<HEADLINE> Microsoft Defends Antitrust Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- As a small Danbury software company  
wrapped up its antitrust case against Microsoft Corp. Wednesday, 
the maker of Windows challenged the company's claims that it cannot 
survive without Microsoft technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol Technology Inc. makes a product called Wind/U, which  
allows programs, such as word processors and spreadsheets, which 
are Windows compatible, to be converted for use on computers with 
other operating systems, such as Unix. 
</P>
<P>
	The company sued Microsoft after they could not reach an  
agreement on a new contract to give Bristol access to source code, 
or software blueprints, for Windows NT, an operating system 
designed to work with powerful corporate computers. From 1994-97, 
Microsoft had a contract with Bristol to provide source code for an 
earlier version of Windows NT. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, a lawyer for Microsoft grilled Bristol's final  
witness, co-founder Jean Blackwell, about why the company had 
assured some customers that Bristol was doing fine without 
Microsoft source code when one of the claims made by the lawsuit is 
that Bristol will not be able to survive without it. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney David Tulchin focused on two letters Blackwell sent to  
potential customers after the lawsuit was filed last August, in 
which she wrote, ``The lawsuit does not affect our current or new 
Wind/U customers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tulchin suggested that the upbeat message Blackwell had in the  
letters is much different than Bristol's current claims. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was trying to save this business,'' Blackwell said. ``I  
needed to make sure we didn't lose everything overnight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tulchin also asked Blackwell about an e-mail in which a member  
of Bristol's board of directors referred to the ``We sue Microsoft 
for money business plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blackwell said the e-mail -- written in May 1998, three months  
before Bristol filed its lawsuit -- discussed the director's 
thoughts about the worst-case scenario, if all of Bristol's 
business dried up, then the company could try to become a 
consulting shop. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft called its first witness, James Allchin, a senior vice  
president and top computer scientist at Microsoft, but did not have 
time to get to any substantive questioning before court ended for 
the day. Allchin is scheduled to be back on the stand when the 
trial resumes Thursday.

<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- To get an idea of the mystery surrounding  
suspected serial killer Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, consider there's 
even skepticism about whether that's his real name. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really doubt it,'' said Sgt. Ken Macha, the West University  
Police lead investigator in one of the eight slayings the fugitive 
is suspected of committing. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the first name he used in 1976 when he was deported  
by the INS and that's what we went ahead with,'' Macha said. ``But 
as far as being real, I would doubt it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under a variety of birthdates and social security numbers,  
Resendez-Ramirez repeatedly has slipped in and out of the country, 
seemingly at will. His description on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted List 
includes 30 aliases. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a master of disguise,'' says Luisa Aquino, an Immigration  
and Naturalization Service spokeswoman in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Now investigators are trying to determine what may have driven  
Resendez-Ramirez from burglary to what authorities said is a 
multi-state killing spree. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's almost as if he woke up someday and snapped,'' Macha  
said. ``There's no clear progression of violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tattooed ex-convict, who is believed to be age 38, is wanted  
in connection with five killings in Texas and at least two more in 
Illinois, and has been tied to a 1997 slaying in Kentucky. 
Investigators believe he is making his way from town to town by 
hopping freight trains. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the FBI said Resendez-Ramirez was in Louisville,  
Ky., as recently as Friday. The FBI said interviews with witnesses 
suggested the suspect had frequented a downtown homeless shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	Later that day, FBI agents in El Paso said a law enforcement  
officer saw Resendez-Ramirez in the area earlier this month. They 
warned he might return because he has family across the U.S.-Mexico 
border in Ciudad Juarez. 
</P>
<P>
	All the slayings took place near railroad tracks, and most  
victims were bludgeoned. Fingerprints have tied Resendez-Ramirez to 
at least some of the killings, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators are unsure about a motive, although items were  
stolen in several of the cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I do know is that if this person is the person we suspect  
in these crimes, it's a very dangerous and violent person,'' said 
Don K. Clark, agent in charge of the FBI's Houston office, where 
the probe is headquartered. ``I think he can be considered Public 
Enemy No. 1 right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the INS, Resendez-Ramirez first came to the  
attention of authorities in 1976, when he illegally tried to enter 
the United States from his native Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	He was deported two months later, the first of at least four  
deportations and numerous run-ins with U.S. authorities. He said he 
was age 16 at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Resendez-Ramirez has been arrested as many as 10 times from  
coast to coast. He has spent time in federal prison and at state 
prisons in Florida and New Mexico. Most of his history involves 
burglary and getting caught trying to illegally obtain or use 
American identification. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI said he is a native of Puebla, Mexico, stands  
5-foot-7-inches and weighs about 150 pounds, with black hair and 
brown eyes. He has scars on his right ring finger, left wrist and 
forehead, a snake tattoo on his left arm and perhaps a flower 
tattoo on his left wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes he has worn a mustache, other times he's clean-shaven.  
Sometimes he wears glasses. He is believed to be an alcohol and 
drug user, although his criminal past does not appear to indicate 
that. 
</P>
<P>
	Resendez-Ramirez has described himself as an orphan, but  
investigators speaking on condition of anonymity said he has at 
least one stepsister in New Mexico, others in Mexico and still 
others believed to be in the upper Midwest around the Great Lakes 
and Vermont. Texas Rangers have interviewed some family members but 
have declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	He is suspected in an August 1997 killing in Lexington, Ky.; the  
killing last December of a doctor during a burglary at her home in 
a Houston enclave; the slayings in April of a pastor and his wife 
at their home in Weimar, midway between Houston and San Antonio; 
the June 4 killing of a 73-year-old woman outside Houston; and the 
killing of a Houston woman the following day. On Monday, he was 
charged with the slaying last week of a father and daughter in 
Gorham, Ill.

<HEADLINE> Sweden 3, Australia 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANDOVER, Md. (AP) -- Hanna Ljungberg scored twice Wednesday  
night as Sweden moved into position for a berth in the Women's 
World Cup quarterfinals with a 3-1 victory over Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Ljungberg netted in the 21st and 69th minutes and was denied a  
hat trick by goaltender Belinda Kitching's diving left-handed save 
on a breakaway in the 65th. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory moved Sweden, the fifth-place finisher as host of  
the 1995 World Cup, into second place in Group D with one victory 
and one loss to group favorite China. A victory over Ghana on 
Saturday would move Sweden into the round of eight. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia, which tied Ghana in its opener, needs a victory over  
China on Saturday to have any hope of reaching the quarterfinals. 
The Matildas finished last at the World Cup four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Before 16,448 at the cavernous 80,000-seat Jack Kent Cooke  
Stadium, Sweden took the lead in the ninth minute when Jane 
Tornqvist, untouched by the far post, headed in Malin Andersson's 
corner kick. Kristin Bengtsson's perfect cross from the right wing 
found Ljungberg open at close range to make it 2-0 in the 21st. 
</P>
<P>
	Julie Murray, who lived in nearby McLean, Va., from 1979-1982  
while her father worked at the Australian Embassy, scored 
Australia's lone goal in the 32nd minute when she blocked a pass by 
Bridgette Starr and scored on a 30-yard run for her second goal of 
the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	But Murray was Australia's only offensive threat, and the Swedes  
surrounded her at every opportunity. Murray had one other good 
scoring opportunity, in second-half injury time, but goalkeeper 
Ulrika Karlsson stretched wide to make the save. 
</P>
<P>
	Ljungberg sealed the victory in the 65th when she beat Kitching  
and tentative defender Sarah Cooper to the ball at the top of the 
penalty box and rolled in the shot from 18 yards.

	War Crimes Probe Makes Progress  
</P>
<P>
	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal  
is looking for evidence to support its indictments of Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic and four associates, and the tribunal 
said Wednesday it is making progress. The investigators are touring 
parts of Kosovo believed to hold evidence of atrocities. Deputy 
prosecutor Graham Blewitt said almost all of the tribunal's teams 
are in the area and are working with investigators from Western 
nations.

to returned home Wednesday after flying bombing missions over 
Yugoslavia. About 200 people waved American flags and red, white 
and blue balloons as eight B-52 bombers landed at this north 
Louisiana military base. The Barksdale forces have been involved in 
their Eastern European mission since Feb. 20. They led NATO air 
strikes on Kosovo and Serbia in late March. The crews will get a 
day off for recuperation for every six days on their mission.

	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Al Gore made a final dash Wednesday for donor  
dollars in California before a June 30 deadline to report 
fund-raising totals, hoping a hefty campaign treasury will show his 
strength. The Democratic vice president picked up $125,000 at his 
first stop in the San Diego community of La Jolla, deep in 
Republican territory. Aides said they were still working on a total 
dollar figure for the fund-raising swing this week. Gore's 
fund-raising flurry began in Denver Tuesday and accelerated in 
California, where he scheduled four fund-raisers in two days. He 
also was raising money Friday in Detroit.

announced Wednesday, will speed the shift away from the

deficit in the finals. This was a true team effort, not just a 
bunch of guys riding along on the coattails of Tim Duncan and David 
Robinson, who scored 28 and 14 points, respectively. Mario Elie had 
18, Avery Johnson and Sean Elliott scored 14 apiece as all of San 
Antonio's starters reached double figures.

<HEADLINE> Long-Distance Access Fees Falling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Long-distance companies will see reductions in  
the access charges they pay local phone companies to connect calls 
beginning on July 1, after a federal court decided to temporarily 
set aside its ruling that the way the fees were calculated wasn't 
adequately explained. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia last  
month ordered the Federal Communications Commission to review part 
of a 1997 decision that resulted in lower phone bills for millions 
of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said the FCC did not adequately explain certain  
changes in a complex formula that affects the access payments that 
long-distance companies pay local phone companies to connect calls. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Tuesday, the court granted the FCC's motion to suspend  
the order, allowing the charge reductions to go into effect while 
the commission reviews its rationale for making changes to the 
so-called ``X Factor.'' Expressed as a percentage, the factor aims 
at ensuring that as a local phone company's productivity improves, 
the company would receive less from these access payments. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC said the reductions in access charges on July 1 could  
translate into big savings for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``If long distance companies pass these savings along to their  
customers, consumers will see a half billion dollars in long 
distance savings,'' FCC Chairman Bill Kennard said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997 the FCC made some adjustments that caused the access  
fees to be reduced by more than $1 billion.

<HEADLINE> Kournikova Avoids Personal Question </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Tennis questions anyone?  
</P>
<P>
	Not when it's an interview with 18-year-old Russian tennis  
starlet Anna Kournikova. 
</P>
<P>
	After a few polite inquiries about her third-round match  
Wednesday, a 7-5, 6-4 victory over Maria Alejandra, the tabloid-led 
British press got serious. 
</P>
<P>
	Kournikova said after her victory on Monday that she didn't have  
a boyfriend despite being seen recently holding hands with NHL star 
Sergei Federov. A photo this week of Kournikova wearing a diamond 
ring fueled further speculation about her personal life. 
</P>
<P>
	A sampling of Wednesday's interview:  
</P>
<P>
	Q: Anna, can I ask whether you have a boyfriend?  
</P>
<P>
	A: No comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Q: You told us the other day you didn't have a boyfriend.  
</P>
<P>
	A: I said no comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Q: Do you have a ring on your third finger?  
</P>
<P>
	A: I have no comment on that. I'm wearing everything all the  
time, every time different, so it's not like I'm wearing something 
that means something. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Are you engaged to anybody?  
</P>
<P>
	A: No comment. I can say it one more time. No comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Q: Anna, it's hardly fair if you go on about it one time and  
then do something the next day which completely contradicts what 
you said before. You can understand why ... 
</P>
<P>
	A: I didn't say anything. I said no comment last time.  
</P>
<P>
	Q: You said you didn't have a boyfriend last time, and then  
suddenly you're seeing Sergei and the ring and stuff ...

<HEADLINE> Hatch Preparing for 2000 Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, who says it probably  
would take a miracle for him to win the White House, intends to 
seek re-election to Congress at the same time he makes a late 
entrance into the Republican presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	One day after saying he will join the GOP race dominated by  
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, Hatch also announced the hiring of his 
first two aides in New Hampshire. Both men will resign their jobs 
with the state GOP to join Hatch's first-in-the nation primary 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	One senior adviser, Sal Russo, said Hatch had been discussing a  
possible race for some time, and had decided to move ahead after 
reviewing the results of a survey taken by Richard Wirthlin, the 
veteran Republican pollster. 
</P>
<P>
	Russo, a consultant who works in California, said that besides  
the funds raised for the poll, Hatch had only begun raising 
campaign money in the last few days. Another GOP official, who 
spoke on condition of anonymity, said Hatch, a Mormon, hopes to be 
able to create a network of Mormon donors to fuel his early 
campaign effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Republicans who have spoken to Hatch in recent days said  
the senator is realistic about the odds facing him, particularly 
given Bush's overwhelming advantages in fund-raising and his 
widespread backing by the GOP establishment. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch indicated as much in comments to reporters on Tuesday.  
``My life has been filled with impossibilities,'' he said. ``My 
life has been filled with miracles. I believe in miracles. It would 
probably take that to elect me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like others in the race, Hatch said he wants to be in a position  
to capitalize if Bush stumbles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The voters haven't focused yet,'' said Russo, adding that none  
of the other contenders in the race has succeeded in solidifying a 
base of support in the conservative wing of the party. 
</P>
<P>
	Russo conceded there were ``certain impediments'' to a campaign  
starting as late as Hatch's. 
</P>
<P>
	And the logisitical ground to be made up is considerable.  
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Kasich, who is also hoping to emerge as an alternative  
to Bush, has a staff of roughly 20 aides, and offices in New 
Hampshire and Iowa as well as Washington and Columbus, the capital 
of his home state of Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich has made nine separate campaign trips to New Hampshire  
since January, according to Todd Harris, a campaign spokesman who 
was added to the payroll on Jan. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who has raised more than $15 million thus far, enjoys the  
support of more than 100 House members and more than a dozen 
senators, many of whom met with him yesterday. His candidacy also 
has been embraced by more than a dozen fellow governors, all of 
whom can provide political assistance when their states hold 
primaries. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, Hatch issued his first campaign press release  
during the day, announcing the hiring of Ken Egan and Patrick Hynes 
in New Hampshire. And while the announcement bore the inscription 
``paid for and authorized by Orrin Hatch for president exploratory 
committee,'' a spokesman said the formal paperwork to establish the 
committee has not yet been filed. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time Hatch moves ahead with his presidential bid,  
his Senate spokesman, Paul Smith, said the Utah Republican will run 
for a fifth Senate term next year. Under a newly enacted state law, 
he is permitted to do so, and would have to give up his spot on the 
state ballot only if he wins the presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch, 65, is chairman of the Judiciary Committee and in his  
fourth Senate term. He is a shoo-in for re-election in his 
conservative, Republican-dominated state. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch got a cold reception to the presidential race from the  
camp of one rival. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyn Nofziger, who advises Pat Buchanan, said, ``I think Orrin  
Hatch is a tool of George W. Bush. He picks up the Mormon 
conservative vote that otherwise would go to Pat and Gary Bauer. 
The votes will be split, allowing Bush to go into some of these 
states and win without much of a fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Within the Senate, Hatch has shown an ability both to cooperate  
with Democrats and to fight them. He held up all of President 
Clinton's judicial nominees for months this year in hopes of 
gaining a nomination to the bench for a fellow Utahn. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet he angered many Republicans last winter when he suggested --  
in advance of Clinton's impeachment -- that a censure or some other 
lesser form of penalty be considered. Hatch eventually voted to 
convict Clinton on both impeachment charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch grew up in Pittsburgh, and told reporters recently he had  
worked as a janitor as he paid his own way through college. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did have an impoverished background and can appreciate not  
only the hopes and dreams of people but also their fears and 
worries,'' said Russo.

<HEADLINE> Bush Seeking Help for Iowa Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush, the self-styled political  
outsider running for the GOP presidential nomination, is turning to 
Washington's lobbying elite to help cement his front-runner status. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor is asking business lobbyists to organize his  
efforts to win the Iowa straw poll in August, according to an 
internal memo criticized by his GOP rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	The memo suggests that Bush is making an all-out push to win the  
early test of campaign strength in Ames, Iowa, and it underscores 
that Bush brings enormous political resources to the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	In the memo, Iowa organizer Sarah Taylor says the campaign's  
goal is to ``organize through supportive Washington trade 
associations-companies to mobilize and turn out 700 Iowans who 
would probably not otherwise attend the straw poll on August 
14th.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She asks supporters to identify ``friendly national  
organizations'' and to persuade 50 of them to turn out 15 Iowans 
each to the straw poll. ``In some cases, companies will be able to 
fill a bus, thus allowing for fewer trade associations that need to 
be worked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The memo was obtained by The Associated Press on Wednesday and  
confirmed as authentic by the Bush campaign, which said it was 
mailed Tuesday. Soliciting interests groups for help to organize 
Iowa is not unusual, but the scope of Bush's plans are another sign 
of his political strength and eagerness to dominate the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are late in arriving to the field and we're trying to  
mobilize our resources,'' Bush spokesman Dave Beckwith said. ``I 
can't imagine if you're working seriously at winning you wouldn't 
try to use every resource to get out supporters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Bush far ahead in polls, money-raising and endorsements,  
the memo provided his GOP foes ammunition to portray him as a 
political insider. Bush promises to change the ways of Washington 
and calls Vice President Al Gore a candidate of the ``status quo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just another clear indication of how tied to the  
Washington lobbying and establishment crowd Mr. Bush is,'' said 
Bill Dal Col, campaign manager for Steve Forbes. ``He is now 
demonstrating that he will accomplish nothing if elected because he 
will be bought, sold and owned by the lobbyists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just using Iowans to recruit Iowans,'' said Brian  
Kennedy, political director for Lamar Alexander. ``He's the 
candidate of Washington, and he's using a lot of outside interest 
groups to come into Iowa and support him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A respected Iowa-based consultant allied with a rival campaign,  
speaking on condition of anonymity, said the non-Bush campaigns are 
working together to fashion similar messages. 
</P>
<P>
	The memo refers to an attached list of trade associations and  
lobbyists that might help Bush. It is a Who's Who in lobbying 
circles, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National 
Mining Association, the Association of Builders and Contractors, 
and the Union Pacific railroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Peggy Ellis, director of congressional affairs at the Republican  
National Committee, is on the list, even though RNC officials are 
supposed to be neutral in GOP primaries. Ellis said she was never 
contacted by the Bush campaign about the Iowa effort. Beckwith said 
her name was crossed out in a final draft of the memo, along with 
nine others who could not help the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The list is labeled ``Incumbent Retention Business Members.''  
Beckwith said it came from the Republican House campaign committee 
and was used as a starting point for contacting potential 
organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for the House GOP committee said the list is  
provided to lobbyists on the incumbent retention team, which helps 
GOP lawmakers retain their seats. The list was given to the Bush 
campaign by one of the lobbyists on the list, not the House 
campaign committee, said the spokeswoman, Jill Schroeder. 
</P>
<P>
	Dal Col said the list suggests that the Republican Party is  
violating its pledge to be neutral. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Beckwith: ``Governor Bush has friends all over the country  
and is proud of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The help of trade associations would be treated as an in-kind  
contribution under federal laws, which limit such donations to 
$5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Providing a rare window into the inner workings of a campaign,  
the memo says the 50 trade groups should be identified by July 9. 
``That would give us four weeks to work them and gather names, 
addresses and phone numbers of those who are attending. Our goal 
will be to have 700 names by Friday, Aug. 6. This will give us one 
week to focus on turnout,'' the Taylor memo says. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our only regret about this leaking out,'' Beckwith said with a  
sigh, ``is that is may give the other campaigns ideas.''

<HEADLINE> Many Students Head to Summer School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Lisa Laird will spend her summer writing  
short stories and doing science experiments. 
</P>
<P>
	While her mother, Kathleen Laird, is excited about the extended  
learning opportunity offered by the Arlington County school 
district's Summer Laureate program, Lisa, who's 6, is excited about 
summer school for another reason. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get to ride the bus,'' Lisa said after her mother dropped  
her off at the Oakridge Elementary school kindergarten this week on 
the last day of the regular school year. ``I've never done that 
before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lisa also remembers that she'll get to read more books.  
</P>
<P>
	For Lisa's mother, a research scientist who is among thousands  
of parents sending their children to summer school this year, it's 
not about boosting test scores: 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm more concerned that she can grow intellectually. It's  
really going to be a focal point of the summer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Higher standards are motivating more students to spend their  
free time catching up or moving ahead. In response, the summer 
school trend is heating up. Enrollments have climbed and so have 
expenses. The Education Department estimates 10 percent of U.S. 
students stick around for summer school. 
</P>
<P>
	Policies to retain students not quite ready for the next grade  
drive many summer school enrollments -- particularly 52,000 students 
in New York, 6,000 in Denver, 150,000 in Los Angeles and a record 
30,000, or 40 percent of total enrollment, in District of Columbia 
schools. Hot new summer camps and fun activities, provided by 
districts, cities and even parent groups, are providing convenient 
child care for working parents and a safe, productive place for 
younger children and non-working high-schoolers to spend their 
summer days. 
</P>
<P>
	``Parents really want an academically fulfilling summer for  
their children,'' said Jim McCowan, who coordinates summer school 
for Arlington, which expects 7,000 of the 18,000 students in the 
district to enroll this summer. That is up from 4,800 summer school 
students in 1994. ``We've had quite a demand for the enrichment 
opportunities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For classes beginning July 6, students have signed up for  
courses that bring diplomats from Washington embassies to talk 
about their countries and scientists from the Smithsonian to 
discuss dinosaurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Peart's children -- Shanika, 13, and Earl, 14, -- have gone  
to summer school nearly every year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It keeps their skills up to par,'' said Peart, an Arlington  
schools secretary who also will work in the summer school program 
this year. ``It keeps them off the street and takes them out from 
in front of the Playstation,'' a video game player. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people are probably using it as a baby sitting service,  
Peart admits, ``but the children are not home alone and it's 
teaching them something in the process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The district pays for the programming mostly through fees, about  
$200 per class with a sliding income scale. 
</P>
<P>
	Summer school can be costly, particularly if classes are  
required. New York's program, for example, will cost about $70 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Costs forced some districts to cut back. In San Diego, parents  
stepped in to create summer enrichment classes for their children. 
</P>
<P>
	``Children have a natural hunger for learning,'' said Carolyn  
Wood of Gateways, a nonprofit school that expects 2,000 students 
this summer for classes mainly in arts and foreign languages. 
``Parents need to feed that like food at the dinner table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gateways grew from a 1982 word-of-mouth enrollment of 600  
students. Parents are eager to have their children get the arts and 
science training that the district often can't afford to give 
during the school year, Wood said, making waiting lists common for 
courses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many families plan vacations around our dates,'' Wood added.  
</P>
<P>
	And enough do that to affect summer tourism, said Roy Cook, a  
business professor at Fort Lewis College in Durango, Colo., who has 
studied the increase in year-round school calendars. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are in school more, and that's pushing vacations into  
different time periods,'' he said, noting that more families are 
taking trips together right before school starts, just after it 
ends or during regular school-year holidays. Families are also 
saving money by avoiding the peak midsummer travel times. 
</P>
<P>
	Marilyn Hamannwright's two boys are going to summer school in  
Arlington -- one for three weeks, the other for five. But since her 
husband owns a bicycle store, they vacation in October over a 
school fall break when business is a little slower. 
</P>
<P>
	Education Department figures for summer enrollments haven't been  
updated from 1996. But some educators, gauging a lingering 
resistance to summer schooling, are campaigning for even more 
summer learning. 
</P>
<P>
	``For those who don't need summer school, learning has come to a  
screeching halt,'' said Linda Walker-Hill, who is publicizing a 
summer learning campaign for the American School Counselors 
Association, Sylvan Learning Centers and the National Association 
for Gifted Children. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker-Hill said teachers in many districts report that student  
reading in the summer drops off significantly, even among children 
who are doing well in their classes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal is to develop lifelong, year-round learning,'' she  
said, ``and every kid can benefit from that.''

<HEADLINE> Office Depot To Warn About Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Office Depot has agreed to post signs  
warning customers that merchandise may not be Y2K compliant, 
settling a lawsuit that accused the retailer of failing to alert 
buyers to potential problems in the software they sell. 
</P>
<P>
	Office Depot, of Delray Beach, Fla. also said it would provide  
manufacturer's Web addresses and phone numbers to help consumers 
check the products out, include Y2K information in their Sunday 
advertisements, and provide customers with an informational 
brochure. 
</P>
<P>
	Six other retailers also were targeted in the lawsuit filed by  
Tom Johnson, a Concord swim coach who got frustrated when store 
clerks couldn't say whether their new products were Y2K compatible. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit, filed last January, alleged that Circuit City, Fry's  
Electronics, The Good Guys, CompUSA, Staples, OfficeMax and Office 
Depot's lack of notice about Y2K problems is a violation of 
California's Unfair Competition Law. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many consumers believe that the Y2K problem will only affect  
older products and mainframe computers or large corporate 
networks,'' said Johnson's lawyer, Rich Ergo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many products sold today are not compliant.''  
</P>
<P>
	Ergo begins court-mandated settlement talks on July 15 with the  
six other companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit is the first to target retailers. Most lawsuits have  
gone after software manufacturers for selling products that will 
allegedly become defective by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Judges have rejected most of those claims because no consumer  
has actually been damaged yet.

<HEADLINE> Ozawa To Direct Vienna State Opera </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- During his 25 years conducting the Boston Symphony  
Orchestra, Seiji Ozawa, with his wild hair and such flair at the 
podium that he could be a beauty to behold, has had an appeal that 
reached educated listeners and casual concertgoers alike. 
</P>
<P>
	With the news of his decision to leave for the Vienna State  
Opera in 2002, Boston was abuzz Wednesday with speculation about 
who could possibly replace his star quality. 
</P>
<P>
	Ozawa's tenure at the BSO -- he is the longest-serving current  
music director of any major orchestra -- makes him Boston's answer 
to Cal Ripken Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	``For most people in this community, Seiji personifies the  
Boston Symphony,'' said Catherine Peterson, executive director of 
Arts Boston, a nonprofit group that markets Boston's arts. 
</P>
<P>
	The crossover appeal of Seiji (never ``Ozawa'' in Boston) is  
apparent when he goes to Red Sox games, where vendors badger him 
with requests to sign their napkins. New England Patriots fans -- 
who share his passion for quarterback Drew Bledsoe -- have grown 
used to his conducting the national anthem before games. And he 
once got in trouble for almost missing a performance because he had 
gone to New Orleans to see the Patriots play in the 1997 Super 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	It's no exaggeration to say his face graces millions of  
Massachusetts tourism brochures in airports and travel agencies 
around the world, said Pat Moscaritolo, president of the Greater 
Boston Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	The 63-year-old maestro has been criticized for having spats  
with his musicians, for purging some longtime musicians at 
Tanglewood, the orchestra's renowned summer training institute for 
musicians, and for sometimes being too extravagant or too 
technical. 
</P>
<P>
	But there also was his flair, his energy and his perfectionism.  
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Nicholas T. Zervas, chairman of the BSO trustees, said Ozawa  
was ``a sheer beauty to behold on the podium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His perfectly fluid stick technique is probably the best on the  
planet, said Brian Bell, who produces the BSO's live performances 
on WGBH radio. 
</P>
<P>
	Under his leadership, the BSO expanded its repertoire; he  
brought in one great player after another; and he drew an emotional 
intensity from the orchestra that audiences respond to viscerally, 
said Carl Vigeland, who wrote ``In Concert,'' a journalist's 
account of a year in the life of the symphony. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just the sound, the string sound of that orchestra playing  
Mahler last fall, connects emotionally with an audience. That's not 
an accident. That's an achievement that's easy to take for 
granted,'' Vigeland said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Ozawa, the BSO became the biggest-budget orchestra in the  
world, with an endowment that grew from less than $10 million in 
the early 1970s to more than $200 million today. 
</P>
<P>
	He has helped build the orchestra -- which has had its ups and  
downs in its 118-year history -- into an elite international 
orchestra with broad appeal to music aficionados, casual 
concertgoers, foreign tourists and that important but hard-to-reach 
audience, children. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a town that has incredible institutions, but has a  
conservative disposition, Seiji can push. The reality is he forced 
the BSO to think big,'' said Mark Volpe, the general manager of 
what is, under Ozawa, the world's busiest orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson said the short list of potential successors to Ozawa  
includes Christoph Eschenbach, who just stepped down as music 
director of the Houston orchestra; James Conlon, music director of 
the Bastille Opera in Paris; James Levine, artistic director of the 
Metropolitan Opera and chief conductor of the Munich Philharmonic 
Orchestra; and Robert Spano, music director at Brooklyn 
Philharmonic and an assistant conductor under Ozawa. 
</P>
<P>
	Ozawa first conducted the BSO in 1964 as a near-penniless music  
student. He established himself by winning the Koussevitzky Prize 
for outstanding student conductor at Tanglewood and in 1961 became 
assistant conductor of the New York Philharmonic under Leonard 
Bernstein, who was on Tanglewood's faculty. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement of his departure surprised but didn't stun  
Boston's music community, which was aware of Ozawa's desire to 
conduct opera. He has included opera numbers in his concerts for 
two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	With open musical directorships in Philadelphia, Atlanta,  
Houston, Indianapolis and Cincinnati, the Boston orchestra may be 
hard put to find Ozawa's successor. Sir Simon Rattle, who recently 
left the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra in England, was said 
to be considered a top candidate to succeed Ozawa, but on Wednesday 
he was named chief conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic.

<HEADLINE> Wild Horses Causing Trouble in N.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CURRITUCK, N.C. (AP) -- Wild horses have been raiding lawns,  
garbage cans and a produce stand among vacation homes on one of the 
islands of the Outer Banks, and officials are trying to figure out 
what to do. 
</P>
<P>
	The islands are home to about 30 horses, believed to be  
descendants of mustangs left behind by Spanish explorers. 
</P>
<P>
	A fence running across Bodie Island, the northernmost island in  
North Carolina's Outer Banks chain, is supposed to keep them away 
from neighborhoods around the town of Corolla. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a mare and a stallion named Little Red Man have  
repeatedly led their colt and four other horses on raids to the 
south side of the fence. 
</P>
<P>
	The horses were corralled last week, and Currituck County  
officials and conservationists are trying to find them a permanent 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to find an immediate solution to at least the three  
horses,'' Lloyd Childers, executive director of the Outer Banks 
Conservationists, said Tuesday. ``I mean in the next couple of 
weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Horse lover Gene Snow said the stallion could become a huge  
tourist attraction. 
</P>
<P>
	``Little Red Man could be the Misty of Corolla,'' said Snow,  
referring to the children's book that popularized the herds of wild 
horses on Virginia's Chincoteague and Assateague islands.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft To Invest in Concentric </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. will invest $50 million  
in Concentric Networks Inc. under a broad agreement that also calls 
for the two to create a co-branded Internet portal, Dow Jones News 
Service reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal unveiled by Concentric Tuesday, Microsoft agreed  
to extend through 2002 a contract for Concentric to supply network 
services for Microsoft's WebTV service unit. Concentric estimates 
the value of the contract at $150 million to $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
	For its part, Concentric agreed to spend $7.5 million to  
advertise its Internet protocol network services on Microsoft's MSN 
network.

<P>
	LANDOVER, Md. (AP) -- Hanna Ljungberg scored twice Wednesday  
night as Sweden moved into position for a berth in the Women's 
World Cup quarterfinals with a 3-1 victory over Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Ljungberg netted in the 21st and 69th minutes and was denied a  
hat trick by goaltender Belinda Kitching's diving left-handed save 
on a breakaway in the 65th. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory moved Sweden, the fifth-place finisher as host of  
the 1995 World Cup, into second place in Group D with one victory 
and one loss to group favorite China. A victory over Ghana on 
Saturday would move Sweden into the round of eight. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia, which tied Ghana in its opener, needs a victory over  
China on Saturday to have any hope of reaching the quarterfinals. 
The Matildas finished last at the World Cup four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Before 16,448 at the cavernous 80,000-seat Jack Kent Cooke  
Stadium, Sweden took the lead in the ninth minute when Jane 
Tornqvist, untouched by the far post, headed in Malin Andersson's 
corner kick. Kristin Bengtsson's perfect cross from the right wing 
found Ljungberg open at close range to make it 2-0 in the 21st. 
</P>
<P>
	Julie Murray, who lived in nearby McLean, Va., from 1979-1982  
while her father worked at the Australian Embassy, scored 
Australia's lone goal in the 32nd minute when she blocked a pass by 
Bridgette Starr and scored on a 30-yard run for her second goal of 
the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	But Murray was Australia's only offensive threat, and the Swedes  
surrounded her at every opportunity. Murray had one other good 
scoring opportunity, in second-half injury time, but goalkeeper 
Ulrika Karlsson stretched wide to make the save. 
</P>
<P>
	Ljungberg sealed the victory in the 65th when she beat Kitching  
and tentative defender Sarah Cooper to the ball at the top of the 
penalty box and rolled in the shot from 18 yards.

<HEADLINE> Internet Players Counter Kasparov </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After clicking countless computer mice and  
sliding a lowly black pawn forward two spaces, thousands of chess 
enthusiasts await the response of world champion Garry Kasparov, 
who challenged the world to a game in cyberspace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet tournament, called ``Kasparov vs. the World,''  
allows anyone with a modem to join the ``World Team,'' which votes 
on moves against the reigning champion. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Team made the tournament's second move Tuesday, and  
Kasparov has 24 hours to reply. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't usually get an opportunity, even over the computer,  
to play a world champion,'' said Matthew Harding, 15, of Silver 
Spring, Md., who plays at Washington's U.S. Chess Center. Harding 
said that with all the grandmasters who may vote, the World Team 
has a chance to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a lot of people against him, so I'm hoping we can  
generate good moves,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasparov opened the tournament Monday in New York, moving his  
white king's pawn two spaces forward to E4 on a giant board. 
Microsoft's Gaming Zone, the Web site acting as host of the 
tournament, immediately began fielding countermoves from around the 
world and registered more than 2 million hits for the day, said 
spokesman Eddie Ranchigoda. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Team's reply -- chosen by 41 percent of those voting --  
was to move the black pawn in front of the queen's bishop two 
spaces forward to C-5 -- initiating the Sicilian Defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasparov came to Washington's Union Station on Tuesday to  
witness the World Team's move on a 400-square-foot chess board, but 
declined to make another move in order to maintain the 
``suspense,'' said Audrey Waters, Kasparov's spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	After Kasparov does move, the World Team has 24 hours to vote  
for its next move. Kasparov will then reply within another 24 
hours, and so on, until the conclusion of the match, which is 
expected to take most of the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Four young chess experts guide the World Team, suggesting  
possible moves and tactics against Kasparov. The players then cast 
their votes on the experts' recommendations or chose another move. 
</P>
<P>
	After each move, the Web site airs live computer chats on  
coaches' strategies and options. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, Kasparov, regarded by many as the greatest chess  
player ever, lost to IBM's Deep Blue supercomputer. In New York, he 
said this encounter between chess and technology was ``a more 
pleasant event for the human race.''

<HEADLINE> Manny Ramirez Misses Third Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Cleveland Indians' star Manny Ramirez was out of  
the lineup for the third straight night, missing Wednesday night's 
game against the Toronto Blue Jays because of a bruised left index 
finger. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez, who leads the majors with 79 RBIs, left Sunday's game  
after he was hit by a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	``The finger is still sore,'' Ramirez said.  
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove expected Ramirez to return  
Wednesday, but after talking with him, Hargrove changed his lineup 
just before game time. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez is on pace to break Hack Wilson's 69-year old record of  
191 RBIs in a season.

<HEADLINE> McHale, Thompson Go to Hoop Hall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- Kevin McHale, who won three NBA  
championships with the Boston Celtic dynasty, and Georgetown coach 
John Thompson were elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame today. 
</P>
<P>
	Going in with them will be Cal State-Fullerton and UCLA women's  
coach Billie Moore; Wayne Embry, the Cincinnati Royals star and 
general manager of the Cleveland Cavaliers; and the late Fred 
Zollner, who owned the Fort Wayne Pistons and helped found and 
nurture the early NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Brought to the Boston Celtics in 1980 with Robert Parish, McHale  
came in off the bench at first as the team's sixth man. He went on 
to play 12 seasons with Parish and Larry Bird, forming one of the 
greatest NBA frontcourts ever. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, the 6-foot-10 McHale, a forward with long arms that  
helped him to shoot over the top of defenders, made his impact 
largely in the pivot. But he developed an array of nimble offensive 
moves that helped set a modern standard for big men. 
</P>
<P>
	While they were both known as big-game players, the manner of  
the glib McHale provided a foil to Bird's intensity. ``He was kind 
of easygoing, even though he was a competitor,'' said Red Auerbach, 
the Celtic vice chairman and former coach. 
</P>
<P>
	The team won championships in 1981, 1984 and 1986.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1985, McHale set a Celtics record by scoring 56 points  
against the Detroit Pistons. Bird -- rarely far away -- broke the 
record nine days later with 60 against the Atlanta Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
	During his career, McHale averaged 17.9 points and 7.3 rebounds.  
He shot 55 percent from the field. He made seven All-Star teams and 
three All-NBA defensive teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, who acted as a Boston Celtic backup center for Bill  
Russell on the 1965 and 1966 championship teams, arrived at 
Georgetown in 1972. He inherited a program with a 3-23 record. 
</P>
<P>
	During the next 27 seasons, his Hoya teams went 596-239. They  
made the NCAA tournament 14 straight times, played in three Final 
Fours, and won the national championship in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson also coached the 1988 U.S. Olympic men's team. It won a  
bronze medal. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson surprised the basketball world in January, when he  
retired in mid-season for personal reasons.

<HEADLINE> Theater Revives 'Twentieth Century' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	EAST HADDAM, Conn. (AP) -- Betty Comden and Adolph Green:  
lyricists associated with brash, brassy musicals celebrating New 
York, such as ``On the Town'' and ``Wonderful Town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cy Coleman: a composer known for his rhythmic, jazzy scores for  
such shows as ``Sweet Charity'' and ``City of Angels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Who would have thought the three could cook up a stylish  
screwball souffle like ``On the Twentieth Century,'' a musical that 
never got the attention it deserved. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the show, which opened on Broadway in 1978, ran for a  
year, it rarely has been revived. Now it has been given a rehearing 
in a mostly spiffy production the Goodspeed Opera House hopes to 
send out on a national tour in late summer 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Goodspeed edition is far removed, at least scenically, from  
the Broadway original, which featured lavish art-deco sets by Robin 
Wagner. Those re-creations of a sleek 1930s railroad train are what 
most people who saw the show 20 years ago still talk about. Yet 
James Noone's new vest-pocket version, mostly a series of doors and 
two train compartments, works just fine. 
</P>
<P>
	But there's always been more to ``On the Twentieth Century''  
than the sets, a fact this revival makes clear. ``Century'' is a 
fast-paced show, with an abundance of melody and wit, two qualities 
in short supply in Broadway musicals last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Comden and Green did an excellent job transforming the 1934 film  
into musical comedy. Coleman's buoyant, operetta-like music 
couldn't be better suited to the farcical story and to the clever 
lyrics of Comden and Green. There is a unity to the score that few 
songwriting teams achieve, but Coleman, Comden and Green did it 
here. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the Twentieth Century'' rises and falls on the strengths of  
its two lead performers. Most important is the actor playing Oscar 
Jaffee, the shameless -- and penniless -- producer who must hightail 
it out of Chicago after his stage version of ``Joan of Arc'' is 
burned -- critically speaking -- at the stake. 
</P>
<P>
	The desperate impresario needs a hit and who better to provide  
it than Lily Garland -- his stage discovery who went on to fame to 
Hollywood. They meet aboard the Twentieth Century Limited, as it 
travels to New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a pleasure to watch Mark Jacoby, as the flamboyant Jaffee,  
break out from his previous stuffed-shirt roles of Gaylord Ravenal 
in ``Show Boat'' and Father in ``Ragtime.'' Jacoby gets Jaffee's 
debonair hamminess just right. He also has the robust, booming 
voice to go with such an outsized character. 
</P>
<P>
	Donna English, as the tempestuous Lily, doesn't quite hold her  
own against Jacoby. The actress is a veteran of the wonderfully 
wacky ``Forbidden Broadway'' revues, but she seems a bit subdued 
here. English needs to match her co-star's outlandishness, both in 
her acting and vocal delivery. 
</P>
<P>
	The plot hinges on Jaffee finding financing for his new show -- a  
biblical epic about Mary Magdalene, no less -- and then signing Lily 
to a contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Jaffee gets the promise of money from Letitia Peabody Primrose,  
a ditsy religious fanatic, whose mental condition sets up the 
show's most uproarious number -- ``She's a Nut.'' The song evolves 
into a chase worthy of the Keystone Kops, thanks to Peggy Hickey's 
inventive choreography. Hickey's tap-dancing train porters also 
contribute mightily to the show's movement. 
</P>
<P>
	There is fine second-banana support from Michael McCormick and  
Peter Van Wagner as Jaffee's exasperated minions. Jan Neuberger's 
Letitia is suitably loony, if a little wobbly vocally. Tony Lawson 
overdoes the role of Bruce Granit, Lily's chiseled-chin boyfriend. 
The strain shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Director Ted Pappas marshals the cast well. They are off and  
running as soon as the nifty overture is finished, and don't stop 
until the overwrought producer and his temperamental star are more 
or less reunited. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the Twentieth Century'' is high-style musical farce, done  
here in a manner that, for the most part, doesn't slight either its 
madcap plot or its merry melodies. 
</P>
<P>
	The production runs through July 3.

<HEADLINE>  Coke Production To Resume in Belgium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Coca-Cola Co. prepared to resume  
Belgian production Thursday after the government agreed to let two 
factories re-open under strict conditions, two weeks after the 
first reports of illnesses from children who drank the company's 
soft drinks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our products are completely safe, both in Belgium and  
worldwide,'' M. Douglas Ivester, Coca-Cola's chairman, said 
Wednesday, then sipped a bottle of Coke as he addressed reporters 
in his first news conference since the health scare began June 9. 
</P>
<P>
	But a Coca-Cola plant in nearby northern France remained closed  
as judicial officials opened an investigation to determine why 
hundreds of people who drank from cans produced there fell ill. Rat 
poison was detected on the outside of one soft-drink can, but no 
cause of the illnesses has been detected, said Francois Muguet, a 
state prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Belgian government, meantime, continued to ban imports on  
beverages produced at the Coca-Cola plant at Dunkirk, France. 
</P>
<P>
	But it agreed Wednesday to allow Coca-Cola to resume production  
at factories in the Belgian communities of Antwerp and Ghent. 
Without determining the cause, the country's top health official 
termed the illnesses an accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivester said it would take about two weeks to build up full  
distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quite honestly, we let the people of Belgium down,'' Ivester  
said Wednesday, a day after Coke purchased ads in papers throughout 
Belgium to apologize for the health scare. 
</P>
<P>
	Belgium's health minister, Luc Van den Bossche, said that since  
June 9, there had been 249 cases of illnesses reported in Belgium 
by people who drank Coca-Cola products. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivester said Coca-Cola would pay the medical bills of anyone who  
had fallen ill after drinking Coke products, though he denied the 
drinks posed any health risk. 
</P>
<P>
	But lawsuits already are in the works.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have started an initial legal complaint against Coca-Cola  
because we want to know what happened,'' said Odilon Hermans, 
director of the St. Mary School in Bornem near Antwerp. 
</P>
<P>
	Hermans said four students who drank Coke two weeks ago are  
still too sick to return to classes, suffering exhaustion and lack 
of concentration. Of the 280 students at his school, 39 became sick 
after drinking Coke products and 15 spent a night in the hospital, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	With Coca-Cola removed from many European shelves, rival Pepsi  
said it was meeting an increased demand for its soft drinks. 
</P>
<P>
	But spokesman Jeff Brown at Pepsi's headquarters in Purchase,  
N.Y., said the company is not trying to play up Coke's problems. He 
said Pepsi issued ``a worldwide memo directing international 
managers that they're not to exploit the situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said warm weather and summer sales were boosting Pepsi  
sales in addition to the temporary withdrawal of competing products 
from the world's largest soft-drink company. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a good summer for Pepsi. It's hard to attribute  
incrementally the increased demand,'' Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola stock fell 87 1/2 cents to $61.75 a share Wednesday on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where PepsiCo Inc., the parent of 
Pepsi, was off 25 cents at $35.81 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivester acknowledged that the Coca-Cola had been slow to respond  
to consumer concerns about the health fears that led to bans in 
Belgium and beyond on Coke and other company brands including Diet 
Coke, Fanta, Sprite. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that after consulting with Belgian health officials,  
both sides decided on a low-key approach to prevent the 
investigation from being conducted in the media. 
</P>
<P>
	At a separate media briefing, Coke bottles lined a table as  
government officials outlined the new sanitary conditions imposed 
at the Coca-Cola plants. But the Coke bottles remained capped and 
the ministry aides drank Belgian bottled water. 
</P>
<P>
	Van den Bossche said government scientists were unable to  
establish a clear cause for the problem, but said it appeared to 
have been caused by ``an accident during production or transport'' 
that was unlikely to happen again if proper precautions for hygiene 
were maintained. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola maintains that there were two problems -- a production  
problem in Antwerp that allowed sulfur compounds to mix with the 
carbon dioxide used to make Coke products bubbly, which gave it a 
``rotten egg'' smell and taste. Creosote on wooden shipping pallets 
also gave some Antwerp-produced cans of Coke a bad smell and taste, 
Coca-Cola said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this case, a couple of our quality control procedures broke  
down,'' Ivester said. 
</P>
<P>
	Van den Bossche, who is also Belgium's Interior minister, said  
the lifting of the production ban would have been announced Tuesday 
were it not for late word of an extortion attempt against Coke last 
month in Germany. The minister said Wednesday he now is satisfied 
there is no link between the production problems and the extortion 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the threat were not disclosed, but a European  
Coca-Cola executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the 
German extortion attempt was unrelated to the problems in France or 
Belgium.

of concentration. Of the 280 students at his school, 39 became sick 
after drinking Coke products and 15 spent a night in the hospital, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	With Coca-Cola removed from many European shelves, rival Pepsi  
said it was meeting an increased demand for its soft drinks. 
</P>
<P>
	But spokesman Jeff Brown at Pepsi's headquarters in Purchase,  
N.Y., said the company is not trying to play up Coke's problems. He 
said Pepsi issued ``a worldwide memo directing international 
managers that they're not to exploit the situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said warm weather and summer sales were boosting Pepsi  
sales in addition to the temporary withdrawal of competing products 
from the world's largest soft-drink company. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a good summer for Pepsi. It's hard to attribute  
incrementally the increased demand,'' Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola stock fell 87 1/2 cents to $61.75 a share Wednesday on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where PepsiCo Inc., the parent of 
Pepsi, was off 25 cents at $35.81 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivester acknowledged that the Coca-Cola had been slow to respond  
to consumer concerns about the health fears that led to bans in 
Belgium and beyond on Coke and other company brands including Diet 
Coke, Fanta, Sprite. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that after consulting with Belgian health officials,  
both sides decided on a low-key approach to prevent the 
investigation from being conducted in the media. 
</P>
<P>
	At a separate media briefing, Coke bottles lined a table as  
government officials outlined the new sanitary conditions imposed 
at the Coca-Cola plants. But the Coke bottles remained capped and 
the ministry aides drank Belgian bottled water. 
</P>
<P>
	Van den Bossche said government scientists were unable to  
establish a clear cause for the problem, but said it appeared to 
have been caused by ``an accident during production or transport'' 
that was unlikely to happen again if proper precautions for hygiene 
were maintained. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola maintains that there were two problems -- a production  
problem in Antwerp that allowed sulfur compounds to mix with the 
carbon dioxide used to make Coke products bubbly, which gave it a 
``rotten egg'' smell and taste. Creosote on wooden shipping pallets 
also gave some Antwerp-produced cans of Coke a bad smell and taste, 
Coca-Cola said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this case, a couple of our quality control procedures broke  
down,'' Ivester said. 
</P>
<P>
	Van den Bossche, who is also Belgium's Interior minister, said  
the lifting of the production ban would have been announced Tuesday 
were it not for late word of an extortion attempt against Coke last 
month in Germany. The minister said Wednesday he now is satisfied 
there is no link between the production problems and the extortion 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the threat were not disclosed, but a European  
Coca-Cola executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the 
German extortion attempt was unrelated to the problems in France or 
Belgium.

<HEADLINE> Jury Deadlocked in R. Lewis Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The jury in the Reggie Lewis malpractice case told  
a judge Wednesday they had reached verdicts on two consultants in 
the case, but were deadlocked concerning the culpability of the 
lead physician. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury told Suffolk County Judge Thayer Fremont-Smith they  
could not decide whether Dr. Gilbert Mudge's negligence contributed 
to the late Celtics star's death. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury did not disclose its decision regarding the two  
consultants, Drs. Mark Creager and Peter Friedman. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge sent the jurors home for the night and said he would  
re-instruct them Thursday morning. If they continued to be 
deadlocked on Mudge, the judge said, he would hear their decision 
on the consultants. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis' wife had sued Mudge and the consultants, claiming they  
misdiagnosed and mistreated her husband's fatal heart condition. A 
third consultant settled for an undisclosed sum before the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Her attorneys sought $75 million, saying that was the sum Lewis  
would have earned as a professional player. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis collapsed during a playoff game in April 1993 and was  
subsequently diagnosed with a life-threatening, potentially 
career-ending cardiac arrhythmia by a ``Dream Team'' of top doctors 
from New England Baptist Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lewises then turned to Mudge, of Brigham and Women's  
Hospital, who examined Lewis and announced at a news conference the 
player instead had a neurological condition that causes fainting 
spells. Mudge said he probably could return to professional 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	Two months later, on July 27, 1993, Lewis died practicing jump  
shots. He was 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Donna Harris-Lewis had suggested Mudge's judgment  
was clouded by his search for glory as the doctor who proved the 
``Dream Team'' wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	As testimony turned to alleged drug use by the popular athlete,  
Harris-Lewis' attorneys also suggested that Mudge, desperate to 
cover up his mistakes, was ``searching the gutters'' for 
alternative explanations for the death of his most famous patient. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge maintained that Lewis admitted to cocaine use two weeks  
before he died. He said the belated confession made an accurate 
diagnosis impossible and called several convicted felons to testify 
to alleged cocaine and marijuana use by Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge said Lewis also ignored orders not to exercise.  
</P>
<P>
	A third piece of Mudge's defense was that, despite the news  
conference in which he declared Lewis' heart healthy, he privately 
suspected the player might have a serious heart condition -- and was 
treating him with beta blockers that addressed both the fainting 
condition and the possible cardiac problem. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he told the family and the Celtics of his concerns, but  
both groups disputed that claim.

<HEADLINE> Computers Finally Get Slimmer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The bulky, beige personal computer is going on a  
diet. Thanks to ever-shrinking components, manufacturers are 
introducing thinner machines with flat-panel screens that save desk 
space for coffee mugs and family photos. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that your average clunker, which costs less than the svelte  
newcomers, is going away soon. But the arrivals, on display Tuesday 
at the PC Expo trade show here, signal an important deviation from 
the desktops that have cramped workspace and depressed office 
ambiance for nearly two decades. Now, you can buy a well-equipped 
PC for $2,000 that takes up one-quarter the space. 
</P>
<P>
	The unconventional designs, from Sony, Gateway, Packard Bell NEC  
and others, take their cue from Apple Computer's iMac, which shook 
up the world of desktops since its launch last summer. Apple's 
highly popular machine is shaped like a giant jelly bean, equipped 
with a built-in monitor, and comes in five translucent colors 
through which inner circuitry is faintly visible. 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike the iMac, which starts at $900, the new futuristic  
machines cost more than twice as much and are aimed at a smaller 
niche of buyers. The main reason is their space-saving flat-panel 
screens, which use liquid crystal instead of electron beams to show 
data and images and cost four times as much as conventional 
monitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``They look great, but they add a significant chunk to the  
overall price of the system,'' said Tom Rhinelander, an industry 
analyst with Forrester Research, a Boston-based high-tech 
consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Gateway's new Profile computer, which starts at $1,999 and is  
just 3 inches thick, looks like it's missing something from the 
back. Yet crammed against the thin monitor is a 400-megahertz AMD 
microprocessor, 64-megabytes of memory, a 4.3-gigabyte hard drive 
and sockets for attachments. 
</P>
<P>
	A comparably equipped Gateway of the bulkier variety costs  
$1,317. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a nice slim unit. We would recommend it to customers,''  
said salesman Gary Paraschak of the Waytek computer distributor in 
Voorhees, N.J., who was checking out the PC Expo exhibits for 
products to sell to retail stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Saving room ``is a real big issue because office space is  
expensive,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's got a possibility,'' said a more skeptical Catherine  
Miller of Cigna Corp., who advises the big insurance company on 
computer purchases. She was concerned that employees used to 
conventional monitors might have a hard time adjusting to the new 
screens. 
</P>
<P>
	``The visibility is just OK,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Sony's new Vaio Slimtop LCD computer also features a sliver of a  
monitor. But unlike Gateway, Sony packed its vital circuitry into a 
separate box the size of a hard-cover dictionary -- about one-third 
the dimensions of a conventional computer tower. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vaio Slimtop, available in lavendar-gray, sports an  
innovativekeyboard with a dust cover that slides out to convert 
into a palm rest. Prices start at $2,299 for a machine equipped 
with a 400-megahertz Pentium II, and $2,999 for a version with a 
500-megahertz Pentium III. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony officials said the Slimtops, announced earlier this year,  
are aimed at such space-conscious buyers such as Wall Street firms, 
where financial traders' desks typically are crammed with up to six 
monitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Packard Bell NEC, owned by NEC Corp. and Groupe Bull, last week  
rolled out its Z1 desktop, a $2,500 desktop that fits its important 
components into the back of a flat-screen monitor. It also includes 
a wireless keyboard that no longer tethers users to the desktop. At 
the PC Expo show, the company displayed a slim computer designed 
for business use, costing $2,400 and up. 
</P>
<P>
	Like its slim rivals, the Z1 uses many Packard Bell parts that  
were originally made for laptops, enabling the feat of desktop 
miniaturization. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically it is a notebook in desktop clothing,'' said Michael  
DeNeffe, Packard Bell's product manager for laptops.

<HEADLINE> Congress Urged To Negotiate Y2K Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Business groups are appealing to the White  
House and Congress to iron out differences that could doom 
legislation protecting them from crippling lawsuits growing out of 
year 2000 computer problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House reiterated on Wednesday that President Clinton  
would veto the Y2K litigation bills passed by the Senate and the 
House on grounds they go too far in restricting legal rights to 
seek redress for damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers said they would test that veto threat by moving  
quickly to pass a bill and sending it to the president's desk. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are convinced that if such a bill were vetoed, the momentum  
to legislate on this important matter would be lost,'' the Year 
2000 Coalition, a group that includes the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, 
the National Association of Manufacturers and other major business 
groups, wrote House Republican leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	A process that ends in a veto, the coalition said, ``would be  
viewed as a complete failure and would pose substantial risk to the 
American economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bills passed by the House and the Senate would try to head off a  
flood of lawsuits from possible computer breakdowns after Jan. 1, 
2000, by giving companies 90 days to fix computers before lawsuits 
can be filed and encouraging out-of-court mediation. 
</P>
<P>
	The more far-reaching House bill would also limit punitive  
damages in most suits and ensure that defendants be held liable 
only for that share of damages for which they are responsible. The 
Senate bill, somewhat more acceptable to the White House, limits 
damages only for small businesses and does not have the loser-pays 
provisions of the House bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the president is ready to sign a bill that is narrowly  
tailored to address the risks posed by frivolous litigation, 
neither the Senate nor the House bill meets that test and the 
president will veto them,'' White House spokesman Jake Siewert 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said Tuesday the  
House was ready to accept the more moderate Senate bill and send it 
directly to the president. 
</P>
<P>
	House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt charged that Republicans  
were inviting a veto because they are ``more interested in finding 
a political issue to help their Silicon Valley fund raising.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A presidential veto, while it would please the trial lawyers and  
consumer groups who have been strong backers of Clinton, would put 
the president at odds with the high-tech community, another group 
that has provided financial support for the president and Vice 
President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Armey's office said the new plan was to hold a quick  
House-Senate conference on Thursday and take a compromise bill to 
the House floor on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	One purpose of the conference would be to change language in the  
Senate bill inserted by Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., a leading 
opponent of the bill, that would ensure that people are not be 
subject to mortgage loan foreclosure because of Y2K problems. The 
banking industry said that the provision was too broadly written 
and that Y2K could be used as an excuse to avoid obligations.

<HEADLINE> Record Droughts a Problem in South / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- From browning grass on golf courses in Augusta to  
hungry cows in Tennessee and withering crops in North Carolina, the 
second-driest spring in a century has left much of the South 
parched. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia has been the hardest hit by the drought, with some parts  
of the state 11 inches below average rainfall for the year. Farmers 
say they have already lost millions and many communities have 
enacted water restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody wants a nice yard, but the system just can't handle  
it,'' said Max Hicks, director of the Augusta Utilities Department, 
which has imposed a mandatory outdoor watering ban. ``We want to 
make sure there's enough water for inside use before we start 
worrying about sprinkler systems and green grass.'' 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina's Piedmont region endured the driest May on  
record. In eastern Tennessee, where rainfall is nearly 4 inches 
below normal for the year, cattle farmers are being forced to sell 
off stock because grass is dying and the cows don't have enough to 
eat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw stands of grass this spring where 20 to 50 percent ...  
was killed by dry weather last year,'' said Gary Bates, a 
University of Tennessee forage specialist. ``If this dry spell 
continues, pastures dry up and farmers have to feed baled hay to 
their cows in the summer, we could really run into a hay shortage 
and problems this winter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dry spell is a continuation of what many farmers and  
meteorologists dubbed the ``Drought of the Century,'' which began 
last summer and caused $700 million in crop damage in Georgia 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
	The dry weather continued through the winter, when farmers and  
homeowners alike count on heavy rains to build up water levels. 
</P>
<P>
	La Nina, a phenomenon that cools waters in the Pacific Ocean, is  
causing the drying pattern. Its cousin, El Nino, caused by warm 
Pacific waters, brought record rains and floods earlier in the 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Since La Nina has pushed the jet stream to the northwest, most  
of storms have hit the Midwest and Plains states, while the South 
continues to thirst for rain. 
</P>
<P>
	``All we've gotten down here is a couple of glancing blows and  
not the strong fronts we need for heavy rain,'' said Andy Pace, a 
meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Peachtree City. 
</P>
<P>
	Another effect of La Nina is that it makes it more likely for  
tropical systems and hurricanes to develop off the East Coast. That 
would bring the needed rain, but could also bring high winds and 
damage that no one wants. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could be a bad thing, or it could be a good thing,'' Pace  
said. ``The best-case scenario would be if we had a weak tropical 
depression hit with winds of 30 mph.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida has received enough rain recently to lift a statewide  
fireworks ban in time for the July 4 weekend, and the wildfires 
that plagued the state last year have been limited to just 64,000 
acres this year. And in normally arid west Texas, residents are 
praying for the rain to stop after massive flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	But in central Georgia's Hudson County, cotton farmer Terrell  
Hudson says he is burning 7,000 gallons of diesel fuel a week to 
keep his irrigation pumps running -- just to wet the ground enough 
for planting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got cotton fields around here that are just dust,''  
Hudson said. ``We've got three ponds that we've filled up and 
drained twice. I've never done that this soon before.''

<HEADLINE> Thompson Finally in Hall of Fame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- John Thompson did more than win basketball  
games at Georgetown. 
</P>
<P>
	Some would say that's why he belongs in the Hall of Fame.  
Others, including Thompson, say that's what kept him out for so 
long. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll probably be remembered for all the things that kept me  
out of the Hall of Fame, ironically, more than for the things that 
got me into it,'' Thompson said Wednesday after he and four others 
were elected in the Class of '99. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-seven years ago, Thompson inherited a program with a 3-23  
record and turned it into a national powerhouse. His Hoyas teams 
went 596-239, made the NCAA tournament 14 straight times, played in 
three Final Fours and won the national championship in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson also coached the 1988 U.S. Olympic men's team that won  
a bronze medal and was an assistant on the 1976 team that won the 
gold. Among the players he sent to the NBA were Patrick Ewing, 
Alonzo Mourning and Dikembe Mutombo. 
</P>
<P>
	But Thompson was also outspoken on many issues, particularly the  
treatment of minority players. In January 1989, he walked off the 
court before a home game to protest NCAA Proposition 42, which 
restricted criteria under which athletes could receive 
scholarships. The legislation was later modified. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson said such stands hurt his cause with Hall of Fame  
voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't win the popular vote easily, and I'd never give my  
life towards trying to do that,'' he said. ``I don't think I've 
ever taken a position on anything for the sake of being contrary. 
I've taken positions I believe to be correct. I don't think I'd win 
many elections if I ran for public office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson had been nominated for the Hall of Fame three times  
before, and he said it hurt each time he wasn't elected. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is something that I wanted, make no bones about it,'' he  
said. ``I feel very much relieved now that it has happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson stunned college basketball in January when he resigned  
in midseason for personal reasons related to his marriage. His name 
arises for various NBA jobs and he hints he might soon return to 
coaching. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I stopped I did not want to stop,'' he said. ``I could  
not do what it is I wanted to do. But those things being resolved, 
after that happens, you evaluate what you're going to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``Remember that famous quote -- that I am resigning, not  
retiring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson played in college at Providence and was the Celtics'  
backup center for Bill Russell on the 1965 and 1966 NBA 
championship teams. He thanked everyone for his election -- from the 
teacher who left him in tears because she made him repeat the sixth 
grade to longtime assistant and former player Craig Esherick, who 
succeeded Thompson in January. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was a player here, you could count on one hand the  
number of black coaches in the country,'' Esherick said. ``There 
were few black assistants, referees and announcers. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Chief Expects 24 Hour Trades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Investors clamoring for extended trading hours  
will soon get that and a whole lot more. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq chief Frank Zarb has a vision of what the next few years  
will bring: a global stock market that is digital and open 24 
hours, letting people make trades instantly anywhere from their 
computers, cellphones and pagers. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech Wednesday at the National Press Club, Zarb --  
chairman of the National Association of Securities Dealers, which 
operates the electronic Nasdaq Stock Market -- said after-hours 
trading will happen because investors want it. ... People want to 
be able to trade their personal stock portfolios at a time 
convenient to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the government's top securities regulator urged caution,  
warning investors that the new after-hours markets will be thinner 
and potentially more volatile than traditional daytime ones, at 
least for a while. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's terribly important that the brokerage firms, the (stock)  
exchanges and the markets educate investors about what risks there 
are in after-hours trading,'' Arthur Levitt, chairman of the 
Securities and Exchange Commission, said at a ``town meeting'' in 
Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt said it's likely that some of the new electronic  
communications networks, known as ECNs, will begin after-hours 
stock trading in several months, perhaps by summer's end. However, 
he suggested that most of the market likely will follow the New 
York Stock Exchange, which recently said it wouldn't extend its 
hours until the second half of next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the NYSE expands its hours it wants first to ensure there  
are no glitches with the Year 2000 computer bug and the planned 
switch to reporting stock prices in decimals instead of fractions. 
The go-slow decision came a week after Nasdaq voted to begin 
extending its hours into the evening as soon as this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC, which is expected to eventually approve proposals for  
extended trading hours, announced Wednesday it was convening a 
financial industry ``summit'' on the issue with Zarb's securities 
dealers' group and the NYSE. The June 30 meeting will be closed to 
the public and the press. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ideally, extended hours shouldn't be implemented piecemeal by  
exchanges or the new electronic communications networks that trade 
stocks,'' Zarb urged in his speech. ``Investors would be best 
served if the industry could move to new hours in a coordinated 
way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zarb also said he and fellow NASD officials are examining  
several possible structural changes to help Nasdaq compete in the 
market of the future. 
</P>
<P>
	The NASD is considering lopping off its regulatory division and  
merging it with the NYSE's for both quality and financial reasons. 
Zarb also noted that Nasdaq was considering going public by selling 
stock in itself to key investment firms and possibly later to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq chief's comments come at a time when the global  
financial markets are expanding at a dizzying pace. Just last week, 
Zarb announced plans to establish a trading exchange similar to 
Nasdaq's in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq also has set up a joint Web site with Hong Kong's stock  
exchange that will allow U.S. investors to trade in Hong Kong 
securities, has signed a similar deal with the Australian Stock 
Exchange, and is looking into new alliances in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The global expansion by the world's second-largest stock market  
has sharpened its competition with the largest, the NYSE, which 
uses a traditional trading floor. Nasdaq also recently took over 
the American Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The two competing exchanges may be able to help each other if  
they merged their regulatory operations, Zarb said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A high-tech, independent single regulator, jointly owned by  
the markets, with advanced electronic surveillance could be better 
for investors, markets and the securities industry,'' he said. 
``This could lessen costs and increase depth of regulation, as well 
as eliminate potential conflicts of interest between regulators and 
the stock markets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the NYSE had no immediate comment on the idea.  
</P>
<P>
	Looking a few years ahead, Zarb said ``trading floors and paper,  
for the most part, will be rendered obsolete by competition and 
technology. ... This 21st-century stock market will be ... computer 
screen-based, technology-driven and open to all -- all because 
people will have access to information that they want to act on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People will be able to get instant stock quotes and trades  
anytime day or night, he said, using computers, cellphones, pagers 
and hand-held organizers. They'll even be able to get personalized 
reports on the performance of their investments from their car 
radios and digital TVs at home.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Pietro Deiro Jr., an accordion player and music  
publisher, died Saturday. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Deiro, who was known as Lee, gave no concerts, he was  
influential in the accordion world. His publishing house, Pietro 
Deiro Publications, had a catalog of almost 10,000 works, including 
educational pieces, music in different national styles and serious 
concert works by American composers. He helped give the accordion a

<P>
	Linder's coverage of Tropical Storm Agnes in 1972 and a 12-part  
retrospective the following year earned him the Philadelphia Press 
Association award for the best news story. In 1986, Linder was the 
first recipient of the AP News Staffer of the Year award of the 
Pennsylvania Associated Press Managing Editors. 
</P>
<P>
	Before joining the AP in 1945, Linder worked for International

<HEADLINE> Duval: Ryder Cup Isn't Everything  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARRISON, N.Y. (AP) -- David Duval does not think the Ryder Cup  
between the United States and Europe has become golf's No. 1 event. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, while certain to play in the event Sept. 24-26 at The  
Country Club in Brookline, Mass., the world's top-ranked player 
said making the American Ryder Cup team was not among his major 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see it as the end-all, be-all thing in golf that a lot  
of other people seem to view it as,'' he said Wednesday after 
competing in a pro-am the day before the Buick Classic begins at 
the Westchester Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval said he has heard some European players characterize the  
Ryder Cup as the biggest event in golf. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't see it that way,'' Duval said. ``If I had to  
choose between a U.S. Open and a Ryder Cup, I mean there is not 
much of a choice for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval said he views the Ryder Cup ``more as an exhibition.''  
</P>
<P>
	``I think that was the intended nature when it was started and I  
think it has gotten a little bigger and a little more influenced by 
other things than golf,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval has never played in a Ryder Cup, but he is the runaway  
points leader to qualify for the American team this year. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 3 on the points list is Payne Stewart, the new U.S. Open  
champion, who said that if any of his teammates were not excited 
about playing in a Ryder Cup, he will shake them by the throat to 
get them fired up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Better not put his hands around my throat,'' Duval said.  
</P>
<P>
	Duval took pains, however, to say he doesn't mean he won't  
prepare hard for the matches and try his best. 
</P>
<P>
	``But ... I am not going to be bedridden for a month if we get  
beat,'' he said. ``It is not going to destroy me or something.''

<HEADLINE> Lopez Withdraws Due to Knee Surgery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Nancy Lopez, on crutches and in tears,  
withdrew from the LPGA Championship on Wednesday and said she will 
have surgery to remove torn cartilage from her right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to be in pain,'' Lopez said, trying to force her  
charming smile through the tears. ``I'd rather go home and retire. 
The way my knees have been bothering me, it's kind of a relief 
knowing something was wrong and we can fix it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lopez has a degenerative tear of the medial meniscus. She will  
have arthroscopic surgery Thursday morning at the Morgan Kalman 
Clinic in Wilmington and is expected to be off the LPGA Tour for 
about one month. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to get it right,'' she said. ``I'm a baby when it  
comes to pain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her 48 victories and incomparable charisma have made Lopez the  
most popular player in women's golf over the past two decades. But 
she has been hurting for the past several months, from arthritis in 
her left knee and then from overworking her right knee to 
compensate for the pain. 
</P>
<P>
	She wore a brace on her left knee in the U.S. Women's Open, in  
which she missed the cut. Swinging a club was not a problem, but 
Lopez said she has had a hard time walking and bending over to read 
putts. 
</P>
<P>
	She realized something was amiss Monday morning in Chicago  
during an outing for the American Stroke Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to get out of bed, and I couldn't walk,'' she said.  
``Every time I sat down, it got worse. I got real nauseous real 
quick, because it scared me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Having to withdraw from the LPGA Championship was particularly  
hard because Lopez is a three-time champion. Her first major 
championship was among five straight victories in her amazing 
rookie season of 1978, when she won nine times. 
</P>
<P>
	She has had other injuries in her career, but nothing this  
serious. Lopez tore ligaments in her hand during the Women's 
British Open her rookie year, when an 8-iron got caught on a tree 
stump. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ended up winning the tournament,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	She also has had back problems, and at first thought that might  
what was wrong this time. 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband, former Cincinnati Reds manager Ray Knight, believes  
the right knee injury took root during the British Open two years 
ago when Lopez slipped on a wet piece of wood. All Lopez knows is 
that it will be fixed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is God's way of saying you need to take care of yourself  
first,'' Lopez said. ``We can fix it. It's not anything major. 
Besides being disappointed, I'm fine.''

<HEADLINE> Jury: Death in Sledgehammer Slaying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WATERBURY, Conn. (AP) -- A jury today recommended a death  
sentence for a man who confessed to killing a 13-year-old neighbor 
with a sledgehammer because he wanted to know what it felt like to 
kill. 
</P>
<P>
	Todd Rizzo, 20, had pleaded guilty to the Sept. 30, 1997 slaying  
of Stanley Edwards. He confessed to luring the boy into his yard 
under the guise of hunting snakes and hitting him 13 times with a 
3-pound sledgehammer. He told police he wanted to see what it felt 
like to kill someone. 
</P>
<P>
	Police had said Rizzo told them he had an intense interest in  
serial killers, especially Jeffrey Dahmer, who cut up and ate some 
of his victims. 
</P>
<P>
	The recommendation, which must be formally approved by Judge  
William Holden, came during the fourth day of deliberations.

<HEADLINE> Former AP Newsman Linder Dies at 77 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Lee Linder, a brash, tireless reporter who  
covered half a century of news for The Associated Press, including 
Kent State, Three Mile Island and the MOVE bombing, died of cancer 
Wednesday. He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever there was a breaking story, he was the first to come  
to mind. He couldn't be exhausted, even well into his 60s,'' said 
George Zucker, former AP chief of bureau for Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	A man other reporters called a workaholic, Linder covered major  
stories in Pennsylvania and elsewhere, from post-World War II 
celebrations to the riot at Kent State in Ohio in 1970 to the 
aftermath of the Three Mile Island nuclear disaster in Middletown 
in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Before retiring in 1995, Linder was at the bombing of the  
radical MOVE compound in 1985 and dictated the obituary of 
Philadelphia Mayor Frank Rizzo from an Atlantic City, N.J., phone 
booth while on vacation in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporters around the city recalled how well-known the slight but  
commanding man was among Philadelphia's politicians. One time when 
Rizzo called a press conference, he looked out over the crowd of 
reporters and said: ``I guess this must be an important press 
conference. Lee Linder of The Associated Press is here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If the AP was at any event, you could almost bank on it being  
Lee Linder,'' said Joseph A. Slobodzian, a Philadelphia Inquirer 
reporter for the past 26 years. ``He was AP's public face in 
Philadelphia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Linder's news sources were legendary, earning him exclusives  
that won national and international display. They included a 1966 
exclusive interview with atomic spy Harry Gold, who evaded other 
reporters upon his prison release and met with Linder at a motel. 
</P>
<P>
	He also earned praise in 1967 when he got a Glassboro, N.J.,  
accountant to turn his home into a temporary AP bureau when 
President Lyndon Johnson and Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin held an 
impromptu summit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was sent out to scout the home of the college president,  
Hollybush, and lucked out at the home of an accountant that lived 
across the street. He turned over his home to AP. For the next 24 
hours, that was the focus of the world,'' Linder said when he 
retired in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Linder's coverage of Tropical Storm Agnes in 1972 and a 12-part  
retrospective the following year earned him the Philadelphia Press 
Association award for the best news story. In 1986, Linder was the 
first recipient of the AP News Staffer of the Year award of the 
Pennsylvania Associated Press Managing Editors. 
</P>
<P>
	Linder was born in Philadelphia and graduated in 1943 from  
Temple University, where he was editor of the campus newspaper. 
Before joining the AP in 1945, Linder worked for International News 
Service in Philadelphia and Detroit, United Press in Cleveland and 
the Washington Star. 
</P>
<P>
	Linder also was active in many Jewish organizations.  
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his wife, Thelma Elster, two daughters and six  
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral services are scheduled for Thursday at the Oxford Circle  
Jewish Community Center-Brith Israel. Burial will follow at the 
Roosevelt Memorial Park in Trevose.

<HEADLINE> John Daly Contrite After Outburst  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANLIUS, N.Y. (AP) -- John Daly has a simple wish for his  
complicated life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to try and stay out of trouble,'' golf's longest  
hitter said. ``That would be nice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daly's was in trouble again over the weekend at the U.S. Open.  
He finished last and made no secret of his unhappiness. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my last U.S. Open -- ever,'' Daly said as he walked to  
his car after an 83 on Sunday. ``I've had it with the USGA and the 
way they run their tournaments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, he apologized during an appearance at a charity  
event in suburban Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what happened. It was just the heat of the  
moment, coming off a bad round,'' Daly said during a skins game 
competition. ``I was just upset at my performance. I made some 
stupid comments. It doesn't get you popularity what I said the 
other day, but I sure hope the USGA will forgive me for it. It was 
stupid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his outburst, Daly said he hadn't ruled out playing in  
next year's Open at Pebble Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	``My game I don't feel has the patience maybe for the U.S.  
Open,'' he said. ``But if the fans want me to play at Pebble, it 
will give me a bigger reason to play because I don't think it'll be 
a tournament that I'll go in thinking I can win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daly, who has battled alcoholism and a gambling problem, shot a  
first-round 68 last Thursday and was one shot off the U.S. Open 
lead. That prompted him to entertain the media with wit and humor 
</P>
<P>
	The charm wore off after Saturday's third round when Daly carded  
an 11-over 81 -- his second straight Open collapse. Last year at The 
Olympic Club, Daly began with a 69, only to shoot 75, 75 and 78 to 
finish in a tie for 53rd. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly declined to talk to the media after his third-round  
disaster at Pinehurst No. 2, making a quick stop in the locker room 
and speeding off in his car. 
</P>
<P>
	The frustration peaked at No. 8 on Sunday and left Daly piqued.  
After a 340-yard drive on the par-4, 485-yard hole, Daly's second 
shot landed to the left of the green in one of the course's dreaded 
swales. He tried twice to putt the ball close to the flag, only to 
have it stop short and roll back toward his feet both times. 
</P>
<P>
	With the ball still rolling after his fourth shot, Daly took a  
swipe and sent it rocketing over the green. That counted as another 
stroke, plus a two-shot penalty. He finally put the ball on the 
green with his eighth shot, then three-putted for an 11. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the culmination of a dismal streak that Daly would rather  
forget. In his last nine starts on Tour, he has missed the cut 
three times, withdrawn three times, and his best finish is a tie 
for 51st. 
</P>
<P>
	``Golf has been very frustrating this year,'' he said. ``It was  
not just the Open. I think it was nine weeks ready to explode. The 
good news is, it's about golf right now. I'm still struggling day 
to day, but at least I know the most worries are still sobriety and 
then golf. It's not all the other stuff that I usually go through. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's actually more of a struggle now than it was when I was  
drinking,'' he said. ``I'm learning how to live again. I'm learning 
actually how to get a feel for the game again.''

<HEADLINE> Mag's Navy Yard Party Torpedoed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Plans to christen Talk magazine during a gala at  
the Brooklyn Navy Yard were torpedoed after the Giuliani 
administration realized that the maiden cover of the publication 
might feature Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine's owners, Miramax Films and Hearst Magazines, had  
asked to use the site for an Aug. 2 party to celebrate the debut of 
the new magazine edited by former New Yorker and Vanity Fair editor 
Tina Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never do parties at the Brooklyn Navy Yard,'' Deputy Mayor  
Randy Levine said Tuesday. ``There's never been a party there. We 
said we would explore it. That's all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plan was to have fireworks, water-spouting fire boats and a  
guest list chockablock with A-list stars from the entertainment, 
publishing and political worlds, possibly including Mrs. Clinton 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
	Requests for use of the city-owned Navy Yard were denied  
primarily because the industrial area is not suited for such 
frivolity, Levine said. But he admitted that the involvement of 
Mrs. Clinton, who could find herself facing Mayor Rudolph Giuliani 
in next year's Senate race, also played a part. 
</P>
<P>
	``A week ago, we heard they were going to put Mrs. Clinton on  
the cover, and we thought that would lead to an event possibly 
becoming politicized,'' Levine said. ``There was the possibility 
that this thing would turn into a circus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miramax says no decision had been made about who would be on  
Talk's inaugural cover. The New York Post reported recently that 
Mrs. Clinton has posed for a photo for the prospective cover. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether a new site for the party had been chosen, Ms.  
Brown quipped, ``I was wondering whether Gracie Mansion would be 
available.'' That's the mayor's home. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy Yard closed as a shipyard in 1966. It is now home to  
about 200 businesses. Among the projects in the planning stages for 
the site is a high-tech movie studio partially backed by Miramax 
Films. 
</P>
<P>
	It isn't the first time the Giuliani administration has tussled  
with a magazine. In 1997, the city yanked ads from city buses that 
said New York magazine was ``Possibly the only good thing in New 
York Rudy hasn't taken credit for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	City lawyers cited a state law preventing people from having  
their names or faces in ads without their permission. The magazine 
sued, saying the city and the Metropolitan Transit Authority had 
violated its right to free speech. The courts sided with the 
magazine.

<HEADLINE> V-Chip Education Campaign Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal officials, advocacy groups and  
industry leaders are joining together to teach families and 
educators how to use v-chips, as manufacturers near their first 
deadline to install the technology in new television sets. 
</P>
<P>
	Two private groups were launching a national education campaign  
today to promote the use of v-chips and explain the electronically 
coded TV ratings system that goes with it. While most television 
and cable networks use letter notations or age-based ratings to 
flag violence or sexual situations, viewers don't always understand 
what the symbols signify, said Kathryn Montgomery, president of the 
Center for Media Education. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest problem is that the ratings icons are visible on  
the show, but there is not enough education on what they mean,'' 
Montgomery said. Her group, along with the Kaiser Family 
Foundation, has created a guide that explains the TV ratings system 
and how to use the v-chip. The guide also provides a form to offer 
feedback to the TV Parental Guidelines Monitoring Board. 
</P>
<P>
	V-chips are intended to give viewers, primarily parents, the  
option of blocking shows they find objectionable. A 1996 
telecommunications law requires that all new TV sets 13 inches and 
larger must be equipped with the v-chip by Jan. 1, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the FCC imposed a July 1 deadline on manufacturers to  
install the technology in at least half their new sets. According 
to FCC Commissioner Gloria Tristani, nearly all of them have met 
the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Other challenges remain, Tristani said. The commission is now  
working with the industry to make sure that the ratings are being 
transmitted so the v-chips will have something to read, she said. 
Also, parents need to be informed that the v-chip is available to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until we educate parents about the v-chip, they can't use it  
to make educated choices for their children,'' Tristani said in 
remarks prepared for delivery today. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the education effort, the National Association of  
Broadcasters and National Cable Television Association plan to 
produce and distribute public service announcements that would 
direct parents to the informational materials. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association, the U.S.  
Conference of Mayors and teachers' unions also have agreed to help 
promote the materials. 
</P>
<P>
	The guide answers such questions as whether consumers need to  
buy a new television to get a v-chip (consumers can purchase a 
set-top box to use on old TV sets that works the same way), whether 
violence or sexual content will be blocked from news shows (news is 
exempt from the ratings), and how the ratings are displayed (in the 
upper left-hand corner of the screen during the first 15 seconds of 
a show). 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Free copies of the guide are available by calling  
1-877-2-VCHIP-TV or on the Internet at http://www.vchipeducation.org.

<HEADLINE> Athletics Extend Howe's Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- The Oakland Athletics extended manager  
Art Howe's contract through the 2000 season before Wednesday 
night's game against the Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Howe had signed a one-year contract extension with an option for  
a second season on Oct. 7, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Howe has been the A's manager since 1996. The team started  
Wednesday night with a 36-34 record and in second place in the AL 
West. The A's are three games behind the Rangers, despite having 
one of the lowest payrolls in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are extremely pleased with the progress the major league  
club has shown under Art's leadership,'' A's general manager Billy 
Beane said. ``Our success is a credit to Art, his coaches and the 
players. This is well deserved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 52-year-old Howe entered Wednesday with a record of 253-303  
in his three-plus seasons with Oakland, leaving him behind only 
Tony La Russa (798 victories) and Dick Williams (288) in Oakland 
history.

<HEADLINE> Board of Trade Studies Europe Tie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- At the Chicago Board of Trade this week, the hot  
topic isn't grain and soybeans but the future of the world's 
largest futures exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	In a dramatic turnaround signaling increasing alarm about an  
onslaught of competitors, the exchange's chairman has endorsed an 
alliance with rival Eurex, an all-electronic exchange based in 
Frankfurt, as the best way to ensure survival. 
</P>
<P>
	But no one is taking bets on whether some 2,100 members will  
agree with that assessment. They hold a pivotal vote Thursday that 
could decide the exchange's course and determine the fate of 
150,000 industry-related jobs in the Chicago area. 
</P>
<P>
	``The exchange put on a very strong presentation last week in  
favor of the alliance that has helped people who were wavering 
consider whether this is the best alternative for the membership,'' 
said Mark Cermak, president of futures trading at O'Connor &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``Combining the two entities can only help us right now, but  
where it ultimately leads us, I don't think anybody knows,'' he 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Board of Trade, the world's largest open outcry exchange,  
business has been conducted for 151 years by yelling and gesturing 
to set forward prices for everything from corn and wheat to U.S. 
Treasury bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	But the hallowed institution has been in the grips of an  
identity crisis for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Internet and computer-based technology revolutionize  
industry, investors are finding it easier and cheaper to trade 
futures and options without ever stepping foot in an exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	New competitors have moved swiftly to capitalize on the trend,  
but American exchanges have struggled with what to do with physical 
property -- and jobs -- that no longer seem relevant. Some members 
have shown a distrust of new technology, resulting in plummeting 
prices for seats on exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
	Board of Trade Chairman David Brennan narrowly defeated Patrick  
Arbor in December after Brennan spoke out against the alliance. But 
after a power struggle within the leadership ranks early this 
spring that left Brennan weakened, he reversed course. 
</P>
<P>
	``The renewed CBOT-Eurex alliance is the right business decision  
that will allow us to meet and beat all competition,'' he wrote to 
members in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, he urged approval and said a decision to ultimately  
abandon the exchange's own electronic trading platform, known as 
Project A, would save money. 
</P>
<P>
	A CBOT-Eurex combination that will allow the two to cross-trade  
their contracts electronically will cost $50 million over the next 
18 months, but developing a new screen-based system alone would 
cost far more, Brennan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eurex is a strong partner with proven technology -- even  
stronger now than four months ago -- and we can be confident from 
here on that this is the best business initiative for our 
exchange,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The exchange also is reconsidering becoming a for-profit venture  
to provide cash and governance to allow for quicker decisions on 
change to meet future challenges.

<HEADLINE> Arson Investigated in Belmont Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELMONT, N.Y. (AP) -- A fire at Belmont Park that killed three  
thoroughbreds may have been deliberately set, fire investigators 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Saudo, an investigator with the Nassau County fire  
marshal's office, said Tuesday night's fire in a backstretch barn 
was being investigated as a possible arson. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the horses, Clear to Launch and Graceful Finish, were so  
badly injured they had to be euthanized immediately Tuesday night. 
A third horse, Surely Handsome, was euthanized Wednesday afternoon. 
All three were trained by J.J. Toner. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators interviewed workers and used trained dogs to sift  
through charred debris in the barn. The fire started in a vacant 
area of the barn and spread rapidly. Saudo said the dogs detected 
the presence of flammable liquids, but he cautioned that trainers 
often use alcohol products in treating horses. 
</P>
<P>
	He said samples were taken to the Nassau County Police crime  
lab. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know. It could have been a cigarette or something,''  
NYRA fire marshal Kenny Kopp said Tuesday night. Smoking is 
prohibited inside the stables. 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer John Campo Jr. said he was watching a softball game  
nearby when he saw smoke. 
</P>
<P>
	``The smoke was so thick when I got there,'' Campo said  
Wednesday. ``I got one horse out and handed him to someone. But 
when I went back in, I couldn't get another horse out. I couldn't 
breathe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1986, a barn fire at Belmont Park killed 45 thoroughbreds, 36  
of which were trained by his father. A cause was never determined, 
although a heat lamp in a stall where hay was piled was considered 
a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel horrible,'' the younger Campo said Wednesday. ``I  
wouldn't wish the loss of a horse on my worst enemy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fire occurred in a receiving barn for horses not usually  
stabled at the track. There were fewer horses than usual because 
there was no racing Monday or Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a terrible tragedy, but we are grateful the sprinkler  
system and fire alarm worked perfectly, thus preventing any further 
loss,'' New York Racing Association president Terry Meyocks said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,000 horses are kept in 64 barns at the sprawling  
430-acre complex. 
</P>
<P>
	Surely Handsome, a 3-year-old colt, was owned by Caesar Kimmel  
and Ronald Nicholson. He was winless in five lifetime starts. 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 15, 1996, What an Evening, a 3-year-old colt, was killed  
in a Belmont stable fire that he started when he reared and toppled 
a heat lamp which set some hay on fire.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Jelena Dokic's agent is already headed  
to the bank following the 16-year-old Australian's upset of 
top-ranked Martina Hingis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, you can't choose a better place to beat a No. 1  
player than at a Grand Slam,'' said her Washington-based agent, 
Ivan Brixi. 
</P>
<P>
	What's the upset worth? ``To put a dollar and cents worth on it,  
I don't think you can. It'd be ridiculous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Dokic and her parents -- Damir and Liliana -- had been  
selective about linking their daughter to sponsorship deals and had 
turned down proposals from hotels, restaurant chains, soft drinks 
and a loan institution. 
</P>
<P>
	``With somebody like her, a top player and a top prospect, you  
have to look at the image, the fit,'' Brixi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dokic was mobbed by photographers and autograph seekers when she  
took the court Wednesday to play doubles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quite a few people obviously knew who I was, it was quite a  
bit different than a few days ago,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what she'd done to relax after the upset, she replied,  
``I'm not relaxing, I'm not finished yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	DAD POWER:@ Contrary to a match earlier this month, Dokic's  
father, Damir, was reserved and almost stoic during her victory 
Monday against Hingis. 
</P>
<P>
	In a tournament in Birmingham, Ala., a few weeks ago, he was  
ejected for cheering too loudly and abusing officials. Outside the 
tennis grounds he was arrested for blocking traffic and jumping on 
a car hood. 
</P>
<P>
	His daughter's win didn't surprise him at all.  
</P>
<P>
	``I told Jelena all along she could beat Martina,'' he said.  
``In fact, I was so relaxed I was in bed by nine the night before. 
I left Jelena watching TV, which was probably the best 
preparation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even he doesn't know how high she can move up in the rankings.  
</P>
<P>
	``She's very ambitious but at the moment we don't know how good  
she is,'' he said. ``I don't want to add to that right now because 
I don't want to put extra pressure on her.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	OTHER STUNNERS:@ Hingis was only the third top-seeded woman at  
Wimbledon to lose her opening match, joining Steffi Graf (1994) and 
Margaret Court (1962). Three other shockers at Wimbledon also come 
to mind. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1967, Spain's Manuel Santana was the top seed and defending  
champion, but lost in the first round to America's Charlie 
Pasarell. In '87, Boris Becker, after winning consecutive titles in 
'85 and '86, was ousted in the second round by Australian Peter 
Doohan. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there was 15-year-old Capriati in 1991, becoming the  
youngest semifinalist at Wimbledon by dethroning defending champion 
Martina Navratilova. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	OH DANNY BOY:@ Britain's Danny Sapsford, ranked 571st in the  
world, has said he'll retire after Wimbledon. He probably won't 
have to wait long. He's due to meet top-ranked Pete Sampras in the 
third round. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	IN SUPPORT:@ Venus Williams and Jennifer Capriati know what  
Hingis is going through. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has done better than me,'' Williams said after beating  
Elena Tatarkova 6-3, 6-4 in the second round on Wednesday. ``She 
has been doing something right. ... I understand when you have a 
loss like that, I totally sympathize.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Capriati, a second-round loser on Wednesday to Seda Noorlander  
6-1, 6-3, was also staunch in defense of Hingis. 
</P>
<P>
	``The press makes it out to be a crisis,'' she said. ``It's like  
when they're on top and everything is great, but as soon as there's 
one little thing ... (the press) like vultures can't wait to knock 
them down.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	ODDS AND ENDS:@ Hingis withdrew from doubles late Tuesday, a  
Wimbledon statement saying only she had a ``recurring medical 
problem.'' The WTA Tour Wednesday said she had a heel problem. ... 
A ticket to the first men's final in 1877 cost eight cents. Today, 
it's $96 ... Wimbledon officials expect to sell nearly 60,000 
pounds of strawberries drenched in 1,850 gallons of cream. They'll 
be washed down with 12,500 bottles of champagne and 285,000 cups of 
tea.

<HEADLINE> Woman Sues Tab Over Gifford Affair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A flight attendant whose affair with sportscaster  
Frank Gifford exploded into tabloid fireworks has filed a $10 
million federal lawsuit against a Canadian corporation that 
publishes the weekly Globe. 
</P>
<P>
	Suzen Johnson, 48, said the Globe choreographed the scandal to  
boost profits and pressured her into seducing Gifford in 1997. Her 
suit alleges false imprisonment, negligence and slander. 
</P>
<P>
	In the complaint filed in Miami federal court Tuesday, Johnson  
said she told the Globe that she and Gifford never had sex, just a 
flirtatious relationship. Gifford is married to TV talk show host 
Kathie Lee Gifford. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said Globe news editor Candace Trunzo told her that the  
paper only wanted to write about the couple's platonic 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said she signed an agreement with the tabloid in March  
1997 in which Globe officials offered $25,000 for the Gifford 
story, and an additional $25,000 for a photo of them together. 
</P>
<P>
	The tabloid paid for Johnson's two-bedroom hotel suite in New  
York City, but Trunzo never mentioned the plan to wire the room to 
record their conversations, the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson claimed the paper forced her into hiding for five weeks  
to avoid media attention from the scandal and forced her to sign a 
confidentiality agreement. She said the only person she was allowed 
to contact during that time was her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	A Globe spokesman, who has not seen the suit, dismissed the  
allegations. The tabloid has had legal wrangling with competitor 
The National Enquirer over the tryst and the handling of Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of the documentary evidence that has been introduced in  
all the other litigation has proven that she is a pathological 
liar,'' Michael Kahane told The Miami Herald in today's editions. 
``I'm sure after I review this complaint we will again prove that 
she's a pathological liar.''

<HEADLINE> Long-Distance Access Fees Falling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Long-distance companies will see reductions in  
the access charges they pay local phone companies to connect calls 
beginning on July 1, after a federal court decided to temporarily 
set aside its ruling that the way the fees were calculated wasn't 
adequately explained. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia last  
month ordered the Federal Communications Commission to review part 
of a 1997 decision that resulted in lower phone bills for millions 
of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said the FCC did not adequately explain certain  
changes in a complex formula that affects the access payments that 
long-distance companies pay local phone companies to connect calls. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Tuesday, the court granted the FCC's motion to suspend  
the order, allowing the charge reductions to go into effect while 
the commission reviews its rationale for making changes to the 
so-called ``X Factor.'' Expressed as a percentage, the factor aims 
at ensuring that as a local phone company's productivity improves, 
the company would receive less from these access payments. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC said the reductions in access charges on July 1 could  
translate into big savings for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``If long distance companies pass these savings along to their  
customers, consumers will see a half billion dollars in long 
distance savings,'' FCC Chairman Bill Kennard said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997 the FCC made some adjustments that caused the access  
fees to be reduced by more than $1 billion.

<HEADLINE> Quayle Not Nostalgic About the '60s </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Vice President Dan Quayle grew up in  
the 1960s but says he doesn't have the nostalgia for that decade 
that many baby boomers have. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many people in very powerful positions have a great deal of  
nostalgia for that,'' he said in a phone interview Wednesday. 
``When I was living it, I enjoyed it, but I'm not so sure that it 
was good for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his new book, ``Worth Fighting For,'' the Republican  
presidential candidate expands his attack on TV's Murphy Brown to 
include the decade of the 1960s and its ``free drugs, free love, 
free lunch and freedom from responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle casts himself as the ``standard-bearer'' for those of all  
ages who embrace the values of the World War II generation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a product of the '60s,'' Quayle said. ``The civil rights  
movement was great. But there was a lot of tragedy, the 
assassinations, the race riots, the Vietnam issue was a no-win 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle said the drug culture was ``just coming in when I was  
leaving college.'' After Quayle graduated from DePauw University in 
Indiana, he went into the National Guard and law school, got 
married and started a family. 
</P>
<P>
	In the book, he attacks the liberal values of the 1960s and an  
``opinion elite'' of baby boomers in the media, universities and 
entertainment business who grew up during the decade and now are in 
positions of influence. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to pay a price for the excesses of the crowd that  
preached free drugs, free love, free lunch and freedom from 
responsibility,'' Quayle writes. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic  
front-runner for president, have ``embraced those who, since the 
1960s, have ceaselessly pounded away at honor, duty, country and 
the rule of law,'' he writes. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle, who has been in single digits in early polls on  
presidential hopefuls, calls the next election a chance to ``reset 
our moral compass.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He uses the book to outline his plans for a 30 percent,  
across-the-board tax cut, his anti-abortion stance, support for 
term limits and protection of the elderly from any benefit cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle writes there are ``deep, if not irreconcilable  
differences between left and right on the issue of the country's 
core values.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Murphy Brown speech I gave in 1992 was notable because it  
clearly demonstrated that the divide existed,'' he writes. Murphy 
Brown, a TV journalist portrayed by actress Candice Bergen, gave 
birth out of wedlock in the series. Quayle criticized the use of an 
out-of-wedlock birth as a plot in a situation comedy. 
</P>
<P>
	He decries the ``new aristocracy'' of the ``elite news media,  
the Hollywood crowd, the tenured faculty of elite institutions of 
higher education, the federal judiciary and the radical feminist 
movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Their numbers are small, but their influence is staggering,''  
Quayle writes. 
</P>
<P>
	He wrote that Gore has praised the television series ``Ellen,''  
for ``in his word, 'forcing' Americans to view a positive portrayal 
of a lesbian relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Quayle has declined comment on actress Ellen DeGeneres'  
gay sexual orientation, he cites Gore's comment as evidence of the 
influence wielded by the ``opinion elite.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While calling the civil rights movement of the 1960s a ``noble  
effort,'' Quayle adds it was soon overshadowed by ``excesses wholly 
unrelated to the struggle for civil rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The drug use of the '60s was ``the wedge that pried open the  
country to the routine use of drugs.'' And ``the rejection of 
traditional sexual morality ... robbed an army of children of the 
chance to live in two-parent households ... even as it unleashed a 
plague of sexually transmitted diseases from herpes to AIDS to 
hepatitis B.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The best way to counter the erosion of American values, Quayle  
writes, is to use the presidential ``bully pulpit'' and appoint 
``cultural critics of ability and intellect'' to key positions such 
as education secretary and the chairs of the national humanities 
and arts endowments.

<HEADLINE> Senators Oppose IMF Gold Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A plan by the International Monetary Fund to  
sell gold to finance debt relief for poor countries would hurt many 
of these nations and the U.S. gold industry, two senators said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jesse Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations  
Committee, and Sen. Chuck Hagel, chairman of the subcommittee on 
international economic policy, said they have joined a bipartisan 
group to oppose the gold sales, which require congressional 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Treasury Secretary-designate Larry Summers, the  
senators said, ``We are unalterably persuaded that selling IMF gold 
reserves would adversely affect the very countries the 
administration intends to assist and further damage the U.S. 
domestic gold industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition also came from lawmakers representing gold mining  
states. ``It ain't going to happen,'' predicted Sen. Richard Bryan, 
D-Nev. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms, R-N.C., and Hagel, R-Neb., said that in the past month,  
since Britain announced it was selling a portion of its gold 
reserves, the price of the gold has plunged to a 20-year low of 
$258 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
	They said they were concerned that the United States, the second  
largest producer of gold after South Africa, would lose jobs and 
companies would go bankrupt if the prices continue to fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms and Hagel said 36 of the 41 nations intended to benefit  
from the IMF gold sales are gold producers and ``if sales further 
depress gold prices, it is questionable that benefits from debt 
relief would outweigh the harm done by falling prices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of the world's main industrial nations meeting last week  
in Cologne, Germany, gave the go-ahead for the IMF to sell 10 
million ounces of its $27 billion in gold reserves to help finance 
the IMF portion of debt relief for poor countries.

<HEADLINE> Knight-Ridder To Unveil Web Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Knight Ridder is preparing to transform  
its newspaper Web sites into a nationwide network of regional 
Internet portals, hoping to target advertising to people who use 
the sites as their first stop in cyberspace. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement Tuesday by Knight Ridder chief executive Tony  
Ridder came one day after The Washington Post said it would 
transform its newspaper Web site into a regional Internet portal 
and The New York Times announced plans to build a portal targeting 
upscale users. 
</P>
<P>
	Portals are starting points for computer users when they surf  
the Web, a place for them to go when they want other things. If 
portals offer enough services in one place, the theory is that the 
audience will grow and spend enough time on the site to persuade 
advertisers to buy more space there. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridder also told analysts in New York on Tuesday that the  
company may spin off its Internet investments in the future, which 
could capitalize on the phenomenal stock performance of pure 
Internet companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight Ridder already has 29 linked Web sites in the company's  
newspaper markets and 16 other Web sites. The portal project, 
``Real Cities 2,'' would transform these sites into regional hubs 
in the top 25 U.S. advertising markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our vision of a portal site goes way beyond fulfilling the  
news interest of consumers. It's a place to organize the Web with a 
local perspective,'' said Kathy Yates, acting president of Knight 
Ridder New Media. 
</P>
<P>
	Partners in the project include A.H. Belo Corp., publisher of  
the Dallas Morning News, and Central Newspapers Inc., publisher of 
the Arizona Republic, the companies said. The three companies will 
share the advertising revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight Ridder, which publishes 32 daily newspapers, also holds a  
stake with seven other newspaper publishers in the independent 
Classified Ventures Web product.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Aid Those Who Defied NRA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House is promising political life  
support to Democratic lawmakers who risk their seats to vote for 
gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll go out and do anything we can to help people who vote  
the right way,'' White House chief of staff John Podesta said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Podesta made the remarks in an interview with The Associated  
Press as his boss was returning from a week-long European trip 
prepared to refocus on domestic policies such as gun control, race 
relations and prescription drug coverage for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials have said they would give senior citizens  
prescription benefits for the first time, requiring them to pay a 
monthly premium to help cover the costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Revealing a new wrinkle, Podesta said the poorest people would  
not have to pay the full premium. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people will get help with the premium at the lower end of  
the scale, but the premium will be fixed so that it's universal,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not say how much the plan would cost or how the White  
House wants to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will put down a complete plan that ... finds savings in the  
current Medicare system but modernizes it by including a 
prescription drug plan that is universal and affordable,'' Podesta 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	On gun control, some Democrats, particularly those from rural  
and Southern districts, fear that a vote against the National Rifle 
Association will unleash massive advertising and organizing 
campaigns to defeat them in the next election. Democrats believe 
gun control was a factor that helped Republicans take control of 
the House in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Podesta said Clinton would use his office to explain the  
Democrats' case on gun control and will help raise money to ensure 
that party lawmakers can defend their votes in the 2000 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be a politically sustainable vote,'' he said. ``I  
don't think it's a vote that will cost anybody their seat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On other subjects, Podesta:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Refused to set a deadline for withdrawing peacekeeping troops  
from Kosovo. Clinton was ``a little bit quick'' in setting a 
deadline for pulling out troops in Bosnia and ``that turned out not 
to be the right way to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Said the Justice Department, after a long delay, will soon  
follow through with Clinton's promise to file a lawsuit against 
tobacco companies. The government has incurred smoking-related 
costs through a variety of agencies, including Veterans Affairs and 
the Pentagon, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Deflected criticism of Clinton's race initiative, saying the  
president will release his report on race relations. The Kosovo 
crisis cut into time set aside for the race project, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Said he expects the president to campaign for his wife,  
Hillary Rodham Clinton, and help her raise money if she decides to 
seek a New York Senate seat in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Suggested that George W. Bush, the Republican presidential  
front-runner, will pay a political price for being endorsed by a 
majority of GOP House members. Congress' handling of gun control 
and the federal budget will be particularly troublesome for the 
Texas governor, he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there are burdens that come with aligning himself with  
(House Majority Whip Tom) DeLay and others in the Republican 
Party,'' Podesta said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun control legislation backed by Clinton was defeated in the  
House last Friday, leaving the fate of the issue uncertain. The 
rejection came as many Democrats rebelled against NRA-backed 
provisions in the bill to loosen some existing gun controls while 
dozens of conservative Republicans objected to the imposition of 
new ones. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate passed its own gun control bill after the horrific  
shootings at a Colorado high school. Despite the defeat of the 
House bill, negotiations between the two houses are expected this 
summer on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Jill Schroeder, spokeswoman for the GOP House campaign  
committee, said Clinton can't save Democrats from a vote against 
guns. 
</P>
<P>
	``These people now have records,'' she said. ``They voted  
against enforcement issues. They voted against cultural issues and 
they voted against juvenile justice issues. In rural areas, these 
are important things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Laura Nichols, spokeswoman for House Minority Leader Dick  
Gephardt, said her boss told Democrats that the gun control 
measures were good policy and safe politics. Clinton can help by 
explaining the case to voters, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe the president has more credibility on this issue  
than the NRA,'' Nichols said.

<HEADLINE> Priest Charged With Smuggling $2.4B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A Catholic priest who took a vow of poverty was  
charged Wednesday with trying to smuggle into the country $2.4 
billion in fake Treasury notes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Mario Beato-Prieto, 35, a Spanish citizen who was  
running a parochial school in the Philippines, was arrested Tuesday 
at Kennedy Airport after U.S. Customs agents discovered he was 
carrying the fake currency in his luggage. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the priest tried to sell 24 phony $100 million  
notes through a broker. He also had $2,000 in cash, plus a document 
indicating he had access to another $65 billion in fake currency. 
</P>
<P>
	But the notes looked more like $100 million bills adorned with a  
likeness of Grover Cleveland, marred by typos and runny ink. 
</P>
<P>
	They were confiscated after the priest arrived on a flight from  
South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear what the penalty Beato-Prieto would  
face if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	The bald, skinny priest was wearing faded blue jeans Wednesday  
when he appeared for arraignment in Brooklyn federal court. After 
he pleaded innocent to a charge of foreign transport of false 
documents, two fellow Spanish priests -- like Beato-Prieto, members 
of the Augustinian order -- asked the Magistrate Cheryl Pollak to 
release him into their custody. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very nice two priests are here, but there's obviously  
something about this defendant they don't know,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyer Abraham Clott also explained that the church  
could not raise bail because Augustinians take a vow of poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said she would free Beato-Prieto on Thursday if the  
four priests living at the Holy Rosary rectory signed a $25,000 
bond. The defendant would be under church arrest, confined to the 
rectory and the chapel when not in court. 
</P>
<P>
	At the request of the priests, the judge also agreed that  
Beato-Prieto could help say Mass.

<HEADLINE> Greetings Co. To Shut Canadian Unit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- American Greeting Corp. plans to close its  
Canadian greeting cards plant and distribution center, eliminating 
650 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the company will continue to sell its cards and other  
products in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Morry Weiss, American Greetings chairman and chief executive  
officer, said Wednesday the decision is part of the Cleveland-based 
company's restructuring of its international operations. 
</P>
<P>
	American Greetings spokesman Jim King said a Carlton Cards plant  
in Toronto and a distribution center in nearby Brampton, Ontario, 
will be closed. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlton Cards, an American Greetings subsidiary, has the largest  
sales, service and marketing organization in the Canadian greeting 
cards industry, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	As of March 1, all American Greetings products sold in Canada  
will be made in the United States, Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
	American Greetings expects to take a charge of $30 million  
against its earnings in the second quarter for costs associated 
with the closings. American Greetings expects the consolidated 
operations will save about $12 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Ian Cameron, senior economic development director for the city  
of Toronto, said the city had no warning. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a corporate calling program, much the same as many  
American cities, and in fact we have visited Carlton Cards not long 
ago,'' Cameron said. ``We're disappointed. We're shocked that it's 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``By law we are unable to offer things like tax incentives. From  
a municipal standpoint there's not much we can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of American Greetings fell 56 1/4 cents to $29 in trading on  
the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Seeking Missing Israeli Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress is seeking to base decisions on  
future U.S. aid to Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinian Authority on 
those governments' efforts to find the whereabouts of three Israeli 
soldiers believed missing since Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
	By a 415-5 vote on Tuesday, the House approved legislation that  
urges the State Department to intensify efforts to locate the three 
and secure their release. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill states that the president should take into account the  
``willingness of these governments'' to help in locating the 
soldiers in determining whether ``to provide U.S. economic aid and 
other forms of assistance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The missing soldiers are Zachary Baumel, who has dual  
citizenship in the United States and Israel, Yehuda Katz and Zvi 
Feldman. All three were captured during a 1982 tank battle in 
Lebanon. June 11 marked the 17th anniversary of their captivity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. and Mrs. Baumel deserve answers, as do the Feldman and  
Katz families,'' said Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., chairman of the 
House International Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the legislation ``emphasizes the importance which  
Congress places on helping these families locate their sons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is nonbinding. A similar measure is expected to be  
taken up in the Senate.

<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The mayor of Newark is now a state senator  
as well, and he thinks that should be illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe James was sworn in Monday to succeed a senator who  
recently died, and he now collects two paychecks that make him New 
Jersey's highest-paid elected official. He immediately introduced a 
bill that would ban big-city officeholders like him from also 
holding legislative seats. 
</P>
<P>
	James had been criticized after seeking the legislative  
appointment, which was made by Democratic Party officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have stated over and over again that we should attack the  
law and not the individual,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	James' job as senator pays $35,000. He also makes about $169,000  
as mayor. He said he intends to run in the fall for a full term in 
the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-term mayor would not say which job he would keep if his  
bill became law.

<HEADLINE> Rock Beat: Jimmy Buffett </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- This is no ``Tears of a Clown'' scenario -- not  
by a long shot -- but the musician whom Jimmy Buffett sees in the 
mirror has no party hat. 
</P>
<P>
	The patron saint of Key West has carved out a remarkably  
lucrative career singing tropical-inflected folk songs in sold-out 
arenas to people who, when they close their eyes, pretend they're 
at the beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Buffett is a product of the original sensitive  
singer-songwriter era in the 1970s, and that's still the work to 
which he's drawn. Songs were written then to make people think and 
feel -- not laugh, at least not intentionally. 
</P>
<P>
	His most recent album, ``Beach House on the Moon,'' illustrates  
how he tries to satisfy his fans and his muse. 
</P>
<P>
	It features some of the comical songs his fans, known as  
``parrot heads,'' have come to expect: ``Math Suks,'' a paean to 
the arithmetically challenged by someone plainly deficient in 
spelling, and ``I Will Play for Gumbo.'' The more serious material, 
like the Bruce Cockburn-penned ``Pacing the Cage'' and the title 
cut, is where he really sinks his teeth in. 
</P>
<P>
	``The records are my avenue to go out and do the things I really  
like, which are ballads, (and) to sing things that might not 
necessarily get the crowd in an uproar at the show,'' he said. 
``The magic that goes on in the studio is still the most gratifying 
part.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buffett was as surprised as anyone by the ``parrot head''  
phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 1980s, when he was a decade removed from  
``Margaritaville'' and ``Cheeseburger in Paradise,'' he seemed 
ready to sink toward the obscurity that claims most artists when 
the hits stop. 
</P>
<P>
	He continued to tour, however, and the audiences kept getting  
bigger. They came for a good time, the chance to escape to the 
beach house in their minds. A Buffett concert has its rituals, its 
funny hats, its sing-alongs and, most important, a sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that I've been able to negotiate this with the help  
of a loyal fan base, to be 52 and not be a dinosaur, is a treat,'' 
he said. ``Because the attrition rate is, to say the least, heavy. 
I've never been able to either dissect my music or dissect why 
people come to the show. I'm just glad they do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His tours are among the year's biggest moneymakers, and he has  
built that into a small empire. He owns restaurants, sells 
merchandise like margarita mixes and writes books as well as songs. 
He is one of only six writers to top The New York Times 
best-sellers list for fiction and nonfiction. 
</P>
<P>
	With all of this, his music often gets overlooked. But Buffett's  
not one to complain, just as he knows it's part of his job to play 
``Margaritaville'' every night. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I chose a song list of Jimmy Buffett material that I'd like  
to do in a show, they'd probably start throwing tomatoes by the 
third song,'' he said. ``It would certainly tend to be more of the 
reflective stuff that I've done and that I like personally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He and his band, the Coral Reefers, have a rule: ``Seventy  
percent of the show I call songs you have to do or be killed, and 
you have 30 percent left to work with. That's enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So don't look for any ``unplugged'' tour of weepy material.  
</P>
<P>
	Buffett's new album is the last in a contract with Island  
Records, leaving him a free agent. ``I have a plan,'' he said. 
``Something tells me there's a dot-com in it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's not certain whether that means selling his music solely  
through the Internet, or just in part. At a time of flux in the 
music industry, he has the time and luxury to do pretty much what 
he wants. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a possibility to create something that's beneficial  
not only to me but to other people in the future,'' he said. ``I 
think that people are trying to reinvent the music business right 
now and I'd like to be one of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For too long, the industry has been pouring money into a limited  
number of acts and bypassing a lot of talent, he said. Buffett 
believes that will come back to haunt it. 
</P>
<P>
	In a similar vein, Buffett has created his own Internet radio  
station, hiring some of the people who worked in radio when he was 
getting started in the business. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a connection, a link between the disc jockeys and  
the artists,'' he said. ``I could name the old stations that I used 
to go into -- you hung out with DJs, you talked music. These days, 
that's a rarity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those DJs still exist, but they can't find work in what has  
evolved into the corporate umbrella of radio,'' he said. ``So I've 
kind of located a few of my old friends who are great programmers 
and musicologists and said, `Do shows for me.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Three years after he crashed his plane into Nantucket Harbor and  
nearly died, Buffett is still getting into the cockpit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It changed my life a lot in the fact that I lived through  
it,'' he said. ``I feel like I've gotten a second chance. I have to 
say that I'm more cautious and a better flyer for it.''

<HEADLINE> Energy Futures Soar  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Prices of crude oil futures soared Wednesday on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange after weekly inventory data showed an 
unexpectedly sharp decline in stockpiles, signaling a world oil 
glut is easing. 
</P>
<P>
	Other energy futures tagged along for the ride. On other  
markets, cocoa futures plunged, while gold futures rose sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude jumped after the American Petroleum Institute reported  
supplies last week tumbled 5.75 million barrels, or by 1.7 percent. 
Analysts actually had been expecting inventories to increase by as 
much 1.8 million barrels because refiners of gasoline and heating 
oil were expected to reduce purchases of crude oil. 
</P>
<P>
	Refiner processing did indeed slip as oil companies find weaker  
profits in making relatively cheap gas and heating oil from the 
relatively expensive crude, but a drop in imports was even greater 
and the nation's crude oil supplies shrank. 
</P>
<P>
	A concerted effort by world oil producers to reduce daily output  
appeared to be paying off. Imports to the United States tumbled by 
237,000 barrels a day, according to the API. 
</P>
<P>
	Light, sweet crude for August delivery rose 70 cents to $18.45  
barrel; July unleaded gasoline rose 1.51 cents to 52.66 cents a 
gallon; July heating oil rose 2.04 cents to 45.66 cents a gallon; 
July natural gas rose 2.6 cents to $2.264 for each 1,000 cubic 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Cocoa futures fell sharply on the Board of Trade of the City of  
New York as speculative buying dried up, betting chocolate 
manufacturers have secured enough supplies to last for weeks 
without buying. 
</P>
<P>
	Cocoa prices have been caught in a tug-of-war between nearly  
waning shipments of midyear crops for Ghana and Ivory Coast and 
waning purchases from end-users. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices also have pressured recently by favorable growing weather  
across West Africa. Ivory Coast, the world's largest producer, had 
been plagued by dry weather, but conditions have improved markedly 
in recent days, which could allow hardy cocoa trees to bounce back. 
</P>
<P>
	September cocoa fell $55 to $1,080 a ton, while the spot July  
contract fell $57 to $1,077 a ton. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold jumped on the New York Mercantile Exchange amid growing  
congressional opposition to planned gold sales by the International 
Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Under U.S. law, Congress must approve a plan by the world's  
seven richest nations to sell 10 million ounces of gold from IMF 
stockpiles. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale would go toward debt relief for poor countries, but  
some congressmen are arguing the sale would push gold prices down 
so far it would hurt the very countries it seeks to help. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, gold prices have tumbled in recent months amid fears  
that a wave of government gold sales would erase the metal's value 
as an investment tool. The British government next month will begin 
selling more than half its reserves, and other countries, including 
Switzerland, also are mulling major sales. 
</P>
<P>
	August gold rose $1.90 to $261.80 a troy ounce.

<HEADLINE>  Stocks End Mixed; Dow Off 54.77 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks fell for a third straight  
session today as persistent concerns about interest rates sent bond 
prices tumbling, but technology and small-cap stocks outperformed 
the Dow Jones industrial average. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of trading on Wall Street, the Dow was down 54.77  
at 10,666.86 after falling nearly 105 points earlier in the 
session. The blue-chip index lost 94.35 yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed.  
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 3.57 to 1,332.31, and the  
technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index rose 11.56 to 2,591.82. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-5 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,760 down, 1,257 up and 555 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 720.42 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
710.31 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 2.36 to 630.75, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 5.69 to 771.16. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 1.24 to 446.09.  
</P>
<P>
	The stock and bond markets remained on edge as they awaited the  
Federal Reserve's meeting next week on interest rates. The Fed is 
widely expected to push rates higher in a bid to slow economic 
growth. Market players remain divided, however, on whether the Fed 
will raise rates more than once. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market continues to mark time,'' said Alan Ackerman,  
senior vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. in New York. ``People are 
very conflicted by fear of what the Fed will do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd.,  
said that while many traders are beginning to accept the 
possibility of two rate increases, some fear the Fed will raise 
rates three times, wiping out the rate cuts that the central bank 
initiated last fall to help protect the global economy from Asia's 
financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Three steps and a stumble,'' Bleier said. ``There's a belief  
that the bull market could not survive three rate increases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rates rose in the bond market in response to that uncertainty;  
today, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond, which moves in the 
opposite direction to prices, rose to 6.11 percent from late 
Tuesday's 6.06 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks, which ended a five-session rally on Tuesday,  
managed a slight rebound. Merger speculation about several smaller 
Internet players stimulated buying. Earthlink Network rose amid 
rumors it might be acquired by computer maker Gateway. 
</P>
<P>
	Some big names including Cisco Systems posted modest gains. But  
networking company 3Com fell sharply a day after reporting fiscal 
fourth-quarter earnings that beat expectations. Company officials 
warned that sales of some of its key products might slip, prompting 
a number of downgrades from investment firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman Sachs fell after reporting second-quarter results that  
beat analysts' expectations. Goldman mirrored the Tuesday 
performance of rival brokerage Lehman Brothers, which fell after 
announcing strong earnings. Goldman's stock rose earlier this week 
as Wall Street anticipated good results, and traders were taking 
profits today. 
</P>
<P>
	Ackerman said the brokerages are also paid a price from  
investors' interest-rate jitters. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this market, good news is met with relief, but doesn't  
necessarily engender any additional commitment,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other banks and brokerages also fell today. They are especially  
vulnerable to higher rates, which can discourage borrowers and hurt 
lending volume. J.P. Morgan was the biggest decliner among Dow 
components. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil companies got a boost from the American Petroleum  
Institute's Tuesday report that showed the nation's crude oil 
supplies fell 1.7 percent last week.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan on  
trial in Turkey, the State Department is suggesting Americans 
abroad should ``review their personal security'' and obtain the 
latest security information from a U.S. embassy or consulate. 
</P>
<P>
	There were violent demonstrations in Europe and in other areas  
when the leader of the Kurdistan Workers Party was captured by 
Turkish forces in February in Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
	In a worldwide caution, the State Department said, without  
elaboration, that U.S. government personnel and facilities were 
taking appropriate security measures.

<P>
	EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- Women track and field athletes, hoping to  
project a new and different image for the sport, have posed for a 
calendar for the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	They are photographed in black and white wearing body paint,  
wings and, in one case, a pair of strategically placed discuses. 
</P>
<P>
	`It's very tasteful nudes,'' said high jumper Amy Acuff, a  
two-time NCAA champion for UCLA, the 1997 national champion and the 
creator of the project. ``It's artistic and creative. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard only positive feedback so far, especially through  
the track and field community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gwen Wentland, also a high jumper and a two-time NCAA runner-up  
for Kansas State, said, ``A lot of people are skeptical, but once 
they see it, they will realize how artistic it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm painted gold from head to toe,'' Wentland said. ``I have  
gold in my hair and it's twisted into dreadlocks. It took about 
three hours to complete the painting. It's very shiny and 
accentuates the shadows and curves much more so than if I was just 
standing there nude without any kind of sheen or paint on my 
body.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought she (Wentland) looked like one of those girls from  
the `Goldfinger' movie,'' Acuff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurdler Angie Vaughn, wearing the butterfly wings and body  
paint, is on the cover. Others in the calendar are long jumper Dawn 
Burrell, pole vaulters Stacy Dragila and Jill Wittenwyler, 
sprinters Inger Miller and Cheryl Taplin, middle distance runner 
Jill McMullen, distance runner Nnenna Lynch, discus thrower Suzy 
Powell and high jumper Tisha Waller. 
</P>
<P>
	The calendars go on sale this weekend during the USA  
Championships at the University of Oregon's Hayward Field. They 
will cost $16, with half the money going to the athletes and the 
other half to the Florence Griffith Joyner Community Empowerment 
Foundation, which benefits disadvantaged children. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MISSING IN ACTION:* Three of the nation's best athletes are  
injured and will be absent from the USA Outdoor Track and Field 
Championships, which begin Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest name is Dan O'Brien. The 1996 Olympic gold medalist,  
three-time world champion and world record-holder in the decathlon 
has turf toe on his left foot. With the top three finishers in each 
event qualifying for the U.S. team for the World Championships at 
Seville, Spain, in August, O'Brien could miss out on an opportunity 
for his fourth world title. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he is counting on his past accomplishments getting him  
a wild-card invitation from the International Amateur Athletic 
Federation. Defending world champions are granted an automatic 
berth in the World Championships, but O'Brien did not compete at 
the worlds in 1997. He won in 1991, 1993 and 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Others missing from the nationals will be pole vaulter Lawrence  
Johnson and women's triple jumper Sheila Hudson. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who set the U.S. record in 1996 and won national titles  
in 1996 and 1997, has a broken left heel and a dislocated left 
ankle from a recent dirt bike accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Hudson, the U.S. record-holder, defending national champion and  
winner of seven U.S. titles, the first in 1987, is out with a 
hyperextended knee. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *IS IT A RECORD OR NOT?:* Stacy Dragila's latest American record  
in the pole vault could come become awash in controversy. That's 
because she accomplished the feat at a beach competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Dragila surpassed her record by clearing 15 feet, three-quarters  
of an inch Sunday at Santa Barbara, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Marks set away from a track generally are not accepted, since  
they are considered exhibitions. But if USA Track &AMP; Field 
determines on examination that the facility was properly laid out, 
there were certified officials, a minimum of three competitors 
(which there were) and all other rules were adhered to, it might 
approve the mark. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PETRANOFF'S RETURN:* Tom Petranoff, the former world  
record-holder in the javelin, will be competing in the USA 
Championships for the first time since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	The globetrotting, rebellious 41-year Petranoff has spent most  
of the past 11 years in South Africa and parts unknown. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the U.S. champion in 1985 and 1986, an Olympian in 1984  
and 1988, and was ranked No. 1 in the U.S. from 1983-87 and 
1989-90. He finished second in the 1992 World Cup for the African 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	His best throw with the old javelin was 327 feet, 2 inches, in  
1983.

fourth-quarter earnings that beat expectations. Company officials 
warned that sales of some of its key products might slip, prompting 
a number of downgrades from investment firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman Sachs fell after reporting second-quarter results that  
beat analysts' expectations. Goldman mirrored the Tuesday 
performance of rival brokerage Lehman Brothers, which fell after 
announcing strong earnings. Goldman's stock rose earlier this week 
as Wall Street anticipated good results, and traders were taking 
profits today. 
</P>
<P>
	Ackerman said the brokerages are also paid a price from  
investors' interest-rate jitters. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this market, good news is met with relief, but doesn't  
necessarily engender any additional commitment,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other banks and brokerages also fell today. They are especially  
vulnerable to higher rates, which can discourage borrowers and hurt 
lending volume. J.P. Morgan was the biggest decliner among Dow 
components. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil companies got a boost from the American Petroleum  
Institute's Tuesday report that showed the nation's crude oil 
supplies fell 1.7 percent last week.

<HEADLINE> John Lennon's Drawings on Display </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LIVERPOOL, England (AP) -- A collection of drawings by John  
Lennon that trace his life from the later days of the Beatles to 
the birth of his son Sean has gone on display. 
</P>
<P>
	The permanent display of limited edition prints, unveiled  
Tuesday, is housed at Liverpool's Matthew Street Gallery, yards 
away from the site of the Cavern Club, where the Beatles once 
played. 
</P>
<P>
	The prints date to 1968 and show the years Lennon spent with  
Yoko Ono, starting with their meeting, their famous bed-in for 
world peace at the Amsterdam Hilton and the birth of Sean. 
</P>
<P>
	``Drawn by one of the most important cultural figures of our  
time, these graphics celebrate human love and communication -- two 
themes at the heart of John Lennon's contribution to the art of the 
twentieth century,'' said gallery spokeswoman Christine Colvin.

<HEADLINE> Randy Newman Talks About His Tunes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The narrator of a Randy Newman song usually  
isn't Randy Newman. It's a person he made up -- often not an 
admirable character. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having a narrator, you can't trust what he says, that's my  
basic style,'' Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although critics call his lyrics honest, irreverent, cynical and  
ironic, some listeners didn't realize the irony of ``Short 
People,'' his best known song, and were offended. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think cynical is kind of narrow,'' the 55-year-old Newman  
said. ``I think it's explanation by exaggeration. People in my 
songs are usually worse than anyone in the audience. It isn't like 
I'm saying there's a secret hatred for short people out there. That 
narrator is just nuts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven years ago, Newman wrote three or four autobiographical  
songs for his ``Land of Dreams'' album, just to see if he could do 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	For his new CD ``Bad Love'' (DreamWorks), it was easier to write  
autobiographical songs because there were more topics that 
intrigued him. ``People have sort of got what I do now, to a large 
degree,'' said Newman as he offered explanations of some of the 
album's songs. 
</P>
<P>
	``'I Miss You' is sort of an odd song, a love song to my first  
wife. I called her when I wrote it. I said, 'It doesn't mean I'm 
going to move where you are and stalk you.' I still do love her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for ``I'm Dead (But I Don't Know It),'' Newman explained:  
``It's about all of us rock people going on much longer than anyone 
thought we would be able to and refusing to leave the stage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And there is likely some reflection of Newman in ``I Want  
Everyone to Like Me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's probably some truth that I have that kind of shallow  
desire. I've been overtipping for years,'' he said. But Newman 
acknowledged: ``The nature of what I write sort of makes it 
impossible. Everyone is not going to like me. I wanted to write 
about that phenomenon. To performers, it's life and death. You go 
out on stage. Of course you want everyone to like you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His self-titled debut album was released in 1968. It contained  
``I Think It's Going to Rain Today'' -- which Judy Collins also 
recorded -- and ``Davy the Fat Boy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newman has been nominated for 12 Academy Awards, most recently  
for best original musical or comedy score for ``A Bug's Life,'' 
best original dramatic score for ``Pleasantville'' and best song 
for ``That'll Do'' from ``Babe: Pig in the City.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last composer to have three simultaneous Oscar nominations  
was Andre Previn in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never have taken an acceptance speech to the awards,'' he  
said. ``My uncle Alfred Newman was nominated 40 times. I saw him 
win for the wrong things. I vote for cinematography and costume 
design. What do I know about that? It bothers me very little I 
haven't won. I like very much being nominated by the music 
department.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newman is busy writing the score for ``Toy Story II.''  
</P>
<P>
	How does he compare writing music for films with writing songs  
to sing himself? 
</P>
<P>
	``Coming up with a very good song is a more mysterious and more  
special thing. I don't quite understand how I wrote some of my 
songs. It seemed like they were gifts. Maybe it happens because you 
do it a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He recently played in New Orleans and appeared at the SunFest in  
West Palm Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``In New Orleans, I always get just about the best reception I  
get anywhere in the country. In Florida, I've sold less records 
than I have in Antwerp,'' Newman said. ``But this was fine. I could 
hear Kenny G playing on the other side of the field. At this time 
in my life, I enjoy the weirdness of doing this for a living.''

<HEADLINE> NBA Finals Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Topic of discussion before Game 4 of the NBA  
Finals on Wednesday night: Things that drive Jeff Van Gundy crazy. 
</P>
<P>
	Item No. 1: Fouls and everything about them.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's like we're the only team that ever fouls,'' the Knicks  
coach said, his voice laced with sarcasm. ``Every game we win, it's 
because the officials gave it to us. And I'm so sick of it, I can't 
stand it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy was referring to the disparity in fouls called in the  
Knicks' 89-81 victory in Game 3 Monday night. After the Spurs 
enjoyed a 66-31 advantage in free throw attempts in the first two 
games, the Knicks shot 30 free throws to San Antonio's 22 in Game 
4. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've shot I think 27 less free throws in the series than they  
have, and somehow we're getting the benefit of this great 
whistle,'' Van Gundy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The target of Van Gundy's criticism in front of a small group of  
reporters wasn't clear; no one in the room had brought it up. 
</P>
<P>
	No one brought up David Robinson either, but that didn't stop  
Van Gundy from ripping him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Robinson flailing his arms and diving into people has by far  
gotten the benefit of the calls more than any one of our guys,'' 
Van Gundy said. ``Marcus (Camby) has to hope that they let him play 
tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Camby started for the first in the series in Game 3 and picked  
up two fouls in six minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has to hope that when Robinson dives into him, they're not  
thinking top 50 vs. third-year player,'' Van Gundy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Robinson has gotten to the free throw line his entire  
career,'' Van Gundy said. ``With (Tim) Duncan's greatness, Robinson 
has gotten to the free throw line more this year in a lot less 
minutes. He's just adept at drawing fouls. Now, I'm not saying 
they're offensive fouls by any stretch of the imagination. But what 
I'm saying is, if anybody has gotten the benefit of the doubt, 
whistle-wise, in this series, it's him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then came this question, lobbed to the eager Van Gundy like a  
batting practice pitch: Is Robinson as good at drawing fouls as 
Indiana's Reggie Miller? 
</P>
<P>
	``No one falls down on every shot,'' Van Gundy said.  
</P>
<P>
	Asked to respond to Van Gundy's assessment of the foul  
disparity, San Antonio's Sean Elliott said, ``I think that's the 
stance he has to take.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You saw how they called the two games in San Antonio and how  
they called the game here,'' Elliott said. On the road in the 
playoffs, ``You pretty much go out there with the mind set that 
you're not going to get the calls.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SHOOTING THE BULL:* Steve Kerr is fielding a lot of questions  
about his old team, the Chicago Bulls. So many, in fact, that Kerr 
estimates 40 percent of what he's talked about publicly has dealt 
with the Bulls, 60 percent with the Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I attribute it to off days, when you can't write about the  
game and you need something to write about. And that one's a 
natural. It's no big deal,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerr has averaged almost 12 minutes per game in the first three  
games of the series, shooting 3-for-8 overall and 1-for-2 from 
3-point range. 
</P>
<P>
	His role with the Spurs is not as big as it was with the Bulls  
when he won three championships from 1996-1998, including the 
title-winning shot in the 1997 finals against Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerr has two more years remaining on his contract and plans to  
retire afterward. He'd said like to stay involved in the game, 
either as a coach, broadcaster or team executive. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he had spoken recently to Phil Jackson, his former  
coach in Chicago who recently took over the Lakers' head coaching 
position. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's thrilled,'' Kerr said. ``He's really excited and he never  
thought twice about taking that job. It's the job he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BREAK IT UP:* Coach Jeff Van Gundy's interview session after  
the Knicks' shootaround Wednesday morning ended abruptly after a 
cameraman and a reporter jostled for space in the semicircle around 
the coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can't we all get along?'' Van Gundy said after watching the  
mini-fracas with a look of contempt on his face. After it 
continued, Van Gundy said: ``I'm out of here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shootarounds at the Knicks' practice facility in Purchase, N.Y.,  
have become impossibly crowded by the large increase of media 
covering the finals. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *AROUND THE WORLD:* Allan Houston, whose 34 points led the  
Knicks to victory in Game 3, put on an impressive show during the 
pregame shoot-around. The breakdown: 
</P>
<P>
	Right baseline: 17-for-22  
</P>
<P>
	Right baseline, left-handed: 0-for-2.  
</P>
<P>
	Right wing: 13-for-13.  
</P>
<P>
	Top of the key: 11-for-16.  
</P>
<P>
	Houston missed four straight from the top and was 1-for-5 at one  
point.

<HEADLINE> Mazda Recalls B-Series Pickups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Mazda Motor Corp. is recalling 22,500 B-series  
pickup trucks from the 1998-99 model years to inspect and, if 
needed, replace the vehicles' cruise control cable. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall announced Tuesday covers all 1998-99 cruise  
control-equipped B-series pickups sold in the United States. On 
those vehicles, the cable could come into contact with the cruise 
control servo pulley and prevent the throttle from returning to 
idle when disengaging the cruise control. This could result in a 
stuck throttle, Mazda said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The automaker said it was unaware of any accidents resulting  
from the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners of the affected pickups were being contacted by mail and  
asked to take them to an authorized Mazda dealer for the inspection 
and, if necessary, free replacement of the cruise control cable. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, Mazda is asking owners to avoid using the  
cruise control system until it has been inspected. Vehicle 
operation is not affected when the cruise control is not engaged, 
Mazda said.

<HEADLINE> Plane Makes Street Landing in L.A. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A small plane crash landed at a busy  
intersection today and barreled between a pair of approaching 
school buses filled with children, ripping the fuel tanks from the 
plane but causing only minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could have been a catastrophe,'' said Socorro Serrano,  
spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
	Serrano said there were 42 students from Parthenia Street  
Elementary School and six from Lassen Elementary School on the 
buses. 
</P>
<P>
	The twin-engine Cessna 402 was headed for nearby Van Nuys  
Airport about 3 p.m. when it was forced to make an emergency 
landing on Hayvenhurst Avenue, airport spokeswoman Stacy Geere 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	As the plane reached Hayvenhurst and Parthenia Street, it  
collided with the buses as they entered the intersection from 
opposite directions. The impact tore the wing tips off the plane 
and wrecked the front ends of the buses. The plane rolled on for 
1,500 feet before coming to a stop. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody was screaming,'' 6-year-old Christian Garcia said  
later at Parthenia, where his mother went to meet him after hearing 
about the accident over the radio. 
</P>
<P>
	The 33-year-old female driver of one bus was taken to Northridge  
Medical Center in good condition with neck and back injuries, fire 
spokesman Brian Humphrey said. A 6-year-old child was treated at 
the scene for minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	An elementary school girl also was taken to Northridge Medical  
Center, where hospital spokesman Barry Ginsbarg said she was listed 
in fair condition and being examined for possible head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was truly a miracle,'' Humphrey said.  
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters led children off the buses one at a time. Some  
children seemed dazed, while others skipped or hopped away from the 
wreckage. Firefighters passed out soft drinks to the youngsters as 
they sat waiting on curbs. Another bus was sent to pick up the 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot climbed uninjured from his plane. It was not  
immediately known why he was forced to land on the street, Geere 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Nuys is 20 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles.

<HEADLINE> Khrushchev's Son Passes U.S. Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Sergei Khrushchev breezed through the  
U.S. citizenship test today, and next month will swear loyalty to a 
country and way of life that Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev -- his 
father -- promised to bury. 
</P>
<P>
	``We both passed,'' Khrushchev said with a smile as he and his  
wife left the Providence office of the U.S. Immigration and 
Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our heart is here. We will be good citizens,'' said the  
63-year-old Khrushchev, who looks much like his deceased dad. 
</P>
<P>
	Khrushchev missed one out of 20 questions on the test. His wife,  
Valentina Golenko, got all of them right. 
</P>
<P>
	Back during the Cold War, when Nikita Khrushchev was in power,  
his son's decision to become an American would probably have been 
seen as an act of treason. So is Nikita Khrushchev spinning in his 
grave? 
</P>
<P>
	Sergei Khrushchev doesn't think so.  
</P>
<P>
	``The world has changed'' since the times when his father was in  
power, he said. But then he added: ``I hope he would approve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Khrushchev has said his father's ``we will bury you'' remark was  
misunderstood. The remark meant that capitalism would die and that 
the Soviet economic system would bury it. 
</P>
<P>
	Khrushchev was besieged by reporters after taking the  
citizenship test. All wanted to know why he had decided to become 
an American citizen. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you are living in a country, it is natural to become a  
citizen,'' replied Khrushchev, who moved to the United States in 
1991 and is a professor at Brown University. 
</P>
<P>
	He argued there was no irony in him becoming an American citizen  
because his country of birth and the United States are no longer 
enemies. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Khrushchev conceded there might be Stalinists back in his  
homeland who would view him as a traitor. 
</P>
<P>
	``But you find crazy people everywhere,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	At the height of the Cold War, Khrushchev was an engineer who  
built rockets that were pointed at the West. He came to the United 
States first as a visiting professor. He says he decided to stay 
because he liked the freedom the found here. 
</P>
<P>
	If it weren't for their heavy Russian accents, Khrushchev and  
his wife would seem as American as baseball, apple pie and hot 
dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	They have a ranch house in a Providence suburb. He drives a  
Buick. 
</P>
<P>
	He and his wife will be taking the citizenship oath on July 12.

<HEADLINE> Senate Kills Quota Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation that would restrict foreign steel  
shipments is dead. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. steel industry did not obtain a majority, much less the  
60 votes needed to clear a procedural hurdle on the quota bill. The 
Senate voted 57-42 against a motion Tuesday to restrict debate and 
supporters do not plan to try again. 
</P>
<P>
	``This issue is unfortunately dead,'' said Sen. Rick Santorum,  
R-Pa., who was in charge of garnering Republican support for the 
quota measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Santorum said lawmakers now will regroup to figure out other  
ways to help the industry. He said they may try to strengthen a 
bill the Senate Finance Committee approved last week to address the 
steel industry's long-term health. Quota supporters complained that 
bill does not address the industry's plight in the short run. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. steel industry sought quotas to combat low-priced steel  
imports it blames for thousands of layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports reached record highs in 1998 in the wake of the Asian  
economic crisis, which reduced demand for steel abroad and forced 
foreign producers to look for a market in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration lobbied against the bill, and several  
senators expressed concerns about its effects on the national 
economy. Opponents say the quotas violate international trade 
agreements and could prompt other countries to cut off their 
markets to U.S. exports. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bill will kill jobs. This bill will start a trade war,''  
said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas. ``Since we are the greatest 
beneficiary of international trade, we will lose more than anyone 
else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The issue divided Senate Democrats, many of whom were personally  
contacted by Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Commerce Secretary 
William Daley and urged to reject quotas. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters had counted on getting the votes of all 45 Democrats  
and 15 of the Republicans behind quotas. They did get 15 
Republicans but persuaded only 27 Democrats to join them. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley praised the Senate for rejecting legislation that he  
considered ``bad for the economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he warned that foreign producers should not take the Senate  
vote as a sign that the United States will permit illegal pricing. 
He said the administration already has imposed sanctions short of 
quotas to address those practices. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Chief Expects 24 Hour Trades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nasdaq chief Frank Zarb has a vision of what  
the global stock market will be in a few years: digital, open 24 
hours, letting people make trades instantly anywhere from their 
computers, cellphones, pagers and handheld organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech Wednesday at the National Press Club, Zarb -- the  
chairman of the National Association of Securities Dealers, which 
operates the electronic Nasdaq Stock Market -- said officials are 
examining a number of structural shifts to allow it to compete in 
the market of the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Zarb said NASD is considering separating out its regulatory  
division and merging it with the New York Stock Exchange's for both 
quality and financial reasons. Zarb also noted that Nasdaq was 
considering going public by selling stock in itself to key 
investment firms and possibly later to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq chief's comments come at a time when the global  
financial markets are expanding in an unprecedented manner. Only 
last week, Zarb announced plans to establish a trading exchange 
similar to Nasdaq's in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq also has set up a joint Web site with Hong Kong's stock  
exchange that will allow U.S. investors to trade in Hong Kong 
securities, has signed a similar deal with the Australian Stock 
Exchange, and is looking into new alliances in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Zarb said extended trading hours soon will be a reality because  
``investors want it. ... People want to be able to trade their 
personal stock portfolios at a time convenient to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Ideally, extended hours shouldn't be implemented piecemeal by  
(stock) exchanges or the new electronic communications networks 
that trade stocks,'' Zarb urged in his speech. ``Investors would be 
best served if the industry could move to new hours in a 
coordinated way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE voted this month to extend trading hours, but not until  
the second half of next year. Before the NYSE expands its hours it 
wants first to ensure there are no glitches with the Year 2000 
computer bug and the planned switch to reporting stock prices in 
decimals instead of fractions. 
</P>
<P>
	The go-slow decision came a week after Nasdaq voted to begin  
extending its hours into the evening as soon as this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which is expected  
to eventually approve proposals for extended trading hours, 
announced Wednesday it was convening a financial industry 
``summit'' on the issue with Zarb's securities dealers' group and 
the NYSE. The June 30 meeting will be closed to the public and the 
press, an SEC spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The global expansion by the world's second-largest stock market  
has sharpened its competition with the largest, the NYSE, which 
uses a traditional trading floor. Nasdaq also recently took over 
the American Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The two exchanges may be able to help one another if they merged  
their regulatory operations, Zarb said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A high-tech, independent single regulator, jointly owned by  
the markets, with advanced electronic surveillance could be better 
for investors, markets and the securities industry. This could 
lessen costs and increase depth of regulation, as well as eliminate 
potential conflicts of interest between regulators and the stock 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the NYSE had no immediate comment on the proposal.  
</P>
<P>
	Zarb, looking a few years ahead, said ``trading floors and  
paper, for the most part, will be rendered obsolete by competition 
and technology. ... This 21st-century stock market will be ... 
computer screen-based, technology-driven and open to all -- all 
because people will have access to information that they want to 
act on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People will be able to get instant stock quotes and trades  
anytime day or night, he said, using computers, cellphones, pagers 
and hand-held organizers. They'll even be able to get personalized 
reports on the performance of their investments from their car 
radios and digital TVs at home, he said.

<HEADLINE> Soft Fat-Hard Fat Choice Matters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	In a head-to-head comparison of all the things you can smear on  
a piece of toast or melt in the bottom of a frying pan, doctors 
have concluded that softer is better. 
</P>
<P>
	A study in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine looked at  
how harder, processed fats -- such as stick margarine, butter and 
lard -- affect cholesterol levels when compared with softer products 
like tub margarine and oil. 
</P>
<P>
	The softer products were found to be healthier because the  
harder ones have more of what are called trans fatty acids, which 
raise cholesterol and the risk of heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``Does it matter which fat you use? The bottom line is, yes, it  
matters a lot,'' said Dr. Alice H. Lichtenstein, who led the study 
at the U.S. Department of Agriculture Nutrition Center at Tufts 
University in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Lichtenstein said patients with moderately high cholesterol  
should cut out stick margarine. But she also said people would be 
better off without butter as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``People need to watch both. Because butter is very low in trans  
fatty acids does not mean that people should choose butter, because 
it is so high in saturated fat,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trans fatty acids are created during a production process called  
hydrogenation, which transforms vegetable oil into a more solid 
substance so that it will resist spoiling. Usually, foods list 
``partially hydrogenated'' oil on the label. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, 18 women and 18 men over 50 were each fed one of  
six diets for five weeks. Each diet provided 30 percent of calories 
from fat. Participants were given either soybean oil, semiliquid 
margarine, soft margarine, shortening, stick margarine or butter. 
Participants eventually were fed all six diets, and the researchers 
measured the effects on their cholesterol levels after each 
five-week period. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers checked the participants' levels of two opposing  
cholesterol forces in the bloodstream: LDL, or bad, cholesterol, 
which can clog arteries, and HDL, or good, cholesterol, which 
protects against heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
	People who consumed soybean oil reduced their levels of LDL  
cholesterol by an average of 12 percent compared with those who ate 
butter. Those given semiliquid margarine lowered their levels 11 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who ate soft margarine, the level dropped 9 percent,  
and for shortening, the level fell 7 percent. Those who ate stick 
margarine reduced their LDL cholesterol only 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Conversely, those who ate the softer fats had smaller reductions  
in HDL cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
	In another journal article, Dr. Walter C. Willett of the Harvard  
School of Public Health and colleagues noted that in Europe, 
manufacturers have been quicker to produce margarines free of trans 
fatty acids and low in saturated fat, while stick margarines still 
occupy a large portion of grocery store shelves in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Willett and Dr. Ronald M. Krauss of the American Heart  
Association said the Food and Drug Administration should require 
that trans fatty acids be labeled on products. 
</P>
<P>
	Willett also said the FDA should require fast food restaurants  
to label menu items because fried fast foods and commercially baked 
goods often contain trans fatty acids. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trans fat is the largest amount of artificial chemical in our  
food supply,'' Willett said. ``I think a lot of parents are 
concerned about their kids' health, and they should have the 
information that their kids are eating a type of fat that can be 
extremely dangerous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Margarine Manufacturers criticized  
the research, saying that the full-fat stick margarine used in the 
study is not representative of the products now found in most 
supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturers have come up with products significantly lower in  
total fat, saturated fat and trans fatty acids, the association 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
	NAMM President Richard Cristol said the industry would not  
oppose mandatory labeling of trans fatty acids. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would welcome the opportunity to use the package label to  
show consumers how we are meeting their demands for healthy, 
good-tasting and convenient margarine products,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Books and Authors Egyptian Writers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- High above a courtyard near the Egyptian  
Museum, where the clinking of glasses on tile table-tops punctuates 
the lively and loud conversations of afternoon tea drinkers, 
laundry hangs limply from tenement balconies. 
</P>
<P>
	A light breeze plays with the cigarette smoke of the talkers --  
novelists, poets, a critic or two -- who sit in the Cairo Atelier 
discussing everything from censorship to current trends in literary 
criticism to the pretensions of the new crop of poets. 
</P>
<P>
	No lonely room of one's own for Cairo's writers. The oral  
storytelling tradition in this hurly-burly capital lives on in 
serious chitchat in places like the Atelier, which triples as 
literary club, cafe and art gallery. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's the Story Club a few blocks away, or the Union of  
Writers just across the Nile, or any of a number of cafes and bars 
and tea rooms and even, increasingly, salons in private homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Critic Ibrahim Fathi knows it's possible to fritter away every  
evening in like-minded company somewhere in Cairo. But in the 
interest of getting some work done, he limits himself to once a 
week at the Atelier, a dilapidated villa with that narrow 
courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
	``People always came here to meet each other, to speak about  
their writing, to exchange books,'' he said. ``New trends in 
literature are discussed and proclaimed here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not that all the talk doesn't sometimes get tedious.  
</P>
<P>
	``You can predict what every critic will say -- he said the same  
thing about this poem, that book, this collection,'' Fathi said. 
``So people get fed up. Then new sprouts come up, and they have new 
things to say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Every Tuesday night, the Atelier holds a panel discussion on a  
new novel or the latest literary debate. But it's not unusual to 
find only a few people on the rows of chairs set up for the formal 
event, ignored by the dozens holding their own informal sessions, 
chairs tottering on uneven paving stones. 
</P>
<P>
	At his own table, Fathi held forth one night about a group of  
young poets dubbed the ``grasshoppers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They claim to devour all the old traditional poetry,'' Fathi  
explained. ``They are against all great themes, all grand 
narratives. They are living on the margins. No patriotism or 
socialism or nationalism -- they consider all these things to be 
rubbish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fathi speaks as a man who has seen such literary revolutions  
before. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are young poets, they have great talents. But their best  
work will come later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The literary scene in Cairo ``is more or less a small milieu in  
which people need to relate directly to each other to get 
motivated. It is as normal a social activity as any, just maybe a 
little more exclusive,'' said young short-story writer Youssef 
Rakha. Rakha, like Fathi, spends time -- but not too much -- at 
Atelier. 
</P>
<P>
	While Rakha cautions writer's hangouts shouldn't be  
romanticized, others have found a way to commercialize them. A 
hotel chain runs the Naguib Mahfouz Cafe, named for, but not 
otherwise associated with, Cairo's most famous writer. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1988 Nobel Prize winner was well known for his weekly visits  
to a Nile-side coffeehouse. Mahfouz's poor health, exacerbated by a 
1994 knife attack by Islamic extremists angered by his work, helped 
end his own forays into the marketplace of ideas. But tourists 
armed with paperback copies of his Cairo trilogy can get an ersatz 
taste of the city's literary life at the hotel coffee shop. 
</P>
<P>
	For the real thing, try Le Grillon, a restaurant in a downtown  
alley. Critic Ibrahim Mansour is so well-known there, any waiter 
can direct a newcomer to the thin, white-bearded figure sitting at 
a table smoking Merits, a cane propped between his knees. 
</P>
<P>
	Le Grillon is the kind of neighborhood joint where the waiter in  
charge of the water pipes seems to know, or at least have a ready 
smile for, everyone who comes in. It's possible to linger for hours 
over a bottle of beer, making a meal of the salty boiled beans 
served as bar snacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Mansour starts the evening at a table for four, but soon moves  
to a bigger one as more friends drop in. At one end of Mansour's 
long table, a group pores over photos of a sculptor's latest work. 
At the other, a director-screenwriter waves over a composer who 
happens by, and talks him into collaborating on a movie about 
Sudanese exile poetry to be shot in the Egyptian desert. 
</P>
<P>
	Mansour exchanges a warm, two-handed shake with Hesham Keshta,  
who has just started a magazine featuring new writers. They're old 
friends, even though 60-year-old Mansour declares: ``I don't think 
serious writing is flourishing now, not like before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keshta, 36, counters: ``I believe in the new writers. I am  
against everything old.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cairo's writers have at times had to fight for a place where  
young and old, maverick and traditionalist can sit together over a 
friendly drink. Novelist Ibrahim Abdel Meguid sadly recalls that 
the Union of Writers building on the Nile's Zamalek island was 
closed for more than two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	A conservative administration had objected to some of the  
writers' leftist political talk. Three years ago, Abdel Meguid, one 
of the country's most established younger writers, was part of a 
faction that overthrew the old guard in an election and reopened 
the union's headquarters, an old mansion on an avenue of stately 
embassies. 
</P>
<P>
	The union is financed by a 2 percent levy on fees publishers pay  
to Egyptian writers. It extends financial and other help to writers 
when they need it. 
</P>
<P>
	Its Cairo house is meant to be a prime meeting place. But after  
having its doors locked for so many years, Abdel Meguid said it has 
been difficult to bring writers back. The new leadership is trying 
to revive interest by publishing a newsletter. It may also publish 
a series of books by new writers, and open a coffee shop. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends, young writers seeking advice, journalists seeking a  
comment, know they can find the usually reclusive Abdel Meguid 
sipping tea at the Writer's Union every Saturday morning. An 
attendant brings the tea on a tray, a touch of elegance that is 
striking in a reception room dimmed by faded green velvet curtains 
and furnished with worn, overstuffed couches. 
</P>
<P>
	``My best relations are with poets. With other novelists,  
there's too much competitiveness,'' Abdel Meguid said, only half 
joking. His latest novel to be translated to English, ``The Other 
Place,'' revolves around a philosopher-English teacher. 
</P>
<P>
	He comes to the Writer's Union, he said, because socializing in  
his own home would disrupt the order there which he needs to write. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is our home, too. We need to see each other, to drink  
with each other, to know what's happening in the world, what's 
happening in Egypt,'' he said. ``At the end of the day, you return 
to your home and you work on your novel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Excerpts from Ibrahim Abdel Meguid's ``The Other Place,''  
translated from the Arabic by Farouk Abdel Wahab: 

</P>
<P>
	``Life is a tragedy and the world is a boring stage. The play is  
tragic, but, curiously enough, the actors are clowns. The message, 
strangely, is sad not because it is sad in itself but because, 
meant to be taken seriously to the extreme, it produces a totally 
farcical effect. And, because for the most part we cannot laugh at 
the thwarting of our hopes, we cry and the tears blind us to the 
truth: we think the play is a tragedy when in fact it is a farce. 
</P>
<P>
	``So said Hamlet, and Naguib Mahfouz, and poor Ahmad Akif, who  
read all the classics of Arabic belles lettres but didn't become a 
writer or find a beloved.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The door of the plane opened and I saw the silence.  
</P>
<P>
	``A rare sensation: to feel the cool air-conditioning at your  
back as your chest and face meet the sun before you've even left 
the door of the plane. The person behind me pushed me gently and I 
took the first step. The moment I descended the few steps and my 
feet touched the ground, I felt that I, the earth and the air had 
become one thing: hot and empty.''

<HEADLINE> Editorial Roundup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers in the  
United States and abroad: 

</P>
<P>
	June 18  
</P>
<P>
	Albuquerque Journal, on NATO in Kosovo:  
</P>
<P>
	The tide of ethnic Albanians that flowed out of Kosovo's cities  
and towns to the hills and across the border is returning and a 
flood of Serbs fearful of reprisals is rolling the other direction. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO's involvement in Kosovo enters a new chapter -- and a more  
perilous one -- as troops move in to keep the two long-feuding 
factions apart. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO's campaign to bomb Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic  
back to the table earned NATO the tag ``Kosovo Liberation Army's 
air force,'' since all the explosives were aimed at the KLA's 
enemy. 
</P>
<P>
	The ground troops' first fight will be against the perception  
that NATO is there to pinion the Serbs' arms while the Kosovars 
take their brutal turn. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The week started off with returning Kosovars lavishing praise on  
NATO and kissing American flags. That honeymoon can't last as NATO 
troops attempt to separate KLA members from their ordnance and 
otherwise stand between Albanians and their inclination for 
retribution. 
</P>
<P>
	To keep the peace, NATO has to patrol both sides of the street --  
a much tougher, more dangerous job than high-altitude, low-casualty 
assault on one side. 

</P>
<P>
	June 19  
</P>
<P>
	The Palm Beach (Fla.) Post, on NATO's war ally:  
</P>
<P>
	Russia isn't NATO's only rival in Kosovo. Another -- the Kosovo  
Liberation Army -- is potentially more difficult. ... 
</P>
<P>
	This week, British troops arrested five KLA rebels for killing a  
Serb near Kosovo's capital of Pristina. U.S. Marines arrested six 
KLA rebels who refused to turn in weapons. But just as NATO troops 
can't be everywhere to prevent departing Serbs from burning and 
killing as they leave, NATO troops have been unable to occupy all 
villages and areas before the KLA moves in, often with the promise 
of establishing civilian rather than military order. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Many KLA fighters carry memories of murdered sisters, brothers,  
mothers and fathers. While NATO was bombing to stop those murders, 
KLA fighters and NATO were de facto allies. In making peace, 
however, NATO can't tolerate an ally bent on revenge. Commanders 
may find out that hard-core KLA rebels won't tolerate an ally who 
isn't. ... 

</P>
<P>
	June 21.  
</P>
<P>
	The Index-Journal, Greenwood, S.C., on future of Slobodan  
Milosevic: 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton ought to get a lot of support on the question  
of rebuilding Serbia (Yugoslavia). 
</P>
<P>
	He says flatly that the United States will provide no cash for  
that purpose as long as President Slobodan Milosevic runs that 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	As long as Yugoslavia is in the hands of a war criminal, that  
will hold true, Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	There should be no question about Milosevic's status, and he  
should be brought to justice. But let's not hold our breath until 
that happens. We've been there, done that too many times. This time 
there should be no waffling. 

</P>
<P>
	June 21  
</P>
<P>
	Star Tribune of Minneapolis, on debt relief for poor countries:  
</P>
<P>
	Meeting in Cologne, Germany, last weekend to discuss world  
prosperity, President Clinton and leaders of the other ``G8'' 
industrial countries have heard from all the top economists. But 
the best idea on the table comes from a different source -- a 
collection of unlikely experts that includes Pope John Paul, 
Archbishop Desmond Tutu and the rock singer Bono. 
</P>
<P>
	These voices have joined a London-based coalition called Jubilee  
2000 to urge a radical economic nostrum: debt relief for the 
world's poorest nations. It's so radical that it's simple. The rich 
nations should quit their temporizing and embrace it. 
</P>
<P>
	In their efforts to industrialize and catch up to the wealthy  
North, poor nations from Mali to Malaysia borrowed billions of 
dollars during the 1970s and 1980s. Many of these investments paid 
off; nations such as South Korea and Indonesia are moving into the 
world's middle class. 
</P>
<P>
	But many investments did not pay off, and some of the world's  
poorest nations are now stuck repaying millions of dollars to 
commercial banks and foreign governments even while their citizens 
starve and die. ... 

</P>
<P>
	June 17  
</P>
<P>
	South County Journal, Kent, Wash., on Russia and Kosovo:  
</P>
<P>
	We're not sure what the Russians are up to in Kosovo, but we do  
know it is better to have them part of any solution than sulking on 
the outside and becoming part of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians helped bring about the settlement and having their  
troops acting as peacekeepers will make it difficult for them to 
walk away from that deal. Their presence also helps those in the 
Kremlin who favor working with NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia knows it is an inconsequential player in European, let  
alone world, affairs. But that will not always be the case. One day 
Russia will revive, and when that happens, it will be better if 
Russia is tied into Europe, economically and politically. ... 

</P>
<P>
	June 19  
</P>
<P>
	Charleston (W.Va.) Daily Mail, on juvenile crime bill:  
</P>
<P>
	A flurry of legislative activity followed the horrific school  
shootings in Colorado's Columbine High School. The silliest move 
yet has to be passage by the House of Representatives of a bill to 
permit the Ten Commandments to be posted in schools and other 
government buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., a cheerleader for the measure, reportedly  
said that if the Ten Commandments had been posted at Columbine, the 
shootings would never have taken place. 
</P>
<P>
	That's either incredibly naive, or incredibly disingenuous. In  
fact, the boy who shot six of his fellow students in Barr's home 
state of Georgia last month had attended a church service the night 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	If controlling angry teenage boys were as simple as posting the  
Ten Commandments, parents might be well advised to tattoo the text, 
backward, on their sons' foreheads. That way the boys could read 
them every time they looked in the mirror. 
</P>
<P>
	All of which is not to cast aspersions on the Ten Commandments,  
which are remarkable in their succinct wisdom. If everyone observed 
them, the world would be a far better place. 
</P>
<P>
	But ... the Ten Commandments also are an inherently religious  
statement of values. The Constitution, which every congressman has 
sworn to uphold, prohibits the government from endorsing any 
religion. 
</P>
<P>
	No doubt most congressmen who voted for the bill realize this,  
but did so anyway in hopes of having something to show their 
constituents, who understandably are alarmed by school shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Too bad one of the commandments isn't ``Thou shalt not pander.''  

</P>
<P>
	June 19  
</P>
<P>
	The (Portland) Oregonian, on the juvenile crime package:  
</P>
<P>
	When the U.S. House's embarrassing dog's breakfast of a juvenile  
crime package collapsed under bipartisan disgust, it was clear why 
the honorables had voted to call on schools to post the Ten 
Commandments in their buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	In terms of a serious effort to deal with juvenile crime, this  
House didn't have a prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	From its beginnings as a measure that probably would have passed  
the House overwhelmingly, this package got worse on a daily basis. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., the posting of the Ten  
Commandments in Columbine High School would have prevented the 
shooting there entirely. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess that families in my district and across the country  
will rest easier this weekend,'' Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Colo., told 
the House sarcastically, ``knowing that we're posting the Ten 
Commandments in schools and passing a youth guns amendment written 
by the NRA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, they'll probably rest easier knowing that the House  
rejected the watery gun control package. Possibly, over this long 
weekend, congressmen will hear another commandment from their 
constituents: 
</P>
<P>
	On the issues of children's lives, thou shalt not posture.

	The Advocate, Baton Rouge, La., on school respect bill:  
</P>
<P>
	Like a lot of other bills that have passed the Legislature  
during the current session, a bill to require students to address 
school personnel with respect is little or nothing more than ``feel 
good'' legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	(The bill) ... requires students to refer to school employees as  
``sir'' and ``ma'am.'' It covers school employees from principals 
to teachers to janitors. Although it applies only to elementary 
schools at first, it would gradually expand to cover middle and 
high schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Do we think students should show respect to adults? Of course.  
</P>
<P>
	Do we think its a matter for inclusion in state law books? Of  
course not. 
</P>
<P>
	It's like a lot of other bills the Legislature passed this  
session: Bills that make the lawmakers, and perhaps some of the 
more gullible of their constituents, feel good, but actually 
accomplish little or nothing except to clutter up the state's law 
books. ...

	The Daily Standard, Celina, Ohio, on OSU treatment of athlete:  
</P>
<P>
	A national sports publication has blown the whistle on a  
situation at the Ohio State University that makes a national 
embarrassment out of what previously had been only a state 
embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
	Sports Illustrated magazine reported in a recent edition that it  
had received anonymous letters, purportedly signed by university 
faculty members, accusing the university of giving preferential 
treatment to former star linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Interestingly, Ohio State president William Kirwan confirmed the  
allegations contained in the letter while disagreeing with the 
conclusion that Katzenmoyer got special treatment. All students are 
given the same sort of consideration, Kirwan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Who says Ohio State's academic integrity has become a joke? This  
school's academic integrity is in fine shape ... especially if you 
are a pro football prospect in danger of academic ineligibility the 
same year your team is the preseason pick to win a national 
championship.

</P>
<P>
	With his strong speech ... filled with praise for the Slovene  
democracy and blame for the tyranny imposed by (Yugoslav President 
Slobodan) Milosevic on the Serbs, President Clinton definitively 
turned the page as to the West's cowardly actions since the fall of 
the Berlin Wall, to the more or less declared hostility towards the 
new sovereign states of the Balkans, combined with indulgence and 
compromise when confronting Milosevic's Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Today the Balkan policy of the United States is directed towards  
independence: already fully implemented in Slovenia and Croatia, it 
should, according to Washington, be restructured and supported in 
Bosnia, reinforced in Macedonia, and at last extended to Kosovo and 
Montenegro. Serbia, guilty of ten years of decay and massacres, 
losing its Kosovar appendix and Montenegrin satellite, should 
abandon the myth of its regional power and see itself return to 
mono-ethnic dimensions.

	Javier Solana, head of NATO, formally put an end to the air  
strikes which, after 11 weeks of destruction and wear, brought 
Slobodan Milosevic onto one knee. 
</P>
<P>
	For NATO, the military victory is complete. And the departure  
... of the last Serb soldier of an army defeated without having 
really fought, justifies a strategy -- so criticized -- based solely 
on air attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Another step has been taken in the process of re-establishing  
peace in Yugoslavia, without our really knowing which road the 
international community intends to take now. 
</P>
<P>
	Does it know itself?  
</P>

	Can it realistically impose any directions without marking out  
the terrain? ...

</P>
<P>
	The Daily Telegraph, London, on British-Chinese relations:  
</P>
<P>
	The government has been eager to take credit for NATO successes  
in the Balkans, but seeks to evade responsibility for errors made 
along the way. In a stunningly caddish remark in Beijing this week, 
Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary, asserted: 
``American bombs which hit the Chinese embassy have nothing to do 
with Britain.'' It is unlikely that Mr. Byers' effort to ingratiate 
himself with China's hard-headed leaders will win many fresh orders 
for British industry, but such comments from a Cabinet minister 
certainly give umbrage to the leaders of our closest ally across 
the Atlantic. If the American action had been intentional, there 
might have been some excuse for violating NATO's code of collective 
responsibility. Byers tried to dissociate Britain from the embassy 
bombing by claiming that individual NATO countries picked their own 
targets separately. This is breathtakingly dishonest.

	Asahi Shimbun, Tokyo, on debt relief program for poor countries:  
</P>
<P>
	... The leaders of the G-8 major countries waived all repayments  
of loans in official development assistance and largely increased 
the number of countries benefiting from the write-offs. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan, a large creditor nation in yen loans, resisted the plan  
on the grounds that nations should repay their debts. 
</P>
<P>
	But Japan's opposition was overcome by the drive waged by social  
democratic governments in Europe, which were backed by 
nongovernmental organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Larger questions remain. How will poor countries take advantage  
of the reduction in their indebtedness and how will they invite 
capital in the private sector of their economies? Unless such 
questions are discussed and answered, the write-offs could drain 
the debtor nations' self-reliance. ...

<P>
	The Straits Times, Singapore, on India and Pakistan:  
</P>
<P>
	There are reasons to suppose India and Pakistan would show a  
healthier respect for each other after their matching nuclear 
tests. It was thought neither side would act rashly in the pursuit 
of nationalistic aims as they now had more or less equal means of 
delivering a blow. Moreover, Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari 
Vajpayee's recent visit to Pakistan was said to have built a 
stabilizer into their turbulent relationship. How naive. 
</P>
<P>
	How wrong to assume goodwill would prevail in a subcontinent  
marked by race and religious animosities ever since partition in 
1947. The latest display of ill temper over disputed Kashmir may 
have been intended by both countries to flex muscles precisely on 
account of their nuclear status.

<P>
	El Pais, Madrid, Spain, on Amnesty International report:  
</P>
<P>
	The annual Amnesty International (AI) report about the state of  
human rights in the world continues to be shocking, more so because 
in 1998 important advances were registered in the fight against 
impunity. 
</P>
<P>
	The detention in London of ex-Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet  
has been without doubt one of these, as was the agreement to create 
an International Criminal Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The crop of abuses and violations in the 144 countries singled  
out is abundant. Spain is one of those democratic countries in 
which torture cases and police abuse continue. 
</P>
<P>
	Human rights violations in non-democratic countries are many  
times worse and especially cruel. 
</P>
<P>
	But the survival of the death penalty ... in democratic systems  
constitutes a bad example for non-democratic regimes. The clearest 
example of this case is the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation that has made the defense of human rights one of its  
foreign policy banners, of which it is proud ... shows a grave 
deficit in this area. ...

<HEADLINE> Dan Quayle Expands Attack on Values </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Vice President Dan Quayle is expanding  
his values attack on prime-time TV's Murphy Brown to include an 
entire decade -- the 1960s -- and its ``free drugs, free love, free 
lunch and freedom from responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the 52-year-old Quayle is part of that generation, he  
casts himself as the ``standard bearer'' for those of all ages who 
embrace the values of the World War II generation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican presidential candidate attacks the liberal values  
of the 1960s and an ``opinion elite'' of baby boomers in the media, 
universities and entertainment business who grew up during the 
decade and now are in positions of influence. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to pay a price for the excesses of the crowd that  
preached free drugs, free love, free lunch and freedom from 
responsibility,'' the Republican presidential candidate writes in 
his new book, ``Worth Fighting For.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic  
front-runner for president, have ``embraced those who, since the 
1960s, have ceaselessly pounded away at honor, duty, country and 
the rule of law,'' he writes. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle, whose presidential candidacy has been in single digits  
in early polls, calls the next election a chance to ``reset our 
moral compass.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He uses the book to outline his plans for a 30 percent,  
across-the-board tax cut, his anti-abortion stance, support for 
term limits and protection of the elderly from any benefit cuts. 
Campaign spokesman Jonathan Baron said Wednesday that Quayle was 
not available to discuss his book, which he said speaks for itself 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle writes that there are ``deep, if not irreconcilable  
differences between left and right on the issue of the country's 
core values.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Murphy Brown speech I gave in 1992 was notable because it  
clearly demonstrated that the divide existed,'' he writes. Murphy 
Brown, a TV journalist portrayed by actress Candice Bergen, gave 
birth out of wedlock in the series. Quayle criticized the use of an 
out-of-wedlock birth as a plot in a situation comedy. 
</P>
<P>
	He decries the ``new aristocracy'' of the ``elite news media,  
the Hollywood crowd, the tenured faculty of elite institutions of 
higher education, the federal judiciary and the radical feminist 
movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Their numbers are small, but their influence is staggering,''  
Quayle writes. 
</P>
<P>
	He notes that Gore has praised the television series ``Ellen,''  
for ``in his word, 'forcing' Americans to view a positive portrayal 
of a lesbian relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Quayle has declined comment on actress Ellen DeGeneres'  
gay sexual orientation, he cites Gore's comment as evidence of the 
influence wielded by the ``opinion elite.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While calling the civil rights movement of the 1960s a ``noble  
effort,'' Quayle adds it was soon overshadowed by ``excesses wholly 
unrelated to the struggle for civil rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The drug use of the '60s was ``the wedge that pried open the  
country to the routine use of drugs.'' And ``the rejection of 
traditional sexual morality ... robbed an army of children of the 
chance to live in two-parent households ... even as it unleashed a 
plague of sexually transmitted diseases from herpes to AIDS to 
hepatitis B.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The best way to counter the erosion of American values, Quayle  
writes, is to use the presidential ``bully pulpit'' and appoint 
``cultural critics of ability and intellect'' to key positions like 
secretary of education and chairmen of the National Endowment of 
the Humanities and the Arts.

<HEADLINE> Senate Kills Steel Quota Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation that would restrict foreign steel  
shipments is dead. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. steel industry did not obtain a majority, much less the  
60 votes needed to clear a procedural hurdle on the quota bill. The 
Senate voted 57-42 against a motion Tuesday to restrict debate and 
supporters do not plan to try again. 
</P>
<P>
	``This issue is unfortunately dead,'' said Sen. Rick Santorum,  
R-Pa., who was in charge of garnering Republican support for the 
quota measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Santorum said lawmakers now will regroup to figure out other  
ways to help the industry. He said they may try to strengthen a 
bill the Senate Finance Committee approved last week to address the 
steel industry's long-term health. Quota supporters complained that 
bill does not address the industry's plight in the short run. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. steel industry sought quotas to combat low-priced steel  
imports it blames for thousands of layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports reached record highs in 1998 in the wake of the Asian  
economic crisis, which reduced demand for steel abroad and forced 
foreign producers to look for a market in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration lobbied against the bill, and several  
senators expressed concerns about its effects on the national 
economy. Opponents say the quotas violate international trade 
agreements and could prompt other countries to cut off their 
markets to U.S. exports. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bill will kill jobs. This bill will start a trade war,''  
said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas. ``Since we are the greatest 
beneficiary of international trade, we will lose more than anyone 
else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The issue divided Senate Democrats, many of whom were personally  
contacted by Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Commerce Secretary 
William Daley and urged to reject quotas. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters had counted on getting the votes of all 45 Democrats  
and 15 of the Republicans behind quotas. They did get 15 
Republicans but persuaded only 27 Democrats to join them. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley praised the Senate for rejecting legislation that he  
considered ``bad for the economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he warned that foreign producers should not take the Senate  
vote as a sign that the United States will permit illegal pricing. 
He said the administration already has imposed sanctions short of 
quotas to address those practices. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill's passage could have caused difficulties for Vice  
President Al Gore as he tries to court organized labor for his 
presidential run next year. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton had threatened a veto of the bill, which the  
House passed in March by 289-141. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton called the vote ``a reaffirmation of America's  
commitment to open markets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Quota legislation was the wrong approach and would have  
weakened our economy and undermined our ability to tear down unfair 
trade barriers in foreign countries that hurt our workers, farmers 
and companies,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., said Congress could try to modify  
trade laws to make it easier for domestic companies to prove injury 
in certain trade complaints in the future. But he said much of the 
initiative to address the steel industry's current woes must come 
directly from the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The test on quotas followed Senate passage Friday of a bill that  
would create a $1.5 billion loan program for U.S. steel, oil and 
gas producers hurt by fallen prices.

<HEADLINE> E. Timor Vote Delay Sparks Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- East Timor's independence referendum  
had to be delayed two weeks to improve security and give the United 
Nations more time to prepare for the vote, a U.N. official said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to concerns about violence, the United Nations was  
not prepared for voter registration, originally scheduled to start 
Monday, said David Wimhurst, spokesman for the U.N. Assistance 
Mission in East Timor, or UNAMET. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will give everybody a chance to deal with security  
concerns, allow internally displaced people to return to their 
homes, and give us time to fully deploy,'' Wimhurst told The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The referendum will allow East Timorese to decide between  
independence and autonomy within Indonesia. It had been planned for 
Aug. 8 under an agreement involving the United Nations, Indonesia 
and Portugal. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan announced Tuesday it had been  
delayed to Aug. 21 or 22. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said today that security  
should not be used as an excuse to delay the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't believe there should be a delay,'' Alatas told  
reporters. ``We believe the security situation is constantly 
improving and we are quite sure that by the time of Aug. 8, or far 
before it, the security situation will be fully conducive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alatas said that if a delay is necessary, it should be because  
of technical reasons from a series of logistical holdups. 
</P>
<P>
	``If that is the reason for the delay, we can be, of course,  
rational about it,'' he said. ``But please, then use that reason 
truthfully and not only, or solely, blame the security situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leandro Isaac, a pro-independence leader among those who signed  
a peace pact Friday in Jakarta, denounced the Indonesian security 
apparatus as well as UNAMET for the delay. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both ... should be held responsible,'' he said. ``If possible,  
they should be disciplined, because any delay would only bring more 
suffering to the East Timorese.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first group of 70 volunteers, who will register voters and  
help supervise the election, arrived today in East Timor's capital, 
Dili. More will arrive each week for the next four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 248 international police advisers and 600 civilian  
officials will oversee the ballot. The first police advisers 
arrived Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	With the approach of the vote, violence has escalated in the  
half-island territory, a former Portuguese colony that Indonesia 
invaded in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Amnesty International says at least 34 people have been killed  
since May 5 and claims a government-backed terror campaign against 
independence supporters could jeopardize the referendum's success. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the peace accord signed Friday, pro- and anti-independence  
rival factions pledged to lay down their weapons by July 5. But 
they have yet to negotiate how they will disarm and withdraw their 
forces from the territory's interior. A meeting is scheduled for 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report Tuesday to the U.N. Security Council, Annan said  
pro-Indonesia militias, believed by many observers to be operating 
with the backing of the Indonesian army, have carried out attacks 
and intimidated the population in East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has denied that soldiers are playing favorites.  
</P>
<P>
	Florentino Sarmento, chairman of the local National Commission  
on Human Rights, a pro-autonomy group, denounced UNAMET, saying the 
situation had been peaceful during the nation's June 7 
parliamentary election. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on that, I think this postponement is caused more by the  
incompetence of UNAMET,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Office Depot To Warn About Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- If a brand-new computer fails at the  
turn-of-the-century, who's to blame? The manufacturer for making a 
faulty product, the retailer for selling it, or the customers for 
buying it? 
</P>
<P>
	At least one major electronics seller -- Office Depot -- has  
agreed to do its part to warn consumers that no matter how new 
their computer or piece of software is, it may not work properly 
after Dec. 31, 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The Delray Beach, Fla.-based retailer, in settling a lawsuit  
Wednesday, said it would post signs in its computer aisles, 
customer service desks and cash registers urging people to 
investigate whether their systems are Y2K compliant. 
</P>
<P>
	Office Depot also said it would provide manufacturer's Web  
addresses and phone numbers to help consumers inquire about 
products, include Y2K information in their Sunday advertisements 
and provide customers with an informational brochure. 
</P>
<P>
	Six other retailers also were targeted in the lawsuit, filed by  
Tom Johnson, a Concord swim coach who got frustrated when store 
clerks couldn't say whether their new products were Y2K compatible. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed last January, alleged that Circuit City,  
Fry's Electronics, The Good Guys, CompUSA, Staples, OfficeMax and 
Office Depot's lack of notice about Y2K problems is a violation of 
California's Unfair Competition Law. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many consumers believe that the Y2K problem will only affect  
older products and mainframe computers or large corporate 
networks,'' said Johnson's lawyer, Rich Ergo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many products sold today are not compliant. Office Depot has  
stepped up to the plate to help disabuse the public of these 
misconceptions,'' Ergo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many computers originally programmed to recognize only the last  
two digits of a year may not work properly beginning Jan. 1, 2000, 
when some machines will assume it is 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	Ergo begins court-mandated settlement talks on July 15 with the  
six other companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody had to be the first,'' said Office Depot attorney  
Timothy Crudo. ``Y2K is a thing that potentially affects everyone 
and we've all got to pitch in to make sure we minimize the 
impact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crudo said he didn't know whether Office Depot would expand its  
educational campaign outside its 100 stores in California or how 
much efforts would cost. A company spokesman did not return a call 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed in Contra Costa County Superior Court, is the  
first to target retailers. Most lawsuits have gone after software 
manufacturers for selling products that will allegedly become 
defective by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Judges in two states, including California, have rejected most  
of those claims because no consumer has actually been damaged yet. 
Ergo argued that buyers of new computers are already suffering, 
because they might be forced to pay for millennium bug fixes later.

<HEADLINE> Final Microsoft Witness Testifies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The final witness in the Microsoft antitrust  
trial testified today that the software giant can't be a monopolist 
because it faces competition from promising upstart rivals in the 
nation's high-tech industry. 
</P>
<P>
	But economist Richard Schmalensee, in his next-to-last day of  
testimony, acknowledged that Microsoft's dominant Windows operating 
system will be ``the only viable alternative'' for most computer 
makers in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
	``From everything I've seen, for some number of years, while  
there will be many ways to access the Internet, a lot of work will 
be done on (Windows) desktops using desktop equipment,'' 
Schmalensee testified under cross-examination by government 
attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmalensee described new technologies -- including non-Microsoft  
handheld computers, a new generation of software running across the 
Internet and the rival Linux operating system -- that he said make 
Microsoft too worried to be the entrenched monopolist the 
government describes. 
</P>
<P>
	The argument is important to Microsoft because it wants to show  
that other companies believe they can make money competing against 
the software giant and its flagship Windows software. 
</P>
<P>
	``Saying there are no viable commercial alternatives to Windows  
is less true than it was six months ago,'' Schmalensee said. 
</P>
<P>
	But when the top Justice Department lawyer in the case, David  
Boies, pressed Schmalensee, the economist couldn't offer details 
about the popularity of Linux computers, the booming development of 
new Internet-based software, or even when those types of Web 
programs will become widespread. 
</P>
<P>
	``In relative terms, there will be a shift in activity where the  
computing occurs,'' Schmalensee said. ``I'm not a prophet. One 
extrapolates in this business with some risk. It could happen. It 
could happen soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, Boies opened his courtroom challenge by  
eliciting testimony that Schmalensee was paid hundreds of thousands 
of dollars in consulting fees, along with an admission that recent 
evidence he prepared for court was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Boies confronted Schmalensee with two charts the economist  
created showing increasing distribution since 1996 of rival 
Internet software from Netscape Communications Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	But as Boies pointed out, the numbers in Schmalensee's charts --  
based on the same data -- don't match. A visibly rattled Schmalensee 
acknowledged that the comparison ``suggests a difficulty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It does more than suggests a difficulty, doesn't it?'' Boies  
asked. ``They cannot be reconciled, can they?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Boies, one of these is wrong,'' Schmalensee said.  
</P>
<P>
	The government also pressed Schmalensee about how much money he  
had earned from Microsoft. Schmalensee, who charges $800 an hour as 
a consultant, said he wasn't sure but ultimately agreed it was 
``more likely than not'' that Microsoft has paid him more than 
$250,000 during the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmalensee, an acting dean at the Massachusetts Institute of  
Technology, also acknowledged earning a $200,000 annual bonus last 
year from National Economic Research Associates, his consulting 
firm, and a $100,000 bonus in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The aggressive questioning over Schmalensee's finances followed  
Microsoft's courtroom accusation earlier this month that an 
economist testifying for the government, Franklin Fisher, is a 
major shareholder and chairman of a consulting company that could 
benefit if Microsoft is ruled a monopolist. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a chance I wouldn't even have gone into that if we  
hadn't gone into Professor Fisher's payments,'' Boies said outside 
court.

<HEADLINE> Black Lawyer Defends Va. KKK Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HILLSVILLE, Va. (AP) -- An all-white jury convicted a Ku Klux  
Klan leader of cross-burning Wednesday, rejecting claims by his 
black ACLU lawyer that he was legally exercising his right to free 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury took 25 minutes to convict Barry Black of Johnstown,  
Pa., of violating a Virginia law against burning a cross to 
intimidate others. 
</P>
<P>
	Black, 51, could get up to five years in prison.  
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Black, an imperial wizard with the  
International Keystone Knights of the Klan, led a rally in which 18 
robed and hooded Klansmen held torches as they stood around a 
burning cross. The August gathering was on private property with 
the owner's consent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Klan leader's lawyer, David Baugh of the American Civil  
Liberties Union, argued: ``The cross was burned as a part of their 
ceremony, not because they want to intimidate anyone. Mr. Black has 
the right to express, by sign or gesture, any feelings he has.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baugh told the jury he knows the Klan hates blacks, but ``in  
America we have the right to hate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Greg Goad said Black has every right to freedom of  
speech. ``What is different here is that nobody has the right to 
intimidate others,'' Goad said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Black indicated his intent to intimidate to a deputy on  
the way to jail. ``Mr. Black said, `When is the white man going to 
stand up to the blacks and Mexicans in this neighborhood?''' the 
prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than 1 percent of the 26,000 residents of Carroll County in  
the mountains of southwestern Virginia are black. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the case went to trial, Baugh said he found the KKK's  
views offensive but took the Klan leader on as a client because 
``we cannot afford any erosion of the First Amendment.''

<HEADLINE> Report: China Eyes Securities Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- China is considering raising the  
penalties for securities-trading offenses to include jail time and 
heavy fines, a state newspaper said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The move by the Chinese legislature is part of a crackdown on  
economic crimes and rampant stock market abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Insider trading, price manipulation and other offenses that now  
are punished by fines or the loss of trading privileges would be 
given criminal status, the China Securities News said. 
</P>
<P>
	China's fledgling, poorly regulated securities industry is a  
hotbed of insider trading and other abuses that have badly damaged 
investor confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	In an unusual move to reassure investors, leading brokerages  
published a letter Tuesday in major Chinese financial newspapers 
promising not to cheat customers.

<HEADLINE> End of 'Marriage Tax' Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fans of country music, talk radio and  
Christian stations are being wooed by opponents of the so-called 
marriage penalty that causes many two-earner couples to pay more in 
income taxes than if they were single. 
</P>
<P>
	A two-week radio ad campaign in 17 congressional districts,  
including that of House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., urges 
listeners to call their representative and ``tell them to stop the 
marriage tax.'' Most members targeted by the conservative Family 
Research Council in the campaign serve on the House's tax-writing 
Ways and Means panel. 
</P>
<P>
	The 60-second spots began airing Monday and continue through  
July 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our government should help people provide security for their  
children, not jeopardize that security just to get more tax 
revenue,'' said Tom Atwood, a vice president at the 
Washington-based organization. 
</P>
<P>
	House and Senate Republicans are preparing to release the  
details of a 10-year, $778 billion tax-cut plan next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Pro-family and anti-tax groups fear that, with so many tax-cut  
ideas vying for slots in the GOP legislation, only a watered-down 
version of their proposal to eliminate the marriage penalty will 
survive. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, 
R-Texas, was holding a hearing today on the tax code's treatment of 
families, including the marriage penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the House passed an increase in the standard  
deduction for married couples filing jointly. That change would 
cost about $4 billion a year and would get rid of about $240 of the 
estimated $1,400-a-year penalty the tax code slaps on 21 million 
married couples. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, eliminating the entire penalty carries an estimated  
price tag of $340 billion over five years. That would take up much 
of what House Republicans have made available for a plan that is 
likely to include other tax cuts such as elimination of estate 
taxes, lowering of capital gains taxes and business tax reduction. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, supporters said public distaste for the disparity is on  
their side. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've built tremendous momentum,'' said Rep. Jerry Weller,  
R-Ill., sponsor of a bill with 230 co-sponsors -- including about a 
dozen Democrats -- to fix the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Married couples in which both spouses earn roughly similar  
amounts are the most affected. Households where one spouse brings 
home significantly more gain a marriage ``bonus'' averaging about 
$1,300. 
</P>
<P>
	Weller's bill would get at the marriage penalty two ways:  
</P>
<P>
	--Immediately increase the standard deduction for married couples  
from $6,900 to $8,300, twice the amount single people receive. 
</P>
<P>
	--Phase in an increase in the 15 percent income tax bracket for  
married couples from $41,200 to $49,300 -- again, twice $24,650 
bracket for singles. That would give married couples an additional 
$8,100 subject to the lower 15 percent rate instead of the 28 
percent rate.

<HEADLINE> Cisneros' Ex-Lover Admits Lies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A witness central to the government's  
conspiracy case against former Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros 
acknowledged on the stand today that she had lied repeatedly to 
federal agents investigating her ex-lover. 
</P>
<P>
	Under cross-examination from Cisneros lawyer Brendan Sullivan,  
Linda Jones conceded again and again that she had lied to the FBI 
and Internal Revenue Service about the authenticity of tape 
recordings she secretly made of her phone conversations with 
Cisneros as their relationship soured. She later gave the tapes to 
the government. 
</P>
<P>
	She also admitted lying under oath multiple times during a 1994  
deposition in her civil breach-of-contract lawsuit against 
Cisneros. 
</P>
<P>
	``You were lying here generally to prosecute a claim for money  
against Henry Cisneros,'' Sullivan said regarding the deposition. 
``You were desperate for money, weren't you?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Replied Ms. Jones: ``Yes, sir.''  
</P>
<P>
	The defense also contended that Ms. Jones, who is serving a  
prison sentence for her misrepresentations to the government, is 
continuing to lie. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to bring in witnesses to say she is lying today  
from the witness stand,'' said Cisneros lawyer Barry Simon. 
</P>
<P>
	After a day of listening to the litany of lies Ms. Jones  
acknowledged telling over the years, U.S. District Judge Stanley 
Sporkin expressed his amazement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm astounded when I sit here and listen to what has happened  
in this case. I guess there are people in this country who don't 
know how to tell the truth,'' the judge said. ``What I have to 
determine is: Is she telling the truth in front of me?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The attempt by Cisneros' legal team to chip away at Ms. Jones'  
credibility and paint her as an opportunist came during a pretrial 
hearing pivotal to both the defense and the government's special 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is the admissibility of the tapes at Cisneros' trial,  
scheduled to begin in September. Prosecutors want to introduce 34 
of the 88 tapes. 
</P>
<P>
	The tapes are crucial to the prosecution's contention that  
Cisneros conspired with Ms. Jones and two aides to conceal from the 
FBI during his Cabinet background check the size of what 
prosecutors call his ``hush money'' payments to her. 
</P>
<P>
	All 88 tapes are copies of originals that Ms. Jones destroyed.  
The defense contends they constitute ``tampered'' evidence because 
they are copies and because Ms. Jones altered some to delete 
passages where she threatened Cisneros, something she has admitted. 
</P>
<P>
	Sporkin is expected to rule after the pretrial hearing concludes  
at week's end. It began Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In her third day on the stand, Ms. Jones said she secretly taped  
Cisneros after becoming worried he would abandon his commitment to 
support her financially. He began the payments after their 
extramarital affair became public in 1988, jeopardizing her 
marriage and career as a political fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, she testified she altered ``five or six'' of the 88  
tapes after lawyers told her that her threats could prove legally 
troublesome, and she re-recorded all 88 to ensure similar sound 
quality, destroying the originals. 
</P>
<P>
	Under cross-examination, Ms. Jones acknowledged she  
misrepresented the tapes as originals to the FBI, IRS and 
Independent Counsel David Barrett, who is investigating Cisneros. 
</P>
<P>
	Those misrepresentations led to prosecution. She pleaded guilty  
last year to fraud, conspiracy, money laundering and obstruction 
and is serving a 3 1/2-year prison sentence. She could be freed sooner 
based on her cooperation with the government at trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros, HUD secretary from 1993 to 1996, was indicted in  
December 1997 on 18 felony counts of conspiracy, obstructing 
justice and making false statements to the FBI. He pleaded 
innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	He acknowledged providing financial support, but prosecutors  
contend he lied by telling the FBI he never paid her more than 
$2,500 at one time nor more than $10,000 annually. The indictment 
alleges he paid her more than $264,000 between 1990 and 1993, in 
installments as high as $15,000.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Heroes Say Scandal Hurts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With eight gold medals between them, Harrison  
Dillard and John Naber know what it takes to compete in the 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	In this day of commercialization, that includes money to train.  
</P>
<P>
	And that's why Dillard, with four golds in track, and Naber,  
with four golds in swimming, say athletes receive the brunt of the 
Olympic bribery scandal created by their leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like in 1980 with the boycott,'' Dillard said Wednesday,  
referring to the White House-led boycott of the Moscow Games. ``It 
only affected the athletes who couldn't go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing a Capitol Hill crowd on International Olympic Day,  
Naber said time is running out for some competitors waiting for 
donations and sponsorships delayed by the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``While major change is needed, it must be noted that it is the  
athletes who are paying the price for the deeds of others,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Naber and Dillard were among more than 100 U.S. Olympians who  
turned out for the ceremony, which marked the founding the modern 
Olympic movement 105 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony is part of the U.S. Olympic Committee's effort to  
shift the focus from the Salt Lake City scandal to the athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a few falters and a few stumbles,'' Sen. Ben  
Nighthorse Campbell, a Colorado Republican who was captain of the 
U.S. Olympic judo team in 1964, told more than 100 spectators. ``A 
few people gave us a black eye, but that's just a bump in the road. 
The U.S. Olympic team has done its best to reverse from that 
falter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those on hand ranged from 76-year-old Horace Ashenfelter, a gold  
medalist in the 3,000-meter steeplechase in 1952, to Dominique 
Dawes, part of the gold-medal women's gymnastics team in 1992 when 
she was 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 111 athletes who took part, 47 had won a total of 74 gold  
medals. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are my heroes,'' said Herb Douglas, the 1948 long jump  
bronze medalist. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas, a business leader who started the annual Jesse Owens  
Award for athletic excellence, sat at a table with a group of 
fellow Olympians who counted 10 gold medals among them -- 
basketball's Ray Lumpp (1948) and track stars Dillard (four golds, 
1948-52), Charlie Jenkins (two, 1956), Madeline Manning Mims (one, 
1968) and Lindy Remigino (two, 1952). 
</P>
<P>
	They and others said it was important to remember that the  
scandal did not involve athletes, that relatively few stars made 
money from Olympic glory and that the lure of the games had nothing 
to go with personal gain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love the Olympics,'' said Hilary Smart, a yachting gold  
medalist in 1948 whose father also was an Olympic sailing champion. 
``I was one of the amateur guys. I never was looking for money from 
it. Who cared?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Naber, a star at the 1976 Games and now a TV sports commentator,  
said he and his colleagues were ``ordinary people who accomplished 
extraordinary things. It is that which inspires others as they 
watch us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The head of the USOC's alumni organization, Naber urged fans and  
corporations not to allow the scandal to stop the support for the 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Capitol stage was limited to athletes. The only high-ranking  
officials allowed to share the spotlight among those donning red, 
white and blue windbreakers were those who once starred as 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great fun,'' said Anita DeFrantz, a vice president of he  
International Olympic Committee but first a bronze medalist in 
rowing at the 1976 Games. ``I've seen some folks I've admired. It 
reminds us of what we are about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Ryun, the former champion miler who now is a congressman  
from Kansas, was the 1,500-meter silver medalist in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	``I urge all Americans and all American corporations to resume  
their support of America's Olympic team,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Cavs' Embry Elected To Hall of Fame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- A few weeks ago, Wayne Embry looked down the  
list of nominees for the Basketball Hall of Fame and did a double 
take when he got to the second name -- his own. 
</P>
<P>
	``I looked at it and I was surprised,'' Embry said. ``And I  
said, `Wow!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Embry, who in 1971 became the first black general manager in NBA  
history, got another surprise Wednesday when he was elected to the 
Basketball Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	The 62-year-old Embry, the Cleveland Cavaliers' president and  
chief operating officer, was elected for his contributions to 
basketball as an executive. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had to rely on playing ability to get in, I wouldn't be  
here right now,'' Embry joked during a news conference at Gund 
Arena. ``I could set a pick. I'd set a pick and then roll.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Entering the Hall of Fame along with Embry are Kevin McHale, the  
long-armed forward from the Boston Celtics; John Thompson, the 
combative Georgetown coach; Billie Moore, the first women's coach 
to lead two schools to national championships; and the late Fred 
Zollner, the NBA pioneer who owned the Fort Wayne and Detroit 
Pistons. The five will be inducted Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Embry, who has been a Hall of Fame trustee for years, said he  
was overwhelmed when he received the call at home Tuesday night 
from Springfield, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was emotional last night, and I'm emotional today,'' Embry  
said. ``To be elected into a distinct group of those who have 
played the game and coached the game and contributed to the game is 
just overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I looked at the list of nominees, I knew I was in good  
company,'' he said. ``And to be one of the five elected makes me 
feel really honored.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Embry was a five-time All-Star in an 11-year NBA playing career  
with the Cincinnati Royals, Boston Celtics and Milwaukee Bucks. He 
retired after the 1968-69 season, and two years later the Bucks 
made him their GM, the first black general manager in professional 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was all of 32 years old at the time,'' he said. ``I look  
back at that and am proud to say that, yes indeed, I am an 
African-American, but above all I'm a general manager. I never 
turned down a challenge and it was tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While with the Bucks, Embry pulled off one of the biggest trades  
in NBA history, sending Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to the Los Angeles 
Lakers for Elmore Smith, Dave Meyers, Brian Winters and Junior 
Bridgeman. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if it was his most trying time as a GM, Embry turned  
toward Cavs owner Gordon Gund and said laughing, ``No, there have 
been more trying than that. But that was a difficult one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Embry, twice named NBA exective of the year,  
was part of a front-office shakeup that saw Gund fire coach Mike 
Fratello and move Jim Paxson into Embry's GM spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great honor to follow him,'' said Paxson, busy  
interviewing coaching candidates and working out potential picks 
for next week's NBA draft. ``I hope I can do him proud as we go 
forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a day to celebrate and reflect for Embry, who wore the  
1968 NBA championship ring he won with the Celtics. He hasn't been 
able to win one during his 13 years with the Cavs, but said jewelry 
can never replace the relationships he has formed here. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the people that make this so special,'' he said. ``It's  
the letters and phone calls I get from former players thanking me 
for the inspiration I gave them. Working with people. It just 
pleases me to see people do well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Embry hasn't visited the Hall of Fame in years, and the next  
time he's there, part of him will be staying for good. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I go back for meetings, and I go into the hall I have  
this feeling, I don't know how to explain it,'' he said. ``It's 
overwhelming. Because you're standing there with greatness.''

<HEADLINE> Morning Is Hot New Time Slot in TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Assigned to a 5:30 a.m. newscast on New York's  
WNBC-TV, anchorman Maurice DuBois thought, only half-jokingly, that 
it was ``the end of the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Who was going to watch him at an hour only farmers could love?  
</P>
<P>
	Plenty of people, much to his surprise. Early morning represents  
the new -- and perhaps only -- boom time for television viewership as 
programmers wake up to the fact that more Americans are climbing 
out of bed early these days. 
</P>
<P>
	Local news broadcasts are coming on earlier and earlier and more  
people are tuning in. A little later, at 7 a.m., ABC, CBS and NBC 
news shows are getting the special attention of network executives 
who suddenly see them as cash cows. 
</P>
<P>
	America is becoming a nation of early risers, as people get a  
jump on the morning commute, work out in a gym or get the kids off 
to school. A study by the National Sleep Foundation this year found 
51 percent of Americans say they get up at 6 a.m. or earlier, an 
increase of 5 percent over 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a whole sociological shift,'' says early riser Jeff  
Zucker, executive producer of NBC's ``Today'' show. ``We see it in 
the way people are getting their news.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This spring, for the first time, more people watched the first  
half-hour of ``Today'' than one of the evening news programs, in 
this case ``CBS Evening News.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As recently as a decade ago, many local stations ran 30 minutes,  
maybe an hour, of local news before the network morning show. Some 
didn't even bother. That's changed. 
</P>
<P>
	A study of TV stations two years ago found that the  
fastest-growing time of day for viewership was 5:30 a.m., says Bob 
Papper, telecommunications professor at Ball State University in 
Muncie, Ind. He suspects that 5 a.m. has now supplanted that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if any stations are doing 4:30 news,'' Papper  
says, ``but I can guarantee that some are thinking about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The flip side, he says, is that ratings for local newscasts  
starting at 11 p.m. are slipping as people go to bed earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen Media Research has no national statistics to measure  
early morning viewership, since most of the programming is turned 
over to local stations. But some of the regional trends are as 
eye-opening as a strong cup of coffee. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York in 1990, Nielsen found 772,203 households had TV  
sets on at 6 a.m. By early 1999, that number had gone up to 1.6 
million, a 120 percent increase. Viewership during other parts of 
the day, particularly prime-time, has slipped during the same 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, WNBC-TV expanded its morning news show to 90 minutes,  
starting at 5:30 a.m. In September, the news will start at 5 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you build it, they will come,'' says Paula Madison, WNBC-TV  
vice president and news director. ``If we air a local newscast 
early, we find there is an audience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston's WBZ-TV, a CBS affiliate, debuted a three-hour morning  
show starting at 5 a.m. a year ago, after its research showed this 
was the best time of day in which to invest, spokeswoman Michele 
Walsh says. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not clear whether these stations are responding to a demand  
or creating one. Why didn't they try this before? 
</P>
<P>
	``It might be something as simple as we didn't think of it,''  
says Phyllis McGrady, the ABC executive who oversees ``Good Morning 
America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGrady, who worked on the show in the 1980s and recently  
returned, has noticed a difference in the audience. The morning 
shows used to be softer, considered strictly women's territory, but 
are now much newsier, she said. More men are watching. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're more in the habit of turning on the TV generally,'' Ball  
State's Papper says. ``Whether they are watching it is another 
issue. Maybe they're just listening to it, using it like a radio.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For TV executives, this trend has opened an important new source  
of revenue. It's virgin territory: Local stations can now sell ads 
for time periods not really used before. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the same bright financial picture at the networks. Last  
month, when advertisers bought commercial time for the upcoming 
fall shows, all three network morning shows saw sharp increases in 
advertising revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	At a time the networks are scrambling to make money, ``Today''  
racked up an impressive $100 million in profits for NBC last year. 
That's why ABC and CBS are investing heavily to cut in to NBC's 
dominance for that time period. 
</P>
<P>
	Diane Sawyer and Charles Gibson were brought in as ``Good  
Morning America'' hosts in January, and Bryant Gumbel starts at CBS 
in the fall. Both networks are also spending millions on new 
Manhattan studios. 
</P>
<P>
	``As prime-time television struggles for its identity,'' NBC's  
Zucker says, ``I believe the most competitive time slot in 
television is not 7 to 9 p.m., but 7 to 9 a.m.''

<HEADLINE> False Alarms in Fugitive Sightings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COBDEN, Ill. (AP) -- A woman in West Frankfort was sure it was  
Rafael Resendez-Ramirez who stole her purse. A gas station 
attendant more than 100 miles away said a man asking directions 
certainly looked like the suspected serial killer. 
</P>
<P>
	Although most, if not all, of the reported sightings of the  
fugitive have been false alarms, that hasn't made life any easier 
for Hispanic migrant residents and farm workers in southern 
Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	With a killer on the loose, migrants who come here to work the  
fruit orchards are getting uncomfortable stares and unsettling 
comparisons from fearful residents. 
</P>
<P>
	They don't like it, but they understand.  
</P>
<P>
	``We all look the same,'' said a Mexican worker at Flamm  
Orchards who only gave his first name, Evaristo. 
</P>
<P>
	Resendez-Ramirez has been charged with a double slaying June 15  
in the southern Illinois town of Gorham. He also is wanted in 
connection with five killings in Texas and has been tied to a 1997 
slaying in Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators believe he is making his way from town to town by  
hopping freight trains. 
</P>
<P>
	Police say the tattooed ex-convict frequently changes his  
appearance. But his common looks -- 5-foot-7, about 150 pounds, with 
black hair and brown eyes -- fit the description of thousands of 
Hispanic immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	In hilly, southwestern Union County, residents are familiar with  
Hispanics from the annual influx of about 1,000 migrant 
farmworkers, and there has been little panic, said Sheriff Jim 
Nash. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, even a well-tanned man walking the railroad tracks has  
been mistaken for Resendez-Ramirez, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The apparent paranoia seems to come from areas where Hispanic  
residents are less common. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, a West Frankfort woman said a 5-foot-7 man with  
brown skin, black hair and a mustache who stole her purse looked 
like Resendez-Ramirez. Police found no evidence that he was 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours before, a gas station attendant in Cahokia, more than 100  
miles to the northwest, told police she was reading a newspaper 
account of the search when a man resembling the suspect walked in 
asking for directions. 
</P>
<P>
	And in Sparta, about 30 miles north of Gorham, police Chief Alan  
Young said calls have poured in from residents expressing fear or 
reporting possible sightings. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're a Hispanic male right now, it's probably not safe to  
walk the streets,'' Young said. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, migrant worker Guadalupe Murillo -- who bears some  
resemblance to pictures of Resendez-Ramirez -- said he fears being 
mistaken for the killer. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's afraid that if he gets in the newspaper, people will  
think he is Ramirez,'' said Mexican immigrant Fidel Bartolo, who 
helps run a migrant housing camp in Cobden. Murillo does not speak 
English. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI says hundreds of sightings have been reported to  
authorities from Wyoming to Ohio, but none have been substantiated 
so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Bartolo said things haven't changed that much since  
Resendez-Ramirez burst into the news. But some migrants are finding 
it tough to get to southern Illinois. Many hitchhike, Bartolo said, 
and motorists aren't eager to pick up Hispanics these days. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a little harder to get a ride,'' he said.

</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- West European foreign and defense  
ministers got a look today at the realities of postwar Kosovo, 
including the site of one of the worst alleged atrocities. 
According to locals, several dozen ethnic Albanian men were herded 
into farm buildings near Velika Krusa in southwestern Kosovo and 
shot, then the buildings were set ablaze. Forensic experts are 
examining remains of the farm for what are believed to be massacre 
victims. Velika Krusa was one of several sites mentioned in the

	Lawsuits Against States Are Limited

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- State governments cannot be sued against their

right, the Supreme Court said today in a major decision on states' 
rights. The justices killed a state court lawsuit by dozens of 
state probation officers seeking to enforce a federal labor law and 
collect overtime pay from Maine. The decision leaves Maine's 
probation officers with a federally protected right to be paid for 
overtime work but with no way to enforce that right besides trying

	Hack Wilson Gets Another RBI

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Chicago Cubs player Hack Wilson died 51 years

when baseball officials added one run batted in to his mark of 190. 
Former baseball writer and now historian Jerome Holtzman examined 
box scores and play-by-play accounts of each game of Wilson's 
record-setting season in 1930. He said the missing RBI came from 
the second game of a doubleheader between the Cubs and Cincinnati 
Reds on July 28, 1930. The Elias Sports Bureau, baseball's official 
statisticians, also reviewed Wilson's totals and agreed with 
Holtzman's assessment.

<HEADLINE> Auto Network To Expand on Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- AutoNation Inc. is challenging the  
growing array of online car-buying services with a new Web site 
that it hopes will help expand its sales nationwide, even in cities 
where there is no AutoNation dealer. 
</P>
<P>
	Publicly traded AutoNation is the nation's largest owner of car  
dealerships and already sells more than 5 percent of its vehicles 
online through its individual dealer Web sites. Executives expect 
its new ``virtual dealership'' will generate one-quarter of its 
sales within five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``So far this year, we've sold more than 15,000 vehicles through  
our more than 270 Web sites; that's $350 million of revenue,'' said 
Steven R. Berrard, co-chief executive. ``By the end of this year, 
we'll sell more than $750 million of automobiles online.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AutoNation predicts business will double to $1.5 billion next  
year and to $3 billion in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based company will link its individual  
dealership sites through a new nationwide site at 
www.AutoNationDirect.com 
</P>
<P>
	The site will feature what AutoNation says is the nation's  
largest inventory of new and used cars, with no-haggle prices and 
``sales guides'' who will be online seven days a week in a live 
chat room. 
</P>
<P>
	The new site, introduced Tuesday, initially will operate only  
for AutoNation's 17 dealerships in the Tampa, Fla., area. The 
company plans to expand it to its other markets by fall and to sign 
up independent dealers in markets where there is no AutoNation 
store. 
</P>
<P>
	AutoNation may become a minority partner in some independent  
dealerships, especially in smaller markets where it does not plan 
to expand on its own soon, Berrard told a news conference in the 
Detroit suburb of Dearborn. 
</P>
<P>
	The competition among car buying services, dealer networks,  
independent dealers and automakers for Internet consumers has 
become intense in recent years. Few in the industry dispute that 
the Internet is a significant sales tool, but much disagreement 
remains over how online car buying will evolve. 
</P>
<P>
	When AutoNation was started three years ago by entrepreneur H.  
Wayne Huizenga, the idea was to bring the superstore retailing 
concept to the used car market. But the AutoNation USA stores had 
mixed success. 
</P>
<P>
	AutoNation then went into the new car business, buying up dozens  
of franchises and quickly becoming the industry's No. 1 retailer. 
Earlier this year, AutoNation began combining its AutoNation USA 
used car stores with new car franchises. It also started to rebadge 
its other dealerships under the AutoNation name. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's big online advantages are its large inventory and  
the fact that it's a franchised dealer selling directly, which 
executives say allows it to respond more quickly to the customer 
than most car buying services. 
</P>
<P>
	Those services, such as Microsoft Corp.'s CarPoint and  
Autobytel.com Inc., act as intermediaries: They sign up dealers, to 
whom they refer potential customers for a fee. The process 
sometimes is not as fast as the services promise. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeremy Anwyl, an analyst with Marketec Systems Inc., said a more  
serious, long-term challenge to AutoNation and other dealers is the 
kind of virtual dealership represented by CarsDirect.com Inc. 
That's the new venture backed by computer executive Michael Dell 
that bypasses the showroom altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	CarsDirect essentially acts as a kind of broker, obtaining cars  
from its dealer partners at wholesale prices and selling them to 
consumers. Unlike most brokers, CarsDirect handles the entire 
transaction online rather than simply matching the buyer and dealer 
for a fee. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the big overhead that AutoNation and traditional  
dealerships have, CarsDirect should be able to undersell the 
competition, Anwyl said, just as Amazon.com has been able to 
undercut traditional bookstores.

<HEADLINE> Quayle Boosts Staff in Iowa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Former Vice President Dan Quayle is  
``ramping up'' his Iowa field organization, doubling the number of 
staffers and boosting the campaign time Quayle will devote to the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	In a memo to ``interested parties'' to be distributed Thursday,  
campaign chairman Kyle McSlarrow described ``major expansions in 
our operation in Iowa.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle is the second GOP candidate to concentrate precious  
campaign cash in Iowa as a response to front-runner George W. 
Bush's fund-raising blitzkrieg. Lamar Alexander recently cut back 
his national staff and travel budgets to save money for the initial 
caucus state. Like Alexander, Quayle has had trouble raising money 
in a field dominated by Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	David Hudson, a top aide to former Gov. Terry Branstad, will  
become the new head of Quayle's Iowa operation, replacing Keith 
Fortmann, who takes over Midwest fund-raising chores. 
</P>
<P>
	Veteran activist Craig Whitney, who has been working from  
Quayle's national campaign office, will become political director 
for Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, three states which hold 
crucial early tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Guy Rodgers, a former national field director for the Christian  
Coalition, has signed on as a consultant, said the memo, obtained 
by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, McSlarrow said the campaign plans to double its  
seven-member field staff by the end of the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Stepping up the intensity further, Quayle has five campaign  
swings planned through the state by mid-August. Some of those will 
be tied to the publication of Quayle's new book ``Worth Fighting 
For.''

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A third party is not the charm for Pat  
Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
	So says his sister and political confidant, Bay Buchanan,  
responding to reports that Buchanan is considering switching 
allegiances from the GOP to the Reform Party of Ross Perot and 
Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pat is a Republican and I don't see him doing anything else,''  
she said in a telephone interview Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	His sister confirmed that Buchanan met recently with consultant  
Roger Stone, who made the case for the former White House 
speechwriter to bolt from the Republican Party. But she said that 
doesn't mean her brother is preparing to take Stone's advice. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been many people over the years asking Pat to go a  
third party,'' Bay Buchanan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan is making his third presidential race.  
</P>

</P>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush will take his  
fledgling presidential campaign to Florida this week, seeking votes 
and money in a state where his kid brother is also governor and one 
of the GOP's best fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush arrives in southwest Florida late Thursday and will spend  
Friday with his brother, Gov. Jeb Bush, meeting with supporters in 
Fort Myers, Tampa, Fort Lauderdale and Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can help him by encouraging all my supporters and friends to  
support his campaign,'' Jeb Bush said. ``It didn't take much 
cajoling because people are very excited about his campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	George W. Bush is riding nearly an unprecedented wave of public  
popularity as he seeks the Republican nomination. One longtime 
Republican contributor, who asked not to be identified, said the 
GOP hopes to raise $2 million during Bush's one-day swing. 
</P>
<P>
	State GOP chairman Al Cardenas said the original goal was  
raising $500,000 to $700,000. ``My understanding is he'll do 
significantly better than that,'' Cardenas said. ``It's going to be 
quite a bit, that's for sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the general election still more than 16 months away, George  
W. Bush has become the favorite for claiming his party's 
nomination, largely because of his ability to raise money. 
</P>
<P>
	That's especially true in Florida, where Republicans control  
both chambers of the state legislature in addition to Bush having a 
sibling as governor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's almost like having the keys to the bank,'' lamented state  
Democratic Party chairman Charles Whitehead.

	Five Atoms May Be Small-Chip Limit  
</P>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Bell Labs scientists say they have found what  
they believe is the limit for making smaller chips using current 
materials -- five atoms. That's the minimum thickness needed for the 
silicon dioxide film at the heart of computers to work. And that's 
assuming the film can be made perfectly smooth. For practical 
purposes, the layer would probably have to be about twice that 
thickness to achieve the required smoothness, the scientists report 
in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature. Currently, the so-called 
gate oxide films used are about 25 atoms thick, said Greg Timp, one 
of the study's authors.

	Chevron To Cut 2,500 Jobs

<P>
	RICHMOND, Calif. (AP) -- Chevron Corp. will cut 2,500 jobs --  
about 1,500 more than it said last year -- as it struggles to combat 
falling oil prices and compete with merging rivals. In December, 
the oil giant said it would lay off about 1,000 people in an 
attempt to reduce its annual expenses by $500 million. The latest 
push to slash costs through mergers and other measures reflects the 
industry's belief that oil prices will remain relatively low for 
several years.

	Europe Told To Coordinate Flights  
</P>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Air traffic delays in Europe have reached crisis  
levels requiring that governments get together to create a 
borderless European sky, the world body for air carriers said 
today. ``European states run their fragmented air traffic control 
services as if they were part of some tiny medieval fiefdom,'' said 
Pierre Jeanniot, director-general of the International Air Traffic 
Association. IATA said Europe faces a severe lack of air-traffic 
control capacity. The situation is especially bad in Switzerland 
and parts of France and Italy.

</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- At the Chicago Board of Trade this week, the hot  
topic isn't grain and soybeans but its own future. The exchange's 
chairman has endorsed an alliance with rival Eurex, an 
all-electronic exchange based in Frankfurt, as the best way to 
ensure survival. Some 2,100 members will hold a pivotal vote 
tomorrow that could decide the exchange's course and determine the 
fate of 150,000 industry-related jobs in the Chicago area. At the 
Board of Trade, business has been conducted for 151 years by 
yelling and gesturing to set forward prices for everything from 
corn and wheat to U.S. Treasury bonds. But as the Internet and 
computer-based technology revolutionize industry, investors are 
finding it easier and cheaper to trade futures and options without 
ever stepping foot in an exchange.

	Doctors' Group Votes for Union  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The nation's largest doctors' group voted today  
to help form a national union to help physicians negotiate with 
managed-care companies. The labor organization would support the 
formation of local bargaining units as an option for the minority 
of physicians who are employees of managed-care or other companies. 
Self-employed doctors would not be involved unless Congress passes 
a measure pending in the House Judiciary Committee to give such 
doctors collective-bargaining rights. The vote by the American 
Medical Association's 494-member House of Delegates overrode 
objections from some doctors who said they want to wait for passage 
of the federal measure.

	Coke Production To Resume in Belgium

<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Coca-Cola Co. prepared today to resume  
production in Belgium after the government agreed to let two 
factories re-open under strict conditions, two weeks after the 
first reports of illnesses from children who drank the company's 
soft drinks. ``Our products are completely safe, both in Belgium 
and worldwide,'' M. Douglas Ivester, Coca-Cola's chairman, said 
today. But a Coca-Cola plant in nearby northern France remained 
closed as judicial officials opened an investigation to determine 
why hundreds of people who drank from cans produced there fell ill. 
Rat poison was detected on the outside of one soft-drink can, but 
no cause of the illnesses has been detected, said Francois Muguet, 
a state prosecutor.

	MOSCOW (AP) -- Natalya Gracheva is giving McDonald's heartburn. A  
security guard at the company's ``McComplex'' factory outside 
Moscow, Gracheva wants to form a trade union. The company has 
blocked her efforts. The struggle is tarnishing the once-golden 
reputation of a pioneer among foreign companies in Russia, and 
observers warn its fallout could spread to other companies. Today, 
a Moscow court opened hearings for a former McDonald's worker who 
says he was fired because of his union activity. The company says 
he was drunk on the job.

<HEADLINE> Politics Takes Over HMO Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The talk is about doctors and patients and the  
cost of health care as the Senate grinds to a halt over the 
patients' bill of rights. Behind the scenes, it's a classic 
political battle. 
</P>
<P>
	Seizing what they think is a winning political issue, Democrats  
are pushing the GOP majority to accept a series of provisions 
regulating HMOs or to vote against them, one by one. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously we'll try to blame them if it doesn't go,'' Rep.  
Pete Stark, D-Calif., said Wednesday. He and other Democrats are 
collecting signatures on a petition that would force the issue, now 
stalled in committee, to the House floor. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, work has come to a standstill as Democrats refuse  
to allow an agriculture spending bill -- or anything else -- to move 
ahead until the two parties reach an agreement on patients' rights. 
</P>
<P>
	That forced the Republican leaders to spend Wednesday in  
``morning business,'' meaning senators take turns giving speeches 
on the floor and there is no activity on legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	While they agitate for votes on managed care, Democrats frame  
the debate in the most personal and sympathetic of terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every child with cancer deserves access to a pediatric  
oncologist,'' said Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Barbara Milkulski, D-Md., described her gall bladder  
surgery, lamenting that while she could stay in the hospital 
overnight, some women who have mastectomies cannot. 
</P>
<P>
	It is not easy to argue against these stories, GOP leaders  
acknowledge. 
</P>
<P>
	So Republicans are trying to avoid taking votes ``that can be  
misconstrued for political purposes,'' said Sen. Don Nickles, 
R-Okla., the No. 2 Republican in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Nickles repeatedly cites a Congressional Budget Office estimate  
that the Democratic bill would increase the cost of health 
insurance by 4.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls show overwhelming majorities want new laws, but support  
drops when people are told it will cost money and force employers 
to drop coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican strategy has been to offer modest legislation to  
address consumer fears that health maintenance organizations and 
other managed care plans skimp on care to save money. Their 
proposals do not allow new lawsuits, for instance, and they let 
insurance companies keep ultimate authority to decide what care is 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither side seems interested in finding common ground, said  
Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, an 
independent health research group that has done extensive polling 
on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question they could reach a compromise here on a  
package of things that would ... greatly satisfy the American 
people,'' Altman said. ``There's every prospect Congress will blow 
the opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That is because both parties have political motivations to hold  
out, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Republicans oppose more federal regulation and would prefer  
to do nothing at all. But there are political considerations: Is it 
better to reach a compromise with Democrats to avoid being accused 
of doing nothing, or to hold out against change since Democrats are 
likely to get the credit for any new rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Democrats say they want legislation, but if Congress  
fails to act, they can use that against Republicans in the 2000 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Nickles said he is not just worried about the politics of voting  
against these stronger provisions. He also is worried that enough 
of his GOP colleagues will vote yes, attaching new rights that 
could drive up the cost of health care. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic bill would increase the cost of an individual  
plan by about $9 per month and a family plan by about $22 per 
month, according the budget office. Much of this is usually paid by 
employers. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides blame the other for failing to act.  
</P>
<P>
	``The insurance companies do not want legislation to pass and  
the Republican leaders do not want to let it pass,'' Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the Democrats are interested in making a law  
here,'' said John Czwartacki, spokesman for Majority Leader Trent 
Lott. ``They're interested in making a political point.''

<HEADLINE> Doctors' Group Votes To Form Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The nation's largest doctors' group voted today  
to help form a national union to help physicians negotiate with 
managed-care companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The labor organization would support the formation of local  
bargaining units as an option for the minority of physicians who 
are employees of managed-care or other companies. Self-employed 
doctors would not be involved unless Congress passes a measure 
pending in the House Judiciary Committee to give such doctors 
collective-bargaining rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote by the American Medical Association's 494-member House  
of Delegates overrode objections from some doctors who said they 
want to wait for passage of the federal measure. 
</P>
<P>
	``My profession is being crushed under the rocks of rules and  
regulations, government interference, HMOs, PPOs and contracts. I 
need help to fight back,'' Dr. Jack Summers of Akron, Ohio, said at 
the AMA's annual policy-making meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law forbids doctors who are not employees from forming  
labor unions in the traditional sense. But the AMA committee that 
recommended the resolution passed today said a legal review found 
the measure to be sound. 
</P>
<P>
	Changing the law is opposed by the head of the Federal Trade  
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Shielding health care professionals from antitrust laws so they  
can collectively bargain with health plans would be ``bad medicine 
for consumers'' and could lead to price-fixing, FTC chairman Robert 
Pitofsky testified Tuesday before the House Judiciary Committee in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the chairman said, a group of physicians in a  
particular medical specialty could join together and demand a 20 
percent increase in their fees and refuse to contract with insurers 
who won't pay those rates. Pharmacists could insist on higher 
payments for filling prescriptions, Pitofsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitofsky said the position of the commission -- which shares  
responsibility for regulation of antitrust matters with the Justice 
Department-- is based on its experience investigating collective 
bargaining by health care professionals and its impact on 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The commission continues to believe that such an exemption  
would be bad medicine for consumers,'' Pitofsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	Without antitrust enforcement measures, Pitofsky predicted,  
health care costs would rise dramatically. Consumers would face 
higher prices for insurance and co-payments, and might face a 
reduction in benefits, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The commission continues to believe that competition among  
health care providers and among health plans is an important tool 
for controlling costs, providing consumer choice and promoting 
innovation and high quality,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that current antitrust laws do not prohibit physicians  
from lobbying or discussing issues with health plans.

<HEADLINE>  Jury Deadlocked in R. Lewis Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The jury in the Reggie Lewis malpractice case told  
a judge Wednesday they had reached verdicts on two consultants in 
the case, but were deadlocked concerning the culpability of the 
lead physician. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury told Suffolk County Judge Thayer Fremont-Smith they  
could not decide whether Dr. Gilbert Mudge's negligence contributed 
to the late Celtics star's death. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury did not disclose its decision regarding the two  
consultants, Drs. Mark Creager and Peter Friedman. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge sent the jurors home for the night and said he would  
re-instruct them Thursday morning. If they continued to be 
deadlocked on Mudge, the judge said, he would hear their decision 
on the consultants. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis' wife had sued Mudge and the consultants, claiming they  
misdiagnosed and mistreated her husband's fatal heart condition. A 
third consultant settled for an undisclosed sum before the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Her attorneys sought $75 million, saying that was the sum Lewis  
would have earned as a professional player. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis collapsed during a playoff game in April 1993 and was  
subsequently diagnosed with a life-threatening, potentially 
career-ending cardiac arrhythmia by a ``Dream Team'' of top doctors 
from New England Baptist Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lewises then turned to Mudge, of Brigham and Women's  
Hospital, who examined Lewis and announced at a news conference the 
player instead had a neurological condition that causes fainting 
spells. Mudge said he probably could return to professional 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	Two months later, on July 27, 1993, Lewis died practicing jump  
shots. He was 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Donna Harris-Lewis had suggested Mudge's judgment  
was clouded by his search for glory as the doctor who proved the 
``Dream Team'' wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	As testimony turned to alleged drug use by the popular athlete,  
Harris-Lewis' attorneys also suggested that Mudge, desperate to 
cover up his mistakes, was ``searching the gutters'' for 
alternative explanations for the death of his most famous patient. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge maintained that Lewis admitted to cocaine use two weeks  
before he died. He said the belated confession made an accurate 
diagnosis impossible and called several convicted felons to testify 
to alleged cocaine and marijuana use by Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge said Lewis also ignored orders not to exercise.  
</P>
<P>
	A third piece of Mudge's defense was that, despite the news  
conference in which he declared Lewis' heart healthy, he privately 
suspected the player might have a serious heart condition -- and was 
treating him with beta blockers that addressed both the fainting 
condition and the possible cardiac problem. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he told the family and the Celtics of his concerns, but  
both groups disputed that claim.

<HEADLINE> Conservatives Seek FAA Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In what conservatives hope will give them  
budget-cutting leverage, the House has decided to eliminate the 
salaries of the nation's air traffic controllers and air safety 
inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone acknowledges that will never become reality. But  
conservatives think the action will help them win reductions in the 
Federal Aviation Administration budget when House-Senate 
negotiators write a compromise bill later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The House approved a $44.5 billion transportation bill for  
fiscal 2000 on Wednesday by an overwhelming 429-3. That vote 
occurred after a $5.9 billion section paying the salaries of FAA 
employees, including air traffic controllers and air safety 
inspectors, was deleted on procedural grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to eliminate air traffic controllers,'' said Rep.  
Tom Coburn, R-Okla., who successfully moved to eliminate the 
language. 
</P>
<P>
	He added, ``Our goal is to get spending under control in the  
House, and at the same time to have adequate funds for the FAA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When the process is completed, the FAA, the safety of airways,  
will be in good shape,'' said Rep. Bill Young, R-Fla., chairman of 
the House Appropriations Committee, which produced the original 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the legislation contains increases of hundreds of  
millions of dollars for airports and aviation systems, road 
building and mass transit. The full Senate has yet to consider its 
version of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA provision was eliminated for the technical reason that  
the FAA's legal authority to function has not yet been renewed by 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers often ignore such technicalities, but Coburn used it  
to set the groundwork for possible cuts. He and other conservatives 
have been forcing reductions in the first few spending bills the 
House has produced, arguing that Republicans have pledged to 
control spending and not use Social Security surpluses to beef up 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	By voice vote, the House also agreed to cut $300 million from  
the bill in excess airport improvement funds. Young said most of 
the money wouldn't have been spent anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservatives won one definite reduction: a symbolic $1 million  
cut from the $158 million proposed for Transportation Department 
administrative functions. 
</P>
<P>
	By 241-190, the House also approved an amendment by Rep. James  
Rogan, R-Calif., that would block federal funds for a long-proposed 
extension of the 710 freeway through Pasadena and South Pasadena, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogan hopes his language will kill the planned 4 1/2-mile project.  
Supporters of the road say it would speed traffic in the area, but 
opponents say it would divide neighborhoods and cause the 
destruction of scores of historic homes and trees.

<HEADLINE> Workers Vote in Favor of the Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANNAPOLIS, N.C. (AP) -- After failing four times, textile  
workers at six Fieldcrest Cannon plants in the state voted in favor 
of union representation on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Of about 5,100 workers, 2,270 voted for joining the Union of  
Needletrades Industrial and Textile Employees, or UNITE, and 2,102 
voted against. Both sides challenged about 285 votes, but officials 
said the vote will stand for now. 
</P>
<P>
	Voting began Tuesday and ended Wednesday night, when National  
Labor Relations Board agents counted the ballots. 
</P>
<P>
	When the vote total was announced the union side erupted with  
cheers and about a dozen supporters ran outside the high school 
auditorium here, where everyone had gathered. 
</P>
<P>
	``We worked so hard for this I think we deserved it,'' said  
Tracy Carr, a folder. 
</P>
<P>
	Delores Gambrell, a weaver, said she felt the union would give  
workers job protection in the face of plant modernizations. 
Gambrell has worked at the plant for 28 years with her husband, 
Robert. 
</P>
<P>
	Another longtime employee, Susie Lyerly, a clerk, said she voted  
against union representation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel we need someone to speak for us. I've been with  
this company for 30 years and I've fought this union for the last 
25 years,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fieldcrest Cannon workers rejected organizing efforts four times  
beginning in 1974. A court ordered an election in 1997 after the 
union claimed it lost a close 1991 vote because Fieldcrest 
intimidated and fired workers. The union lost the 1997 election, 
2,563 to 2,194. 
</P>
<P>
	This election took place under a different corporate presence.  
Fieldcrest Cannon was bought by Dallas-based Pillowtex shortly 
after the 1997 election, creating one of the world's largest 
manufacturers of bed and bath linen. 
</P>
<P>
	Fieldcrest Cannon makes towels, sheets, comforters, dust ruffles  
and rugs, under the names Royal Velvet, Cannon, Touch of Class and 
Charisma. 
</P>
<P>
	Pillowtex makes bed pillows, mattress pads, blankets, throws and  
down comforters under the Ralph Lauren, Disney and Martha Stewart 
names.

<HEADLINE> Gehry Eyes Colorful Corcoran Design </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON -- Architect Frank O. Gehry, recently chosen to design  
a new wing of the Corcoran Gallery of Art near the White House, 
said Wednesday his plan ``looks like a bunch of colored pieces of 
paper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gehry's radical design of the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao,  
Spain, has roused criticism for its big plunging, curved forms. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Atherton, secretary of the capital's Fine Arts  
Commission, predicted the adventurous design for the Corcoran, 
contrasting with the austere white columns of many Washington 
buildings, also will invite much debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to describe the look of his model, Gehry said at a news  
conference: 
</P>
<P>
	``To me it looks like a bunch of colored pieces of paper. At  
this point, you know, there's no substance to it, except it's a 
sketch. So you just look at it. You just blink and get a sense. I'm 
trying to achieve a certain energy. I'm trying to be a good 
neighbor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Corcoran building would not look like the Bilbao  
Museum.

<HEADLINE> Salinger Sympathizer Buys Letters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- J.D. Salinger and Joyce Maynard both got what  
they wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	The 14 letters Salinger sent his teen-aged girlfriend in the  
early 1970s sold for $156,500 Tuesday to a retired California 
software millionaire who promised to return them to the reclusive 
author. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Maynard, who said she wanted to use the proceeds from the  
Sotheby's auction to send her children to college, will profit 
handsomely from the sale of the letters, which fetched twice their 
estimate of $60,000 to $80,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Salinger won't have to suffer further affronts to his cherished  
privacy, promised buyer Peter Norton, a Santa Monica, Calif., 
philanthropist whose company, Peter Norton Computing Inc., created 
the popular Norton Utilities programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I share the widely expressed opinion that the work should be  
bought by someone sympathetic to Mr. Salinger's desire for 
privacy,'' Norton, 56, said in a statement. ``I plan to return the 
letters to Mr. Salinger or do whatever else Mr. Salinger lets me 
know he wants done with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norton placed his bid in advance and was not at Sotheby's  
auction house Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Maynard, a writer, was heavily criticized for deciding to  
sell Salinger's letters. 
</P>
<P>
	New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd labeled her a ``leech,''  
the National Review magazine called her an ``opportunistic onetime 
nymphet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salinger was, of course, silent. Now age 80, he lives in  
Cornish, N.H., and still shuns publicity. He has not published in 
34 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Maynard, a divorced mother of three, had said supporting her  
children is more important to her than protecting Salinger's 
privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``My decision to sell these letters is not some kind of act of  
retribution against Salinger,'' Ms. Maynard, now 45, had said 
before Tuesday's auction. ``It's a financial decision. I'd rather 
put my efforts to supporting my three children than to have a box 
of Salinger letters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Maynard did not attend the auction and was not available to  
comment Tuesday, Sotheby's said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Maynard partially excerpted the letters in her 1998 book,  
``At Home in the World,'' which also detailed her romance with 
Salinger, which took place when he was 53 and she was 18. 
</P>
<P>
	The two began corresponding in 1972, when he wrote her to praise  
a story she wrote for The New York Times Magazine, called ``An 
18-Year-Old Looks Back on Life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That letter was signed, ``Sincerely, J.D. Salinger.'' Later, he  
grew less formal, ending with ``Love, Jerry,'' offering his phone 
number and arranging a meeting. The letters stopped after Ms. 
Maynard dropped out of Yale University to move in with him. 
</P>
<P>
	The topics range from movies and TV -- he liked Hitchcock and ``I  
Love Lucy'' -- to his writing routines and taking his children to 
local sporting events. At one point, he wrote of feeling 
``depressed'' and ``drained'' after socializing. 
</P>
<P>
	The letters also illuminate Salinger's obsession.  
</P>
<P>
	``He warns her of the impending fame, to be careful of what  
happens when you go in front of the public eye,'' said Marsha 
Malinowski, Sotheby's manuscript expert. ``He's talking about 
privacy, that she needs to keep her life private.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malinowski declined to say whether Salinger or anyone acting on  
his behalf bid on the letters.

<HEADLINE> Photographer Sues Pirates Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Joel Zwink, a contract photographer for the  
San Diego Padres, is suing Pittsburgh players Jason Schmidt and 
Turner Ward for allegedly injuring his eye by shining a laser 
pointer at him during an April 20 game against the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	Zwink filed the complaint June 7 in Superior Court in San Diego  
County. His complaint alleges negligence, battery, assault and 
conspiracy on the part of the players. 
</P>
<P>
	Zwink wants unspecified damages for medical and related  
expenses, lost earnings and the cost of the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The team declined comment Wednesday pending review of the case  
by legal counsel, said Jim Trdinich, director of media relations 
for the Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit alleges Schmidt and Ward were warned to stop using  
the laser pointer but aimed it at Zwink's eyes while he looked 
through his camera lens. He was taking pictures near the Padres 
dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	Zwink said he suffered blurry vision the next day and required  
medical care. He also said he suffered such serious injuries that 
his ``earning capacity has been impaired.''

<HEADLINE> Norway Steamrolls Canada 7-1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANDOVER, Md. (AP) -- Defending champion Norway, controlling the  
game with a precision attack against an inferior opponent, became 
the first team to qualify for the quarterfinals of the Women's 
World Cup with a 7-1 rout of Canada on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ann Kristin Aarones had two goals and an assist, Unni Lehn  
scored on an elegant give-and-go, Hege Riise nailed a 19-yard free 
kick, Linda Medalen and Marianne Pettersen scored off corner kicks, 
and Solveig Gulbrandsen netted on a fast break. 
</P>
<P>
	The result matched Brazil's 7-1 victory over Mexico on Saturday  
as the most lopsided of the tournament to date. 
</P>
<P>
	Norway, runner-up to the United States in 1991 and winner of the  
1995 tournament, beat Russia 2-1 in its Group C opener. It finishes 
group play Saturday against Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada tied Japan 1-1 in its first game, and the Canadians'  
hopes for advancing rest on Saturday's game against Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Norwegians beat Canada 7-0 in the 1995 World Cup, and again  
dominated this one from the opening kickoff, easily controlling the 
midfield with an elegant passing attack and taking advantage of 
wide-open spaces on the wings left by the bunched-up Canadian 
defense. Lehn forced a kick save from goalkeeper Nicci Wright and 
Aarones put a shot off the left post in the first seven minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	One minute later, Aarones got her first goal, a right-footed  
volley from eight yards off a chip-shot pass from Monica Knudsen. 
</P>
<P>
	Norway eased off the attack, and Canada took advantage in the  
31st minute by scoring on its first shot on goal. Substitute Andrea 
Neil headed a cross to Charmaine Hooper in the crowded penalty box, 
and Hooper slid home the shot from 10 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the game, however, the Canadians had trouble putting  
three passes together as they tried to mount an attack without 
leading scorer Silvana Burtini, out with a hamstring injury. Norway 
had no such trouble, with Aarones heading Riise's cross in the 36th 
minute, and Pettersen, Aarones and Lehn combining for four quick 
passes after a throw-in on the right wing to set up Lehn's goal in 
the 49th. 
</P>
<P>
	Riise made it 4-1 with a curling free kick around the wall in  
the 54th, and Medalen and Pettersen converted corner kicks in the 
62nd and 76th. 
</P>
<P>
	Medalen's goal was her ninth in three World Cups. She also has  
three assists, giving her 21 points to tie her atop the World Cup 
career list with Michelle Akers of the United States and Heidi Mohr 
of Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Substitute Gulbrandsen finished the scoring with a fast-break  
goal in the 87th minute.

<HEADLINE> Japan May Shut Down Credit Suisse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's Financial Supervisory Agency will likely  
order Credit Suisse Group to close its Japanese operations as early 
as next month for obstructing a probe into whether it helped 
Japanese companies hide losses, a newspaper said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency, which oversees Japan's financial industry, may also  
revoke the operating licenses of some member companies of the Swiss 
financial group, the Nihon Keizai newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	An official at the agency could not be reached for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Credit Suisse has been under investigation since January on  
suspicion it helped Japanese companies disguise losses by using 
complicated financial derivatives. The agency will officially 
announce the results of the probe in July, when the punishments 
will also be decided, the Nihon Keizai said. 
</P>
<P>
	The group said last month it has suspended some employees and  
cut the salaries of others after an internal probe also concluded 
they may have hindered the Financial Supervisory Agency's 
inspection. 
</P>
<P>
	Employees at Credit Suisse's Tokyo offices allegedly stayed up  
late at night destroying records and secretly mailed some 40 boxes 
of sensitive documents to the group's London office in an attempt 
to keep them from falling into the hands of Japanese investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	Newspaper reports have alleged that Credit Suisse's investment  
bank, Credit Suisse First Boston Corp., marketed several plans to 
help Japanese companies hide losses from their balance sheets. 
</P>
<P>
	After years of winking at the practice by the country's ailing  
banks and other firms, Japanese regulators may finally be cracking 
down. 
</P>
<P>
	This follows public uproar over the discovery of tens of  
billions of dollars in hidden losses at two banks nationalized by 
the agency late last year.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon: Russians Fought for Serbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon says Russian mercenaries fought  
in Kosovo alongside Serb forces, and their role is likely to be 
examined as part of an international investigation of war crimes 
against ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly know that Russians participated. Russian  
volunteers, mercenaries, we believe, did participate with 
paramilitary and other Serb forces,'' Pentagon spokesman Kenneth 
Bacon said Tuesday. He had been asked to comment on a report in 
Newsday that dozens of Russian volunteers had participated in the 
killing of hundreds of ethnic Albanians and the destruction of 
towns and villages around Prizren in southern Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not have verification that there were units or groups of  
the size that Newsday reports,'' Bacon said. ``But we do believe 
that there was some Russian participation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon also announced that 12 Air Force B-52 bombers are  
expected to begin returning to their U.S. bases today from England, 
where they flew strike missions against Yugoslavia throughout 
NATO's bombing campaign. In all, nearly 400 U.S. planes will return 
to normal duty in coming weeks, Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	The aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt, whose F/A-18 and  
F-14 warplanes participated in the NATO air campaign, will leave 
the Mediterranean and take up station in the Persian Gulf in July, 
Navy officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The USS 
Kitty Hawk and its battle group, now in the Gulf, will then leave 
and return to its home station in Yokosuka, Japan, in early 
September -- filling a carrier gap in the western Pacific that has 
existed since early April. In the meantime, the USS Constellation 
has left the West Coast and will eventually replace the Roosevelt 
in the Gulf in September. 
</P>
<P>
	The matter of Russia's role in Kosovo is sensitive. NATO has  
arranged for 3,600 Russian troops to join KFOR, the Kosovo Force of 
peacekeepers, including in the southern sector commanded by German 
forces. Russians have cultural ties to the Serbs, and Moscow 
strongly opposed NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the Russian forces arrive as part of KFOR, we expect them  
to be totally fair and professional in their dealings with both 
Serbs and Kosovar Albanians, as they have been in Bosnia and where 
they have been very stalwart and successful members of the 
peacekeeping force,'' Bacon said. ``I anticipate that the Russian 
troops coming to Kosovo will be exactly the same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon said the Kosovo Liberation Army, the guerrilla band that  
fought against the Serb forces in pursuit of independence for the 
Serb province, had told NATO authorities during the 78 days of NATO 
bombing that Russians were involved and that a number of Russians 
had been killed. He said it was unclear whether the deaths were 
caused by NATO bombing or combat with the KLA rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	The Newsday report, citing ethnic Albanian and Serb security  
sources, mentioned several examples of Russian involvement in 
atrocities against ethnic Albanians. It said a group of about 60 
Russians was ordered out of Kosovo just last week by German 
soldiers. The Russian volunteers were military men either retired 
or not in active service, the newspaper reported, and their 
commander was an army colonel. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsday reported that the Russians were organized as a single  
unit and operated under the aegis of the Special Purpose Police of 
the Federal Ministry of the Interior in Belgrade. Bacon said the 
Pentagon had no independent confirmation of this or other details 
of the Russian involvement in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our impression is that they were mercenaries, but this is  
something that I'm sure will be looked into by war crimes 
investigators, who are now going into Kosovo in considerable 
numbers to try to figure out what happened and who was responsible 
for it,'' Bacon said.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A new partnership between America Online Inc.  
and 3Com Corp. will allow AOL's more than 17 million subscribers to 
receive, read and send e-mail using Palm electronic organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the first time AOL members will have access to their  
e-mail accounts via a handheld computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Palm organizers will come bundled with the AOL software, and AOL  
will offer a package that includes a Palm organizer, e-mail 
software and, if necessary, a modem to its members, the companies 
announced in a statement Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Decision Due on Lamb Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The administration, expected soon to decide  
whether to impose stiff tariffs on lamb imported from Australia and 
New Zealand, is considering ``a wide range of proposals,'' U.S. 
Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are weighing what is the most appropriate and least trade  
restrictive policy,'' Barshefsky said at a House Agriculture 
Committee hearing on the upcoming World Trade Organization 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, the U.S. International Trade Commission, an  
independent trade regulator, ruled in favor of U.S. sheep farmers 
that low-priced lamb products from abroad had hurt their industry. 
</P>
<P>
	All six commissioners have recommended at least some level of  
protection, ranging from quotas to tariffs, for the four-year 
period sought by the U.S. industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton should decide on a final remedy in about two weeks,  
Barshefsky said. A decision had been due June 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheep producers have said that during the first nine months of  
last year, 76.9 million pounds of imports entered the United States 
-- 19 percent more than the first nine months of 1997. Australia and 
New Zealand supply 95 percent of imported lamb, which now accounts 
for almost one-third of the domestic market. 
</P>
<P>
	Barshefsky suggested the dispute has placed the administration  
in an awkward situation: how best to retaliate against two 
countries long allied in trade with the United States, just months 
before WTO talks in which the administration is certain to push for 
expanded access to foreign markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``This delay is really weakening the confidence in our trade  
laws,'' said Cathy Cummins, spokeswoman for the American Sheep 
Industry Association. ``We feel we played by the rules. ... We 
don't think the U.S. government should sacrifice its domestic sheep 
industry simply to satisfy the requests of another government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just last week, Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer met  
with Barshefsky, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and 
members of Congress during a two-day visit.

<HEADLINE> Deadline Looming on Medical Privacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the deadline for passing medical privacy  
legislation two months away, the Department of Health and Human 
Services is already writing regulations that would take effect if 
Congress fails to act. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're developing the regulations as we speak,'' Chris  
Jennings, President Clinton's top health policy adviser, said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jennings said that the administration still prefers that  
Congress write the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Congress gave itself a three-year deadline to write  
federal privacy protections for medical records. As it stands, 
there is no federal law prohibiting people from passing around 
patient medical records for all sorts of inappropriate purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	If Congress fails to act by August, the Clinton administration  
is required to write regulations on its own. 
</P>
<P>
	But after significant effort and intense lobbying from the  
health industry and privacy advocates, Congress has failed to come 
up with a plan. A Senate committee has canceled four scheduled 
votes because it could not reach a compromise acceptable to most 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., says it's clear that Congress is  
going to miss the deadline. He wrote Clinton this week asking that 
he direct Shalala to move forward. He also urged the president to 
veto any legislation extending the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``Effective privacy protection has been delayed too long  
already, and there is no justification for extending the date to 
the detriment of privacy rights of all Americans,'' wrote Leahy, a 
leading privacy advocate. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennings said the HHS has been working on privacy regulations  
for months, just in case Congress fails to pass a bill, because it 
takes so long to develop them. 
</P>
<P>
	Intense negotiations in the Senate over the legislation have  
taken a back seat to the debate over managed care regulations. The 
approaching deadline -- and Leahy's letter -- should prompt parties 
to work out their differences, said Joe Karpinski, spokesman for 
the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot to be lost by a lot of people by not going with  
legislation,'' he said. Perhaps a threat of administrative rules, 
he said, will help ``people stop just looking at the trees and get 
a chance to look at the forest again.''

<HEADLINE> Soccer Teens Could Win $1 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Two 13-year-olds will get a chance to become instant  
millionaires on Thursday during the United States vs. Nigeria game. 
Crystal Juarez of Chicago and Werner Ramirez of Long Beach, Calif., 
will try to kick a ball through a designated target at halftime of 
the game. If they succeed, they will get $1 million each. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if they miss the target, the 13-year-olds will still take  
home at least $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
	To help the kids shoot Alexi Lasas, two-time member of the  
United States men's World Cup team and a player for the MLS Kansas 
City Wizards, will be their mentor and on-field supporter. 
</P>
<P>
	The promotion is sponsored by Allstate Insurance Company, which  
will match the winnings of Juarez and Ramirez with a donation to 
the National Alliance of Youth Sports. 
</P>
<P>
	The finalists were selected at random from 1,300 entries. Kids  
between 10 and 14 could enter the contest at local soccer 
tournaments and professional soccer games in World Cup cities or 
via mail-in registration. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

<P>
	 *BROKEN NOSE:* Denmark forward Karina Christensen is exiting the  
World Cup with a severely broken nose. 
</P>
<P>
	During a training session Wednesday, Christensen was  
accidentally hit in the face by defender Ulla Knudsen's elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	The team's physician, Mogens Kreutzfeldt, ordered X-rays taken  
of Christensen's nose and then told her to go home. She is to 
return to Denmark within the next five days. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, coach Joergen Hvidmose said Christensen's  
departure was ``a great loss for the team,'' and she had been 
``among Denmark's top players in the last three matches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite the accident, I remain optimistic regarding Denmark's  
chances in the two upcoming games against North Korea and 
Nigeria,'' Hvidmose said. 
</P>
<P>
	Christensen has played 13 games for the Danish team.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *A WOMAN'S GAME:* Even though women's soccer is breaking new  
ground during this year's Women's World Cup, in many participating 
countries playing soccer is not exactly considered ladylike. 
</P>
<P>
	China's star player, Wen Sun, said girls in her country didn't  
really play soccer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The game of soccer is not very popular for women,'' said Wen.  
``The activity for most girls is dancing and playing the piano.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Memunatu Sulemana, the goalkeeper for Ghana's Black Queens, said  
her grandmother had misgivings about the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``My grandmother didn't like me playing (soccer),'' she said.  
``She said that it is a man's game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fortunately for Sulemana, her grandmother has accepted her  
soccer career, but she still worries. 
</P>
<P>
	``She hopes I stay healthy,'' said Sulemana.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *RFK SNUB:* For years, RFK Stadium in Washington was considered  
the unofficial home field of American soccer. When the stadium 
wasn't awarded the championship match of the Women's World Cup, the 
locals felt snubbed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt Washington deserved the final,'' stadium manager Jim  
Dalrymple said. ``To us, it made no sense to take those other 
games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So RFK, a venue for the 1994 men's World Cup and host for  
numerous other international matches, pulled out of the tournament. 
Another Washington-area venue, Jack Kent Cooke Stadium in Landover, 
Md., was awarded three first- and second-round doubleheaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike RFK, Cooke Stadium had never staged a soccer game before  
Wednesday night's first-round doubleheader. Also, RFK's wide field 
and partially enclosed design make it a perfect venue for soccer, 
while Cooke Stadium's surface is just barely wide enough to hold an 
official-sized field. Its plain, open structure with 80,000 seats 
usually requires at least 60,000 people to create any kind of 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	Women's World Cup organizers say they didn't offer the  
championship game to RFK because it isn't big enough to hold the 
record crowds they began projecting following the huge turnouts for 
the medal games of the 1996 Olympics. RFK has about 55,000 seats, 
while the Rose Bowl, host of the July 10 final, holds 86,000. The 
Rose Bowl also was the site of the 1994 World Cup final.

<HEADLINE> Univ. President To Meet Haskins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Minnesota basketball coach Clem Haskins plans  
to meet with the university's president regarding the investigation 
of the basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I want to say is I'm looking forward to telling my  
story,'' Haskins said. ``Beyond that, I have no comment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The school is investigating the program for allegations of  
academic fraud, improper payments, travel irregularities and 
improper relationships with university police. Haskins has said he 
had no knowledge of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	University president Mark Yudof said he would decide Haskins'  
status after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to hear his side of the story,'' Yudof said. ``I want  
to be fair to the man. I have some information from the lawyers who 
are doing our investigation, but not too much. After I meet with 
Haskins, I will try to make a decision on where we go from there. 
This is a very complicated situation, and not easy to solve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president would not say when the meeting would take place.  
</P>
<P>
	Yudof instructed university attorneys almost three weeks ago to  
begin discussions on a buyout of the remaining three years of 
Haskins' contract. No agreement has been reached, largely because 
Haskins has maintained he wants to coach next season. 
</P>
<P>
	There is pressure on Yudof to resolve Haskins' status soon.  
</P>
<P>
	Haskins' contract is structured so that it will cost the school  
about $74,000 more to fire him if he is not terminated by the end 
of the month. 
</P>
<P>
	It also requires the university to pay him a substantial sum  
even if he is fired for just cause. The contract entitles Haskins 
to about $1.3 million plus several hundred thousand dollars in 
benefits if he is terminated without just cause. If he is fired 
with cause, he would receive his one-time deferred compensation of 
$423,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, college coaches can begin in-person evaluation of  
high school players on July 8, and Yudof has expressed concerns 
about Minnesota's ability to recruit players while Haskins' status 
is in limbo.

<HEADLINE> American To Integrate Reno Air </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- American Airlines will fold employees  
and airplanes of Reno Air into its own operations by the end of the 
summer, nearly eight months after the nation's No. 2 carrier bought 
the low-cost airline for $124 million. 
</P>
<P>
	When the integration takes place on Aug. 31, Reno Air employees  
will be wearing American Airlines uniforms, Reno's jet aircraft 
will belong to American's fleet, all of Reno's flights will be 
American flights, and all airport signage will be changed to 
American, according to the company. 
</P>
<P>
	One issue that still won't be settled will be pilot pay.  
</P>
<P>
	American pilots contend that the airline has continued to bypass  
its contract with the Allied Pilots Association by not paying Reno 
Air pilots at the higher American salary rates from the Dec. 23 
purchase date. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're changing uniforms and paint schemes,'' Drew Engelke, a  
pilot with American and union spokesman, said Wednesday. ``The fact 
of the matter is we've believed the Reno pilots have been flying 
all along as American pilots and should have been paid at American 
rates by Dec. 23.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andrea Rader, a spokeswoman for AMR Corp., parent company of  
American, said details involving pilot pay have yet to be settled. 
The company is expected to soon consider when salary rates will 
change for the pilots, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the company is going to continue integration without  
changing pay rates it's adding insult to injury,'' said Engelke. 
</P>
<P>
	The disagreement over pay rates reached a boiling point in  
February when nearly 6,700 flights were canceled and thousands of 
passengers were stranded because disgruntled pilots called in sick 
to work. The work action cost the company millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	The sickout ended after a federal judge held the union and its  
two top officers in contempt and fined them $45 million for 
initially ignoring his order to tell pilots to return to their 
cockpits. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilots union will appeal both the contempt ruling and the  
compensatory damages as soon as the judge formally issues his 
ruling, said Engelke. 
</P>
<P>
	American's acquisition of Reno Air will help it better compete  
in California against United and Southwest airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	When Reno Air's operations are finished being folded into  
American, they will add more than 150 nonstop flights a day to 
American's West Coast route network. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR also has created a frequent flyer program relationship with  
Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the carrier said it is nearing the completion of  
the first phase of a $245 million improvement project for its 
passenger terminal at Los Angeles International Airport.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Plans N.Y. Swing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Prospective Senate candidate Hillary Rodham  
Clinton will begin an extended campaign-like swing across New York 
next month with a visit to the rural home of Sen. Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan, advisers to both said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrat Moynihan's planned retirement next year after 24 years  
in the Senate has set up a possible clash between the first lady 
and Republican New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani for the seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton plans to announce formation of her Senate  
exploratory committee shortly after the July 4th weekend. Kicking 
off her New York foray will be a visit to Moynihan's rural hideaway 
near Oneonta, probably on July 7, said the advisers, who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate comment from Mrs. Clinton or Moynihan.  
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani announced formation of his Senate exploratory committee  
earlier this year. Neither he nor Mrs. Clinton is expected to make 
a formal candidacy announcement before the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	On the GOP side, Rep. Rick Lazio of Long Island said he expects  
to announce his Senate candidacy sometime this summer. Mrs. Clinton 
is expected to be unopposed for the Democratic nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady has already set up a fund-raising team for her  
expected Senate bid, and one adviser said her aides are on the 
verge of leasing campaign office space in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	After her visit with Moynihan, the first lady plans to make a  
series of stops across central and eastern New York, hitting small 
towns and cities alike. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday evening, July 9, Mrs. Clinton will be in Albany for a  
fund-raising reception for Rep. Michael McNulty. Ticket prices will 
range from $50 for the general reception to $500 for those who want 
to attend a private gathering with her and McNulty. 
</P>
<P>
	The next week will see her concentrating on more western areas  
of the state, including a July 16 fund-raiser in Rochester for Rep. 
Louise Slaughter, who says Mrs. Clinton could win the Senate seat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that people are going to say she doesn't live in New  
York, but I wasn't born there either,'' the Kentucky-born 
congresswoman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	While Giuliani and other Republicans have already attacked Mrs.  
Clinton as a ``carpetbagger,'' Slaughter said she didn't think that 
would stick in New York. ``We really are an open state,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in July or in August, Mrs. Clinton plans to visit the  
lower Hudson Valley and Long Island, concentrating on the 
politically crucial suburbs surrounding New York City, and spending 
more time in the city itself.

<HEADLINE> Report: VW Eyes Scania Truck Maker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- The German automaker Volkswagen AG has begun  
exploring the possibility of making a takeover offer for Swedish 
commercial vehicle maker Scania AB, the Financial Times reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said VW's investment banker, Salomon Smith Barney,  
has been discussing a possible acquisition with Scania's major 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Rival Swedish truck maker Volvo AB is also interested, having  
bought almost 22 percent of Scania this year. Scania earlier in the 
year declined a friendly takeover. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for both Volkswagen and Scania declined to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said neither Volkswagen nor Volvo has been able to  
agree on a valuation for Scania, which is considered one of the 
most attractive takeover candidates in the truck industry. 
</P>
<P>
	VW previously has said it's interested in entering the heavy  
truck market but has stressed that it wouldn't do so through a 
costly acquisition.

<HEADLINE> Williamstown: Summer's Hot Theater </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass. (AP) -- Actress Hope Davis lies seductively  
on a shaky, blue-cushioned chaise longue that looks like a 
rummage-sale reject. 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing a red T-shirt, blue jeans, striped socks and,  
incongruously, a sheer veil, she watches Ethan Hawke pace the floor 
in the gymnasium-like basement of St. John's Episcopal Church. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it worked better when I was over there,'' Hawke says  
to director Nicholas Martin, who is encouraging, if noncommittal, 
about the suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin sits on the other side of an elongated card table,  
littered with scraps of paper, scripts, bottled water and empty 
cartons of low-fat yogurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis and Hawke rehearse snippets of what is a sweet-tempered  
seduction scene that culminates with Hawke lifting the veil from 
Davis' wide-eyed face. They do it again. And again. And again. 
Martin smiles and nods. 
</P>
<P>
	Welcome to the glamorous world of theater. The play is ``Camino  
Real,'' a Tennessee Williams dream fantasy that flopped on Broadway 
in 1953 and has rarely been seen since. 
</P>
<P>
	That -- and the fact ``Camino Real'' has a cast of 43 -- hasn't  
deterred the Williamstown Theater Festival from opening its 
mainstage summer season with the play. The production, which also 
stars Blair Brown and Jeffrey Jones, runs June 23-July 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``Camino Real'' is just the beginning. It is one of 10 plays  
being done in the festival's two theaters from June until the end 
of August. This year's adventurous -- and starry -- lineup has 
created a buzz beyond the quiet corner of northwestern 
Massachusetts where the festival is located. In fact, WTF, located 
on the campus of Williams College, is the summer's hottest theater. 
</P>
<P>
	The match that ignited the rush for tickets was Gwyneth Paltrow.  
Long before winning this year's Academy Award for ``Shakespeare in 
Love,'' she was a Williamstown regular, thanks to her mother, 
actress Blythe Danner. Paltrow practically grew up here while her 
mother performed on stage. Paltrow has worked here, too, last 
appearing at the theater in 1995 in ``The Sea Gull.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This summer she is playing Rosalind in Shakespeare's ``As You  
Like It,'' Aug. 4-15. Tickets sold out within a week of the 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides ``Camino Real,'' seats still are available for the other  
main productions -- ``The Taming of the Shrew,'' ``A Raisin in the 
Sun'' and ``The Price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But all tickets for shows in the festival's tiny 99-seat theater  
are gone. They include three world premieres: ``Chaucer in Rome'' 
by John Guare, ``The Waverly Gallery'' by Kenneth Lonergan and 
``Glimmer Brothers'' by Warren Leight, author of ``Side Man,'' the 
1999 Tony winner for best play. 
</P>
<P>
	Paltrow isn't the only big name. In addition to Hawke and Brown,  
Bebe Neuwirth and Roger Rees will battle in ``Shrew.'' And then 
there are appearances by such TV stars as David Schwimmer of 
``Friends,'' Richard Kind of ``Spin City'' and James McDaniel of 
``NYPD Blue. '' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the festival's prime spark is not a well-known actor, but  
rather its lanky, unassuming producer, a man who prefers that title 
to artistic director. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Ritchie was a New York City stage manager, who worked on  
scores of productions, primarily at Broadway's Circle in the 
Square, before coming here as a stage manager. His wife, actress 
Kate Burton, is a Williamstown veteran. They fell in love with the 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't very hard. Williamstown, at the top of the Berkshires  
not far from the Vermont state line, could be Hollywood's idea of 
the perfect New England college town. Green lawns and church 
steeples abound. The theater, located in a graceful red brick 
building fronted by white columns, sits on a tree-lined Main Street 
in the middle of campus. 
</P>
<P>
	``We both made a decision that we would try to make ourselves  
available to come up here every summer,'' says Ritchie, relaxing 
for a moment in the theater's library right off the main lobby. 
``For the work, for the people that were here, and what it meant 
for us as a family -- at the time, we had a young son.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 41-year-old Ritchie was elevated to the top job in 1996. At  
the time, the festival was struggling to regain the glory it 
achieved under founder Nikos Psacharopoulos. 
</P>
<P>
	Until his death in 1989, Nikos -- no one called him  
Psacharopoulos -- was a godlike presence at Williamstown with an 
unerring theatrical sense that brought more than the usual fare to 
his theater. ``We are not summer stock -- we are a festival,'' he 
would say. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a tradition Ritchie upholds, forsaking the easy route of  
presenting last year's Broadway hit or an old, popular musical. 
</P>
<P>
	He modestly deflects much of the talk about success, crediting  
it to luck, the healthy economy and the fact that theater companies 
simply evolve. 
</P>
<P>
	``Theaters go through curves and sometimes they just bubble to  
the top for whatever reason,'' he says. ``In the early 1950s, 
Circle in the Square off-Broadway was the defining theater. Then 
there was Circle Rep in the 1970s, Steppenwolf in Chicago in the 
early 1980s, then Lincoln Center under Gregory Mosher and Bernard 
Gersten in the mid '80s and now Roundabout on Broadway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others are more forthright in their praise of Ritchie's  
contributions to Williamstown. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael is not some monomaniac artistic director who calls  
himself a producer,'' says director Martin, munching french fries 
and sharing sodas with Hawke and Brown at the student union 
cafeteria. ``He is very clear about everybody's roles. He lets the 
artistic people do just that. He wants to produce. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he got this job, he called everyone he knew -- which is an  
extensive bunch of people -- and said, `I have this theater here. Do 
you have any ideas?' and he acted on them,'' says Martin, who has 
directed such off-Broadway hits as ``Full Gallop'' and ``Betty's 
Summer Vacation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``People who read `Camino Real' think it is very strange,'' says  
Hawke, who plays the pivotal Everyman role, Kilroy, in the 
production. ``People who've seen it say, `It is my favorite 
Tennessee Williams play.' 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of plays that you read you think will be so much fun to  
perform and end up being very, very difficult. They don't play 
well. The great thing about Tennessee Williams is that when you say 
it out loud it becomes fun -- obvious and clear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the lures of Williamstown for well-known actors is that  
they don't have to commit for a long periods. On Broadway, 
producers usually want a commitment of at least six months. Here 
actors are employed for three weeks of rehearsals and two of 
performances. It helps that many of the actors and directors have 
worked together before. 
</P>
<P>
	Some see the short preparation time as a blessing.  
</P>
<P>
	``You can't afford to be cautious here. You just have to jump  
in,'' says Brown, who plays Marguerite, the Camille-like character 
in ``Camino Real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The intensity of it is what is fun. You can work on a movie  
and spend 15 minutes a day acting. Here you spend all day doing 
it,'' says Hawke, star of such films as ``Dead Poets Society'' and 
``Reality Bites.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin already had Hawke, Brown and Davis in mind when he went  
to Ritchie with the idea of doing ``Camino Real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paltrow and Ritchie had been talking for four years about plays  
she might do at Williamstown. Among the half-dozen under 
consideration: ``Trelawny of the Wells'' and ``The Philadelphia 
Story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paltrow told him she got a great kick from being exposed to  
Shakespeare in ``Shakespeare in Love'' and being around the movie's 
English actors and their passion for the bard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think she finds a great comfort level here,'' Ritchie says.  
``It is almost like her second home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one does it for the money.  
</P>
<P>
	``I hate to say this, but I've lost more money in a poker game  
than I've made in my weekly paycheck here,'' says Kind, the 
nebbishy press secretary on ABC's ``Spin City,'' who is appearing 
in Tom Stoppard's ``Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a communal activity here,'' says Kind, relaxing in a  
college coffee bar before a late morning golf game. ``A summer camp 
for actors, in the best sense. There is a dignity and a purity to 
the work -- washing your hands from the grime of show business. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a privilege to come up here -- because we get to fail. We  
don't come to fail, but if we do, the consequences are not as 
great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nor are the financial consequences -- which makes it perfect for  
trying out new plays such as ``Glimmer Brothers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There is something great about being away from New York,''  
says playwright Leight. ``Actors aren't running to check their 
answering machines every 10 minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leight's play concerns 65-year-old twins, who, at one time, were  
both jazz musicians. One got out of the business, the other stayed. 
Now they are seeing each other for the first time in 40 years. 
Schwimmer stars as godson of one of the brothers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ritchie has a yearly budget of about $2 million, 60 percent from  
ticket sales or its training program, which has 90 apprentices. 
Contributions make up the rest of the funding. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do here what no one else can do. We have the talent pool on  
every level, from actors, directors and playwrights of high stature 
to those apprentices,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Being a stage manager, in charge of making sure a show was up  
and running for each performance, was an invaluable experience for 
Ritchie. 
</P>
<P>
	He worked on good shows and bad, not much caring if they bombed.  
``I was on the sidelines watching, getting a good idea of what it 
takes to put a play on the stage. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a stage manager, you have to keep track of order while  
chaos is going on around you,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Ritchie says he produces shows only for his Williamstown  
audience, without thinking of whether they will have a life after 
the summer. ``But if we do it well here, someone else is going to 
say, `That should get a wider exposure.' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this season has great potential to be successful,''  
the producer says. With stars like Paltrow, ``It certainly has 
notoriety already. That doesn't hurt. But at the end of the season 
I want it to be notable for what we did, not just who was here.''

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler May Buy Volvo Units </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler is reportedly talking  
about buying Volvo AB's remaining manufacturing operations which 
include making trucks, buses and construction equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	The business daily Dagens Industri, citing unnamed sources,  
reported Wednesday that the German automaker is expected to bid 
between $17.7 billion and $18.9 billion for the remaining Volvo 
businesses which also include marine and aerospace operations. 
</P>
<P>
	That would be a hefty premium over Volvo's recent market value  
of about $12.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	But DaimlerChrysler spokesman Eckhard Zanger strongly denied the  
report. ``We are not in talks and don't plan a merger with Volvo,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo spokesman Per Loejdkvist said he had no comment on the  
Dagens Industri report, but added: ``Everyone is talking to 
everyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors about a sale of the remainder of Volvo have surfaced  
before and with buyers other than DaimlerChrysler. 
</P>
<P>
	Swedish-based Volvo sold its passenger car division to Ford for  
$6.45 billion last January. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said DaimlerChrysler would be willing to pay a  
premium because it expects it could save $1.2 billion a year, and 
because Volvo has about $5.9 billion in cash after the Ford deal. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler's offer was expected to consist of stock,  
meaning Volvo's stockholders would become owners of 14 percent to 
15 percent of the German automaker, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said the headquarters for the planned subsidiary --  
tentatively called Mercedes Volvo Buses, Trucks &AMP; Heavy Equipment -- 
would likely be in Goteborg, Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	If the reported deal occurs, Volvo was expected to sell its 22  
percent stake in truck and bus manufacturer Scania, worth about 
$1.2 billion.

<HEADLINE> House Debates Flag Desecration Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A constitutional amendment on flag desecration  
was moving through the House today, for the third time in four 
years. As in the past, however, it appeared headed for defeat in 
the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17-word amendment would allow Congress to ban the physical  
desecration of the flag. House approval was expected in a vote 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters argue that Congress must be given that constitutional  
authority to supersede a 5-4 vote by the Supreme Court in 1989 
invalidating the flag protection laws of 48 states. In 1990 the 
court struck down a congressional act on flag desecration, again 
ruling it violated First Amendment free speech rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The House passed the amendment with 312 votes in 1995 and 310  
votes in 1997, both well above the two-thirds majority needed to 
approve an amendment to the Constitution. Three-fourths of state 
legislatures also must ratify a proposed amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Senate vote in 1995 was 63-36, short of the two-thirds  
majority, and the Senate did not take up the issue in the last 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate did take one flag-related action Wednesday, approving  
without opposition a resolution to begin each day with recitation 
of the Pledge of Allegiance. The House starts its day with both a 
prayer, also a Senate practice, and a member reciting the pledge. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the flag amendment in the House, led by Rep. Randy  
Cunningham, R-Calif., said the flag must be protected because it is 
a unique symbol that binds America together. Opponents counter that 
acts of destruction against the flag are rare and do not warrant an 
amendment they say would limit the right of free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Backers were confident this time they had the votes, but they  
suffered a setback when two undecided senators, North Dakota 
Democrats Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad, recently said they thought 
they could offer legislation that would pass constitutional muster, 
removing the need to change the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Carole Shields of the People for the American Way, a liberal  
group that opposes the amendment, said House members could vote for 
the amendment knowing that it would be defeated in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``They know it's not going to be decided in the House. It's easy  
for them to take a safe vote,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ret. Maj. Gen. Patrick Brady, chairman of the Citizens' Flag  
Alliance, said the House vote would reflect the nation's strong 
support of action to protect the flag. ``The House is the body 
closest to the people and I think they are responding to the 
people,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brady noted that 49 state legislatures have approved resolutions  
backing the amendment. His group, sponsored in chief by the 
American Legion and made up of 140 organizations, has been running 
ads in North Dakota to press the senators to change their minds and 
Brady said it still had hope of winning in the Senate.

<HEADLINE> Banks Share Online Billing Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Three of the nation's top banks are creating an  
online network that can deliver all of a consumer's monthly bills 
to the Web site that handles his or her checking account. 
</P>
<P>
	Chase Manhattan, First Union and Wells Fargo hope the joint  
venture, announced Wednesday, will speed the shift away from the 
time-consuming and costly process of printing bills, mailing them 
out, and waiting for a check to arrive and clear. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the three banks hope to position themselves at  
the focal point of a new market with huge profit potential. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers can already view many of their monthly bills on the  
Internet, but not through a single Web site operated by the bank or 
brokerage where they manage their money. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, most need to visit each merchant's Web site  
individually. Then, if they want to pay any of those bills online, 
they usually need to set up a credit card or checking account 
authorization at each particular Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	``The average American gets 12 to 17 bills a month. The  
likelihood that they would go to 12 to 17 places to get those bills 
is low,'' said June Felix, a senior vice president at Chase. 
</P>
<P>
	Chase, First Union and Wells are not the first to try and tap  
the riches of consolidating that process under one roof. The two 
most prominent players are Checkfree, whose shares tumbled more 
than 20 percent after the announcement Wednesday, and Transpoint, a 
partnership between Microsoft and First Data Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The new network, as yet unnamed, is expected to be operating by  
the fall with Chase, First Union and Wells as the first three 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun Microsystems will develop the technology for the network,  
which also will use software from the credit card company Visa 
U.S.A. No financial details of the joint venture were disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	With a combined 60 million accounts serving consumers and small  
businesses, the three banks may have a strong head start in getting 
vendors such as phone companies or department stores to funnel 
their electronic bills through the new network. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, by signing up enough vendors, the partners hope to  
attract rival banks, brokerages and other financial institutions 
that want to offer customers one-stop billing at their Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	That way, even if people do their banking elsewhere, the network  
would act as an electronic ``middleman,'' charging fees to carry 
online bills and payments between vendors and financial 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the advantage posed by their vast base of customers,  
Chase, First Union and Wells won't necessarily monopolize the 
market for electronic billing and payment, said Michael Herd, 
spokesman for the National Automated Clearing House Association, a 
not-for-profit industry group. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, a handful of dominant players might emerge in much the  
same way that a few major networks operate the vast majority of ATM 
cash machines, he said.

<HEADLINE> Senate Panel Cuts Money for Parks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Senate subcommittee is handing a victory to  
mining interests by restricting a Clinton administration effort to 
limit waste dumping at hard-rock mines and trimming a White House 
plan to buy more land for parks. 
</P>
<P>
	Both provisions were included in a $13.9 billion bill financing  
the Interior Department and federal cultural programs for fiscal 
2000, which begins Oct. 1. A subcommittee of the Senate 
Appropriations Committee used a voice vote to approve the 
legislation, which would give President Clinton $1.2 billion less 
than he requested. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote came as Capitol Hill budget experts said Republicans  
will receive mildly good news next week from the Congressional 
Budget Office. They said the budget office will project, for the 
first time in decades, a surplus next year on the non-Social 
Security side of the federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
	That surplus will be between $5 billion and $10 billion, said  
one congressional analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity. It 
is important because while Republicans have promised not to use 
Social Security surpluses for anything but the pension program, 
they want to use the non-Social Security surplus for extra spending 
or to help finance a tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	The money would not be enough to provide a dramatic tax  
reduction or bridge the roughly $30 billion spending gap between 
what Clinton and Republicans want, but it would help. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton proposed spending $1 billion next year for what he  
labeled his ``lands legacy'' initiative, which would finance land 
purchases by the federal, state and local governments for 
conservation and recreation. It was one of the major new proposals 
of Clinton's fiscal 2000 budget released in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Though not all of that spending was in the jurisdiction of the  
subcommittee, the bill would trim a $412 million piece of it to 
$237 million. Subcommittee Chairman Slade Gorton, R-Wash., said the 
cut was being made so there would be more money ``to keep operating 
what we already have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senators also added language that would exempt some mines from a  
1997 Interior Department ruling limiting the amount of land that 
mining operations can use to process or dump waste. 
</P>
<P>
	The provision, offered by Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., would exempt  
existing waste sites. Reid said the measure would affect hundreds 
of such operations in the country, mostly western gold mines. He 
said 70 percent of the nation's gold is produced in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a big step,'' said Reid.  
</P>
<P>
	Defenders say the provision protects mining companies that have  
operated waste sites since well before the Interior Department 
ruling. But environmental groups say the Reid language would weaken 
the 1872 law that regulates mining, a law environmentalists have 
long criticized for being too generous to mining interests. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are reforming the only piece of the 1872 law that  
protects the public interest,'' said Lexi Shultz, staff attorney 
for the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid based his amendment on a letter he received from Interior  
Secretary Bruce Babbitt, who wrote that he did intend to block 
mining operations that have already been approved. The language 
does not address mines that wish to add additional waste sites, or 
companies that have not yet had mining permits approved. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would also provide $1 million increases for both the  
National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the 
Humanities, which have been attacked by conservatives in recent 
years for financing objectionable projects. Gorton said the 
increases ``show our support for those programs,'' which would, 
respectively, have budgets of $99 million and $112 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The House has not yet written its version of the bill.

<HEADLINE> Austin Powers Doll Angers Mother </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A suburban Atlanta mom has a message for the  
makers of a new Austin Powers doll: Oh, behave! 
</P>
<P>
	Tamatha Brannon wants retailers to stop selling the doll, which  
repeats some of the movie superspy's trademark lines including: 
``Do I make you horny, baby? Do I?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brannon was incensed when her 11-year-old son picked a doll up  
in a Toys R Us last week and pestered her about what ``horny'' 
meant. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't believe this toy is approved for ages 10 and up,'' she  
said Tuesday. ``It's perverted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The underwear-clad dolls with gorilla-like chest hair don't  
speak unless they're removed from the packaging, but the quotation 
is written on the box. 
</P>
<P>
	McFarlane Toys, which manufactures the doll, also makes a fully  
clothed doll with ``softer'' quotes from the PG-13 rated, ``Austin 
Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company said the adult version of the doll is only available  
at record stores and novelty shops that cater to an older audience. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given that we ship millions of toys all over the world, it's  
certainly possible one case ended up to the left or to the right of 
where it should have been,'' president and CEO Todd McFarlane said 
from his Tempe, Ariz., office. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Toys R Us headquarters in Paramus, N.J., on Tuesday  
asked stores to pull any of the more risque dolls from the shelves. 
</P>
<P>
	Toys R Us spokeswoman Rebecca Caruso said the retailer had  
bought the ``softer'' version of the dolls.

<HEADLINE> Hatch Preparing for 2000 Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, a late entrant into the  
GOP presidential race, has made no campaign trips, has yet to begin 
raising money in earnest and is just now hiring his first two aides 
in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, the front-running George W. Bush has raised more  
than $13 million, has a staff of 60 aides and offices in New 
Hampshire, Iowa and Texas. Governors, congressmen and senators by 
the dozen have lined up to endorse him. 
</P>
<P>
	And Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio -- like Hatch and numerous others  
trying to establish themselves as a leading alternative to Bush -- 
has been to Iowa nine times this year to campaign for the 
first-in-the-nation caucuses next year. The Ohio Republican has a 
staff of approximately 30 aides, as well as offices in Washington, 
Iowa, New Hampshire -- site of the first primary next year -- and 
Columbus in his home state. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch's late entry into the race ``creates certain impediments  
to a campaign,'' top adviser Sal Russo conceded Wednesday. ``But 
realistically, voters are totally unfocused'' on the field of 
contenders thus far, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The 65-year-old senator, Russo said, ``combines that Ronald  
Reagan vision of a shining city on the hill, economic growth and 
opportunity with the experience in the Senate of crossing party 
lines and ideological spectrums to get things done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My life has been filled with impossibilities,'' Hatch told  
reporters this week. ``My life has been filled with miracles. I 
believe in miracles. It would probably take that to elect me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like others in the race, Hatch said he wants to be in a position  
to capitalize if Bush stumbles. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast to the other contenders, some of whom have been  
campaigning for months, Hatch issued his first campaign press 
release Wednesday, announcing the hiring of Ken Egan and Patrick 
Hynes in New Hampshire. And while the announcement bore the 
inscription ``paid for and authorized by Orrin Hatch for president 
exploratory committee,'' a spokesman said the formal paperwork to 
establish the committee has not yet been filed. 
</P>
<P>
	One Republican source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said  
Hatch, who is Mormon, hopes to attract a network of Mormon donors 
to help him in the early going. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time Hatch moves ahead with his presidential bid,  
his Senate spokesman, Paul Smith, said the Utah Republican will run 
for a fifth Senate term next year. Under a newly enacted state law, 
he is permitted to do so and would have to give up his spot on the 
state ballot only if he wins the presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch is chairman of the Judiciary Committee and a shoo-in for  
re-election in his conservative, Republican-dominated state. 
</P>
<P>
	He got a cold reception to the presidential race from the camp  
of one rival. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyn Nofziger, who advises Pat Buchanan, said, ``I think Orrin  
Hatch is a tool of George W. Bush. He picks up the Mormon 
conservative vote that otherwise would go to Pat and Gary Bauer. 
The votes will be split, allowing Bush to go into some of these 
states and win without much of a fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Within the Senate, Hatch has shown an ability both to cooperate  
with Democrats and to fight them. He held up all of President 
Clinton's judicial nominees for months this year in hopes of 
gaining a nomination to the bench for a fellow Utahn. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet he angered many Republicans last winter when he suggested --  
in advance of Clinton's impeachment -- that a censure or some other 
lesser form of penalty be considered. Hatch eventually voted to 
convict Clinton on both impeachment charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch grew up in Pittsburgh. He told reporters recently that he  
had worked as a janitor as he paid his way through college. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did have an impoverished background and can appreciate not  
only the hopes and dreams of people but also their fears and 
worries,'' said Russo.

<HEADLINE> $1.5B Asbestos Settlement Set Aside </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today set aside a $1.5  
billion settlement of the Fibreboard Corp.'s legal liability for 
asbestos-related claims, a major decision for efforts to resolve 
massive product-liability lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, by a 7-2 vote, ruled that a federal judge in Texas  
wrongly allowed a class-action settlement involving Fibreboard, a 
vinyl siding manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
	The new guidelines may make it more difficult for manufacturers  
and other defendants to obtain settlements of lawsuits such as 
those over breast implants, cigarettes and other allegedly 
dangerous products. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's decision ends the court's 1998-1999 term. The court  
begins its 1999-2000 term on the first Monday of October. 
</P>
<P>
	The court also delivered a major decision states' rights today,  
holding that state governments cannot be sued against their will in 
state courts by people seeking to enforce some federal right. 
</P>
<P>
	By a 5-4 vote, the justices killed a state court lawsuit by  
dozens of state probation officers seeking to enforce a federal 
labor law and collect overtime pay from Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Writing for the court in the asbestos case, Justice David H.  
Souter said that in such proposed settlements in which a limited 
amount of money is available, those seeking the settlement ``must 
show that the fund is limited by more than the agreement of the 
parties, and has been allocated to claimants belonging within the 
class by a process addressing any conflicting interests of class 
members.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``With Fibreboard retaining nearly all its net worth, it hardly  
appears that such a regime is the best that can be provided for 
class members,'' Souter added. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas-based Fibreboard, a subsidiary of Owens Corning,  
manufactures vinyl siding and other building materials at 21 plants 
in the United States and Canada. Its products once contained 
asbestos, for decades used extensively in insulation and 
fireproofing before it was linked to severe and sometimes deadly 
respiratory problems. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, U.S. District Judge Robert Parker in Tyler, Texas,  
approved a so-called global settlement of about 186,000 potential 
future claims and several related agreements negotiated by 
Fibreboard, its insurers and some people with asbestos-related 
health claims. Parker has since been elevated to the 5th U.S. 
Circuit Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement was upheld by the 5th Circuit court, but the  
Supreme Court last June told the appeals court to restudy the case 
in light of a 1997 ruling in which the justices made it more 
difficult to find nationwide solutions in massive product-liability 
litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	That decision said judges lack the authority to allow a  
class-action settlement in a lawsuit that, under federal rules of 
civil procedure, would be denied class-action status at trial. 
</P>
<P>
	After restudying the Fibreboard case in light of the 1997  
Supreme Court ruling, a three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit court 
again upheld the $1.5 billion global settlement, by a 2-1 vote. 
</P>
<P>
	People opposed to the settlement then successfully sought  
Supreme Court review, accusing the appeals court of 
``insubordination'' by essentially ignoring the 1997 ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the justices said the appeals court was wrong.  
</P>
<P>
	Joining Souter's opinion were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist  
and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. 
Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. 
</P>
<P>
	Rehnquist wrote a concurring opinion that said the federal judge  
made ``near-heroic efforts ... to make the best of a bad 
situation.'' But he said the court was restricted by federal civil 
trial rules, adding that the situation ``cries out for a 
legislative solution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dissenting were Justices Stephen G. Breyer and John Paul  
Stevens. Writing for the two, Breyer said that in complicated cases 
such as asbestos claims, ``our court should allow a district court 
full authority to exercise every bit of discretionary power that 
the law provides.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Fibreboard dispute actually began with a protracted battle  
in California state courts between the manufacturer and its 
insurers over coverage for asbestos-related liability. Fibreboard 
sued in federal court in Texas in 1992, seeking resolution not only 
of the insurance issues but also a global settlement of all 
asbestos claims against it. 
</P>
<P>
	Esteban Ortiz and others with asbestos-related claims intervened  
in the Texas case in 1994 and objected to the proposed settlement 
that the trial judge later approved. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Ortiz vs. Fibreboard, 97-1704.  
</P>
<P>
	In the states' rights case, the court ruled that the  
Constitution's ``structure and history'' shields states not only 
from being sued in federal courts, but also makes them immune from 
individuals' state court lawsuits seeking to enforce a federal 
right. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision leaves Maine's probation officers with a federally  
protected right to be paid for overtime work but with no way to 
enforce that right besides trying to get the federal government to 
sue the state for them. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision continues a recent trend at the nation's highest  
court. In a series of cases decided by 5-4 votes, the justices have 
shown increasing sensitivity to how individual states' authority 
fares when pitted against the federal government's power. 
</P>
<P>
	The conservative coalition of Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist  
and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. 
Kennedy and Clarence Thomas again prevailed today over more liberal 
colleagues, Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer.

<HEADLINE> Hatch Preparing for 2000 Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, who says it probably  
would take a miracle for him to win the White House, intends to 
seek re-election to Congress at the same time he makes a late 
entrance into the Republican presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	One day after saying he will join the GOP race dominated by  
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, Hatch also announced the hiring of his 
first two aides in New Hampshire. Both men will resign their jobs 
with the state GOP to join Hatch's first-in-the nation primary 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	One senior adviser, Sal Russo, said Hatch had been discussing a  
possible race for some time, and had decided to move ahead after 
reviewing the results of a survey taken by Richard Wirthlin, the 
veteran Republican pollster. 
</P>
<P>
	Russo, a consultant who works in California, said that besides  
the funds raised for the poll, Hatch had only begun raising 
campaign money in the last few days. Another GOP official, who 
spoke on condition of anonymity, said Hatch, a Mormon, hopes to be 
able to create a network of Mormon donors to fuel his early 
campaign effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Republicans who have spoken to Hatch in recent days said  
the senator is realistic about the odds facing him, particularly 
given Bush's overwhelming advantages in fund-raising and his 
widespread backing by the GOP establishment. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch indicated as much in comments to reporters on Tuesday.  
``My life has been filled with impossibilities,'' he said. ``My 
life has been filled with miracles. I believe in miracles. It would 
probably take that to elect me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like others in the race, Hatch said he wants to be in a position  
to capitalize if Bush stumbles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The voters haven't focused yet,'' said Russo, adding that none  
of the other contenders in the race has succeeded in solidifying a 
base of support in the conservative wing of the party. 
</P>
<P>
	Russo conceded there were ``certain impediments'' to a campaign  
starting as late as Hatch's. 
</P>
<P>
	And the logisitical ground to be made up is considerable.  
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Kasich, who is also hoping to emerge as an alternative  
to Bush, has a staff of roughly 20 aides, and offices in New 
Hampshire and Iowa as well as Washington and Columbus, the capital 
of his home state of Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich has made nine separate campaign trips to New Hampshire  
since January, according to Todd Harris, a campaign spokesman who 
was added to the payroll on Jan. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who has raised more than $15 million thus far, enjoys the  
support of more than 100 House members and more than a dozen 
senators, many of whom met with him yesterday. His candidacy also 
has been embraced by more than a dozen fellow governors, all of 
whom can provide political assistance when their states hold 
primaries. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, Hatch issued his first campaign press release  
during the day, announcing the hiring of Ken Egan and Patrick Hynes 
in New Hampshire. And while the announcement bore the inscription 
``paid for and authorized by Orrin Hatch for president exploratory 
committee,'' a spokesman said the formal paperwork to establish the 
committee has not yet been filed. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time Hatch moves ahead with his presidential bid,  
his Senate spokesman, Paul Smith, said the Utah Republican will run 
for a fifth Senate term next year. Under a newly enacted state law, 
he is permitted to do so, and would have to give up his spot on the 
state ballot only if he wins the presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch, 65, is chairman of the Judiciary Committee and in his  
fourth Senate term. He is a shoo-in for re-election in his 
conservative, Republican-dominated state. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch got a cold reception to the presidential race from the  
camp of one rival. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyn Nofziger, who advises Pat Buchanan, said, ``I think Orrin  
Hatch is a tool of George W. Bush. He picks up the Mormon 
conservative vote that otherwise would go to Pat and Gary Bauer. 
The votes will be split, allowing Bush to go into some of these 
states and win without much of a fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Within the Senate, Hatch has shown an ability both to cooperate  
with Democrats and to fight them. He held up all of President 
Clinton's judicial nominees for months this year in hopes of 
gaining a nomination to the bench for a fellow Utahn. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet he angered many Republicans last winter when he suggested --  
in advance of Clinton's impeachment -- that a censure or some other 
lesser form of penalty be considered. Hatch eventually voted to 
convict Clinton on both impeachment charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch grew up in Pittsburgh, and told reporters recently he had  
worked as a janitor as he paid his own way through college. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did have an impoverished background and can appreciate not  
only the hopes and dreams of people but also their fears and 
worries,'' said Russo.

<HEADLINE> Congress Asked To Aid Extradition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A man who lost his wife in a bloody murder  
witnessed by his four toddlers begged Congress for help today in 
pressuring the Mexican government to extradite the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	His voice at times quaking with emotion, James J. Bellush said  
he and his children have waited since November 1997 to see Jose 
Luis Del Toro Jr. brought to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please do not allow Sheila to have died in vain,'' Bellush  
asked members of the House Government Reform Committee's criminal 
justice, drug policy and human resources subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying he was outraged by the delay, subcommittee Chairman John  
Mica, R-Fla., ordered staff to write to the Justice and State 
departments asking what they had done on the case and urging them 
to do more. He said he might even subpoena Attorney General Janet 
Reno and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to testify before 
the subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	State and Justice officials at Wednesday's hearing said Del  
Toro's extradition is working its way slowly through the Mexican 
court system. 
</P>
<P>
	During the hearing, Bellush brought subcommittee members close  
to tears as he told them how his 13-year-old stepdaughter 
discovered her 35-year-old mother lying dead on the kitchen floor 
of their Sarasota, Fla., home on Nov. 7, 1997. She had been shot in 
the face and her throat had been slit. Her 23-month-old quadruplets 
were huddled together crying. Police said they apparently had been 
alone with their mother's body for long as six hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators believe she was killed by a hired murderer. Two  
people have been convicted for their roles in the crime, and 
authorities say they have compelling evidence against Del Toro, a 
U.S. citizen who was arrested weeks after the slaying in Monterey, 
Mexico. He was in Mexico illegally. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have been frustrated by the long wait for his  
extradition. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexican authorities first said they would deport Del Toro to the  
United States, said Florida State Attorney Earl Moreland, who 
prosecutes crimes in DeSoto, Manatee and Sarasota counties. But the 
day he was supposed to be handed over at the Texas-Mexico border, 
the Mexican government said he had been taken to Mexico City 
instead and that U.S. officials should seek extradition, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. Department of Justice informed me that the Mexican  
government would not extradite Del Toro unless I would give 
assurance that Del Toro would not receive the death penalty if 
extradited,'' Moreland said. ``We agreed to waive the death penalty 
after talking with Mr. Bellush and filed the necessary papers with 
the Justice Department.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State and Justice officials said the problem is that Del Toro  
has been vigorously fighting extradition, filing numerous legal 
challenges that must be heard in Mexico's courts. The Mexican legal 
system gives defendants many more opportunities for appeals and 
objections that the U.S. system does, said Deputy Assistant 
Attorney General Mary Lee Warren and Jamison Borek, a State 
Department deputy legal adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	Bellush said the quads -- now 4 years old -- still remember the  
scene. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tell Timmy, Joey, Frankie and Courtney that Mommy is in  
heaven with Jesus,'' he said. ``They ask me if she is still 
bleeding.''

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Chief Expects 24 Hour Trades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nasdaq chief Frank Zarb has a vision of what  
the global stock market will be in a few years: digital, open 24 
hours, letting people make trades instantly anywhere from their 
computers, cellphones, pagers and handheld organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech Wednesday at the National Press Club, Zarb -- the  
chairman of the National Association of Securities Dealers, which 
operates the electronic Nasdaq Stock Market -- said officials are 
examining of number of structural shifts to allow it to compete in 
the market of the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Zarb said NASD is considering separating out its regulatory  
division and merging it with the New York Stock Exchange's for both 
quality and financial reasons. Zarb also noted that Nasdaq was 
considering going private by selling stock in itself to key 
investment firms and possibly later to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq chief's comments come at a time when the global  
financial markets are expanding in an unprecedented manner. Only 
last week, Zarb announced last week plans to establish a trading 
exchange similar to Nasdaq's in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq also has set up a joint Web site with Hong Kong's stock  
exchange that will allow U.S. investors to trade in Hong Kong 
securities, has signed a similar deal with the Australian Stock 
Exchange, and is looking into new alliances in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Zarb said extended trading hours soon will be a reality because  
``investors want it. ... People want to be able to trade their 
personal stock portfolios at a time convenient to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Ideally, extended hours shouldn't be implemented piecemeal by  
(stock) exchanges or the new electronic communications networks 
that trade stocks,'' Zarb urged in his speech. ``Investors would be 
best served if the industry could move to new hours in a 
coordinated way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE voted this month to extend trading hours, but not until  
the second half of next year. Before the NYSE expands its hours it 
wants first to ensure there are no glitches with the Year 2000 
computer bug and the planned switch to reporting stock prices in 
decimals instead of fractions. 
</P>
<P>
	The go-slow decision came a week after Nasdaq voted to begin  
extending its hours into the evening as soon as this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which is expected  
to eventually approve proposals for extended trading hours, 
announced Wednesday it was convening a financial industry 
``summit'' on the issue with Zarb's securities dealers' group and 
the NYSE. The June 30 meeting will be closed to the public and the 
press, an SEC spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The global expansion by the world's second-largest stock market  
has sharpened its competition with the largest, the NYSE, which 
uses a traditional trading floor. Nasdaq also recently took over 
the American Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The two exchanges may be able to help one another if they merged  
their regulatory operations, Zarb said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A high-tech, independent single regulator, jointly owned by  
the markets, with advanced electronic surveillance could be better 
for investors, markets and the securities industry. This could 
lessen costs and increase depth of regulation, as well as eliminate 
potential conflicts of interest between regulators and the stock 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the NYSE had no immediate comment on the proposal.  
</P>
<P>
	Zarb, looking a few years ahead, said ``trading floors and  
paper, for the most part, will be rendered obsolete by competition 
and technology. ... This 21st-century stock market will be ... 
computer screen-based, technology-driven and open to all -- all 
because people will have access to information that they want to 
act on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People will be able to get instant stock quotes and trades  
anytime day or night, he said, using computers, cellphones, pagers 
and hand-held organizers. They'll even be able to get personalized 
reports on the performance of their investments from their car 
radios and digital TVs at home, he said.

<HEADLINE> House OKs Transportation Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Conservatives won cuts in aviation programs  
today as the House approved a $44.5 billion transportation bill for 
the coming fiscal year. But it is uncertain how much of the 
reduction will survive. 
</P>
<P>
	The House adopted the overall measure by 429-3 after a $5.9  
billion section paying the salaries of the nation's air traffic 
controllers and air safety inspectors was removed from the bill on 
procedural grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the bill contains increases of hundreds of millions of  
dollars for airports and aviation systems, road building and mass 
transit. 
</P>
<P>
	The full Senate has yet to consider its version of the measure.  
</P>
<P>
	Conservatives who killed the one section acknowledged that most  
of the Federal Aviation Administration funds will be restored when 
House-Senate bargainers write a compromise bill later. They said 
their goal was for congressional bargainers to produce a final bill 
totaling less than the House figure. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't saying we don't want an FAA,'' said Rep. Tom  
Coburn, R-Okla., who successfully moved to strike the language. 
``Our goal is to get spending under control in the House, and at 
the same time to have adequate funds for the FAA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Airport safety won't be eliminated,'' said Rep. Bill Young,  
R-Fla., chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, which 
produced the original bill. ``When the process is completed, the 
FAA, the safety of airways, will be in good shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The provision was eliminated for the technical reason that the  
FAA's legal authority to function has not yet been renewed by 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers often ignore such technicalities, but Coburn used it  
to set the groundwork for possible cuts. He and other conservatives 
have been forcing reductions in the first few spending bills the 
House has produced, arguing that Republicans have pledged to 
control spending and not use Social Security surpluses to beef up 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	By voice vote, the House also agreed to cut $300 million from  
the bill in excess airport improvement funds. Young said most of 
the money wouldn't have been spent anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservatives won another symbolic reduction: a $1 million cut  
from the $158 million proposed for Transportation Department 
administrative functions. 
</P>
<P>
	By 241-190, the House also approved an amendment by Rep. James  
Rogan, R-Calif., that would block federal funds for a long-proposed 
extension of the 710 freeway through Pasadena and South Pasadena, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogan hopes his language will kill the planned 4 1/2-mile project.  
Supporters of the road say it would speed traffic in the area, but 
opponents say it would divide neighborhoods and mean the 
destruction of scores of historic homes and trees.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Panel Secrecy Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Proposed rules that would allow the Salt  
Lake Organizing Committee to close meetings and withhold records 
have come under attack from media lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Loopholes would allow SLOC, which promised openness in the wake  
of the Salt Lake vote buying scandal, to close meetings and 
withhold records under almost any circumstance, said Michael 
O'Brien, who represents The Salt Lake Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, meetings in which SLOC attorneys offer advice on  
legal issues could be closed. And the information officer could not 
release documents that ``may injure SLOC, either in terms of legal 
liability or in competitive position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien said these give SLOC ``the appearance of openness  
without the reality of openness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to SLOC's policy committee, he asked that the  
loopholes be closed. ``We don't want the left hand to take away the 
openness that the right hand seems to be giving,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The policy committee was supposed to meet today to fine-tune the  
rules, but only two of five members were available and the meeting 
was canceled. It has not been rescheduled yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey Hunt, who represents three newspapers, four television  
stations and the Utah Chapter of the Society of Professional 
Journalists, was critical of the proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	People should have access to SLOC's full budget, not just a  
budget summary, he said. Other documents Hunt wants made public 
include SLOC's quarterly unaudited financial reports, 
conflict-of-interest disclosures, official reports to the U.S. and 
international Olympic committees, a list of business executives on 
loan to SLOC and quarterly merchandising sales figures. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC President Mitt Romney said his organization is more open  
than any other outside of the government. 
</P>
<P>
	``I answer to a 50-member board, a 20-member management  
committee, several subcommittees, two legislative oversight boards, 
a state Olympic officer, the (U.S. Olympic Committee) and the 
(International Olympic Committee),'' he said. ``Certainly, there 
was a lack of scrutiny of the bid committee. But how much of an 
overcorrection do we as a community want to take?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In some respects, SLOC is breaking new ground, Romney said.  
``We're taking a private corporation and subjecting it to 
public-type openness policies. And we don't have any models as to 
how this works.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although a private organization, SLOC has borrowed $59 million  
in funds from the state to build venues. In addition, Salt Lake 
City had to agree in writing to cover SLOC's debts. For these 
reasons, the attorneys argue, SLOC should be subject to more public 
scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney said SLOC must consider respect for personal and  
corporate rights of privacy, and the expense of implementation of 
openness. 
</P>
<P>
	``Say somebody wants a chronological list of all letters written  
by SLOC. That request would cost us probably $1 million. Well, 
that's just nuts,'' Romney said. 
</P>
<P>
	If companies could learn by perusing the budget how much money  
SLOC has earmarked for a particular contract, they might ratchet 
their bids upward. And vendors could bump their prices if they 
discovered through expense reports that others had negotiated 
better deals. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my view, one of the reasons government pays $600 for a  
hammer is that companies who do business with government know 
everything will be seen by their competitors,'' Romney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney said it would be unfair to require SLOC employees and  
board members to disclose their personal business interests. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic sponsors negotiated confidential agreements, and if the  
terms of those contracts are disclosed, SLOC leaders could be sued.

<HEADLINE> Hawaii Property Values Plunge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- The past year has been a far cry from the late  
1980s, when high-flying Japanese were knocking on doors in ritzy 
neighborhoods and offering suitcases of cash for luxury homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's stagnation through most of the '90s has burst Hawaii's  
real estate bubble, sending the values of commercial properties and 
some homes plunging by more than half. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese companies that paid steep prices for resort and retail  
properties had tried to hold onto them, but that changed when 
Japanese banks, under pressure from the government, began demanding 
repayment of overdue loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Not just Hawaii has been affected. Japanese have had to bail out  
of real estate projects across the United States, and the economic 
crisis that hit much of Asia two years ago has caused other sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the big properties sold by Asians in the last year are the  
Essex House in New York and the ANA Hotel in San Francisco, and 
Arco Towers office complex in downtown Los Angeles and the 
exclusive Pebble Beach golf club near Carmel, Calif., are 
reportedly on the block. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawaii has seen a spate of sales of big properties, notably the  
highly profitable Ala Moana Shopping Center just outside Waikiki 
and the posh Grand Wailea Resort &AMP; Spa on Maui. 
</P>
<P>
	Other sold properties include the Kona Surf Resort on Hawaii  
Island, the Westin Maui in Kaanapali and the Turtle Bay Hilton Golf 
&AMP; Tennis Resort on Oahu's north shore. 
</P>
<P>
	All were sold for less than what the Japanese paid for them --  
sometimes hundreds of millions of dollars less. 
</P>
<P>
	``They paid much too much for these properties,'' said Lowell  
Kalapa of the non-profit Tax Foundation of Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the Westin Maui was bought last year by Starwood  
Hotels &AMP; Resorts for $132 million, less than half the $290 million 
that Kaukani Corp. of Japan paid in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The Grand Wailea, built for $600 million in 1990 by Takeshi  
Sekiguchi and considered one of the world's top resorts, was sold 
to KSL Recreation Corp. last year for between $275 million and $310 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	There are two driving forces behind the increase in sales of  
overseas properties by Japanese companies, said Simon Atkinson, a 
real estate analyst for ABN Amro Securities Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	First, overseas properties often are peripheral to the  
companies' main businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why Daiei Inc., the largest supermarket operator in  
Japan, decided to unload the Ala Moana Shopping Center, the largest 
and most profitable in Hawaii. The mall was sold to Chicago-based 
General Growth Properties Inc. for $810 million, far under the $1 
billion Daiei sought. 
</P>
<P>
	Second, the bulk of Japanese companies' overseas properties are  
in the United States, where the real estate market is prospering. 
So even though the companies may be losing money on sales, they are 
losing less than they would selling holdings in other parts of the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	``Japanese companies are taking advantage of stronger conditions  
in U.S. markets in order to reduce their debts,'' Atkinson said. 
``I would expect it to continue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Sklarz, head of research at Prudential Locations in  
Hawaii, said the Japanese are finding willing buyers in individual 
Americans and U.S. companies flush with cash from stock market 
gains and a decade-long economic boom on the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
	While the buyers are getting good deals, Hawaii taxpayers may  
not be. 
</P>
<P>
	The resulting lower property valuations likely will cause  
problems for Hawaii's four county governments, which rely heavily 
on property taxes for their revenue, Kalapa said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said county officials didn't lower tax rates enough to  
restrain government spending when property values were soaring, and 
he warned that counties now will have to raise taxes or cut 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``The counties are between a rock and a hard place,'' Kalapa  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The City and County of Honolulu's budget for fiscal year  
1999-2000 includes a property tax increase, the second consecutive 
year officials have had to raise rates to maintain revenues and 
offset the plunge in property valuations. 
</P>
<P>
	But overall, Kalapa sees the sales as a positive development for  
Hawaii's tourism-driven economy, since the new owners will be able 
to offer rooms at lower rates, making the islands more competitive 
with other destinations. 
</P>
<P>
	That would be welcome news for the tourism industry, which has  
struggled with falling visitor numbers since 1990, and for the 
overall economy, which ranked last in the nation in economic 
performance in 1997, when Hawaii's economy shrank by 0.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Sklarz said the changes in ownership are good news because  
resorts that were owned by banks now will be owned by people with 
hotel experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``The banks had the mindset not to renovate or expand,'' Sklarz  
said. ``It's good to bring in new owners to reposition properties, 
focus management, calm employee fears about closing down and do 
necessary renovations.''

<HEADLINE> Ancient Shipwrecks Found Off Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- Phoenician mariners sailed more than  
2,500 years ago into the uncertain waters of the Mediterranean, 
praying to their storm god for a successful voyage -- only to meet 
death in a fierce tempest. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, American explorer Robert Ballard has located their two  
ships -- the world's oldest known deep-water sea wrecks -- using the 
same techniques he used to find the Titanic. 
</P>
<P>
	The vessels' cargo -- large ceramic containers of wine -- was  
probably headed to the Pharaoh's table in Egypt or to the 
Phoenician colony of Carthage in present-day Tunisia, Ballard told 
a news conference Wednesday, in announcing the discovery. 
</P>
<P>
	The ships' contents indicate they set sail from the Phoenician  
port of Tyre -- now a city in Lebanon -- around 750 B.C. Both vessels 
were transporting hundreds of ceramic jugs, called amphorae, filled 
with wine. 
</P>
<P>
	Remarkably, the amphorae were found intact, stacked snugly in  
rows, unlike the shards typically unearthed on land. Archaeologist 
Lawrence Stager, one of several Harvard University scientists on 
Ballard's team, said the discovery of the pristine jugs ``was one 
of our greatest moments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ships were also almost perfectly preserved -- a result of the  
bitter cold deep-sea waters, where sunlight cannot reach, the 
pressure is intense and sediment scarcely accumulates. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballard said the ocean's deepest waters are capable of  
suspending history in time. ``Human history lost in the high seas 
is waiting to be discovered,'' said Ballard, who was propelled to 
fame by his 1985 discovery of the ocean liner Titanic. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballard, a former Naval officer and oceanographer, uncovered the  
Phoenician vessels about 30 miles off Israel with the aid of an 
underwater robot, deep-water tracking equipment and a global 
positioning satellite. He was led to the area after a team looking 
for the Dakkar, an Israeli submarine that sank 35 years ago, 
photographed what appeared to be the remains of an ancient 
shipwreck. 
</P>
<P>
	The vessels were discovered sitting upright on the ocean floor  
at a depth of about 1,500 feet. The fact that they sank straight to 
the bottom and were located within two miles of each other 
indicated they sank in a storm, Ballard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballard said the deep-sea route used by the two vessels was not  
previously known as one traveled by Phoenicians, and he hopes to 
find more ancient wrecks along the same path. 
</P>
<P>
	One ship is approximately 60 feet long and the other measures 45  
feet. The vessels were probably part of a fleet of cargo ships on 
consignment, Stager said. Stone anchors were found, as well as 
crockery, a wine decanter and incense stands for offering prayers 
to the weather gods. 
</P>
<P>
	Incense offerings were made at the beginning and end of every  
voyage, but Stager said desperate sailors might also have used the 
incense stands during the violent storm that sank the boats. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the pots and crockery found aboard, Stager said he  
believed there were about a half-dozen sailors on each ship and 
that fish stew would have been a typical meal for the crew. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballard said the two vessels were the first intact Phoenician  
ships ever found, and will aid historians and archaeologists, who 
until now had to rely on classical texts and the Bible for an idea 
about Phoenician shipping. Phoenicians were a seafaring people who 
lived along the Levantine coast for about 2,000 years, beginning in 
2300 B.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Stager said the findings were preliminary, noting that the  
expedition ship had just docked Tuesday night. More would be 
revealed in the coming months when the artifacts are brought to 
Harvard for study, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballard's expedition was sponsored by the National Geographic  
Society, the U.S. Office of Naval Research and an Israeli 
archaeological institute. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time explorers have looked for archaeological  
ruins in deep water, partly thanks to newly developed technology. 
Past deep-water expeditions had discovered only modern ruins, such 
as the Titanic. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other ship wrecks found in recent years are older than the  
Phoenician find, dating to around 1300 B.C. and 1200 B.C. But they 
were found in shallower waters and were not in as good condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballard said the answer to many of history's mysteries could be  
found under the sea. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of history books will be rewritten from what we are  
finding in the deep seas,'' Ballard said.

<HEADLINE>  Thompson, McHale in Hall of Fame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- Georgetown and the Boston Celtics --  
for years standards of excellence in basketball -- sent two of their 
finest to the Hall of Fame on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	John Thompson, the combative coach who made the Hoyas a national  
power, entered the hall with Kevin McHale, the long-armed forward 
who helped the Celtics win three titles. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson became the first black coach to win an NCAA title in  
1984. He had been nominated twice before for the Hall of Fame but 
said his political stands might have hurt his chances. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll probably be remembered for all the things that kept me  
out of the Hall of Fame, ironically, more than for the things that 
got me into it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He boycotted two games in protest of NCAA Proposition 42 in  
1989, contending the rule hurt minority students. 
</P>
<P>
	Also entering the Hall of Fame were former NBA center and  
general manager Wayne Embry; Billie Moore, the first women's coach 
to lead two schools to national championships; and the late Fred 
Zollner, the NBA pioneer who owned the Fort Wayne and Detroit 
Pistons. The five will be inducted Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, 6-foot-10, was the Celtics' backup center for Bill  
Russell on the 1965 and 1966 championship teams. He arrived as 
Georgetown's coach in 1972 and inherited a 3-23 program. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coaching happened to me by accident,'' he said Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	With a towel draped over his shoulder and an authoritative grip  
on his team, Georgetown became a college basketball force. 
</P>
<P>
	During the next 27 seasons, his Hoya teams went 596-239. They  
made the NCAA tournament 14 straight times, played in three Final 
Fours, and beat Houston for the national championship in 1984. He 
sent Patrick Ewing, Alonzo Mourning and Dikembe Mutombo to the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson also coached the 1988 U.S. Olympic men's team, winning  
a bronze medal. 
</P>
<P>
	In January he surprisingly retired in midseason for personal  
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	McHale played 13 seasons with the Celtics. The trio of Robert  
Parish, Larry Bird and McHale formed one of the best NBA 
frontcourts, leading the Celtics to championships in 1981, 1984 and 
1986. Boston has won 16 NBA titles, more than any other team. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you get honored for something you have so much fun doing,  
it just doesn't feel right,'' McHale said. ``I never thought of it 
as work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brought to the Celtics in 1980 with Parish, McHale at first  
played as a sixth man. The 6-foot-10 forward displayed a touch and 
moves around the basket that became a modern standard for big men. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very deserving,'' said Bird, who now coaches the Indiana  
Pacers. ``There was never any doubt in my mind he would make it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hall of Famer Julius Erving said McHale worked hard on his moves  
when he joined the NBA and became ``an unstoppable offensive 
player, which opened things up for Bird and Parish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McHale, easygoing off the court, often provided a foil to Bird's  
intensity. 
</P>
<P>
	``His not taking the game seriously helped him maintain a level  
personality and not have as many ups and downs,'' said Jim Dutcher, 
who coached McHale at Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	During his career, he averaged 17.9 points and 7.3 rebounds and  
shot 55 percent. He made seven All-Star teams and three All-NBA 
defensive teams. He is now vice president of basketball operations 
for the Minnesota Timberwolves. 
</P>
<P>
	Embry also has a Celtics link as a member of the 1968 title  
team. He was picked for his overall contributions to the sport. In 
1971, he became general manager of the Milwaukee Bucks as the first 
black in that NBA position. In April, he quit as general manager of 
the Cleveland Cavaliers. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore won her Cal State Fullerton national crown in 1970 and her  
UCLA national title in 1978. She went 436-196 during her 24-season 
coaching career and coached the first U.S. Olympic women's 
basketball team to a silver medal in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	Zollner brought the Pistons to Detroit in 1957. He is credited  
with many innovations, including the 24-second shot clock, wider 
foul lane and six-foul limit. He was one of the league's first 
owners to buy a plane for his team's road games.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton May Be Hubbell Witness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a move that could complicate the first  
lady's political aspirations, prosecutor Kenneth Starr has named 
Hillary Rodham Clinton as a potential witness for the trial of 
former law partner Webster Hubbell, legal sources said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The independent counsel's office submitted Mrs. Clinton's name  
April 21 as one of 63 potential witnesses in the Hubbell case, said 
the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Hubbell's lawyers 
countered with a list of 17 possible defense witnesses May 25. The 
defense filed both lists under seal in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	At a hearing Wednesday, U.S. District Judge James Robertson  
estimated the trial -- scheduled to begin Aug. 9 -- would last five 
weeks at most. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton is pondering a race for the Senate seat from New  
York. 
</P>
<P>
	If Starr calls her to the witness stand, it would be her second  
appearance to testify at the federal courthouse in Washington. Her 
first was before a grand jury in January 1996, amid a furor over 
the discovery of her law firm billing records that revealed the 
work she and Hubbell had done on a fraudulent Arkansas real estate 
development called Castle Grande. 
</P>
<P>
	The billing records turned up in the White House family  
residence under still-unexplained circumstances in early January 
1996, two years after prosecutors subpoenaed them. The fingerprints 
of Mrs. Clinton, Hubbell and former Rose partner Vincent Foster 
were on them. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15-count felony indictment against Hubbell stemming from the  
emergence of the billing records mentions Mrs. Clinton three dozen 
times. Hubbell, a former associate attorney general in the Clinton 
administration, is charged with concealing his and Mrs. Clinton's 
legal work on Castle Grande. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1,050-acre project -- which federal banking regulators  
concluded was riddled with ``insider dealing, fictitious sales and 
land flips'' -- was owned by Hubbell's father-in-law, Seth Ward, and 
Mrs. Clinton's Whitewater business partner, Jim McDougal. Federal 
regulators concluded that Castle Grande transactions cost 
McDougal's savings and loan nearly $4 million, contributing to the 
institution's failure. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton ``will be like most of the witnesses prosecutors  
have to call in public corruption cases, trying to prove their case 
with testimony from colleagues and confidants and friends who 
aren't happy to be government witnesses,'' said former Iran-Contra 
prosecutor John Barrett, who now teaches at St. John's University. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr spokeswoman Elizabeth Ray declined to comment. Clinton  
lawyer David Kendall wasn't immediately available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless there's a smoking gun in her testimony, I don't think  
it's going to have much impact at all'' on a Senate race, said 
Democratic strategist Gary Nordlinger. 
</P>
<P>
	Any testimony she gives at Hubbell's trial ``won't be televised  
so she won't have that video image in people's minds; it's far 
enough ahead of the election; and both Clintons are the most 
investigated people in the world. The American public has already 
formed an opinion on Bill and Hillary,'' said Nordlinger. 
</P>
<P>
	The billing records revealed that Mrs. Clinton drafted a real  
estate option that pegged the price of a 22-acre slice of Castle 
Grande at $400,000. The government, which ended up owning the 
property when the S&AMP;L collapsed, got $38,000 for the parcel. 
</P>
<P>
	The inspector general at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.  
concluded that McDougal's S&AMP;L used the option prepared by Mrs. 
Clinton to deceive federal bank examiners about the payment of 
hundreds of thousands of dollars in real estate commissions to 
Ward. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton told federal regulators 55 times in a 1996  
interview that she didn't recall various aspects of the work she 
and her law firm did on Castle Grande -- including authorizing the 
destruction of her warehoused law firm files on the project. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, her testimony may be valuable to Starr.  
</P>
<P>
	``Prosecutors may need her to authenticate some of the Rose Law  
Firm records, things she actually authored, and she's the witness 
and they need to put it in evidence,'' said Barrett. ``She knows 
how the firm worked, how Hubbell worked, what his day-to-day 
lawyering was like and she certainly does have some recollection.''

<HEADLINE> Stranded Students To Return to Ga. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- It will be a subdued homecoming for a group  
of students stranded in Europe after their teacher paid for their 
overseas trip with checks that bounced. 
</P>
<P>
	The 28 students and two adult chaperones were expected to return  
today. They flew to Europe last Thursday for what was supposed to 
be a two-week tour of Spain, France and Portugal. But the day after 
the group arrived, its hotel reservations were canceled when checks 
written to the travel agency bounced, Richmond County District 
Attorney Danny Craig said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police suspect Vanessa Velez-Cruz, who teaches Spanish at  
Aquinas High School, a private Roman Catholic school, may have 
stolen more than half of the $80,000 the students gave her to book 
the trip. She was in jail Tuesday for allegedly violating terms of 
her release on bond on an unrelated, decade-old theft charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said no charges have been filed in connection with the  
trip because the investigation isn't finished. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without a doubt she did something wrong,'' said Chief Deputy  
Ronald Strength of the Richmond County Sheriff's Department said. 
``She received monies for the trip and, of course, the monies did 
not go in that direction. Where the monies are we do not know at 
this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	School officials say Ms. Velez-Cruz, 47, organized the trip  
independently. She flew to Europe with the students but returned to 
Atlanta on Monday. Police had been tipped off to her arrival and 
arrested her at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelia Mabry, who owns the North Augusta, S.C., travel agency  
where Ms. Velez-Cruz made the trip arrangements June 8, said a 
check the teacher wrote for $38,000 cleared the bank, but other 
checks for the rest of the $83,587 trip bounced on the day the 
students left. 
</P>
<P>
	The travel agency used $3,000 of its own money to enable the  
students to stay at their Paris hotel for one night, and the 
students' parents chipped in $600 each for a few extra nights, Ms. 
Mabry said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1989, Ms. Velez-Cruz was charged with theft when the Augusta  
Shopper Magazine accused her of embezzling $24,000. She was 
employed as a bookkeeper and accountant at the magazine at the 
time, Craig said. 
</P>
<P>
	She failed to appear for an arraignment and eluded authorities  
for nearly a decade until she was arrested in December. She was 
released on bond, which authorities say she violated by her role in 
the European trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Aquinas Principal John Albert said the school did not know about  
the 1989 charges when it hired Ms. Velez-Cruz seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``She would not have been hired had we known,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Williamstown: Summer's Hot Theater </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass. (AP) -- Actress Hope Davis lies seductively  
on a shaky, blue-cushioned chaise longue that looks like a 
rummage-sale reject. 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing a red T-shirt, blue jeans, striped socks and,  
incongruously, a sheer veil, she watches Ethan Hawke pace the floor 
in the gymnasium-like basement of St. John's Episcopal Church. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it worked better when I was over there,'' Hawke says  
to director Nicholas Martin, who is encouraging, if noncommittal, 
about the suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin sits on the other side of an elongated card table,  
littered with scraps of paper, scripts, bottled water and empty 
cartons of low-fat yogurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis and Hawke rehearse snippets of what is a sweet-tempered  
seduction scene that culminates with Hawke lifting the veil from 
Davis' wide-eyed face. They do it again. And again. And again. 
Martin smiles and nods. 
</P>
<P>
	Welcome to the glamorous world of theater. The play is ``Camino  
Real,'' a Tennessee Williams dream fantasy that flopped on Broadway 
in 1953 and has rarely been seen since. 
</P>
<P>
	That -- and the fact ``Camino Real'' has a cast of 43 -- hasn't  
deterred the Williamstown Theater Festival from opening its 
mainstage summer season with the play. The production, which also 
stars Blair Brown and Jeffrey Jones, runs June 23-July 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``Camino Real'' is just the beginning. It is one of 10 plays  
being done in the festival's two theaters from June until the end 
of August. This year's adventurous -- and starry -- lineup has 
created a buzz beyond the quiet corner of northwestern 
Massachusetts where the festival is located. In fact, WTF, located 
on the campus of Williams College, is the summer's hottest theater. 
</P>
<P>
	The match that ignited the rush for tickets was Gwyneth Paltrow.  
Long before winning this year's Academy Award for ``Shakespeare in 
Love,'' she was a Williamstown regular, thanks to her mother, 
actress Blythe Danner. Paltrow practically grew up here while her 
mother performed on stage. Paltrow has worked here, too, last 
appearing at the theater in 1995 in ``The Sea Gull.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This summer she is playing Rosalind in Shakespeare's ``As You  
Like It,'' Aug. 4-15. Tickets sold out within a week of the 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides ``Camino Real,'' seats still are available for the other  
main productions -- ``The Taming of the Shrew,'' ``A Raisin in the 
Sun'' and ``The Price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But all tickets for shows in the festival's tiny 99-seat theater  
are gone. They include three world premieres: ``Chaucer in Rome'' 
by John Guare, ``The Waverly Gallery'' by Kenneth Lonergan and 
``Glimmer Brothers'' by Warren Leight, author of ``Side Man,'' the 
1999 Tony winner for best play. 
</P>
<P>
	Paltrow isn't the only big name. In addition to Hawke and Brown,  
Bebe Neuwirth and Roger Rees will battle in ``Shrew.'' And then 
there are appearances by such TV stars as David Schwimmer of 
``Friends,'' Richard Kind of ``Spin City'' and James McDaniel of 
``NYPD Blue. '' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the festival's prime spark is not a well-known actor, but  
rather its lanky, unassuming producer, a man who prefers that title 
to artistic director. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Ritchie was a New York City stage manager, who worked on  
scores of productions, primarily at Broadway's Circle in the 
Square, before coming here as a stage manager. His wife, actress 
Kate Burton, is a Williamstown veteran. They fell in love with the 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't very hard. Williamstown, at the top of the Berkshires  
not far from the Vermont state line, could be Hollywood's idea of 
the perfect New England college town. Green lawns and church 
steeples abound. The theater, located in a graceful red brick 
building fronted by white columns, sits on a tree-lined Main Street 
in the middle of campus. 
</P>
<P>
	``We both made a decision that we would try to make ourselves  
available to come up here every summer,'' says Ritchie, relaxing 
for a moment in the theater's library right off the main lobby. 
``For the work, for the people that were here, and what it meant 
for us as a family -- at the time, we had a young son.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 41-year-old Ritchie was elevated to the top job in 1996. At  
the time, the festival was struggling to regain the glory it 
achieved under founder Nikos Psacharopoulos. 
</P>
<P>
	Until his death in 1989, Nikos -- no one called him  
Psacharopoulos -- was a godlike presence at Williamstown with an 
unerring theatrical sense that brought more than the usual fare to 
his theater. ``We are not summer stock -- we are a festival,'' he 
would say. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a tradition Ritchie upholds, forsaking the easy route of  
presenting last year's Broadway hit or an old, popular musical. 
</P>
<P>
	He modestly deflects much of the talk about success, crediting  
it to luck, the healthy economy and the fact that theater companies 
simply evolve. 
</P>
<P>
	``Theaters go through curves and sometimes they just bubble to  
the top for whatever reason,'' he says. ``In the early 1950s, 
Circle in the Square off-Broadway was the defining theater. Then 
there was Circle Rep in the 1970s, Steppenwolf in Chicago in the 
early 1980s, then Lincoln Center under Gregory Mosher and Bernard 
Gersten in the mid '80s and now Roundabout on Broadway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others are more forthright in their praise of Ritchie's  
contributions to Williamstown. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael is not some monomaniac artistic director who calls  
himself a producer,'' says director Martin, munching french fries 
and sharing sodas with Hawke and Brown at the student union 
cafeteria. ``He is very clear about everybody's roles. He lets the 
artistic people do just that. He wants to produce. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he got this job, he called everyone he knew -- which is an  
extensive bunch of people -- and said, `I have this theater here. Do 
you have any ideas?' and he acted on them,'' says Martin, who has 
directed such off-Broadway hits as ``Full Gallop'' and ``Betty's 
Summer Vacation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``People who read `Camino Real' think it is very strange,'' says  
Hawke, who plays the pivotal Everyman role, Kilroy, in the 
production. ``People who've seen it say, `It is my favorite 
Tennessee Williams play.' 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of plays that you read you think will be so much fun to  
perform and end up being very, very difficult. They don't play 
well. The great thing about Tennessee Williams is that when you say 
it out loud it becomes fun -- obvious and clear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the lures of Williamstown for well-known actors is that  
they don't have to commit for a long periods. On Broadway, 
producers usually want a commitment of at least six months. Here 
actors are employed for three weeks of rehearsals and two of 
performances. It helps that many of the actors and directors have 
worked together before. 
</P>
<P>
	Some see the short preparation time as a blessing.  
</P>
<P>
	``You can't afford to be cautious here. You just have to jump  
in,'' says Brown, who plays Marguerite, the Camille-like character 
in ``Camino Real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The intensity of it is what is fun. You can work on a movie  
and spend 15 minutes a day acting. Here you spend all day doing 
it,'' says Hawke, star of such films as ``Dead Poets Society'' and 
``Reality Bites.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin already had Hawke, Brown and Davis in mind when he went  
to Ritchie with the idea of doing ``Camino Real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paltrow and Ritchie had been talking for four years about plays  
she might do at Williamstown. Among the half-dozen under 
consideration: ``Trelawny of the Wells'' and ``The Philadelphia 
Story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paltrow told him she got a great kick from being exposed to  
Shakespeare in ``Shakespeare in Love'' and being around the movie's 
English actors and their passion for the bard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think she finds a great comfort level here,'' Ritchie says.  
``It is almost like her second home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one does it for the money.  
</P>
<P>
	``I hate to say this, but I've lost more money in a poker game  
than I've made in my weekly paycheck here,'' says Kind, the 
nebbishy press secretary on ABC's ``Spin City,'' who is appearing 
in Tom Stoppard's ``Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a communal activity here,'' says Kind, relaxing in a  
college coffee bar before a late morning golf game. ``A summer camp 
for actors, in the best sense. There is a dignity and a purity to 
the work -- washing your hands from the grime of show business. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a privilege to come up here -- because we get to fail. We  
don't come to fail, but if we do, the consequences are not as 
great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nor are the financial consequences -- which makes it perfect for  
trying out new plays such as ``Glimmer Brothers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There is something great about being away from New York,''  
says playwright Leight. ``Actors aren't running to check their 
answering machines every 10 minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leight's play concerns 65-year-old twins, who, at one time, were  
both jazz musicians. One got out of the business, the other stayed. 
Now they are seeing each other for the first time in 40 years. 
Schwimmer stars as godson of one of the brothers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ritchie has a yearly budget of about $2 million, 60 percent from  
ticket sales or its training program, which has 90 apprentices. 
Contributions make up the rest of the funding. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do here what no one else can do. We have the talent pool on  
every level, from actors, directors and playwrights of high stature 
to those apprentices,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Being a stage manager, in charge of making sure a show was up  
and running for each performance, was an invaluable experience for 
Ritchie. 
</P>
<P>
	He worked on good shows and bad, not much caring if they bombed.  
``I was on the sidelines watching, getting a good idea of what it 
takes to put a play on the stage. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a stage manager, you have to keep track of order while  
chaos is going on around you,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Ritchie says he produces shows only for his Williamstown  
audience, without thinking of whether they will have a life after 
the summer. ``But if we do it well here, someone else is going to 
say, `That should get a wider exposure.' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this season has great potential to be successful,''  
the producer says. With stars like Paltrow, ``It certainly has 
notoriety already. That doesn't hurt. But at the end of the season 
I want it to be notable for what we did, not just who was here.''

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Women's Soccer Is Fast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Nigerian soccer players, men or women, move at  
only one speed. 
</P>
<P>
	Fast. Very fast.  
</P>
<P>
	That's what the U.S. team faces in the Women's World Cup on  
Thursday night, with the winner assured a berth in the 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that the Americans are shaking in their cleats at the  
prospect of facing the African champions, whom they've never met. 
But the U.S. squad knows Nigeria beat China, the co-favorite with 
the United States, in a pretournament scrimmage. And the hosts know 
Nigeria was relentless in a 2-1 victory over North Korea in its 
World Cup opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``They really are an unknown to us,'' U.S. star Mia Hamm said.  
``But for any team to beat China, it's impressive. And for any team 
to be in the World Cup, it means they have high-quality players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players such as ``Marvelous'' Mercy Akide -- she of the green  
hair -- Rita Nwadike and Patience Avre will test the U.S. defense. 
Goalkeeper Ann Chiejine, who wears a neon-orange bandanna and has a 
flair for the dramatic save, will match her quickness against the 
penetrating strikes of Hamm, Cindy Parlow and Tiffeny Milbrett. 
</P>
<P>
	The Super Falcons carry the same philosophy as their male  
counterparts, Nigeria's Super Eagles, who advanced to the second 
round at last year's World Cup with elan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is our nature to play aggressively, to seek the ball at all  
times and to attack the net,'' coach Ismaila Mabo said. ``No matter 
the opponent, we will not be intimidated. Nigeria will play its 
game. Nigeria will play to win. We will take risks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nigeria's dedication to offense impressed U.S. assistant coach  
Lauren Gregg. She left after the Americans' opening victory against 
Denmark in New Jersey and flew to watch Nigeria-North Korea at the 
Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love their commitment to attack,'' she said. ``They remind  
me a little of us in that respect. But they put so many players 
into the attack, they're a little loose in defense. Against a team 
with more offensive organization than North Korea, they could be 
vulnerable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nigeria did not win a World Cup game in its previous two  
appearances. But, just like the men, the team has made huge 
strides, thanks in part to the Cup experience. 
</P>
<P>
	They also have a fervent religious outlook -- they fasted for two  
days before the North Korea game and ``asked God to inspire us to 
victory'' -- and a deep national pride. The Nigerians have developed 
in soccer quicker than just about any nation, and certainly faster 
than any in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	A domestic league has 34 teams and is sponsored by Pepsi-Cola.  
Corporate sponsors are getting interested in the players, and 
several have endorsement deals. While they aren't earning anywhere 
near what Hamm might pull in, many of the Nigerian women can live 
comfortably through soccer. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the women have jobs, too. Chiejine, for instance, owns a  
hair salon and is the team's hairdresser. It was her idea to give 
Akide a green-and-white coiffure to match the national colors. 
Chiejine has white hair and captain Florence Omagbemi sports a 
shocking orange hairdo. 
</P>
<P>
	The win against North Korea boosted the Nigerians' confidence.  
Their spirits always seem to soar. 
</P>
<P>
	What would a victory over the United States do for them?  
</P>
<P>
	``Come ask me after the game,'' Mabo said. ``I will have many  
answers for you.''

<HEADLINE>  Cavs' Embry Elected To Hall of Fame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- A few weeks ago, Wayne Embry looked down the  
list of nominees for the Basketball Hall of Fame and did a double 
take when he got to the second name -- his own. 
</P>
<P>
	``I looked at it and I was surprised,'' Embry said. ``And I  
said, `Wow!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Embry, who in 1971 became the first black general manager in NBA  
history, got another surprise Wednesday when he was elected to the 
Basketball Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	The 62-year-old Embry, the Cleveland Cavaliers' president and  
chief operating officer, was elected for his contributions to 
basketball as an executive. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had to rely on playing ability to get in, I wouldn't be  
here right now,'' Embry joked during a news conference at Gund 
Arena. ``I could set a pick. I'd set a pick and then roll.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Entering the Hall of Fame along with Embry are Kevin McHale, the  
long-armed forward from the Boston Celtics; John Thompson, the 
combative Georgetown coach; Billie Moore, the first women's coach 
to lead two schools to national championships; and the late Fred 
Zollner, the NBA pioneer who owned the Fort Wayne and Detroit 
Pistons. The five will be inducted Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Embry, who has been a Hall of Fame trustee for years, said he  
was overwhelmed when he received the call at home Tuesday night 
from Springfield, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was emotional last night, and I'm emotional today,'' Embry  
said. ``To be elected into a distinct group of those who have 
played the game and coached the game and contributed to the game is 
just overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I looked at the list of nominees, I knew I was in good  
company,'' he said. ``And to be one of the five elected makes me 
feel really honored.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Embry was a five-time All-Star in an 11-year NBA playing career  
with the Cincinnati Royals, Boston Celtics and Milwaukee Bucks. He 
retired after the 1968-69 season, and two years later the Bucks 
made him their GM, the first black general manager in professional 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was all of 32 years old at the time,'' he said. ``I look  
back at that and am proud to say that, yes indeed, I am an 
African-American, but above all I'm a general manager. I never 
turned down a challenge and it was tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While with the Bucks, Embry pulled off one of the biggest trades  
in NBA history, sending Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to the Los Angeles 
Lakers for Elmore Smith, Dave Meyers, Brian Winters and Junior 
Bridgeman. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if it was his most trying time as a GM, Embry turned  
toward Cavs owner Gordon Gund and said laughing, ``No, there have 
been more trying than that. But that was a difficult one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Embry, twice named NBA exective of the year,  
was part of a front-office shakeup that saw Gund fire coach Mike 
Fratello and move Jim Paxson into Embry's GM spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great honor to follow him,'' said Paxson, busy  
interviewing coaching candidates and working out potential picks 
for next week's NBA draft. ``I hope I can do him proud as we go 
forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a day to celebrate and reflect for Embry, who wore the  
1968 NBA championship ring he won with the Celtics. He hasn't been 
able to win one during his 13 years with the Cavs, but said jewelry 
can never replace the relationships he has formed here. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the people that make this so special,'' he said. ``It's  
the letters and phone calls I get from former players thanking me 
for the inspiration I gave them. Working with people. It just 
pleases me to see people do well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Embry hasn't visited the Hall of Fame in years, and the next  
time he's there, part of him will be staying for good. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I go back for meetings, and I go into the hall I have  
this feeling, I don't know how to explain it,'' he said. ``It's 
overwhelming. Because you're standing there with greatness.''

company,'' he said. ``And to be one of the five elected makes me 
feel really honored.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Embry was a five-time All-Star in an 11-year NBA playing career  
with the Cincinnati Royals, Boston Celtics and Milwaukee Bucks. He 
retired after the 1968-69 season, and two years later the Bucks 
made him their GM, the first black general manager in professional 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was all of 32 years old at the time,'' he said. ``I look  
back at that and am proud to say that, yes indeed, I am an 
African-American, but above all I'm a general manager. I never 
turned down a challenge and it was tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While with the Bucks, Embry pulled off one of the biggest trades  
in NBA history, sending Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to the Los Angeles 
Lakers for Elmore Smith, Dave Meyers, Brian Winters and Junior 
Bridgeman. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if it was his most trying time as a GM, Embry turned  
toward Cavs owner Gordon Gund and said laughing, ``No, there have 
been more trying than that. But that was a difficult one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Embry, twice named NBA exective of the year,  
was part of a front-office shakeup that saw Gund fire coach Mike 
Fratello and move Jim Paxson into Embry's GM spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great honor to follow him,'' said Paxson, busy  
interviewing coaching candidates and working out potential picks 
for next week's NBA draft. ``I hope I can do him proud as we go 
forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a day to celebrate and reflect for Embry, who wore the  
1968 NBA championship ring he won with the Celtics. He hasn't been 
able to win one during his 13 years with the Cavs, but said jewelry 
can never replace the relationships he has formed here. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the people that make this so special,'' he said. ``It's  
the letters and phone calls I get from former players thanking me 
for the inspiration I gave them. Working with people. It just 
pleases me to see people do well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Embry hasn't visited the Hall of Fame in years, and the next  
time he's there, part of him will be staying for good. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I go back for meetings, and I go into the hall I have  
this feeling, I don't know how to explain it,'' he said. ``It's 
overwhelming. Because you're standing there with greatness.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise in Midday Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index rose  
moderately Thursday morning on buying of blue chips. The dollar was 
little changed against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 113.61  
points, or 0.65 percent, to 17,700.36 at the end of the morning 
session. On Wednesday, the average fell 190.87 points, or 1.07 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.92 yen in late morning, down from 121.98  
yen late Wednesday in Tokyo but unchanged from its late New York 
level. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the Nikkei's advance, declines outnumbered advances 596  
to 570, while 152 issues were unchanged during the morning session. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors are buying individual shares with news, such as  
Internet stocks, Hitachi and NEC,'' said Hiroichi Nishi, deputy 
general manager at Nikko Securities Co. ``Foreign investors are 
also seen lifting their Japanese equities weighting,'' thus 
supporting the market, Nishi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitachi and NEC shares were sharply higher after the two leading  
semiconductor makers announced late Wednesday that they are 
considering setting up a joint venture company to develop dynamic 
random access memory chips. 
</P>
<P>
	DRAM chips are used as the main memory devices in most  
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 54.77 points  
to close at 10,666.86 on Wednesday, but the technology-rich Nasdaq 
Indexes Composite rose 17.86 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 6.88 points, or 0.49 percent, to 1,416.06. The 
TOPIX fell 16.46 points, or 1.15 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar stayed in a narrow range for a  
lack of fresh market-moving news. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders remain cautious over possible further intervention by  
Japan's central bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Eisuke Sakakibara, Japan's vice finance minister for  
international affairs, reiterated Thursday Japanese finance 
authorities' determination to stem the yen's rapid rise, saying the 
government is keeping a close eye on dollar-yen moves. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan has intervened four times over a two week  
period to halt the yen's upsurge, with the latest action taken 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan fears a strong yen would make its exports more expensive  
abroad and thus potentially hamper the economy's ability to recover 
from recession. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 126.15 yen, up from  
126.06 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell  
to 1.7250 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.7400 percent, 
driving its price up to 100.64 yen from 100.51 yen.

<HEADLINE>  Astros' Dierker Leaves Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Smiling and joking, Larry Dierker put a Houston  
Astros cap on his shaved head and left the hospital Wednesday, 
eight days after brain surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	The 52-year-old manager will convalesce at home and hopes to  
return to work after the All-Star game July 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's pretty much the same old Larry,'' Dierker's wife, Judy,  
said. ``He kept his humor throughout. Even right after the surgery, 
he was telling everyone a story about Dizzy Dean that had everyone 
laughing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker had a seizure and collapsed in the dugout June 13. Two  
days later, he underwent 5 1/2 hours of surgery at Methodist Hospital 
to remove tangled blood vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a wonderful hospital. It's like staying at the Ritz  
Carlton, or being on a cruise ship,'' Dierker said. ``The only 
problem is, you can't get off. I like to get around and it's nice 
to open the curtains and see the sun and say, 'I'm getting out.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker was diagnosed with arteriovenous malformation, a  
condition in which people are born with malformed, sometimes 
tangled, arteries or veins in the brain. Over time, the vessels can 
dilate, pressuring neural tissue or even bursting and bleeding into 
the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the time I woke up and recovered from the sedatives, I  
have felt lucid and I have had my coordination and balance,'' 
Dierker said. ``I was amazed at that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Rob Parrish operated on Dierker and said the location of the  
blood vessels contributed to few complications. Tests after surgery 
showed he no longer had any clustered blood vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't seem to have any memory loss,'' Dierker said. ``I can  
do the crossword puzzles like I always could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker was the third member of the Astros staff to become ill  
this season. First-base coach Jose Cruz left the team May 10 
because of an irregular heartbeat. Hitting coach Tom McCraw left 
six days later for prostate cancer treatment. Cruz has returned to 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Galante is the interim manager in Dierker's absence.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have no problem relinquishing control or power,'' Dierker  
said. ``That's probably a function of my managerial style. I 
believe in letting the players play, make their mistakes and learn 
from that. I feel the same about Mattie and the staff. They are 
very capable.''

<HEADLINE> European Ministers Visit Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- West European foreign and defense  
ministers got a first-hand look today at the gritty realities of 
postwar Kosovo, including a town still gripped by ethnic tension 
and the site of one of the worst alleged atrocities. 
</P>
<P>
	According to locals, several dozen ethnic Albanian men were  
herded into farm buildings near Velika Krusa in southwestern Kosovo 
and shot, then the buildings were set ablaze. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is appalling. I'm deeply distressed and moved by it,''  
British Foreign Minister Robin Cook said while at the farm, where 
forensic experts are examining remains of what are believed to be 
massacre victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``They must have known what was coming, and then they were  
brutally shot through the doors,'' Cook said. ``We hope they were 
all dead because they were then set on fire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also visiting Kosovo today were the foreign ministers of France,  
Italy and Germany, along with the French and German defense 
ministers. 
</P>
<P>
	Later today they were to meet in Pristina, the provincial  
capital, with U.N. special representative Sergio Vieira de Mello 
and NATO's Kosovo commander, British Lt. Gen. Mike Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	Velika Krusa was one of several sites mentioned in the  
international war crimes tribunal's indictment of Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not going to give up on this,'' Cook said. ``We are  
after those who instructed this atrocity and the systematic program 
of atrocities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said today that Russian  
peacekeepers could join NATO forces in Yugoslavia's war-torn Kosovo 
province as early as Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sergeyev said the troops would be ready to deploy in three hours  
once Russia's upper house of parliament approves a peacekeeping 
plan. The body will start considering the plan Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's plan calls for sending 3,600 troops to Kosovo, as  
agreed during talks with U.S. officials last week. The troops would 
serve under Russian command, but would work with NATO commanders in 
the sectors of Kosovo controlled by the United States, France and 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	In the northern city of Kosovska Mitrovica, where French  
peacekeepers have been trying to keep a lid on tensions between 
Serbs and ethnic Albanians, French Defense Minister Alain Richard 
defended the actions of his soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic Albanians there have complained that the French, who have  
historical ties with Serbia, were giving preferential treatment to 
the Serbs at their expense. 
</P>
<P>
	French peacekeepers looked on Tuesday as Serbs menaced some  
people wanting to cross a bridge to a side of town containing the 
main hospital, many ethnic Albanian homes and almost the only open 
food shops. 
</P>
<P>
	The French soldiers were simply trying to permit all Kosovo  
residents ``to live in safety,'' Richard said in defense of the 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in Kosovo, German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer and  
Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping were due to visit Prizren in the 
southeast, where German peacekeepers shot and killed a Serb in a 
confrontation when they arrived nearly two weeks ago. The Germans 
also have been busy disarming rebel ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini and France's Hubert  
Vedrine also were visiting various parts of the province. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, ethnic Albanian refugees were ignoring warnings about  
land mines and flooding back into the province at an alarming rate 
-- 207,000 in the past eight days alone, according to the U.N. High 
Commissioner for Refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a phenomenal rate -- absolutely staggering,'' said  
Rupert Colville, a UNHCR spokesman in Prizren. 
</P>
<P>
	UNHCR spokeswoman Paula Ghedini said in Pristina that supplying  
tents and plastic sheeting for temporary repairs was becoming a 
priority for aid convoys, especially those going to the western 
Kosovo towns of Pec and Djakovica. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations estimates that about 860,000 ethnic Albanians  
fled Kosovo or were expelled by Serb forces after NATO launched a 
78-day bombing campaign March 24 to force Yugoslavia to accept a 
peace plan for the province. 
</P>
<P>
	Refugees began to trickle back from camps in neighboring  
Macedonia, Albania and Montenegro after NATO peacekeepers started 
deploying June 12 and Serb forces began pulling out under the peace 
deal. That quickly turned into a flood, and dozens of civilians 
have died or been injured by land mines or unexploded bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	Though NATO has pledged to protect Serbs, who were only 10  
percent of the prewar population of 2.1 million, tens of thousands 
have fled for fear of reprisals for the brutality visited on 
Kosovo's Albanians by Serb troops and special police. 
</P>
<P>
	Scattered evidence of such reprisals have emerged in recent days  
despite NATO's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Serbs were killed in the southern Kosovo town of Urosevac by  
Albanian separatists, the independent Beta news agency reported 
today. It said only seven Serbs and a Serbian Orthodox priest 
remained in the town, where the prewar Serb population of was about 
30,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoke from two burning houses in the divided city of Pec rose up  
into the mountains Tuesday. Ethnic Albanians watched one Serb house 
burn and asserted that the Serbs had set the fire themselves. The 
residents couldn't be found.

<HEADLINE> Senate Stumbling Through HMO Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional Democrats are stepping up the  
pressure in the House and Senate, trying to force GOP leaders to 
debate new rights for patients in health maintenance organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	In the House, Democrats will begin collecting signatures today  
on a petition to force a vote on the issue. They need 218 
signatures -- a majority of the House. A rally was planned to kick 
off the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, Democrats are promising to block action on any  
other legislative matter until Republicans agree to debate the 
managed care issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you reach an impasse you have only one option: to turn up  
the pressure,'' Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The immediate victim of the stall tactics was the agriculture  
spending bill, which is in limbo while the Senate deals with the 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate voted 53-47 on Tuesday, mostly along party lines, to  
table a Democratic amendment that would have attached the entire 
HMO bill to the spending measure. All 45 Democrats were joined by 
Republican Sens. Peter Fitzgerald of Illinois and Arlen Specter of 
Pennsylvania in voting no. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said they will continue to change their amendment,  
offering it repeatedly and in pieces until Republicans give in. If 
the GOP tries to move onto another issue, they promised to block 
the move. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., the Republican assistant majority  
leader, said he was willing to vote on the issue if Democrats would 
agree to limits on debate. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said he worried that Democrats will pressure some  
Republicans into supporting amendments that will increase the cost 
of health care and, therefore, the number of Americans without any 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Nickles added that he's also worried Democrats will force votes  
``that can be misconstrued for political purposes.'' He would 
rather allow a yes-or-no vote on the entire package with only a 
handful of amendments. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats want to offer at least 20 amendments, forcing  
Republicans to change the bill or take potentially unpopular votes 
against new rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic leaders predict that many Republicans will have  
trouble opposing proposals guaranteeing minimum hospital stays 
after mastectomies, access to clinical trials and the right to see 
doctors outside an insurance company's network. 
</P>
<P>
	A more limited, GOP-backed HMO bill cleared a committee on a  
party-line vote in March, but Democrats complain that it doesn't 
cover enough people or offer enough provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Other hot issues include whether to give patients the right to  
sue insurance companies that deny needed care and whether to 
include about 115 million Americans whose health plans are 
regulated by state government.

<HEADLINE> Gretzky Enters Hockey Hall of Fame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	There was no great wait for Wayne Gretzky.  
</P>
<P>
	Calling it the ``icing on the cake,'' Gretzky made the Hall of  
Fame on Wednesday with the same ease with which he broke offensive 
records, bypassing the standard three-year waiting period for 
inductees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I used to visit the Hall of Fame, but I never thought I'd be a  
part of it,'' said Gretzky, who grew up in Brantford, Ontario, not 
far from Toronto where the Hall is located. ``If you work hard, 
great things can happen. Dreams do come true. I'm living proof of 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky, who retired from hockey two months ago, is the 10th  
player in NHL history to bypass the standard three-year waiting 
process to enter the Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	The other players who didn't have to wait the required three  
years: Dit Clapper (1947), Maurice Richard (1961), Ted Lindsay 
(1966), Red Kelly (1969), Terry Sawchuk (1971), Jean Beliveau 
(1972), Gordie Howe (1972), Bobby Orr (1979) and Mario Lemieux 
(1997). 
</P>
<P>
	``It's overwhelming,'' Gretzky said. ``Just to be part of the  
Hall of Fame is really special. I love the game. Everything I have 
in my life, I owe to hockey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Gretzky as the new inductees are former referee Andy Van  
Hellemond and Ian (Scotty) Morrison in the builder category. All 
will be inducted Nov. 22 in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Modest as usual, Gretzky noted, ``It's a pretty special day for  
all of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky said his selection by the 18-man committee was ``a  
relief. It was nice to get the call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no doubt, though, about ``The Great One.'' When he  
retired this season, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman retired 
Gretzky's No. 99. Then the Hall waived the usual waiting period in 
his case. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1,486 games with teams in Edmonton, Los Angeles, St. Louis  
and New York, Gretzky had 894 goals and 1,963 assists for 2,857 
points -- 1,007 more than runner-up Gordie Howe scored in his Hall 
of Fame career. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky also scored 122 goals in the playoffs and 56 in the old  
World Hockey Association to give him 1,072, one more than Howe. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky, who owns 61 NHL records, was a 10-time scoring champion  
and a nine-time MVP. He also helped the Oilers win four Stanley Cup 
championships. With all his accomplishments, he has been the NHL's 
Michael Jordan -- admired by fans of all teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998-99 season was one of frustration for the 38-year-old  
Gretzky as he struggled through injuries and ``feeling more fatigue 
than I ever felt before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since his retirement, Gretzky said he has had ``peace of mind. I  
miss the game, but I know in my heart I made the right decision.''

<HEADLINE> American B-52s Headed for Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAIRFORD, England (AP) -- The American B-52 bombers stationed in  
Britain during the Kosovo air war started for home Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The first of the 11 giant planes took off from the Royal Air  
Force base here at 1 p.m. (8 a.m. EDT), followed by the others at 
10-minute intervals for the 10-hour flight to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The planes, which have been stationed at the base since  
mid-February, are returning to bases at Minot, N.D., and Barksdale, 
La., following the formal end of the 78-day Kosovo conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	The B-52s will be followed home Thursday by five B-1 bombers,  
which will be returning to their base at Ellsworth, S.D., and five 
KC-135 tanker aircraft, based at Mountain Home, Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the next two weeks, more than 1,000 U.S. Air Force  
personnel based at RAF Fairford, 65 miles west of London, will 
leave for home. 
</P>
<P>
	The B-52s flew more than than 270 combat sorties and dropped at  
least 11,000 bombs since the NATO air strikes in Kosovo began on 
March 24, said Col. Dick Newton, commander of the 2nd Air 
Expeditionary Group. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were there on the first day of the campaign and they were  
delivering their weapons on the last,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Airline Passenger Rights Bill Moves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Senate committee voted today in favor of a  
voluntary passenger rights proposal by the nation's airlines, 
despite one senator's vocal objections and several colleagues' 
stern warnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislation approved by the Senate Commerce Committee would  
require the Transportation Department inspector general to ensure 
airlines comply with the plan they unveiled last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The airlines committed themselves to telling passengers of the  
lowest fares available, providing prompt ticket refunds and 
informing passengers of known flight delays and cancellations. 
</P>
<P>
	Voting against the measure was Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who  
complained it undercut a stronger proposal he made earlier this 
year with Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the committee chairman. Wyden 
also said the measure lacked specifics about how to monitor 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not proposing here that we establish a legal right to a  
fluffy pillow on your airplane flight or a big bag of peanuts,'' 
Wyden said. ``But I do think that people ought to have the right to 
decent, objective information with respect to these services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said the airlines have told him they are committed to  
improving passenger service. But he also said the Transportation 
Department should step up enforcement of existing aviation consumer 
protection laws. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said that of the consumer complaints filed with the  
department in 1998, only 5 percent were ever reviewed and 
consumer-related fines levied against airlines in 1998 came to 
$126,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``The administration has failed in its efforts to look out for  
the consumer,'' McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said he supported a voluntary approach  
instead of legislation, but cautioned airlines that the committee 
would watch the situation closely. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll come back to this if it doesn't happen, and then,  
obviously, we'll have a more far-reaching and, probably, more 
complicated kind of ... response if it doesn't happen,'' Kerry 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Passenger rights legislation gained momentum after the New  
Year's holiday, when Midwest snowstorms stranded thousands of 
travelers. Some complained that carriers held them against their 
will on airplanes, while others said they had difficulty getting 
reliable information about the status of their flight. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation heads to the full Senate. A House bill would  
require airlines to ensure certain passenger rights, but such a 
proposal seems unlikely to pass this year given the Senate 
committee's endorsement of the voluntary plan.

<HEADLINE> Author King Undergoes 3rd Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEWISTON, Maine (AP) -- Author Stephen King underwent a third  
operation today for multiple injuries suffered when he was struck 
by a van last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	King's mood remained upbeat before he went into the operating  
room, said Charles Gill, a spokesman at Central Maine Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors hope to repair King's right hip socket with today's  
surgery, Gill said. The previous operations were carried out to 
stabilize his broken leg bones and insert pins and plates. 
</P>
<P>
	Gill didn't know how many more operations will be needed to  
bring the 51-year-old ``Master of Horror'' back to full health. 
Doctors have said rehabilitation could go on for months. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides multiple fractures of his right leg, King suffered a  
collapsed lung, two broken ribs and a scalp laceration. 
</P>
<P>
	King is still getting plenty of calls and e-mails from  
well-wishers since Saturday's accident, which happened while he 
walked along a rural road near his summer home in Lovell, Gill 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver who hit King, Bryan Smith, said he lost control after  
being distracted by his dog, which was loose inside the minivan. 
Smith was not speeding and was not charged with any violations, 
authorities said.

<HEADLINE> Illness Pay for Ex-Scottish Miners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) -- The British government said today it  
has hammered out a compensation program for more than 5,000 former 
Scottish coal miners suffering from lung diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	Individual payments are expected to range from $3,200 to  
$80,000, depending on medical condition and whether the miners 
smoked. Total payments to Scottish miners could reach $160 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The compensation program for former British Coal employees in  
Scotland was based on a similar agreement with miners in England 
and Wales. 
</P>
<P>
	In the largest industrial compensation case in British history,  
the government agreed in March to pay as much as $3.3 billion to 
former miners in England, Scotland and Wales who contracted chronic 
bronchitis and emphysema from breathing coal dust. 
</P>
<P>
	The miners had taken action against the government and the  
nationalized coal industry eight years ago, and won the case in 
court in 1997.

<HEADLINE> McHale in Basketball Hall of Fame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- For much of Kevin McHale's life, basketball  
has been a 9-to-5 job. 
</P>
<P>
	When McHale was growing up in Hibbing, Minn., the game paled in  
comparison to his father's toil at an Iron Range mine. Those who 
knew the lanky and sometimes devilish McHale as a kid and in 
college say his ability to keep basketball in perspective is what 
made him so good -- and put him in the class elected Wednesday to 
the Basketball Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you get honored for something you have so much fun doing,  
it just doesn't feel right. I never thought of it as work,'' McHale 
said during a news conference. He spent the day playing golf and 
didn't meet the media until hours after the class was announced. 
</P>
<P>
	McHale credited his teammates at the University of Minnesota and  
with the Boston Celtics for his election. Without strong teams, he 
never would have been elected, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had played for Team Y out there that had never won a  
championship, I wouldn't be standing before you right now,'' McHale 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He always had the right attitude. He worked hard at the  
game,'' Jim Dutcher, McHale's coach at Minnesota, said. ``He also 
didn't treat basketball as a life-or-death proposition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Celtics forward of 13 seasons, who played for three  
NBA champions, will be inducted Oct. 1 to the Hall in Springfield, 
Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Milan Knezovich, who coached McHale for two years at Hibbing,  
said he knew the 6-foot-4 kid with the sweet shot was something 
special. McHale would grow to 6-10 and the shot would only get 
better. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those long arms,'' Knezovich recalled fondly. ``They stretch  
from St. Louis County to Aitkin County.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't just McHale's ability that impressed Knezovich. It was  
how he approached it. 
</P>
<P>
	McHale had a carefree attitude. Knezovich remembers McHale as a  
prankster, ``playing tricks on everybody and anybody.'' McHale 
would sometimes put his teammates up to telling coaches that their 
star player had a bum knee or some other injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he was on the floor he was serious. He loved to play the  
game,'' Knezovich said. ``Off the floor he was just another kid. He 
loved being in the woods. He wanted to fish and wanted to hunt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Addington recognized the same thing. Addington, now the  
athletic director for Rochester public schools, inherited the 
chance to coach McHale when Knezovich stepped down. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a great athlete and I was privileged to be able to  
coach him, but my fondest memories of him are off the court -- just 
the great person he is,'' Addington said. ``He's always been that 
way, a considerate person, a loyal person to his friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The loyalty showed when McHale came on as Minnesota Timberwolves  
vice president of operations. One of his first acts was to make 
Flip Saunders the team's coach. Saunders was the guide when McHale 
visited Minnesota on a recruiting visit.

<HEADLINE> Iowa State Basketball Guard Held </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMES, Iowa (AP) -- Iowa State guard Travis Spivey was arrested  
Wednesday and charged with third-degree sexual abuse after two 
teen-age girls said he raped them. 
</P>
<P>
	Spivey transferred to Iowa State from Georgia Tech and had to  
sit out last season because of NCAA rules. 
</P>
<P>
	He was suspended from the basketball team in December but was  
reinstated within a few days, and assault and public intoxication 
charges against him were dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	Spivey was suspended again on Wednesday. Coach Larry Eustachy  
said that if Spivey is convicted, he will be dropped from the team. 
</P>
<P>
	According to documents filed Monday in Story County District  
Court, Spivey admitted having sex with a 15-year-old runaway girl. 
Police began investigating after that girl and a 17-year-old 
runaway said Spivey raped them. 
</P>
<P>
	In a complaint filed with Ames police on June 15, the girls said  
the incident happened June 12 at Spivey's apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa law prohibits sexual contact between a 15-year-old and  
anyone five years or more older. Spivey is 21. Such contact, even 
if consentual, is felony third-degree sexual abuse, according to 
Iowa law. 
</P>
<P>
	The girls told police Spivey invited them to his duplex. There,  
the girls claimed, both drank alcohol and one said she smoke 
marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	According to court documents, the girls said Spivey took them  
into his bedroom one at a time and raped them. Both had bruises. 
</P>
<P>
	Ames Police officer Nichole Sipes wrote in an affidavit that  
``Spivey did admit to having sex'' with the 15 year old, but said 
he did not have sex with the 17 year old.

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Fall on Profit-Taking / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Continued fear that Japan's central bank is  
determined to intervene to stem the yen's rapid rise nudged the 
dollar higher today. Tokyo share prices fell on profit taking. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.98 yen in late afternoon, up from 121.91  
yen late Tuesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 
121.68 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 190.87 points,  
or 1.07 percent, closing the day's trading at 17,586.75 points. On 
Tuesday, the average posted a rise of 38.77 points, or 0.22 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, an influential Japanese finance ministry  
official hinted that Japan remains determined to rein in any rapid 
rise in the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Eisuke Sakakibara, Vice Finance Minister for International  
Affairs at the Finance Ministry, said Japan is ready to take 
decisive steps in foreign exchange markets if appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am closely watching both the dollar-yen and the euro-yen. If  
we think it is appropriate, we are ready to take decisive measures 
at any time,'' Sakakibara told reporters today. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no signs of intervention by the Bank of Japan today  
in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the Bank of Japan spent about $5 billion buying  
dollars and selling yen to halt the yen's advance. It was the 
fourth action by the bank in 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's recent government data indicate signs of improvement in  
the economy, but the nation is still struggling to overcome its 
worst recession since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank's repeated interventions are regarded as a bid  
to ensure the emerging recovery is not damaged by the yen's sudden 
surge. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong yen would make Japanese exports more expensive abroad  
and thus potentially hamper the economy's ability to recover from 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar moved in a range between 121.72 yen and 122.32 yen in  
today's trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 126.06 yen, up from  
125.94 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, investors locked in profits after the  
Nikkei moved up to a 20-month high Monday, when the index finished 
at 17,738.85 points. That had been its highest closing level since 
October 6, 1997, when the Nikkei closed at 17,824.78 points. 
</P>
<P>
	High technology shares, including Sony and Canon, declined  
following the overnight weakness in their counterparts in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said, however, overall market sentiment remained bullish  
on expectations for a pickup in the Japanese economy thanks to a 
series of measures including an increase in public works spending 
by the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 627  
million shares, up from Tuesday's turnover of 612 million shares. 
Declines outnumbered advances 894 to 334, with 94 issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section shed 16.46 points, or 1.15 percent, to 1,409.18. The 
TOPIX rose 6.59 points, or 0.46 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 213 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.7450 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.6850 
percent, driving its price down to 100.47 yen from 100.99 yen.

<HEADLINE> Injured Knee Puts Javy Lopez on DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Javy Lopez knows many Atlanta Braves fans think a  
stocky catcher has no business stealing second base with a 7-3 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
	But the two-time All-Star believes baseball should be played  
hard all the time, even though his seventh-inning slide Sunday in 
Arizona ended in a trip to the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the way I look at it,'' said Lopez, who sprained his  
right knee after homering twice in the Braves' 10-4 win over Randy 
Johnson. ``If I had to do it again, I might try to slide 
differently, but I'd still try to move up a base.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lopez began 15-days on the DL today. Dr. Joe Chandler, the  
club's orthopedic surgeon, drained fluid and blood from the knee 
Monday, and then recommended Lopez be placed on the DL for only the 
second time in his six-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not disappointing, it's just frustrating,'' Lopez said.  
``This is the time I was hitting the ball the way I want to, not 
only for base hits but for homers too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lopez, who posted career highs last year with 34 homers and 106  
RBIs and had a major-league best .995 fielding percentage, was 
hitting .321 with 37 RBIs when he got injured. No other non-pitcher 
had a batting average over .300 for Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Lopez, who hit .400 with five homers and nine RBIs during a  
seven-game road trip that ended Sunday, also was on the DL because 
of a fractured thumb in July 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie Perez becomes the Braves' starting catcher, and the team  
planned to call up Pascual Matos from Class AAA Richmond today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves got a scare when Perez suffered a cut above his right  
eye during a collision at the plate in the sixth inning of 
Atlanta's 2-1 loss to Montreal Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The game was delayed 10 minutes so Perez could be patched up. He  
got six or seven stitches after the game to close the gash, manager 
Bobby Cox said today. 
</P>
<P>
	If Perez had to leave the game, reliever Justin Speier would  
have been called in to catch, Cox said, adding that the 
right-handed pitcher has done some catching in the minors. 
</P>
<P>
	Matos hit .214 with no homers and 12 RBIs at Richmond. He spent  
May 7-17 with Atlanta, called up when Lopez missed eight games to 
attend his mother's funeral in Puerto Rico, and went hitless in his 
only at-bat.

<HEADLINE> Doctors' Group Votes To Form Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The American Medical Association voted today to  
back the formation of a national union of doctors to give the 
profession more leverage with managed-care companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``My profession is being crushed under the rocks of rules and  
regulations, government influence, HMOs,'' said Dr. Jack L. Summers 
of Akron, Ohio. ``I need help to fight back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vote by the 494-member House of Delegates, the AMA's  
policy-making body, came after almost two hours of impassioned 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
	The national union would support the formation of local  
bargaining units for the minority of doctors who are employees of 
HMOs and other managed-care companies. Federal law bars doctors who 
are not employees from forming unions in the traditional sense. 
</P>
<P>
	Self-employed doctors would not be involved unless Congress  
gives them collective-bargaining rights. Such legislation is now 
pending in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote came on the fourth day of the AMA's annual five-day  
meeting and was taken by a show of hands. The total was not 
released, but AMA leaders called it a clear majority. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers said a labor organization is necessary ``to protect the  
rights of American physicians and to protect their patients.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether doctors could have a union and be professionals was a  
main point of debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not mere laborers. We are not strikers. We are not  
simply providers,'' said Dr. Susan R. Wynn of Fort Worth, Texas, 
who was against the union proposal. ``We're servants. We are 
caregivers who have sworn a duty to society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AMA policy forbids doctors to go on strike.  
</P>
<P>
	Many doctors argued that the AMA should wait for passage of the  
federal measure, which would free independent doctors from 
antitrust laws that prevent from forming unions.

<HEADLINE> Mana: Breaking Global Boundaries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Alex Gonzalez never ``dabbled'' in music. Playing drums wasn't a  
``hobby,'' a ``phase'' or any of those other terms used to describe 
some kind of passing interest. 
</P>
<P>
	From the time he and Fernando ``Fher'' Olvera started the rock  
en Espanol band Mana (ma-NAH) in 1986, huge success has been the 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to be popular, we didn't want to be underground,''  
Gonzalez said in a telephone interview from Los Angeles. ``We 
imagined selling out arenas, our music played all over the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If only everyone could imagine the future with such clarity.  
</P>
<P>
	Mana, based in Guadalajara, Mexico, is one of the biggest names  
in rock en Espanol, a musical movement where artists combine the 
music and language of their Latin cultures with sounds coming out 
of the United States and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Mana has sold millions of records worldwide, including more than  
2 million in the United States. With ``Donde Jugaran los Ninos? 
(Where Will the Children Play?),'' Mana became the first rock en 
Espanol band to sell more than 500,000 copies of an album in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have tremendous recognition. ... Their songs have great  
melodies, great hooks. They're just great songs,'' said Maribel 
Schumacher, vice president of marketing and artist development for 
Warner Music Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	The group's fifth album, ``Suenos Liquidos (Liquid Dreams),''  
won a Grammy in the newly created Latin Rock-Alternative 
Performance category. 
</P>
<P>
	Mana's latest work, ``Mana Unplugged,'' was released June 22.  
The band, which also includes Juan Calleros and Sergio Vallin, will 
be touring the United States this summer, joined by Carlos Santana 
on some dates. 
</P>
<P>
	While Latin musicians like Ricky Martin, Enrique Iglesias and  
Jennifer Lopez are hot, starting out wasn't easy for Mana. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez, who moved to Mexico from Miami when he was 15, grew up  
listening to the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and many '80s bands 
like the Police. Olvera had the same appreciation for that kind of 
music. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to make a kind of rock music that we could fuse to  
different kinds of music from Latin America,'' Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
	But when Mana strayed away from traditional Latin music forms  
and toward rock, they were told by many people in Mexico that there 
was no future in that sound. 
</P>
<P>
	``To say you were rock musicians was almost like signing a  
suicide note,'' Gonzalez said. ``No one thought you could 
survive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mana played wherever there was an opportunity -- restaurants,  
bars, weddings. They didn't have much money, sometimes not having 
enough to buy food. 
</P>
<P>
	But as more Latin American bands began playing rock en Espanol,  
Mana's following grew -- and the record industry began to take 
notice. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Mana is hoping to increase its fan base in America. But, as  
in Mexico, it's difficult to move Spanish radio stations away from 
a set idea of what Latin music should sound like. 
</P>
<P>
	``The programmers of Latin radio stations are old-fashioned. ...  
Radio has been a big setback. Radio stations are afraid of playing 
rock en Espanol, afraid of changing format,'' Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
	He foresees more English-alternative music stations welcoming  
music from Mana and other rock en Espanol bands. 
</P>
<P>
	``My prophecy is that Anglo radio stations are going to start  
playing rock en Espanol, and they're going to be ahead of the Latin 
stations,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Latin stations will have to change to meet the musical  
needs of a growing number of young Latinos who are growing up in 
America with exposure to different styles of music, Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The majority of kids want to hear their idols -- and that's  
rock en Espanol,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> FBI Aids in Kosovo War Crimes Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists and crime scene experts from the  
FBI began work today at the sites of two alleged massacres in 
Kosovo and will turn over their findings to war crimes prosecutors 
pursuing Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, the agency's chief 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The province of Kosovo is now one of the largest crime scenes  
in history,'' FBI Director Louis Freeh said at a press conference 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	A team of 59 agents, chemists, forensic dentists and other  
specialists are working inside a house where prosecutors assert 
that 20 people were herded and shot by Serb troops bent on ridding 
Kosovo of ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI will also excavate another site in the same Kosovo town,  
Djakovica, where prosecutors allege six ethnic Albanian men were 
executed and buried in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The Djakovica house is one of the most notorious alleged  
massacre sites that came to light as refugees streamed out of the 
province and told their stories. Serb troops allegedly rounded up 
women and children, herded them into the house in the early hours 
of April 2 and opened fire. The troops then allegedly burned the 
house and the corpses. 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged slaughter at both sites is described in a lengthy  
war crimes indictment issued last month against Milosevic and four 
top lieutenants in the Serb-led Yugoslav government. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials are accused of killing some ethnic Albanians and  
forcibly evicting others from Kosovo. Names of alleged massacre 
victims in Djakovica and elsewhere are listed in the indictment, 
and the FBI will try to match bodies with those names, Freeh said. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO bombed Yugoslavia for 78 days beginning March 24 in an  
effort to push more than 40,000 Serb troops from Kosovo and stop 
the killing and harassment of the majority Muslim ethnic Albanian 
population. Milosevic agreed to a peace pact earlier this month, 
and the last of his troops left the province last weekend.

<HEADLINE> Rail Service Improvements Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Freight service on the Northeast rail lines  
should begin to improve after three weeks of congestion and other 
setbacks, the head of a shipping group said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Emmett, president of the National Industrial  
Transportation League, said the railroads indicated at a four-hour, 
closed-door meeting that service along the former Conrail routes 
should return to normal by mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody realizes that a lot of the rail customers aren't  
going to see any improvements in the next few days, but that 
doesn't mean the system is not beginning to clear,'' Emmett said. 
``It's like being in a traffic jam. The front car is moving before 
you realize the jam is about to be cleared up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp. have had computer coding  
and other troubles since they carved up Conrail routes in the 
Northeast on June 1. Shippers say the problems appear worse for 
Norfolk Southern. 
</P>
<P>
	Those service disruptions have resulted in late shipments of raw  
materials and difficulties getting the rail cars needed to pick up 
finished goods. Plants have been shut down or scaled back as a 
result, and some shippers have turned to trucks, a more expensive 
option for long-distance hauls. 
</P>
<P>
	The split of Conrail was the most complex transaction in modern  
railroading and followed a problematic merger of Union Pacific with 
Southern Pacific in 1996, a merger that led to severe congestion 
and delays in the West and the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Emmett said the Conrail problems appeared to be computer-related  
rather than a sign of infrastructure failure, as was the case with 
Union Pacific. As a result, he said, the railroads should be able 
to work out the Conrail problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Both railroads have refused to give publicly a target date for  
restoring service. But Donald O'Brien, assistant Norfolk Southern 
vice president for implementation, said he did not think the 
mid-July time frame was ``off the mark.''

<HEADLINE> Colo. Cops Kill Gunman, Find Bodies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CASTLE ROCK, Colo. (AP) -- Police killed a man in a shootout  
early today after he apparently killed his three young children and 
then started shooting up the police station. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Chief Tony Lane said the shootout happened about 3:25  
a.m. when the man drove up to the station in a white pickup, got 
out and started firing into the one-story brick building. The shots 
shattered a window and narrowly missed an officer on duty inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers returned fire, fatally wounding the gunman, Lane said.  
</P>
<P>
	Moments later they discovered the bodies of the three girls,  
ages 7, 8 and 10, inside the cab of the pickup, Lane said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The preliminary indication is that he shot the kids,'' said  
town spokeswoman Susan Casey. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief said the girls' mother, who was estranged from their  
father, had called police hours before the shootout, concerned 
about the girls' safety. She mentioned that her husband had 
suicidal tendencies, Lane said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Casey wouldn't elaborate on the couple's relationship or who  
had custody of the children. 
</P>
<P>
	The pickup was riddled with bullet holes but Ms. Casey said she  
did not know if it had been struck by police gunfire. She was not 
sure how many officers fired weapons or how many shots there were. 
</P>
<P>
	The shots fired into the station awakened two people staying at  
a relative's house across the street. 
</P>
<P>
	``Four shots, real clear, four shots. Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang,''  
said Ellen Walls, 25, of Killeen, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband, Justin Walls, 22, said they looked outside and he  
saw an officer kneel down and order the gunman to drop his weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	``At that point, the guy started shooting, and the officer fired  
at him,'' Walls said. 
</P>
<P>
	Castle Rock is about 25 miles south of Denver.

<HEADLINE> Suspected Serial Killer Profiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The railroad drifter wanted in connection with  
eight killings is a master of disguise, changing names and Social 
Security numbers and using glasses and facial hair to hide his 
identity over the years, investigators say. 
</P>
<P>
	They are puzzled as to what may have driven Rafael  
Resendez-Ramirez from burglary to a multi-state killing spree. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's almost as if he woke up someday and snapped,'' said West  
University police Sgt. Ken Macha, who is investigating one of the 
killings. ``There's no clear progression of violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tattooed ex-convict, who is believed to be 38, is wanted in  
connection with five killings in Texas and at least two more in 
Illinois, and has been tied to a 1997 slaying in Kentucky. 
Investigators believe he is making his way from town to town by 
hopping freight trains. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the slayings took place near railroad tracks, and most of  
the victims were bludgeoned. Fingerprints have tied 
Resendez-Ramirez to at least some of the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators are not sure of the motive for the killings,  
though items were stolen in several of the cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I do know is that if this person is the person we suspect  
in these crimes, it's a very dangerous and violent person,'' said 
Don K. Clark, agent in charge of the FBI's Houston office, where 
the probe has its headquarters. ``I think he can be considered 
Public Enemy No. 1 right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Immigration and Naturalization Service,  
Resendez-Ramirez first came to the attention of authorities when he 
illegally tried to enter the United States from his native Mexico 
in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	He was deported two months later, the first of at least four  
deportations and numerous run-ins with U.S. authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was 16 at the time but has given authorities a  
variety of birthdates over the years and has used false identity 
papers to slip in and out of the country, seemingly at will. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, authorities said they're not even sure Resendez-Ramirez  
is his real name. His description on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted List 
includes 30 aliases. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a master of disguise,'' said Luisa Aquino, an INS  
spokeswoman in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Resendez-Ramirez has been arrested as many as 10 times from  
coast to coast. He has spent time in federal prison and at state 
prisons in Florida and New Mexico. But most of his history involves 
burglary and getting caught trying to illegally obtain or use 
American identification. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI said he is a native of Puebla, Mexico, 5-foot-7 and  
about 150 pounds, with black hair and brown eyes. He has scars on 
his right ring finger, left wrist and forehead, a snake tattoo on 
his left arm and maybe a flower tattoo on his left wrist. Sometimes 
he has worn a mustache, other times he's clean-shaven. Sometimes he 
wears glasses; sometimes he doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
	He is believed to be a heavy alcohol and drug user, although his  
criminal past does not appear to indicate that. 
</P>
<P>
	Resendez-Ramirez has described himself as an orphan, but  
investigators speaking on condition of anonymity said he has at 
least one stepsister in New Mexico, others in Mexico and still 
others believed to be in the upper Midwest around the Great Lakes 
and Vermont. Texas Rangers have interviewed some family members but 
have declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	He is suspected in an August 1997 killing in Lexington, Ky.; the  
killing last December of a doctor during a burglary at her home in 
a Houston enclave; the slayings in April of a pastor and his wife 
at their home in Weimar, midway between Houston and San Antonio; 
the June 4 killing of a 73-year-old woman outside Houston; and the 
killing of a Houston woman the following day. On Monday, he was 
charged with the slaying last week of a father and daughter in 
Gorham, Ill.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals Place Dunston, King on DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Shawon Dunston, who finished serving a  
three-game suspension over the weekend, now is out with an injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunston pulled a rib-cage muscle sliding into second in the  
fifth inning of Tuesday's 14-inning victory over the Houston Astros 
and was replaced in center field by Darren Bragg in the sixth. The 
game was his second start since the enforced sitdown for charging 
the mound in Los Angeles in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Tony La Russa said Dunston, 36, who also has been  
battling hamstring problems recently, could be out 6-8 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``He felt something snap,'' La Russa said. ``He said it hurt  
pretty bad. That kind of injury could be scary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dunston is batting .361 with five homers and 24 RBIs in 122  
at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
	Reliever Curtis King, who had an MRI Wednesday, also was placed  
on the disabled list with a sore right shoulder. King pitched in 
two games after being called up June 17. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a lot of pain playing catch yesterday,'' King said.  
``Hopefully there's nothing wrong that a little rest and some 
exercises will get it back to where it should be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King was sidelined with shoulder tendinitis earlier in the  
season at Memphis. Now, he said the pain has moved from the back of 
the shoulder to the front. 
</P>
<P>
	``It been one of those years, I guess,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals activated infielder David Howard, out most of the  
season with hamstring problems, from a rehab assignment at Triple-A 
Memphis, and recalled right-hander Garrett Stephenson from Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard has played in only four games between groin and hamstring  
injuries, going 0-for-5. He batted .263 with two RBIs in eight 
games at Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard won the second base job in spring training before the  
injuries hit and can play several positions, just like Dunston. 
</P>
<P>
	``David has been playing very well down there,'' La Russa said.  
``He kind of fills what Dunston did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another injured Cardinals player, left-hander Lance Painter,  
threw 40 pitches in a simulated game several hours before Wednesday 
night's game against Houston. Painter will make one rehab start at 
Double-A Arkansas and is tentatively scheduled to start for the 
Cardinals July 3 against Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Painter is 0-4 with a 5.55 ERA in 20 games, four of them starts.  
</P>
<P>
	Stephenson was acquired in a trade with Philadelphia last  
November that also brought reliever Ricky Bottalico. He was in 
extended spring training a long time due to foot and shoulder 
injuries and has appeared in only two minor-league games, allowing 
three runs in 11 1-3 innings and going 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephenson had been scheduled to start Wednesday at Memphis.  
</P>
<P>
	Third baseman Fernando Tatis was a late lineup scratch due to a  
family illness and left for the Dominican Republic. La Russa 
thought Tatis would not be gone too long.

<HEADLINE>  Female Commander Set To Lead Shuttle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- NASA's first female space shuttle  
commander, Eileen Collins, welcomes the double challenge of her 
upcoming mission. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides being the first woman to lead a U.S. space flight, she  
has to make sure NASA's $1.5 billion Chandra X-ray telescope is 
delivered safely into orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia is tentatively scheduled to blast off with Collins, and  
Chandra, on July 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to have a challenge like that because it just  
motivates you and makes you want to work harder,'' Collins, 42, an 
Air Force colonel, said during a break in countdown practice 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, when she boards Columbia for the final portion of  
the simulated countdown, Collins will be the first woman to take 
the left front seat of a space shuttle. She has flown twice in 
space before, both times in the right pilot's seat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really think about that on a day-to-day basis,'' she  
said of the overall honor, ``because I really don't need to. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had just tremendous support from everybody everywhere,  
and that really makes a tremendous difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for deploying the oft-delayed Chandra, Collins said: ``We  
have been training, working hard, studying. We want this to be the 
most successful mission it could possibly be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mission originally was scheduled for last summer, but was  
postponed repeatedly because of problems with the telescope. NASA 
has yet to formally clear Chandra for launch because of the Air 
Force's ongoing investigation into the April failure of an 
upper-stage motor on a military satellite; Chandra has a similar 
motor. 
</P>
<P>
	If Columbia takes off July 20 as planned, it will be 30 years to  
the day that man first landed on the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really kind of a neat feeling to know that we're going to  
be part of that history and continuing on with the space program 
the way we are,'' Collins said.

decided Tuesday by the Supreme Court: 
</P>
<P>
	--Sutton vs. United Airlines. Twin sisters Karen Sutton and  
Kimberly Hinton, both regional airline pilots based in Colorado, 
sued after United rejected their job application because they are 
extremely nearsighted. The sisters have 20-200 vision when not

ruled Murphy is not protected by the law. 
</P>
<P>
	--Albertson's vs. Kirkingburg. Hallie Kirkingburg worked for a  
supermarket chain as a truck driver before he was fired for failing 
a Department of Transportation vision test. He is almost blind in 
one eye. A veteran driver, Kirkingburg had an impeccable

<HEADLINE> Drug Manufacturer Settles Claim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The maker of half of the diet-drug cocktail  
fen-phen has settled a wrongful death lawsuit filed by the family 
of a Texas woman who died in 1997 while using it to lose weight. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for pharmaceutical giant American Home Products Corp.  
and relatives of Mary Marisa Smith, who claimed the once-popular 
diet drug killed the 35-year-old, made the announcement in a joint 
statement Tuesday. The amount was not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're glad to have reached a resolution that brings closure to  
this case for all the parties involved,'' the statement read. 
</P>
<P>
	The release also noted that ``previously publicized reports of a  
potential settlement figure have been unfounded.'' It had been 
speculated that a multimillion-dollar settlement could be at hand. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, which had sought unspecified damages, was one of  
nearly 3,200 filed against the Madison, N.J.-based company over 
diet drugs marketed as Pondimin and Redux. A North Texas case, the 
only other to go to trial, ended earlier this year with a 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial, the first involving a death, began June 1 and had  
been expected to finish by month's end. 
</P>
<P>
	The family had claimed AHP's drug division Wyeth-Ayerst  
Laboratories downplayed the possibility that Pondimin -- a brand 
name for fenfluramine, the ``fen'' portion of the combination -- 
could cause primary pulmonary hypertension. PPH is an often-fatal 
lung disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Phentermine, the other half of fen-phen, has not been linked to  
illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	In September 1997, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration pulled  
``fen'' from the market, citing evidence it may have scarred users' 
heart valves irreversibly and sometimes fatally. An estimated 6.6 
million people have used the diet drug combination. 
</P>
<P>
	A nonfatal fen-phen case in Cleburne, the first to reach trial  
in the country, was settled April 8 before American Home Products 
started presenting its case. The settlement reportedly totaled 
$500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has contended it supplied regulators and doctors  
with plenty of information about the possible lung disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith family attorneys have argued that although the products  
warned of pulmonary hypertension, the company downplayed the 
potential problem and duped the FDA into reducing the size of its 
warning. 
</P>

	Analysts had predicted that even if AHP had lost the Smith case,  
the damage would be minimal. This case did not address heart-valve 
damage, the illness cited in most of the lawsuits and which was not

<HEADLINE> Air Traffic Radar Problems Surfacing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An air traffic control problem that created  
flight delays in Minneapolis this week is just the latest in a run 
of problems across the country this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Power outages, faulty computers and software glitches have  
caused at least six serious outages from New York to Seattle since 
January. In some cases, passengers have been stranded overnight at 
airports, as happened to 100 travelers in Minnesota. On another 
occasion, in Philadelphia in May, controllers lost radio 
communication with six planes, leaving one to say, ``Helpless is a 
pretty good description.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government says a $13 billion upgrade of the nation's air  
traffic control system now under way should reduce problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The work includes replacing work stations at en route centers,  
which control airplanes during the cruise portion of their flight. 
The FAA is also replacing radar scopes and upgrading software at 
centers controlling planes within 50 miles of an airport. The 
overhaul will not be completed until 2005 at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new computer systems and work stations will be more  
reliable and easier to maintain and upgrade than the current 
systems,'' said Federal Aviation Administration spokesman William 
Shumann. 
</P>
<P>
	After an outage in Chicago on May 5, the union that maintains  
the FAA's equipment had a bleaker assessment. 
</P>
<P>
	``This outage highlights the fact that the systems are  
deteriorating,'' said Tom Demske, a regional vice president for the 
Professional Airways Systems Specialists. 
</P>
<P>
	In Minneapolis on Tuesday, radar scopes continued to show the  
position of an airplane, but they did not show the normal 
accompanying data, such as an aircraft's flight number and its 
airspeed. 
</P>
<P>
	Controllers responded by cutting the number of flights landing  
at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport from 60 per hour 
to as few as 28. That caused the delay or cancellation of more than 
100 flights. 
</P>
<P>
	Shumann said an investigation is under way, but preliminary  
information indicates there may have been a problem with connectors 
in the radar system as workers moved equipment from a smaller 
control room into a new, larger one. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 17, a faulty computer processor caused the control tower  
at Philadelphia International Airport to lose part of its 
jet-tracking data up to a dozen times. That caused a temporary halt 
to incoming and outgoing flights. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 6, computer problems at the air traffic control center in  
Ronkonkoma, N.Y., on Long Island caused delays at the airports in 
New York, Newark, N.J., and Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	A day earlier, the Philadelphia tower lost radio contact with  
six planes in the middle of the night after a human error during a 
test of a new generator. A backup didn't turn on as planned. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on May 5, United Airlines had to cancel 25 percent of its  
afternoon flights out of Chicago's O'Hare International Airport 
after software the FAA had installed at its regional air traffic 
control center in Elgin, Ill., started to display only partial 
data. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency had to revert to older software that was reliable but  
not certified to handle the Year 2000 computer glitch. 
</P>
<P>
	The year started on an ominous note, when a power outage at the  
FAA's regional center in Auburn, Wash., on Jan. 15 disrupted air 
travel throughout the Pacific Northwest and delayed flights for 
about 8,000 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	Once again, a backup generator did not work as planned.  
</P>
<P>
	Randy Schwitz, executive vice president of the National Air  
Traffic Controllers Association, the union representing 
controllers, said the problems highlight the existing system's 
Achilles heel. 
</P>
<P>
	``The system is real susceptible to outside interference, power  
outages, traffic from other radio frequencies,'' Schwitz said.

<HEADLINE> Denver's Mobley Faces DUI Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CASTLE ROCK, Colo. (AP) -- Denver Broncos linebacker John Mobley  
suffered minor injuries in a traffic accident near his home on 
Wednesday, and faces a charge of driving under the influence, a 
Douglas County Sheriff's Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mobley was treated at Swedish Hospital for a cut on his head  
after his car overturned. 
</P>
<P>
	Sgt. Attila Denes of the sheriff's office said a preliminary  
investigation ``indicates he was traveling at least 50 miles per 
hour over the posted 35 mile an hour speed limit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There was also a strong odor of alcohol on Mr. Mobley's  
breath,'' Denes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mobley underwent a blood-alcohol test at the hospital, according  
to Swedish Hospital spokeswoman Sara Spaulding. 
</P>
<P>
	Denes said Mobley faced charges of DUI, driving with a suspended  
license, reckless driving and speeding. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 1997, he (Mobley) was cited for speeding on the same road.  
He pleaded guilty and paid a fine,'' Denes said.

<HEADLINE> Gil Morgan Ready To Defend Title  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- It's not like Gil Morgan is playing bad  
golf. Not with a scoring average of 70.43 through 13 Senior PGA 
tour events. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not bad, but not good, either,'' Morgan said Wednesday before  
the final practice for the Senior Players Championship. ``I'm not 
playing like a defending champion, that's for sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And not minding too much, either.  
</P>
<P>
	Oh, the competitive juices still flow. He averaged 69.46 strokes  
per round last year, but a sore back slowed Morgan down a little 
earlier this season. And he spent a considerable part of the spring 
watching his two daughters play some pretty serious high school 
tennis back home in Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll tell you, being a spectator is a whole lot harder than  
being a player,'' Morgan said. ``Now, I know how the family must 
feel watching me play golf, sometimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, Morgan tore through this tournament -- considered one  
of the Senior circuit's majors -- as he tore through everything else 
in sight. He beat Hale Irwin by three strokes over the TPC of 
Michigan course for his fourth victory of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Before 1998 was over, Morgan would chalk up six victories and  
eclipse $2 million in earnings for the second straight season. 
</P>
<P>
	But that was then.  
</P>
<P>
	Morgan is winless coming into this tournament. He won the Senior  
Slam, an unofficial event, in March, but Morgan's best showing in 
an event that counted has been three third-place finishes. 
</P>
<P>
	Replacing Morgan and Irwin as top guns are newcomers Bruce  
Fleisher and Allen Doyle. Between them, they have seven wins -- and 
it's not even July. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleisher became the first player in Senior PGA tour history to  
win his first two events. He finished second the next two weeks. In 
his first 12 rounds, his highest score was 70. 
</P>
<P>
	He now has won four times.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm out here for the money,'' Fleisher said. ``And times are  
changing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fleisher, 50, is a rookie on the Senior tour, and he's the  
hottest player on the circuit with $1.1 million in earnings 
already. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleisher won the 1968 U.S. Amateur, but won only once on the  
regular PGA Tour. He says he might have been intimidated by the 
likes of Jack Nicklaus and Lee Trevino in their primes. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they get old enough, you figure eventually you can beat  
them,'' Fleisher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doyle, who celebrates his 51st birthday Saturday, has won three  
times this season and finished second once. One of his wins was the 
PGA Seniors' Championship -- also a major. He is second, behind 
Fleisher, on the money list at just over $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Doyle is a driving-range operator in LaGrange, Ga. where a good  
year might bring him $30,000. He is back there, doing the books and 
answering the phone after most big weekends on the Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is sort of hard to believe, you know it?'' Doyle said.  
``I'd like to be in the top five when this season is over. But it's 
already been fantastic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, the player who is certain to draw the biggest  
galleries is the man who designed this 6,966-yard course. That 
would be Jack Nicklaus. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus, who had hip-replacement surgery in January, was  
granted an exemption into the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	The 59-year-old Nicklaus returned to competition in May, four  
months after surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks later, he made the cut at his Memorial Tournament in  
Muirfield Village Golf Club in Dublin, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 *Divots*: Fleisher aced No. 15 in Wednesday's pro-am event. He used 
a 6-iron on the 192-yard hole. ... Irwin, who withdrew from the 
U.S. Open last week at Pinehurst No. 2 because of a sore shoulder, 
said he feels ready to play this week. Irwin said he iced the 
shoulder and rested it over the weekend. ... Dale Jarrett, a star 
on the NASCAR Winston Cup circuit, gave a driving lesson to TV 
announcer Gary McCord and received a golf lesson in return on 
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Europe Told To Coordinate Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Air traffic delays in Europe have reached crisis  
levels requiring that governments get together to create a 
borderless European sky, the world body for air carriers said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``European states run their fragmented air traffic control  
services as if they were part of some tiny medieval fiefdom,'' said 
Pierre Jeanniot, director-general of the International Air Traffic 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	IATA said Europe faces a severe lack of air-traffic control  
capacity. The situation is especially bad in Switzerland and parts 
of France and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The number of delays has reached crisis levels,'' it said.  
</P>
<P>
	Although some 30 percent of the problem has been caused by the  
Kosovo crisis, the main problem is the underlying lack of effective 
capacity planning, IATA said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``That means that a 562 mph airplane has less freedom of  
movement than a local train. The European system is both too 
expensive and desperately short of the required capacity,'' it 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	IATA says the 37 states in the European Civil Aviation  
Conference have to implement a strategy put together by air traffic 
control providers to create its planned ``One Airspace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It also says that the international bodies must be given the  
powers to make rules so that the European airspace is managed 
effectively.

<HEADLINE> Judge Reprimanded in Stalker Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A judge who sentenced a stalker to take  
his victim to dinner has been reprimanded. 
</P>
<P>
	The Utah Judicial Conduct Commission issued a public reprimand  
Tuesday of Midvale City Justice Judge Dee W. Alldredge, who claimed 
the victim herself suggested stalker Michael Penrose take her out 
to dinner at a steak house. 
</P>
<P>
	Anita Ferroni disputed that in a telephone interview.  
</P>
<P>
	She said she did not speak at the 1997 sentencing except to  
offer a stunned suggestion of a restaurant when the judge asked 
where she wanted Penrose to take her to dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was kind of in shock,'' Ferroni said. ``He's a judge. I  
thought, 'This is weird.''' 
</P>
<P>
	After the sentencing, Ferroni said she told Penrose she didn't  
want to go to dinner with him. Ferroni said she finally agreed to 
dinner, but left after the food arrived because Penrose was 
verbally abusive. 
</P>
<P>
	Alldredge did not return a telephone call seeking comment on  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission said Alldredge broke judicial canon by ordering  
Penrose to break a court protective order, and brought the office 
of judge into disrepute by acting improperly. 
</P>
<P>
	A reprimand is the least serious of the public punishments a  
judge can face and is essentially a public scolding.

<HEADLINE> Elie Brings His Game to MSG </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mario Elie came with more than a New York  
background and attitude this time. 
</P>
<P>
	He came with New York game.  
</P>
<P>
	Elie, who grew up five minutes from Madison Square Garden,  
recovered from a terrible Game 3 with the kind of performance the 
San Antonio Spurs needed from him Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	He scored 18 points on 6-of-9 shooting, helping the Spurs beat  
the New York Knicks 96-89 to take a 3-1 lead in the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Toughness, man. That's what New York City ball's all about,''  
Elie said. ``Going to the basket hard, finishing the play, dunking 
on people and talking trash. That's New York City ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Garden was much better to Elie than in Game 3 Monday night,  
when he had only six points on 2-for-6 shooting with five fouls. 
Every time the Knicks made one of their numerous comeback attempts 
in Game 4, Elie was right there to say, ``Not tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said it with a three-point play early in the third quarter  
sparking a 9-0 run that momentarily stunned the Knicks. He said it 
with a 3-pointer five minutes later that provided an 11-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
	And Elie was back again with another three-point play that  
quieted the excitement generated by Latrell Sprewell's fast-break 
dunk. 
</P>
<P>
	And all this after it seemed Elie would face another early exit  
at his favorite arena. He went down with his left knee hitting the 
court awkwardly in the first quarter after Charlie Ward stole the 
ball. It was only bruised, and he came back. 
</P>
<P>
	Did he ever.  
</P>
<P>
	``They let me play tonight,'' Elie said, obviously referring to  
the officials. ``I got two fouls early in Game 3, which took me out 
of my game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the fourth quarter, when it seemed the team Elie grew up  
watching would never leave the Spurs alone, he went right at them 
with a fast-break dunk of his own that gave San Antonio an 81-73 
lead. It came with a stare down and some lip that would have made 
Elie's pals at the famous West 4th Street playground proud. 
</P>
<P>
	He even had words with Knicks fan Spike Lee, who's made an art  
out of courtside heckling at the Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	``Spike is a very knowledgeable fan,'' Elie said. ``I just go  
over there and mess with him. He's the only guy that doesn't cuss 
back at me. He's the only guy who really talks to me up front, 
everybody else is on me. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's fine. That's the New York crowd.''  
</P>
<P>
	Still, it wasn't enough.  
</P>
<P>
	The Garden and the Knicks didn't give up, cutting San Antonio's  
lead to 81-79 on a jumper by Allan Houston. With the Spurs leading 
86-84 moments later, Elie was there again to corral one of the 
Spurs' 14 offensive rebounds -- on his own miss. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to get a game from our perimeter players,'' Spurs coach  
Gregg Popovich said, also praising Sean Elliott and his 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Of all the guys on the floor for the Spurs who were under 7  
feet, Elie might have been the biggest nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
	It's an important playground skill that also comes in handy in  
the NBA Finals.

	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- Pohjola, Finland's second largest  
insurance company, is combining its property and casualty insurance 
group with Sweden's Skandia Forsakrings AB and Norway's Storebrand 
ASA. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company, unofficially called Newco, will be the largest  
property and casualty insurance group in the Nordic area. 
</P>
<P>
	Pohjola is to own 25 percent, Skandia 42 percent and Storebrand  
33 percent of the new company although each will have equal voting 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company will have its headquarters in Stockholm, Sweden,  
and 5,600 employees, as well as offices in several Nordic cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The structure of the company was selected to attract future  
partners, mainly in the Nordic and Baltic countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The joint premium income in Newco will be about $2.8 billion and  
total assets will amount to $6.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Pohjola reported net premiums of $870 miilion in 1998, while  
Storebrand had $1 billion and Skandia had $860 million.

<HEADLINE> Court Delays Louisana Case Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Something was missing as the Supreme Court  
ended its 1998-99 term today. A Louisiana voting-rights dispute was 
left in limbo, but only until tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
	The court's practice is to decide all cases that were argued  
during a term before leaving the bench for its three-month summer 
recess. Sometimes, but not since 1991, the court forgoes issuing a 
decision and opts instead to order the case reargued. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said today the case from  
Bossier Parish, La., would be dealt with when the court clerk's 
office issues a batch of the court's orders tomorrow. At issue is 
how vigorously the federal government can protect minorities from 
election-system changes that might impede their voting power.

<HEADLINE>  McHale, Thompson Go to Hoop Hall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- Kevin McHale, who won three NBA  
championships with the Boston Celtics, and former Georgetown coach 
John Thompson were elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame today. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining them are Wayne Embry, the Cincinnati Royals center and  
former general manager of the Cleveland Cavaliers; the late Fred 
Zollner, who owned the Fort Wayne Pistons and helped found the NBA; 
and Cal State Fullerton and UCLA women's coach Billie Moore. 
</P>
<P>
	Brought to the Celtics in 1980, McHale played for 12 seasons and  
formed one of basketball's great front lines with Larry Bird and 
Robert Parish. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great honor for a great player,'' Bird said. ``It's  
very deserving, and I'm very happy for him. There was never any 
doubt in my mind he would make it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A 6-foot-10 forward with long arms, McHale set a modern standard  
for big men with his touch and moves around the basket. His team 
won championships in 1981, 1984 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was kind of easygoing, even though he was a competitor,''  
said Red Auerbach, the Celtics' vice chairman and former coach. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1985, McHale set a Celtics record by scoring 56 points  
against Detroit. Bird broke the record nine days later with 60 
against Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	McHale averaged 17.9 points and 7.3 rebounds and shot 55  
percent. He made seven All-Star teams and three All-NBA defensive 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	He played for the University of Minnesota and is now the  
Minnesota Timberwolves' vice president of basketball operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Dutcher, who coached McHale at Minnesota, recalled McHale's  
carefree attitude about basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``His weakness was also his strength,'' Dutcher said today.  
``His not taking the game seriously helped him maintain a level 
personality and not have as many ups and downs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson was the Celtics' backup center for Bill Russell on the  
1965 and 1966 championship teams. He arrived at Georgetown in 1972, 
inheriting a program with a 3-23 record. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coaching happened to me by accident,'' he said today.  
</P>
<P>
	Yet, during the next 27 seasons, he shaped Georgetown into a  
basketball power. His teams went 596-239, making the NCAA 
tournament 14 straight times. The Hoyas played in three Final Fours 
and won the national championship in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson coached the 1988 U.S. Olympic men's team that won a  
bronze medal. Among the players he sent to the NBA were Patrick 
Ewing, Alonzo Mourning and Dikembe Mutombo. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson surprised college basketball in January when he retired  
in midseason for personal reasons. He was previously nominated to 
the hall. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was something that I wanted,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Ariz. Gov. Conviction Overturned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Federal prosecutors who spent a decade and  
millions of taxpayer dollars pursuing Fife Symington on bank fraud 
charges should give up instead of pursuing a second trial, the 
former governor's attorney says. 
</P>
<P>
	The lead prosecutor, however, says that isn't likely.  
</P>
<P>
	A federal appeals court on Tuesday overturned the convictions  
that forced Symington out of office in 1997. He could be tried 
again, but his lawyer, John Dowd, said prosecutors should use 
``common sense'' and reject the chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Enough's enough,'' Dowd said. ``He's lost the governorship.  
You can't do any more to the guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court in San Francisco said a juror who held out for  
acquittal was improperly dismissed by the judge during 
deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
	David Schindler, the trial's lead prosecutor, called the 2-1  
ruling disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
	Schindler said he might ask the full 11-member appeals court to  
hear the case, but added, ``We will certainly be prepared if it 
comes to that to retry the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dowd said he hoped to meet with Schindler and reach some kind of  
settlement, though a plea bargain is out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be no deal,'' Dowd said.  
</P>
<P>
	Symington was convicted on fraud charges stemming from his  
former career as a real estate developer in Phoenix. Prosecutors 
alleged he gave false financial statements to his bankers to get 
$23 million in loans to prop up his collapsing empire in the late 
1980s and early '90s. 
</P>
<P>
	He was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison but remained free on  
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Symington said the falsehoods were mere errors and should have  
been caught by his accountants. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think divine guidance has been at work here,'' Symington  
said. ``I've always felt we were right, but I wasn't sure that was 
enough for reversal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Symington complained today that he's spent more than $4 million  
on his defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's wrong. Somehow the justice process needs to work for  
everyone and shouldn't be an unequal contest because you're the 
governor,'' he told KFYI radio in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	The 53-year-old Republican is taking classes at a culinary  
school and has no interest in his old job. ``Politics is far from 
my mind,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's ruling was based on the dismissal of Mary Jane Cotey  
six days into jury deliberations. Fellow jurors said Cotey, 76, was 
inattentive and confused, didn't seem to understand some of the 
evidence and wouldn't explain her positions. 
</P>
<P>
	After interviewing Ms. Cotey and other jurors, U.S. District  
Judge Roger Strand concluded she was ``either unable or unwilling 
to deliberate with her colleagues'' -- grounds for removal. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Cotey said fellow jurors ``railroaded'' her off the panel  
because they wanted to convict Symington and she wanted to acquit 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court said a judge cannot dismiss a juror if there  
is a reasonable possibility the reason stems from the juror's 
views. Instead, the judge must order more deliberations or declare 
a mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people thought she was a nut,'' Dowd said. ``She's  
not. She's a remarkable elderly woman who stuck to her guns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Cotey said Tuesday she felt vindicated.  
</P>
<P>
	Asked what she would say to Symington if she saw him, she  
replied: ``Hi, guy. High-five.''

<HEADLINE>  McHale, Thompson Go to Hoop Hall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- Kevin McHale, who won three NBA  
championships with the Boston Celtics, and former Georgetown coach 
John Thompson were elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame today. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining them are Wayne Embry, the Cincinnati Royals center and  
former general manager of the Cleveland Cavaliers; the late Fred 
Zollner, who owned the Fort Wayne Pistons and helped found the NBA; 
and Cal State Fullerton and UCLA women's coach Billie Moore. 
</P>
<P>
	Brought to the Celtics in 1980, McHale played for 12 seasons and  
formed one of basketball's great front lines with Larry Bird and 
Robert Parish. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great honor for a great player,'' Bird said. ``It's  
very deserving, and I'm very happy for him. There was never any 
doubt in my mind he would make it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A 6-foot-10 forward with long arms, McHale set a modern standard  
for big men with his touch and moves around the basket. His team 
won championships in 1981, 1984 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was kind of easygoing, even though he was a competitor,''  
said Red Auerbach, the Celtics' vice chairman and former coach. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1985, McHale set a Celtics record by scoring 56 points  
against Detroit. Bird broke the record nine days later with 60 
against Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	McHale averaged 17.9 points and 7.3 rebounds and shot 55  
percent. He made seven All-Star teams and three All-NBA defensive 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	He played for the University of Minnesota and is now the  
Minnesota Timberwolves' vice president of basketball operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Dutcher, who coached McHale at Minnesota, recalled McHale's  
carefree attitude about basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``His weakness was also his strength,'' Dutcher said today.  
``His not taking the game seriously helped him maintain a level 
personality and not have as many ups and downs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson was the Celtics' backup center for Bill Russell on the  
1965 and 1966 championship teams. He arrived at Georgetown in 1972, 
inheriting a program with a 3-23 record. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coaching happened to me by accident,'' he said today.  
</P>
<P>
	Yet, during the next 27 seasons, he shaped Georgetown into a  
basketball power. His teams went 596-239, making the NCAA 
tournament 14 straight times. The Hoyas played in three Final Fours 
and won the national championship in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson coached the 1988 U.S. Olympic men's team that won a  
bronze medal. Among the players he sent to the NBA were Patrick 
Ewing, Alonzo Mourning and Dikembe Mutombo. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson surprised college basketball in January when he retired  
in midseason for personal reasons. He was previously nominated to 
the hall. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was something that I wanted,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Urges Local Control of Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate George  
W. Bush called for greater local control of education today and 
challenged schoolchildren to read as he began a two-day 
fund-raising trip around Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor urged giving states more freedom to set  
curriculum, allowing principals more leeway to discipline students, 
and instituting stricter penalties for juvenile offenders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trust local people to make decisions for their schools,'' said  
Bush, who has 17-year-old twin daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke to about 120 business people at a $1,000-a-plate lunch.  
``We can give America a fresh start after a season of cynicism,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush hoped to raise $700,000 at the Bethlehem event and  
subsequent events in Philadelphia, Harrisburg and Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	During his remarks, he also championed tax cuts for working  
families and increased military spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will rebuild our military power because a dangerous world  
still requires a sharpened sword,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge introduced Bush as ``my good  
friend'' and ``my friend from Texas.'' Bush returned the favor, 
calling Ridge a ``good buddy'' and ``one of the best governors in 
all of America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ridge was expected to accompany Bush during his Pennsylvania  
campaign and host him at the governor's mansion Wednesday night. On 
Thursday, Bush attends a breakfast in Harrisburg and a luncheon in 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	After leaving Bethlehem, Bush and Ridge spoke about the  
importance of education to 40 elementary-aged students in the 
library at the Visitation BVM School in Philadelphia. Just a few 
children raised their hands when Bush asked how many of them read 
more than they watched TV. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you can read, you can learn. And if you learn a lot, you  
can realize your dreams in this country,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	After a student asked him a question in Spanish, Bush rattled an  
answer back without taking a breath. 
</P>
<P>
	``She asked if I could speak Spanish. As she can tell, not very  
well,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Bethlehem, Bush didn't mention either President Clinton or  
Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential front-runner, 
but made veiled jabs at both. ``I will not use my office as a 
mirror to reflect public opinion,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a proposal eerily similar to his father's ``thousand points  
of light,'' Bush championed an ``army of compassion.'' These 
private-sector ``compassion soldiers'' would offer help to unwed 
mothers or job training to welfare recipients with economic 
incentives but no direct aid from the government, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Government cannot put a sense of purpose in our lives. ...  
Government can rally the armies of compassion to make sure no one 
is left behind,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	After Bush's 25-minute speech, supporters compared him to his  
father, former President George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a much better campaigner than his father,'' said  
Bethlehem marketing consultant Bill Maier. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorothy Baker said the trip was a good start, but Bush still has  
a long way to go. 
</P>
<P>
	``It depends on who he gets as his running mate. You've got to  
get somebody strong,'' said Mrs. Baker.

<HEADLINE> Doctors' Group Votes To Form Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The American Medical Association voted today to  
back the formation of a national union of doctors to give the 
profession more leverage with managed-care companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``My profession is being crushed under the rocks of rules and  
regulations, government influence, HMOs,'' said Dr. Jack L. Summers 
of Akron, Ohio. ``I need help to fight back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vote by the 494-member House of Delegates, the AMA's  
policy-making body, came after almost two hours of impassioned 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors who are work full-time for health maintenance  
organizations or hospitals can already unionize, and have been 
doing so at an increasing rate. The AMA vote essentially puts the 
organization's stamp of approval on the movement. 
</P>
<P>
	A national union would support the formation of local bargaining  
units for doctors who are not independent practitioners. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law bars doctors who are not employees from forming  
unions in the traditional sense. Self-employed doctors would not be 
involved unless Congress gives them collective-bargaining rights. 
Such legislation is now pending in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote came on the fourth day of the AMA's annual five-day  
meeting and was taken by a show of hands. The total was not 
released, but AMA leaders called it a clear majority. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers said a labor organization is necessary ``to protect the  
rights of American physicians and to protect their patients.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether doctors could have a union and be professionals was a  
main point of debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not mere laborers. We are not strikers. We are not  
simply providers,'' said Dr. Susan R. Wynn of Fort Worth, Texas, 
who was against the union proposal. ``We're servants. We are 
caregivers who have sworn a duty to society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AMA policy forbids doctors to go on strike.  
</P>
<P>
	Many doctors argued that the AMA should wait for passage of the  
federal measure, which would free independent doctors from 
antitrust laws that prevent from forming unions. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Trade Commission Chairman Robert Pitofsky told the  
Judiciary Committee on Tuesday that such exemptions could lead to 
price-fixing and boycotts by physicians, dentists and pharmacists. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though there are serious problems concerning the  
relationship of HMOs and other health plans to doctors and patients 
that deserve to be addressed, this proposal is the wrong 
approach,'' Pitofsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, an estimated 38,000 to 45,000 doctors belong to  
unions, up from only about 25,000 two years ago, and experts 
predict the numbers will continue to grow. Those numbers are 
roughly 6 percent of the nation's 600,000 practicing doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are now 25 states with private labor unions for  
physicians, and if the AMA does not involve itself now, with those 
that exist and those that will exist, ... then the AMA will lose 
its credibility,'' Dr. Michael Connair, an orthopedic surgeon in 
New Haven, Conn., said earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Many unionized doctors are interns and residents. All work  
full-time for hospitals or health maintenance organizations. Their 
contracts cover wages and working conditions, much like other 
workers' contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	About half of the nation's doctors now work in these type of  
salaried positions, with 80 percent of recent graduates taking such 
jobs.

	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's NEC Corp. and Hitachi Ltd. have agreed to  
cooperate on developing dynamic random access memory chips, the 
main memory devices in most computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The electronics companies are considering forming a joint  
venture that would cover brand development and design, and unify 
NEC and Hitachi DRAM products under a single brand, according to a 
statement released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The joint venture would be established at the end of 1999, the  
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies said a venture would provide ``significant  
improvements in profitability for the semiconductor businesses at 
both companies, thanks to economies of scale and shared expenses.''

<HEADLINE> Gore On California Fund-Raising Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Al Gore made a final dash Wednesday for donor  
dollars in California before a month's end deadline to report 
fund-raising totals, hoping a hefty campaign treasury will show his 
strength as a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic vice president picked up $125,000 at his first  
stop in the San Diego community of La Jolla, deep in Republican 
territory, and hoped to raise a total of $1.1 million from 
five-fund-raisers in California this week. 
</P>
<P>
	He also was to attend a fund-raiser Friday in Detroit after  
picking up $400,000 Tuesday at a similar event in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	June 30 marks the deadline for presidential candidates to report  
contributions over a three-month period to the Federal Election 
Commission. These results can show the relative strengths and 
weaknesses of each candidates in terms of fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore wants to emerge with as much money in his campaign treasury  
as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	In California, Gore was meeting with ``core supporters, many of  
whom have been backing him for many years,'' said his spokesman 
Chris Lehane. 
</P>
<P>
	He used the events and a speech Wednesday night in San Francisco  
to again attack the Republican front-runner, Texas Gov. George 
Bush, on gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of shielding gun manufacturers against being held  
responsible for their activities, we should be shielding children 
and families against violence,'' he said. ``We have to make sure 
that the agenda for America's future is set by the American people 
and not by organizations like the National Rifle Association.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush last Friday signed legislation prohibiting cities in Texas  
from suing firearm or ammunition makers or sellers for damages 
resulting from the criminal misuse of firearms manufactured and 
sold legally to the public. The House that same day rejected new 
curbs that the Clinton administration wanted on gun sales. 
</P>
<P>
	In La Jolla, Gore told about 125 supporters, each of whom paid  
$1,000, that the wave of young people moving through school is 
making educational improvements even more urgent. 
</P>
<P>
	``All across this nation schools are falling down with holes in  
the roofs and cracks in the walls and overburdened teachers,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said World War II veterans emphasized improving the public  
schools they returned to find. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we have a bigger generation of schoolchildren at a time  
when the learning is even more important than ever before,'' he 
said. ``And so the question falls to us: Are we ready to exercise 
our responsibility and do the right thing by these kids the way the 
World War II veterans did after World War II? I think the answer 
must be yes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore repeated his promise to seek ``high-quality preschools,''  
improve teacher training, reduce class size, and wire classrooms to 
the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The swing that brought Gore to California was his second to the  
state in less than a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's trip to the state, his 57th as vice president, came one  
week before the first visit to California by Bush since the 
Republican government of Texas announced he would seek the GOP 
nomination for president.

<HEADLINE> Superheroes Come in All Colors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Black Lightning came and went.  
</P>
<P>
	``Pow!''  
</P>
<P>
	So did the Falcon and Power Man.  
</P>
<P>
	``Blam!'' ``Wham!''  
</P>
<P>
	All three were black superheroes created by major white comic  
book publishers; all have debuted and have all but disappeared 
since 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the year Donald McQuay graduated from high school -- a  
hopeful young artist who, like many others, eventually gave up his 
craft to take jobs that could support a family. So why in the world 
is McQuay -- now pushing 50 -- in a basement studio in his South Side 
home, drawing black, Asian and other comic book characters? 
</P>
<P>
	``It may seem a little crazy. Here I am on the back end of my  
life trying to do this,'' McQuay says, sitting amid a clutter of 
drafting tables, drawings and, just a few feet away, his daughters' 
toy oven and dishes. ``But it's my dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That dream, so far, has led to a handful of comic books,  
self-published with the help of a North Dakota printer and 
distributed at comic book conventions and stores, mostly in the 
Chicago area. 
</P>
<P>
	But even with work published, McQuay, who is black, isn't about  
to quit his day job -- nor are many other artists like him. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're lucky if you can break even,'' says Turtel Onli, a  
47-year-old artist and teacher who also is black and lives in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Black comic strip artists who draw black characters, including  
those who created the syndicated strips ``Curtis'' and ``Herb and 
Jamaal,'' have had a bit more success. And major comic book 
characters also haven't completely given up on their attempts to 
cross cultural boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
	DC Comics' Batman sometimes speaks Spanish -- at least in  
editions distributed in Mexico, Spain and other Latin American 
countries. And at least one black character, known as ``Spawn,'' 
has made it to the big screen. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, though, there have been more failures than successes.  
DC, for example, tried its own series with black superheroes called 
Milestone in the early 1990s but dropped the line when it didn't 
make enough money. 
</P>
<P>
	``The black-only superhero line was a really good try in terms  
of getting the multicultural voice out there,'' said Francine G. 
Burke, manager of international rights for the New York-based 
company. ``But when you go for all women or all black superheroes, 
it's tough in a market that's looking for more than just those 
characters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's also difficult to come up with new characters to compete  
with the long-standing popularity of Batman, Superman, Spider-Man 
and Wonder Woman, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some who are trying to break into the field attribute the  
failure of black and other minority characters in part to the 
relatively small number of nonwhite artists and writers who have 
made it big -- an issue Burke says major comic book publishers are 
trying to address. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to see our faces in the books, but behind our faces  
are not us. They're basically an interpretation of us,'' says 
Edward Sims, a black comic book writer who sometimes works with 
McQuay. 
</P>
<P>
	Onli places at least some of the blame closer to home.  
</P>
<P>
	He published his first black superhero comic book, called ``Nog  
-- The Protector of the Pyramids,'' in 1981, but says it was 
difficult to get even black-owned bookstores to carry them. He also 
organizes a convention for black comic-book artists, but attendance 
has been down in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the black community, music means more than images,'' Onli  
says. ``Sing and everybody loves you; draw good ... and big deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, McQuay's ``Circle Unleashed'' series tells of a  
band of tough, do-gooding superheroes, including the Dark Prophet -- 
a sort of half-black, half-alien character -- and another simply 
known as John, a former Georgia slave who is given special powers 
by aliens. His ``Tsunami'' series features an Asian character. 
</P>
<P>
	A dock supervisor at the University of Illinois-Chicago, McQuay  
does most of his drawing long after his 5-year-old twins, D'Yona 
and Dawn, are tucked in bed. He has financed the books with small 
loans from nonprofit organizations that help fledgling artists and 
business owners. 
</P>
<P>
	McQuay wonders if it may simply be a matter of getting people --  
even minorities -- used to seeing nonwhite superheroes. 
</P>
<P>
	He recalls his own first big art show, a big day for a sophomore  
in high school who grew up in Chicago's tough Stateway Gardens 
housing projects, sometimes drawing on the back of sale posters 
instead of standard paper. 
</P>
<P>
	McQuay was taken aback when one admirer asked, ``Do you draw  
black people?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, 'Wow.' I didn't realize until that moment that I had  
no black characters -- not one,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	That soon changed with ``Kane and Abell,'' a series with black  
characters based on the Kennedy assassination,'' and a comic strip 
depicting the passage of Harriet Tubman and other slaves along the 
Underground Railroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of that work hangs on his basement studio's walls -- a proud  
but somewhat bittersweet reminder of his early days as an artist. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish there'd been somebody to really take me aside and show  
me how it all worked,'' McQuay says. ``Who knows what I could've 
become?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then his eyes light up.  
</P>
<P>
	``But maybe,'' he says, ``Maybe one day, I'll get that big  
hit.''

<HEADLINE> Gov't Challenges Microsoft Witness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After two days of hearing Microsoft's final  
courtroom witness criticize the government's antitrust case as 
without adequate proof or merit, the government is getting to 
challenge those claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyer David Boies today began questioning  
economist Richard Schmalensee, who has argued that competition 
facing the Microsoft Corp. in the booming high-tech industry is so 
intense that no federal intervention is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``The threat of future competition requires Microsoft to  
innovate rapidly, to evangelize, to invest in improvements,'' 
Schmalensee said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmalensee told U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson  
that Microsoft is challenged by a newly resurgent Apple Computer 
Inc. and an upstart software movement surrounding the Linux 
computer operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson was clearly impressed with Schmalensee's depiction of a  
new generation of ``server-based'' software -- programs that will be 
delivered across emerging high-speed Internet connections rather 
than relying on Microsoft's dominant Windows operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can you do that?'' asked Jackson, adding later: ``The concept  
to me sounds very attractive. I can't imagine why ISVs (independent 
software vendors) aren't developing applications in droves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an extraordinary coincidence, Microsoft today introduced a  
story from an Internet news organization that was published Tuesday 
just hours before Jackson made the comment. The headline: 
``Web-based applications debut in droves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes, Your Honor,'' Microsoft lawyer Michael Lacovara  
said, ``we get lucky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Prescient writer,'' the judge joked.  
</P>
<P>
	Schmalensee on Tuesday reminded the judge of testimony last week  
from another Microsoft witness, software executive Gordon Eubanks, 
who said the Internet has become ``the platform of choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the courtroom, Boies said Microsoft was trying to muddy  
the waters by drawing attention away from the dominance of its 
Windows software, which runs most of the world's personal 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market is operating systems,'' Boies said. ``Things that  
compete with operating systems are other operating systems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Microsoft also told Jackson on Tuesday that it faces more  
new competition from the recent $10 billion merger between America 
Online Inc., the world's largest Internet provider, and Netscape 
Communications Corp., the Internet software pioneer. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmalensee cited internal AOL documents revealing plans ``to  
absorb more share of computing time, with the goal of becoming 
users' de facto environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``AOL does not plan to produce an operating system, but it plans  
to be effectively the operating system,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmalensee also described investments by companies that produce  
rival technologies, such as Sun Microsystems Inc., saying those 
expenditures don't match the government's claims that Microsoft is 
an entrenched monopolist that won't be overthrown without a judge's 
intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	``Either Sun is throwing away money, or it has a rather  
different view of the world than plaintiffs,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Sexy Novelas Fuel Univision Ratings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Spanish viewers tune in almost religiously for  
their daily dose of passion and forbidden love in the latest 
``telenovelas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the Univision television network, which airs seven hours of  
the plot-twisting dramas daily, the result has been consistently 
the highest ratings among Spanish-language stations in the United 
States since 1961. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like my therapy,'' said viewer Rita Perez of Miami Beach.  
``It is the only thing that gets me relaxed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The one-hour dramas include plenty of screaming, lies,  
betrayals, murders and marriages. But soap operas they're not, said 
Mario Rodriguez, president of Univision Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the biggest errors people make is calling novelas soap  
operas,'' said Rodriguez. ``Novelas are based on literary books 
that are turned into a television story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The novelas, which are filmed in Mexico and Venezuela, usually  
last no longer than six months; NBC's ``Another World,'' by 
contrast, winds down this week after 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Univision buys 21 new novelas a year. The most popular ones  
focus on romance and comedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Camila,'' a story about a poor, young Mexican woman who falls  
deeply in love with a big-city lawyer, is currently the most 
popular novela on the network, starring Eduardo Capetillo and wife 
Biby Gaytan. Capetillo, also one of Latin America's top pop 
artists, sings the opening theme to the novela. 
</P>
<P>
	``TV operators need to focus on two things to be successful,''  
said Frank L. Bodenchak, a Morgan Stanley Dean Witter broadcast 
analyst who follows Univision. ``It's programming and sales, and 
this company has been extremely impressive in both categories. 
(Among) their fortes have been their novelas.''

<HEADLINE> Most Asian Markets Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets finished mostly lower  
Wednesday, but sentiment remained bullish across the region, with 
Singapore blue chips soaring to a new record and Seoul shares 
climbing to levels unseen in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices were off Wednesday on the bigger Tokyo and Hong Kong  
exchanges, but analysts said they appeared to be taking only a 
breather after recent rallies pushes shares to 20-month highs on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 190.87  
points, or 1.07 percent, to 17,586.75. On Tuesday, the average had 
risen 38.77 points to highs not seen since October 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Wednesday's drop, traders were holding high expectations  
of a pickup in the Japanese economy after the recent release of 
robust gross domestic product data, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the U.S. dollar rose against the Japanese  
yen after an influential Japanese finance ministry official, Eisuke 
Sakakibara, hinted that Japan remains determined to stem any rapid 
rise in the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.98 yen in late afternoon, up from 121.91  
yen late Tuesday in Tokyo and also above its overnight New York 
level of 121.68 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In Singapore, the upward momentum continued, pushing the  
benchmark share index to a record closing high. 
</P>
<P>
	The Straits Times Index rose 2.1 percent, or 44.24 points, to  
2,167.47, overtaking the previous record close of 2,163.11 points 
reached on Feb. 5, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors are optimistic that a sustained economic recovery is  
underway, following better-than-expected export figures for May, 
dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Seoul, the key index rose for the sixth consecutive day to  
the highest finish in three years on expectations of strong 
corporate earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kospi index rose 12.66 points, or 1.4 percent, to 888.63,  
the highest since it hit 888.66 points on June 11, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, share prices slipped after posting huge gains over  
the past four days, but analysts predicted the upward momentum 
hasn't run out of steam. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue chip Hang Seng Index closed down 28.84 points, or 0.2  
percent, at 13,976.04. The Hang Seng had surged a total of 8.3 
percent over the four previous sessions, climbing around the 
14,000-point mark for the first time since October 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai stock prices fell, led by banking shares after  
credit agency Moody's reported Tuesday that Thai banks remain in 
deep crisis. The SET index was down 4.92 points, or 0.9 percent, to 
540.99 points. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian blue chip stocks fell, but shares in small  
companies rose on lower interest rates. The JSE index lost 1.4 
percent, or 10.013 points, to 700.669. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares rose slightly, despite  
expectations that economic data that are due to be released soon 
would show further contraction in the economy. The Composite Index 
rose 1.40 points, or 0.2 percent, at 794.83 points. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine stocks fell slightly, prompted by Wall  
Street's overnight losses. The PSE index slipped 7.69 points, or 
0.3 percent, to 2,470.92. 
</P>

	SYDNEY: Australian shares fell, dragged down by resource stocks.  
The All Ordinaries index closed down 14.2 points, or 0.5 percent, 
at 2,990.6.

abated. The Weighted Price Index lost 116.59 points, or 1.4 
percent, to 8,492.32. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand shares rose for the second straight day,  
boosted by gains in market heavyweight Telecom New Zealand. The 
benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 8.58 points, or 0.4 percent, 
to 2,104.45.

<HEADLINE> Airliners Make Emergency Landings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCOTTSBLUFF, Neb. (AP) -- A United Airlines 737 jetliner made an  
emergency landing after smoke appeared in the cockpit and 
first-class cabin. 
</P>
<P>
	The 58 passengers and eight airline employees on Flight 281 were  
safely evacuated through emergency exits after the plane landed at 
the Western Nebraska Regional Airport late Tuesday, said United 
spokesman Susana Leyva. 
</P>
<P>
	In Texas, meanwhile, passengers aboard a Trans World Airlines  
plane were prepared for an emergency landing at Dallas-Fort Worth 
International after a cockpit indicator showed the plane's nose 
gear did not deploy. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane, TWA Flight 655 from St. Louis, circled the airport  
for about an hour while crews sprayed flame-retardant foam on a 
runway. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the plane's nose wheels had deployed and the aircraft  
landed safely just before midnight. The cockpit indicator was 
faulty and had given a false reading, TWA spokesman Jim Brown said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	United's Flight 281 was en route from Minneapolis to Denver when  
the crew and passengers noticed smoke. 
</P>
<P>
	It smelled like ``burned popcorn,'' said passenger Thad  
Koppenhafer of Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	``I fried the wires on my Volkswagen once, and it smelled just  
like that,'' said passenger Jim Fallon of Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	The source of the smoke was still not known today, United  
spokesman Kristina Prince said in Chicago. Passengers said the 
plane had just flown through severe weather, with lightning nearby.

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Fall on Profit-Taking / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Continued fear that Japan's central bank is  
determined to intervene to stem the yen's rapid rise nudged the 
dollar higher today. Tokyo share prices fell on profit taking. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.98 yen in late afternoon, up from 121.91  
yen late Tuesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 
121.68 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 190.87 points,  
or 1.07 percent, closing the day's trading at 17,586.75 points. On 
Tuesday, the average posted a rise of 38.77 points, or 0.22 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, an influential Japanese finance ministry  
official hinted that Japan remains determined to rein in any rapid 
rise in the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Eisuke Sakakibara, Vice Finance Minister for International  
Affairs at the Finance Ministry, said Japan is ready to take 
decisive steps in foreign exchange markets if appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am closely watching both the dollar-yen and the euro-yen. If  
we think it is appropriate, we are ready to take decisive measures 
at any time,'' Sakakibara told reporters today. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no signs of intervention by the Bank of Japan today  
in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the Bank of Japan spent about $5 billion buying  
dollars and selling yen to halt the yen's advance. It was the 
fourth action by the bank in 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's recent government data indicate signs of improvement in  
the economy, but the nation is still struggling to overcome its 
worst recession since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank's repeated interventions are regarded as a bid  
to ensure the emerging recovery is not damaged by the yen's sudden 
surge. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong yen would make Japanese exports more expensive abroad  
and thus potentially hamper the economy's ability to recover from 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar moved in a range between 121.72 yen and 122.32 yen in  
today's trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 126.06 yen, up from  
125.94 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, investors locked in profits after the  
Nikkei moved up to a 20-month high Monday, when the index finished 
at 17,738.85 points. That had been its highest closing level since 
October 6, 1997, when the Nikkei closed at 17,824.78 points. 
</P>
<P>
	High technology shares, including Sony and Canon, declined  
following the overnight weakness in their counterparts in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said, however, overall market sentiment remained bullish  
on expectations for a pickup in the Japanese economy thanks to a 
series of measures including an increase in public works spending 
by the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 627  
million shares, up from Tuesday's turnover of 612 million shares. 
Declines outnumbered advances 894 to 334, with 94 issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section shed 16.46 points, or 1.15 percent, to 1,409.18. The 
TOPIX rose 6.59 points, or 0.46 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 213 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.7450 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.6850 
percent, driving its price down to 100.47 yen from 100.99 yen.

<HEADLINE> Major Newspapers Revamp Web Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Don't just get the news and go. Stick around  
awhile. 
</P>
<P>
	That's what newspaper companies are hoping will happen as they  
expand their Internet sites to lure in more people -- and more 
advertising dollars -- with snazzier services like entertainment 
listings, online purchasing and local city information. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, three major newspaper publishers announced plans to  
reposition their Web sites as ``portals,'' or ports of entry for 
users of the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times, The Washington Post and the Knight Ridder  
newspaper group all unveiled separate plans at a media conference 
in New York to reach out to Web users in their communities in 
different ways. Dow Jones &AMP; Co., publisher of The Wall Street 
Journal, also announced plans in April to roll out a similar 
offering, an all-in-one business financial site. 
</P>
<P>
	With straight news now widely available on the Internet, major  
newspapers want to establish themselves as a leading gateway for 
online advertisers to reach residents of their local communities. 
The companies hope that by boosting advertising they will be able 
to generate profits that have thus far been elusive for most 
newspaper Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan G. Spoon, president and chief operating officer of The  
Washington Post Co., said in a speech that even though the company 
was pleased with the wide use of its Web site so far, ``We're just 
on the threshold of what we believe the Web can offer in terms of 
new services and ultimate profitability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers want and need a convenient entry into the entire  
local online information and commercial marketplace. We want to be 
the first stop on everyone's electronic journey to Washington,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post's upgraded site, due to be launched in the  
fall, will feature entertainment listings, neighborhood news, 
classifieds and online retailing. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times offered fewer specifics about its new Web  
offering. President Russell T. Lewis said the site will ``allow our 
upscale audience to use the Internet to obtain high-quality 
information in a variety of content areas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Ridder, chief executive of the Knight Ridder group, said  
his company is preparing to transform its newspaper Web sites into 
a nationwide network of regional Internet portals. Knight Ridder 
already links together the Web sites of 29 of it newspapers -- and 
16 other sites -- under a site called www.realcities.com. 
</P>
<P>
	The new project, ``Real Cities 2,'' would transform these sites  
into regional hubs in the top 25 U.S. advertising markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight Ridder is partnering with other newspaper companies in  
the project including A.H. Belo Corp., publisher of the Dallas 
Morning News, and Central Newspapers Inc., publisher of the Arizona 
Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street analysts present at the three-day conference, which  
was organized by the newspaper group Gannett Co., welcomed the 
publishers' promises to move more aggressively on the Internet, but 
reserved judgment on whether the strategies would succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a recognition that they need to move beyond the news,''  
said Lauren Rich Fine, a leading publishing industry analyst who 
works for Merrill Lynch. ``People don't only want the local news -- 
they want more entertainment listings and other services. It 
doesn't mean they're going to be successful, but it's an important 
change in mindset.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some newspaper executives struck a cautious tone at the  
conference about the need to keep up with the challenges posed by 
the new medium. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking Wednesday on his company's plans to expand its online  
offerings of classified advertising -- a classic cash cow for 
newspaper companies -- Hollinger International Inc. vice president 
Frederic Lebolt said: ``We're not one to be standing around 
nibbling the leaves while a meteor called the Internet comes 
hurtling toward us.''

<HEADLINE>  Dow Down 54.77; Nasdaq Down 5.02 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly lower today as persistent  
concerns about interest rates sent bond prices tumbling. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 54.77 at 10,666.86. The blue-chip index lost 94.35 points 
yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index was down 6.34 at 1,324.53, and the Nasdaq composite index 
was off 5.02 at 2,575.24. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock and bond markets remained on edge as they awaited the  
Federal Reserve's meeting next week on interest rates. The Fed is 
widely expected to push rates higher in a bid to slow economic 
growth. Market players remain divided, however, on whether the Fed 
will raise rates more than once. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market continues to mark time,'' said Alan Ackerman,  
senior vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. in New York. ``People are 
very conflicted by fear of what the Fed will do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rates rose in the bond market in response to that uncertainty;  
today, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond, which moves in the 
opposite direction to prices, rose to 6.11 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks, which ended a five-session rally on Tuesday,  
appeared vulnerable once more. After the close of trading Tuesday, 
3Com reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that beat 
expectations, but warned that sales of some of its key products may 
slip. Today, 3Com lost 4 1/4 to 27 1/4 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the Nasdaq's losses were hemmed in by modest gains from  
major names like Cisco Systems, up 3/4 at 60 1/4. Also, a new round of 
merger speculation surrounding several smaller Internet players 
stimulated some buying. Earthlink Network rose 4 15/16 to 62 3/16 
amid rumors that it may be acquired by computer maker Gateway. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman Sachs fell 2 1/4 to 65 3/4 after reporting second-quarter  
results that beat analysts' expectations. Goldman mirrored the 
Tuesday performance of rival brokerage Lehman Brothers, which fell 
after announcing strong earnings. Goldman's stock rose Tuesday as 
Wall Street anticipated good results, and traders were taking 
profits today. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by nearly 2-to-1 on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 316.8 million shares, 
slightly behind Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 3.04 at 630.07, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was up 0.43 at 765.53.

<HEADLINE> Nike Opens Online Store </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Air Jordan launched into cyberspace Monday  
with ``nike.com,'' an online shopping center that allows Web 
surfers to order Nike's latest line of shoes, apparel and 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of our customers will have to develop the habit of  
ordering online or getting information about our products online 
and then going into the store and buying them,'' said Mary Kate 
Buckley, manager of Nike's Web site superstore. 
</P>
<P>
	The new, redesigned site was up and running, but Buckley said it  
would be Wednesday before the athletic shoe giant would know how 
many orders were filed on opening day. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of the Beaverton-based company would not say how much  
online business they project, but Buckley said it would be only a 
small percentage of their $9 billion in annual sales. In the 
initial months, the online service will sell just half of the 
company's footwear line and only 30 percent of its clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Three months ago we launched a small test site that taught us  
a lot about the potential of e-commerce and consumer preferences,'' 
Buckley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Visitors navigate the site by sorting through products broken  
down by sport, including tennis, football, fitness, running, 
basketball, soccer and golf. The site also features news updates on 
products, athletes and sporting events. 
</P>
<P>
	Visitors can even click on a special section called  
``Movie-Maker,'' which allows them to use Nike imagery and sound 
tracks to make multimedia messages that can be e-mailed to friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate to characterize anything as cool,'' said Bob Lambie,  
the site's Web designer. ``But the overriding characteristic of 
this site is a sense of fun. Sports is fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While projected Internet sales are low, analysts say it's  
important for companies simply to have a presence on the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a matter of credibility,'' said Brian Murphy, editor of  
Connecticut-based Sports Marketing Letter.

big enough and important enough, it certainly must have a Web

	Murphy said Internet businesses are still trying to prove  
themselves but often have an advantage of low overhead because they 
can sell directly to the consumer and avoid the middle man.

	``Whatever you can sell effectively in a catalog, you can sell

<HEADLINE> Florsheim Chief Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The chairman and chief executive officer of  
Florsheim Group Inc. has resigned amid accusations of sexual 
misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles J. Campbell, 54, who has held his positions with the  
shoe company since 1995, resigned Tuesday, six weeks after a 
lawsuit filed by his former assistant accused him of lewd behavior 
and misusing company assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathleen B. Cavanaugh's lawsuit alleges that Campbell, who is  
married, met mistresses at Florsheim's corporate apartment during 
the day, arranged for them to join him on business trips and had 
sexual liaisons in company-leased limousines. 
</P>
<P>
	She also claimed Campbell kept pornography in his office and  
said his behavior caused her severe emotional distress. She did not 
accuse Campbell of making advances toward her. 
</P>
<P>
	Cavanaugh's attorney, David Latham, said his client's lawsuit  
has been settled. Details of the settlement were not released. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell denied the charges at the company's annual meeting last  
month, saying an investigation, which was conducted by outside 
auditors, would vindicate him. He did not issue a statement 
Tuesday, and the company announcement made no mention of the 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Florsheim said David Sanguinetti, chief operating officer, and  
Richard Anglin, the company's chief financial officer, will serve 
as co-presidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials declined the give details of Campbell's severance  
package. Last year, his total compensation was $532,300.

<HEADLINE> NBA Finals Ratings Droop / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- His Airness is sorely missed at NBC.  
</P>
<P>
	Television ratings for the first three games of the National  
Basketball Association finals last week were down 35 percent from 
last year's finals, Michael Jordan's swan song for the six-time 
champion Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday night's second game between the New York Knicks and San  
Antonio Spurs had the lowest prime-time rating for a finals game 
since 1978, except for the 1994 game that was interrupted by O.J. 
Simpson's freeway chase. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, after basically a decade of the greatest athlete of  
this generation, we're due for a building year,'' NBC Sports 
chairman Dick Ebersol said, ``and this may be ours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	America's unfamiliarity with Spurs' stars Tim Duncan and David  
Robinson were also blamed for the fall-off, along with the 
increasingly low-scoring games. Friday's win by the Spurs narrowly 
missed being the lowest-scoring finals game ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, the first two games of series, played Wednesday and  
Friday, finished first and third, respectively, on the list of most 
watched shows in prime time last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday night's third game gave some hope to both NBC and the  
Knicks, who are now down 2-1 in the series. Its 12.1 rating in 
preliminary Nielsen Media Research ratings was the best of the 
first three games. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC and CBS had identical 6.9 ratings and 13 prime-time audience  
shares for the week that ended Sunday, but NBC's total audience was 
slightly higher. ABC had a 5.5 rating and 10 share and Fox was at 
4.3 and 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the emerging networks, the WB had a 2.2 rating and 4  
share, UPN had a 1.5 and 3, and Pax TV was at 0.7 and 1, Nielsen 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS' special on the American Film Institute's top stars did  
well, finishing tied for 15th in the week's ratings. Fox's showing 
of the Blockbuster Awards came in 31st. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's ``World News Tonight'' and NBC's ``Nightly News'' ended  
the evening news competition in a dead heat with 6.7 ratings and 16 
shares. The ``CBS Evening News'' had a 5.9 rating and 14 share. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of June 14-20, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were: ``NBA Finals, Game 1: New York at San Antonio,'' NBC, 
11.5; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 10.0; ``NBA Finals, Game 2: New York at 
San Antonio,'' NBC, 9.6; ``Frasier,'' NBC, 9.3; ``Friends,'' NBC, 
8.9; ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' NBC, 8.8; ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' CBS, 
8.7; ``Becker,'' CBS, 8.6; ``Dateline NBC-Monday,'' NBC, 8.6; 
``Dateline NBC-Tuesday,'' NBC, 8.5; ``NBA Finals Tip-Off, Game 1,'' 
NBC, 8.5; ``Touched By an Angel,'' CBS, 8.5.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices have opened lower. The Dow Jones

	The Nasdaq Composite Index is down ten points and the S&AMP;P 500

	There's not necessarily anything new for the market to study --  
no economic releases, no speeches by Alan Greenspan and no 
interventions in the foreign currency markets. 
</P>
<P>
	But bond market interest rates are moving higher for a third  
straight day. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Inkster Sets LPGA Championship Goal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Winning two major championships as a  
rookie 15 years ago only made Juli Inkster hungry to win them all. 
Perhaps that's why the LPGA Championship means more to her now than 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's huge,'' she said Wednesday at Dupont Country Club.  
</P>
<P>
	Inkster had gone 10 years without winning a major until she  
overwhelmed Old Waverly to take the U.S. Women's Open three weeks 
ago. Having won the Dinah Shore and the du Maurier Classic in 1984, 
a victory this week will join her with Pat Bradley as the only 
women to win the modern Grand Slam. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to have to have another great week to do it,''  
Inkster said. ``It's been a little hectic in my lifestyle, and I 
just have to focus on my golf game. But I think I can do it. I 
think I have as good a chance as anybody else out there right 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She certainly has as much confidence.  
</P>
<P>
	After taking a week to soak up her victory in the Open -- she  
even threw out the first pitch at a San Francisco Giants game -- 
Inkster was only two strokes off the lead last week in the ShopRite 
Classic before finishing third. 
</P>
<P>
	A victory there would have inched her closer to the Hall of  
Fame, her ultimate goal. All Inkster needs is three points. Two 
points are awarded for a major, and one each for a regular LPGA 
victory, a player of the year award or winning the Vare Trophy for 
lowest scoring average. 
</P>
<P>
	The more immediate prize is the Grand Slam.  
</P>
<P>
	Only one woman has won all four majors since the Dinah Shore  
became a major in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a pretty difficult task,'' Bradley said. ``You're dealing  
with majors, which aren't your everyday, ordinary tournaments. But 
I think if anybody has the savvy to do it, Juli is perfectly 
qualified for that task.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is, Inkster isn't the only player capable of winning  
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The defending champion is Se Ri Pak, who won last week in  
Atlantic City, N.J., for the first time this year. All four of 
Pak's victories in 1998, when she became the first rookie since 
Inkster to win two majors, came during a 10-week stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes a good feeling to this week,'' Pak said.  
</P>
<P>
	Karrie Webb seems to have good feelings every time she tees it  
up. Her victory in Rochester two weeks ago was her fifth this year, 
and she also added to her modern LPGA record of 16 consecutive 
top-10 finishes. 
</P>
<P>
	Still only 24, Webb has done everything but win a major. She got  
a pretty good idea of the euphoria that follows when she bumped 
into Inkster on Tuesday for the first time since Old Waverly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just talking to her, it was like she won it yesterday,'' Webb  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of all the majors, the LPGA Championship is the one that has  
been the least kind to Inkster. Her best finish was a tie for third 
in 1986, which happened to be the year Bradley won in Kings Island, 
Ohio, to complete the Grand Slam. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe it's in the cards this week for Inkster. After all,  
Bradley was stuck on two majors that year until winning the Dinah 
Shore and the LPGA Championship in a matter of six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Juli showed her stuff at the Open, and I know she's going to  
carry the confidence into this week,'' Bradley said. ``If anybody 
can join the club, Juli is the one who can do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mickey Wright, whose swing Ben Hogan said was the best he ever  
saw, is the only other woman to win all four majors, which from 
1955-66 consisted of the U.S. Open, the LPGA Championship, the 
Titleholders and the Western Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Inkster could join some pretty elite company this week, although  
her window of opportunity is closing fast. Her daughters are 9 and 
5, and Inkster has said she'll play a full schedule only through 
next year's Solheim Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	And with each year, the quest to win the fourth major will  
become even more of a burden. 
</P>
<P>
	Amy Alcott, inducted into the Hall of Fame three months ago, is  
the only other player in the field who can win the career Grand 
Slam this week. Stuck on three majors since 1983, the 43-year-old 
Alcott finished one stroke behind Sherri Turner in the 1988 LPGA 
Championship and hasn't come close to winning it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it will be quite the amount of pressure of going  
for the Grand Slam in one year,'' Bradley said. ``Besides, if she 
can withstand the pressure that transpired in the Open ... compared 
to that tournament, this will be a cake walk.''

	Marines Kill One in Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. Marines manning a checkpoint in Kosovo  
were shot at today by unidentified assailants and then returned 
fire, killing one person and wounding two, U.S. officials said. 
Army Brig. Gen. John Craddock, the commander of U.S. forces in 
Kosovo, said no Marines were injured. Craddock said he had not yet 
learned whether the assailants were Serbs or ethnic Albanians. 
After the interview, Pentagon officials said the assailants had 
surrendered. They apparently numbered about a half dozen, were 
dressed in civilian clothes and were armed with AK-47 weapons.

	Railroad Killer in Ky. Last Week  
</P>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The railroad drifter suspected in eight killings  
was in Louisville, Ky., as recently as Friday, the FBI said today. 
The agency said interviews with witnesses suggested Rafael 
Resendez-Ramirez had frequented a downtown homeless shelter. 
Investigators believe Resendez-Ramirez is making his way from town 
to town by hopping freight trains. He is also believed to be a 
master of disguise, using glasses, facial hair and aliases to hide 
his identity. Fingerprints have tied him to at least some of the 
killings. 

</P>
<P>
	More Charges Filed in Columbine  
</P>
<P>
	GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- A man accused of selling a handgun that was  
used in the Columbine High School massacre was charged today with 
an additional count -- possession of a sawed-off shotgun. Mark 
Manes, 22, who was allowed to remain free on bond, also has been 
charged with selling the TEC-DC9 9 mm pistol that Eric Harris and 
Dylan Klebold used to kill 12 students and one teacher. They ended 
the April 20 rampage by killing themselves. The TEC-9 charge 
carries a sentence of 2 to 6 years, but could go as high as 12 
years if a judge finds extraordinary circumstances.

Hillary Rodham Clinton as a potential witness for the trial of 
former law partner Webster Hubbell, legal sources said today. The 
independent counsel's office submitted Mrs. Clinton's name April 21 
as one of 63 potential witnesses in the Hubbell case, said the 
sources. Mrs. Clinton is pondering a race for Senate seat from New 
York.

	Belgium: Food Scare Under Control  
</P>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The Belgian government tried to  
convince a suspicious world today that its dioxin food scandal was 
under control, despite a surprise shift in suspicions over who was 
to blame. The government said yesterday that a Spanish producer of 
fat used in animal feed was responsible for the dioxin 
contamination. Up until then, authorities had blamed a Belgian fat 
producer 110 miles away. Despite the change, Belgian Health 
Minister Luc Van den Bossche insisted the number of farms affected 
by the contamination is the same because both companies had the 
same customers.

	Priest Charged in Smuggling  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A Catholic priest who took a vow of poverty was  
charged today with trying to smuggle into the country $2.4 billion 
in amateurish counterfeit Treasury notes. Father Mario 
Beato-Prieto, 35, a Spanish citizen who was running a parochial 
school in the Philippines, was arrested yesterday at Kennedy 
Airport after U.S. Customs agents discovered he was carrying the 
fake currency in his luggage. But the notes looked more like $100 
million bills adorned with a likeness of Grover Cleveland, marred 
by typos and runny ink.

completed a three-game sweep with a 9-6 win over the San Francisco 
Giants. Burnitz led off the fifth with a homer into the upper deck 
in right field and hit his 19th homer of the season in the seventh, 
a shot off the foul pole in right. Mark Loretta and Jeff Cirillo 
each added two-run singles for the Brewers, who have won a 
season-high five-straight games.

	Marines Kill 2 Assailants in Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. Marines manning a checkpoint in Kosovo  
came under fire today by unidentified assailants and then returned 
fire, killing two people. No Marines were injured, U.S. officials 
said. It was not immediately known whether the two people killed 
were military or civilian or whether they were Serbs or ethnic 
Albanians. It was the second time U.S. forces have come under fire 
during their peacekeeping mission in Kosovo. Monday night soldiers 
from the 82nd Airborne Division, operating near the city of 
Urosevac, were fired upon but not injured.

	FBI Aids in Kosovo War Crimes Probe  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists and crime scene experts from the  
FBI began work today at the sites of two alleged massacres in 
Kosovo and will turn over their findings to war crimes prosecutors 
pursuing Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, the agency's chief 
said. A team of 59 agents, chemists, forensic dentists and other 
specialists are working inside a house where prosecutors assert 
that 20 people were herded and shot by Serb troops. The FBI will 
also excavate another site in the same Kosovo town, Djakovica, 
where prosecutors allege six ethnic Albanian men were executed and 
buried in March.

	Yugoslavia Urged To Free Prisoners

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Amnesty International urged the

bombardment. International observers estimate 2,000 political 
prisoners, mostly ethnic Albanians, remain in Serb custody. Amnesty 
said people have been detained for expressing dissenting views, 
refusing military service, and taking part in protests.

	Attraction-Menstrual Cycle Linked  
</P>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A new study indicates the kind of man's face a  
woman finds attractive varies with her menstrual cycle. The study 
conducted by Scottish and Japanese researchers and published in 
tomorrow's issue of the journal Nature said when a woman is 
ovulating, or ready to conceive, she is likely to prefer men with 
more masculine features. When she is menstruating, or least likely 
to get pregnant, she is apt to prefer softer, more feminine looks. 
Researchers did note that social and cultural factors, including 
common interests and backgrounds, also govern choice of mate.

on a charge of violating the state's cross-burning ban. Barry 
Black, an imperial wizard with the International Keystone Knights 
of the Klan, is accused of leading a Klan rally at which 18 robed 
and hooded people held torches as they stood around a 25-foot 
flaming cross. Lawyer David Baugh said he despises the KKK, but

earnings,'' Bloomberg told the American Chamber of Commerce in

game. Doctors expect Dierker to make a full recovery and return to 
the dugout after the All-Star break in mid-July. The 52-year-old 
was diagnosed with arteriovenous malformation, a condition in which 
people are born with malformed arteries in the brain.

<HEADLINE> U.S. OKs More Flights to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- The U.S. government has given tentative approval  
for three American airlines to make 17 more round-trip flights each 
week to China, the U.S. Embassy said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest Airlines and the cargo carrier Federal Express will  
get six flights and United Airlines five, according to a statement 
quoting U.S. Transportation Secretary Rodney E. Slater.

<P>
	The United States won agreement from China in April to double  
the number of flights between the countries as part of Chinese 
efforts to join the World Trade Organization.

	The plan includes new direct flights by United from San  
Francisco to Shanghai and by Northwest from Detroit to Beijing and 
Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> Ozawa To Direct Vienna State Opera </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Seiji Ozawa, the Boston Symphony's  
longtime conductor, is stepping down in August 2002 to become music 
director of the Vienna State Opera for what he called ``the last 
directorship of my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after today's announcement in Vienna, the Berlin  
Philharmonic ended its own lengthy search for one of the classical 
music world's most prestigious posts by selecting Sir Simon Rattle 
to be its chief conductor after Claudio Abbado retires in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Ozawa, 63, has led the Boston Symphony Orchestra since 1973,  
longer than any other music director in its 117-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	State Opera director Ioan Holender said Ozawa agreed to lead the  
company for at least three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Cultural officials attending the Vienna news conference  
alongside Ozawa appeared elated at his decision to accept. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe, that it will give the reputation of this house  
another boost,'' said Peter Wittmann, state secretary of cultural 
affairs. ``The state opera is one of the best opera houses in the 
world ... and (Ozawa) is one of the world's best musicians.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ozawa, who flew to Vienna from Germany for the announcement,  
said, ``I think I will enjoy the last directorship of my life. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me the (Vienna) opera house has a wonderful orchestra, a  
wonderful chorus and very good music staff and very good singers, 
... and that is a very happy thing for a conductor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Berlin, orchestra chairman Rudolf Watzel announced the  
appointment of Rattle, the 44-year-old British conductor who has 
led the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra to international 
fame. Rattle was chosen over conductor Daniel Barenboim in a vote 
by orchestra members, Watzel said. Barenboim is musical director of 
the German State Opera in Berlin and the Chicago Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston Symphony officials said a committee would be formed this  
summer to search for a successor. The BSO will be competing with 
several other major orchestras searching for music directors, 
including the New York Philharmonic and the Philadelphia Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vienna's gain is certainly Boston's loss,'' said Nicholas T.  
Zervas, president of the Boston Symphony's trustees. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vienna State Opera has been without a music director since  
Abbado left in 1991 for health reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Holender has been the director for artistic and business  
management. 
</P>
<P>
	Ozawa's announcement comes at the end of a seasonlong  
celebration of his quarter-century in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	He is credited with maintaining the orchestra's status as a  
world-class ensemble and helping to make the Tanglewood Music 
Center in western Massachusetts a premier summer music center. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Ozawa also caused controversy at Tanglewood when he  
fired the training institute's longtime director, Richard Ortner, 
in 1996. Many faculty members resigned in protest. 
</P>
<P>
	Ozawa came to Tanglewood as a nearly broke, 25-year-old student  
from Japan, speaking almost no English. 
</P>
<P>
	He established himself by winning the Koussevitzky Prize for  
outstanding student conductor at Tanglewood and in 1961 became 
assistant conductor of the New York Philharmonic under Leonard 
Bernstein, who was on Tanglewood's faculty. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter distributed to BSO members, Ozawa cited a desire to  
perform more operatic selections as a deciding factor in accepting 
the job in Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
	``My relationship with the great Boston Symphony Orchestra has  
and continues to be the most rewarding artistic experience that a 
musician could ever hope to have. I would never leave the Boston 
Symphony for another orchestra. However, in my own growth as a 
musician, I increasingly have come to love the operatic 
repertoire.''

<HEADLINE>  Stocks End Mixed; Dow Is Off 54.77 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks fell for a third straight  
session Wednesday as persistent concerns about interest rates sent 
bond prices tumbling. Bank and brokerage stocks, which stand to 
lose the most if rates go up, suffered sharp declines. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 54.77 to close at  
10,666.86 after falling nearly 105 points earlier in the session. 
The blue-chip index lost 94.35 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
fell 2.82 to 1,333.06, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq 
composite index rose 17.86 to 2,598.12. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock and bond markets remained on edge as they awaited the  
Federal Reserve's meeting next week on interest rates. The Fed is 
widely expected to push rates higher in a bid to slow economic 
growth. Market players remain divided, however, on whether the Fed 
will raise rates more than once. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market continues to mark time,'' said Alan Ackerman,  
senior vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. in New York. ``People are 
very conflicted by fear of what the Fed will do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd.,  
said that while many traders are beginning to accept the 
possibility of two rate increases, some fear the Fed will raise 
rates three times, wiping out the rate cuts that the central bank 
initiated last fall to help protect the global economy from Asia's 
financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Three steps and a stumble,'' Bleier said. ``There's a belief  
that the bull market could not survive three rate increases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rates rose in the bond market in response to that uncertainty.  
The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond, which moves in the opposite 
direction from prices, rose to 6.14 percent from late Tuesday's 
6.06 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The threat of higher rates hammered bank and brokerage stocks  
Wednesday. Those business are especially vulnerable to higher 
rates, which can discourage borrowers and hurt lending volume. J.P. 
Morgan, down 4 3/8 to 130 5/8, was the biggest decliner among Dow 
components. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong second-quarter earnings report from Goldman Sachs  
couldn't save the elite investment bank from the sector's weakness. 
Goldman's shares fell 3 to 65, mirroring the Tuesday performance of 
rival brokerage Lehman Brothers, which dropped after its own solid 
earnings report. 
</P>
<P>
	Both brokerages rose earlier this week as Wall Street  
anticipated good results, and analysts said traders were 
undoubtedly taking profits. But Ackerman said the brokerages are 
also paying a price for investors' interest rate jitters. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this market, good news is met with relief, but doesn't  
necessarily engender any additional commitment,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks, which ended a five-session rally on Tuesday,  
managed a slight rebound. Merger speculation about several smaller 
Internet players stimulated buying. Earthlink Network rose 4 to 61 1/4 
amid rumors it might be acquired by computer maker Gateway. 
</P>
<P>
	Network provider Cisco Systems rose 2 7/16 to 61 15/16 on the  
Nasdaq. But rival networking company 3Com fell 4 3/8 to 27 1/8 a day 
after reporting fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that beat 
expectations. Company officials warned that sales of some of its 
key products might slip, prompting investment firms to downgrade 
their ratings of 3Com's stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil companies got a boost from the American Petroleum  
Institute's Tuesday report that showed the nation's crude oil 
supplies fell 1.7 percent last week. Chevron rose 2 1/2 to 92 5/8, the 
strongest performer among Dow components. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-5 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange. NYSE composite volume totaled 880.27 
million shares, compared with 878.96 million in the previous 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the weak volume illustrated investors' reluctance  
to take major new positions until the Fed's meeting next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 2.36 to 630.75, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 5.69 to 771.16. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.29 to 447.04. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas indexes were mostly lower. Japan's Nikkei stock average  
closed down 1.07 percent. Germany's DAX index fell 1.3 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 0.9 percent, and France's CAC-40 
closed down 1.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> Chevron To Cut 2,500 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Calif. (AP) -- Chevron Corp. will cut 2,500 jobs --  
about 1,500 more than it said last year -- as it struggles to combat 
falling oil prices and compete with merging rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, the oil giant said it would lay off about 1,000  
people in an attempt to reduce its annual expenses by $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest push to slash costs through mergers and other  
measures reflects the industry's belief that oil prices will remain 
relatively low for several years. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past year, several major oil companies have paired off,  
including Exxon and Mobil and BP Amoco and Arco. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron had been negotiating to purchase Texaco until Texaco  
management abruptly called off the talks earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chevron is still sitting there without a partner, so they may  
be taking a more proactive approach,'' said Brian Eisenbarth, an 
oil industry analyst for Collins &AMP; Co. in Larkspur. ``There may not 
be another combination out there to their liking, so they may be 
figuring they better be prepared down the road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Early retirement packages will be offered to 7 percent of  
Chevron's worldwide payroll, costing the company $150 million in 
the quarter ending June 30, Chairman Kenneth Derr said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A fire in March that damaged a 41,000 barrel-per-day unit at  
Chevron's Richmond refinery contributed to a perceived gasoline 
shortage that drove up gasoline prices. Derr said the Richmond 
accident and several other refinery problems also will lower its 
second-quarter operating earnings by $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	A substantial portion of the job cuts are expected to occur in  
the San Francisco Bay area, where 8,100, or 24 percent of Chevron's 
employees work. 
</P>
<P>
	If Chevron doesn't persuade enough volunteers to accept the  
early retirement package, the company will lay off employees, said 
company spokesman Mike Libbey.

<HEADLINE> Qwest Restructures Takeover Bids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The takeover battle for U S West Inc. and  
Frontier Corp. heated up Wednesday as Qwest revised its $46.5 
billion bids for the telephone companies in hopes of striking a 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West, a Denver-based Baby Bell, and Frontier, the nation's  
No. 5 long-distance phone company, both rebuffed Qwest's original 
offer in favor of a merger proposal from Global Crossing Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies acknowledged they had received the new proposals  
and were reviewing them, but declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing and Qwest Communications International Inc. are  
racing to build fiber-optic cable networks that span the globe. The 
two companies want to provide high-speed audio, video and data 
communications via the Internet, and they want to sell their 
services to the 27 million customers of U S West and Frontier. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet is revolutionizing the telecommunications industry  
and is driving a string of merger bids, such as AT&AMP;T Corp.'s 
pending acquisition of cable company MediaOne. Companies are hoping 
that the next generation of high-speed Internet technologies will 
link more homes and businesses, providing a wealth of new 
opportunities to sell goods and provide information and 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have modified our offers to respond to the concerns  
Frontier and U S West expressed ... that they be given downside 
protection'' from volatility in Qwest's stock price, said Joseph P. 
Nacchio, chairman and chief executive of Qwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver-based Qwest is now offering to pay $69 a share in stock  
for U S West, and $68 a share in cash and stock for Frontier. Those 
prices will be locked in place as long as Qwest's shares trade 
between $43.50 and $30.40. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest's shares nose-dived as much as 24 percent last week,  
eroding the value of the company's initial $55 billion takeover 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
	The new bid did little to assuage Qwest investors, who sent the  
company's stock down $2.75 to $32.56 1/4 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	The new offer is about 12 percent more than Global Crossing's  
$41.7 billion offer, which also is structured to protect the value 
against moderate swings in its stock price. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing's chairman and chief executive, Robert  
Annunziata, issued a statement saying, ``We remain committed to our 
definitive merger agreements and have no plans to take any action 
at this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several investors and analysts that follow Qwest said the new  
terms should improve the company's chances of winning the takeover 
fight, but at the same time, they also criticized Qwest's plans to 
buy slow-growth companies with dated technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly there are many people who are skeptical, as I am, that  
this is the right path to be pursuing,'' said Tom Friedberg, an 
analyst with Janco Partners Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the pounding Qwest's shares have taken -- an overall drop  
of 27 percent since the initial bid -- there are some investors who 
support the move. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's probably the right move for the shareholders who end up  
looking at this when the dust settles,'' said Brian Hayward, 
portfolio manager of the Invesco Utilities fund, which is a large 
investor in Qwest and Global Crossing. ``I feel comfortable with 
the way Qwest explained their thinking on taking on U S West.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under its revised offer, Qwest is will pay $20 in cash and $48  
in stock (about 1.359 shares) for each share of Frontier. Qwest 
will give U S West shareholders $69 worth of its stock (about 1.954 
shares) for each share of U S West they hold. 
</P>
<P>
	At Qwest's current stock price, the new offer is actually lower  
than its original bid, in which Frontier would have received $20 in 
cash and $55 in stock (then 1.181 shares), and U S West would have 
received $80 in stock (then 1.738 shares). 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, Bermuda-based Global Crossing is offering $63 a  
share in cash and stock for Frontier, and about $61.14 a share in 
stock for U S West. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Wednesday, U S West's shares rose $1 to $58 on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where Frontier's stock jumped $1.87 1/2 to 
$59.87 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing's stock dropped $1.56 1/4 to $45.87 1/2 on the Nasdaq.

<HEADLINE>  Thompson, McHale in Hall of Fame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- Georgetown and the Boston Celtics --  
for years standards of excellence in basketball -- sent two of their 
finest to the Hall of Fame on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	John Thompson, the combative coach who made the Hoyas a national  
power, entered the hall with Kevin McHale, the long-armed forward 
who helped the Celtics win three titles. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson became the first black coach to win an NCAA title in  
1984. He had been nominated twice before for the Hall of Fame but 
said his political stands might have hurt his chances. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll probably be remembered for all the things that kept me  
out of the Hall of Fame, ironically, more than for the things that 
got me into it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He boycotted two games in protest of NCAA Proposition 42 in  
1989, contending the rule hurt minority students. 
</P>
<P>
	Also entering the Hall of Fame were former NBA center and  
general manager Wayne Embry; Billie Moore, the first women's coach 
to lead two schools to national championships; and the late Fred 
Zollner, the NBA pioneer who owned the Fort Wayne and Detroit 
Pistons. The five will be inducted Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, 6-foot-10, was the Celtics' backup center for Bill  
Russell on the 1965 and 1966 championship teams. He arrived as 
Georgetown's coach in 1972 and inherited a 3-23 program. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coaching happened to me by accident,'' he said Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	With a towel draped over his shoulder and an authoritative grip  
on his team, Georgetown became a college basketball force. 
</P>
<P>
	During the next 27 seasons, his Hoya teams went 596-239. They  
made the NCAA tournament 14 straight times, played in three Final 
Fours, and beat Houston for the national championship in 1984. He 
sent Patrick Ewing, Alonzo Mourning and Dikembe Mutombo to the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson also coached the 1988 U.S. Olympic men's team, winning  
a bronze medal. 
</P>
<P>
	In January he surprisingly retired in midseason for personal  
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	McHale established himself in 12 seasons with Robert Parish and  
Larry Bird. The trio formed one of the best NBA frontcourts, 
leading the Celtics to championships in 1981, 1984 and 1986. Boston 
has won 16 NBA titles, more than any other team. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you get honored for something you have so much fun doing,  
it just doesn't feel right,'' McHale said. ``I never thought of it 
as work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brought to the Celtics in 1980 with Parish, McHale at first  
played as a sixth man. The 6-foot-10 forward displayed a touch and 
moves around the basket that became a modern standard for big men. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very deserving,'' said Bird, who now coaches the Indiana  
Pacers. ``There was never any doubt in my mind he would make it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hall of Famer Julius Erving said McHale worked hard on his moves  
when he joined the NBA and became ``an unstoppable offensive 
player, which opened things up for Bird and Parish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McHale, easygoing off the court, often provided a foil to Bird's  
intensity. 
</P>
<P>
	``His not taking the game seriously helped him maintain a level  
personality and not have as many ups and downs,'' said Jim Dutcher, 
who coached McHale at Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	During his career, he averaged 17.9 points and 7.3 rebounds and  
shot 55 percent. He made seven All-Star teams and three All-NBA 
defensive teams. He is now vice president of basketball operations 
for the Minnesota Timberwolves. 
</P>
<P>
	Embry also has a Celtics link as a member of the 1968 title  
team. He was picked for his overall contributions to the sport. In 
1971, he became general manager of the Milwaukee Bucks as the first 
black in that NBA position. In April, he quit as general manager of 
the Cleveland Cavaliers. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore won her Cal State Fullerton national crown in 1970 and her  
UCLA national title in 1978. She went 436-196 during her 24-season 
coaching career and coached the first U.S. Olympic women's 
basketball team to a silver medal in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	Zollner brought the Pistons to Detroit in 1957. He is credited  
with many innovations, including the 24-second shot clock, wider 
foul lane and six-foul limit. He was one of the league's first 
owners to buy a plane for his team's road games.

<HEADLINE> Books and Authors: Carolyn Chute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARSONSFIELD, Maine (AP) -- Black flies and big business.  
Typewriter troubles and feminist reviewers. 
</P>
<P>
	Novelist Carolyn Chute's description of the annoyances,  
resentments and rebelliousness in American life is writ large and 
small in her conversation, same as in ``The Beans of Egypt, Maine'' 
and her other writing. 
</P>
<P>
	Nature's pests are to be expected here in the hills and valleys  
of western Maine. But the pressures she sees keeping down the poor 
and less privileged -- for her, victims of ``the Wall Street 
religion'' -- draw stern rebuke from this prophet of populism. 
</P>
<P>
	Chute says she hopes the violent class warfare drawn darkly in  
her latest book, ``Snow Man,'' doesn't come to pass, even as she 
suggests with a shrug that it's already under way. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are either in despair or they're angry. And some people  
are speaking out through one awkward way or another, or dangerous 
way, or whatever,'' Chute says, reflecting on the bloody exploits 
of the book's protagonist, Robert Daniel Drummond. 
</P>
<P>
	Drummond's involvement in a small anti-establishment militia  
group dubbed Snow Men mirrors an interest Chute has developed in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Denouncing the political power of corporations and a virtual  
caste system fostered by elitism in schools, Chute champions a 
barely organized organization of her own, variously known as the 
2nd Maine or the Wicked Good Militia -- ``No phone/ no fax/ no paved 
road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Socializing around target shooting and other rural pastimes, the  
group espouses no fixed ideology. While members have made periodic 
forays to the State House in Augusta to speak out on various 
issues, Chute's militia is more theater than theory. 
</P>
<P>
	At root, Chute's politics match a main motive behind her  
writing: to give voice to people whose lack of social standing and 
conventional sophistication puts them at the mercy of an 
unsympathetic ``professional class.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As such, the rebellion she favors is as much personal as  
political. Chute says working people bypassed by prosperity have 
nothing to lose but their cheerfulness. 
</P>
<P>
	Her philosophy sounds much like Snow Man Drummond's, as when he  
tells his two more cultured lovers with a sneer: ``It ain't left or 
right. It's up and down. You're either up or you're down. That's 
all there is to it. OK?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chute, 51, concedes her activism steals time from her writing.  
But her occasional public speaking and old-fashioned pamphleteering 
have become as much a part of her life as the Scottish terriers she 
and her husband, Michael, keep at their secluded country home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think of the militia as a movement. I think of it as a time  
where people are asking questions, where they are giving themselves 
permission to ask questions. They're giving themselves permission 
to be angry, to not have to fake cheerfulness any more,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're giving themselves permission to have some kind of  
political empowerment, even if it is just to talk, to be together 
and talk about some of the same things that do bother them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chute says she needs to sequester the time for writing,  
``because it takes so much concentration and quiet time to do that. 
... I can't just dash off one day, come home and work a day, dash 
off again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, enjoying the broadening effects of public advocacy, she  
adds, ``I love what I've done. The activism has nourished this, the 
experience of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In pursuing her calling, typewriter troubles are more than just  
an occupational hazard for Chute. For the feisty voice of working 
folks, the difficulty in getting her writing tools repaired 
typifies the tyranny of advanced technology and fuels her 
anti-corporation fervor. 
</P>
<P>
	``They make these daisy wheel things that just snap off after  
about five or 10 pages and it costs 30 bucks to replace them. They 
won't fix them,'' complains Chute, who says staring at a computer 
screen is not for her. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guy who sells them just acts like he doesn't know what I'm  
talking about. `Oh, it does that? Oh.' So what happened was, the 
stationery store where I bought the typewriter, themselves, they 
themselves, not being a corporation, just a little store, said that 
they would send the little things back. And they've been doing that 
for me. But they don't get back quite in enough time. Sometimes I'm 
left with none and I have to wait. It's really slowed me up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chute's work for major publishers -- ``Snow Man'' is published by  
Harcourt Brace &AMP; Co. -- has enveloped her in the corporate realm, a 
fact of life she acknowledges with a rueful laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's all there is. Everything's corporate, everything is  
corporate. But I always bite the hand that feeds me,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	``Snow Man'' took flak in early critiques published by Kirkus  
Reviews and Library Journal -- ``New York I guess is being mean to 
my book.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She says the precarious lives of her characters and their  
roughhewn ways may be beyond the ken of some critics. She takes 
special aim at those who might object to the macho character of 
some of her male figures and belittle the stay-at-home lives of 
some of her women. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know the feminists are going to be mad at me, they're always  
mad, feminists hate me,'' Chute says. ``I'm not a feminist, I'm an 
equalist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Snow Man's encounter with ``professional class'' types can  
be instructive, Chute maintains. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're nice people but they're leaving us all out,'' she  
says.

<HEADLINE> Russia 5, Japan 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Olga Letuchova had two goals and an assist  
and Irina Grigorieva had three assists Wednesday night as Russia 
dominated Japan 5-0 for its first victory in the Women's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	With three points, Russia put itself into position to advance  
from Group C into the quarterfinals. Russia finishes group play 
against Canada on Saturday in New Jersey. Japan faces top-seeded 
Norway on Saturday in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan looked unsure of itself against the more aggressive  
Russians, who won most of the balls against their smaller 
opponents. Japan's impatience on offense also produced some sloppy 
passes. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia was more accurate inside the box and stayed on the attack  
after taking a 1-0 lead at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia took the lead on a shot by Larissa Savina in the 29th  
minute. Savina took a pass from Grigorieva, ran into the left side 
of the box and left-footed the ball past Japan keeper Nozomi Yamago 
into the right corner of the goal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians took a 2-0 lead on another assist by Grigorieva,  
who dribbled to the right corner of the box and sent a cross toward 
the right front post, where Letuchova hit a first-time shot for a 
goal in the 52nd minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Six minutes later, Russia's Natalia Karasseva stole the ball  
from Mito Asaka and launched it from 35 yards. The ball sailed far 
above the backpedaling, 5-foot-5 Yamago for a 3-0 Russian lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia went up 4-0 in the 81st minute when Letuchova, falling  
backward, got a short pass to Natalia Barbachina, who dribbled 
around three defenders and drove an open shot into the right side 
of the goal. 
</P>
<P>
	The final score came on a breakaway when Grigorieva fed  
Letuchova for an easy goal in the 89th minute.

<HEADLINE>  Stocks End Mixed; Dow Is Off 54.77 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks fell for a third straight  
session Wednesday as persistent concerns about interest rates sent 
bond prices tumbling. Bank and brokerage stocks, which stand to 
lose the most if rates go up, suffered sharp declines. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 54.77 to close at  
10,666.86 after falling nearly 105 points earlier in the session. 
The blue-chip index lost 94.35 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
fell 2.82 to 1,333.06, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq 
composite index rose 17.86 to 2,598.12. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock and bond markets remained on edge as they awaited the  
Federal Reserve's meeting next week on interest rates. The Fed is 
widely expected to push rates higher in a bid to slow economic 
growth. Market players remain divided, however, on whether the Fed 
will raise rates more than once. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market continues to mark time,'' said Alan Ackerman,  
senior vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. in New York. ``People are 
very conflicted by fear of what the Fed will do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd.,  
said that while many traders are beginning to accept the 
possibility of two rate increases, some fear the Fed will raise 
rates three times, wiping out the rate cuts that the central bank 
initiated last fall to help protect the global economy from Asia's 
financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Three steps and a stumble,'' Bleier said. ``There's a belief  
that the bull market could not survive three rate increases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rates rose in the bond market in response to that uncertainty.  
The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond, which moves in the opposite 
direction from prices, rose to 6.14 percent from late Tuesday's 
6.06 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The threat of higher rates hammered bank and brokerage stocks  
Wednesday. Those business are especially vulnerable to higher 
rates, which can discourage borrowers and hurt lending volume. J.P. 
Morgan, down 4 3/8 to 130 5/8, was the biggest decliner among Dow 
components. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong second-quarter earnings report from Goldman Sachs  
couldn't save the elite investment bank from the sector's weakness. 
Goldman's shares fell 3 to 65, mirroring the Tuesday performance of 
rival brokerage Lehman Brothers, which dropped after its own solid 
earnings report. 
</P>
<P>
	Both brokerages rose earlier this week as Wall Street  
anticipated good results, and analysts said traders were 
undoubtedly taking profits. But Ackerman said the brokerages are 
also paying a price for investors' interest rate jitters. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this market, good news is met with relief, but doesn't  
necessarily engender any additional commitment,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks, which ended a five-session rally on Tuesday,  
managed a slight rebound. Merger speculation about several smaller 
Internet players stimulated buying. Earthlink Network rose 4 to 61 1/4 
amid rumors it might be acquired by computer maker Gateway. 
</P>
<P>
	Network provider Cisco Systems rose 2 7/16 to 61 15/16 on the  
Nasdaq. But rival networking company 3Com fell 4 3/8 to 27 1/8 a day 
after reporting fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that beat 
expectations. Company officials warned that sales of some of its 
key products might slip, prompting investment firms to downgrade 
their ratings of 3Com's stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil companies got a boost from the American Petroleum  
Institute's Tuesday report that showed the nation's crude oil 
supplies fell 1.7 percent last week. Chevron rose 2 1/2 to 92 5/8, the 
strongest performer among Dow components. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-5 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange. NYSE composite volume totaled 880.27 
million shares, compared with 878.96 million in the previous 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the weak volume illustrated investors' reluctance  
to take major new positions until the Fed's meeting next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 2.36 to 630.75, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 5.69 to 771.16. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.29 to 447.04. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas indexes were mostly lower. Japan's Nikkei stock average  
closed down 1.07 percent. Germany's DAX index fell 1.3 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 0.9 percent, and France's CAC-40 
closed down 1.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> Man Arrested for Faking Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- A man was accused Wednesday of faking  
his death in a scuba accident off the Florida Keys to collect on a 
$1 million life insurance policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerry Steven Scheele, 29, was arrested in Beloit, Wis., and  
faces extradition to Florida. He was charged with application 
fraud, claims fraud and first- and third-degree grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
	Scheele led his estranged wife and others to believe he drowned  
during a lobster diving trip in August 1998, according to Insurance 
Commissioner Bill Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators later tracked him down through phone records  
linked to a girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said Scheele named a girlfriend as beneficiary on  
a $1 million life insurance policy. She left Monroe County within 
days of his reported drowning but not before making a number of 
long-distance phone calls, investigators said.

<HEADLINE> Attraction-Menstrual Cycle Linked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The kind of man's face a woman finds attractive  
varies with her menstrual cycle, according to a study that 
underscores the hold biology still has on us, no matter how highly 
evolved we like to think we are. 
</P>
<P>
	When a woman is ovulating, or ready to conceive, she is likely  
to prefer men with more masculine features. When she is 
menstruating, or least likely to get pregnant, she is apt to prefer 
softer, more feminine looks. 
</P>
<P>
	That's according to a study conducted by Scottish and Japanese  
researchers and published in Thursday's issue of the journal 
Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers believe this is not a matter of fashion or a  
20th century standard of beauty, but something that is inborn, or 
instilled by evolution for sound biological reasons: In the animal 
kingdom, masculine looks denote virility, and thus the ability to 
produce healthy offspring. 
</P>
<P>
	``Literature from the animal kingdom suggests exaggerated male  
features such as peacock feathers and deer antler and other 
masculine features display a good immune system, and that's what 
should be atttractive for females,'' said David Perrett of the 
University of St. Andrews in Scotland, one of the study's authors. 
``And to some extent we are finding that's what's true for 
humans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The findings build on work by the researchers last year that  
suggests women overall prefer male faces that are slightly 
feminized, perhaps because they signal a more cooperative mate for 
long-term child-rearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers note, of course, that biology is not the only thing  
that governs our choice of a mate. Social and cultural factors do, 
too: earning power, common interests and similar backgrounds, for 
example. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings suggest at least one piece of practical dating  
advice: A man who gets rejected by a woman might have more success 
if he asks her out again in a week or two. 
</P>
<P>
	``They should at least try for four weeks on the run,'' Perrett  
said. ``It does imply some persistence is a good strategy for 
males.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, women in Japan and Scotland were shown  
computer-generated male faces that had been altered in their level 
of masculinity -- including the size of the jaw, eyebrow ridge, and 
overall size. 
</P>
<P>
	All of these masculine features are caused by testosterone, the  
male hormone. Similarly, in women, estrogen causes breasts, fuller 
hips, a smaller chin and full lips -- all features that denote 
fertility and are generally considered most appealing to men. 
</P>
<P>
	The 39 Japanese women were questioned about their menstrual  
cycles and later were shown five white and five Japanese faces on 
two occasions, when they were most likely and least likely to 
become pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
	For Japanese and white faces, the women preferred faces that  
were on average about 20 percent and 15 percent feminized, 
respectively, when they were least likely to become pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
	When they were most likely to become pregnant, the women  
preferred faces that were only about 8 percent feminized for both 
groups of images. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second experiment, 65 British women were asked over a  
three- to four-week period to choose the most attractive face for 
long-term and short-term sexual relationships. The women used a 
computer that allowed them to make a composite face more or less 
feminine. 
</P>
<P>
	For short-term relationships, the preferred faces were about 15  
percent feminized during low-conception risk periods, vs. about 8 
percent during high-conception risk periods. For long-term 
relationships, the preferred faces were about 10 percent feminized 
throughout the month. 
</P>
<P>
	Women on the pill, which controls the monthly hormonal cycle,  
were excluded from the Japanese study. But in the British 
experiment, these women picked a certain kind of face without 
varying their preferences. 
</P>
<P>
	This raises troubling questions about the effect of the pill on  
evolution, said Victor Johnston, a professor of psychology at New 
Mexico State University who runs a Web site that allows people to 
register their preferences for computer-generated faces. 
</P>
<P>
	``By manipulating steroid levels,'' he asked, ``are we changing  
our preference for the opposite sex? And how is that affecting the 
population?''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Down Vs. Euro; Up Vs. Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The euro flirted with new lows against the  
dollar Wednesday, then rebounded late in the day as falling U.S. 
blue-chip stocks undercut the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	But the dollar eked out a gain against the yen on anticipation  
that the Bank of Japan once more was going to intervene to protect 
the economy's attempt at recovery by keeping the yen from gaining 
ground. A top official said the Japanese were prepared to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar rose to 121.92 Japanese yen  
from 121.68 yen Tuesday. The euro, which sank as low as $1.0270 
during trading, was quoted at $1.0330 late in the day, up from 
$1.0320 Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro, which has been steadily giving ground since its  
January launch, had been expected to rebound after the crisis in 
Kosovo was over. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11 countries using the euro are trying to meet strict  
economic guidelines required for forming an economic and monetary 
union. But their costs rose during the Yugoslavian crisis as 
immigrants reached their borders, regional commerce was disrupted 
and other economic structures were threatened. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the NATO air campaign ended, however, the euro continued  
to struggle. On Wednesday, it came close to its historic bottom of 
$1.0260, which was reached during trading June 7. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market is basically disappointed with the euro's  
disability to rally after the end of the end of the Kosovo 
conflict,'' said Anjum Sayyed, chief currency trader for the 
Buffalo, N.Y., branch of Manufacturers &AMP; Traders Trust Co. 
</P>
<P>
	But the euro rose somewhat Wednesday afternoon as U.S. blue-chip  
stocks fell for a third straight day, making the dollar ``look 
quite vulnerable,'' Sayyed said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, traders bought dollars and sold yen amid anticipation  
of additional Japanese intervention in currency markets. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong yen would hurt Japan's recovery from the worst  
recession in 50 years by making its exports less competitive. The 
Bank of Japan has intervened four times over a two week period, 
trying to keep the yen from strengthening against the dollar and 
the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	Sayyed estimated the bank has spent as much as $15 billion;  
other analysts estimate as much as $20 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Bank of Japan has been extremely aggressive. The size of  
these interventions has been massive,'' Sayyed said, and that ``has 
made traders nervous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That nervousness was reinforced Wednesday by statements by the  
Finance Ministry's influential vice minister for international 
affairs, Eisuke Sakakibara. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am closely watching both the dollar-yen and the euro-yen. If  
we think it is appropriate, we are ready to take decisive measures 
at any time,'' Sakakibara said. 
</P>
<P>
	Against other currencies, the dollar was quoted at 1.5469 Swiss  
francs, up from 1.5456, and 1.4716 Canadian dollars, up from 
1.4706. The British pound fell to $1.5795 from $1.5898. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on the euro's exchange rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8933 
German marks, down from 1.8952; 6.3500 French francs, down from 
6.3562; and 1,874.40 Italian lire, down from 1,876.23.

<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, N.M. (AP) -- Californians Dorothy Delasin and Natalie  
Gulbis shared medalist honors after Wednesday's second and final 
round of qualifying for the U.S. Women's Amateur Public Links 
Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The top 64 players from the two days of qualifying advanced to  
Thursday's opening round of match play competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Delasin, from Daly City, Calif., and Gulbis, from Citrus  
Heights, Calif., posted two-round scores of 147. That was five 
shots over par on the 6,453-yard, par-71 Santa Ana Golf Club 
course. Delasin and Gulbis both shot rounds of 74 and 73. 
</P>
<P>
	The Santa Ana course, with narrow fairways, big greens and high  
rough, proved extremely tough for the field of amateurs. 
</P>
<P>
	The trio of Summerset Lovett of Columbus, Ohio, Angela Stanford  
of Saginaw, Texas and Shannon Ingalls of Fallbrook, Calif., tied 
for third, all at 149. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those qualifying for match play were defending champion  
Amy Spooner-Johnson of Tallahassee, Fla., and two-time champion Jo 
Jo Robertson of Roswell, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson, who plans to turn pro this fall, is trying to become  
the first three-time winner of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Spooner-Johnson had rounds of 78 and 75 and Robertson qualified  
with rounds of 80 and 77. 
</P>
<P>
	Match play will include two rounds each on Thursday and Friday,  
with the semifinals on Saturday and the championship match on 
Sunday.

<HEADLINE>  Jury Deadlocked in R. Lewis Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The jury in the Reggie Lewis malpractice case told  
a judge Wednesday they had reached verdicts on two consultants in 
the case, but were deadlocked concerning the culpability of the 
lead physician. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury told Suffolk County Judge Thayer Fremont-Smith they  
could not decide whether Dr. Gilbert Mudge was negligent in the 
late Celtics star's death. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury did not disclose its decision regarding the two  
consultants, Drs. Mark Creager and Peter Friedman. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge sent the jurors home for the night and said he would  
re-instruct them Thursday morning. If they continued to be 
deadlocked on Mudge, the judge said, he would hear their decision 
on the consultants. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis' wife had sued Mudge and the consultants, claiming they  
misdiagnosed and mistreated her husband's fatal heart condition. A 
third consultant settled for an undisclosed sum before the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Her attorneys sought $75 million, saying that was the sum Lewis  
would have earned as a professional player. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis collapsed during a playoff game in April 1993 and was  
subsequently diagnosed with a life-threatening, potentially 
career-ending cardiac arrhythmia by a ``Dream Team'' of top doctors 
from New England Baptist Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lewises then turned to Mudge, of Brigham and Women's  
Hospital, who examined Lewis and announced at a news conference the 
player instead had a neurological condition that causes fainting 
spells. Mudge said he probably could return to professional 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	Two months later, on July 27, 1993, Lewis died practicing jump  
shots. He was 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Donna Harris-Lewis had suggested Mudge's judgment  
was clouded by his search for glory as the doctor who proved the 
``Dream Team'' wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	As testimony turned to alleged drug use by the popular athlete,  
Harris-Lewis' attorneys also suggested that Mudge, desperate to 
cover up his mistakes, was ``searching the gutters'' for 
alternative explanations for the death of his most famous patient. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge maintained that Lewis admitted to cocaine use two weeks  
before he died. He said the belated confession made an accurate 
diagnosis impossible and called several convicted felons to testify 
to alleged cocaine and marijuana use by Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge said Lewis also ignored orders not to exercise.  
</P>
<P>
	A third piece of Mudge's defense was that, despite the news  
conference in which he declared Lewis' heart healthy, he privately 
suspected the player might have a serious heart condition -- and was 
treating him with beta blockers that addressed both the fainting 
condition and the possible cardiac problem. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he told the family and the Celtics of his concerns, but  
both groups disputed that claim.

<HEADLINE> Asthma Inhalants Don't Help Smokers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The inhaled steroids that enable asthma patients to breathe  
easier won't do much to help people with lung disease from years of 
smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors had hypothesized that inhaled steroids might help such  
people because, like asthma patients, they suffer shortness of 
breath. 
</P>
<P>
	However, two studies in Thursday's New England Journal of  
Medicine found steroids to be of little help. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoking causes about 85 percent of all cases of chronic  
obstructive pulmonary disease, which is a combination of chronic 
bronchitis and emphysema. Nearly 16 million Americans suffer from 
the disease, according to the American Lung Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that  
more than 106,000 people died of the illness in 1996, making it the 
fourth leading cause of death in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tragedy of all of this is this is almost a wholly  
preventable disease. The real message is that people should not 
smoke,'' said Dr. Dennis E. Niewoehner of the Veterans Affairs 
Medical Center in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the studies, conducted by Niewoehner and colleagues at  
25 VA medical centers, 80 patients were given an inhaled steroid 
for eight weeks, 80 received steroids for two weeks and 111 
received a placebo. 
</P>
<P>
	In both groups that received treatment, the steroids were  
associated with shorter hospital stays and easier breathing at the 
beginning, but the benefits were no longer evident after six 
months, and the eight-week treatment was found to be no more 
effective than two weeks of treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	What's more, compared with patients who got the placebo, those  
who were treated with steroids were more likely to require 
treatment for hyperglycemia, an abnormally high level of sugar in 
the blood. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other study, from Dr. Romain A. Pauwels of University  
Hospital in Ghent, Belgium, and colleagues, an inhaled steroid was 
tested on patients who refused to stop smoking and suffered from a 
milder form of lung disease. The medicine was found to produce a 
one-time improvement in lung function, but it had no appreciable 
effect over the long term. 
</P>
<P>
	In an editorial, Dr. Homer A. Boushey of the University of  
California at San Francisco said the studies prove that 
inflammation in the airways in asthma patients is markedly 
different from that suffered by smokers.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft To Require Web Privacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Microsoft Corp., the world's biggest advertiser  
on the Internet, said Wednesday it will require the hundreds of Web 
sites where it buys ads to publish adequate assurances to protect 
consumers' privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, which spent more than $34 million last year on  
Internet advertising, said it will review privacy statements at 
those sites to ensure they meet guidelines developed by federal 
regulators. Analysts estimate companies together spent about $2 
billion last year on Web ads. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft announced the changes Wednesday at the PC Expo trade  
show. Bob Herbold, the company's chief operating officer, said 
ensuring that consumers believe their privacy is safe online is 
``critical to the success of the Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Today we are announcing some important steps to build people's  
confidence in the Internet as a global medium for communications 
and commerce,'' Herbold said. ``Still, we have a long way to go 
both as a company and as an industry to ensure that consumers who 
use the Internet feel their personal information is used in the way 
they want it used.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Herbold cited consumer polls showing the number of people buying  
items on the Internet is climbing more slowly than the industry 
expects, and other surveys indicating online privacy and security 
are top fears among consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Inadequate privacy protection is a top barrier to the  
continued growth of e-commerce,'' said Herbold, who personally buys 
mostly books, sweaters and hiking equipment over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's announcement comes as the Federal Trade Commission  
prepares recommendations to Congress on whether tough new federal 
privacy laws are needed to protect consumers online. Microsoft has 
lobbied with other industry groups against such legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry sources predict the FTC will recommend that lawmakers  
continue to let Internet companies regulate themselves. They cite a 
favorable survey last month, funded by the industry, showing that 
businesses have made dramatic improvements since last year in 
warning people how companies use personal information collected 
about them online. 
</P>
<P>
	That study showed nearly two-thirds of commercial sites  
displayed at least some warning they were collecting personal 
details from visitors. But less than 10 percent of those sites had 
what experts consider comprehensive privacy policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, which buys ads on more than 750 Web sites, said it  
will carefully review policies on sites where it buys ads to make 
sure they meet FTC guidelines -- telling customers that information 
is being collected; asking consumers for consent; giving consumers 
access to those details; making sure the data stays secure; and 
enforcing the company's promises. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's encouraging,'' said Jason Catlett of Junkbusters Corp.,  
a New Jersey-based privacy group that has harshly criticized 
Microsoft over Internet privacy issues. ``If it really is notice, 
consent and access, then that's very encouraging. The devil is in 
the details.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Catlett and other privacy advocates believe that Congress should  
approve new privacy laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need a strong enforcement mechanism that isn't voluntary  
for companies to submit themselves to,'' Catlett said. ``Otherwise, 
the worst actors won't volunteer, they won't take Microsoft 
advertising and they'll damage privacy for everyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Microsoft began offering Internet companies a  
free digital tool kit that promises to allow consumers to use 
next-generation software, called P3P, to restrict which personal 
details Web sites collect about them. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said it will make those tools more widely available on  
its network of Web sites, and Herbold said building P3P technology 
into future versions of Microsoft's popular Internet browser 
software ``deserves serious consideration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IBM, the second-largest advertiser on the Web, made a similar  
announcement earlier this year but made no provisions to check the 
details of privacy statements on Internet sites where it 
advertises. 
</P>
<P>
	The IBM requirement took effect June 1, and the company said  
Wednesday that fully 98 percent of the several hundred Web sites 
where it advertises now carry a privacy statement.

<HEADLINE> Sobrero Questionable After Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- After weeks of hearing how incredibly deep is the  
talent pool of the U.S. women's World Cup team, it might have to 
show it. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting defender Kate Sobrero is questionable for Thursday's  
game against Nigeria at Soldier Field after spraining her right 
ankle Wednesday during practice. Sobrero, who has started all but 
one game this season, had to be carried off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision on whether she'll play will be made after more  
treatment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope it's not as serious as to keep her out of the match,''  
coach Tony DiCicco said. ``Kate's been playing great and we hope 
she's able to go. If not, we've got a lot of options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sobrero was hurt when she and Joy Fawcett went up for a ball.  
There was no contact, but Sobrero landed awkwardly on the bumpy 
field and twisted her ankle. She was unable to put any weight on 
the foot. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a bit unfortunate it happened the day before the game  
because there's not much time to recover, but we're completely 
confident in the reserves,'' starting forward Cindy Parlow said. 
</P>
<P>
	While losing a starter is never ideal, DiCicco built his roster  
for a situation like this. In the days before he announced his 
World Cup roster, he tried to think of every possible problem that 
could arise and then come up with a contingency plan for it. Some 
of his final cuts came down simply to which positions had more 
depth. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiffany Roberts, Christie Pearce, Lorrie Fair or Sara Whalen are  
the likely replacements if Sobrero can't play. Another option is a 
return to the 3-4-3 formation that the United States used for many 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have options, based on the athleticism and speed of the  
Nigerians, that we can use,'' DiCicco said. ``If we need to, we'll 
certainly reach into our athletic players to help out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And going to the U.S. reserves isn't like looking down the bench  
and pointing to the gawky kid who's only one step above the water 
boy. This team has, for the most part, been together for years. 
They know each other's playing styles almost as well as they know 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
	Mia Hamm, Julie Foudy and Michelle Akers weren't on the field  
the entire time as the United States went 15-2-1 in pre-World Cup 
matches. The reserves got plenty of minutes, and everyone on the 
roster started at least one game this season. 
</P>
<P>
	If Sobrero can't play, they'll adjust, starting forward Tiffeny  
Milbrett said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You do lose a little bit of your rhythm, but everyone's played  
so many times together,'' Milbrett said. ``At any given time, I 
believe he (DiCicco) could take one player off and put another on 
and we'd be just as good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sobrero is the the first option. The 22-year-old from Notre Dame  
has turned into one of the team's biggest surprises since she was 
invited to training camp in January 1998. She quickly worked her 
way into the starting lineup, and despite being less experienced 
than the other starters -- she has 27 appearances with the national 
team while seven of the other 10 starters have more than 100 -- 
plays like a veteran. 
</P>
<P>
	In Saturday's 3-0 victory over Denmark, she had two impressive  
plays in front of the net, including one early in the game when it 
was still scoreless. One of the fastest players on the team, she 
excels at tracking down players who've managed to break free. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kate's been playing great and I'd feel badly if she's not able  
to play,'' DiCicco said. ``She deserves the chance to continue 
playing in the World Cup and establishing herself as one of the 
best defenders in the world. And I think she's well on her way to 
doing that.''

<HEADLINE> Packers Sign Return Star Howard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Desmond Howard, a Super Bowl MVP who  
disappointed fans when he bolted for the Oakland Raiders two years 
ago, has returned to the Green Bay Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel I'm returning to a contender, a great team,'' Howard  
said in a teleconference Wednesday after signing with the Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard, 29, who gained fame with the Packers as a kick and punt  
returner, agreed to terms on a multiyear contract with the Packers 
as a free agent. He was cut by Oakland June 9. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope Desmond can recreate the magic he created when he was  
with us in 1996,'' general manager Ron Wolf said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers did not release contract terms.  
</P>
<P>
	Howard left the Packers as a free agent after setting a return  
record and being named MVP in the Packers' 35-21 victory over the 
New England Patriots in the 1997 Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Heisman Trophy winner from Michigan, who set an NCAA  
record by catching at least one touchdown pass in 10 consecutive 
games, signed a four-year, $6 million deal with the Raiders in 
1997. At the time he said he hoped to get more playing time at 
receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	He never reached the level of play he did with the Packers.  
Howard was fifth among AFC punt returners with 45 returns for 541 
yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard attributed his lack of success in Oakland to the fact the  
Raiders were not a winning team. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't compare a Super Bowl-winning team to a 4-12 team,''  
Howard said. ``That's apples and oranges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Howard set a Green Bay record with 875 punt-return yards in  
1996. He also led the NFL with a 15.1-yard punt-return average and 
three punt returns for touchdowns. He also averaged 21 yards per 
kickoff return and caught 13 passes for 95 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Super Bowl, he had 244 return yards against the Patriots,  
including a record 99-yard kickoff return that clinched the 
Packers' first Super Bowl victory in 29 years. He also set a record 
with 90 punt-return yards, including a 32-yard return in the first 
quarter that set up the Packers' first score.

<HEADLINE>  Sports Agent Defends Allegations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Sports agent William ``Tank'' Black  
defended himself against allegations of impropriety on Wednesday, 
saying an investigation by the NFL Players Association was 
motivated by other agents jealous of his success. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been unfairly accused,'' Black said during a news  
conference. ``This is a flawed process, and I haven't broken any 
rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NFLPA is investigating whether Black made improper payments  
to Florida football players before their eligibility expired. The 
union could revoke his license if it finds him guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	Black showed a video in which such clients as San Diego Chargers  
linebacker Gerald Dixon and Toronto Raptors guard Vince Carter 
vouched for the agent's integrity. 
</P>
<P>
	Black said the investigation was motivated by the jealousy of  
other sports agents. His Professional Management Inc. has 40 
players and earns $10 million to $15 million a year. It offers 
players contract negotiations, personal management services, 
marketing and public relations and post-sports career planning. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the reasons these allegations were brought against us  
was because our competitors can't beat us,'' Black said. 
</P>
<P>
	Black filed a lawsuit Tuesday against the NFLPA, claiming the  
union is trying to destroy his Columbia, S.C.-based business by 
intimidating him, his clients and employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit seeks more than $10 million, the amount of business  
he believes he has lost due to the probe, and injunctive relief to 
stop the NFLPA investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the investigation began, Black has lost four clients,  
former Florida players Johnny Rutledge, Jevon Kearse, Reggie McGrew 
and Mike Peterson, who are the primary focus of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the rumors and allegations have worried other clients.  
</P>
<P>
	``Clients are concerned,'' Black said. ``I have to assure them  
that nothing is going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit could have implications for all sports agents  
dealing with the NFLPA and guarantee them due process if they are 
investigated by the union, Leonard Mungo, Black's lawyer, said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NFLPA is acting as judge, jury and prosecutor,'' Mungo  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Black has until July 5 to respond to the NFLPA complaint, which  
he hasn't done yet, he said, because the allegations are so vague. 
He called the investigation a witch hunt. 
</P>
<P>
	NFLPA lawyer Richard Berthelsen said Black is being treated no  
differently than 15 or so other agents who have been investigated 
by the union the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have time for witch hunts,'' Berthelsen said.  
``They've apparently chosen to make the media the forum for the 
issue instead of our internal arbitration procedures.''

defended himself against allegations of impropriety on Wednesday, 
saying an investigation by the NFL Players Association was 
motivated by other agents jealous of his success. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been unfairly accused,'' Black said during a news  
conference. ``This is a flawed process, and I haven't broken any 
rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NFLPA is investigating whether Black made improper payments  
to Florida football players before their eligibility expired. The 
union could revoke his license if it finds him guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	Black showed a video in which such clients as San Diego Chargers  
linebacker Gerald Dixon and Toronto Raptors guard Vince Carter 
vouched for the agent's integrity. 
</P>
<P>
	Black said the investigation was motivated by the jealousy of  
other sports agents. His Professional Management Inc. has 40 
players and earns $10 million to $15 million a year. It offers 
players contract negotiations, personal management services, 
marketing and public relations and post-sports career planning. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the reasons these allegations were brought against us  
was because our competitors can't beat us,'' Black said. 
</P>
<P>
	Black filed a lawsuit Tuesday against the NFLPA, claiming the  
union is trying to destroy his Columbia, S.C.-based business by 
intimidating him, his clients and employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit seeks more than $10 million, the amount of business  
he believes he has lost due to the probe, and injunctive relief to 
stop the NFLPA investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the investigation began, Black has lost four clients,  
former Florida players Johnny Rutledge, Jevon Kearse, Reggie McGrew 
and Mike Peterson, who are the primary focus of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the rumors and allegations have worried other clients.  
</P>
<P>
	``Clients are concerned,'' Black said. ``I have to assure them  
that nothing is going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit could have implications for all sports agents  
dealing with the NFLPA and guarantee them due process if they are 
investigated by the union, Leonard Mungo, Black's lawyer, said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NFLPA is acting as judge, jury and prosecutor,'' Mungo  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Black has until July 5 to respond to the NFLPA complaint, which  
he hasn't done yet, he said, because the allegations are so vague. 
He called the investigation a witch hunt. 
</P>
<P>
	NFLPA lawyer Richard Berthelsen said Black is being treated no  
differently than 15 or so other agents who have been investigated 
by the union the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have time for witch hunts,'' Berthelsen said.  
``They've apparently chosen to make the media the forum for the 
issue instead of our internal arbitration procedures.''

<HEADLINE> Teen Convicted in Ore. Slaying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRANTS PASS, Ore. (AP) -- A teen-ager was convicted Wednesday of  
helping his half-brother kill a popular lodge owner in a plot to 
steal the victim's sport-utility vehicle for a night on the town. 
</P>
<P>
	Josh Cain, 19, faces at least 25 years in prison for murder and  
unauthorized use of a motor vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors acknowledged Cain didn't pull the trigger, but said  
he provided the gun and helped 15-year-old half-brother Trevor 
Walraven hide the body in last summer's slaying of Bill Hull, owner 
of the Black Bar Lodge. 
</P>
<P>
	Walraven shot the man once in the top of the head with Cain's  
revolver, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Bob Abel said there was no physical evidence or  
conclusive testimony placing Cain on the remote logging road where 
Hull was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	He contended all of the evidence pointed at Walraven, and that  
Cain's participation was limited to joy riding in a sport-utility 
vehicle they found abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
	Walraven is to be tried separately.

<HEADLINE> Farmworkers Face Poisoning Risks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WATSONVILLE, Calif. (AP) -- Farmworker Isabel Rendon collapsed,  
dizzy and throwing up, in a strawberry field last year after 
pesticides drifted from a neighboring apple orchard. 
</P>
<P>
	But she also said she lives almost constantly with rashes on her  
hands and blisters on her arms, caused by constant exposure to 
toxic chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Rendon is apparently not alone. About 665 workers are  
poisoned each year in California's lush fields and orchards, 
according to a study released Wednesday by environmental and labor 
advocates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud to be a farmworker, but I do not believe I need to  
be poisoned at work in order to make a living,'' Ms. Rendon said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found that most workers receive little, if any,  
medical treatment when they are overexposed. 
</P>
<P>
	Rendon and ten coworkers poisoned last year were taken by a  
field supervisor to a local clinic where they were given water and 
Tylenol. Most doctors said they would recommend rest, monitoring 
and prescription antidotes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Medical treatment is very limited. I see birth impairments,  
neurological problems, rashes, blisters, cancer, and the life 
expectancy for farmworkers in this country is 49,'' said Dr. 
Roberto Letimendi, who works at a health clinic in Watsonville. ``I 
believe this is in direct relation to the chronic exposure by these 
farmworkers to pesticides.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Letimendi said the new study should be used to leverage funding  
for additional studies about the medical problems caused by 
pesticide exposure among California's 600,000 farmworkers. 
</P>
<P>
	The study analyzed 3,991 cases of occupational poisonings by  
agricultural pesticides between 1991 and 1996. Grapes, cotton and 
broccoli were the crops accounting for the most poisoning cases, 
according to the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Penalties for those poisonings were rare, the study found.  
During 1996 and 1997, more than 85 percent of the documented 
pesticide safety violations statewide carried no fines at all. 
</P>
<P>
	``Enforcement of California pesticide safety laws is clearly  
lacking,'' said Anne Katten of the California Rural Legal 
Assistance Foundation. ``Issuing warnings instead of fines for 
pesticide regulations is like the California Highway Patrol handing 
out 'please drive safely' letters to reckless drivers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	California Department of Pesticide Regulation spokeswoman Veda  
Federighi said the study and its sponsors -- the United Farm 
Workers, Pesticide Action Network, Californians for Pesticide 
Reform and the California Rural Legal Assistance Foundation -- 
overstated the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the situation is as dire as they want to paint  
it,'' she said. ``But we certainly are working to improve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Krauter, a spokesman for the California Farm Bureau  
Federation, said the study is unfair because it focuses on 
selective data between 1991 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``Farmers have a great regard for the health and safety of their  
workers,'' he said. Krauter added that California has the toughest 
pesticide regulations in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kate Hallward of United Farm Workers said those regulations  
don't mean much if most violators aren't penalized. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly not enough is being done,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The study's sponsors are recommending that state officials  
rapidly phase out the use of the most toxic pesticides and promote 
healthy and sustainable alternatives. In addition, they are calling 
for a ban on aerial spraying of pesticides and expanded buffer 
zones around recently treated areas.

<HEADLINE> Goldman Sachs Profit Beats Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the elite investment  
bank that went public last month, reported profits Wednesday that 
easily surpassed Wall Street's expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman posted net income of $340 million, or 71 cents a share,  
for the second fiscal quarter. Excluding one-time charges of $672 
million related to its public offering, Goldman made $624 million, 
or $1.30 a share, beating analysts' estimate of $1.07 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York-based company made $847 million in the second  
quarter last year, when it was still a private company, or $476 
million on a pro forma basis, which means earnings are stated as if 
the company had been publicly traded at that time. 
</P>
<P>
	``From almost any vantage point it appears this is a  
Goldman-type market,'' wrote Henry McVey, an analyst with Morgan 
Stanley Dean Witter, in a research note. He pointed to the 
company's robust trading revenues, big fees from advising on 
corporate takeovers, and strong underwriting for initial public 
stock offerings. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman's net revenues, which exclude interest expenses, were  
$3.47 billion for the three months ended May 28, up 16 percent from 
$2.99 billion in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	The company acted as an adviser on some of the largest corporate  
takeovers this year, including AT&AMP;T's acquisition of MediaOne, and 
BP Amoco's purchase of Arco. Fees from mergers and acquisitions 
totaled $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman posted profits of $1.35 billion, or $2.81 a share, for  
the first half of its fiscal year, down from $1.73 billion. On a 
pro forma basis, profits rose to $1.16 billion from $995 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Net revenues were $6.46 billion vs. $5.46 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Goldman's stock fell $3 to $65 on the New York Stock Exchange.  
Almost all of the brokerage companies saw their stocks fall 
Wednesday as investors sold aggressively on concerns the industry's 
earnings may have peaked for the year.

<HEADLINE> Europe: Dollar, Gold Advance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The U.S. dollar rose today against most major  
currencies in European trading, pushing the euro near its lowest 
level since it was launched in January. Gold prices edged up in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted at $1.0293 late in the day, down from  
$1.0322 Tuesday, but at midafternoon it had dropped to $1.0270 -- 
just shy of the record low of $1.0260 posted June 7. 
</P>
<P>
	``The euro pushed down when New York got going but then  
stabilized around the $1.0280 level,'' said Juergen Lindemann, a 
trader at IBJ Bank in London. He said weakness in the U.S. stock 
market was helping to curb the euro's decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Other dollar rates compared with late Tuesday included 122.00  
Japanese yen, up from 121.73; 1.5504 Swiss francs, up from 1.5438, 
and 1.4723 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4707. The British pound was 
quoted at $1.5783, down from $1.5907. 
</P>
<P>
	At midday in New York, the dollar was quoted at 121.89 Japanese  
yen and 1.5472 Swiss francs. The euro was quoted at $1.0310 and the 
pound was trading at $1.5782 at midday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately, though they remain in use. Based on euro 
rates in Europe, the dollar was worth 1.9002 German marks, up from 
1.8948; 6.3728 French francs, up from 6.3549; 2.1410 Dutch 
guilders, up from 2.1350, and 1,881.15 Italian lire, up from 
1,875.87. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold closed in London at $258.70 per troy ounce, up from $258.55  
on Tuesday. In Zurich gold rose to $258.65 from $258.55. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold fell 10 cents in Hong Kong to close at $258.95.  
</P>
<P>
	Silver closed in London at $5.05 per troy ounce, up from $5.00.

<HEADLINE> More Belgian Foods Barred From U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government expanded the list of imported  
foods from Belgium that U.S. Customs will seize at the border: No 
milk-containing foods, from cheese to soups, can enter the country 
without special safety testing. 
</P>
<P>
	Belgian beef, poultry, pork and byproducts were banned by most  
nations, including the United States, this month after it was 
discovered that large quantities had been contaminated by 
cancer-causing dioxin. The contamination apparently was caused by 
dioxin-laced animal feed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration last week ordered detention of  
egg-containing products from Belgium, France and the Netherlands, 
as well as animal feed, pet food and animal feed ingredients from 
anywhere in Europe because of the contamination. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the FDA added milk-containing foods from Belgium  
to the list of imports that cannot enter the country unless 
laboratory testing proves they are free of dioxin or other 
carcinogens known as PCBs. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA termed the move precautionary, calling it unlikely that  
U.S. consumers were exposed to harmful chemical levels.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton May Be Hubbell Witness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a move that could complicate the first  
lady's political aspirations, prosecutor Kenneth Starr has named 
Hillary Rodham Clinton as a potential witness for the trial of 
former law partner Webster Hubbell, legal sources said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The independent counsel's office submitted Mrs. Clinton's name  
April 21 as one of 63 potential witnesses in the Hubbell case, said 
the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Hubbell's lawyers 
countered with a list of 17 possible defense witnesses May 25. The 
defense filed both lists under seal in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	At a hearing Wednesday, U.S. District Judge James Robertson  
estimated the trial -- scheduled to begin Aug. 9 -- would last five 
weeks at most. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton is pondering a race for the Senate seat from New  
York. 
</P>
<P>
	If Starr calls her to the witness stand, it would be her second  
appearance to testify at the federal courthouse in Washington. Her 
first was before a grand jury in January 1996, amid a furor over 
the discovery of her law firm billing records that revealed the 
work she and Hubbell had done on a fraudulent Arkansas real estate 
development called Castle Grande. 
</P>
<P>
	The billing records turned up in the White House family  
residence under still-unexplained circumstances in early January 
1996, two years after prosecutors subpoenaed them. The fingerprints 
of Mrs. Clinton, Hubbell and former Rose partner Vincent Foster 
were on them. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15-count felony indictment against Hubbell stemming from the  
emergence of the billing records mentions Mrs. Clinton three dozen 
times. Hubbell, a former associate attorney general in the Clinton 
administration, is charged with concealing his and Mrs. Clinton's 
legal work on Castle Grande. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1,050-acre project -- which federal banking regulators  
concluded was riddled with ``insider dealing, fictitious sales and 
land flips'' -- was owned by Hubbell's father-in-law, Seth Ward, and 
Mrs. Clinton's Whitewater business partner, Jim McDougal. Federal 
regulators concluded that Castle Grande transactions cost 
McDougal's savings and loan nearly $4 million, contributing to the 
institution's failure. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton ``will be like most of the witnesses prosecutors  
have to call in public corruption cases, trying to prove their case 
with testimony from colleagues and confidants and friends who 
aren't happy to be government witnesses,'' said former Iran-Contra 
prosecutor John Barrett, who now teaches at St. John's University. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr spokeswoman Elizabeth Ray declined to comment. Clinton  
lawyer David Kendall wasn't immediately available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless there's a smoking gun in her testimony, I don't think  
it's going to have much impact at all'' on a Senate race, said 
Democratic strategist Gary Nordlinger. 
</P>
<P>
	Any testimony she gives at Hubbell's trial ``won't be televised  
so she won't have that video image in people's minds; it's far 
enough ahead of the election; and both Clintons are the most 
investigated people in the world. The American public has already 
formed an opinion on Bill and Hillary,'' said Nordlinger. 
</P>
<P>
	The billing records revealed that Mrs. Clinton drafted a real  
estate option that pegged the price of a 22-acre slice of Castle 
Grande at $400,000. The government, which ended up owning the 
property when the S&AMP;L collapsed, got $38,000 for the parcel. 
</P>
<P>
	The inspector general at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.  
concluded that McDougal's S&AMP;L used the option prepared by Mrs. 
Clinton to deceive federal bank examiners about the payment of 
hundreds of thousands of dollars in real estate commissions to 
Ward. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton told federal regulators 55 times in a 1996  
interview that she didn't recall various aspects of the work she 
and her law firm did on Castle Grande -- including authorizing the 
destruction of her warehoused law firm files on the project. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, her testimony may be valuable to Starr.  
</P>
<P>
	``Prosecutors may need her to authenticate some of the Rose Law  
Firm records, things she actually authored, and she's the witness 
and they need to put it in evidence,'' said Barrett. ``She knows 
how the firm worked, how Hubbell worked, what his day-to-day 
lawyering was like and she certainly does have some recollection.''

<HEADLINE> Ball Hits Umpire Davis Near Eye </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- First base umpire Gerry Davis missed 1 1-2  
innings of Wednesday night's Cardinals-Astros game after being 
struck by a ball near his left eye on a freak play. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis appeared well out of the line of fire when catcher Tony  
Eusebio threw to first on Edgar Renteria's bunt. But the ball 
deflected off Renteria's arm and hit the unsuspecting umpire, who 
had the presence of mind to grab his hat before it could hit the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
	After a brief delay, the game continued with a three-man crew.  
Davis was back at his point at the top of the sixth, apparently 
after receiving a few stitches.

<HEADLINE> Asian Woes Trouble Some Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- At Bob Smith's Al Fresco Patio Outlet,  
economic upheavals in Asia have been a big boon for homeowners, who 
can buy outdoor furniture for half of what it used to cost. 
</P>
<P>
	Low-cost Asian goods have pushed down the price for tables, lawn  
chairs and umbrellas. But Smith isn't celebrating the windfall that 
Asia's crisis brought to the U.S. marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's costs for merchandise have dropped as a result of cheap  
imports, but he must discount his retail prices to remain 
competitive. As a result, he must sell twice as much furniture just 
to stay even. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American public says: 'That's great. I can buy that  
umbrella for 300 bucks instead of 600 bucks.' But they don't see 
the downside,'' said Smith. ``I can only sell so many umbrellas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His problem illustrates the mixed legacy of the economic crisis  
that began two years ago. American consumers are saving money by 
buying imports, and as they've been spending, the U.S. economy has 
continued to grow. But for businesses ranging from Smith's small 
retail outlet to big multinational corporations like Motorola, 
Boeing and Atlantic Richfield, Asia's downfall has meant a drop in 
sales and profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturers and dealers in commodities like oil and grain have  
struggled to cope with lost Asian customers and competition from 
lower-priced imports. Last year, American manufacturers laid off 
more than 250,000 workers and canceled expansion plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Silicon Valley has also suffered. The computer chip maker  
National Semiconductor cut 1,400 jobs and forced employees to take 
10 days unpaid vacation. Competitor Intel reduced its payroll by 
3,000 people last year, its biggest job cuts in more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``The impact has been mixed,'' said Cynthia Latta, principal  
U.S. economist for Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI. ``Of course, it hasn't 
been good for people who have lost jobs. For the average consumer, 
it's been pretty much all good. We've certainly had a pretty good 
party because of problems in the rest of the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Americans have paid less for cars, gasoline, televisions,  
computers, toys and other products, and purchased homes at low 
interest rates. By helping keep world inflation in check and 
consumer spending high, the crisis has had the effect of a booster 
shot on the United States' long economic expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	The crisis also has created opportunities for some businesses.  
Japan, Korea and other Asian countries have been forced to change 
laws to allow foreign firms to buy domestic real estate and 
corporations. That has enabled American companies to buy buildings 
and take over struggling Asian firms at bargain prices, said Jay 
Nelson, senior editor of the executive newsletter Success Stories: 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only in recession has it forced them to do American-style  
restructuring, and this has created a real opportunity,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks in part to cost cutting, some big manufacturers such as  
Boeing and Motorola have begun to recover from losses attributed to 
the Asian crisis. Their overseas markets, however, have yet to 
fully bounce back. 
</P>
<P>
	``The impact is going to be still with us for a long time in  
terms of decreased exports and increased imports,'' said Greg 
Mastel, an Asia analyst with the Economic Strategy Institute in 
Washington. ``I doubt you're going to see a whole lot of companies 
like Boeing selling airplanes to these countries for two or three 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Asian crisis has meant more business for Milton Philipson, a  
consultant to small wholesalers who import televisions, telephones 
and other consumer electronics from Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Philipson, president and chief executive of Domestic and  
International Electronics Group in Culver City, said the recession 
has created a flood of cheap consumer electronics from Asian 
companies trying to stave off bankruptcy by selling in U.S. and 
European markets. 
</P>
<P>
	For retailers and importers, it has created a dilemma similar to  
Smith, the furniture store owner. Prices are so low and competition 
so intense that profit margins have nearly disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the one end, it's a very healthy situation, but on the  
other end, it's creating profit havoc for the companies,'' 
Philipson said. ``Profits are the big problem.''

<HEADLINE> Golfers Look Forward to Westchester  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARRISON, N.Y. (AP) -- This time, Westchester Country Club is  
nothing like the layout last week for the U.S. Open. Some of the 
favorites in the Buick Classic are hopeful their results aren't the 
same, either. 
</P>
<P>
	David Duval was ``bewildered'' by his 75s Saturday and Sunday  
that dropped him from a share of the lead in the U.S. Open to a tie 
for seventh. Vijay Singh, who tied for third, was still talking 
about good shots that went unrewarded at Pinehurst No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought this Open was my tournament to win,'' Singh said.  
</P>
<P>
	And Ernie Els just wanted to forget his entire experience. He  
had rounds of 72 and 76 and missed the cut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I was kind of overanxious to make a good shot, instead of  
letting the golf course take care of my golf game,'' he said. ``I 
tried to push things where I shouldn't have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All three golfers say they are eager to make amends starting  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Westchester has often been compared to a U.S. Open-style course  
because of its tree-lined fairways, thick rough and slick greens. 
Pinehurst No. 2 was anything but that, with marginal rough 
compensated for with the treacherous, domed greens of Donald Ross. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the difficulty of Pinehurst No. 2 -- Payne Stewart was  
the only player under par -- and the grinding atmosphere of the U.S. 
Open, Duval said he was surprised at how ready he is to play the 
Buick Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Masters, in which he also had a chance on Sunday  
before losing strokes on the back nine, Duval missed the cut and 
withdrew from another tournament saying he was emotionally drained. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to come and play here because I do like it,'' he  
said. ``But I didn't really expect to be as eager to play as I am. 
I thought I would be a little more worn out. I seemed to have 
gotten past that pretty quick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Usually, the tournament is scheduled the week before the U.S.  
Open and is popular as an Open tuneup by many players. 
</P>
<P>
	One week after the Open this year, the tournament managed to  
attract only four of the top 10 money winners (Duval, Jeff Maggert, 
Singh and Steve Pate). Other tops names competing here are Fred 
Couples, Steve Elkington, Lee Janzen, Tom Lehman and Justin 
Leonard. 
</P>
<P>
	Els was a back-to-back, wire-to-wire winner in the 1996 and 1997  
Buick Classics but was forced to withdraw on his ninth hole in last 
year's first round because of a bad back. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he finally got over the injury late last year.  
</P>
<P>
	Until last year, Els had been sensational in this tournament. In  
addition to winning twice, he finished tied for fourth in 1995 and 
was second to Janzen in 1994. In 16 career rounds here, he has been 
over par only once. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't explain it,'' Els said. ``All I can say is I like  
playing here. I like the way it sets up. You've got to hit fairways 
and greens and you have got to putt well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	J.P. Hayes is the defending champion. He beat Furyk on the first  
playoff hole in last year's rain-plagued tournament which was 
shortened to 54 holes. 
</P>
<P>
 *DIVOTS:* Total price money has increased from $1.8 million to $2.5  
million and first-prize from $324,000 to $450,000. ... Duval, Bob 
Tway, Mike Hulbert and Doug Martin took batting practice at Shea 
Stadium prior to Tuesday night's Marlins-Mets game. Several players 
asked Duval for his autograph and about playing in the U.S. Open. 
``I was telling them it was like trying to stop a six-iron right 
there on the pitching mound,'' Duval said of Pinehurst's domed 
greens. ... Joel Kribel, a four-time collegiate All-America at 
Stanford, makes his pro debut this week.

<HEADLINE> Hack Wilson Gets Another RBI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hack Wilson keeps driving in runs, 51 years  
after his death and 69 years after his remarkable 1930 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson's single-season mark for RBIs was increased to 191  
Tuesday by the commissioner's office, which also gave Babe Ruth six 
additional walks, raising his career-record total to 2,062. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no doubt that Hack Wilson's RBI total should be  
191,'' commissioner Bud Selig said. ``I am sensitive to the 
historical significance that accompanies the correction of such a 
prestigious record, especially after so many years have passed, but 
it is important to get it right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Recently retired Chicago Tribune baseball writer Jerome  
Holtzman, now baseball's historian, examined box scores and 
play-by-play accounts of each game of Wilson's record-setting 
season for the Chicago Cubs in 1930. Seymour Siwoff and Steve Hirdt 
of the Elias Sports Bureau, baseball's statisticians, and Rich 
Levin of the commissioner's office also reviewed Wilson's totals. 
</P>
<P>
	They said the missing RBI came from the second game of a  
doubleheader between Wilson's Chicago Cubs and the Cincinnati Reds 
on July 28, 1930. 
</P>
<P>
	National League records credited Charlie Grimm of the Cubs with  
two RBIs in the game and Wilson with none. The Associated Press box 
score and accounts in the Chicago Tribune, Chicago Daily News, 
Chicago Daily Times and Chicago Herald-Examiner said Wilson drove a 
run with a third-inning single that scored Kiki Cuyler. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not the kind of people who like to make changes,''  
Siwoff said, ``but this was obvious. There was no way not to change 
it because all the evidence was there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The closest anyone has come to Wilson's record was when Lou  
Gehrig had 184 RBIs the following year. Cleveland's Manny Ramirez 
began Tuesday with 79 RBIs, on pace to drive in 203 runs. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruth's walks total is now 2,062. Ted Williams is second,  
trailing by 43, and Rickey Henderson of the New York Mets was third 
going into Tuesday night's game, 134 behind Ruth.

<HEADLINE> Court Limits Class-Action Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court reined in corporations'  
ability to reach massive settlements of lawsuits such as those over 
breast implants and other allegedly dangerous products, throwing 
out a $1.5 billion asbestos agreement today. 
</P>
<P>
	The 7-2 decision on the 1998-1999 term's last day, which drew  
praise from trial lawyers, set strict standards before courts can 
approve settlements that apply on a mandatory basis to all 
potential plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the rules do not apply to non-mandatory agreements  
where people have the right to opt out and file their own separate 
claim. 
</P>
<P>
	``This decision is very bad for any corporation that has injured  
lots of people and is attempting to cap its liability without 
paying fair compensation to its victims,'' said Arthur H. Bryant of 
the Trial Lawyers for Public Justice. ``It is an enormous victory 
for all consumers in America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The justices ruled that a federal judge in Texas wrongly  
approved a $1.5 billion settlement among Dallas-based Fibreboard, 
its insurers and about 186,000 people with asbestos-related health 
claims. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also upheld the 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Fibreboard, a subsidiary of Owens Corning, makes vinyl siding  
and other building materials that once contained asbestos, which 
has been linked to severe and sometimes deadly respiratory 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling is a follow-up to a 1997 Supreme Court decision in a  
separate case that also made it harder to reach nationwide 
settlements in product-liability lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens Corning general counsel Maura Abeln said the company has  
been working on a backup plan to reach agreements on the Fibreboard 
claims as part of Owens Corning's own nationwide settlement plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice David H. Souter's opinion for the court said the massive  
litigation over asbestos ``defies customary judicial administration 
and calls for national legislation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Coalition for Asbestos Resolution, a business organization,  
is supporting legislation in Congress to set up an administrative 
plan to resolve asbestos claims without going to court, said its 
leader, Conrad Mallet. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe, who argued for people  
challenging the Fibreboard settlement, said the ruling means 
companies cannot negotiate massive settlements with lawyers 
representing only some potential plaintiffs, and that the two sides 
cannot agree to limit the amount of money available for payment. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribe said most major class-action settlements thus far have  
been the type that let people opt out and file their own claim. But 
he said that if the Supreme Court had ruled for Fibreboard, more 
companies may have tried to arrange mandatory deals. 
</P>
<P>
	Souter's opinion said the federal judge who approved the  
Fibreboard settlement should have assessed on his own how much 
money the company had for payment, instead of relying on the 
company's agreement with the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fibreboard agreement let the company keep nearly all of its  
net worth, he noted, adding: ``It hardly appears that such a regime 
is the best that can be provided for class members.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Souter said some plaintiffs' lawyers represented  
people with different types of claims. The resulting conflicts of 
interest gave them ``great incentive to reach any agreement'' the 
court might approve, ``rather than the best possible arrangement'' 
for some class members, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Souter's opinion were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist  
and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. 
Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. 
</P>
<P>
	Dissenting were Justices Stephen G. Breyer and John Paul  
Stevens. Breyer wrote for the two that in complicated cases such as 
asbestos claims, ``our court should allow a district court full 
authority to exercise every bit of discretionary power that the law 
provides.''

<HEADLINE> Rite Aid, drugstore.com Make Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rite Aid Corp. is accelerating its efforts to  
sell pharmaceuticals online by buying a 25 percent stake in 
drugstore.com, the leading pharmacy on the Internet today. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal announced Tuesday, the nation's third-largest  
drugstore chain will spend $7.6 million for its stake. The alliance 
will allow shoppers to buy prescription drugs online for delivery 
by mail or for same-day pickup at any of the 3,800 Rite Aid stores 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is also a big boost to drugstore.com's business because  
it will be the only online pharmacy that will have access to the 
more than 50 million consumers whose prescription drug benefits are 
managed by Rite Aid. 
</P>
<P>
	``This gives drugstore.com something that none of their  
competition has and that is huge for them,'' said David Restrepo, a 
healthcare analyst at Internet research firm Jupiter 
Communications. ``This puts them well in the lead of everyone else 
trying to sell prescription drugs online.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid's investment in the privately held drugstore.com comes  
just a month after rival CVS Corp. purchased online pharmacy 
Soma.com for $30 million. Both CVS, the second-largest drugstore 
chain in the United States, and Rite Aid were looking for quick 
ways to jump start their presence on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Many traditional drugstore chains see huge growth potential  
online as consumers look for more convenient ways to buy 
prescriptions, especially for those medications they don't need 
immediately -- like birth control or heart drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Americans bought $13.8 billion worth of prescription  
drugs through the mail, representing about 13.4 percent of the $102 
billion in total prescription sales, according to the National 
Association of Chain Drugstores. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the best-known Internet and traditional retailers are  
betting that the online drug market will take off. Amazon.com 
purchased a 46 percent stake in drugstore.com in February while the 
Pittsburgh-based General Nutrition Companies, a vitamin, mineral 
supplement and natural food merchant, announced Tuesday that it was 
buying an 8 percent stake. 
</P>
<P>
	``This segment of the Internet world is just starting to heat  
up,'' Restrepo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Tuesday's alliance, drugstore.com will become the  
exclusive Internet pharmacy for Rite Aid. Customers who visit Rite 
Aid's Web site will be directed to drugstore.com to place any 
orders. Presently, Rite Aid only provides refills online. 
</P>
<P>
	``This gives us access to a very low-cost capital investment in  
terms of Internet development that we otherwise would not be able 
to tap into alone,'' said Martin Grass, chairman and chief 
executive of the Camp Hill, Pa.-based Rite Aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Drugstore.com, which launched in late February, also said it  
will begin to rely more on Rite Aid to fill its prescription 
orders. It presently has a fulfillment contract with mail-order 
company RxAmerica. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's deal gives drugstore.com exclusive access to the  
millions of members affiliated with PCS Health Systems Inc., one of 
the nation's biggest pharmacy benefit managers bought by Rite Aid 
last November. 
</P>
<P>
	PBMs decide what medicines insurance plans will pay for --  
compiling lists called formularies -- and encourage doctors to 
prescribe only those drugs. One of the biggest challenges that 
online pharmacies have come up against have been securing 
agreements with PBMs. 
</P>
<P>
	Other companies are also lining up exclusive deals to tap into  
this lucrative market. YourPharmacy.com, a new site that is slated 
to launch by the end of the month, will be the only Internet 
drugstore offering prescriptions to the 47 million consumers 
affiliated with Express Scripts Inc., a PBM based in St. Louis. 
YourPharmacy.com is a subsidiary of Express Scripts. 
</P>
<P>
	Both GNC, which is spending $2.4 billion for its stake, and Rite  
Aid will offer links to a revamped drugstore.com site, which is 
expected to be launched this fall. GNC already has an agreement 
with Rite Aid to develop a line of co-branded products, which will 
be sold on drugstore.com. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliances still need federal regulatory approval and are  
expected to close some time this summer.

<P>
	Two 13-year-olds will get a chance to become instant  
millionaires on Thursday during the United States vs. Nigeria game. 
Crystal Juarez of Chicago and Werner Ramirez of Long Beach, Calif., 
will try to kick a ball through a designated target at halftime of 
the game. If they succeed, they will get $1 million each. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if they miss the target, the 13-year-olds will still take  
home at least $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
	To help the kids shoot Alexi Lasas, two-time member of the  
United States men's World Cup team and a player for the MLS Kansas 
City Wizards, will be their mentor and on-field supporter. 
</P>
<P>
	The promotion is sponsored by Allstate Insurance Company, which  
will match the winnings of Juarez and Ramirez with a donation to 
the National Alliance of Youth Sports. 
</P>
<P>
	The finalists were selected at random from 1,300 entries. Kids  
between 10 and 14 could enter the contest at local soccer 
tournaments and professional soccer games in World Cup cities or

	 *BROKEN NOSE:* Denmark forward Karina Christensen is exiting the  
World Cup with a severely broken nose. 
</P>
<P>
	During a training session Wednesday, Christensen was  
accidentally hit in the face by defender Ulla Knudsen's elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	The team's physician, Mogens Kreutzfeldt, ordered X-rays taken  
of Christensen's nose and then told her to go home. She is to 
return to Denmark within the next five days. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, coach Joergen Hvidmose said Christensen's  
departure was ``a great loss for the team,'' and she had been 
``among Denmark's top players in the last three matches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite the accident, I remain optimistic regarding Denmark's  
chances in the two upcoming games against North Korea and 
Nigeria,'' Hvidmose said. 
</P>
<P>

really play soccer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The game of soccer is not very popular for women,'' said Wen.  
``The activity for most girls is dancing and playing the piano.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Memunatu Sulemana, the goalkeeper for Ghana's Black Queens, said  
her grandmother had misgivings about the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``My grandmother didn't like me playing (soccer),'' she said.  
``She said that it is a man's game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fortunately for Sulemana, her grandmother has accepted her  
soccer career, but she still worries. 
</P>
<P>
	``She hopes I stay healthy,'' said Sulemana.

	 *RFK SNUB:* For years, RFK Stadium in Washington was considered  
the unofficial home field of American soccer. When the stadium 
wasn't awarded the championship match of the Women's World Cup, the 
locals felt snubbed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt Washington deserved the final,'' stadium manager Jim  
Dalrymple said. ``To us, it made no sense to take those other 
games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So RFK, a venue for the 1994 men's World Cup and host for  
numerous other international matches, pulled out of the tournament. 
Another Washington-area venue, Jack Kent Cooke Stadium in Landover, 
Md., was awarded three first- and second-round doubleheaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike RFK, Cooke Stadium had never staged a soccer game before  
Wednesday night's first-round doubleheader. Also, RFK's wide field 
and partially enclosed design make it a perfect venue for soccer, 
while Cooke Stadium's surface is just barely wide enough to hold an 
official-sized field. Its plain, open structure with 80,000 seats 
usually requires at least 60,000 people to create any kind of 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	Women's World Cup organizers say they didn't offer the  
championship game to RFK because it isn't big enough to hold the 
record crowds they began projecting following the huge turnouts for 
the medal games of the 1996 Olympics. RFK has about 55,000 seats, 
while the Rose Bowl, host of the July 10 final, holds 86,000. The 
Rose Bowl also was the site of the 1994 World Cup final.

usually requires at least 60,000 people to create any kind of 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	Women's World Cup organizers say they didn't offer the  
championship game to RFK because it isn't big enough to hold the 
record crowds they began projecting following the huge turnouts for 
the medal games of the 1996 Olympics. RFK has about 55,000 seats, 
while the Rose Bowl, host of the July 10 final, holds 86,000. The 
Rose Bowl also was the site of the 1994 World Cup final.

<HEADLINE> Graf Escapes Against De Swardt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Steffi Graf is usually at home on  
Wimbledon's Centre Court. Not on Wednesday -- at least not right 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like a spectator in the beginning,'' she said as she  
fell behind the thumping serve of Mariaan De Swardt 5-1 in the 
first set, only to rally for a 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 victory in their 
second-round match. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way she was serving, there wasn't very much I could do.''  
On one point Graf described the way she ``rolled her eyes'' when 
the powerful South African skipped a 116 mph serve past her. 
</P>
<P>
	Top-seeded Martina Hingis was beaten Tuesday by 16-year-old  
Jelena Dokic. Twenty-four hours later, it was No. 2 Graf threatened 
by a troublesome South African. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf knew what to expect. They'd split two previous matches,  
with Graf calling De Swardt's victory four years ago ``the best 
that a woman ever played against me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graf turned the match as her serving improved and De Swardt's  
slipped. ``I guess experience helps a lot ... and trying to hang in 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even when Hingis was around, Graf was at least the sentimental  
favorite, and probably the logical choice after winning their 
emotional French Open final. Without her, she's the outright pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf covered her eyes at that suggestion and then cracked a  
smile. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know what, that is funny,'' she said. ``You always ask  
about the finals and I just won my second round. I'm not having an 
easy road here. Today's match was very tough ... and I'm refusing 
to look beyond that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Wimbledon is the biggest tournament around and the one that I  
enjoy the most. If I win it or not, it's nothing I worry right now 
about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graf's next match in with unseeded American Corina Morariu. Graf  
was pushed to three sets to beat her nine months ago in the U.S. 
Open when Graf was nursing a wrist injury. ``I wasn't worried about 
the wrist in the match, it's more the way she was playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And next up would probably be 18-year-old Russian Anna  
Kournikova. 
</P>
<P>
	At 30, with 22 Grand Slam singles titles including seven at  
Wimbledon, Graf knows any match on Centre Court could be her last. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a great feeling to walk on the court, the crowd  
cheering,'' she said. ``And when it was over. ``I didn't want to 
go. I have always said how special it is and today I didn't feel 
any different.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Seeking Help for Iowa Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate George W.  
Bush is asking business lobbyists to help him win the Iowa straw 
poll in August, according to an internal memo criticized by his GOP 
rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	The memo suggests that the Texas governor is making an all-out  
push to win the early test of campaign strength in Ames, Iowa, and 
it underscores that Bush brings enormous political resources to the 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
	A self-styled political outsider, Bush is turning to  
Washington's lobbying elite for help to cement his front-runner 
status. 
</P>
<P>
	In the memo, Iowa organizer Sarah Taylor says the campaign's  
goal is to ``organize through supportive Washington trade 
associations-companies to mobilize and turn out 700 Iowans who 
would probably not otherwise attend the straw poll on August 
14th.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She asks supporters to identify ``friendly national  
organizations'' and to convince 50 of them to turn out 15 Iowans 
each to the straw poll. ``In some cases, companies will be able to 
fill a bus, thus allowing for fewer trade associations that need to 
be worked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The memo was obtained by The Associated Press on Wednesday and  
confirmed as authentic by the Bush campaign, which said it was 
mailed Tuesday. Soliciting interests groups for help to organize 
Iowa is not unusual, but the scope of Bush's plans are another sign 
of his political strength and eagerness to dominate the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are late in arriving to the field and we're trying to  
mobilize our resources,'' Bush spokesman Dave Beckwith said. ``I 
can't imagine if you're working seriously at winning you wouldn't 
try to use every resource to get out supporters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Bush far ahead in polls, money-raising and endorsements,  
the memo provided his GOP foes ammunition to portray him as a 
political insider. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just another clear indication of how tied to the  
Washington lobbying and establishment crowd Mr. Bush is,'' said 
Bill Dal Col, campaign manager for Steve Forbes. ``He is now 
demonstrating that he will accomplish nothing if elected because he 
will be bought, sold and owned by the lobbyists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just using Iowans to recruit Iowans,'' said Brian  
Kennedy, political director for Lamar Alexander. ``He's the 
candidate of Washington, and he's using a lot of outside interest 
groups to come into Iowa and support him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The large field of Bush rivals are increasingly worried about  
slowing down his head of steam. A respected Iowa-based consultant 
allied with a rival campaign, speaking on condition of anonymity, 
said the non-Bush campaigns are working together to fashion similar 
messages that raise expectations for a Bush victory in Ames. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush advisers have been trying to play down his chances for  
victory, a task made harder by the revelation of the memo. 
</P>
<P>
	The memo refers to an attached list of trade associations that  
might help Bush. It is a Who's Who in lobbying circles, including 
the likes of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Mining 
Association, the Association of Builders and Contractors and Union 
Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	Peggy Ellis, director of congressional affairs at the Republican  
National Committee, is on the list -- though RNC officials are 
supposed to be neutral in GOP primaries. Ellis said she was never 
contacted by the Bush campaign about the Iowa effort. Beckwith said 
her name was crossed out in a final draft of the memo, along with 
nine others who could not help the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The list is labeled ``Incumbent Retention Business Members.''  
Beckwith said it came from the Republican House campaign committee 
and was used as a starting point for contacting potential 
organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for the committee was trying to determine whether  
the list came from her organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Dal Col said the list suggests that the Republican Party is  
violating its pledge to be neutral. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Beckwith: ``Governor Bush has friends all over the country  
and is proud of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The help of trade associations would be treated as an in-kind  
contribution under federal laws, which limit such donations to 
$5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Providing a rare window into the inner workings of a campaign,  
the memo says the 50 trade groups should be identified by July 9. 
``That would give us four weeks to work them and gather names, 
addresses and phone numbers of those who are attending. Our goal 
will be to have 700 names by Friday, Aug. 6. This will give us one 
week to focus on turnout,'' the Taylor memo says. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our only regret about this leaking out,'' Beckwith said with a  
sigh, ``is that is may give the other campaigns ideas.''

<HEADLINE> 31 Injured in England Train Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- An express train bound for Scotland collided with  
an empty commuter train Wednesday in northwest England, injuring 31 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of those taken to hospitals were not seriously injured, and  
all but five were able to leave after treatment, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both trains were headed north, but the empty First North Western  
passenger train was not moving when it was hit by the Virgin West 
Coast express on its way from London to Glasgow, investigators 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Four air ambulances were sent to the scene just south of  
Winsford, 155 miles northwest of London, but paramedics had to wait 
to remove the injured because power to the electrified rail line 
had not been switched off. 
</P>
<P>
	Four cars of the Virgin train, which travels on the route at  
speeds of up to 110 mph, were derailed but remained upright. The 
locomotive was turned on its side next to the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Green, chief executive of Virgin Trains, said the driver  
of the express locomotive ``immediately took every course of 
emergency action to bring the train to a stop as safely as 
possible, preventing far more serious injuries to passengers and 
crew alike.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators could not immediately determine the cause of the  
morning collision. 
</P>
<P>
	``Inspectors will be examining the trains, the track and signals  
and will look to see if there have been any breaches of health and 
safety law,'' said Bob Smallwood, deputy chief inspector of 
railways for Britain's Health and Safety Executive.

<HEADLINE>  European Ministers Visit Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- West European foreign and defense  
ministers got a first-hand look today at the gritty realities of 
postwar Kosovo, including a town still gripped by ethnic tension 
and the site of one of the worst alleged atrocities. 
</P>
<P>
	According to locals, several dozen ethnic Albanian men were  
herded into farm buildings near Velika Krusa in southwestern Kosovo 
and shot, then the buildings were set ablaze. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is appalling. I'm deeply distressed and moved by it,''  
British Foreign Minister Robin Cook said while at the farm, where 
forensic experts are examining remains of what are believed to be 
massacre victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``They must have known what was coming, and then they were  
brutally shot through the doors,'' Cook said. ``We hope they were 
all dead because they were then set on fire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also visiting Kosovo today were the foreign ministers of France,  
Italy and Germany, along with the French and German defense 
ministers. 
</P>
<P>
	Later today they were to meet in Pristina, the provincial  
capital, with U.N. special representative Sergio Vieira de Mello 
and NATO's Kosovo commander, British Lt. Gen. Mike Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	Velika Krusa was one of several sites mentioned in the  
international war crimes tribunal's indictment of Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not going to give up on this,'' Cook said. ``We are  
after those who instructed this atrocity and the systematic program 
of atrocities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said today that Russian  
peacekeepers could join NATO forces in Yugoslavia's war-torn Kosovo 
province as early as Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sergeyev said the troops would be ready to deploy in three hours  
once Russia's upper house of parliament approves a peacekeeping 
plan. The body will start considering the plan Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's plan calls for sending 3,600 troops to Kosovo, as  
agreed during talks with U.S. officials last week. The troops would 
serve under Russian command, but would work with NATO commanders in 
the sectors of Kosovo controlled by the United States, France and 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	In the northern city of Kosovska Mitrovica, where French  
peacekeepers have been trying to keep a lid on tensions between 
Serbs and ethnic Albanians, French Defense Minister Alain Richard 
defended the actions of his soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic Albanians there have complained that the French, who have  
historical ties with Serbia, were giving preferential treatment to 
the Serbs at their expense. 
</P>
<P>
	French peacekeepers looked on Tuesday as Serbs menaced some  
people wanting to cross a bridge to a side of town containing the 
main hospital, many ethnic Albanian homes and almost the only open 
food shops. 
</P>
<P>
	The French soldiers were simply trying to permit all Kosovo  
residents ``to live in safety,'' Richard said in defense of the 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in Kosovo, German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer and  
Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping were due to visit Prizren in the 
southeast, where German peacekeepers shot and killed a Serb in a 
confrontation when they arrived nearly two weeks ago. The Germans 
also have been busy disarming rebel ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini and France's Hubert  
Vedrine also were visiting various parts of the province. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, ethnic Albanian refugees were ignoring warnings about  
land mines and flooding back into the province at an alarming rate 
-- 207,000 in the past eight days alone, according to the U.N. High 
Commissioner for Refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a phenomenal rate -- absolutely staggering,'' said  
Rupert Colville, a UNHCR spokesman in Prizren. 
</P>
<P>
	UNHCR spokeswoman Paula Ghedini said in Pristina that supplying  
tents and plastic sheeting for temporary repairs was becoming a 
priority for aid convoys, especially those going to the western 
Kosovo towns of Pec and Djakovica. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations estimates that about 860,000 ethnic Albanians  
fled Kosovo or were expelled by Serb forces after NATO launched a 
78-day bombing campaign March 24 to force Yugoslavia to accept a 
peace plan for the province. 
</P>
<P>
	Refugees began to trickle back from camps in neighboring  
Macedonia, Albania and Montenegro after NATO peacekeepers started 
deploying June 12 and Serb forces began pulling out under the peace 
deal. That quickly turned into a flood, and dozens of civilians 
have died or been injured by land mines or unexploded bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	Though NATO has pledged to protect Serbs, who were only 10  
percent of the prewar population of 2.1 million, tens of thousands 
have fled for fear of reprisals for the brutality visited on 
Kosovo's Albanians by Serb troops and special police. 
</P>
<P>
	Scattered evidence of such reprisals have emerged in recent days  
despite NATO's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Serbs were killed in the southern Kosovo town of Urosevac by  
Albanian separatists, the independent Beta news agency reported 
today. It said only seven Serbs and a Serbian Orthodox priest 
remained in the town, where the prewar Serb population of was about 
30,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoke from two burning houses in the divided city of Pec rose up  
into the mountains Tuesday. Ethnic Albanians watched one Serb house 
burn and asserted that the Serbs had set the fire themselves. The 
residents couldn't be found.

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's foreign minister on  
Wednesday said his government would not reverse its decision to 
deny Venezuelan air space to U.S. anti-drug planes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We work intensely in the fight against drugs, but we don't  
necessarily share all the ideas that the United States has about 
the topic,'' Jose Vicente Rangel told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing ``national sovereignty,'' Venezuela has refused a U.S.  
request to use its airspace for anti-narcotics flights from three 
new staging centers being set up in Ecuador and the Dutch islands 
of Curacao and Aruba. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the head of the U.S. Southern Command, Gen. Charles  
Wilhelm, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that ``it is 
imperative that we come to closure with Venezuela on counterdrug 
cooperation. Otherwise, our efforts throughout the region will 
suffer in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.''

	Venezuela is a key transit point for Colombian cocaine en route  
to the United States and Europe.

	PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) -- Panama on Wednesday angrily dismissed  
as ``unacceptable'' a U.S. assessment that its police are incapable 
of controlling any threat posed by Colombian rebels along the 
border. 
</P>
<P>
	Eager to get rid of the last U.S. troops stationed here and  
sensitive to any potential pretext for their continued presence, 
Panama said isolated incursions by the leftist rebels were 
unrelated to the security of the canal zone. 
</P>
<P>
	``The canal is functioning perfectly and we are confident that  
it will continue to do so after Dec. 31,'' when the last U.S. 
troops are scheduled to withdraw, said Foreign Minister Eduardo 
Ritter. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Charles E. Wilhelm, ranking U.S. commander for Latin  
America, said Tuesday that Colombian guerrillas have been 
conducting repeated incursions into Panama, taking advantage of 
U.S. troop reductions there.

	LIMA, Peru (AP) -- President Alberto Fujimori's re-election hopes  
grew Wednesday after an opinion poll showed him topping his main 
rival for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Fujimori has not said if he will run for a third consecutive  
term as president in next April's elections, but the 
Fujimori-controlled Congress has passed a controversial law 
circumventing a constitutional ban on his candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	A poll of Lima residents by the private company Apoyo showed  
Fujimori with 29 percent support, topping Lima's popular Mayor 
Alberto Andrade, who had 25 percent, and Luis Castaneda, the former 
director of Peru's Social Security Institute, with 24 percent. The 
margin of error was 4 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Fujimori was first elected as a political outsider in 1990 and  
re-elected in a landslide in 1995 by Peruvians elated over the 
capture of top leftist rebel leaders and ending annual inflation 
that topped 7,000 percent in 1990.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Foreigners ordered to leave Mexico for  
alleged involvement in domestic politics would be able to appeal 
under a proposal by the governmental Human Rights Commission, the 
media reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico has expelled more than 100 foreigners, many who claimed  
to be acting as human rights observers, from the southern state of 
Chiapas since 1998 under an extremely vague constitutional article 
that allows the president to expel any ``undesirable foreigner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The changes to the article would give the foreigners a chance to  
appeal the expulsion order, said Mireille Rocatti, commission 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexican law prohibits foreigners from becoming involved in or  
stating opinions about Mexican politics and requires special visas 
for foreigners acting as human rights observers or aid workers.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A Mexican court has refused to extradite a

extradite Everardo Arturo Paez Martinez, citing a lack of evidence, 
attorney Eugenio Zafra Garcia said. It issued its ruling last week.

<P>
	Paez Martinez, 30, is suspected of being a top lieutenant of  
Mexico's most violent drug gang, based in the border city of 
Tijuana.

distribute 2,200 pounds of cocaine in the United States.

<HEADLINE> N. Korea, S. Korea Talks in Limbo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- The highest level talks between rivals North and  
South Korea in 14 months were in limbo today after negotiators 
traded sharp words over a naval gunbattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiators met for 90 minutes Tuesday in a Beijing hotel to  
discuss reuniting families separated by the 54-year split between 
the communist North and capitalist South. But the session ended 
with caustic words and North Korea demanding an apology for last 
week's naval skirmish. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korean Unification Minister Lim Dong-won indicated today  
in Seoul that North Korea's refusal to discuss family reunions 
could scuttle the talks -- as it did in April 1998, the last time 
the governments negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
	A North Korean official in Beijing advised the South Koreans by  
phone that the delegation was awaiting instructions from Pyongyang, 
South Korean embassy spokesman Wi Keyei-chul said. 
</P>
<P>
	While those meetings remained on hold, the top U.S. official on  
North Korea, Charles Kartman, opened two days of talks with North 
Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kim Gye Gwan at Beijing's swanky China 
World Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have good communication and we've been able to cover a lot  
of different topics,'' Kartman said by telephone, refusing to give 
details. 
</P>
<P>
	Officially, the agenda covered upcoming peace talks with South  
Korea and China and last month's inspection by U.S. experts of a 
suspected underground weapons facility in North Korea. But Western 
diplomats expected the clash between the North Korean and South 
Korean navies to intrude. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, the State Department announced that American,  
Japanese and South Korean officials will meet there Friday to 
coordinate their dealings with North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	The diplomacy in Beijing combined with the naval battle and  
North Korea's detention this week of a South Korean tourist fit a 
familiar negotiating tactic. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea has repeatedly tried to use warlike maneuvers to  
wrest concessions from foes South Korea and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	With its economy in ruins and four years of famine threatening  
to stretch into a fifth, North Korea is in desperate need of aid. 
South Korea's Lim threatened today to stop shipping 200,000 tons of 
fertilizer if Pyongyang does not discuss family reunions in Beijing 
as agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	A series of confrontations between North and South Korean  
warships in contested waters exploded in gunfire on June 15. One 
North Korean gunboat was sunk and about 30 North Korean sailors are 
believed to have died. The United States sent two guided-missile 
cruisers to the area. 
</P>
<P>
	At Tuesday's talks in Beijing, North Korea's chief delegate, Pak  
Yong Su, accused Seoul of engineering the confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a result, the situation on the peninsula is driven to the  
brink of war,'' Pak said, in an account released by North Korea's 
state-run Korean Central News Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	His counterpart, South Korean Vice Unification Minister Yang  
Young-shik, accused North Korea of triggering the shootout by 
violating South Korean waters. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the North perpetrates similar provocations again, South  
Korea will respond sternly in self-defense,'' Yang said. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 10 million people were separated from their  
families by the partition of the Korean peninsula in 1945 and the 
Korean War in 1950-53.

	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Gays and lesbians are one step closer  
to being eligible to become ministers in the Presbyterian church. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 24-14 vote Tuesday, the Church Orders and Ministry  
committee of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) recommended striking 
a clause from the church's constitution that, in effect, prohibits 
homosexuals from being ordained. 
</P>
<P>
	The clause requires clergy to live within standards that include  
``fidelity within the covenant of marriage between a man and a

practicing homosexuals'' is contained in a separate 1978 policy 
based on the constitution. That policy could be challenged if the 
constitutional change is ratified. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am pleasantly surprised by this,'' said the Rev. Don Stroud,  
a gay man who was ordained before the 1978 policy was adopted. ``I 
am a gay man that was blessed to be called by the church.'' He said 
a policy excluding homosexuals in effect says that ``my right to 
serve the Lord is based on me being heterosexual and not the grace 
of God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The issue now goes to the full 560-member assembly later this  
week during the denomination's annual meeting. Approval would 
require a simple majority. 
</P>
<P>
	If the measure passes, it then goes before the ordained  
Presbyterian ministers and elders nationwide for approval. The 
majority of 173 presbyteries, or regional governing bodies, must 
agree to the change. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents have argued that practicing homosexuality goes against  
biblical principles by which the church should abide. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is scandalous to the gospel the way these people behave,''  
the Rev. Stephen Moss, a committee member, said during the heated 
debate. ``I know of no other behavior that the Scripture forbids 
that is upheld by the church as proper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) has about 3 million members.

<HEADLINE>  India To Capture Kashmiri Peak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DRAS, India (AP) -- Indian soldiers made final preparations today  
to clear Islamic guerrillas from the last peak overlooking a 
northern highway in Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
	India's Home Minister L.K. Advani said he could not rule out a  
third, full-scale war over the Himalayan territory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pakistan is a rogue state having several centers of power, ''  
local news agencies quoted Advani as saying. ``I cannot say there 
could not be a war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	India says Pakistani army soldiers infiltrated into Indian-held  
Kashmir earlier this year to seize strategic heights in an attempt 
to change the Line of Control -- the 1972 cease-fire line that 
divides Kashmir between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan says the fighters are local Kashmiris seeking to  
further their 10 year rebellion against Indian rule. 
</P>
<P>
	India maintains its soldiers have not crossed the line, although  
both armies are shelling each other. 
</P>
<P>
	The United News of India reported that a woman was injured and a  
house damaged today in Pakistani shelling of Shahpur, 30 miles 
southwest of the Line of Control. 
</P>
<P>
	Touring army and air force bases, Defense Minister George  
Fernandes was quoted by United News of India as saying that any 
decision to cross the cease-fire line would be taken, if needed, 
``at the appropriate time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A major assault was expected within a few days on Tiger Hills, a  
strategic peak, said Brig. Amar Aul, a local commander in Dras. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our troops are acclimatized now. We are prepared to face the  
challenge,'' he told reporters Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The mountain range looms over the thin ribbon of asphalt,  
providing a view of National Highway 1. In two weeks of ferocious 
battles, India has cleared two other peaks in the same region of 
Muslim rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	India-based ambassadors from Britain and Germany joined the  
United States and Russia in saying that Pakistan was involved in 
the intrusion. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we look at the location, at the equipment and logistics  
necessary for such exercise, then I think it is difficult to 
believe there was no involvement'' by Pakistan, Heinrich-Dietrich 
Dieckmann, the German ambassador, told the private STAR television 
station. 
</P>
<P>
	Near Batalik, field commander Col. Avtar Singh said India has  
gathered the bodies of up to 60 Pakistani soldiers and sent them 
back to Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan's military accused India on Tuesday of relentless  
assaults on army posts, cross-border shelling and air raids. 
</P>
<P>
	``The threatening posture of the Indian armed forces (has)  
contributed to the fading of hopes for peace and India stands 
totally responsible for the escalation of the situation,'' warned a 
Pakistan army statement.

<HEADLINE> MLS Denies Matthaeus Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MUNICH, Germany (AP) -- Bayern Munich star Lothar Matthaeus was  
quoted Wednesday as saying he will join the New York/New Jersey 
MetroStars next season, but Major League Soccer disputed his 
account. 
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year-old sweeper, a former captain of Germany's national  
team, was quoted in the daily Bild as saying he will play for 
Bayern Munich until the Bundesliga's winter break. 
</P>
<P>
	``My plan is to quit (Munich) in winter. In January, take  
vacation. In February, train with Munich. And in March, the season 
in the United States begins,'' Matthaeus said. 
</P>
<P>
	German reports said Matthaeus has signed a contract with the  
MetroStars -- leaving only the date he will join the club open -- and 
will receive $1 million a year. The team's coach Bora Milutinovic 
is a personal friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not in active discussions with Lothar Matthaeus to play  
in Major League Soccer,'' said Todd Durbin, the league's vice 
president of player personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthaeus was FIFA's world player of the year in 1991, a year  
after he helped lead Germany to the World Cup title. Slower than in 
his prime, he is still a key player on the national team and the 
country's premier club, Bayern Munich. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthaeus has 136 appearances for Germany and has a chance to  
break the international record of 143 set by Swedish goalkeeper 
Thomas Ravelli. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany coach Erich Ribbech expects Matthaeus to play in next  
year's European Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if he's in America, he'll perform. I know exactly what I  
have in him,'' said national coach Erich Ribbeck.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Mixed / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices were mixed today  
in listless early dealings on the Chicago Board of Trade as 
investors examined competing weather fundamentals. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn, spring wheat and soybean futures were pressured by  
widespread rainfall across the Midwest that should replenish soil 
moisture and aid young crops. 
</P>
<P>
	But some meteorologists again were calling for above-normal  
temperatures to move into major growing areas next week. Sustained 
hot weather and low moisture could stress crops and reduce yields. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat also found support on continued harvesting delays in the  
winter wheat-growing states. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery rose 1/2 cent to $2.50 3/4 a bushel; July  
corn fell 1/4 cent to $2.16 a bushel; July oats rose 1/4 cent to $1.13 1/4 
a bushel; July soybeans fell 1/4 cent to $4.67 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle futures were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange, while feeder cattle and pork futures advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle fell .10 cent to 63.60 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle rose .18 cent to 77.35 cents a pound; August lean 
hogs rose .10 cent to 53.60 cents a pound; August pork bellies rose 
1.18 cents to 44.80 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Major Supreme Court Decisions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Major decisions of the Supreme Court's just-completed 1998-99  
term: 
</P>
<P>
	--States cannot be sued by businesses or individuals in state  
courts over alleged violations of federal rights, including patent 
and trademark infringements. 
</P>
<P>
	--The federal Americans with Disabilities Act does not generally  
protect people with physical impairments that are correctable with 
medication or devices such as eyeglasses and hearing aids. 
</P>
<P>
	--States have an obligation under that act to let mentally  
disabled people live in homelike settings instead of state 
hospitals when such arrangements are appropriate and can be done 
without extreme disruption to a state's commitment to all mentally 
disabled persons in its charge. 
</P>
<P>
	--A federal law that barred television and radio broadcasters  
from fully advertising casino gambling violated free-speech rights. 
</P>
<P>
	--Chicago went too far in attempting to fight street gang crimes  
by ordering police to break up loitering groups that contained at 
least one gang member. 
</P>
<P>
	--Police violate people's privacy rights when letting TV camera  
crews and other news media members accompany them when they enter 
someone's home to make an arrest or conduct a search. 
</P>
<P>
	--Schools can be sued when officials ignore serious sexual  
harassment by students against other students. 
</P>
<P>
	--States cannot pay newcomers less in welfare benefits than  
longtime residents because to do so would violate the 
constitutionally protected right to travel. 
</P>
<P>
	--Personal belongings of all passengers in a car may be searched  
if police have reason to believe the driver may have drugs or other 
contraband inside. 
</P>
<P>
	--Statistical sampling cannot be used in the 2000 census to  
determine how many members of Congress each state is entitled to. 
</P>
<P>
	--Short-term guests at someone's home have no privacy rights  
against unreasonable police searches and seizures.

<HEADLINE> Atico Recalls Angels Candleholders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Atico International is recalling about 18,000  
angel candleholders because they may pose a fire hazard, the 
Consumer Product Safety Commission said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has received one report of a candleholder melting,  
resulting in minor property damage. No injuries have been reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The angel's plastic head can come into contact with the flame of  
the candle, which is placed in a holder on the back of the angel, 
the commission said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eckerd Drug Stores sold the candleholder nationwide between  
August 1998 and January 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The company recommends consumers stop using the candleholders  
immediately and return them to any Eckerd store for a refund. 
</P>
<P>
	For more information, customers may call Atico at (800)  
645-3867.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Boosts States' Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court dramatically enhanced  
states' rights today in decisions that exposed an increasingly 
bitter 5-4 ideological split among the justices over how to balance 
federal and state powers. Dissenters called the conservative 
majority's rulings ``indefensible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Announced as the court ended its 1998-99 term, the three  
decisions eroded Congress' power over the states. But the biggest 
losers may be businesses and individual Americans who think states 
violated their federally protected rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices killed lawsuits that accused Maine of illegally  
failing to pay some employees for overtime work and Florida of 
violating federal patent and trademark laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The court's dissenters and others voiced outrage, accusing the  
court of placing states above the law. 
</P>
<P>
	The relationship between the federal government and the states --  
what constitutional scholars call federalism -- is not widely 
considered as politically explosive as abortion, religion and other 
topics that reach the nation's highest court. But the court's view 
of that relationship defines in profound and fundamental ways the 
ebb and flow of political power. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's decisions continued a recent trend in which the  
court, by a series of 5-4 rulings, has shown increasing sensitivity 
to how individual states' authority fares when pitted against the 
federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	As in those previous rulings, the conservative coalition of  
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day 
O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas 
prevailed over more liberal colleagues John Paul Stevens, David H. 
Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Maine case, the court said states cannot be sued against  
their will in state courts by people seeking to enforce some 
federal right. The ruling spelled defeat for 68 state-employed 
probation officers who sought to collect overtime pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy wrote for the court that the Constitution's ``structure  
and history'' not only shield states from being sued in federal 
courts but also make them immune from state court lawsuits in which 
private parties seek to enforce a federal right. 
</P>
<P>
	That left Maine's probation workers with a federally protected  
right to be paid time-and-a-half for all work in excess of 40 hours 
a week but with no way to enforce that right besides trying to get 
the federal government to sue the state for them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress has vast power but not all power,'' Kennedy said in a  
51-page opinion that surveyed over 200 years of American history. 
</P>
<P>
	States ``are not relegated to the role of mere provinces or  
political corporations, but retain the dignity, though not the full 
authority, of sovereignty,'' he said. ``Although the Constitution 
begins with the principle that sovereignty rests with the people, 
it does not follow that the national government becomes the 
ultimate, preferred mechanism for expressing the people's will. The 
states exist as a refutation of that concept.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy also noted that individuals are still free to sue state  
officials, though such lawsuits only reach those officials' 
pocketbooks, not state treasuries'. 
</P>
<P>
	Souter, who wrote a 58-page opinion for the dissenters, called  
the court's reasoning ``unrealistic'' and ``indefensible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a tense exchange with Kennedy as both summarized their  
opinions from the bench, Souter said court had created ``a very 
peculiar state of affairs'' for those wanting to enforce their 
legal rights against a state government. 
</P>
<P>
	And after Rehnquist read from his opinion barring patent holders  
from suing states in federal court over alleged infringements, 
Stevens complained aloud of the court's sweeping view of the 
sovereign-immunity doctrine. ``The doctrine, I fear, is much like a 
mindless dragon that indiscriminately chews gaping holes in federal 
statutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens added: ``The principle that 'no man is above the law' --  
which applies to the president of the United States as well as the 
lowliest public servant -- should apply equally to the states.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Trzyna, a patent lawyer from Chicago, said, ``This was not  
a good day for innovators but it was a great day for thieves -- open 
season for states to rip off America's most creative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Fontaine, a Portland, Maine, lawyer who represented the  
probation workers, called the ruling against his clients part of 
``an extraordinary, conservative revolution against basic civil 
rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Florida cases, the state had come under attack for its  
program to help families save for the cost of the state's public 
colleges and universities. College Savings Bank, based in 
Princeton, N.J., sued the state twice in 1994-- once under federal 
patent law and once under federal trademark law, alleging false 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	College Savings Bank since 1987 has marketed certificates of  
deposit for financing future costs of education. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, in an opinion by Scalia, said Congress lacked the  
power to pierce states' sovereign immunity by making them liable 
for violations of a 1992 federal law, the Trademark Remedy 
Clarification Act. In so ruling, the court overturned its own 1964 
decision that, along with subsequent rulings, indicated that states 
waive their immunity when they enter the marketplace as 
participants, not regulators.

<HEADLINE> France Seeks Modified Food Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- France will step up its fight against genetically  
modified food by asking its European Union partners to ban any new 
marketing of the crops, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Environment Minister Dominique Voynet, a member of the Green  
Party that is part of Lionel Jospin's Socialist government, said 
France will request a ban during a meeting Thursday of her EU 
counterparts in Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
	France is a leading voice against genetically modified crops,  
and says there is a need for better labeling, and uniform EU rules 
on production and marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	But some of France's European partners, especially Britain,  
favor genetically modified foods. 
</P>
<P>
	The Group of Eight world leaders on Sunday asked for an  
international inquiry into the safety of modified food. 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders, ending a three-day annual summit, asked two  
committees of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development to study biotechnology in food production.

<HEADLINE> Compaq Shares Rise Amid Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Compaq Computer Corp. reportedly is planning to  
sell some of its properties -- including the AltaVista search engine 
-- to Internet investment company CMGI Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors began sifting through the market Tuesday that Compaq was  
considering such a sale, pushing shares up, financial journalist 
Dan Dorfman reported on JagNotes, an investment Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq was the most actively traded stock on the New York Stock  
Exchange with nearly 29 million shares exchanging hands. It 
finished up 8 percent, or $1.68 3/4, at $23.81 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	After the market had closed, the financial news cable network  
CNBC also reported that CMGI and Compaq were discussing the sale of 
a number of assets, including AltaVista. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq shares have been struggling in recent weeks, trading  
barely above their 52-week low of $20 and well off their high of 
$51.25. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq, the largest computer maker in the world, warned last  
week it will report a big loss this quarter and lay off thousands 
of employees, the latest in a series of bad news for the 
Houston-based company. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 9, the company disclosed that its first-quarter profits  
would be half of what Wall Street expected. That news was followed 
quickly by the ouster of its chief executive Eckhard Pfeiffer and 
the departure of a half-dozen other top managers. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials for the Andover, Mass.-based CMGI and Compaq did not  
immediately return phone calls seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> US, Mexican Officials Discuss Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) -- Mexican and U.S. officials are putting  
aside their differences over drug smuggling -- at least for three 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexican Health Minister Juan Ramon de la Fuente and Barry  
McCaffrey, director of the U.S. Office of National Drug Control 
Policy, started a three-day conference today in the border city of 
Tijuana, one of the centers of the narcotics trade. 
</P>
<P>
	But they are focusing on treatment and prevention of addiction,  
not drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are convinced that the center of our drug strategy and the  
center of our drug cooperation is to reduce the consumption of 
drugs among young people,'' McCaffrey said after touring a 
treatment center. 
</P>
<P>
	De la Fuente and McCaffrey are the top officials at the second  
U.S.-Mexico Drug Demand Reduction conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``The purpose is to send a very clear message to Mexican society  
and to U.S. society that we are putting particular emphasis on 
prevention and treatment,'' De la Fuente said. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug use in Mexico has risen 30 percent in the last 5 years, he  
said, citing a greater availability of drugs and the influence of 
the U.S. drug culture on Mexican citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	The highest concentration of the country's drug addicts are in  
Tijuana, said Jesus Cabrera, president of the non-profit Center of 
Juvenile Integration, an organization that runs drug treatment 
clinics in Mexico including the facility toured by officials 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tijuana is believed to be the operation base for Ramon and  
Benjamin Arellano-Felix, brothers who control one of Mexico's major 
drug cartels. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramon Arellano is on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List and federal  
authorities have offered a $2 million reward for information 
leading to his arrest.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Weapons Chief Butler Leaving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard  
Butler is leaving his post at the end of the month after two 
sometimes stormy years without any parting shots -- just praise for 
his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Butler turned down all requests for interviews with a brief  
statement to the media Wednesday saying he had been honored to head 
``a unique arms control organization'' whose record of achievement 
has been outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. Special Commission, known by its initials UNSCOM, is  
charged with eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, a 
measure intended to punish and disarm Baghdad for attacking Kuwait 
in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq banned UNSCOM from returning after Butler ordered  
inspectors out of Baghdad just before U.S. and British airstrikes 
in mid-December. Russia and China have repeatedly called for UNSCOM 
to be abolished, and Security Council discussions on a new weapons 
inspection and monitoring organization are under way. 
</P>
<P>
	Butler, whose U.N. contract expires June 30, will head across  
New York City to become diplomat-in-residence at the Council on 
Foreign Relations in mid-July. He said he plans to write a book. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that what I will write and say, in the future, will be  
helpful and of interest,'' Butler said in his statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, one of Butler's staunchest supporters, is  
throwing Butler a going-away party June 29.

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Rhys Ifans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- He's the roommate from hell.  
</P>
<P>
	Unemployed, unshaven and slothful, Spike chain-smokes and eats  
cereal while dressed in a wet suit because all his clothes are 
dirty. He forgets to take important phone messages, and blabs to 
friends at the local pub that a famous American movie star is 
hiding out at his roommate's London flat. 
</P>
<P>
	This leads to the startling moment when Spike opens the bright  
blue door of his house in ``Notting Hill'' to find hundreds of 
paparazzi camped out on the doorstep. While the famous movie star 
retreats in shock and panic, Spike seizes HIS moment of celebrity 
to flex and pose his noodle-thin body for the cameras -- wearing 
nothing but skimpy underwear. 
</P>
<P>
	``And that was the first scene I shot. The very first day. So it  
was baptism by fire, that one,'' said Rhys Ifans. The film stars 
Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts, but it is Ifans who has audiences 
buzzing. 
</P>
<P>
	Going one-on-one with Ifans, 31, whose previous films include  
``Twin Town'' (with his younger brother) and ``Dancing at 
Lughnasa,'' one learns that there is nothing of Spike in the 
6-foot-2-inch actor, who pronounces his name Reece EEFans. His 
quick wit and intelligence are in sharp contrast to the lethargic, 
dimwitted character he plays on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
	Ifans was born in Wales. At 14 or 15, he joined a youth theater.  
At 18, he applied to drama schools in London and was accepted at 
the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, where he studied for three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	His schooling was followed by ``five, six years of intensive  
theater work,'' performing ``a plethora of stuff'' in and around 
London, including the Royal National Theatre. His training included 
``a lot of Shakespeare, and we studied the classics intensely in 
college as well, so I'm a big fan of the Bard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He had worked with ``Notting Hill'' director Roger Michelle in a  
production of ``Under Milk Wood'' at the Royal National Theatre. 
``Disturbingly, I sprung to mind when he thought of Spike.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ifans' teeth were yellowed and a gold tooth was added (his idea)  
to play Spike. ``Physically and visually, I run riot,'' he laughed. 
His wardrobe consisted of a wet suit and some underwear, which the 
costumers let him keep. (``They very cruelly sent me everything -- 
in a box.'') 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Ifans, who stands very upright, Spike has a terrible  
slouch, which Ifans found ``quite strenuous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``And I'm a lot faster than Spike. A lot twitchier, and so that  
was really quite difficult to slow it all down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ifans wasn't expected to generate a media buzz. But critics have  
called him a ``scene stealer,'' a term Ifans dislikes ``because it 
implies a selfish actor. And Spike's whole comedy depends on the 
generosity of the other protagonists. And if Spike isn't ... 
responded to accordingly, then his comedy doesn't work. So it's 
again thanks to Hugh Grant and Julia's generosity as actors that 
Spike works as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ifans, who lives in London, has several upcoming films,  
including ``Rancid Aluminum'' with Joseph Fiennes. 
</P>
<P>
	1: How would you describe Spike?  
</P>
<P>
	Ifans: I describe him as domestically challenged. (pause) With  
the artistic eye of an angel. (pause) And the underpants of Satan. 
(laughing) 
</P>
<P>
	1 1/2: What's Spike's background?  
</P>
<P>
	Ifans: The story I have in my head was Spike had traveled to  
London from Wales in search of lethargy. (laughs) And in Notting 
Hill, there's a lot of Spike-like people who seem to do a lot of 
nothing. He's on welfare. But says he's an artist. And I think 
that's his whole thing. A big pile of washing up for Spike would 
just be a very interesting form and shape, as opposed to a job that 
needed doing. 
</P>
<P>
	2: How much did your wardrobe cost? Would $100 be a fair  
estimate? 
</P>
<P>
	Ifans: Oh, gosh no. I'd say even less. I'd say about $40. If  
that. And most of Spike's wardrobe anyway is borrowed from other 
people, so I think he only owns his flip-flops. 
</P>
<P>
	2 1/2: Were those underpants your own?  
</P>
<P>
	Ifans (laughing): No, no, no, the pants were Hugh Grant's,  
that's what I'm telling everyone. They were very tight, too. 
</P>
<P>
	3: Apart from the skimpy wardrobe, how challenging was the role?  
</P>
<P>
	Ifans: I think the challenge with Spike was not playing him like  
a parasite, who is there to take advantage of Hugh Grant's 
hospitality and generosity. Spike is oblivious to the 20th century. 
And I think it just enables an audience then to forgive him for all 
these faults. And people, I think, like him then because they've 
discovered that they actually haven't judged a book by its cover; 
that really this is a nice guy and the fun is forgiving Spike. 
</P>
<P>
	4: How do you suppose Spike and the Hugh Grant character end up  
sharing a flat in Notting Hill? 
</P>
<P>
	Ifans: I think Hugh Grant's character, following his divorce, is  
desperate for a flat-mate. Obviously! (laughs) That sort of made 
sense. But I don't think Spike will be there for very long. I think 
he's moved around quite a lot. 
</P>
<P>
	5: I wonder what happens to Spike after the film ends? Hugh  
Grant is married to Julia Roberts. Does Spike get married as well? 
</P>
<P>
	Ifans (laughing): No, I think maybe Spike becomes Hugh and  
Julia's gardener.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton May Be Hubbell Witness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A second appearance at the federal courthouse  
courtesy of Kenneth Starr would not be a pleasant experience for 
Hillary Rodham Clinton, if her first trip there is any guide. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a long day,'' she told reporters in 1996 after  
becoming the only first lady ever to be hauled before a federal 
grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Round 2 at the courthouse in Washington for Mrs. Clinton could  
come in August in the waning days of Starr's investigation of 
Webster Hubbell for allegedly concealing his and Mrs. Clinton's 
legal work on a fraudulent Arkansas land deal. 
</P>
<P>
	While she considers a run for the Senate, Starr has put her name  
on his list of potential witnesses against Hubbell, legal sources 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A court appearance by Mrs. Clinton while she's a Senate  
candidate is ``nothing they would have put in their campaign 
playbook, but barring major connections, revelations, it's not 
likely to be a big mover in terms of voter reaction,'' said Lee 
Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public 
Opinion in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Her testimony will ``reinforce'' the views of those ``who don't  
like her and for those who do like her, it's more of the same,'' 
Miringoff said. 
</P>
<P>
	The public view of Starr's office is that ``this is the gang  
that couldn't shoot straight; folks are saying `Forget it,''' said 
Democratic political consultant Peter Fenn. 
</P>
<P>
	``How can (Starr's prosecutors) imagine that they're going to  
get anything new, anything different, anything substantial, 
anything at all out of this that they haven't gotten in the past 
seven years; I don't know what planet these guys are on,'' Fenn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason for Mrs. Clinton's 1996 grand jury appearance was the  
still-unexplained reappearance in the White House family residence 
of her law firm billing records, which would be at the center of 
any testimony she gives in the Hubbell trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The records reveal that Mrs. Clinton and Hubbell, as partners at  
the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, Ark., both did legal work on 
Castle Grande, a 1,050-acre tract south of Little Rock that federal 
bank examiners say was riddled with insider dealing, fictitious 
sales and land flips. It was owned by Hubbell's father-in-law, Seth 
Ward, and Jim McDougal, Mrs. Clinton's partner in the Whitewater 
real estate venture. 
</P>
<P>
	She says she doesn't recall the work, but the billing records  
reflect that among other chores, Mrs. Clinton drafted a real estate 
option that pegged the price of a 22-acre slice of Castle Grande at 
$400,000. The government, which ended up owning the property when 
McDougal's savings and loan collapsed, got $38,000 for the parcel. 
</P>
<P>
	The inspector general at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.  
concluded that McDougal's S&AMP;L used the option prepared by Mrs. 
Clinton to deceive federal bank examiners about the payment of 
hundreds of thousands of dollars in real estate commissions to 
Ward. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton told federal regulators 55 times in a 1996  
interview that she didn't recall various aspects of the work she 
and her law firm did on Castle Grande, including authorizing the 
destruction of her warehoused law firm files on the project. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, her testimony may be valuable to Starr.  
</P>
<P>
	``Prosecutors may need her to authenticate some of the Rose Law  
Firm records, things she actually authored, and she's the witness 
and they need to put it in evidence,'' said former Iran-Contra 
prosecutor John Barrett, who now teaches law at St. John's 
University. ``She knows how the firm worked, how Hubbell worked, 
what his day-to-day lawyering was like and she certainly does have 
some recollection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton ``will be like most of the witnesses prosecutors  
have to call in public corruption cases ... colleagues and 
confidants and friends who aren't happy to be government 
witnesses,'' said Barrett.

<HEADLINE> Colo. Cops Kill Gunman, Find Bodies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CASTLE ROCK, Colo. (AP) -- A man was killed in a shootout with  
officers after driving up to the police station and opening fire 
early today. His three daughters were found dead in his 
bullet-riddled pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
	An initial investigation concluded Simon J. Gonzales shot the  
girls before driving to the police station, said Michael Knight, a 
spokesman for the 18th Judicial District Attorney's Office. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears the children were dead when they arrived at the  
police department,'' Knight said. ``The preliminary investigation 
does not indicate any of the officers' bullets struck the 
children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzales' wife had contacted police hours earlier because she  
was concerned about the safety of the girls, Police Chief Tony Lane 
said. She also said Gonzales, 30, had suicidal tendencies. Lane 
would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities identified Gonzales' children as Rebecca, 10,  
Katheryn, 8, and Leslie, 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Carter, a neighbor and family friend, said Gonzales and his  
wife began having marital problems earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	She obtained a court order May 21 to keep Gonzales 100 feet away  
from their home. Court records listed the reason as domestic 
abuse.The two separated and she filed for divorce Dec. 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzales drove up to the police station in the middle of  
downtown at 3:25 a.m., got out and opened fire, shattering one of 
the front windows and missing an officer inside by inches, Lane 
said. The officer and others returned fire, fatally wounding 
Gonzales. 
</P>
<P>
	Castle is a bedroom community of about 18,000 people 25 miles  
from Denver.

<HEADLINE> Major Papers Revamp Web Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hoping to lure in more Web surfers -- and  
advertising dollars -- newspaper publishers are rounding out their 
Web sites with more services like entertainment listings and online 
purchasing. 
</P>
<P>
	Three major newspaper publishers announced plans this week to  
reposition their Web sites as ``portals,'' or ports of entry for 
users of the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times, The Washington Post and the Knight Ridder  
newspaper group all unveiled separate plans to reach out to Web 
users in their communities. Dow Jones &AMP; Co., publisher of The Wall 
Street Journal, also announced plans in April to roll out a similar 
offering, an all-in-one business financial site. 
</P>
<P>
	With straight news now widely available on the Internet, major  
newspapers want to establish themselves as a leading gateway for 
online advertisers to reach residents of their local communities. 
The companies hope that by boosting advertising they will be able 
to generate profits that have thus far been elusive for most 
newspaper Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan G. Spoon, president and chief operating officer of The  
Washington Post Co., said in a speech that even though the company 
was pleased with the wide use of its Web site so far, ``We're just 
on the threshold of what we believe the Web can offer in terms of 
new services and ultimate profitability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers want and need a convenient entry into the entire  
local online information and commercial marketplace. We want to be 
the first stop on everyone's electronic journey to Washington,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post's upgraded site, due to be launched in the  
fall, will feature entertainment listings, neighborhood news, 
classifieds and online retailing. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times offered fewer specifics about its new Web  
offering. President Russell T. Lewis said the site will ``allow our 
upscale audience to use the Internet to obtain high-quality 
information in a variety of content areas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Ridder, chief executive of the Knight Ridder group, said  
his company is preparing to transform its newspaper Web sites into 
a nationwide network of regional Internet portals. Knight Ridder 
already links together the Web sites of 29 of it newspapers -- and 
16 other sites -- under a site called www.realcities.com. 
</P>
<P>
	The new project, ``Real Cities 2,'' would transform these sites  
into regional hubs in the top 25 U.S. advertising markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight Ridder is partnering with other newspaper companies in  
the project including A.H. Belo Corp., publisher of the Dallas 
Morning News, and Central Newspapers Inc., publisher of the Arizona 
Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street analysts present at the three-day conference, which  
was organized by the newspaper group Gannett Co., welcomed the 
publishers' promises to move more aggressively on the Internet, but 
reserved judgment on whether the strategies would succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a recognition that they need to move beyond the news,''  
said Lauren Rich Fine, a leading publishing industry analyst who 
works for Merrill Lynch. ``People don't only want the local news -- 
they want more entertainment listings and other services. It 
doesn't mean they're going to be successful, but it's an important 
change in mindset.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some newspaper executives struck a cautious tone at the  
conference about the need to keep up with the challenges posed by 
the new medium. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking Wednesday on his company's plans to expand its online  
offerings of classified advertising -- a classic cash cow for 
newspaper companies -- Hollinger International Inc. vice president 
Frederic Lebolt said: ``We're not one to be standing around 
nibbling the leaves while a meteor called the Internet comes 
hurtling toward us.''

<HEADLINE>  Plane Makes Street Landing in L.A. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A small plane crash landed at a busy  
intersection today and barreled between a pair of approaching 
school buses filled with children, ripping the fuel tanks from the 
plane but causing only minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could have been a catastrophe,'' said Socorro Serrano,  
spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
	Serrano said there were 42 students from Parthenia Street  
Elementary School and six from Lassen Elementary School on the 
buses. 
</P>
<P>
	The twin-engine Cessna 402 was headed for nearby Van Nuys  
Airport about 3 p.m. when it was forced to make an emergency 
landing on Hayvenhurst Avenue, airport spokeswoman Stacy Geere 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	As the plane reached Hayvenhurst and Parthenia Street, it  
collided with the buses as they entered the intersection from 
opposite directions. The impact tore the wing tips off the plane 
and wrecked the front ends of the buses. The plane rolled on for 
1,500 feet before coming to a stop. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody was screaming,'' 6-year-old Christian Garcia said  
later at Parthenia, where his mother went to meet him after hearing 
about the accident over the radio. 
</P>
<P>
	The 33-year-old female driver of one bus was taken to Northridge  
Medical Center in good condition with neck and back injuries, fire 
spokesman Brian Humphrey said. A 6-year-old child was treated at 
the scene for minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	An elementary school girl also was taken to Northridge Medical  
Center, where hospital spokesman Barry Ginsbarg said she was listed 
in fair condition and being examined for possible head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was truly a miracle,'' Humphrey said.  
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters led children off the buses one at a time. Some  
children seemed dazed, while others skipped or hopped away from the 
wreckage. Firefighters passed out soft drinks to the youngsters as 
they sat waiting on curbs. Another bus was sent to pick up the 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot climbed uninjured from his plane. It was not  
immediately known why he was forced to land on the street, Geere 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Nuys is 20 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles.

landing on Hayvenhurst Avenue, airport spokeswoman Stacy Geere 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	As the plane reached Hayvenhurst and Parthenia Street, it  
collided with the buses as they entered the intersection from 
opposite directions. The impact tore the wing tips off the plane 
and wrecked the front ends of the buses. The plane rolled on for 
1,500 feet before coming to a stop. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody was screaming,'' 6-year-old Christian Garcia said  
later at Parthenia, where his mother went to meet him after hearing 
about the accident over the radio. 
</P>
<P>
	The 33-year-old female driver of one bus was taken to Northridge  
Medical Center in good condition with neck and back injuries, fire 
spokesman Brian Humphrey said. A 6-year-old child was treated at 
the scene for minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	An elementary school girl also was taken to Northridge Medical  
Center, where hospital spokesman Barry Ginsbarg said she was listed 
in fair condition and being examined for possible head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was truly a miracle,'' Humphrey said.  
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters led children off the buses one at a time. Some  
children seemed dazed, while others skipped or hopped away from the 
wreckage. Firefighters passed out soft drinks to the youngsters as 
they sat waiting on curbs. Another bus was sent to pick up the 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot climbed uninjured from his plane. It was not  
immediately known why he was forced to land on the street, Geere 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Nuys is 20 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles.

<HEADLINE>  Cavs' Embry Elected To Hall of Fame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- A few weeks ago, Wayne Embry looked down the  
list of nominees for the Basketball Hall of Fame and did a double 
take when he got to the second name -- his own. 
</P>
<P>
	``I looked at it and I was surprised,'' Embry said. ``And I  
said, `Wow!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Embry, who in 1971 became the first black general manager in NBA  
history, got another surprise Wednesday when he was elected to the 
Basketball Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	The 62-year-old Embry, the Cleveland Cavaliers' president and  
chief operating officer, was elected for his contributions to 
basketball as an executive. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had to rely on playing ability to get in, I wouldn't be  
here right now,'' Embry joked during a news conference at Gund 
Arena. ``I could set a pick. I'd set a pick and then roll.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Entering the Hall of Fame along with Embry are Kevin McHale, the  
long-armed forward from the Boston Celtics; John Thompson, the 
combative Georgetown coach; Billie Moore, the first women's coach 
to lead two schools to national championships; and the late Fred 
Zollner, the NBA pioneer who owned the Fort Wayne and Detroit 
Pistons. The five will be inducted Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Embry, who has been a Hall of Fame trustee for years, said he  
was overwhelmed when he received the call at home Tuesday night 
from Springfield, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was emotional last night, and I'm emotional today,'' Embry  
said. ``To be elected into a distinct group of those who have 
played the game and coached the game and contributed to the game is 
just overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I looked at the list of nominees, I knew I was in good  
company,'' he said. ``And to be one of the five elected makes me 
feel really honored.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Embry was a five-time All-Star in an 11-year NBA playing career  
with the Cincinnati Royals, Boston Celtics and Milwaukee Bucks. He 
retired after the 1968-69 season, and two years later the Bucks 
made him their GM, the first black general manager in professional 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was all of 32 years old at the time,'' he said. ``I look  
back at that and am proud to say that, yes indeed, I am an 
African-American, but above all I'm a general manager. I never 
turned down a challenge and it was tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While with the Bucks, Embry pulled off one of the biggest trades  
in NBA history, sending Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to the Los Angeles 
Lakers for Elmore Smith, Dave Meyers, Brian Winters and Junior 
Bridgeman. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if it was his most trying time as a GM, Embry turned  
toward Cavs owner Gordon Gund and said laughing, ``No, there have 
been more trying than that. But that was a difficult one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Embry, twice named NBA exective of the year,  
was part of a front-office shakeup that saw Gund fire coach Mike 
Fratello and move Jim Paxson into Embry's GM spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great honor to follow him,'' said Paxson, busy  
interviewing coaching candidates and working out potential picks 
for next week's NBA draft. ``I hope I can do him proud as we go 
forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a day to celebrate and reflect for Embry, who wore the  
1968 NBA championship ring he won with the Celtics. He hasn't been 
able to win one during his 13 years with the Cavs, but said jewelry 
can never replace the relationships he has formed here. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the people that make this so special,'' he said. ``It's  
the letters and phone calls I get from former players thanking me 
for the inspiration I gave them. Working with people. It just 
pleases me to see people do well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Embry hasn't visited the Hall of Fame in years, and the next  
time he's there, part of him will be staying for good. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I go back for meetings, and I go into the hall I have  
this feeling, I don't know how to explain it,'' he said. ``It's 
overwhelming. Because you're standing there with greatness.''

<HEADLINE>  Astros' Dierker Leaves Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Smiling and joking, Larry Dierker put a Houston  
Astros cap on his shaved head and left the hospital Wednesday, 
eight days after brain surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	The 52-year-old manager will convalesce at home and hopes to  
return to work after the All-Star game July 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's pretty much the same old Larry,'' Dierker's wife, Judy,  
said. ``He kept his humor throughout. Even right after the surgery, 
he was telling everyone a story about Dizzy Dean that had everyone 
laughing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker had a seizure and collapsed in the dugout June 13. Two  
days later, he underwent 5 1/2 hours of surgery at Methodist Hospital 
to remove tangled blood vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a wonderful hospital. It's like staying at the Ritz  
Carlton, or being on a cruise ship,'' Dierker said. ``The only 
problem is, you can't get off. I like to get around and it's nice 
to open the curtains and see the sun and say, 'I'm getting out.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker was diagnosed with arteriovenous malformation, a  
condition in which people are born with malformed, sometimes 
tangled, arteries or veins in the brain. Over time, the vessels can 
dilate, pressuring neural tissue or even bursting and bleeding into 
the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the time I woke up and recovered from the sedatives, I  
have felt lucid and I have had my coordination and balance,'' 
Dierker said. ``I was amazed at that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Rob Parrish operated on Dierker and said the location of the  
blood vessels contributed to few complications. Tests after surgery 
showed he no longer had any clustered blood vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't seem to have any memory loss,'' Dierker said. ``I can  
do the crossword puzzles like I always could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker was the third member of the Astros staff to become ill  
this season. First-base coach Jose Cruz left the team May 10 
because of an irregular heartbeat. Hitting coach Tom McCraw left 
six days later for prostate cancer treatment. Cruz has returned to 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Galante is the interim manager in Dierker's absence.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have no problem relinquishing control or power,'' Dierker  
said. ``That's probably a function of my managerial style. I 
believe in letting the players play, make their mistakes and learn 
from that. I feel the same about Mattie and the staff. They are 
very capable.''

<HEADLINE>  Spurs Sub Is NBA Finals Spectator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lounging on bench for the San Antonio Spurs, not  
even suited up for this series because he's not good enough, is a 
silver-haired, 11-time scoring champion and seven-time MVP. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Gaze is a living legend in Australia, a stationary stiff  
in America. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just sort of sitting here, doing my thing,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	During these NBA Finals, which resumed Wednesday night with the  
Spurs leading the New York Knicks 2-1, Gaze is reduced to wearing a 
fancy suit rather than a black-and-silver uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	After appearing in only 19 games during the season and scoring  
21 points, Gaze was left off the playoff roster. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1989, Gaze led Seton Hall within one game of an NCAA  
championship. He was a seldom-used rookie for the Washington 
Bullets in 1993-94. He returned to the NBA when the lockout ended, 
looking for one more NBA paycheck and one more jaunt around the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was a fantastic opportunity at this stage of my  
career,'' he said after the Spurs' shootaround Wednesday. ``If I 
didn't accept it, I would have been kicking myself. Imagine if I 
was sitting home now watching this and saying `That could have been 
me?' Although it was tough to leave my team, it was just too good 
of an opportunity to turn down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gaze was averaging 33.5 points for the Melbourne Tigers of the  
National Basketball League when he left the team to sign with the 
Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	He averaged between 31.5 and 38.7 points during the 11 years he  
led the Australian League in scoring. He also was a four-time 
member of the Australian national team, including the 1996 squad 
that defeated Croatia en route to a fourth-place finish at the 
Atlanta Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The success of that team led to NBA jobs for two Aussies, Shane  
Heal and Mark Bradtke. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradtke spent one season with the Philadelphia 76ers and Heal  
spent one season with the Minnesota Timberwolves. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shane got paid for three, though. He did well,'' Gaze said,  
acknowledging that one of the main attractions of coming to America 
was an NBA-sized paycheck. Gaze signed for one year and $350,000; 
his bonus if the Spurs win the title will be about $90,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it takes some time to adjust,'' he said. ``And a lot  
of players aren't prepared to sit around and do their time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gaze isn't sure of his plans for next season, but he does plan  
to play on the next Australian Olympic team in 2000 when the games 
will be in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from Bradtke and Heal, there will be three members of the  
Aussie team with NBA experience -- Luc Longley of Phoenix, Chris 
Antsey of Dallas and Paul Rogers of Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the first time we'll have size, and a very experienced  
group on our home soil makes for a very good combination,'' Gaze 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another member of that team might be 21-year-old center Matt  
Nielsen, who becomes draft eligible in 2000 and is the most highly 
regarded young player Down Under. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of big kids coming through that are getting some  
attention. There's a lot of talent running around, and because 
culturally we're so similar, a lot of the NBA teams like to recruit 
in Australia,'' Gaze said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a wonderful opportunity to be a part of this for me  
personally, and most of the guys that come here, even though most 
of them haven't gotten to play much, have had very positive 
experiences. There's going to be more to come. The kids in 
Australia aspire to have a chance to play in the NBA.''

<HEADLINE> Boxer De La Hoya Gets Record Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Boxer Oscar De La Hoya has entered the music  
arena with a strong one-two combination: singing lessons and a 
record deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal with EMI Latin Records was closed Monday. It ended a  
bidding war for the fighter, who has been pursued by record labels 
since he sang last year on the Spanish-language talk show 
``Cristina,'' Daily Variety reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya will sing on Spanish- and English-language albums. He  
has been getting vocal instruction from celebrity voice coach Seth 
Riggs. 
</P>
<P>
	Artists at EMI Latin include Carlos Ponce, Ednita Nazario,  
Graciela Beltran and the late Selena.

	``From the time I woke up and recovered from the sedatives, I  
have felt lucid and I have had my coordination and balance,'' 
Dierker said. ``I was amazed at that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Rob Parrish operated on Dierker and said the location of the  
blood vessels contributed to few complications. Tests after surgery 
showed he no longer had any clustered blood vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't seem to have any memory loss,'' Dierker said. ``I can  
do the crossword puzzles like I always could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker was the third member of the Astros staff to become ill  
this season. First-base coach Jose Cruz left the team May 10 
because of an irregular heartbeat. Hitting coach Tom McCraw left 
six days later for prostate cancer treatment. Cruz has returned to 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Galante is the interim manager in Dierker's absence.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have no problem relinquishing control or power,'' Dierker  
said. ``That's probably a function of my managerial style. I 
believe in letting the players play, make their mistakes and learn 
from that. I feel the same about Mattie and the staff. They are 
very capable.''

<HEADLINE> Phillies' Relaford on 15-Day DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Phillies placed shortstop  
Desi Relaford on the 15-day disabled list Wednesday with a torn 
ligament in his right wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	To replace Relaford on the roster, the Phillies recalled pitcher  
Cliff Politte from Double-A Reading. 
</P>
<P>
	Relaford, 25, injured the wrist during batting practice before  
the Phillies faced San Diego on June 15. He played the first two 
games of the series with the injury but missed each of the next 
five games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took a swing and felt it,'' he said. ``I took another swing  
and it felt worse. Since it hadn't gotten better in a week, I kind 
of felt something was wrong but I was hoping it was not serious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An MRI on Wednesday revealed the tear and Phillies Team  
Physician Dr. Phillip Marone stated surgery would be required. 
Relaford is scheduled to be examined by Dr. Randall Culp, a hand 
specialist, today. 
</P>
<P>
	The timetable for Relaford's return hinged on the extent of the  
surgery. Marone confirmed Relaford would miss at least two months 
and there was a good chance he could miss the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	In 52 games, Relaford was batting .260 with 59 hits and 26 RBIs.  
</P>
<P>
	The Phillies plan to use a combination of Dave Doster and Alex  
Arias at shortstop. Doster was in Wednesday's starting lineup 
against the Pirates -- it was his first major league appearance at 
shortstop. Kevin Sefcik is a third option. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough to lose Desi, but I feel comfortable with the  
players we have here to fill the position,'' Phillies manager Terry 
Francona said. ``For the moment, we feel it would be better for the 
ball club to carry 12 pitchers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Politte was 3-6 with a 3.87 ERA in 13 starts at Reading. In his  
last three starts, he was 2-0 with a 1.92 ERA. However, the 
organization did plan to move Politte to the bullpen which will be 
his role with the Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt at this point, Cliff would have a more rapid future at  
the major league level as a reliever,'' Phillies general manager Ed 
Wade said. ``He has two polished pitches -- fastball and slider -- 
and he's been struggling with his changeup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Politte was acquired along with Jeff Brantley and Ron Gant from  
the St. Louis Cardinals for Ricky Bottalico and Garrett Stephenson 
on November 19.

<HEADLINE> Novelist: Messages From a Vast Space </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Some 20 years after coming to Cairo,  
novelist Ibrahim Abdel Meguid still longs for the sweeter air and 
wider spaces of his hometown, the northern port city of Alexandria. 
</P>
<P>
	But writers in the Third World, he says, must live in a  
country's capital, and so he remains. 
</P>
<P>
	Cairo is Egypt's only metropolis, a center for other writers,  
publishers, and the political life that so concerns Egyptian 
intellectuals. But living here has been a sacrifice for Abdel 
Meguid. Soon after arriving, he lost the hearing in his right ear 
and his sense of smell. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not know why it happened, but it allowed me to stay in  
Cairo. I feel as if I'm living in a vast space, even though Cairo 
is crowded and horrible,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	That sense of isolation is a recurring theme of the 53-year-old  
Abdel Meguid's seven novels, which have appeared in their original 
Arabic as well as French and English. 
</P>
<P>
	His latest to be translated to English, ``The Other Place,''  
revolves around a philosophy-English teacher who tries to shake 
himself out of the torpor of a failed life in Egypt by taking a 
clerical job in Saudi Arabia. But there, he re-creates the arid, 
constricted patterns he had followed in his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	In the earlier ``Hunter and Pigeon,'' a hunter seeks in vain  
because climate change has caused a vast migration of his 
traditional prey. 
</P>
<P>
	``The clash between man and nature is very important in my  
novels. And usually, man fails. Alienation comes not only from 
society, it can come from the cosmos,'' Abdel Meguid said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Alienation is not a doctrine. It is a state of the soul.''  
</P>
<P>
	The central character of his newest novel, ``No One Sleeps in  
Alexandria,'' is a telegraph operator who, out of idleness, begins 
to send messages to himself, and to the wife and children he 
doesn't have. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not insane. It's a very logical reaction for a man living  
isolated in a wide space, a weak man,'' said Abdel Meguid, whose 
own work often resembles such messages from a lonely place. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the reclusive Abdel Meguid sees writing as a dialogue. His  
earliest memories of literature are of his father reciting the 
Koran to him and his sister with such passion it brought tears to 
his eyes, and of his Alexandria neighborhood gathering around a 
radio to hear a dramatization of ``Tales From the Arabian Nights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He toyed with communism as a young man, but has since given up  
mass revolution to set his sights on something more subtle. 
</P>
<P>
	``A novel cannot change society, but it can change a man, a  
reader. It can create something good in the soul of a person, can 
maybe inspire them to revolt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abdel Meguid's writes at night, sometimes all night. He fills  
the left-hand pages of a large notebook in longhand. Later he goes 
back, making notes on the right-hand pages. 
</P>
<P>
	He ventures out once a week to the Union of Writers for tea and  
conversation. 
</P>
<P>
	He craves solitude. ``But you have to have friends,'' Abdel  
Meguid said.

	Alleged Kosovo Atrocity Sites Viewed  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- European foreign and defense  
ministers walked through farm buildings in Velika Krusa today where 
several dozen ethnic Albanian men reportedly were shot before the 
structures were set afire. The ministers from Britain, France, 
Italy and Germany also assessed the progress of the NATO-led 
peacekeeping mission, which began June 12. British Foreign Minister 
Robin Cook described the farm buildings as ``appalling.'' But he 
asked those who survived ``to leave it to the judicial authorities 
and to the police to pursue the task of doing justice to those who 
died and let us here in Kosovo break the cycle of violence and 
build a peaceful, nonviolent future for the future of the children 
of all communities of Kosovo.''

	U.N. Weapons Chief Butler Leaving  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard  
Butler is leaving his post at the end of the month after two 
sometimes stormy years without any parting shots -- just praise for 
his colleagues. Butler turned down all requests for interviews with 
a brief statement to the media today saying he had been honored to 
head ``a unique arms control organization'' whose record of 
achievement has been outstanding. The U.N. Special Commission is 
charged with eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, a 
measure intended to punish and disarm Baghdad for attacking Kuwait 
in 1990.

	Railroad Killer Profiled

	HOUSTON (AP) -- The railroad drifter wanted in eight killings has  
been arrested as many as 10 times from coast to coast. But most of 
Rafael Resendez-Ramirez's history involves burglary and getting 
caught trying to illegally obtain or use American identification. 
Authorities don't know what may have driven him to allegedly commit 
such violent crimes. ``It's almost as if he woke up someday and 
snapped,'' said West University police Sgt. Ken Macha, who is 
investigating one of the killings. ``There's no clear progression 
of violence.''

	Soft Fat-Hard Fat Choice Matters

Medicine looked at how harder, processed fats -- such as stick 
margarine, butter and lard -- affect cholesterol levels when 
compared with softer products like tub margarine and oil. The 
softer products were found to be healthier because the harder ones 
have more of what are called trans fatty acids, which raise 
cholesterol and the risk of heart disease.

garbage cans and a produce stand among vacation homes on one of the 
islands of the Outer Banks, and officials are trying to figure out 
what to do. The islands are home to about 30 horses, believed to be 
descendants of mustangs left by Spanish explorers. A fence running 
across Bodie Island is supposed to keep them away from 
neighborhoods. However, a mare and a stallion have repeatedly led 
five horses on raids to the south side of the fence.

information. This week, three major newspaper publishers announced 
plans to reposition their Web sites as ``portals,'' or ports of

<HEADLINE> House-Senate GOP Raise $9M at Dinner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Corporations interested in bills before  
Congress are some of the biggest donors to this year's Republican 
congressional dinner. The biggest fund-raisers are lobbyists and 
lawmakers, who personally pushed the $1,500-per-plate tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	BellSouth, Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., and American  
Airlines were among those bringing $100,000 each, earning 
invitations to mingle with congressional leaders at a private 
breakfast in addition to Wednesday night's dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	The annual House-Senate gala took in close to $9 million, a  
record for a non-election year, said its chairman, Sen. Paul 
Coverdell, R-Ga. The 1997 dinner raised $7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's black-tie affair at the Washington Convention Center  
drew 3,308 guests who dined on steak medallions and grilled shrimp. 
A short film displayed on four giant screens offered a cautionary 
tale of possible Democrat domination of Congress in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they're doing is giving tonight to us so that we can help  
build Republican majority, build it stronger for 2000. What they 
get from us is a good meal and good government,'' said Stuart Roy, 
a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	With a net change of six seats each in the House and the Senate  
in next year's election, Democrats could regain control of both for 
the first time since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	But many big contributors also are giving at a time when  
Congress is considering legislation affecting them. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which raised $50,000 for the  
dinner, helped lead the recent effort to pass legislation limiting 
lawsuits resulting from year 2000 computer problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important for the chamber to be visible with these kinds  
of events,'' said spokesman Frank Coleman. ``It reinforces the 
perception that the chamber is a political player in this town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	BellSouth contributed $100,000, earning corporate co-chairman  
status, at the request of the dinner chairman, Sen. Paul Coverdell, 
R-Ga., said company spokesman Bill McCloskey. ``We have lots of 
friends in Congress and we support our friends,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone company supports legislation that would let local  
phone companies send data worldwide, instead of restricting that 
business to long-distance telephone companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Other big donors include two tobacco companies, Brown &AMP;  
Williamson and U.S. Tobacco. In its report accompanying the Justice 
Department spending bill, the Senate Appropriations Committee last 
week said the bill included no money for the department to file a 
lawsuit against tobacco companies. The White House plans to sue the 
companies to recover smoking-related costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Also helping to raise funds were Kenneth Kies, former chief of  
staff of the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation; and Deborah 
Steelman, former deputy assistant to President Reagan. There were 
more than two dozen corporate supporters, including Microsoft, 
American Airlines and Bristol-Myers Squibb. 
</P>
<P>
	To encourage lawmakers to raise money for the congressional  
dinner, Rep. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, who headed fund-raising on the 
House side, pitted region against region. 
</P>
<P>
	The Northeastern lawmakers won by raising $584,000. Rep. John  
Sweeney, R-N.Y., led the effort, bringing in $338,000 himself. 
</P>
<P>
	The only freshman to head a House region, Sweeney was asked to  
take on the job by both Portman and Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. 
``He came well recommended,'' Portman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweeney used the same fund-raising network he had set up as the  
executive director of the New York State Republican Committee. He 
also made his pitch for dinner tickets at his own events and at 
fund-raisers he attended for other candidates. And he spent his 
spare time making phone calls for the dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important to be part of the team,'' Sweeney said.  
``Retaining the majority is a goal we all should be working 
toward.''

<HEADLINE> Spurs Sub Is NBA Finals Spectator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lounging on bench for the San Antonio Spurs, not  
even suited up for this series because he's not good enough, is a 
silver-haired, 11-time scoring champion and seven-time MVP. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Gaze is a living legend in Australia, a stationary stiff  
in America. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just sort of sitting here, doing my thing,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	During these NBA Finals, which resumed Wednesday night with the  
Spurs leading the New York Knicks 2-1, Gaze is reduced to wearing a 
fancy suit rather than a black-and-silver uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	After appearing in only 19 games during the season and scoring  
21 points, Gaze was left off the playoff roster. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1989, Gaze led Seton Hall within one game of an NCAA  
championship. He was a seldom-used rookie for the Washington 
Bullets in 1993-94. He returned to the NBA when the lockout ended, 
looking for one more NBA paycheck and one more jaunt around the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was a fantastic opportunity at this stage of my  
career,'' he said after the Spurs' shootaround Wednesday. ``If I 
didn't accept it, I would have been kicking myself. Imagine if I 
was sitting home now watching this and saying `That could have been 
me?' Although it was tough to leave my team, it was just too good 
of an opportunity to turn down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gaze was averaging 33.5 points for the Melbourne Tigers of the  
National Basketball League when he left the team to sign with the 
Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	He averaged between 31.5 and 38.7 points during the 11 years he  
led the Australian League in scoring. He also was a four-time 
member of the Australian national team, including the 1996 squad 
that defeated Croatia en route to a fourth-place finish at the 
Atlanta Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The success of that team led to NBA jobs for two Aussies, Shane  
Heal and Mark Bradtke. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradtke spent one season with the Philadelphia 76ers and Heal  
spent one season with the Minnesota Timberwolves. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shane got paid for three, though. He did well,'' Gaze said,  
acknowledging that one of the main attractions of coming to America 
was an NBA-sized paycheck. Gaze signed for one year and $350,000; 
his bonus if the Spurs win the title will be about $90,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it takes some time to adjust,'' he said. ``And a lot  
of players aren't prepared to sit around and do their time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gaze isn't sure of his plans for next season, but he does plan  
to play on the next Australian Olympic team in 2000 when the games 
will be in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from Bradtke and Heal, there will be three members of the  
Aussie team with NBA experience -- Luc Longley of Phoenix, Chris 
Antsey of Dallas and Paul Rogers of Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the first time we'll have size, and a very experienced  
group on our home soil makes for a very good combination,'' Gaze 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another member of that team might be 21-year-old center Matt  
Nielsen, who becomes draft eligible in 2000 and is the most highly 
regarded young player Down Under. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of big kids coming through that are getting some  
attention. There's a lot of talent running around, and because 
culturally we're so similar, a lot of the NBA teams like to recruit 
in Australia,'' Gaze said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a wonderful opportunity to be a part of this for me  
personally, and most of the guys that come here, even though most 
of them haven't gotten to play much, have had very positive 
experiences. There's going to be more to come. The kids in 
Australia aspire to have a chance to play in the NBA.''

<HEADLINE> Matthaeus Says He'll Be a Metrostar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MUNICH, Germany (AP) -- Bayern Munich star Lothar Matthaeus ended  
weeks of speculation Wednesday by saying he will play for Major 
League Soccer's New York MetroStars next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthaeus, 38, a popular figure in German soccer, said he will  
play for Munich next season until the Bundesliga's winter break, 
then join the American league when its season begins. 
</P>
<P>
	An MLS spokesman denied a deal was in the works.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are not in active discussions with Lothar Matthaeus to play  
in Major League Soccer,'' Todd Durbin, the league's vice president 
of player personnel, said. 
</P>
<P>
	``My plan is to quit in winter. In January, take vacation. In  
February, train with Munich. And in March, the season in the United 
States begins,'' Matthaeus told the Bild daily. 
</P>
<P>
	German reports said Matthaeus has signed a contract with the  
MetroStars -- leaving only the date he will join the club open -- and 
will receive $1 million a year. The team's coach, Bora Milutinovic, 
is a personal friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthaeus starred for Germany's 1990 team that won the World  
Cup. While past his prime, he is still a key player on the national 
team and the country's premier club, Bayern Munich.

<HEADLINE> Strawberry's Wife Urges Compassion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Darryl Strawberry's wife asked for compassion  
for her husband, who is serving a drug-related suspension from 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``He got treated very well with having cancer,'' Charisse  
Strawberry said of the empathy shown by fans and the media when the 
New York Yankees outfielder was found to have colon cancer last 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then when you have an addiction problem, or an alcohol  
problem, you get treated bad, and I don't think that's fair. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're both diseases and people need to recognize it ... you  
should be treated with the same respect as you are when you're 
diagnosed with another disease.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charisse Strawberry made her comments in a Daily News interview  
before she spoke Tuesday night at a function benefiting the Long 
Island Council on Alcohol and Drug Dependence, which was started by 
R. Brinkley Smithers, founder of the Smithers Alcohol Treatment 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry and Cleveland Indians pitcher Dwight Gooden were  
among those who have been treated at the center. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry was suspended by commissioner Bud Selig in April  
after being arrested in Tampa, Fla., for cocaine possession and 
soliciting a prostitute. That suspension will end Aug. 11, if not 
sooner. It was his second suspension for violating baseball's 
substance abuse policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Between those suspensions, Strawberry spoke about drug and  
alcohol abuse to fellow recovering addicts at sessions sponsored by 
the Long Island Council.

<HEADLINE> Rockies Co-Owner Arrested For DUI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREELEY, Colo. (AP) -- Charlie Monfort, co-owner of the Colorado  
Rockies, was arrested early Wednesday on drunk driving charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Sgt. John Gates said Monfort's blood-alcohol level was recorded  
at .209 after Monfort was stopped while driving in a residential 
area at about 1 a.m. A blood-alcohol reading of .10 legally is 
considered under the influence in Colorado.

<HEADLINE> White Sox Agree on Ginter Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago White Sox agreed to terms Wednesday  
with right-hander Matt Ginter, one of their two first-round draft 
picks. 
</P>
<P>
	Ginter, 21, went 8-7 with a 4.80 ERA and 108 strikeouts at  
Mississippi State and helped the Bulldogs reach the NCAA Regionals. 
He was the 22nd player taken overall. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Saturday, the White Sox agreed to terms with right-handed  
pitcher Jason Stumm, the team's other first-round pick. Stumm was 
selected 15th overall. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are excited to agree to terms with both of our first-round  
picks,'' White Sox general manager Ron Schueler said. ``We felt it 
was extremely important to have Stumm and Ginter pitching in our 
system this summer. A year of experience can only help their 
development.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White Sox drafted six of the top 33 players in the country  
as rated by Baseball America magazine, choosing 14 pitchers with 
their first 15 picks.

<HEADLINE> Web Sites Look To Entice Shoppers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When shoppers decide where to buy online these  
days, they're not just looking for lower prices or top-notch 
customer service anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans love to get something for nothing, so those Web sites  
offering incentives -- such as free dinners, discount coupons or 
frequent-flier miles -- are enticing many shoppers to keep coming 
back for more. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, a new survey found that nearly 50 percent of shoppers  
said they would be loyal to a Web site if they were rewarded for 
their continued patronage. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great time to be a consumer on the Internet,'' said  
Kate Delhagen, an analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge, 
Mass. ``There is a mad rush to acquire customers on the Web and 
many sites will do anything to get them to stay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With thousands of options to choose from on the Internet, online  
retailers see incentives -- giveaways of something ``extra'' that 
shoppers don't have to pay for -- as an easy way to distinguish 
their site from the next. These E-merchants are taking their cues 
from the success that airlines, credit-card issuers and traditional 
retailers have had with their loyalty programs. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent survey of about 600 people by Total Research Corp.  
found consumers participate in 3.2 loyalty programs on average and 
60 percent said they spend more with the company that offers their 
favorite loyalty program than they did before. 
</P>
<P>
	``The concept of incentives is as old as your grandmother,''  
said Patricia Campbell, head of interactive direct marketing at 
barnesandnoble.com, which offers a variety of rewards. ``Now, 
Internet merchants are taking a traditional model and using it to 
create changes in how consumers spend over a long period of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Internet buying boom only started in the last few  
years, the number of shoppers who say they look for incentives when 
they decide where to buy online mirrors the expectations that they 
have when shopping at traditional retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	A new survey of 1,905 online shoppers found nearly 53 percent  
said that they would buy more if incentives were offered. Only 15 
percent said that rewards would not influence them to make more 
purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, about 47 percent of respondents said they would be  
more loyal to a site that gave rewards, compared with 17 percent 
that wouldn't be wooed for the long-term by incentives. The survey 
was conducted for The Associated Press by the Greenwich, 
Conn.-based Internet research firm NFO Worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Jodi Jill, a literary agent from Boulder, Colo., spent enough on  
the Internet in the last year that it helped her get a free 
round-trip ticket on United Airlines between Denver and Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Imagine that I didn't have to pay for a thing,'' said Jill,  
who frequently shops at barnesandnoble.com and CDNow. ``It was 
free, and most of the miles came from just shopping on the 
Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of Jill's mileage came from ClickRewards, a popular  
incentive program used by more than 40 Internet merchants, 
including E Trade, the Gap.com, Yahoo.com and OfficeMax.com. 
ClickRewards is run by San Francisco-based Netcentives. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of developing their own loyalty programs, many merchants  
are turning to outside companies such as Netcentives and 
MyPoints.com that let consumers shop at an array of sites and pool 
their reward points. These outside programs also appeal to 
merchants because they offer more rewards and a larger customer 
base. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoppers automatically enroll in ClickRewards after purchasing  
something at a member site. They receive a notification e-mail and 
then get points for every dollar spent. 
</P>
<P>
	Some merchants run specials that allow shoppers to get bonus  
points for signing up. For instance, online brokerage firm E Trade 
is offering 25,000 points to anyone who opens an account of $25,000 
or more. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers can trade in their points for a number of rewards. A  
Braun pocket razor takes 1,200 points while a free round-trip 
domestic airline ticket costs 25,000 points. 
</P>
<P>
	While ClickRewards is designed primarily to encourage shoppers  
to keep coming back for more, other programs use rewards as a means 
to collect consumer information and refine their direct-marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	At MyPoints.com, shoppers must first fill out a questionnaire  
containing personal data before they are eligible for any rewards. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on their profiles, MyPoints.com sends e-mails from its 250  
clients -- including Disney, Dell Computer and macys.com -- that best 
suit shoppers' interests. By just opening the e-mails, consumers 
can get points. If they then shop at the site, they are entitled to 
even more. 
</P>
<P>
	Included among the freebies: dinners at Red Lobster, discounts  
on Carnival cruises, free long distance with Sprint and gift 
certificates to retailers such as Target, Sports Authority and 
Sharper Image. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until recently, the focus of the retail community on the  
Internet was acquiring customers, but now it is shifting to `How do 
I get them to stick around?','' said Steve Markowitz, chairman and 
CEO of MyPoints.com, which now has more than 2.5 million consumers 
enrolled in its program. 
</P>
<P>
	While more and more online merchants are stepping up their  
incentives, analysts say that the programs are just getting started 
and shoppers should expect a flood of activity in the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Web sites are expected to start their own programs, while  
more will latch on to the already successful incentives networks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've only seen the beginning of this and in the next few  
years, shoppers will see a barrage of incentives and deals,'' said 
Forrester Research's Delhagen. ``You name it and they'll be giving 
it away.''

<HEADLINE> Lawsuits Against States Are Limited </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- State governments cannot be sued against their  
will in state courts by people seeking to enforce some federal 
right, the Supreme Court said today in a major decision on states' 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
	By a 5-4 vote, the justices killed a state court lawsuit by  
dozens of state probation officers seeking to enforce a federal 
labor law and collect overtime pay from Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	The court ruled that the Constitution's ``structure and  
history'' shields states not only from being sued in federal 
courts, but also makes them immune from individuals' state court 
lawsuits seeking to enforce a federal right. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision leaves Maine's probation officers with a federally  
protected right to be paid for overtime work but with no way to 
enforce that right besides trying to get the federal government to 
sue the state for them. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision continues a recent trend at the nation's highest  
court. In a series of cases decided by 5-4 votes, the justices have 
shown increasing sensitivity to how individual states' authority 
fares when pitted against the federal government's power. 
</P>
<P>
	The conservative coalition of Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist  
and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. 
Kennedy and Clarence Thomas again prevailed today over more liberal 
colleagues, Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Writing for the court today, Kennedy said Congress lacked the  
authority, when enacting the Federal Labor Standards Act of 1938, 
to waive states' sovereign immunity from being sued in state 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress has vast power but not all power,'' Kennedy said.  
``The powers delegated to Congress under the ... Constitution do 
not include the power to subject nonconsenting states to private 
suits for damages in state courts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an extraordinarily lenghty courtroom session in which the  
court closed out its 1998-99 term, Kennedy read portions of his 
51-page opinion, emphasizing the importance of a nation built on 
the idea of two distinct sovereignties -- the federal government and 
the individual states. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress must accord states the esteem due to them as joint  
participants in a federal system,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Souter responded by reading for 14 minutes from his 58-page  
dissenting opinion in words often dripping with sarcasm. ``I expect 
the court's late essay into immunity doctrine will prove the equal 
of its earlier experiment in laissez-faire, the one being as 
unrealistic as the other, as indefensible and probably as 
fleeting,'' Souter said. 
</P>
<P>
	The same 5-4 majority controlled the court in two states'-rights  
rulings in a Florida dispute over that state's business practices. 
</P>
<P>
	In those decisions, the court invoked state sovereign immunity  
to shield Florida from having to defend itself in federal courts 
from lawsuits attacking its program to help families save for the 
cost of the state's public colleges and universities. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuits had alleged that the commercial program violates  
federal patent and trademark laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida's program had been challenged in two separate 1994  
lawsuits by a bank that since 1987 has marketed certificates of 
deposit for financing future costs of education. 
</P>
<P>
	College Savings Bank, based in Princeton, N.J., contended in one  
of its lawsuits that the Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Education 
Expense Board violated the bank's patent for administering its 
CollegeSure CD. 
</P>
<P>
	The other lawsuit accused the state agency of engaging in false  
advertising, a violation of the federal Trademark Remedy 
Clarification Act of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Maine case, the probation officers sued the state in  
federal court in 1992, saying they unfairly were being denied the 
time-and-one-half pay guaranteed by federal law for work over 40 
hours per week. 
</P>
<P>
	While their lawsuit was pending, the Supreme Court ruled in 1996  
that the 11th Amendment shields states from such lawsuits in 
federal courts. So the probation officers refiled their lawsuit in 
a state court, still depending on the federal labor law. 
</P>
<P>
	Maine's courts, however, ruled that the 11th Amendment makes  
states immune from state court lawsuits that would be barred in 
federal courts. Today, the Supreme Court upheld those rulings. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Supreme Court, the probation officers had picked up a  
seemingly powerful ally -- the Clinton administration. When the case 
was argued in March, Solicitor General Seth Waxman urged against 
giving Maine such state court immunity. 
</P>
<P>
	The probation officers also were supported in  
friend-of-the-court briefs submitted by the National Association of 
Police Organizations and a coalition of publishers concerned about 
their right to sue states over alleged copyright infringement. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those supporting Maine in such briefs were 37 other  
states, the National League of Cities, National Association of 
Counties and National Governors' Association. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the two Florida cases, a federal appeals court that  
specializes in technical cases ruled that the patent lawsuit could 
proceed to trial after upholding 1992 amendments to federal 
trademark law in which Congress purportedly subjected states to 
federal lawsuits for infringing someone's patent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court, in an opinion by Rehnquist, reversed that  
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Another federal appeals court doomed the false-advertising  
lawsuit. The Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals 
had struck down the 1992 federal trademark law. The appeals court 
said Congress exceeded its constitutional power in subjecting 
states to being sued in federal court by purportedly interrupting 
their 11th Amendment immunity from federal lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	The highest court, in an opinion by Scalia, upheld that ruling.  
</P>
<P>
	The cases are Alden vs. Maine, 98-436; Florida Prepaid  
Postsecondary Education Expense Board vs. College Savings Bank, 
98-531; and College Savings Bank vs. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary 
Education Expense Board, 98-149.

<HEADLINE> More Charges in School Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- A man accused of selling a handgun that the  
two teen-agers used in the Columbine High School massacre was 
charged Wednesday with an additional count -- possession of a 
sawed-off shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Manes, 22, who was allowed to remain free on bond, also has  
been charged with selling the TEC-DC9 9 mm pistol that Eric Harris 
and Dylan Klebold used to kill 12 students and one teacher. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris and Klebold ended the April 20 rampage by killing  
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest charge against Manes is a felony that carries 1 to 3  
years in prison upon conviction. The TEC-9 charge carries a 
sentence of 2 to 6 years, but could go as high as 12 years if a 
judge finds extraordinary circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	Manes' lawyer, Bob Ransome, said his client has been singled out  
as a scapegoat for the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Ransome said the additional charges were unnecessary and ``it  
seems to be a little bit of overkill to me.''

<HEADLINE>  Spurs Sub Is NBA Finals Spectator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lounging on bench for the San Antonio Spurs, not  
even suited up for this series because he's not good enough, is a 
silver-haired, 11-time scoring champion and seven-time MVP. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Gaze is a living legend in Australia, a stationary stiff  
in America. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just sort of sitting here, doing my thing,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	During these NBA Finals, which resumed Wednesday night with the  
Spurs leading the New York Knicks 2-1, Gaze is reduced to wearing a 
fancy suit rather than a black-and-silver uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	After appearing in only 19 games during the season and scoring  
21 points, Gaze was left off the playoff roster. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1989, Gaze led Seton Hall within one game of an NCAA  
championship. He was a seldom-used rookie for the Washington 
Bullets in 1993-94. He returned to the NBA when the lockout ended, 
looking for one more NBA paycheck and one more jaunt around the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was a fantastic opportunity at this stage of my  
career,'' he said after the Spurs' shootaround Wednesday. ``If I 
didn't accept it, I would have been kicking myself. Imagine if I 
was sitting home now watching this and saying `That could have been 
me?' Although it was tough to leave my team, it was just too good 
of an opportunity to turn down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gaze was averaging 33.5 points for the Melbourne Tigers of the  
National Basketball League when he left the team to sign with the 
Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	He averaged between 31.5 and 38.7 points during the 11 years he  
led the Australian League in scoring. He also was a four-time 
member of the Australian national team, including the 1996 squad 
that defeated Croatia en route to a fourth-place finish at the 
Atlanta Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The success of that team led to NBA jobs for two Aussies, Shane  
Heal and Mark Bradtke. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradtke spent one season with the Philadelphia 76ers and Heal  
spent one season with the Minnesota Timberwolves. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shane got paid for three, though. He did well,'' Gaze said,  
acknowledging that one of the main attractions of coming to America 
was an NBA-sized paycheck. Gaze signed for one year and $350,000; 
his bonus if the Spurs win the title will be about $90,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it takes some time to adjust,'' he said. ``And a lot  
of players aren't prepared to sit around and do their time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gaze isn't sure of his plans for next season, but he does plan  
to play on the next Australian Olympic team in 2000 when the games 
will be in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from Bradtke and Heal, there will be three members of the  
Aussie team with NBA experience -- Luc Longley of Phoenix, Chris 
Antsey of Dallas and Paul Rogers of Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the first time we'll have size, and a very experienced  
group on our home soil makes for a very good combination,'' Gaze 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another member of that team might be 21-year-old center Matt  
Nielsen, who becomes draft eligible in 2000 and is the most highly 
regarded young player Down Under. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of big kids coming through that are getting some  
attention. There's a lot of talent running around, and because 
culturally we're so similar, a lot of the NBA teams like to recruit 
in Australia,'' Gaze said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a wonderful opportunity to be a part of this for me  
personally, and most of the guys that come here, even though most 
of them haven't gotten to play much, have had very positive 
experiences. There's going to be more to come. The kids in 
Australia aspire to have a chance to play in the NBA.''

<HEADLINE> Five Atoms May Be Small-Chip Limit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- There's more room down there at the molecular  
level for computer chip makers than they thought. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Labs scientists say they have found what they believe is  
the limit for making smaller chips using current materials -- five 
atoms. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the minimum thickness needed for the silicon dioxide film  
at the heart of computers to work. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's assuming the film can be made perfectly smooth. For  
practical purposes, the layer would probably have to be about twice 
that thickness to achieve the required smoothness, the scientists 
report in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, the so-called gate oxide films used are about 25  
atoms thick, said Greg Timp, one of the study's authors. 
</P>
<P>
	While the researchers say they believe the five-atom limit is  
dictated by the laws of physics and cannot be overcome, the good 
news is the limit is lower than previously thought. 
</P>
<P>
	So, manufacturers will be able to keep shrinking chips at the  
current rate for 10 to 12 years, instead of six years as some have 
estimated, using current technology, the authors said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an extremely important issue to the semiconductor  
industry,'' Timp said. ``Everyone wants to know how far you can go 
with the current technology because no one wants to spend money to 
rebuild their plants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Johnson, head of the Material Sciences Institute at the  
University of Oregon, said: ``I think they showed that once again 
silicon is going to be around for a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chip makers, who are constantly seeking to make faster, smaller,  
less expensive and more energy-efficient devices, have been told 
before that they would not be able to shrink beneath certain 
limits. 
</P>
<P>
	This time it may be the truth, Max Schulz of the Institute of  
Applied Physics at the University of Erlangen-Nurnberg in Erlangen, 
Germany, wrote in an accompanying commentary. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new limit to thickness is fundamental... and cannot be  
simply overcome by technological improvements,'' Schulz wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Drew Peck, a Boston-based technology analyst for SG Cowen  
Securities, said the increasing cost of building smaller and 
smaller conventional chips will stop their development before 
science runs out of ways to shrink them further. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is it possible to build smaller chips in the laboratory?  
Yes,'' he said. ``Is it possible to build millions of them 
commercially? Possibly not.''

<HEADLINE> Rock Beat: Jimmy Buffett </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- This is no ``Tears of a Clown'' scenario -- not  
by a long shot -- but the musician whom Jimmy Buffett sees in the 
mirror has no party hat. 
</P>
<P>
	The patron saint of Key West has carved out a remarkably  
lucrative career singing tropical-inflected folk songs in sold-out 
arenas to people who, when they close their eyes, pretend they're 
at the beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Buffett is a product of the original sensitive  
singer-songwriter era in the 1970s, and that's still the work to 
which he's drawn. Songs were written then to make people think and 
feel -- not laugh, at least not intentionally. 
</P>
<P>
	His most recent album, ``Beach House on the Moon,'' illustrates  
how he tries to satisfy his fans and his muse. 
</P>
<P>
	It features some of the comical songs his fans, known as  
``parrot heads,'' have come to expect: ``Math Suks,'' a paean to 
the arithmetically challenged by someone plainly deficient in 
spelling, and ``I Will Play for Gumbo.'' The more serious material, 
like the Bruce Cockburn-penned ``Pacing the Cage'' and the title 
cut, is where he really sinks his teeth in. 
</P>
<P>
	``The records are my avenue to go out and do the things I really  
like, which are ballads, (and) to sing things that might not 
necessarily get the crowd in an uproar at the show,'' he said. 
``The magic that goes on in the studio is still the most gratifying 
part.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buffett was as surprised as anyone by the ``parrot head''  
phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 1980s, when he was a decade removed from  
``Margaritaville'' and ``Cheeseburger in Paradise,'' he seemed 
ready to sink toward the obscurity that claims most artists when 
the hits stop. 
</P>
<P>
	He continued to tour, however, and the audiences kept getting  
bigger. They came for a good time, the chance to escape to the 
beach house in their minds. A Buffett concert has its rituals, its 
funny hats, its sing-alongs and, most important, a sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that I've been able to negotiate this with the help  
of a loyal fan base, to be 52 and not be a dinosaur, is a treat,'' 
he said. ``Because the attrition rate is, to say the least, heavy. 
I've never been able to either dissect my music or dissect why 
people come to the show. I'm just glad they do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His tours are among the year's biggest moneymakers, and he has  
built that into a small empire. He owns restaurants, sells 
merchandise like margarita mixes and writes books as well as songs. 
He is one of only six writers to top The New York Times 
best-sellers list for fiction and nonfiction. 
</P>
<P>
	With all of this, his music often gets overlooked. But Buffett's  
not one to complain, just as he knows it's part of his job to play 
``Margaritaville'' every night. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I chose a song list of Jimmy Buffett material that I'd like  
to do in a show, they'd probably start throwing tomatoes by the 
third song,'' he said. ``It would certainly tend to be more of the 
reflective stuff that I've done and that I like personally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He and his band, the Coral Reefers, have a rule: ``Seventy  
percent of the show I call songs you have to do or be killed, and 
you have 30 percent left to work with. That's enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So don't look for any ``unplugged'' tour of weepy material.  
</P>
<P>
	Buffett's new album is the last in a contract with Island  
Records, leaving him a free agent. ``I have a plan,'' he said. 
``Something tells me there's a dot-com in it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's not certain whether that means selling his music solely  
through the Internet, or just in part. At a time of flux in the 
music industry, he has the time and luxury to do pretty much what 
he wants. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a possibility to create something that's beneficial  
not only to me but to other people in the future,'' he said. ``I 
think that people are trying to reinvent the music business right 
now and I'd like to be one of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For too long, the industry has been pouring money into a limited  
number of acts and bypassing a lot of talent, he said. Buffett 
believes that will come back to haunt it. 
</P>
<P>
	In a similar vein, Buffett has created his own Internet radio  
station, hiring some of the people who worked in radio when he was 
getting started in the business. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a connection, a link between the disc jockeys and  
the artists,'' he said. ``I could name the old stations that I used 
to go into -- you hung out with DJs, you talked music. These days, 
that's a rarity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those DJs still exist, but they can't find work in what has  
evolved into the corporate umbrella of radio,'' he said. ``So I've 
kind of located a few of my old friends who are great programmers 
and musicologists and said, `Do shows for me.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Three years after he crashed his plane into Nantucket Harbor and  
nearly died, Buffett is still getting into the cockpit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It changed my life a lot in the fact that I lived through  
it,'' he said. ``I feel like I've gotten a second chance. I have to 
say that I'm more cautious and a better flyer for it.''

<HEADLINE> Defense Dooms Knicks in Game 4 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Knicks finally found their offense,  
only to lose their defense and rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
	All season long, coach Jeff Van Gundy has compensated for a team  
with limited scoring potential by emphasizing other elements of the 
game. ``We are a defensive, rebounding team,'' he often said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Game 4 of the NBA Finals, both those cornerstones deserted  
them and the result was a 96-89 loss to the San Antonio Spurs that 
left New York trailing the best-of-7 series 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Knicks to score 89 points and lose is an indictment of  
their defense, second-best in the league this season. This is a 
team that was averaging 77.7 points per game in this series. The 
Knicks scored 12 points more than that in Game 4 and still lost by 
seven. 
</P>
<P>
	They were beaten off the boards 49-34 and that doomed them.  
</P>
<P>
	``We scored enough points tonight,'' Van Gundy said. ``Points  
was not the problem. The problem tonight was in particular the 
rebounding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much of that occurred in the second half when the Spurs won the  
backboard battle 31-16. 
</P>
<P>
	Marcus Camby, limited by foul trouble through the first three  
games of the series, played 37 minutes and scored 20 points with 13 
rebounds. But he couldn't make much of a dent in San Antonio's 
7-foot twin towers of Tim Duncan and David Robinson, who combined 
for 42 points, 35 rebounds and seven blocked shots. It was just too 
much for the Knicks to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
	``Size does matter in this league,'' Van Gundy said. ``Their  
size beat our speed and quickness tonight because not only did they 
affect us on the boards and in the post scoring, but every 
penetratiom was a difficult, difficult shot because of their shot 
blocking. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew we were going to have to defend and rebound the ball.  
Our rebounding was not nearly goood enough to win a finals game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a night of bad signs for New York and it started early  
when they scored 29 points in the first quarter, surprising offense 
for a team with a reputation for poor shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	But they were trading basket for basket with the Spurs and that  
meant trouble. It was a pace they couldn't keep up. 
</P>
<P>
	By the half, the Spurs had 50 points, hardly the kind of defense  
New York is accustomed to playing. After three quarters, the Knicks 
trailed by nine. They wouldn't score 29 points in a quarter again 
and their defense couldn't get the Spurs under 22. 
</P>
<P>
	New York had been allowing 82.6 points per game in its  
improbable playoff run. That was down from a regular season average 
of 85.4, second in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks didn't get those kind of numbers by allowing teams to  
score 50 points in a half. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with Camby able to stay out of foul trouble and play long  
minutes, the Knicks had no answer inside for Duncan and Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs went on a 9-0 run at the start of the third quarter  
that stunned the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We couldn't buy a shot,'' Camby said. ``We seemed to be  
playing on our heels the rest of the second half.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Knicks are one game away from elimination.  
</P>
<P>
	Latrell Sprewell, who led with New York with 26, tried to stay  
positive. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an opportunity to finish at home with a win for our  
fans -- just to keep hope alive,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Lady At Peace Wins at Hollywodd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Lady At Peace, ridden by Garrett Gomez,  
won a stretch duel with Aviate to take Wednesday's $59,800 feature 
race on the turf at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Lady At Peace opened a slight lead in the final strides and was  
a half-length in front at the wire of the one-mile race for 
3-year-old fillies. 
</P>
<P>
	Pacesetter Inca Tern finished third, another five lengths back  
in the field of five. 
</P>
<P>
	Lady At Peace was timed in 1:34 1-5. Each of the first three  
finishers carried 119 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The 7-5 second wagering choice, Lady At Peace paid $4.80, $2.60  
and $2.10. Aviate, the 13-10 favorite ridden by Chris McCarron, 
returned $2.40 and $2.10. The show payoff on Inca Tern was $2.40. 
</P>
<P>
	The win was the third in seven lifetime starts for Lady At  
Peace, who is trained by David Hofmans.

<HEADLINE> Admin. Touts Cheaper Drug Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. officials are touting what they see as a  
lower cost way to combat South American narcotics smuggling 
compared with a $75 million-a-year operation that had been run out 
of Panama until this past spring. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Panama Canal treaties mandating an end to U.S. military  
presence in Panama, the Clinton administration won permission to 
run drug surveillance flights out of Aruba and Curacao, along the 
northern South American coast, and Ecuador. Talks also are under 
way with the government of an unnamed country in Central America to 
provide another staging area for the flights. 
</P>
<P>
	During its first month of operations in May, officials said the  
surveillance flights led to the forcing down of seven U.S.-bound 
narcotics flights from South America -- exceeding the number for the 
comparable period a year ago when these flights were still operated 
out of Panama. In addition, the operations led to two large 
seizures of cocaine, according to the officials, who asked not to 
be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	But they also acknowledged that reduced U.S. military presence  
has led to an increase in drug smuggling into Panama from 
neighboring Colombia and has emboldened leftist guerrillas from 
Colombia to undertake repeated incursions into Panama. 
</P>
<P>
	The main purpose of the U.S. surveillance flights is to detect  
and track narcotics flights. If a suspect aircraft is spotted over 
Colombia, for instance, authorities from that country are alerted 
and dispatch a plane to force the offending aircraft down. 
</P>
<P>
	While the officials are encouraged by the project thus far, they  
are not ready to declare the experiment a definitive success. 
</P>
<P>
	The Panama Canal treaties don't require the departure of U.S.  
forces until the end of the year, but the phasing out process is 
well under way. Howard Air Force Base, the starting point for 2,000 
surveillance flights annually for many years, essentially went out 
of business in May, although a residual U.S. presence remains. 
</P>
<P>
	House International Relations Committee Chairman Benjamin  
Gilman, R-N.Y., said at a hearing in May that the air base was 
``the crown jewel in our fight against drugs'' and that the 
administration had not done enough to compensate for losing the 
base. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gen. Charles Wilhelm, the ranking U.S. military officer for  
Latin America, testified Tuesday that once the new staging areas 
are ready, surveillance will be 110 per cent of what it was when 
Howard was the base of operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilhelm, testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations  
subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, said it could cost $122 
million to upgrade airports at the staging areas. But he said this 
would be a one-time payment compared with annual $75 million 
outlays at Howard. Another advantage is that local governments pay 
for security. At Howard, this was a U.S. responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Other analysts note that the facilities in Panama were used for  
more than drug surveillance operations. Their mandate included 
search-and-rescue operations and humanitarian relief. Tons of 
supplies were flown from Panama to assist victims of Hurricane 
Mitch in Nicaragua and Honduras last fall. In recent weeks, the 
United States shut down an intelligence gathering facility at 
Galeta Island in Panama and also Fort Sherman, which was used as a 
training facility for almost 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In his testimony, Wilhelm expressed concern about the incursions  
he said Colombian guerrillas have been making into Panama's 
territory. He said Panama's security forces are not ``manned, 
trained or equipped'' to deal with the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Panama does not have a military and relies on a national police  
force for security. He added that the guerrillas have forced some 
Panamanians from their homes in the border area and they also go 
there to rest.

<HEADLINE> Bank President Nabs Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. (AP) -- When two accused check forgers were  
ordered out of a their car and to put their hands on the hood, they 
did as they were told. 
</P>
<P>
	Only later did they learn the demand was barked out not by  
police, but a bank president. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspects pulled into a drive-through lane Tuesday at the  
Williamsport National Bank, where a teller recognized them as 
suspects. 
</P>
<P>
	She contacted President Charles W. Luppert Jr. and another bank  
officer, who jumped into a car and sped two blocks to the bank. 
Their car screeched into the bank driveway, boxing in the suspects. 
</P>
<P>
	Luppert said he got out and screamed at two young men in the  
front seat: ``Get out and put your hands on the hood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They did,'' he said. ``I don't know if they thought we were  
police officers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When a 17-year-old boy in the back didn't get out, he yelled,  
``I'm talking to you, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrived a few minutes later and arrested Thomas  
Kerstetter and Michael Marshallick, both 19, on charges of forgery 
and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Luppert said he had a good reason for making the citizen arrest.

<HEADLINE>  Dow Down 40.21; Nasdaq Up 4.52 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly lower today as persistent  
concerns about interest rates sent bond prices tumbling. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 40.21 at 10,681.42, working its way back from a drop of nearly 
105 points earlier in the session. The blue-chip index lost 94.35 
points Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Nasdaq composite index  
was up 4.52 at 2,584.78. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 
3.39 at 1,332.48. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock and bond markets remained on edge as they awaited the  
Federal Reserve's meeting next week on interest rates. The Fed is 
widely expected to push rates higher in a bid to slow economic 
growth. Market players remain divided, however, on whether the Fed 
will raise rates more than once. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market continues to mark time,'' said Alan Ackerman,  
senior vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. in New York. ``People are 
very conflicted by fear of what the Fed will do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rates rose in the bond market in response to that uncertainty;  
today, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond, which moves in the 
opposite direction to prices, rose to 6.11 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks, which ended a five-session rally on Tuesday,  
appeared vulnerable once more. After the close of trading Tuesday, 
3Com reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that beat 
expectations, but warned that sales of some of its key products may 
slip. Today, 3Com lost 4 to 27 1/2 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the Nasdaq's losses were hemmed in by modest gains from  
major names like Cisco Systems, up 1 1/2 at 61. Also, a new round of 
merger speculation surrounding several smaller Internet players 
stimulated some buying. Earthlink Network rose 4 15/16 to 62 3/16 
amid rumors that it may be acquired by computer maker Gateway. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman Sachs fell 2 13/16 to 65 3/16 after reporting  
second-quarter results that beat analysts' expectations. Goldman 
mirrored the Tuesday performance of rival brokerage Lehman 
Brothers, which fell after announcing strong earnings. Goldman's 
stock rose earlier this week as Wall Street anticipated good 
results, and traders were taking profits today. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks and brokerages were further hampered by the market's  
interest-rate jitters. They are especially vulnerable to higher 
rates, which can discourage borrowers and hurt lending volume. J.P. 
Morgan fell 3 3/4 to 131 1/4, the biggest decliner among Dow components. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by nearly 2-to-1 on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 479.0 million shares, 
slightly behind Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 2.54 at 630.57, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was up 0.25 at 765.72.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Fall for Third Day / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A weak auction of new Treasury debt sent bond  
prices falling for a third straight day Wednesday, pushing 
long-term interest rates farther above 6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 1 1/16  
point, or $10.63 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, a key 
influence on borrowing costs, rose to 6.14 percent from 6.06 
percent late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were unchanged to 3/32 point lower, while intermediate maturities 
fell 3/8 to 23/32 point, reported Bridge Telerate. 
</P>
<P>
	The heavy selling came as the market struggled to absorb $15  
billion in new two-year Treasury notes. The weak demand in 
Wednesday's auction sent yields on two-year notes to the highest 
level in nearly two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds were already struggling this week with no major economic  
data reported to provide new clues on the strength of the economy 
and inflationary pressures. Most observers expect the Federal 
Reserve to nudge interest rates higher at a meeting next week to 
slow the economy and keep a lid on inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading Wednesday, yields on three-month Treasury bills  
were 4.71 percent as the discount fell 0.01 percentage point to 
4.59 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Six-month yields were 5.02 percent, as the discount fell 0.01  
percentage point to 4.83 percent. One-year yields were 5.16 percent 
as the discount rose 0.03 percentage point to 4.90 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 4.69 percent from late Tuesday's 4.63 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 31/32 to 118 28/32. The average yield 
to maturity rose to 5.53 percent, up from late Tuesday's 5.48 
percent.

<HEADLINE> Senate at Standstill Over HMOs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Democrats brought business to a  
standstill, refusing to let a major spending bill move ahead until 
controversial HMO legislation makes its way to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers adjourned Wednesday without reaching an agreement,  
promising to return today for more talks on what Democrats believe 
is a political winner. 
</P>
<P>
	After more than a year of discussion, the Senate has been unable  
to reach agreement on rules for debating the HMO issue -- much less 
the issue itself. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats decided to force the GOP hand this week, refusing  
to act on anything else until they strike a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	A GOP bill, passed out of committee on a party line vote, would  
give modest protections to Americans concerned that health 
maintenance organizations and other managed care plans might skimp 
on care in order to save money. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats are insisting that the Senate consider as many as 20  
amendments, but Republicans want to limit the number of potentially 
difficult votes. 
</P>
<P>
	In the House, Democrats also think they have a winning issue.  
They are collecting signatures on a petition that would force the 
issue, now stalled in committee, to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously we'll try to blame them if it doesn't go,'' said  
Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, work came to a standstill as Democrats refuse to  
allow an agriculture spending bill -- or anything else -- to move 
ahead until the two parties reach an agreement on patients' rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats framed the debate in the most personal and sympathetic  
of terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every child with cancer deserves access to a pediatric  
oncologist,'' said Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Barbara Milkulski, D-Md., described her gall bladder  
surgery, lamenting that while she could stay in the hospital 
overnight, some women who have mastectomies cannot. 
</P>
<P>
	It is not easy to argue against these stories, GOP leaders  
acknowledge. So Republicans are trying to avoid taking votes ``that 
can be misconstrued for political purposes,'' said Sen. Don 
Nickles, R-Okla., the No. 2 Republican in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Nickles repeatedly cited a Congressional Budget Office estimate  
that the Democratic bill would increase the cost of health 
insurance by 4.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls show overwhelming majorities want new laws, but support  
drops when people are told it will cost money and force employers 
to drop coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican strategy has been to offer modest legislation to  
address consumer fears that health maintenance organizations and 
other managed care plans skimp on care to save money. Their 
proposals do not allow new lawsuits, for instance, and they let 
insurance companies keep ultimate authority to decide what care is 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither side seems interested in finding common ground, said  
Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, an 
independent health research group that has done extensive polling 
on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question they could reach a compromise here on a  
package of things that would ... greatly satisfy the American 
people,'' Altman said. ``There's every prospect Congress will blow 
the opportunity.''

<HEADLINE> Jays' Tony Fernandez Is Aging Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Tony Fernandez treats the subject of hitting .400  
the same way he handles a curveball in the dirt. 
</P>
<P>
	He won't bite. Not even a bit.  
</P>
<P>
	``Talk to me about that in September,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Then again, the Toronto Blue Jays' third baseman is going to  
have a hard time avoiding the topic at this rate. A few days short 
of his 37th birthday, he was batting .411 going into Wednesday 
night's game against Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Ted Williams was the last player to reach the magic mark,  
hitting .406 in 1941. Tony Gwynn came close in 1994, finishing at 
.394 in the strike-shortened season. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Larry Walker was at .411 in mid-July before falling  
off. In 1993, John Olerud was at .402 on Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, Fernandez visited with Olerud when Toronto played  
the New York Mets at Shea Stadium. So, did the former Blue Jays 
teammates talk about hitting .400? 
</P>
<P>
	``No, mostly we laughed a lot,'' Fernandez said.  
</P>
<P>
	It's already been a memorable season for the Blue Jays' career  
hits leader. 
</P>
<P>
	He got the first five-hit game of his career. He batted cleanup  
for the first time in the majors. He passed Julio Franco for the 
most hits by a Dominican-born player, getting No. 2,178 with a 
two-out, game-winning single in the bottom of the ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Fernandez has come through in the clutch so often his  
Toronto teammates have nicknamed him ``Two-out Tony.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Going into this week, he was hitting .473 with runners in  
scoring position, including .405 with two outs. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the game is on the line, opposing managers hate to see  
Tony come to the plate,'' Toronto hitting coach Gary Matthews said. 
``One out, two outs, he's going to give you a good at-bat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez attributes his success to a strong work ethic and  
religious faith. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've said all along it's been a blessed year for me. I believe  
that my Lord has given me the strength and he wanted to bless me 
with this kind of year,'' Fernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps it's a reward for all the time he spent in the offseason  
distributing supplies and clothing around the Dominican Republic, 
which was devastated by Hurricane Georges. 
</P>
<P>
	More likely it's because of his training regimen.  
</P>
<P>
	Before every game, Fernandez stretches, hits off a tee, takes  
batting practice, works out with a medicine ball and hits from a 
cage under the stands. After every game, he lifts weights for 30 to 
40 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a lot stronger than I use to be,'' Fernandez said as he  
changed into his workout gear. ``Ten years ago teams didn't have 
strength and condition coaches. Now they do, so that's helped me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Jim Fregosi said Fernandez is the hardest-working player  
he's ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
	``This guy is a marvel,'' Fregosi said. ``He's played a lot of  
games. When I was 37, I was done. D-U-N.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Back in 1997, there were some in baseball who wondered whether  
Fernandez was close to being done. His error at second base on a 
routine grounder set up Florida's winning run against Cleveland in 
Game 7 of the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	To see him these days, though, Fernandez looks in top shape.  
</P>
<P>
	``You have to do a lot of work,'' Fernandez said earlier this  
season. ``It's a new challenge every year. Your body doesn't 
respond the same so you have to work harder and harder to keep up 
with these young guys. It's the only way to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez chatted for just a few moments that night and then was  
off to the gym. 
</P>
<P>
	He may not have time to talk to reporters about .400, but he  
isn't too busy to meet his fans. 
</P>
<P>
	A 92-year-old grandmother, named ``Grammom'' Francis Elliott,  
got to meet her idol before a game last week. The two spoke for 15 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got to be real friends, he called me `Grammom' and signed  
my ball,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez was all smiles that day, but he's also known for his  
mood swings. 
</P>
<P>
	When a heckling fan bothered him in spring training, an enraged  
Fernandez went into the stands and tried to confront him. Fregosi 
and pitching coach Mel Queen had to restrain him. 
</P>
<P>
	When Shawn Green couldn't play this month because of a broken  
wrist, Fregosi moved Fernandez into the cleanup spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever you're going to ask, I don't know, I don't know, I  
don't know,'' Fernandez said after the game. ``I'm confused. I 
don't know what's going on. I haven't talked to Fregosi. Obviously, 
it doesn't matter what I think. No one asks me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Come September, however, a lot of people might have a lot of  
things to ask ``Two-out Tony.''

<HEADLINE> Computers Finally Get Slimmer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The bulky, beige personal computer is going on a  
diet. Thanks to ever-shrinking components, manufacturers are 
introducing thinner machines with flat-panel screens that save desk 
space for coffee mugs and family photos. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that your average clunker, which costs less than the svelte  
newcomers, is going away soon. But the arrivals, on display Tuesday 
at the PC Expo trade show here, signal an important deviation from 
the desktops that have cramped workspace and depressed office 
ambiance for nearly two decades. Now, you can buy a well-equipped 
PC for $2,000 that takes up one-quarter the space. 
</P>
<P>
	The unconventional designs, from Sony, Gateway, Packard Bell NEC  
and others, take their cue from Apple Computer's iMac, which shook 
up the world of desktops since its launch last summer. Apple's 
highly popular machine is shaped like a giant jelly bean, equipped 
with a built-in monitor, and comes in five translucent colors 
through which inner circuitry is faintly visible. 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike the iMac, which starts at $900, the new futuristic  
machines cost more than twice as much and are aimed at a smaller 
niche of buyers. The main reason is their space-saving flat-panel 
screens, which use liquid crystal instead of electron beams to show 
data and images and cost four times as much as conventional 
monitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``They look great, but they add a significant chunk to the  
overall price of the system,'' said Tom Rhinelander, an industry 
analyst with Forrester Research, a Boston-based high-tech 
consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Gateway's new Profile computer, which starts at $1,999 and is  
just 3 inches thick, looks like it's missing something from the 
back. Yet crammed against the thin monitor is a 400-megahertz AMD 
microprocessor, 64-megabytes of memory, a 4.3-gigabyte hard drive 
and sockets for attachments. 
</P>
<P>
	A comparably equipped Gateway of the bulkier variety costs  
$1,317. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a nice slim unit. We would recommend it to customers,''  
said salesman Gary Paraschak of the Waytek computer distributor in 
Voorhees, N.J., who was checking out the PC Expo exhibits for 
products to sell to retail stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Saving room ``is a real big issue because office space is  
expensive,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's got a possibility,'' said a more skeptical Catherine  
Miller of Cigna Corp., who advises the big insurance company on 
computer purchases. She was concerned that employees used to 
conventional monitors might have a hard time adjusting to the new 
screens. 
</P>
<P>
	``The visibility is just OK,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Sony's new Vaio Slimtop LCD computer also features a sliver of a  
monitor. But unlike Gateway, Sony packed its vital circuitry into a 
separate box the size of a hard-cover dictionary -- about one-third 
the dimensions of a conventional computer tower. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vaio Slimtop, available in lavendar-gray, sports an  
innovativekeyboard with a dust cover that slides out to convert 
into a palm rest. Prices start at $2,299 for a machine equipped 
with a 400-megahertz Pentium II, and $2,999 for a version with a 
500-megahertz Pentium III. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony officials said the Slimtops, announced earlier this year,  
are aimed at such space-conscious buyers such as Wall Street firms, 
where financial traders' desks typically are crammed with up to six 
monitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Packard Bell NEC, owned by NEC Corp. and Groupe Bull, last week  
rolled out its Z1 desktop, a $2,500 desktop that fits its important 
components into the back of a flat-screen monitor. It also includes 
a wireless keyboard that no longer tethers users to the desktop. At 
the PC Expo show, the company displayed a slim computer designed 
for business use, costing $2,400 and up. 
</P>
<P>
	Like its slim rivals, the Z1 uses many Packard Bell parts that  
were originally made for laptops, enabling the feat of desktop 
miniaturization. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically it is a notebook in desktop clothing,'' said Michael  
DeNeffe, Packard Bell's product manager for laptops.

<HEADLINE> Toyota May Expand in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Toyota Motor Corp. is still studying the possible  
expansion of its production capacity in North America as part of 
its plan to sell 1.5 million cars and trucks annually in the United 
States, a spokeswoman said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been no final decisions,'' said Barbara McDaniel of  
Toyota Motor Manufacturing North American Inc. in Cincinnati. 
``There is no preferred location decided right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota President Hiroshi Okuda said in April that the automaker  
was looking at expansion options, including adding another assembly 
line to Toyota's pickup truck plant in Princeton, Ind., or 
expanding its car plant in Cambridge, Ontario. A decision is 
expected by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	McDaniel said the continuing strong demand for Toyota's North  
American vehicles is driving the expansion study. Toyota can 
produce 1.2 million vehicles annually in North American and expects 
continued strong demand will require expansion to 1.5 million 
vehicles in the next several years, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new $1.2 billion Indiana plant may be the most likely  
candidate for expansion because it produces light trucks, the 
fastest-growing segment of the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
	Princeton recently began production of the Tundra, Toyota's  
second effort at a full-size pickup, and early sales have been 
unusually strong. Toyota also announced in March that it plans to 
build a sport utility vehicle there based on the Tundra chassis 
starting in fall 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Should demand for the pickup remain strong, Toyota may most need  
to expand capacity at Princeton to fill orders for the new SUV. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cambridge plant makes the Toyota Corolla subcompact and the  
Camry Solara coupe. Toyota also has plants in Georgetown, Ky., 
which makes the Camry and Avalon sedans, and in Fremont, Calif., 
where it produces Corollas and Tacoma compact pickups. The Fremont 
plant is jointly operated by General Motors Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first five months of this year, Toyota's U.S. sales were  
up 13 percent over the same period of 1998 while industrywide sales 
were up 8 percent.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Urged To Free Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- An international human rights group  
on Wednesday urged Yugoslavia to release all political prisoners 
and suspend restrictive measures introduced during the 78-day NATO 
bombardment. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia declared a state of war after NATO launched  
airstrikes on March 24 to force President Slobodan Milosevic to 
sign a peace agreement for the Serbian province of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Citizens' rights have been severely curtailed by restrictions  
decreed under the state of war which effectively stifled dissenting 
voices in the country,'' said an Amnesty International statement 
faxed to The Associated Press in Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	International observers estimate 2,000 political prisoners,  
mostly ethnic Albanians, remain in Serb custody. 
</P>
<P>
	The London-based organization said people have been detained for  
expressing dissenting views, refusing military service, and taking 
part in protests. Two Kosovo Serb refugees were recently sentenced 
to 30 days in prison for holding a public protest. 
</P>
<P>
	Parliament is scheduled to vote Thursday to end the state of  
war, but state-run media has reported several new laws will be 
discussed. The reports suggested a possible attempt to prolong or 
impose new restrictive measures, even after lifting the state of 
war. 
</P>
<P>
	Amnesty also appealed to Milosevic to provide the whereabouts of  
all political prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	After Milosevic accepted a peace plan and withdrew his troops  
from Kosovo, most prisons in the province were emptied and inmates 
transferred to other parts of Serbia, the dominant republic in 
Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Bush Urges Local Control of Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush today declined  
to make abortion a litmus test for a running mate if he wins the 
Republican presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked by a reporter if he could accept a running mate who  
believes women should have a right to choose an abortion, Bush 
answered that his ``first criteria for a running mate is: Can that 
person be president?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously I would want to know if the person will help the  
ticket,'' Bush said. But he added, ``I think it's a little 
presumptuous for somebody who doesn't even have the nomination to 
talk about a running mate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GOP rival Gary Bauer seized on Bush's non-comment to criticize  
him for refusing to exclude as possible running mates anyone who 
supports a woman's right to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he were truly pro-life, he would rule out selecting a  
running mate who will not defend innocent children,'' Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has taken the same position when asked if abortion would be  
an issue in picking Supreme Court nominees, saying ``there will be 
no litmus tests, except for whether or not the judges strictly 
interpret the Constitution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The son of former President George Bush has said he opposes  
abortion and would support a constitutional amendment making the 
procedure illegal -- except in cases of rape, incest and when a 
woman's life is jeopardy. But he also has said Americans don't 
support the measure and he, thus, sees no need to pursue it. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning a two-day fund-raising trip around Pennsylvania, Bush  
espoused giving state and local governments more control over 
education, including curriculum, disciplining students and 
punishing juvenile offenders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trust local people to make decisions for their schools,'' said  
Bush, who has 17-year-old twin daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke to about 120 business people at a $1,000-a-plate lunch.  
Bush hoped to raise $700,000 at the Bethlehem event and subsequent 
events in Philadelphia, Harrisburg and Pittsburgh. 
</P>

	Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge introduced Bush as ``my good  
friend'' and ``my friend from Texas.'' Bush returned the favor, 
calling Ridge a ``good buddy'' and ``one of the best governors in 
all of America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ridge was accompanying accompany Bush during his Pennsylvania  
campaign, which includes a scheduled breakfast Thursday in 
Harrisburg and a luncheon in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	After leaving Bethlehem, Bush and Ridge spoke about the  
importance of education to 40 elementary-aged students in the 
library at the Visitation BVM School in Philadelphia. Just a few 
children raised their hands when Bush asked how many of them read 
more than they watched TV. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you can read, you can learn. And if you learn a lot, you  
can realize your dreams in this country,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	After a student asked him a question in Spanish, Bush rattled an  
answer back without taking a breath. 
</P>
<P>
	``She asked if I could speak Spanish. As she can tell, not very  
well,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Bethlehem, Bush didn't mention either President Clinton or  
Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential front-runner, 
but made veiled jabs at both. ``I will not use my office as a 
mirror to reflect public opinion,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a proposal eerily similar to his father's ``thousand points  
of light,'' Bush championed an ``army of compassion.'' These 
private-sector ``compassion soldiers'' would offer help to unwed 
mothers or job training to welfare recipients with economic 
incentives but no direct aid from the government, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Government cannot put a sense of purpose in our lives. ...  
Government can rally the armies of compassion to make sure no one 
is left behind,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	After Bush's 25-minute speech, supporters compared him to his  
father. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a much better campaigner than his father,'' said  
Bethlehem marketing consultant Bill Maier. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorothy Baker said the trip was a good start, but Bush still has  
a long way to go. 
</P>
<P>
	``It depends on who he gets as his running mate. You've got to  
get somebody strong,'' said Mrs. Baker.
