OFFENSE WAKES UP FOR CLOSER
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With the bulldozers warming up in the parking lot,
the Los Angeles Dodgers refused to throw any more dirt on
themselves during Sunday's final home game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   They know the winter will be busy, but they also wanted to send
the fans off with a smile. By beating San Diego 10-7 in front of
46,177 on Fan Appreciation Day at Dodger Stadium, they accomplished
that for one afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   It started before the game when Dodgers players stood at the
entrances to greet fans. Some fans were angry at the club's poor
showing (74-82), some thanked the players for a ``memorable''
season. In all, 3,095,345 fans watched the club this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``One guy just thought I was someone just standing around in a
blue shirt,'' said first baseman Eric Karros, who later tied a
career high with his 34th homer. ``One Padres fan said, `See you in
San Diego next year.' But I think most of them knew there was no
one more frustrated about this year than us.''
</P>
<P>
   One example of the Dodgers too-little, too-late season was the
power surge Sunday by Karros, Gary Sheffield and Raul Mondesi. Each
hit homers, just the second time that has happened this season.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Karros, Sheffield hit his 31st home run and
second in two games. It gave him 37 RBI in his last 34 games.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi's was a two-run shot in the fourth inning that gave
Dodgers rookie left-hander Jeff Williams a 4-1 lead. Williams
couldn't hold it, giving up a game-tying home run to Reggie Sanders
in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   But for Mondesi, the afternoon was significant. He now has 32
homers and 92 RBI, both career highs. He also has 33 stolen bases.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe just as important? The boos, which hounded Mondesi
after his profanity-laced tirade last month in Montreal, have
subsided. Fans gave him Sunday's loudest cheers when he reached
home plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is good to see Mondy go out on a high note,'' said manger
Davey Johnson, whose club moved past San Diego into third place in
the NL West. ``It has been a long season for him, but he is showing
just the kind of player he is. We can all carry a good thought into
the offseason.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi, who has two years and $20.5 million left on his
contract, could be traded during the offseason. So could Karros,
who will make $5 million in 2000, the final year in his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Karros' home run, the highlight of a six-run seventh, was the
211th of his career, tying him with Steve Garvey for second place
and moving him within 17 of Ron Cey's all-time L.A. record. His 112
RBI also are a season high.
</P>
<P>
   Two players who were not in the starting lineup, Eric Young and
Devon White, might be elsewhere next season even though they have
years remaining on their contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, the Dodgers have $66 million in guaranteed contracts
for next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be plenty of time to think about all that, but I
like a lot of the pieces we have here right now,'' Johnson said.
``It just felt good to send the fans home a winner.''

IBANEZ HOMER IN NINTH SINKS ANGELS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ With one swing, it was over for the Mariners _ the
game, the first tour of Safeco Field, and possibly a last look at
Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez as teammates in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Ibanez pulled the curtain, smacking a leadoff home run in
the bottom of the ninth inning Sunday to beat the Anaheim Angels,
3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was time to pack up the club and send it on to Texas,
Oakland and points unknown.
</P>
<P>
   After socking his game-winner, Ibanez stood in the clubhouse,
beamed over his good fortune and spoke of the future. At opposite
ends, Griffey and Rodriguez shrugged off possibilities beyond the
coming week, one cracking jokes, the other maintaining a stoic
posture, in the face of uncertainty over impending contract
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when you know when you're out of here, is when people
start asking for things _ `Hey, you all need those spikes?' ''
quipped Griffey, who sat in his white Mariners uniform for the
longest time before showering, addressing a steady stream of
well-wishers and reporters.
</P>
<P>
   It was a stirring end to an emotional afternoon, one witnessed
by a crowd of 44,485 _ the Mariners' 30th sellout in 42 games at
Safeco Field, where they won 23 games. The club drew 1,816,504 fans
to the new ballpark and 2,960,803 counting Kingdome games,
averaging 43,250 at Safeco, 36,010 overall.
</P>
<P>
   Most were left wondering if they have to wait until the 2001
All-Star game to see Griffey and Rodriguez together again.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Seattle's superstars went hitless, though each provided
a run. They deferred lead roles to players in search of steady
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Capping his first full big league season in a big way, Ibanez
hit the first pitch to him by Shigetoshi Hasegawa into the
right-field seats for his seventh homer, 361 feet away. That gave
the Mariners a club-record 18 consecutive games with a long ball,
and third game-ender.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking about laying down a bunt,'' Ibanez said.
</P>
<P>
   His heroics made a winner out of hard-throwing reliever Tom
Davey (2-1), one of four rookies sent to the mound in a close game.
Davey did something virtually unheard of for a Mariners pitcher
since Randy Johnson left town _ he struck out the side in the top
of the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   He succeeded Sinclair, who was as stubborn as Davey was
overpowering. The lefty entered in the seventh inning with a runner
on third and one out. Sinclair, acquired from Toronto with Davey in
a midseason traded for first baseman David Segui, fell behind Todd
Greene 3-and-1, battled him until he struck out the pinch-hitter
with his 11th pitch, then got an inning-ending grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Their efforts came after starter Robert Ramsay gave a clear
indication of his promise. Ramsay retired the first eight batters
he faced and permitted just five hits and two runs in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   As the pitching slowly falls into place for the Mariners, they
are left to ponder whether their big bats will be around to back
it.
</P>
<P>
   With no veto power over his trade prospects, Rodriguez said
there is ``obvious doubt'' whether he will return.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a situation like this, I have to expect the very worst,''
the shortstop said. ``I can't sit back and think it's pretty as
pink. The Mariners have to go out and make a shrewd business
decision. It will be interesting. I love Seattle, but I love
winning a little more.''
</P>
<P>
   If the decision is left in his hands, Rodriguez says he will be
in no hurry to determine his future, whether to re-sign with the
M's or choose another team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to wait and see,'' he said. ``There's no timetable.
I could wait until after the year 2000 to make a decision if I have
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, who has the right to nix any deal, was evasive about
his plans, other than to indicate that he is in full control of the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my decision,'' he said. ``I'm going to talk it over with
my wife. It's cut and dried. First I'm going to play golf. When I
make up my mind, I make up my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   If only everything could be as easy as a Raul Ibanez homer.

EFFORTS BLOTTED OUT BY ERRORS
</HEADLINE>

By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC had just finished its triple overtime thriller
with Oregon, and around midnight Saturday coach Paul Hackett
finally emerged from the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   He might have commented on the drama of Oregon's 33-30 victory
at Autzen Stadium. Or the courageous effort of quarterback Mike Van
Raaphorst filling in for the injured Carson Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   But Hackett couldn't hide his bitter disappointment over the
errors USC committed, with a school-record 21 penalties, the most
in a Pacific-10 Conference game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a very good football team right now,'' Hackett said.
``We're back to square one. We are nowhere right now. We
self-destructed at every turn. We lost every opportunity under the
sun. It's disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mistakes were everywhere. When you have mistakes and
penalties, it just dulls some wonderful efforts by the receiver
corps and defensive line. We wasted a hell of an effort by Mike Van
Raaphorst.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett's frustration centered on some critical moments that
probably cost USC the game.
</P>
<P>
   __ USC was called for unsportsmanlike conduct after scoring the
go-ahead touchdown to take a 23-20 lead with 3:08 remaining.
Offensive lineman Faasea Mailo took off his helmet _ a violation of
NCAA rules _ and drew the penalty.
</P>
<P>
   That meant a routine extra point suddenly was kicked 15 yards
farther back, and a bad snap sailed through holder John Fox's
hands.
</P>
<P>
   Mailo, who was a Mormon missionary for two years, was not even
aware he broke a rule by removing his helmet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I've been away from the game too long,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   __ The Trojans seemed to have the game sealed after the botched
extra point, when Troy Polamalu forced a fumble on the ensuing
kickoff, and Aaron Graham recovered to give USC the ball at the
Oregon 22 with 2:59 left.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Morton then scored on a sweep play, but the touchdown was
called back on a holding penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The holding penalty on the touchdown was a shame,'' Hackett
said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Note: Hackett said Sunday he will cut the time of players who
have been committing penalties, by rotating in some reserves this
week. He didn't identify which positions are affected. Fullback
Charlie Landrigan will start in place of Brennan Ochs this week. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
REPORT CARD &QL; 
__ GAME: 3 &QL; 
__ RESULT: Oregon 33, USC 30 &QL; 
__ RECORD: 2-1, 0-1 &QL; 
__ THIS WEEK'S GPA: 2.38 &QL; 
__ CUMULATIVE GPA: 2.84 &QL; 
__ NEXT GAME: Oregon State &QL; 
QUARTERBACKS &QL; 
Mike Van Raaphorst deserved a purple heart in relief. Will Carson
Palmer even want his redshirt year? What's Jason Thomas' phone
number? &QL; 
B+ &QL; 
RUNNING BACKS &QL; 
Does anyone else think Chad Morton has lost a step? Sultan
McCullough is apparently being saved for track season. &QL; 
D+ &QL; 
RECEIVERS &QL; 
R. Jay Soward was reintroduced to the offense and it paid off
nicely. Steve Stevenson showed promise with his two receptions
before being hurt. &QL; 
A &QL; 
OFFENSIVE LINE &QL; 
The good: Pass protection of Van Raaphorst was impressive. The bad:
Nonexistent run blocking and six false starts. &QL; 
C &QL; 
DEFENSIVE LINE &QL; 
The unsung heroes of the team. Ryan Nielsen has an NFL future and
is USC's most improved player. Ennis Davis had his best game of the
season. &QL; 
A- &QL; 
LINEBACKERS &QL; 
Markus Steele had 16 tackles and Zeke Moreno 13 in two courageous
efforts. The strongside position seems to be the weak link. &QL; 
B+ &QL; 
DEFENSIVE BACKS &QL; 
They did a nice job holding down Oregon's receivers _ by the
jersey, the arm or any other means you could think of. &QL; 
D+ &QL; 
SPECIAL TEAMS &QL; 
Yikes! Three missed field goals are one thing, but when did
snapping the ball become so difficult? &QL; 
D &QL; 
COACHING &QL; 
It was a memorable game, but someone has to take the blame for 21
penalties. That's 47 in three games, for those keeping score at
home. &QL;

AS NEXT ONE GOES, SO GOES THE SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A warm, thick air of disappointment enveloped
UCLA's locker room on the southeast corner of Stanford Stadium. But
beneath the obvious angst was a faint optimism _ barely detectable
in the Bruins' quiet voices and hollow eyes _ that the disparate
parts have almost congealed.
</P>
<P>
   It was an appropriate tone. With seven games remaining and a
road trip to Arizona State fast approaching, the Bruins (2-2
overall, 0-1 Pac-10) on are the brink.
</P>
<P>
   On one side lies quality. On the other, mediocrity. Which way
they fall _ what kind of season this becomes _ depends heavily on
their performance this week.
</P>
<P>
   Beat the Sun Devils, who are equally desperate, and seven or
eight wins are within reach. Lose, and the Bruins are suddenly
staring at 6-5 or worse.
</P>
<P>
   Why this week? UCLA is the only team with its first two league
games on the road, but the difficult early schedule turns favorable
in mid-October, with four of the final six at home. If the Bruins
can survive until the homestand, they'll have a chance to refuel.
</P>
<P>
   There were traces of a turnaround in UCLA's 42-32 loss Saturday
in Stanford Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Tailback DeShaun Foster played his best game and the Bruins ran
effectively for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive line had fewer breakdowns in communication and
execution. (If injured guard Mike Saffer returns this week, as he
expects, watch for exponential improvement.)
</P>
<P>
   And receiver Danny Farmer survived without aggravating his
tender ankle, although he did not catch a pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's frustrating is that I see so much promise in this team
offensively,'' offensive coordinator Al Borges said. ``We're young
and that's not an excuse, it's a reason. Sometimes we don't take
advantage of our opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   That failure falls mostly on the quarterback. Either starter
Cory Paus must return quickly (and effectively) from bruised ribs
or temporary starter Drew Bennett must improve his downfield
passing.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett has average velocity and rarely throws tight spirals,
but his arm isn't the issue. This is about his head _ about
recognizing defenses, about spotting open receivers and about
delivering the ball quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Bennett either threw late or missed open receivers
altogether. Consequently, he stripped UCLA of its most effective
weapon. While Stanford has a stingy run defense, the Cardinal
secondary is slow and suspect. Opponents had thrown for 332 yards a
game, but UCLA managed only a paltry 207.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Bennett) didn't throw it as well as he needs to throw it to
win big games,'' UCLA coach Bob Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same dilemma on defense. The Bruins have improved their
run containment, their pass rush is emerging, and they've
assimilated the suspended players. They're close to becoming an
effective unit _ except for the secondary, which is a mess.
</P>
<P>
   There's no easy solution.
</P>
<P>
   Freshmen cornerbacks Ricky Manning and Joe Hunter aren't
suddenly going to play like seniors.
</P>
<P>
   Senior safeties Joey Strycula and Eric Whitfield aren't going to
become all-conference players this week.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Jason Bell's heel might heal, but he has missed two
games and won't be in top form by Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   And two players are not performing to their talent or experience
levels: sophomore safety Jason Stephens, who has been benched, and
senior safety/ cornerback Ryan Roques.
</P>
<P>
   Yardage itself isn't the issue. UCLA dares opponents to move
five yards per play for 80 yards, because few college offenses can
do it series after series. But when the Bruins yield yards in
chunks, as they did Saturday, it's a problem not easily overcome.
</P>
<P>
   `I'm not going to let this get us down,'' defensive coordinator
Bob Field said. ``It's about the way you practice. We have to
hammer it. We have to harp on it. We have to demand it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a very good job on it in spring practice and a very
good job in fall camp. But for whatever reason, (Saturday) we went
back to square one.''

 By TERRY BLOUNT  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Paul Tracy was the Team Kool Green goat last year at Houston
because of a collision that almost cost teammate Dario Franchitti a
victory.
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Tracy looked at the gold cowboy boot Sunday that was his
trophy for winning the second Texaco/Havoline Grand Prix of
Houston, he remembered that frustrating mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to be holding this boot in my hand instead of having
it up my butt,'' Tracy said.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy didn't make any mistakes this year, finishing more than 13
seconds ahead of Franchitti to win the downtown street race and
make Team Kool Green undefeated in two trips to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   It also was a good day for the Newman/Haas team of Michael
Andretti and Christian Fittipaldi, who finished third and seventh,
respectively, in the race that bears the name of their team
sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Tracy's day of redemption, and the only thing that
was going to keep the 30-year-old Canadian from winning Sunday was
a possible team order to let Franchitti move ahead of him to take
the checkered flag.
</P>
<P>
   Franchitti is battling Juan Montoya for the 1999 CART FedEx
championship, and he could have gained an additional four points by
finishing first Sunday. Team owner Barry Green considered giving
the order to have Tracy let Franchitti go by, but Green decided
against it with three laps to go in the 100-lap event.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I just hope we don't lose (the championship) by four
points,'' Green said. ``But Paul worked so hard. He deserved it.''
</P>
<P>
   Franchitti had no problem with the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been different if I had been right on Paul's
gearbox,'' he said. ``Paul was dominating the race. There was no
way we should do anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracy was asked what he would have done had Green asked him to
let Franchitti win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I would have said (simulating a static sound), `Sorry,
I can't hear you,''' Tracy joked.
</P>
<P>
   It still was a good day for Franchitti, who gained 16 points on
Montoya and pulled within 13 points of the top spot in the
championship chase with two races remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``This certainly helps things,'' said Franchitti. ``It's not
over yet. Things are looking a lot better than they did last week.
It's going to be interesting now.''
</P>
<P>
   Any chance Montoya had of clinching the FedEx championship came
to an end on lap 13 when the crowd of 45,000 watched him crash into
the stalled car of Helio Castro-Neves.
</P>
<P>
   Montoya, who started on the pole, was leading the race and
turning onto the frontstretch when he couldn't avoid Castro-Neves,
who had slid into a tire barrier on Turn 10 a few seconds earlier.
</P>
<P>
   A full-course yellow came out a couple of seconds before Montoya
reached Turn 10, but it was too late. Montoya's right front tire
slammed into the left rear tire of Castro-Neves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a miscommunication,'' Montoya said. ``It has
happened before, and it will happen again. Nobody told me there was
an incident there. Nobody told me anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me there was a yellow, but I didn't know where. I
backed off, but the (Castro-Neves) car was right in the middle of
the track. I tried to hit the brakes and make the turn, but I
couldn't. It's really disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Montoya, Tracy said he was aware of trouble ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew exactly where the car (of Castro-Neves) was,'' Tracy
said. ``They told me on the radio, and I already had begun to slow
down when I saw Juan hit him. I managed to get around both of them,
and then I told myself, `OK, now don't make any mistakes.'''
</P>
<P>
   Castro-Neves seemed more upset that he had caused Montoya to
crash than he was about his own car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was waiting for someone to hit me, because it was a bad
spot,'' Castro-Neves said. ``But the last one I wanted to hit me
was Juan. I'm so sorry. It was my mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``All weekend I was using second gear (on the turns), but
because the pace was so slow, I was using first gear. When I went
into Turn 10, I forgot and left it in second and went straight into
the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracy knows the feeling. He was running second behind Franchitti
last year in Houston when the two cars collided, ending the day for
Tracy.
</P>
<P>
   Green was furious with Tracy for hitting Franchitti in an overly
aggressive move that could have cost Franchitti the race in the
rain-shortened event.
</P>
<P>
   That incident was one of the reasons Tracy was suspended from
the first race of the 1999 season, but he has managed to overcome
that handicap and have one of the best seasons of his career.
</P>
<P>
   With his second victory of the year, Tracy ranks third in the
points standings despite having sat out the first event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really feel redeemed by this,'' Tracy said. ``I feel
like I put in a lot of hard work and a lot of effort, both mentally
and physically over the winter, to do the things I needed to do to
turn my career around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've let go a lot of mental issues that I needed to let go.
It's enabled me to drive better and concentrate on moving
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracy took a big step forward Sunday by erasing a ghost from the
past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to say any place owes me one, but I got it right this
year,'' Tracy said. ``I think I've matured a lot as a racer, and it
shows. Today was my day.''

EUROPE'S INTERNET LAG: AN AMERICAN FABRICATION?

<P>
   GENEVA -- Attend a conference or read an article about the
Internet in Europe, and there will almost certainly be a reference
to estimates that Europe is two or three years behind the United
States when it comes to doing business online.
</P>
<P>
   Recently a magazine in the United States put the figure at five
years -- placing Europe in a time when Amazon.com was still just an
idea in Jeff Bezos's head.
</P>
<P>
   But Internet executives in Europe say the size of the gap has
been exaggerated. And some blame the perception problem on American
Internet companies that have made missteps in the European market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an urban legend,'' said Laurent Edel, the founder of the
Net Economy Workshop, which pairs technology start-ups with
investors. ``Look beyond Internet penetration rates, which are kept
artificially low by telecommunication costs, and you will realize
that European companies are less far behind than the press reports.
The market is heating up at incredible speed.''
</P>
<P>
   The European Internet scene may not have the hyped-up glamour
and the overnight billionaires of Silicon Valley, but it has other
elements that characterize the industry: thousands of energetic
young entrepreneurs that are turning business rules upside-down, a
booming venture capital industry to fund them, established
companies scrambling to keep pace, skyrocketing initial public
offerings and half a dozen new stock markets. New magazines like
Amsterdam-based Tornado-Insider cover the industry and its rising
stars, and successful high-tech networking events like Edel's
workshops and First Tuesday span the continent.
</P>
<P>
   According to the investment bank Broadview International, 155
European technology companies went public on Europe's stock markets
last year, compared with 147 American companies on United States
markets. In some sectors like online banking or mobile phones,
Europe is even ahead of the United States, with countries like
Italy and Finland counting more cell phone subscribers than fixed
lines. And while consumer Internet use may have been slow to take
off, European companies are making wise use of networking
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   So why is Europe still perceived as being in Internet limbo? Ola
Ahlvarsson, the chief executive of Result Ventures Knowledge, a
Stockholm-based Internet consulting firm, suggests that the
misperception may be the result of American companies' failures at
penetrating European markets -- and their inclination to blame
their problems on the high cost of telecommunications services and
an immature market.
</P>
<P>
   With the sole exception of Yahoo, American companies have indeed
had a harder-than-expected time establishing themselves in Europe,
even in the friendly British market. Freeserve, a startup company
offering free Internet access, took just six months to overtake
America Online's local service as the leading access provider in
Britain, forcing AOL to respond by offering its own free access
plan. AOL is also a distant second in Europe's other key Internet
markets, Germany and France.
</P>
<P>
   Portal sites like Excite and Lycos, which are among the top
sites in the United States, are barely noticed in Europe. The
online auctioneer eBay recently bought a tiny German auction site,
while Amazon.com bought online booksellers in Germany and Britain
last year, but these remain marginal operations for the American
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans think that the Internet and electronic commerce are
global,'' Ahlvarsson said in a phone interview. ``Well, more
surprises are ahead for them.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason Europe has turned out to be a tough market for United
States companies to unlock is that most of them have underestimated
the importance of local conditions. The slogan ``think globally,
act locally'' may not capture the extent of the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here you will have to think locally in each of the national
markets,'' said Fabiola Arredondo, a native of Spain who leads
Yahoo's operations in seven European countries.
</P>
<P>
   There are the obvious hurdles, for which most businesses are
more or less prepared: different currencies, tax regimes and trade
regulations. But there are also profound national characteristics,
both cultural and practical, that are too often overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   On the legal side, for example, the ability of companies to
gather and sell data on consumers is drastically limited by the
European Union's regulations on privacy protection. This makes it
difficult in some cases to take systems based on profiling, cookie
technology and other more sophisticated mechanisms and transfer
them to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Even registering an Internet domain name can be a long and
painful process in some countries, because companies are often
restricted to owning only one domain name, which must be approved
by regulatory authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing a name that can be built into a brand can be tricky.
Ahlvarsson cited the example of a customer who was developing an
e-commerce site that offered gift ideas. He said the customer
``wanted to call it 'getgift.com,' which makes total sense in
English, but literally means 'go get poison for goats' in
Swedish.''
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly minor details like differences in mailbox sizes or
credit-card habits can also affect e-commerce operations. ``If you
charge a premium for guaranteed overnight delivery of books and
CDs, but the package doesn't fit in the mailbox of the customer and
goes back to the postal office waiting for him to pick it up, well,
one of your competitive advantages evaporates,'' said Ahlvarsson.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing and public relations copy is another pitfall a lot of
American companies have encountered. Europeans, unlike Americans,
are not used to aggressive marketing assaults. Merely translating
copy, while cost-effective, can result in a misfire.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, even English is different. ``What we discovered is
that the use of Americanisms in our British site, such as
'favorite' vs. 'favourite,' was not considered an Americanism by
our customers, but a spelling mistake,'' said Carl Leubsdorf, the
developer in charge of localizing parts of the Motley Fool's Web
site for Britain.
</P>
<P>
   And then, of course, there are the cultural subtleties. Ikea,
the Swedish furniture giant, is one company that has interpreted
these well. Its sites for various European countries are in tune
with the local customer base: the Italian one is stylish, the
German is more traditional, and the Saudi Arabian site features a
reassuring father-and-son shopping scene. Ikea even gave up the
standard yellow and blue colors of its logo on the Danish site,
switching to red and white so as not to impose the colors of the
Swedish flag on the sensitive Danes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Content is much harder to transpose than anything else,'' said
Yahoo's Arredondo. ``We put all our energy into local teams and
local partnerships.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this fragmentation and diversity also makes it
difficult for European companies to target customers elsewhere in
Europe, which in turn creates additional business opportunities.
That is the niche Ola Ahlvarsson has found for his new company,
Result Ventures Knowledge, which assists Internet ventures trying
to expand across the continent by offering help and advice on
recruitment, management, strategic alliances, entry strategies,
office space and legal procedures.
</P>
<P>
   In London, Larry Levy, chief executive of Protege, offers the
same services to American companies trying to replicate their
success in European markets. Levy's first piece of advice:
``Entering Europe is not about parachuting the products over here.
It's about transposing the whole operational chain into a series of
very different markets''

PROJECT TRAINS TEACHERS TO USE TECHNOLOGY
</HEADLINE>
  By PAMELA MENDELS 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)

<P>
   If all goes according to plan, by this time next year veteran
teachers and teachers-in-training across the country will be able
to log on to a new Web site and view demonstrations of tech-savvy
peers putting computers to use in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind the project, to be carried out by a group of
colleges and other institutions under the direction of the
University of Northern Iowa in Cedar Falls, is simple. Researches
hope to identify good examples of classroom technology use, tape
teachers as they employ the methods, add footage of teachers
explaining the techniques -- and then post the results on a free
Web site. With any luck, teachers who use the site will get
guidance on using technology as an educational tool and begin
emulating what they have learned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if we can provide educators with easily accessible
strategies and techniques involving technology to help students
learn more and better, they will use them,'' said William P.
Callahan, associate dean of the college of education at the
University of Northern Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   That is certainly the hope of officials at the U.S. Department
of Education, which is backing the project as part of a new federal
effort to train teachers in technology use.
</P>
<P>
   Late last month, the Department of Education announced that it
had awarded about $75 million in grants to the initiative as well
as to 223 other projects in its new Preparing Tomorrow's Teachers
to Use Technology program. Linda Roberts, director of the Office of
Educational Technology at the Department of Education,
characterized the federal effort as a ``very major new grant
program.'' She said she hopes it will go a long way toward solving
a problem facing the teaching profession: many teachers are
untrained in how to use computers for educational purposes, even
though computers have now flooded classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of training was driven home recently in a survey,
conducted by Market Data Retrieval, an educational market research
firm, that found that 61 percent of teachers polled felt at best
only ``somewhat prepared'' to integrate technology into classroom
instruction. The study also found little difference between older
teachers and those new to the profession.
</P>
<P>
   The news was not a shocker to Roberts. She said there is a
mistaken assumption that because younger teachers were raised with
computers, they are necessarily more comfortable with technology as
a teaching tool. But just because a teacher can use a computer for
word processing, she said, does not mean that person has a good
idea how to use the computer as a teaching aid.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Roberts said, a number of teacher training
programs have failed to effectively teach these pedagogical skills.
One reason, she said, is that college education departments often
lack the resources of engineering or business schools and simply
have not had the money to invest in upgrading computer equipment.
Another is that some faculty members may themselves be unfamiliar
with technology as a teaching tool, and are unable to teach those
skills to the incoming crop of teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the explanation, education officials believe that they
are confronting a demographic reality that makes the need for
technology training particularly pressing over the next few years.
Within a decade, according to the Department of Education, the
nation will be hiring 2.2 million new teachers as the retirement of
the Baby Boom generation of teachers and the push to reduce class
sizes come into play. The expected turnover in teachers, combined
with the fact that school districts in recent years have begun
spending billions of dollars on hardware and software, means that
now is the time to push technology training, Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   The grants are paying for a wide variety of projects. The
University of Southern Mississippi in Hattiesburg, for example,
will use its $175,000 grant with other partners to begin assessing
what it needs to do to upgrade its technology preparation programs.
The grant will pay for, among other things, a pilot program in how
to train the professors who teach future teachers in technology
use, according to Susan C. Malone, the project director.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the University of Virginia and a consortium of
other institutions, meanwhile, are the recipients of a $2 million
grant to develop ways to make collections of primary source
material on the Internet useful for classroom teachers. James M.
Cooper, a professor of education at the University of Virginia who
is serving as principal investigator of the project, said the
university has at least four such collections, including a detailed
database of civil war letters, newspaper articles and other
records.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is to plumb that database for lesson plans and other
useful classroom material, so that, for example, an eighth grade
history teacher might be able to construct a lesson around asking
students to explore the source documents to discover how the
opposing sides responded to Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation.
</P>
<P>
   Not all educators agree with the training program, launched by
an administration that has made a major push to put technology in
the classroom through such programs as the $2.25 billion E-rate
initiative to give schools and libraries low-cost
telecommunications services.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell W. Monke, an assistant professor of education at Grinnell
College and the co-author of a critique, to be published next year,
of classroom Internet use, says that if there are to be computers
in the classroom, teachers should be trained in their use. However,
Monke questions the whole effort to use technology for teaching,
and thinks the billions being poured into it are dollars spent on a
misguided effort that puts more faith in machinery than human
beings.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks training efforts would be better focused on
instructing teachers how to work directly with students and how to
handle the host of problems young learners face, from learning
disorders to violence. ``It's the last thing I'd spend money on,''
he said of the teacher technology training grants. ``I'd sell the
technology, so I'd have more money to train teachers how to work
with kids.''
</P>
<P>
   But Roberts responds that technology in the classroom is
inevitable, and that the training seeks to mold teachers able to
put the machinery to its best use. ``I think these grants will have
an impact on better preparing teachers overall,'' she said.

SEASON OVER FOR PALMER?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC quarterback Carson Palmer suffered a broken
collarbone in Saturday night's 33-30 loss to Oregon and probably
will be lost for the remainder of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer is officially listed as being out 6-8 weeks, which would
place his return around late November, when the Trojans only have
games with UCLA and Louisiana Tech on the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The sophomore said Sunday that he would do everything in his
power to return in time for the UCLA game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to sit out. I want to play,'' Palmer said. ``I
want to play in the UCLA game. It's going to be tough to come back
this year, but I'm going to try.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer believed he might heal even faster, citing a broken
collarbone he suffered in his sophomore year at Santa Margarita
High that sidelined him for just four games. But that injury was
only a crack in the collarbone, while this latest incident was a
clean break and considered more serious.
</P>
<P>
   An intriguing sidelight is that Palmer could redshirt under NCAA
rules, because he did not play in more than three games this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to sit out,'' Palmer said. ``I want to play.
(But) if the coaches think it's best to redshirt, then I'll
redshirt.''
</P>
<P>
   As for speculation the issue is moot anyway, because he might
turn pro early, Palmer said, ``I plan on being here for four years.
Maybe five now.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Palmer would return for the UCLA game, USC coach Paul
Hackett said, ``I wouldn't rule that out, but I would say that's
unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said it was too early to decide if Palmer would
redshirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a distinct possibility,'' he said. ``I don't feel I can
make that decision when I (don't know how fast he will heal).''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer regretted that he tried to gain a few extra yards before
being hit by Oregon rover Michael Fletcher just two plays before
halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was stupid, I don't know why I did it,'' Palmer said. ``It
would have been more macho to go out of bounds.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a rough weekend for the Palmer family. Carson's little
brother, Jordan, received a concussion Thursday playing quarterback
for the Santa Margarita junior varsity team.
</P>
<P>
   With Palmer out, junior Mike Van Raaphorst takes over as USC's
starter, with senior John Fox the backup. Fox started nine games in
1997. He will now move to quarterback full-time after playing
linebacker this year.
</P>
<P>
   If USC needs a No. 3 quarterback, it would be sophomore walk-on
Matt Dalton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm nervous,'' Hackett said.

QUAYLE, OUTSPENT BY BUSH, WILL QUIT RACE, AIDE SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for inserts, rewriting throughout) (sw) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former Vice President Dan Quayle has decided to
drop out of the race for president, a senior official with his
campaign said on Sunday night, because he is convinced that he
would not be able to raise enough money to keep pace with Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The official said that Quayle had struggled to remain optimistic
about his chances of winning the Republican Party nomination but
that a review of his campaign's finances in recent days had forced
him to conclude that the odds against him were insurmountable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although Vice President Quayle was extremely bullish on the
campaign's progress nationally and in New Hampshire, it became
clear that he did not have the resources to compete effectively in
the 18 or so contests that occur in the 30 days following New
Hampshire,'' said the official, who would speak only on the
condition of not being named.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire holds the nation's first presidential primary
contest early next year, and Quayle had invested significant time,
money and hope there.
</P>
<P>
   But, the official said, Quayle came to realize that ``even a
strong showing or win there would not provide the momentum needed
to achieve ultimate victory. And he's always said that the moment
he concluded that the campaign could no longer secure victory, he
would not ask supporters to continue expending their time and
energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle is the fourth candidate to drop out of the race for the
Republican nomination. Preceding him were Rep. John Kasich of Ohio,
former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Sen. Bob Smith of New
Hampshire, who announced that he was leaving the Republican Party
and would press forward with the quest for the presidency on his
own.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle's exit narrows the field of Republican contenders to
eight, including the conservative television commentator Pat
Buchanan. But there is widespread belief that Buchanan might decide
to seek the nomination of the Reform Party instead.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment Quayle announced his candidacy in Huntington,
Ind., on April 14, it failed to catch fire. Like most other
candidates, he was eclipsed by Bush, who has become, far and away,
the front-runner for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, it was the Texas governor's father, President George
Bush, who first put Quayle on t(e national stage by picking him for
the vice presidency, which Quayle held from 1989 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But during those years, Quayle arguably became most famous for
his awkward, embarrassing verbal gaffes, and his campaign seemed in
part to be an uphill struggle to persuade voters to take him
seriously. Quayle appealed to voters by advocating a 30 percent
across-the-board tax cut and a return to traditional values.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign's fate seemed to be sealed, however, when Quayle
finished eighth among the nine candidates who competed in Iowa's
nonbinding straw poll last month. Afterward, leading people working
for Quayle in several states defected to rivals' campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle pressed on, insisting he was not discouraged. In an
interview a week and a half after the straw poll, while he was
campaigning in New Hampshire, Quayle said, ``Believe me, if I
didn't think I had a good chance of winning _ why spend 18 hours a
day, six, seven days a week doing this?''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are other things in life,`' Quayle added. ``The moment
I'm convinced that I can't win, then I won't be here.`'
</P>
<P>
   The campaign official said the moment came over the weekend and
was a matter of dollars and sense. The official would not give
details of Quayle's fund-raising since June 30, when he reported a
total of $3.5 million in campaign contributions for the first two
quarters of the year. Bush, by contrast, reported about $37 million
for that period, and has since gone over $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Another adviser to the Quayle campaign, also speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Quayle could no longer ignore that
disparity. ``At some point,'' the adviser said on Sunday night,
``your head takes over your heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has also consistently led his Republican rivals in national
opinion polls by large double-digit margins. Although one recent
national poll showed Quayle a very distant second, most others have
put Elizabeth Dole, the former president of the Red Cross, in that
position, and some have shown Quayle also trailing Sen. John McCain
of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle had gained little enough traction that it is unclear
whether his departure from the race will have much of an impact on
any of the other contenders in the field. Quayle was concentrating
especially on the conservative end of the Republican spectrum, a
group of voters also being wooed by the wealthy publisher Steve
Forbes, the radio talk show host Alan Keyes and Gary Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle's advisers would not say whether Quayle planned to
endorse one of his rivals.

YOU don't concede a 10-foot birdie putt when it's all square on the
last hole of the Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   You don't take a knee in the fourth quarter of the Super Bowl
when it's first-and-goal with the score tied.
</P>
<P>
   Team Kool Green owner Barry Green did the right thing Sunday
afternoon. He didn't give the Texaco/Havoline Grand Prix of Houston
to the wrong guy.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't instruct Paul Tracy to ease his foot off the throttle
and concede the race to CART points-title contender and Kool Green
teammate Dario Franchitti, who was square in the middle of Tracy's
rearview mirror as this entertaining race wound to a close.
</P>
<P>
   It might not have been the best thing to do, and in the end it
might not prove to be the smartest thing. But it was the right
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy was too dominant to finish second. He was the one who had
it all on this day, everything working perfectly, every instinct
the right one, every move perfectly timed and his car running
without peer.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy earned this win, and he got it. Good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't like it, but I like it,'' Green said of his decision
to leave Tracy alone at the front of the pack as he whisked to a
nearly 14-second win over Franchitti.
</P>
<P>
   Green's quandary was a captivating one throughout the day,
especially as Franchitti inched into second place after several
early troubles. Had Green instructed Tracy to allow Franchitti to
pass, Franchitti would have earned four more points than the 16 he
gained on CART season series leader Juan Montoya, whose
aggressiveness and miscommunication with Target owner Chip Ganassi
left Montoya scoreless on this day.
</P>
<P>
   Those four points certainly could prove to be the difference in
the season points race, considering Montoya still has a 13-point
lead on Franchitti with just two races remaining. The four points
might in fact cost Team Kool Green dearly in the end, considering
its intense rivalry with the Target team and all the money and
prestige that go with the season title.
</P>
<P>
   But Tracy was the best. He earned the trophy _ a golden boot _
one year after a bump and crash with Franchitti forced Tracy out of
the field and left him feeling embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to be holding this boot in my hand,'' Tracy said,
``instead of having it up my butt.''
</P>
<P>
   It was nice that Green didn't rip the trophy out of Tracy's
hands for the sake of Franchitti, a move many other team owners
would have made without hesitation. Green knew this was Tracy's
dominant day, and neither Franchitti nor Tracy would have wanted
the race to end any other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, I wouldn't (have wanted to give up the lead),'' Tracy
said, making mock static noises as if talking on the radio with
Green. ``I would have said, `I can't hear you. What? What are you
saying?' But I was never asked to let him pass, so I'm not going to
pull over on the side of the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Franchitti: ``I was trying to catch him (Tracy), but he was
gone. If I was right up on Paul's gearbox, then maybe we would have
talked about it. But he was dominant. He just deserved it.''
</P>
<P>
   Montoya's hard-charging style cost him dearly when he ran into
the broken-down Helio Castro-Neves on the 13th lap, and it soon
became clear just how dominant Tracy would be. With the
Target/Ganassi team out of sync and Montoya out of the race, no one
else could come close to Tracy.
</P>
<P>
   When informed that Ganassi said he didn't hear race officials
declare that Castro-Neves had run into the wall on Turn 10,
bottling up the tight curve, Tracy rolled his eyebrows and said,
``Maybe Chip was looking at his reflection in the monitor.''
</P>
<P>
   This indeed is an intense fight between the Target and Kool
Green teams, a season-long battle that both would dearly love to
win. But no matter how much those four extra points might mean in
the long run, Green wasn't about to take this race away from Tracy.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy broke from the second row into second place at the drop of
the green flag. When Montoya's car was disabled, Tracy took the
lead and extended it to three seconds in a matter of one lap. He
then extended the lead to eight seconds, then 14 seconds, then 20
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy ran smoothly the entire day, conserving fuel and running
hard, staying out of trouble and driving smartly while most other
drivers were forced into two pit stops and never had a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he (Green) realized it was my day,'' Tracy said. ``He
was happy to leave it at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who saw the race should realize Green's non-call was the
right call. Franchitti pulled within 13 points of Montoya, and with
two races left he can still pursue the season title. But on this
day, the best driver and the best car won.
</P>
<P>
   You wouldn't have wanted it to end any other way.

VICE PRESIDENT SELLS HIS UNDERDOG ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN, N.H. _ Vice President Al Gore has a new role in the
first primary state: underdog.
</P>
<P>
   With four recent polls showing him in a statistical dead heat
with Bill Bradley in the Democratic primary, Gore is beginning to
acknowledge publicly that he has a dogfight on his hands, and has
compared himself to former president Harry Truman, who was expected
to lose to Thomas Dewey so many years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many people remember the presidential race of 1948?'' Gore
asked at the Coos County Democratic dinner this weekend. A
smattering of hands were raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``You remember how far behind Harry Truman was? Thirty, 40
points. How the news media wrote him off? How he was expected to
lose even though his position on the issues were ones people
generally agreed with?
</P>
<P>
   ``So he gave them hell,'' Gore continued in an interview Sunday.
``He gave his opponents hell and went straight to the people and
fought with every breath in his body and had the great satisfaction
of holding up that newspaper headline that said, `Dewey defeats
Truman.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Truman defeated Dewey, upsetting all the
prognosticators. And clearly, Gore believes, his situation in the
polls does not have to be permanent, based on Truman's own
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we've got to fight for it,'' Gore said at the Mount
Washington Hotel on Saturday night. ``We've got to be willing to do
our damnedest and give it everything we've got.''
</P>
<P>
   The visit over the weekend to the North Country, Keene and
Manchester also represents the beginning of a shift in strategy for
the Gore campaign. Tension between the state office and the
Washington headquarters has finally been resolved in favor of the
state advisers. They want Gore to appear in more intimate settings,
rather than in large, scripted productions. They hope to have him
jump out of his Suburban more often, for surprise visits with
voters, and they want to cut back on his appearances at the
establishment Democratic Party events.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday morning, Gore visited a dozen residents of Berlin, the
last working mill town in the state. At Lawrence and Elizabeth
Kelly's wood-shingle home on Emery Street, the vice president and
his wife, Tipper, sat on a blue-flowered sofa in the living room,
with everyone else on chairs around them.
</P>
<P>
   The topic of the day was economic development, an area of
intense interest in a part of the state that has experienced the
deepest depths of recession. Lawrence Kelly wanted to know if Gore
sees a link between education and economic development.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, he did. ``This is the key as more and more of
our work is done with our minds,'' Gore said, explaining the
importance of connecting schools to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Several guests complained that high-speed Internet access is
unavailable in their remote town of 12,000. That, in turn, prevents
economic growth from happening, they said. What they were looking
for, however, was tangible help from the vice president, rather
than a distant promise from a potential president.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he would send a state-federal team of people to meet
with representatives of the phone, cable, and satellite companies.
``Let's figure out a solution to this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also reassured Ed Mears, a millwright at the Pulp and Paper
of America, that Gore would try to help the company meet its
``cluster rule'' requirements for reducing pollution in the air and
water.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need help to stay alive,'' said Mears, who is also a state
representative from Berlin. ``If there would be assistance in that
regard, you'd gain tremendous momentum in the North Country.''
</P>
<P>
   On jobs and the environment, Gore repeatedly told people that he
is for ``mixed use'' of the land, preserving the natural beauty
while allowing logging and other work to continue simultaneously.
He said he was for ``practical'' and ``balanced'' approaches to the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Mears later said that Gore's book, ``Earth in the Balance,'' and
his reputation as an environmental leader, have been problematic in
an area where many people make their living from logging and
related businesses. ``In this neck of the woods,'' Gore's
reputation ``is not considered to be worker friendly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But after listening to the vice president, Mears said he was
convinced that Gore is not out to kill industry. ``He has every
intention of keeping the economy strong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides trying to convince voters one-on-one and in small groups
that he has the goods to be the Democratic nominee, the Gore
campaign began a canvassing drive this weekend passing out a
brochure about Gore's plans to improve education, fix the health
care system, toughen gun-control laws and strengthen Social
Security. About 200 volunteers knocked on doors in Claremont, Keene
and Manchester, and there are plans to reach 50,000 homes by
mid-October.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign, by contrast, began canvassing the state in
August, and has continued every weekend since, raising the former
senator's profile as the race shifts into a higher gear for autumn.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the literature drops and the smaller campaign venues,
Gore told his audience Saturday night that he's been underestimated
before, and he doesn't mind being underestimated again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran for Congress in 1976,'' he said, as his wife sat
listening. ``I was expected to finish seventh in a nine-person
race. And Tipper and I beat them with shoe leather. We got out and
shook hands with everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we know how to do that,'' he said.

EX-UCLA STAR MCNOWN PASSES TIME IN NFL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ The visiting-locker-room doors swung open Sunday at
Network Associates Coliseum and a crowd quickly assembled around
the quarterback's cubicle.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Cade McNown hadn't gotten the Bears as far as midfield in
his only series in a 24-17 loss to the Raiders. But he was a
Northern California (and Oregon) kid who was schooled in Southern
California making his first appearance as a professional in the
Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   Familiarity breeds fanfare and so it was starting quarterback
Shane Matthews was able to slip into the showers unbothered while
reporters stared silently at McNown's back as the former UCLA
standout stood in dress pants and power loafers, buttoning a dress
shirt.
</P>
<P>
   At length, somebody spoke up. Had McNown caught any of the
previous day's telecast of the Bruins' Pacific-10 opening loss at
Stanford, their first conference defeat since the first game of
McNown's junior year?
</P>
<P>
   Without missing a beat or a button, McNown said stiffly, ``I'll
talk with you when I'm finished dressing.''
</P>
<P>
   But of course. When you're helpless to govern your playing time,
you have to control what you can.
</P>
<P>
   When McNown finally turned around, he was all smiles. From an
individual standpoint, he had every reason to be. Playing, as
scripted, in the Bears' first series of the second quarter, McNown
completed 3 of 5 passes for 38 yards. He looked confident and
comfortable and if it gnawed at his insides to get no more shots at
the end zone, his sideline demeanor didn't show it.
</P>
<P>
   He patted more backs than a politician at a fund-raiser, and
afterward, was every bit as diplomatic. Sure, he said, he was
pleased with his own performance. ``I'll tell you what though,'' he
added, ``the loss just sours anything I did personally.''
</P>
<P>
   The player who was being touted for the Heisman Trophy a year
ago at this time went on to laud Bears running back Curtis Enis and
kick returner Glyn Milburn.
</P>
<P>
   Until his coaches decide otherwise, that's McNown's job. He is
the NFL's highest-paid cheerleader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on the sideline just trying to rev my teammates up,''
McNown said.
</P>
<P>
   It says here it's a good thing, for McNown to sit with his
engine idling for a spell. McNown's life since he entered UCLA has
gone by like scenery outside the window of a speeding car. It has
been a blur, from his first starts as a freshman to his last starts
for a national championship-contending team to his selection at No.
12 overall by Chicago in April's draft to his contract holdout to
the recent revelation that he, like 18 other UCLA football players,
had acquired a disabled-parking placard.
</P>
<P>
   When your life is going by so fast, perspective often is the
first thing to be lost. McNown has yet to apologize for having a
disabled-parking placard _ the closest he'll come is to say the way
he went about acquiring it was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   He also has some amends to make with his new teammates and
football fans in Chicago after missing the first 11 days of
training camp while his agent squeezed every last dime out of the
Bears.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, a little time out of the fast lane might do McNown a world
of good. It already appears to have benefited him. McNown is
getting smarter with every rep he takes. And he was wise enough
Sunday to scramble from any suggestion of a quarterback
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's up to the coaches,'' said McNown, demurely leaving it
to others to point out how Matthews appears more nearsighted in his
choice of receivers than McNown, who really digs the long ball.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas Matthews dinked the Raiders' defense nearly to death,
McNown completed the prettiest pass of the game, a 30-yard spiral
on a third-and-18 play from the Bears' 4-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   McNown released the pass with both feet in his own end zone and
it landed softly in the outstretched arms of Macy Brooks, who was
streaking down the right sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It couldn't have been thrown any better,'' said Brooks, who
had Charles Woodson covering him like a tarp.
</P>
<P>
   Three plays later, Raiders defensive end Lance Johnstone burst
into the Bears' backfield, untouched, and had McNown in his grasp
before the quarterback somehow spun free. His escape made an
impression on Raiders defensive tackle Darrell Russell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very surprised he didn't play more,'' Russell, formerly of
USC, said after posing for a postgame photograph with McNown. ``I'm
more scared of Cade than I am of Shane just because Cade's more
mobile.''
</P>
<P>
   When Russell's words were relayed to him later, McNown smiled
and said, ``That's very nice he says things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   But he stopped well short of agreeing. ``I just need to continue
to progress,'' he said. ``I just try to keep my mouth shut. I'm not
trying to push anything. I've just got to be patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but can he?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can be patient for a little while,'' he said, then laughed.
``I guess that's not really patience, though.''

   WHEELING, Mo. _ It's unclear whether Maj. Charles Morley and
Capt. John Seuell knew each other. But in many ways, they lived the
same life.
</P>
<P>
   Both grew up in small Missouri towns, graduated from Central
Missouri State University, joined the Air Force and trained in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Both were navigators in the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Both fell from the sky and were lost in alien jungles.
</P>
<P>
   For decades _ through Watergate, disco, Reagan, the fall of the
Berlin Wall and the Gulf War _ their families mourned. In different
ways.
</P>
<P>
   In a Warrensburg apartment, Josephine Morley still sheds tears
as she sits in a rocking chair and her son's memory invades her
mind.
</P>
<P>
   In a farm home, Austin and Maxine Seuell plan new ways to create
a positive legacy for their fallen son.
</P>
<P>
   The families never allowed themselves to forget. And they never
built too much hope that their sons' remains would be found.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Defense Department searched for Morley, Seuell
and others missing in action.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers with the Joint Task Force _ Full Accounting have
interviewed residents in Asia, studied incident reports and dug
through crash sites. They toil in the hope of giving families a
peaceful final chapter.
</P>
<P>
   The task force has identified 529 sets of remains, but more than
2,000 men and women are unaccounted for. Forensic scientists are
working to identify about 100 sets of remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``This country happens to place a high value on the serviceman
or woman. The government feels an obligation to ensure that this
commitment is upheld,'' said Larry Greer of the Defense
Department's POW//Missing Personnel Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as it takes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Josephine Morley owns more pictures than her shelves and tables
can hold. More than 30 framed photos stand on the floor, sprouting
like flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Her eyes move past those pictures to one on a corner table.
</P>
<P>
   She looks into the eyes of her son, Charles.
</P>
<P>
   Her hair has grayed, but Charles is a son frozen in time. ``I
look at that picture and think, `What a handsome young man,' '' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   He was a sports star in high school and played football at
Central Missouri State, where he married his high school
sweetheart.
</P>
<P>
   He enlisted in the Air Force and soon was sent overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Morley says she created a world where Vietnam didn't exist.
</P>
<P>
   She avoided television reports and newspaper articles about the
subject. When Charles wrote, he never mentioned the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wrote me like he was off at school and nothing else,''
Morley said. ``I think he wanted to keep that part of his life from
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came the news that her son's aircraft had been shot down,
two days before he was scheduled to return home.
</P>
<P>
   According to Pentagon files, Morley and his pilot left a South
Vietnamese base on Feb. 18, 1970, for a night bombing mission over
Laos.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-aircraft fire hit their plane. Witnesses reported seeing a
large fireball on the ground about a mile east of the target.
</P>
<P>
   Josephine Morley has erased nearly all memories of the day she
was told of her son's disappearance. She doesn't remember how many
Air Force men came to her family's home, what they said or who was
with her.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't even recall whether it was day or night.
</P>
<P>
   As Morley discussed her son, she held his picture. Occasionally,
she stroked the surface like a mother caressing a baby.
</P>
<P>
   She tries, as much as she can, to keep Charles out of her mind.
Another son and Charles' widow dealt with the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just try not to think about him,'' she said, shaking her
head. ``I try not to think. That's what I've always done.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Morley avoided movies and documentaries about
Vietnam. She assumed that the government had stopped searching for
her son. Meanwhile, the local high school built a memorial and
dedicated a scholarship to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he left, I told him to trust in the Lord and we'd have to
do what He said,'' Morley said. ``It didn't make much of a
difference if they found him. It really didn't matter. I knew where
he was. He was in heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin and Maxine Seuell's memories of Vietnam are painful, too.
</P>
<P>
   But they confront them, embrace them and try to preserve them.
</P>
<P>
   John, their oldest son, was a quiet, polite boy. His parents
trace his love of airplanes to a childhood trip to a local airport.
</P>
<P>
   Seuell went to Central Methodist College before transferring to
Central Missouri State. He graduated with a degree in business and
got married.
</P>
<P>
   Seuell and his younger brother, Gordon, both went to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any mother would be concerned for their children,'' Maxine
Seuell said. ``But we just took for granted that they would make it
home.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Gordon who called his parents from Vietnam to tell them
that his brother had been shot down. By the time the men from the
Air Force traversed gravel roads to the Seuell home, most of the
town knew.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon report says that Seuell and his pilot were flying
in a four-aircraft formation over North Vietnam on June 6, 1972.
When one plane became low on fuel the pilots started to leave the
area.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Seuell's plane encountered MiG fighters and
surface-to-air missiles. A missile detonated and the plane went
down in flames.
</P>
<P>
   Enemy forces made a detailed search impossible.
</P>
<P>
   There is no memorial to Seuell. But his parents have created
living tributes.
</P>
<P>
   Through a church group, they have sponsored children in Seuell's
name all over the world. Their first child lived in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   They've affirmed their religious faith, too. Several times a
month, they minister to female inmates.

   WHEELING, Mo. _ And they have kept Vietnam in mind, too.
</P>
<P>
   They found their son's name on the traveling replica of the
Vietnam Veterans Memorial that stopped in Unionville. They also
heard a former prisoner of war speak at an area high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know his body is gone, but his spirit is in heaven,'' Maxine
Seuell said. ``That's the part of him I want to keep alive, the
memory.''
</P>
<P>
   After months of analysis, the Defense Department in August
officially identified a set of human remains as Charles Frank
Morley.
</P>
<P>
   His Pentagon files show the clues that led to the answer:
interviews with a village chief in Laos, maps of crash sites, the
recovery of survival kits, several excavations in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Josephine Morley always said it didn't matter whether they found
her son. But when she heard the news, she was surprised at how she
felt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier now,'' she said. ``I don't know why, but it is. It
helps to know what happened to him and why. It's closure.''
</P>
<P>
   In a few weeks, Morley and other relatives will attend a
ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   The Seuells were encouraged to hear that Morley was found.
Maybe, just maybe, researchers might find a path to their son too.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Necci, chairman of the National POW//MIA Committee for the
Vietnam Veterans of America, says the Joint Task Force's efforts
have given hope to thousands of families.
</P>
<P>
   Necci credits the task force's persistence and the cooperation
of Vietnam, Laos and other nations.
</P>
<P>
   But the work won't be easy. Necci says U.S. and foreign
governments lack the staffing and money to expand their efforts.
Meanwhile, terrain changes, vegetation grows and witnesses die.
</P>
<P>
   So thousands of families continue to wait.
</P>
<P>
   The Morleys and Seuells shared a tragedy. They dealt with it in
different ways. As Necci talks with families around the nation, he
hears hundreds of different tales. But, he says, the families share
one sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the families I work with are activists. They're very
well-informed. Other families have purposely closed those years and
moved on,'' Necci said. ``They've accepted in their own minds that
their son was lost and that he'll never be found.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outwardly, it might seem that they've put it aside,'' he said.
``In truth, they probably haven't. It's never really over with.''

BULLRING LESSON GIVEN AT FAIRPLEX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   POMONA, Calif. _ Garrett Gomez is not one of the big-track
jockeys who stay away from little Fairplex Park for fear of the
sharp turns. He wasn't spooked by the fatal accident on opening
day.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez stayed away this season so he and wife Pam _ they were
married in June _ could honeymoon in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like bullrings,'' said Gomez, who used to make the hard
lefts at Maryland's Timonium racetrack, Nebraska's Fonner Park and
Chicago's Sportsmens Park. ``Bullrings teach young riders a lot.
You learn when to get in and when to get out. And if you don't (get
out of tight quarters), you get up brushing yourself off,
hopefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, on closing day of the L.A. County Fair season, Gomez
teamed with a Fairplex-loving gelding to stage a clinic on bullring
racing, he and 6-year-old Native Desert hugging the rail for 1[
miles to win the $100,000 Ralph M. Hinds Pomona Invitational
Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   Bold Words and leading Fairplex rider Martin Pedroza finished 1\
lengths back in second. Mel Stute-trained Kona Wind came in fifth
in the six-horse field, leaving Stute and Paul Aguirre tied for the
training title with nine victories apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Native Desert, a California-bred 6-year-old claimed by trainer
Juan Garcia for $32,000 in 1996, ran his Fairplex record to 3 for
4, including a pair of sprint stakes victories in 1997. Lately he'd
been testing his cornering ability on the local turf courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sure helps when you've got a horse like Native Desert who
does everything right,'' Gomez said.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez recorded his lone victory in only three rides at the
18-day fair. His scheduled races on Sept. 9 were canceled after
jockey J.C. Gonzalez was killed in an accident caused by a horse's
breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have happened anywhere,'' Gomez said.
</P>
<P>
   Pedroza, who rode 29 winners (to Iggy Puglisi's 23) to win his
second Fairplex title, received the first J.C. Gonzalez Memorial
Jockey Trophy in a winner's circle ceremony attended by some of
Gonzalez's family.
</P>
<P>
   Fairplex vice president for racing Neil O'Dwyer reported a
decline of about 4 percent from last year's track-record $108
million wagered at the meet. The seven canceled races accounted for
the approximately $3 million difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``After (the) tragic start, I truly believe 48 hours later
everybody had rallied and focused on the future,'' O'Dwyer said at
the top of the grandstand. ``The jockey colony pulled together on
and off the track, looked out for each other, and it made for very
safe racing.''
</P>
<P>
   The two-horse accident that killed Gonzalez had been the only
fall of the meet until Octavio Vergara went down _ not hurt
seriously _ in Sunday's 10th race.
</P>
<P>
   __ Notes: The Oak Tree association opens its 31st season at
Santa Anita Wednesday at 1 p.m. Pat Valenzuela, returning from
suspension after nearly two years, has four mounts on the nine-race
card. . . . Contributions are being accepted for a trust fund for

PATRIOTS TOP GIANTS, 16-14 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. _ The New York Giants looked terrific on the
first possession of their game on Sunday night against the New
England Patriots. Unfortunately for the Giants, they had to play
the rest of the game. And they had no more tricks up their sleeve
until it was far too late.
</P>
<P>
   Another hapless offensive performance doomed the Giants at
Foxboro Stadium as they scored on their first drive of the game but
not score again until the game was all but over. Meanwhile, playing
too often, the Giants' defense eventually wore down.
</P>
<P>
   A relentless Patriots offense, led by quarterback Drew Bledsoe,
took advantage of a fatigued Giants defense to move into position
for three second-half field goals as New England remained
undefeated after three games with a 16-14 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants (1-2) lost for the second consecutive week after
winning their season opener at Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots, who joined Tennessee as the only 3-0 teams, kept
pounding at the Giants. In the second half, New England was winning
the battle at the line of scrimmage and moved into position
methodically for each of its field goals, breaking open a game that
was tied at halftime, 7-7.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' offense, which once again struggled mightily to move
the ball on the ground, did little against the Patriots' defense,
which pressured Giants quarterback Kent Graham throughout the game
and forced him into several hurried throws.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Giants scored a touchdown when they first had the
ball, they did not not score again until 1 minute 14 seconds
remained, when Tiki Barber caught a 1-yard touchdown pass from
Graham to cut the Patriots' lead to 2 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the first drive I would have thought we would put a lot
more points on the board,'' said Graham, who completed 23 of 36
passes for 216 yards. ``But different things can break down. It's a
long season, and hopefully people will be patient with us. You have
to keep it in perspective. It's a 16-game season and we're 1-2.''
</P>
<P>
   Giants Coach Jim Fassel was miffed at his offense's inability to
move the football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't honestly tell you exactly what was going wrong,'' he
said. ``There were different malfunctions at different times. I
think we came ready to play, and our approach to this game was much
better than last week. But we've got to get better or we're not
going to win games.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe finished the game with 20 completions in 28 pass
attempts for 233 yards with no interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the fourth quarter, an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty
on the Patriots' Tedy Bruschi gave the Giants the opportunity to
regain the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Graham had been sacked on a third-and-10 play but fumbled after
it was whistled over. In the ensuing scramble for the ball, which
was moot, Bruschi and Giants left guard Luke Petitgout tussled for
the ball. Bruschi then threw the ball at Petitgout, drawing a
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   With an automatic first down, the Giants moved into New England
territory, but Brad Daluiso missed a 41-yard field goal attempt
with slightly more than eight minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
   A sequence midway through the third quarter illustrated how the
game's momentum had swung toward the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   On a fourth-and-1 at the Patriots' 40-yard line, the Giants
attempted a quarterback sneak over the right guard. It was the
second time tonight that the Giants had tried this play, and this
time New England was waiting for Graham.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I got the first down,'' Graham said. ``With second
effort I was over the pile, over the line. It was a bad spot of the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Giants turned the ball over on downs, the Patriots
marched downfield on a Giants defense that was starting to look
fatigued.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants were lucky to halt the drive at the 2-yard line. Adam
Vinatieri's 19-yard field goal gave the Patriots a 13-7 lead late
in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Vinatieri added a 41-yard field goal with just over three
minutes remaining that provided what proved to be the winning
points.
</P>
<P>
   It was obvious from the beginning on Sunday night that Fassel
had designed a new offensive scheme for the game. He threw on first
down repeatedly, opened the game with two tight ends so that the
pass-catching tight end Pete Mitchell could get on the field and
started the game with a one-back formation that featured fullback
Charles Way.
</P>
<P>
   All of those things worked on the first possession but became
less effective as the game wore on.
</P>
<P>
   But the first drive, which was scripted, was the best the team's
offense has looked this season. The Giants came out throwing,
Graham trying to hit his favorite target, Amani Toomer, on the
first play. The pass was not complete, but Toomer drew a defensive
holding call, good for a first down.
</P>
<P>
   After Way rumbled for 4 yards, Fassel had Graham on the run in
the pocket, and Graham, while sprinting to his right, fired a pass
to Ike Hilliard for 27 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, who has been quiet for most of the season, found a
seam in the middle of the Patriots' defense for 7 yards to extend
the drive.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' starting running back, Sean Bennett, ran for 1 yard
on the next play but was knocked out with a sprained right knee. A
play later, Graham, again on the move in the pocket, connected with
Hilliard again for 8 yards.
</P>
<P>
   A successful quarterback sneak on a third-and-1 moved the Giants
inside the Patriots' 10-yard line. After a 3-yard run by Way, the
Giants lined up for a second-and-6. LeShon Johnson, playing for
Bennett, lined up split wide on the left side.
</P>
<P>
   New England didn't send a defender out to cover Johnson. Seeing
this, Graham had the ball snapped quickly and threw to Johnson, who
caught the ball standing alone in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants struggled to duplicate the efficiency of that first
drive throughout the next two quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Graham was reasonably sharp, completing 12 of 16 first-half
passes, and he continued to develop rapport with Toomer and
Hilliard. But the Giants' running game once again was hopelessly
inept, averaging 2.2 yards on 26 rushing attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Way banged away, but there were few holes, and when
there were, it seemed the Giants backs were out of rhythm _ either
hitting the hole too soon or too late.

HAWKS' QUICK START STUNS STEELERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Mike Holmgren was beginning to feel more than just
a little like the father to 53 belligerent kids.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks coach had harped on and harangued his new players
about getting off to fast starts, only to watch them stagger and
sputter in the first halves of their season-opening loss to the
Detroit Lions and their limp-from-behind victory last week over the
Chicago Bears.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, after a week of heightened emphasis that at times
bordered on pleading, the message finally sunk in during the
Seahawks' stunningly easy 29-10 victory over the previously
unbeaten Pittsburgh Steelers in Three Rivers Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   On the third play of the game, recently signed safety Merton
Hanks intercepted a Kordell Stewart pass that had caromed off
Steelers wide receiver Will Blackwell and returned it 23 yards for
a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Four plays later, rookie Charlie Rogers retreated to catch Josh
Miller's 62-yard punt at the Seattle 6, only to return it a
club-record 94 yards for another touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Before their offense had even taken the field, the Seahawks were
up 14-0.
</P>
<P>
   Then, an instant before the first offensive snap, Jon Kitna
changed the play at the line of scrimmage before firing a 51-yard
pass to Mike Pritchard.
</P>
<P>
   Before Holmgren could utter ``start fast,'' his team already
had. Finally and, as it turned out, unforgivingly.
</P>
<P>
   By the time this rout was over, the Seahawks had intercepted
five passes, Todd Peterson had kicked five field goals and the
Steelers had been rocked on their heels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started the game quickly, which we emphasized all week,''
Holmgren said after the Seahawks had pushed their record to 2-1 by
pushing the Steelers all over the field in their home opener that
was over by halftime, when half of the 57,881 fans had already gone
in pursuit of more satisfying activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great win.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just the Seahawks' second victory after their
disheartening loss to the Lions, but their second on the road. The
Seahawks had not won successive road games since Weeks 4 and 6 of
the 1996 season, when they won in Tampa Bay and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going on the road and being able to come out with a win, it's
huge in this business,'' Holmgren said.
</P>
<P>
   Steelers coach Bill Cowher still was reeling after the game over
how quickly the game had gotten away from his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We threw the interception for a touchdown, then you turn
around and you can't make a third-and-inches,'' he said. ``You punt
the ball, and they return it for a touchdown. We never recovered
from that.''
</P>
<P>
   Those were the two plays that stuck out Sunday, because they
came so quickly and proved to be so decisive in a game where the
offense failed to find the end zone despite finding a way to roll
up 341 yards against a Steelers defense that entered the game
ranked second in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks didn't need anything more than Peterson's five
field goals because they got so much more from their maligned
special teams and especially their defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought our defense played the most complete game I've ever
seen a defense play. Ever. Ever,'' said guard Brian Habib, who is
in his second season with the Seahawks after playing five each with
the Broncos and Vikings. ``Our defense basically won this game
today.''
</P>
<P>
   No play was bigger than Hanks' interception and TD return.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helped jump start us,'' Hanks said. ``That's what we were
trying to do. So that was big for us.''
</P>
<P>
   No play was longer than Rogers' punt return for a TD.
</P>
<P>
   The 94-yarder bettered the old record of 89 yards by Joey
Galloway in 1995, the rookie season for the club's leading receiver
whose holdout has now reached 59 days. Rogers' redemption return
also came two weeks after he muffed a punt return inside the 5-yard
line to setup a Lions touchdown in the opening-day loss to Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Holmgren didn't cut me, he didn't even yell at me after
the play against the Lions,'' said Rogers, a fifth-round draft
choice from Georgia Tech. ``He just said, `Charlie, you're going to
be our punt returner all year and you've got to go out and make
plays.' This was just a way to tell the team I'm here to stay and
I'm going to make some plays.''
</P>
<P>
   But what made these big plays stand up were the little things
done by the defense and even the offense.
</P>
<P>
   Things like the defense harassing Stewart into such a horrendous
first-half showing that Cowher went to backup Mike Tomczak in the
second half after Stewart had completed almost half as many passes
to Seahawks (3) as he did to Steelers (7).
</P>
<P>
   ``He seemed like he did get frustrated, I kind of sensed it,''
defensive end Phillip Daniels said of Stewart. ``One time, I know
for sure that he threw the ball and he knew he threw an
interception. Before he even released it, he knew it was an
interception. He was frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is, we jumped on them, and it's hard to recover
from that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks' offense also did things that frustrated the
Steelers, and even without trying.
</P>
<P>
   Things like burning up most of the 40-second clock in the huddle
before coming to the line and then getting the snap off with only
four or five seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``It did confuse them,'' Pritchard said. ``I noted that to our
coaches coming off the field. They were confused lining up. They
were confused matching up. They had to check to a lot of zone
coverages. I think that's the creativity that Holmgren brings.''
</P>
<P>
   The delay in breaking the huddle was not by design. But as
offensive coordinator Mike Sherman offered with a smile, ``We'll
take credit for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the ball was snapped, Kitna did a good job of getting it
off quickly to the right receiver at the right time. He completed
18 of 29 passes for 265 yards _ with Pritchard catching six passes
for 90 yards and Sean Dawkins grabbing five for 105 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Kitna, like everyone else in the Seahawks' locker room, couldn't
help but shift the credit to where it rightfully belonged _ the
quick start.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we talked about all week to come out and start
fast,'' he said. ``It didn't matter if it was the offense, defense
or special teams. Whatever it took, we wanted to start fast.''
</P>
<P>
   That it was, in order, the defense, special teams and offense,
``That was huge for us,'' Kitna said.

TRASHY YARD LANDS OLD LADY IN SLAMMER 
</HEADLINE>
 2TAKES-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY DONALD BRADLEY   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Holly Steinhauser, an assistant city attorney
for Kansas City, says Frances Jane Todd is ``a sweet old lady.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Todd, 76, grandmother of 33, responds: ``Well, then why
did she throw me in the pokey?''
</P>
<P>
   Since Aug. 30, Todd has been the oldest inmate at Kansas City's
Municipal Correctional Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Her crime: a trashy yard.
</P>
<P>
   Steinhauser sued Todd on behalf of the city for numerous
nuisance violations. Ninety days after the verdict, because the
yard still had not been cleaned, a judge found Todd in contempt.
</P>
<P>
   And Todd found herself behind bars for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   When offered a color choice of jail suit, she chose green to
match her hazel eyes.
</P>
<P>
   She'll wear that suit every day until someone cleans up the
mess. So far, the grown relatives who live with her have been slow
to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   Todd and Steinhauser are opposites in this case and, seemingly,
opposites in life. Todd works as a school bus monitor so she can
pay off her house before retiring. Steinhauser is a 29-year-old
attorney just starting a career in government.
</P>
<P>
   But they share a beginning. Both were born to farmers in the
Ozark hills. They come from a culture where people tolerate junk on
the porch, brush in the yard and a broken-down vehicle out front.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that Todd still lives that way and Steinhauser
has an office on the 27th floor at City Hall. Steinhauser's sole
duty as the city's first ``neighborhood-improvement attorney'' is
to go after chronic property code violators.
</P>
<P>
   Steinhauser sees the irony: Todd's house isn't much worse than
many where she grew up, including her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't feel bad about throwing her in jail,'' Steinhauser
said. ``She had every opportunity to do what she was supposed to
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``And she won't get out until that yard is cleaned up.''
</P>
<P>
   Having explained the legal case, Steinhauser leaned forward in
her office chair and spoke of her true outrage.
</P>
<P>
   Four other adults, sometimes five, live in Todd's house in south
Kansas City. There is Todd's 41-year-old daughter, two grown
grandchildren, ages 19 and 23, and a family friend in his 40s.
Todd's 41-year-old son stays there part time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Able-bodied adults,'' Steinhauser calls them. She says it
would take the bunch two hours and a pickup to do enough work to
get Todd released.
</P>
<P>
   ``But getting this 76-year-old woman out of jail does not seem
to be a high priority for these people,'' Steinhauser said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've asked them, `Why don't you clean this junk up so your
mother can come home?' &UR; ''
</P>
<P>
   ``They won't do it. That's why this case is so egregious.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinhauser can't get the relatives in court because Todd holds
title to the property.
</P>
<P>
   Todd's daughter, Shirin McCormick, accuses Steinhauser of
``nitpicking'' and says the complaint against her mother is highly
exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   She contends the family has done almost everything Steinhauser
demanded.
</P>
<P>
   Steinhauser says they haven't made a dent.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, McCormick gave a tour of the property.
</P>
<P>
   In the driveway sat a broken-down, jacked-up 1988 station wagon
with a smashed front end. Milk jugs filled with motor oil lay under
the bushes. Used tires, rotten lumber, old plywood, concrete blocks
littered the back yard. Some clothes hung on the line; some had
blown into the weeds.
</P>
<P>
   And right in the middle of it all: a wooden dog house that
somebody had taken an ax to.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've cleaned things up around here a lot,'' McCormick said.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should have seen it before,'' Jacque Elliot said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if her family was doing its best to bring her home,
Todd looked at the ground a long moment and then thumbed her inmate
identification bracelet before answering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' she finally said. ``Maybe they are dragging their feet
a little.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all living there at my expense. I guess I ought to get
them to have a family reunion and pick things up so I can get out
of jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd admits her home could use some sprucing up, but she says
her biggest crime is being a hillbilly.
</P>
<P>
   She grew up in the mountains of northern Arkansas _ on a farm
near Calico Rock. It was fairly common for people in Izard County
back then to have a little junk sitting around the place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody ever said nothing,'' Todd said.
</P>
<P>
   She married and divorced the same man three times, and the
couple had nine children.
</P>
<P>
   The family gave up farming when her husband ``lost his shirt
trying to grow cotton on that hill.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, they made their way to Kansas City. Todd would work
20 years for the Social Security Administration. In 1976 she bought
her yellow three-bedroom ranch home near 110th Street and Booth
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   She makes no apologies for the scuffed wood floor and the four
linoleum patterns patched together in the kitchen. Or for the 1971
calendar that hangs in the living room.
</P>
<P>
   She's comfortable. As is the beagle that sleeps on the porch and
the kittens that hop through the flower bed. And those aren't weeds
out back. They're greens. She cooks them, and her family eats them.
</P>
<P>
   Steinhauser grew up on a farm near Norwood, Mo., just a few
mountains north of Calico Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Most everybody's house in the area needed paint and some people
had the same broken-down truck in their yard for 30 years,
Steinhauser said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down there, folks say, `Oh, that's just old Joe,'''
Steinhauser explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is Kansas City. You can't live that way in the big
city where people care about property values.''
</P>
<P>
   Her former business teacher at Norwood High School, Debbie
Shelton, used to take Steinhauser home from school. It was a
ramshackle farmhouse at the end of a two-mile driveway.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton described Steinhauser as an outspoken overachiever who,
even in grade school, itched to escape the hills.
</P>
<P>
   Steinhauser said she knew by the third grade that she wanted to
be lawyer. As a rebellious teen-ager, she moved out of her parents'
home during her senior year and worked part time at a shoe factory.
</P>
<P>
   ``You learn real quick that being on your own is not all fun,''
she said. ``That's when I learned about personal responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I do now is work with people who are irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Before she was hired in May 1998 to pursue property owners who
have long histories of code violations, the city lacked enforcement
muscle. Owners often paid fines but never fixed the problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time cases come to me, these people have been given
every chance to clean things up,'' Steinhauser said.
</P>
<P>
   Steinhauser's weapon is the civil lawsuit. She asks the court
for an injunction, which forces a defendant into a courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   If a judge agrees with Steinhauser, the homeowner receives time
to clean up the property. If no cleanup occurs, a judge can find
the person in contempt and order him or her to jail.
</P>
<P>
   Steinhauser has more than 200 cases.
</P>
<P>
   City Councilman Jim Rowland is such a fan of Steinhauser's work
that he is searching for ways to hire more attorneys like her.

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ For far too long, Rowland said, the city had
been powerless against homeowners and landlords who trashed
residences at their neighbors' expense and frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holly is a great example of how to fight back,'' Rowland said.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Todd was filed Oct. 2, 1998. She was in jail 10
months later.
</P>
<P>
   Steinhauser said, ``It shows how serious we are and how far we
are willing to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Her boss, City Attorney Walt O'Toole, said Todd had the means to
clean up her property and failed to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jail is the remedy the court provides,'' O'Toole said.
</P>
<P>
   Todd isn't bitter at Steinhauser.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's real nice,'' Todd said. ``She's a conscientious person
who's trying to do her job. Maybe I just don't fit in this city.''
</P>
<P>
   Could be, her daughter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom is used to the country where folks leave you alone,''
McCormick said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Todd rises at 5 a.m. at the correctional institution
and leaves an hour later for her job as bus monitor for the
Grandview School District. Her bus serves the district's
special-needs children. She's known some of them several years and
watched them grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a great lady and the kids like her,'' said Chuck
Cornforth, the district's director of transportation. ``She shows
up every day on time _ even now.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd returns to jail about 6 p.m., changes into her green suit,
visits a little and gets ready for bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those beds are hard,'' she said. ``If that pad _ I won't call
it a mattress _ ever had any buoyancy it was a long time ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``My bones are achy.''
</P>
<P>
   But being an inmate isn't so bad, she said. The people who work
at the correctional institution are friendly. Some even call her
``Grandma.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Leazer, director of inmate services, said some employees
suggested that inmates assigned to ``community service'' be sent to
clean up Todd's yard.
</P>
<P>
   Leazer told them that wouldn't be a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   So for now, there is no end in sight to nights on a hard bed.
But Todd can dream.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is time to leave the city behind. Maybe a small house
in the country would bring peace. A porch for the dog and a place
to grow the flowers she loves.
</P>
<P>
   She nodded and smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, if I ever get out of the pokey, I may just head
south.''

DRIVER DIES AFTER SATURDAY CRASH

<TEXT>
<P>
   IRWINDALE, Calif. _ One of the two drivers involved in an
accident during Saturday night's Speed Truck Challenge race at
Irwindale Speedway has died.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Cowherd, 49, of Phoenix, Ariz., was pronounced dead less
than one hour after he and Shawn Davidson of Mammoth Lakes were
involved in a crash entering the first turn of the eighth lap of
the scheduled 50-lap race.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the race, the main event on the program, was
canceled following the mishap.
</P>
<P>
   Cowherd died from head injuries suffered in the accident, which
occurred shortly before 10:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   He was treated by a doctor and paramedics at the track and was
then taken to Santa Teresita Hospital in Duarte. He was pronounced
dead at 11:25 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Cowherd is survived by his wife and three children.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson, who was flown by helicopter to Huntington Memorial
Hospital in Pasadena, was treated in the emergency room and
released early Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hearts go out to Keith's family and friends,'' said Robert
DeFazio, general manager of the track. ``We are all very saddened
by this loss.''
</P>
<P>
   The race involved stock racing cars with fiberglass bodies built
to resemble pickups. Cowherd and Davidson each were driving
Chevrolet S-10 pickups.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers in the race wore fireproof suits and helmets and were
constrained by five-point seat belts.
</P>
<P>
   The fatality was the second this year at the newly opened
speedway. Driver Casey Diemert, 23, died in March while practicing
for opening night at the track.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's accident occurred when Cowher and Davidson, running
sixth and seventh at the time, came together and became entangled.
Cowherd's truck slammed into the infield wall, while Davidson hit
the outside wall. Davidson, whose vehicle caught fire momentarily,
quickly climbed out of his vehicle and collapsed on the track.
</P>
<P>
   Cowherd needed to be removed from his vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The accident sent what was left of the crowd of 5,254 into a
stunned silence and the remaining 42 laps of the race were
canceled.

 By EDDIE SEFKO  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
BROOKLINE, Mass. _ A monster putt. A monster comeback. Heroes as
big as Texas. And a celebration to match.
<TEXT>
<P>
   They were all part of the United States' astounding comeback to
win the 33rd Ryder Cup on Sunday at The Country Club as Justin
Leonard's 45-foot putt on the 17th hole completed an unprecedented
rally that was equal parts shocking and relieving for the heavily
favored red, white and blue.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. squad took the Ryder Cup from the Europeans 14{ to 13{,
winning it for the first time since 1993. They won 8{ points in the
12 singles matches Sunday, erasing Europe's four-point advantage
after the first two days.
</P>
<P>
   And the reclamation had a heaping portion of Lone Star history
to it. Though it ranks below ``Remember the Alamo'' in historical
significance, Sunday's relentless pounding of sensational golf
shots was generated in part by that crucial piece of Texas history.
</P>
<P>
   Austin's Ben Crenshaw enlisted the help of Gov. George W. Bush,
who during a team meeting Saturday night read a speech by William
Barrett Travis about the famed battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great speech, great words,'' Crenshaw said. ``And
believe me, the first line of it _ `We were besieged by the enemy,'
_ we were at the time. And against some pretty insurmountable odds.
But darned if we didn't pull it off.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team swept the first six matches Sunday in singles
competition, then Dallas' Leonard rolled in the huge birdie putt
that clinched the Cup. Actually, it wasn't clinched until Jose
Maria Olazabal missed his birdie try to give Leonard the 17th hole,
a 1-up lead in their match and a guaranteed half-point, which was
all the U.S. team lacked to win the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans commenced partying like it was 1999, forcing
Olazabal to wait until the celebration died down before getting a
chance to stroke his potentially tying putt. Olazabal missed, and
the Cup was back in U.S. hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like there was a force pulling us together,'' Crenshaw
said. ``I don't know why it happened. But I do know how it
happened. These guys made it happen. They are very, very talented.
And they never doubted one time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans had been written off as impossibly behind after
falling in arrears 10-6 after Saturday's matches. No team ever had
overcome more than a two-point deficit on the last day in the first
32 Ryder Cup competitions.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team members were staring at the ignominy of being on
the wrong end of the biggest upset in golfing history. They were
the self-described 12 greatest players on the planet. And when it
was done, it was hard to dispute that the Americans were the
greatest team of individuals ever assembled.
</P>
<P>
   Their trip to destiny was wild. It was staged with a relentless
pounding of outstanding shots. Crenshaw had loaded the first half
of his singles matches with his strongest players, and Tom Lehman,
David Duval, Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson and Davis Love III rolled
up big early leads.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first four or five matches had to go out in a good fashion
in order to breed a chain reaction for the rest of the team,''
Crenshaw said. ``And it happened like a dream.''
</P>
<P>
   After that, it became a matter of scratching out 2{ more points
in the final six singles. Buoyed by the early showing of their
teammates, the players in the last six singles responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to the course about the time the first group was going
off,'' said Jeff Maggert of The Woodlands, who was in the final
pairing Sunday. ``You could see the 1s turning to 2s and 3s and 4s
on the scoreboard in our favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the Europeans) definitely thought about that, for sure.
When you look at a scoreboard and see that, then you know there's
more pressure on you.''
</P>
<P>
   Said European captain Mark James: ``They came out screeching.
And then it got to the stage where I thought we must hole something
out and they must stop holing them. Then they holed a lot more. We
were outplayed. They rode the streak tremendously well.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Pate won his match against Miguel Angel Jimenez 2 and 1
for America's 13th point. Then Jim Furyk ran away from Sergio
Garcia for a 4 and 3 victory. That left the U.S. team a point away.
Paul Lawrie had dispatched Maggert for Europe's first point.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the U.S. team was tied in each of the remaining
three matches with holes quickly running out. A half in any of
those matches would assure the Cup for the U.S.; Europe needed only
to win 14 points to retain the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   First, Mark O'Meara couldn't hold on to his match as he bogeyed
the final hole to give Padraig Harrington a 1-up win, leaving the
U.S. ahead 14-12.
</P>
<P>
   That left all the drama on the 17th green. With Colin
Montgomerie and Payne Stewart standing back in the fairway in an
all-square match as the last group on the course, they watched
Leonard ram his putt up a ridge and into the cup.
</P>
<P>
   As the hysteria quieted and Olazabal missed, it meant the worst
Leonard could get was a tie in his match and the half-point needed
to win the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   He lost the 18th hole when Olazabal birdied, but the damage was
done. Stewart conceded birdie to Montgomerie on the 18th to provide
the final score.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been extremely difficult not just for me but for my
colleagues as well,'' said Montgomerie, Europe's team leader. ``We
came in here as massive underdogs at the start of the week, massive
underdogs. What we did the first two days was almost
unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Americans were too good Sunday. It was play like
Leonard's that typified the Yanks' grit. He was four holes down to
Olazabal with seven to play. But Olazabal made bogeys at the 12th
and 13th to wedge open the door for Leonard. Then Leonard birdied
the 14th and 15th, and the match was even.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you win a hole or two in a row, the momentum
shifts,'' Leonard said. ``And even though I was still 2 down, I
felt like I was in the driver's seat going up to the 14th.''
</P>
<P>
   As were the Americans, as it turned out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never knew how good it would feel to win the Ryder Cup,''
Woods said. ``We did it the right way, with heart and
determination.''
</P>
<P>
   And great play. Not to mention a Texas touch to the whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Ben being captain and Justin's comeback, it's a great day
for us Texans,'' Maggert said. ``We've got a lot of great golf
history in Texas, and this is another piece of it.''

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Justin Leonard's putt crossed 45 feet and an
ocean of emotion wider than the Atlantic that, along with quite a
few centuries of cultural diversity, separates the two sides in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   It climbed the hill, broke right, rolled straight into the
center of the cup and touched off the wildest scene on a golf
course since Rodney Dangerfield teed it up in Caddyshack.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard bolted toward the front of the green like a drum major
on amphetamines, and a band of delirious American players, caddies,
wives and girlfriends fell in behind in a victory conga line.
</P>
<P>
   Could this be the genteel game of golf?
</P>
<P>
   Only if what is on the line is the Ryder Cup, a historic and, of
late, compelling competition that is equal part sports, patriotic
fervor and theater.
</P>
<P>
   Where else can you get the automatons of the PGA Tour to let us
know they sweat and bleed just like humans?
</P>
<P>
   There was Tiger Woods, wearing his rally cap backward and
squinting through his sunglasses, willing on his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   There was usually stoic David Duval finishing off a cleaning of
Jesper Parnevik's clock by pumping his fists and cupping his ear to
incite more of the crowd's roar.
</P>
<P>
   There was the U.S. team swarming over the lush grass of The
Country Club like a plague of locusts to swallow up a 14{-13{ win
to complete the greatest last-day performance in the history of the
event.
</P>
<P>
   And there ultimately, and so dramatically, was the skinny Texan
Leonard ramming home a putt from just inside the Rhode Island
border that enabled him to come from four holes down to tie Jose
Maria Olazabal and clinch the Ryder Cup for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   There were so many heroes Sunday. Hal Sutton, the veteran who
had not qualified for Ryder Cup play in a dozen years, finished a
strong effort by getting 3{ points for his team. Tom Lehman set the
tone by coming out strong in the first match of the day to defeat
Lee Westwood.
</P>
<P>
   And Jim Furyk put a wet blanket over the Spanish firecracker
Sergio Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Leonard, who halved his duel with Olazabal and still
never has won a Ryder Cup match outright, hitting the long dream of
a putt that will be replayed longer than any shot he has ever made
in a successful career, which includes winning the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I was trying to make it, but I don't know if I was
really expecting to make it,'' Leonard said. ``The first thing I
wanted to do was to get it close.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard's day, down four to Olazabal with just seven holes to
play, was representative of the rally that saw the U.S. team come
out of what seemed to be a too-deep 10-6 hole entering singles
play. No team in the event's history had come that far back.
</P>
<P>
   But who knew the entire European continent was going to turn
into the Oilers at Buffalo? And who knew the U.S. team could almost
fulfill the prophecy of their captain/historian/seer Ben Crenshaw
and nearly ``whitewash'' the Europeans?
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw pulled out every motivational tool in his bag to stoke
the fires of his boys. There were Saturday night speeches that
quoted William Barrett Travis at the Alamo and Crenshaw's golf
mentor, the late Harvey Penick.
</P>
<P>
   There were pats on the back, talk about fate and even a history
lesson about No. 17 itself, the site at The Country Club where a
neighborhood kid named Francis Ouimet sank a pair of 20-footers in
the 1913 U.S. Open to upset golf legends Harry Vardon and Ted Ray
to become one of the game's immortals.
</P>
<P>
   You weren't sure if Crenshaw was writing the script for a
miracle finish or an episode of The X Files. Nevertheless, it all
worked.
</P>
<P>
   Westwood and Darren Clarke couldn't get Europe the one point it
needed out of the first two slots, then what had been the dynamic
team of Garcia and Parnevik fell flat individually.
</P>
<P>
   And the U.S. team became a boulder rolling down a hill.
</P>
<P>
   What is interesting is that by underperforming on the first two
days, the self-proclaimed ``12 best players in the world'' turned
the tables and set themselves up to be the come-from-behind
feel-good story. Kind of like Microsoft being cheered for its stock
price rising.
</P>
<P>
   What made the aftermath tense was the Europeans expressing
``disgust'' at the U.S. frat party around the 17th green while
Olazabal still had a 25-foot putt to halve the hole.
</P>
<P>
   What makes it all so incredibly delicious is that in the last
seven meetings, the sides have won three each and tied once, and
the combined point total is 98-98 heading to The Belfry in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't golf. It's the Ryder Cup.

DON'T GIVE UP ON MATADORS JUST YET

<P>
   CHENEY, Wash. _ In these days of instant gratification, where
most food is served fast and the remote control allows us to zoom
through several TV channels in a matter of seconds, it would be
easy to bury the Cal State Northridge football team.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors have lost two consecutive games. Defensively,
they've given up 119 points and 1,225 yards in those losses. The
57-point drubbing at Kansas two weeks ago was the second-worst in
school history.
</P>
<P>
   Then Eastern Washington set a team record with 456 rushing yards
and beat CSUN 48-41 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   That's why it is tempting to criticize the Matadors, or even
worse, to think ``It's the same old CSUN,'' because, after all,
isn't this a program that entered the season 43 games under .500?
</P>
<P>
   This is a new era in Northridge. Thanks to last year's promising
season, when the Matadors were less than a minute away from winning
a share of the Big Sky Conference title, the bar has been raised.
The team closes most of its practices by calling itself ``Big Sky
champs.''
</P>
<P>
   But let's look at reality.
</P>
<P>
   Put the ugliness of these back-to-back losses aside. CSUN lost
its head coach and offensive coordinator in July. The remaining
staff lost almost two weeks of work this summer when the coaches'
office was locked during the school's internal investigation into
the program.
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't the mass exodus of players some predicted. Wide
receiver Anthony Ramos, who transferred to Washington State, was
the only prominent Matador to leave. But Ron Ponciano's firing put
doubt in many players' minds about the university's support of the
football team.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors were picked to finish eighth, next to last, in a
poll of the conference coaches.
</P>
<P>
   So what were they doing pushing talented and experienced Eastern
Washington into the last minute on Saturday?
</P>
<P>
   Let's not bury the Matadors. Let's praise them.
</P>
<P>
   __ Sophomore quarterback Marcus Brady, after two so-so efforts
to start the year, completed 36 of 49 passes for 484 yards and five
touchdowns; Eastern Washington simply could not defend him and he
didn't throw an interception.
</P>
<P>
   __ Senior wide receiver Aaron Arnold caught 10 of Brady's passes
for 130 yards and became the school's all-time leader in receiving
yards on a 33-yard pass that set up Brady's 7-yard touchdown pass
to Drew Amerson that pulled CSUN within a touchdown, 41-34.
</P>
<P>
   When Arnold came into the program in '96, he was so raw some of
the coaches didn't think he could play in college. This year he was
a preseason Division I-AA All-American candidate.
</P>
<P>
   __ Shawnbay Jones, a defensive lineman, had a team-leading 12
tackles against EWU, including a sack in the third quarter that
almost sent Eagles quarterback Chris Samms to the locker room with
an ankle injury.
</P>
<P>
   __ The Eagles had 271 yards rushing in the first half. But a few
adjustments by the coaches and inspired play by Jones, backup
noseguard Sean Beard and linebacker Cos Abercrombie, held the
Eagles to 40 yards in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   __ Most important, CSUN fought Eastern Washington until the end
without senior running back Jaumal Bradley, who didn't play because
of tonsillitis. Even though Bradley has become one of the
conference's top tailbacks, he is also the team's leader, its
conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Abercrombie, Arnold and Brady made no excuses for Bradley's
absence.
</P>
<P>
   As the players filed out of the cramped visitor's locker room
Saturday night, Arnold pointed out that there is hope for the
Matadors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm optimistic about the rest of the season,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold should know, because in the four years he's been at
Northridge, he's seen the Matadors consistently prove their critics
wrong. He knows a season isn't over after three games. &QL; 
REPORT CARD &QL; 
Game: 3 &QL; 
Result: Eastern Washington 48, CSUN 41 &QL; 
Record: 1-2 &QL; 
This week's GPA: 2.41 &QL; 
Cumulative GPA: 2.44 &QL; 
QUARTERBACK &QL; 
Marcus Brady is back. After subpar performance against Kansas,
Brady showed why he could be the Big Sky's premier QB. He completed
73 percent of his passes (36 of 49) for a personal-best 484 yards
and 5 TDs, with no INTs. Orchestrated nine-play, 85-yard drive at
the end that took only a minute and a half. Bravo. &QL; 
Grade: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A &QL; 
RUNNING BACKS &QL; 
Starter Jaumal Bradley didn't play because of sickness and it
showed; Brady was leading rusher, with 29 yards. Alan Taylor, who
started in place of Bradley, had 21 yards and DeJuan Gilmore wasn't
much better, with 23. To be fair, these guys didn't have much room
to work with. &QL; 
Grade: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   C- &QL; 
RECEIVERS &QL; 
The play of AA (Aaron Arnold) could have earned this position an A,
and Terrence Jones (six receptions, 138 yards, two TDs) was even
better. But two lost fumbles by Drew Amerson, including a
heartbreaker at the end of a 22-yard catch deep in EWU territory in
the fourth quarter, cannot be overlooked. &QL; 
Grade: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   B+ &QL; 
OFFENSIVE LINE &QL; 
Decimated by injuries, this unit was average. Brady was sacked four
times, pressured many times and hit hard after several passes.
Created nothing for the running backs, even though EWU's defensive
line was smaller. &QL; 
Grade: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   C- &QL; 
DEFENSIVE LINE &QL; 
Horrible in the first half, inspired in the second. Eastern
Washington has one of the best offensive lines in the Big Sky, but
456 rushing yards is inexcusable. Some of those holes opened up for
EWU running backs were wide enough for two players to run through. &QL; 
Grade: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   C- &QL; 
LINEBACKERS &QL; 
Brennen Swanson was double- and triple-teamed, and he wasn't really
a factor despite six unassisted tackles. Cos Abercrombie woke from
his two-game slumber and had a season-high 11 tackles. Jack Heaslet
had his first INT as a Matador on a horrible throw by EWU's Chris
Samms. &QL; 
Grade: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   C &QL; 
DEFENSIVE BACKS &QL; 
Samms, filling in for injured starter Fred Salanoa, was no factor
and the Eagles ran the ball 61 times. Was run-support a priority?
It didn't appear to be. Too many missed tackles and sometimes EWU's
RBs ran right by the DBs. Free safety Rahman Sparks (12 tackles and
1 sack) played well. &QL; 
Grade: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   D &QL; 
SPECIAL TEAMS &QL; 
Terrence Jones' 86-yard kickoff return for a TD to open the game
was CSUN's first since 1991. Jones needs to be smarter on punt
returns, though; he had his second negative return in as many
games. Ethan Beck averaged 45 yards per punt. K Derek Brown missed
an extra point, which could have been devastating if the Matadors
had tied the game in the last two minutes. &QL; 
Grade: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   B+ &QL; 
COACHING &QL; 
These guys are trying, but it's hard to look good when CSUN brings
only eight healthy offensive linemen and is without promising
strong safety Hassan Abdul-Malik (pulled hamstring). Those excuses
aside, adjustments need to be made to get Swanson free and get the
penalties (33 in three games) under control. &QL; 
Grade: &QL;

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
MILWAUKEE _ If the Astros are to hold on and reach the playoffs,
they're going to have to do it the hard way.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Astros' drive for a third straight National League Central
title is no longer a sure thing. Neither is making the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   They continued their late-season tailspin Sunday, completing a
disastrous road trip with an 11-3 loss to the Milwaukee Brewers at
County Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros lost for the sixth time on the nine-game road trip,
reducing their lead over Cincinnati to a half-game in the NL
Central and setting up a two-game showdown between the clubs
beginning Tuesday at the Astrodome. The Reds rallied past St. Louis
7-5 in 12 innings Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was one of those days you have during the season, but you
hate to have them at this juncture,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker
said. ``Our pitching was really poor, and our hitting wasn't that
great, either. We got a lot of hits but not many runs. It was a
terrible trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Righthander Scott Elarton (9-5), pitching in arguably the most
important game of the season to date, was gone by the fourth
inning. The Astros' bullpen was equally ineffective. Offensively,
the Astros stranded 11 baserunners.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee built an 8-1 lead after only four innings en route to
a 16-hit assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitching and offense on this trip was either real good or real
bad. Never together,'' Astros first baseman Jeff Bagwell said.
``That's why we've been struggling.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Brewers _ the Astros' third straight sub-.500
opponent on the trip _ played the spoiler's role. Marquis Grissom
went 4-for-6 with a home run, three runs scored and five RBIs, and
rookie righthander Kyle Peterson (3-7) held the Astros to two runs
over six innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting because it was against a team in the middle of
the pennant race,'' Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
   Elarton, who has provided a lift for the rotation as the No. 4
starter in the second half, suffered through his shortest outing
since becoming a starter July 3. He gave up five runs and seven
hits in 2 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers tagged Elarton for four runs in the second inning.
Jeromy Burnitz led off the inning with a double, and Geoff Jenkins
singled. Ron Belliard's single scored Burnitz, and Brian Banks
singled to load the bases. With two outs, Grissom delivered the big
blow with a three-run double that rolled to the left-center-field
wall.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Cirillo led off the third inning with a home run _ his 14th
of the season _ off Elarton to put the Brewers ahead 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt good warming up in the bullpen,'' Elarton said. ``I
came out thinking I had pretty decent stuff, but then I realized
pretty early I didn't have anything to put anybody away with. My
fastball was pretty straight. My breaking ball and changeup were
flat. It's hard to pitch with that kind of stuff. I battled as long
as I could. It just wasn't meant to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Elarton said there was no extra pressure on the mound with the
Astros fighting to stay atop the division.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an important game. I knew that,'' he said. ``I'd rather
pitch in a really important game than a game that really has no
meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Holt, who replaced Elarton, had his second rough relief
outing of the series. Holt allowed three runs and two walks over
two-thirds of an inning, including a two-run double by Jenkins in
the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Grissom added a solo home run in the fifth off Brian Williams to
extend Milwaukee's lead to 9-1, and had an RBI double in the
seventh. Grissom entered the game in a 0-for-10 slump.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Spiers, who was attacked by a fan in right field Friday
night, started in left field Sunday and had a run-scoring single in
the third. Russ Johnson had an RBI pinch-hit single in the sixth,
and the Astros scored their final run on a bases-loaded walk to
Ricky Gutierrez in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a bad trip for us,'' Gutierrez said. ``We didn't play
good baseball. We didn't do anything really good.''

DID U.S. WIN ONE FOR THE QUIPPER?
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Before the champagne dries on Ben Crenshaw's matted-down fringe
of hair, something oughta be considered before the Ryder Cup
competition rides across the pond to someplace called The Belfry in
2001:
</P>
<P>
   Replace cryin' captain C'shaw with TV golf evangelist Johnny
Miller.
</P>
<P>
   'Cause if it weren't for Miller's straight-shootin' comments on
the NBC telecast during Saturday afternoon's dreadful U.S.
exhibition, Crenshaw wouldn't have had any material to use to help
fire up his dirty dozen on Saturday night after the stupid
four-ball competition was over and good ol' American one-on-one
play started.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Justin) Leonard doesn't have anything going for him. . . . My
hunch is Leonard needs to go home and watch it on TV,'' Miller
assessed when he heard Gentle Ben was going with a hunch and
passing up Jeff Maggert (who asked to sit, by the way) for
Saturday's late matches to go with a guy who missed a few critical
morning putts.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard responded Sunday with his flat stick along with some
unflattering response directed at Miller: ``I'm not going home.''
</P>
<P>
   Mission accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Miller tried to take the reverse criticism with some humor, and
he was much more subdued on the air late Sunday after watching the
remarkable comeback. Maybe because the victory meant something to
him, too, even though the network told its guys not to be homers on
the telecast.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Crenshaw can stay as captain. Just as long as NBC
televises the event in two years _ and brings along Miller.
</P>
<P>
   __ NBC's Jim Gray gushed in front of Crenshaw, his wife and
daughter: ``We can see you all have tears in your eyes right now.''
The daughter said loud enough for the mike to pick it up: ``I
don't.'' Gray didn't have a follow-up for her. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ Rumor was that the Americans were so desperate after the
first two days that an INS agent was hired to try to encourage
defections. Except for Monty. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ How much does the U.S. team deserve to be paid after this?
They've got two years to negotiate. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ Fashion-police violation: No more letting the U.S. players'
wives and girlfriends not only dress alike, but color-coordinate
with the guys. There's nothing to coordinate with those tablecloths
the players wore Sunday. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ Marvin, hey what 'cha doin' now? Take that $1 billion that's
burning a hole in your pocket and buy your kids an Arena League
trinket instead. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ Stephen Davis is NOT someone you thought about drafting on
your rotisserie team. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ We heard the thing that impressed Cal fans most about
freshman QB Kyle Boller was when he dropped Arizona State's
231-pound defensive end !Eric Fields with a solo tackle to prevent
him from returning a fumble into what could have been a
game-winning touchdown late in Saturday's contest. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ Whine-a-like lookalikes: Rich Neuheisel and Danny Ainge. . .
.
</P>
<P>
   __ There IS a new Lakers uniform and it'll be unveiled this
week. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ Tim Belcher, who started the decade with the Dodgers and will
end it as property of the Angels, will finish with the most losses
(115) and second-most home runs allowed (226) among all big-league
pitchers in the '90s. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ Someone mentioned in ``For Love of the Game'' it's
unbelievable that Kevin Costner's character, Billy Chapel, has an
8-11 record despite his 3.55 ERA. One, he pitches for the Tigers.
Two, Houston's Nolan Ryan won the ERA title in 1987 (2.76) and led
the league in Ks (270) to go with his 8-16 mark. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ For the record, the Daily News extended an invitation to
Felix Trinidad to swing by the office and watch a tape of his
recent victory over Oscar De La Hoya. He respectfully declined but
offered the following quote: ``I still think I won. . . . Did you
think I'd change my mind or something?''

   LOS ANGELES _ As the year 2000 approaches, here's a look at some

EX-BOYFRIEND KILLS BRIDE ON WEDDING DAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for inserts, rewriting throughout) (sw) 
 By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A bride-to-be was shot dead in front of her family on Sunday by
a former boyfriend who walked uninvited into her New Jersey home as
the family was about to leave for the wedding, the authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   The former boyfriend, dressed as if for a wedding, walked in
about 4 p.m. as the woman was posing for a final round of
photographs, pulled a gun out of a briefcase and shot her
repeatedly, prosecutors said. He was immediately restrained by the
bride's brother, who held him until the police arrived, the
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   As a white Rolls-Royce and two stretch limousines for the
wedding party idled outside the home that the woman, Gladys Ricart,
39, shared with her 20-year-old son and her mother, the gunfire
sent a houseful of guests scrambling for cover, hiding in closets
and running down to the basement, said the Bergen County
prosecutor, William H. Schmidt.
</P>
<P>
   The former boyfriend, Augustin Garcia, was arrested at the scene
_ a quiet street in the small Bergen County town of Ridgefield, and
was expected to be charged with murder, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street, a neighbor who heard her dog bark came out to
see what the commotion was about and saw bridesmaids in light green
and champagne dresses running onto the lawn. ``They ran over to my
steps and sat down, and they were crying,'' said the woman, who
would not disclose her name.
</P>
<P>
   A flower girl for the wedding was whisked into a neighbor's
house to get her away from the violence, the woman said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ricart's fiance, James L. Preston, 36, of Brooklyn, was to
meet her for the ceremony at the Church on the Hill in Flushing,
Queens, and was not present when the shooting occurred, the
authorities said. A message left on Preston's answering machine
Sunday night was not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ricart and Garcia, 47, of North Bergen, N.J., had dated for
about six years and had broken up nine months ago, Schmidt said.
``She terminated the relationship and had no desire to resume it or
have contact with him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a question, Schmidt refused to say whether Garcia
had been stalking Ms. Ricart or whether she had an order of
protection against him. Rafael Heres, a relative of Ms. Ricart's
who was at the house, told a local television stateion that Garcia
was deeply troubled. ``We already knew the guy's background, and we
figured that the phenomena would occur,'' he said. ``He was a
little negative. He couldn't accept rejection.''
</P>
<P>
   Another family friend, Fior Martinez, told reporters that Garcia
had left 100 roses on Ms. Ricart's lawn last week. Ms. Ricart had
met Preston about four months ago, Schmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the shooting, Ms. Ricart was standing on her lawn
on Elizabeth Street, a sycamore-shaded block of tidy houses in a
town of 10,000 people five miles west of New York City, posing for
pictures and waving to neighbors. She was wearing a lacy white gown
and a silver tiara and was flanked by nine bridesmaids and three
flower girls, said Janet Donnelly, who lives across the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``She looked absolutely gorgeous,'' Ms. Donnelly said. ``She
seemed nervous, but that's normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon Ms. Ricart and the photographer went back in the house, Ms.
Donnelly said.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, Garcia apparently drove up in his black
sport utility vehicle, parked and walked into 825 Elizabeth, a
two-family, brick-faced home where Ms. Ricart lived with her son,
Davis Ricart, and her mother, Anna Rosario, Schmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the guests recognized Garcia when he entered, Schmidt
said. He would not say whether they asked Garcia to leave. When
Garcia found Ms. Ricart modeling her wedding dress for the
photographer, he shot her ``several times,'' Schmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   The bride's brother immediately took the gun, a five-shot,
.38-caliber revolver and held Garcia at gunpoint until the police
arrived, Schmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He grabbed the gun away as the gunman was reloading,'' Schmidt
added.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Donnelly said she ran back outside when she heard noise and
saw confusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were running around screaming,'' she said. Ms. Ricart's
distraught mother collapsed in the middle of the street.

DODGERS THANK FANS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was Fan Appreciation Day at Dodgers Stadium
Sunday, and the team gave away many lovely parting gifts team
merchandise, barbecue grills, televisions, vacations to Europe,
free dinners, autographed jerseys, and cars, the latter perfect for
a quick getaway.
</P>
<P>
   The question is who's departing, if anyone.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers' 10-7 win over the San Diego Padres was
their home finale in a season that went wrong early and never
showed a flicker of life. The win Sunday was their seventh in their
last nine games, but they will still finish the year well under
.500, their worst season since the 63-99 1992 disaster. They also
posted only their fifth losing record at home in 41 years.
</P>
<P>
   Given the changes of last year and the high expectations of this
year, only the naive would think the same team will return in 1999.
But it would also be naive of Dodgers management to think all three
million fans are going to return in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers fans are a laid-back, patient lot. The Dodgers managed
to draw three million fans for the 14th time despite it being year
two of the Fox era (error?) and a year removed from the Mike Piazza
fiasco. That may be the club's best stat of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But the team shouldn't press its luck. These fans have opinions,
and they've been paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   June Blaine of Beverly Hills, who has been attending Dodgers
games since the team played in the Coliseum, said her first
priority is financial. ``Don't raise the ticket prices,'' she said,
clutching her $6 general admission ticket. ``And don't trade Eric
Karros. That last trade (Mike Piazza) was a real blooper.''
</P>
<P>
   Serg Talavera of Wilmington would like the team to return to the
good old pre-Fox days and allow mellow tailgating in some parking
lots. He and several friends were enjoying the noon sunshine before
finding their seats.
</P>
<P>
   Talavera also appeals for some patience regarding Raul Mondesi,
whose midseason blowup turned the old rousing ``Rauuuuul'' cheer
into boos. ``I don't want to see Raul traded,'' he said. ``He
helped the Dodgers a lot over the years. It bothers me that more
people don't appreciate him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabrina Wind of Santa Monica has been a rabid Dodger fan for
only five years, but the Piazza trade still left a mark. ``I felt
like a heartbroken 11-year-old when they traded Piazza,'' she said.
``If they traded Karros, it would seem like the end of tradition.
He was my first real crush as fan.''
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, she would like to see a change of personality on the
field. ``I'd like to see a team that plays well together, where the
personalities are well-matched,'' she said. ``And a team that has
some fun. They haven't looked at all this year like a team that was
having fun.''
</P>
<P>
   If three million fans is the best stat, Ms. Winds' no fun
observation may be the most accurate assessment.
</P>
<P>
   The other facet of Fan Appreciation Day was the players and
coaches greeting fans at entrance gates and thanking them for their
support. No one reported any rude remarks. ``They were very
gracious,'' said manager Davey Johnson. ``Nothing unkind was
said.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them thanked me for the season,'' said Karros. ``Some
wished me well during the offseason. And some fans thought I was
just some guy wearing a blue jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   There was also one Padre fans who told Karros ``We'll see you in
San Diego next year,'' a reference to the first baseman being
traded to his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Ross Perot will support NAFTA before the Dodgers and Padres make
a trade. But despite going into the last week of the season with a
career-high .299 average, a career-high 112 RBI and career-equaling
34 homers, he might not be back.
</P>
<P>
   Davey Johnson wants a left-handed bat, and Karros has eminently
more trade value than Mondesi or Gary Sheffield, who both make $9
million-plus a year.
</P>
<P>
   Trading Mondesi would make more sense. His numbers look as good
as Karros' 32 homers, 92 RBI, 33 stolen bases but no one would say
he had a great season, least of all the fans who turned on him. If
they don't deal him, they'll have to worry anew about fan reaction
in '00.
</P>
<P>
   But a Mondy deal has financial complications, and clubhouse
complications, since Sheffield has come out against a Mondesi
trade. Plus, Mondy could very easily go somewhere else and finally
turn in that monster season everyone's been waiting for.
</P>
<P>
   As frustrating as the '99 season has been, the offseason could
be more of the same. Johnson and G.M. Kevin Malone would love to
dump some of their ill-fitting pieces, but there may be no takers.
They could end up like a garbage scow with no place to dock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a frustrating year, especially when you consider the
expectations for this club,'' said Karros. ``It wasn't what we
wanted it to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Karros, Mondesi and Sheffield will finish with 30 homers and 90
RBI or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have good numbers in a season like this,'' Karros
said. ``But it shows how much of a team game it is and all the
different factors that go into winning. And that's how you're
identified, as a winner or a loser.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans should know that no one is more frustrated about
losing than the people in this (locker) room.''
</P>
<P>
   They know. They even understand. The question is for how long?

SHARING A NEEDLE RISKS MORE AIDS, HEPATITIS C `CO- 
 INFECTION'
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ Despite the success of needle exchange programs
in preventing the spread of AIDS among injection-drug users, a new
epidemic is emerging to threaten addicts with still another deadly
disease.
<P>
   Researchers call the problem ``co-infection,'' but to addicts on
the streets and in the hidden alleys of major cities, it means that
when they share needles they risk not only AIDS but also infection
with the hepatitis C virus that causes chronic liver disease and
fatal liver cancer.
</P>
<P>
   One of the earliest volunteer needle exchange efforts took place
in Vancouver, British Columbia, with vans roving inner-city streets
each night to bring clean needles and disinfectant to addicts
wherever they gathered.
</P>
<P>
   When some of the addicts who declined the free needles developed
AIDS and sought treatment at the city's clinics, doctors who
examined them began observing an increase in positive blood tests
for the hepatitis C virus.
</P>
<P>
   In February, a team at St. Paul's Hospital in Vancouver opened a
new AIDS clinic specifically aimed at testing and treating patients
who are co-infected with HIV, the AIDS virus, and the hepatitis C
virus.
</P>
<P>
   The clinic is keeping long-term records of its patients, and
some of its latest findings were reported in San Francisco Sunday
by Dr. Dwight Ferris of Vancouver at the opening of a meeting in
Moscone Center called the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial
Agents and Chemotherapy _ known to researchers as ICAAC.
</P>
<P>
   In a study comparing drug users who came to the clinic and
patients who did not inject drugs _ all of whom were infected by
the AIDS virus _ clinic doctors found that 100 percent of the
injection drug users were also infected with the hepatitis C virus,
while the virus showed up in only 25 percent of those who did not
inject drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The injection drug users were also much less likely than the
nonusers to be taking new and powerful combinations of anti-AIDS
medicines known as highly active anti-retroviral therapy, Ferris
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy alcohol drinking was also a distinctive characteristic of
the injection drug users who were co-infected with hepatitis C.
</P>
<P>
   The urgent need now, Ferris said, is to develop ``a new standard
of care for HIV-infected individuals with hepatitis,'' as well as
more effective strategies for treating the alcohol abusers among
them whose combination of afflictions poses a formidable challenge
for all AIDS caregivers.
</P>
<P>
   The huge ICAAC meeting, attended by more than 16,000 medical
researchers, drug company representatives and health care workers,
is expected to fill Moscone Center's immense exhibit halls and
conference rooms through Wednesday.

UP NEXT: COIT TOWER BY VIAGRA
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ Assorted gems, nuggets, pearls, jewels and the
occasional lump of coal:
<P>
   --``Does everything have a price now?'' asks Supervisor Michael
Yaki, referring to a proposal to sell advertising space on the
Golden Gate Bridge one day per month. ``And what's next? Half
Dome?''
</P>
<P>
   (Michael's hair by Vidal Sassoon.)
</P>
<P>
   Bulletin: Yosemite Inc. has announced a plan to cover park
revenue shortfall by renting Half Dome to advertisers. The park has
agreed to rename the monolith Chrome Dome and allow it to be used
as a dramatic before-and-after ``nature billboard'' co-sponsored by
Rogaine and Chia Pet.
</P>
<P>
   --``I saw Steve Young on a TV commercial talking to a bunch of
cows,'' e-mails Bolling. ``Does this mean he's going to be put out
to pasture?''
</P>
<P>
   You might be on to something, Bolling. In last week's game,
Steve did spend a lot of time on all fours with his nose in the
grass.
</P>
<P>
   And not to nitpick, but it's ``herd'' of cows, ``bunch'' of
horses.
</P>
<P>
   --Walking past In-Jean-ious on Castro, Steve Abney stopped to
read the T-shirts in the window. He liked, ``My parents told me I
could be anything, so I became an ass_.''
</P>
<P>
   Only in XL, no doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Don Novello reports that his Right Field Home Run Swimming Team
- dogs who will fetch homer balls from China Basin outside Pac Bell
Park _ is coming along swimmingly.
</P>
<P>
   Except: ``I'm training my own dog, Lassie Molinari _ half
dachshund, half Chihuahua. He's small (11/2-inch inseam), and I
doubt if he'll ever be able to get a baseball in his mouth. He's
trying, but so far he can only open his mouth as wide as an English
muffin.''
</P>
<P>
   Possible solution: a large wad of bubble gum stuck to Lassie's
forehead.
</P>
<P>
   _How about allowing ads on the Golden Gate Bridge, but only on
the underside.  &LR; Hello there, sailor. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Baseball revives the Dead? Bob Weir and Phil Lesh will sing the
National Anthem at the final Giants' game at 3Stick Park. Does this
mean that the Dead, scattered like a dandelion since Jerry Garcia's
death, might finally reunite for a millennium New Year's Eve gig?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible,'' says Dead spokesguy Dennis McNally. ``None of
them are committed elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   _A tip you won't get from Martha Stewart: Muni and the mayor are
trying to catch workers' compensation cheaters with hidden cameras
showing the cheats off the job doing stuff their disability does
not allow them to do.
</P>
<P>
   Former private eye Ron Cameron suggests this old trick: If the
guy (or gal) is out of work because he can't bend down (bad back,
etc.), pour half a can of motor oil under the person's car.
Revealing photo-op ensues.

 DIRECT PC SALES ARE INCREASING
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By HENRY NORR &LR;

</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Brands sold through local dealers still top the
charts in U.S. personal computer sales to consumers, but analysts
foresee an increasing share going to companies that sell directly
to users over the phone and the Web _ notably Dell and Gateway.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Compaq, which still markets most of its PCs through
dealers, held on to the No. 1 position, but Gateway finished the
year less than 1 percentage point behind, according to data
provided by IDC analyst Gabrielle Griffith.
</P>
<P>
   For 1999, Compaq and Gateway will most likely hold on to the top
two slots in the U.S. consumer market, analysts say, but Dell,
Gateway's longtime arch-rival in direct sales, is coming on strong.
Since August 1997, when Dell launched its first concerted
consumer-marketing campaign, its unit sales in this category have
been growing at a rate of 80 percent year-over-year, the company
says.
</P>
<P>
   By the second quarter of this year, the most recent for which
data are available, Dell had climbed to fifth rank in U.S. consumer
sales, according to IDC's Griffith; another analyst, ZD InfoBead's
David Tremblay, also had Dell in seventh position a year ago, but
his data show it climbing all the way to fourth in the most recent
quarter.

 MOMENTUM INVESTORS HAVE A NEW TOOL
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By HARRY DOMASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Investors using the Web to research stocks have
a new tool to help them gain insight into consensus earnings
forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   First, some background.
</P>
<P>
   I wrote a column back in June describing how momentum investors
could use information on Yahoo's research page to determine whether
a stock is likely to outperform or underperform the market in the
weeks leading up to release of quarterly earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Momentum investors, you may recall, look for trends in analysts'
consensus earnings forecasts. They're trying to spot stocks likely
to experience further increases in earnings forecasts or that are
likely to jump when the company reports earnings that are greater
than expected _ what's known as a positive earnings surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Negative surprises (earnings less than forecast) generally drive
a company's stock price down, often sharply.
</P>
<P>
   I used two stocks in the June column to demonstrate the
approach: Qualcomm and Parametric Technology. Our analysis
predicted good times ahead for Qualcomm and bad news for
Parametric. How did our predictions turn out?
</P>
<P>
   Qualcomm's June quarter earnings came in at 75 cents per share,
12 cents higher than estimates. Analysts responded by increasing
forecasts for the current (September) quarter from 63 cents to 75
cents per share. Qualcomm's share price responded accordingly,
soaring more than 74 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to our prediction that Parametric did not have much of
a chance of a positive surprise, it did manage to report June
quarter earnings 1 cent above consensus forecasts of 16 cents. That
didn't stop analysts from reducing estimates for the September
quarter to 17 cents, from 24 cents. Despite the drop in earnings
forecasts, Parametric's share price is up about 4 percent since the
column was published.
</P>
<P>
   I'm bringing all this up because Quicken (www.quicken.com)
recently added a new page to its site called ``Analysts'
Estimates.'' Quicken and Yahoo both get their data from Zacks
Investment Research, a Chicago area company that compiles analysts'
reports. Quicken's new page has everything Yahoo has, plus a new
feature: EPS Estimate Distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Let me explain how analysts' consensus forecasts are computed
before I go into the details. You would think, in this age of
supercomputers, the consensus numbers would reflect some sort of
sophisticated statistical processing of the forecasts. Some
companies do that. However, the published consensus forecasts, the
numbers that determine whether a company's earnings are a positive
or negative surprise, are simple averages.
</P>
<P>
   For example, say four analysts publish earnings forecasts for
Embalming.com. Three of the analysts predict Embalming.com will
earn $1 per share, and the fourth thinks the company will break
even, that is, show no profit or loss.
</P>
<P>
   The average of the four estimates is 75 cents. One thing you
know for sure, Embalming.com isn't going to earn 75 cents! Either
the analyst forecasting zero earnings knows something the others
don't, or he or she hasn't been paying attention. We don't know who
is right, but this is a completely different state of affairs than
if all four analysts were predicting 75 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Let's look at some real examples.
</P>
<P>
   Click on Investments on Quicken's home page, and then enter PTX,
the symbol for Pillowtex Corp., a manufacturer of home textile
furnishings, in the box under Quotes &AMP; Research. Select Analysts,
and then push Go (if your screen displays price quotes instead of
analyst ratings, select Analysts' Estimates from the menu on the
left).
</P>
<P>
   Scroll down until you see both the Consensus EPS Estimates and
the EPS Estimate Distribution on your screen at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus (average) of the six analysts' reporting estimates
for Pillowtex is 26 cents per share for the September '99 quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Now, look at the chart labeled ``This Quarter-09/1999,'' showing
the distribution of the six estimates. We see that four analysts
said 25 cents, one forecast 26 cents and the sixth predicts 28
cents. Four out of six analysts are saying Pillowtex will earn 25
cents per share in the September quarter. If they're right,
Pillowtex will come in below consensus and the share price will
probably drop.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus forecast for the fiscal year ending December '99
is $1.61 per share. Look at the chart labeled ``This
Year-12/1999.'' Five of the six analysts reporting forecasts say
Pillowtex will earn $1.55 or less, at least 6 cents below
consensus. The average of those five forecasts is only $1.44, but
one lone analyst saying $2.47 per share brought the consensus up to
$1.61.
</P>
<P>
   Look up Hutchinson Technology (HTCH), Oakwood Homes (OH), KN
Energy (KNE) and Progressive Corporation (PGR) for examples of
other companies in similar situations.
</P>
<P>
   Let's look at a company where the consensus forecast looks too
low. General Growth Properties, symbol GGP, is a real estate
investment trust specializing in shopping centers. The consensus
forecast for the September quarter is 95 cents, and the
distribution is consistent with the consensus. But look at the
fiscal year ending in December. The consensus forecast is $3.76,
however, the distribution reveals nine of the 10 analysts shown are
predicting $3.81 or more. One forecast at $2.75 is dragging the
consensus down to $3.76. General Growth Properties will report
annual earnings well above consensus forecasts if these nine
analysts are close to the mark.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies I noticed with similarly low consensus forecasts
are Lehman Brothers Holdings (LEH), Georgia-Pacific (GP) and
General Dynamics (GD).
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the distribution of earnings estimates sounds good on
paper. However, I only recently discovered this feature on Quicken,
and I have no idea how the scheme works in practice. I suggest you
put this column away for three or four months, and then see how
stocks like Pillowtex, that looked like candidates for lowered
earnings forecasts or negative surprises, performed compared to
candidates for positive surprises like General Growth Properties.
</P>
<P>
   All of the estimates quoted in this column were observed last
Tuesday. The estimates are updated weekly, so you may see different
numbers.

 SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA ECONOMY GETS HIGH MARKS
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; BY PETER SINTON &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The San Francisco Bay Area is winning big in the
new global economy, according to a report issued today (September
27) by the Bay Area Economic Forum and Bay Area Council.
</P>
<P>
   The report by McKinsey &AMP; Co. compared the nine-county Bay Area
to only seven comparable metropolitan areas _ Boston, Charlotte,
Houston, Los Angeles, New York, Phoenix and Seattle. Based on
McKinsey analysis of government and industry data and media
reports, the report found that the Bay Area has a statistical edge
in certain areas:
</P>
<P>
   --In computers, electronics and telecommunications, the area
produces from $16,000 to $52,000 more in annual revenues per
employee than second-ranked regions.
</P>
<P>
   --The Bay Area also ranks first in productivity in more
traditional areas of the economy, such as retail and wholesale
trade and &LR;   &LR; business services, and second in banking and finance
behind New York.
</P>
<P>
   --The Bay Area is second only to New York in its number of
Fortune 500 headquarters. Despite recent high-profile acquisitions,
the Bay Area has 26 Top 500 companies compared to 24 in 1995. New
York has 50.
</P>
<P>
   --The Bay Area has moved to first place in income per capita at
$38,300, compared to $35,900 in New York. In a similar study three
years ago, it trailed New York.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the good news, the Bay Area has some negatives:
</P>
<P>
   --It has the second-highest cost of living, due largely to
soaring housing prices and the high cost of labor compared to other
regions. Median prices for existing homes in the Bay Area are at
least 50 percent higher than in any of the other seven regions.
</P>
<P>
   --Traffic congestion has worsened and the Bay Area ranks second
only to Los Angeles in gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   --The Bay Area leads California in K-12 school educational
performance, but reading skills and class size are ``dismal''
compared to other cities outside the state.
</P>
<P>
   The new economic study also makes the following observations:
</P>
<P>
   --Northern California is home to more than 31 percent of the
nation's multimedia firms.
</P>
<P>
   --In 1998, 8,280 patents were issued in the Bay Area, more than
double the number issued five years earlier and more than twice as
many as in Boston, the second-ranking region.
</P>
<P>
   --Santa Clara County, the heart of Silicon Valley, has increased
employment at the rate of 23 percent a year between 1993 and 1998
and has more than 94,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   --Bay Area banking and finance employment grew 4.5 percent
annually between 1993 and 1998, but most of this growth was before
1995 &UR; . &LR;  Since then, the region has added only about 2,000 jobs, as
many banks have merged.
</P>
<P>
   --Tourism is a $5.5 billion annual business in the Bay Area.
Perhaps surprisingly, more than 55 percent of trips to the region
are business-related.
</P>
<P>
   --Retail trade in the Bay Area, including the Internet, has the
second largest number of employees after Chicago. Seventy-one
percent of them are clustered in Alameda, San Francisco, San Mateo
and Santa Clara counties.
</P>
<P>

IN A FLASH, GORDON IS GONE 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Ladies and gentlemen . . . now pitching for the Red Sox
. . . Tom Gordon!
</P>
<P>
   Never mind.
</P>
<P>
   It will go down as one of the greatest comeback moments that
never was. Red Sox closer Tom ``Flash'' Gordon, who hasn't pitched
for the team since elbow woes put him on the shelf three months
ago, raced in from the bullpen Sunday, intent on pitching the ninth
against the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   The Fenway legions roared in approval when they realized Gordon
was returning to action. It was one of the more heartfelt and
spontaneous ovations of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon got to the mound, resumed his warmup tosses, then saw
manager Jimy Williams coming out to talk with home plate umpire
Bill Welke. Williams had to inform the ump that he'd summoned a
pitcher who had not yet been activated.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Jimy first said it to the ump, I thought it was a joke,''
said Gordon. ``Then I realized, and I was like, `Wow, this is
serious.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Before you could say ``Dr. James Andrews,'' Gordon was gone. In
a Flash. As bewildered fans stood and applauded, Flash walked to
the dugout and tipped his cap. It was one of the most bizarre
non-appearances in the long history of Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear who made the mistake, but Williams took the
fall. The righty was on Williams's pregame lineup card as an extra
pitcher, but during the game, Sox officials in the press box
maintained that Gordon had not been activated. General manager Dan
Duquette called Williams in the dugout when he saw Gordon going to
the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Why didn't Williams know what Duquette knew?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' said the general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I screwed up. How's that?'' said Williams. ``I was under the
understanding that he was to be activated. I should have
double-checked, and I didn't. I'm not in this to embarrass anyone.
I came up here to the clubhouse and apologized to him. I accept the
responsibility. It's my fault for not double-checking.''
</P>
<P>
   Orioles manager Ray Miller said, ``I don't understand how it
could happen. On weekends, you just call a machine (to activate a
player). He was on my lineup card, and the ump came over and
apologized to me. I know Jimy was pretty hot about it. If he'd
pitched and I found out about it, I'd have protested.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I made the call,'' said Duquette. ``If we won the
game (the Sox lost, 8-5) and used an ineligible player, the game
would be at risk. We wanted to be in a position for the win to
stand up.''
</P>
<P>
   In the clubhouse, Red Sox players had a little fun with the
crowd of reporters around a man who did not play in the game. Bret
Saberhagen yelled to Nomar Garciaparra, ``Hey, maybe we got to make
a list _ bring in the mail, drop off the dry cleaning, activate
Flash!''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who has pitched in Trenton, Cape Fear, Fort Myers,
Augusta, and Pawtucket on his comeback trail, was not angry about
the mixup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just felt good, even though I didn't pitch,'' he said. ``I
felt good in the bullpen, and I think I sprinted to the mound
faster than normal. I'm disappointed I didn't have a chance to face
any batters, but I proved something to myself. I believe I'm ready
to pitch again. When it's time for me to pitch, I'll pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   He was touched by the reception from Red Sox Nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're unbelievable fans. I felt like I was loved. The fans
cared about me and made me feel like a part of Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Flanagan, a former Cy Young winner and now a broadcaster
with the Orioles, recalled another non-appearance appearance at
Fenway a couple of decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had Sammy Stewart and Tim Stoddard, both righties, warming
up in the bullpen, and Earl (Weaver) came out and called for the
righty. Stoddard came, and when Earl saw him he said, `I don't want
you; I want Stewart!' Stoddard told him, `That's fine, but I'm not
going back to the bullpen. I'm tired.' So he just came into the
dugout.''
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the ninth, the Orioles did it again Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came out and called for a lefty and raised my left arm,''
said Miller. ``And then here comes (righty Mike) Timlin. So I had
to yell for (Jesse) Orosco. And I was thinking, `What's going on
around here today?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette and Williams weren't sure if Flash would be activated
for Monday night's regular-season home finale against Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'd better double-check,'' said the manager.

BETTER LATE THAN NEVER FOR ORIOLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The final pitch of the game from Orioles closer Jesse
Orosco seemed to glide across home plate so smoothly, you wonder
why Troy O'Leary didn't swing hard and drive the ball to the
deepest part of Fenway Park. Instead, O'Leary, who represented the
tying run, watched helplessly as umpire Bill Welke called him out
on strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Orioles win.
</P>
<P>
   As the days of the 1999 season begin to dwindle down to a
precious few, we've seen a lot of fantastic finishes by Baltimore,
even though the team was officially eliminated from the American
League wild-card race despite an 8-5 victory over Boston Sunday
before a crowd of 32,115. The Orioles have 16 victories in their
last 18 games. But does it matter? Is the team that was picked in
many preseason polls to win the AL East prepared to look in the
mirror and say it gave all it had?
</P>
<P>
   It is.
</P>
<P>
   ``People might think we're (playing) unconscious now,'' said
Orosco, who picked up his first save despite a club-high 63
appearances. ``But we are a pretty good ballclub. It just took us
too long to get going. We got off badly out of the chute and set
ourselves way back. If we could have played .500 against teams like
Toronto (1-11) and Cleveland (1-9), we could have been in
contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've won more games this month than we did in April, May. But
things didn't work out. We're not going to make jokes out of
ourselves. We've played our hearts out to the end, and I'm glad
we're salvaging a season. I just wish it could be July or August
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   To the average fan at Fenway Park, it was a day of
disappointment as the Red Sox lost again, even though they gained
ground in terms of clinching the wild-card spot. But their
frustration is no greater than that of the Orioles. Boston closes
out the season beginning Friday at Camden Yards, while only
bragging rights are at stake for the Birds.
</P>
<P>
   But first comes a series finale Monday night against Boston ace
Pedro Martinez. Next, Baltimore makes a pit stop in New York before
heading home. There is little chance the Orioles, at 77-78, can
catch third-place Toronto (79-77). It shouldn't be like this, but
it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really been a frustrating year,'' said Orioles shortstop
Mike Bordick. ``We all thought we could play better, but
unfortunately, it's a little late. Still, we're proving to
ourselves we can play competitive baseball. The good thing about
this is that going into the offseason, we know that most of us will
be back.''
</P>
<P>
   Bordick assumes a lot. Management has yet to determine whether
the club that has gone 41-27 since the All-Star break is the team
of the future, or whether it's the club that began the year at a
36-56 clip. Nobody knows for sure. Not even manager Ray Miller,
whose head was definitely on the chopping block before the recent
surge. Miller isn't even thinking about the future. There are games
to play and races to act as spoiler in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been doing good in the second half,'' said Miller.
``We've had trouble in the bullpen, but the rest of the club has
been outstanding. The bullpen guys today weren't pretty, but they
got the job done.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what has happened to our season. But you can't make up
for anything. But I also don't think you manage or play a game
worried about the past or the future. These days, you better be
prepared to do the best you can to win because this is the big
leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their lowly finish this season, the Orioles are still a
club that can frighten you even with two starters _ Delino
DeShields and Cal Ripken _ missing with injuries. It is no fun to
face a lineup that includes Brady Anderson, Bordick, B.J. Surhoff,
Albert Belle, and Charles Johnson. Belle is particularly annoying
in that he beats your brains out and doesn't even have the decency
to smile. Of course, he only would get booed by the Fenway
Faithful, so here he isn't missing anything.
</P>
<P>
   Belle hit a two-run homer, stole a base, and made a couple of
nice catches to hurt the Red Sox Sunday. Bordick had a key double.
The Orioles overcame a decent outing by Tim Wakefield by scoring
seven unearned runs off his knuckleball. They got a well-pitched
game out of rookie Jason Johnson. That's the way the Orioles used
to beat teams. Maybe they will again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked pretty dreary at first,'' said Miller. ``But our
guys made a good adjustment (to his knuckleball), waiting longer
and not trying to charge out there too soon. Johnson pitched well.
Boston fought back. That's why they are a good club. Jesse made the
pitch when he had to. That's what we have to do to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles certainly had trouble doing that before the break.
Miller didn't hesitate to pinpoint the blame: pitching. The bullpen
had 20 of its 27 blown saves in that period. Of those failures, 12
came in the eighth and ninth innings. The Orioles have great
starting pitching in Mike Mussina, Scott Erickson, and Sidney
Ponson. Johnson might be the next star.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get the pitching straightened out,'' said Miller,
a longtime pitching guru and former Orioles pitching coach. ``I've
been here since the first day in 1997, and we haven't had a fifth
starter yet. This year we might come up with one. That should help
the bullpen. Our team ERA has dropped, but you can't change what
happened the first two months of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty good'' progress is not the Orioles' way. They have a
new catcher in Charles Johnson, fresh from the National League. He
struggled in the beginning, too. But lately he's been the backstop
we'd all heard about.
</P>
<P>
   Miller knows his players, particularly in the bullpen, must go
out and prove themselves every day. Closer Mike Timlin has
rebounded and now has 27 saves. The rest of the staff has only six.
The Orioles must do better.
</P>
<P>
   That's the Oriole way.

DAYNE, REDMAN DROPPED BALL IN HEISMAN RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The first month of the college football season is in
the books, and it's time to take stock of the race for the Heisman
Trophy to start separating the pretenders from the contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Two candidates seemed to fall out of contention for the Heisman
over the weekend when the Ron Dayne Train was derailed in
Wisconsin's 21-16 loss to Michigan, and Louisville's Chris Redman
was upstaged by Oklahoma quarterback Josh Huepel in a 42-21 loss to
the Sooners.
</P>
<P>
   Dayne, who needs 1,105 yards to break Ricky Williams's Division
1-AA rushing record, has stumbled of late, as have the No. 20
Badgers. In a 17-12 loss last week at Cincinnati, Dayne committed a
fumble as he was plowing toward the end zone for a go-ahead TD.
Saturday against the Wolverines, Dayne did a disappearing act in
the second half when the Badgers took to the air in the final 10
minutes in a desperate game of catchup.
</P>
<P>
   Dayne rushed 22 times for 88 yards, all in the first half. He
was held for no yards on eight carries in the second half, twice
failing to convert crucial first downs as the Badgers had an
eight-game home winning streak snapped.
</P>
<P>
   If the Dayne Train expects to arrive at the Downtown Athletic
Club in New York in December, he'll have to take the subway.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what impact the Wolverines had on Dayne's Heisman chances,
Michigan linebacker Ian Gold told the Detroit Free Press, ``I could
care less. Heisman, Schmeisman.''
</P>
<P>
   While Redman became the 14th passer in NCAA history to throw for
more than 10,000 career yards, pushing his total to 10,198 after
completing 24 of 49 passes for 292 yards and 2 touchdowns, Redman
was outgunned by Huepel, who threw for a school-record 429 yards
and five touchdowns to pin the tailspinning Cardinals (2-2) with
their second loss in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Six times in the first half, Louisville had chances from inside
the Oklahoma 37, but the team managed only 13 points. It wasn't
enough to sustain Redman's Heisman hopes or withstand Oklahoma's
aerial assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt good in the second half,'' said Louisville coach John
L. Smith, ``but as time went on and the more balls they threw in
the air, the worse I felt about it.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the other contenders? Florida State's Peter Warrick
bolstered his chances by helping the No. 1 Seminoles (4-0) to a
42-10 romp at North Carolina. Warrick had four catches for 103
yards and a 75-yard punt return for a touchdown that highlighted
FSU's 28-0 first quarter eruption.
</P>
<P>
   How 'bout that Drew Brees? The Purdue quarterback rallied the
No. 13 Boilermakers (4-0) to a 31-23 victory over Northwestern by
completing 32 of 50 passes for 405 yards and three TDs, including a
99-yarder to Vinny Sutherland with 6:20 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget Chad Pennington. Playing the entire game with a
painful thigh injury, the Marshall QB led the No. 22 Thundering
Herd to a 34-0 romp over hapless Temple by passing for 405 yards
and three touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Showdown Saturday was oh-so-sweet for Washington coach Rick
Neuheisel, who recorded the first win of his career as the Huskies
coach against his former Colorado team, 31-24. The pregame tension
was palpable on both sides after Colorado coach Gary Barnett and
Neuheisel had waged a bitter war of words. Barnett accused
Neuheisel of tampering when it was learned he had contacted several
Colorado players. Neuheisel, though, admitted calling his former
players to personally bid his adieu. Saturday in Seattle, Neuheisel
got the chance to do so again, hugging, greeting, and encouraging
his former players afterward. ``It was nice to at least say _
legally _ good luck to them,'' said Neuheisel, somewhat
sarcastically . . . Auburn coach Tommy Tuberville, who had gone 0-4
vs. the Tigers before leaving Mississippi to take over at Auburn
last November, was stung by his former team when Ole Miss scored a
24-17 victory in overtime, marking the Rebels' first ever win at
Jordan-Hare Stadium . . . Oregon staged a wild 33-30 victory in
triple overtime against Southern Cal that wasn't decided until
third-string kicker Josh Frankel converted a 27-yard field goal as
the game lapsed into midnight. Frankel entered in the third
overtime after starter Nathan Villegas injured his knee on a field
goal that made it 23-23 with 33 seconds left and backup Dan Katz
missed a 33-yarder that would have won it in the first OT. But that
wasn't the crazy part. That came at the end of regulation after USC
had taken a 23-20 lead, but missed the extra point. The Trojans
were hit with a 15-yard penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct when
Faaesea Mailo ripped his helmet off to celebrate Chad Morton's
1-yard run. A chip-shot PAT turned into a 35-yard attempt that went
awry when the snap sailed over the holder's head. On the ensuing
kickoff, USC pounced on an Oregon fumble and threatened to expand
its lead, but the Trojans came away empty-handed when kicker David
Newbury missed a 30-yard attempt. The Ducks then gained possession
and drove to the USC 8, where, after three unsuccessful tries at
the end zone, Villegas connected on his tying attempt that sent the
game into OT. USC lost quarterback Carson Palmer just before
halftime with a broken collarbone. He will be out a minimum of six
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So who are the winners and losers among first-year coaches after
the first month? The winners: June Jones has Hawaii at 4-0 after
the Rainbows snapped a 26-game losing streak on the road with a
20-0 victory at Southern Methodist. It also was Hawaii's first
Western Athletic Conference road victory in 15 games. And Oklahoma
coach Bob Stoops has the Sooners off to a 4-0 start, good enough
for the No. 23 spot in this week's Associated Press poll. The
losers include Lou Holtz, who has started 0-4 for the first time in
his career when South Carolina sustained a 17-10 loss to
Mississippi State. Then there is Baylor coach Kevin Steele, whose
team continues its tailspin after a season-opening 30-29 overtime
loss at Boston College. The Bears then had victory wrested away
against Nevada-Las Vegas when they lost on a freakish 100-yard
fumble recovery as time ran out. They got drilled by Oklahoma,
41-10, two weeks ago, and on Saturday they dropped to 0-4 _ marking
their worst start since 1978 _ by suffering a 62-0 thrashing
against visiting Texas. ``Some players are still thinking about
Boston College,'' said Baylor defensive back Daniel Wilturner. ``We
have to put this behind us. We have to.''

FAST START FIZZLES FOR FRAZZLED GRAHAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ They made their first scoring drive look
easy. Almost too easy. Giants quarterback Kent Graham complemented
solid running by fullback Charles Way by completing 5 of 6 passes
for 50 yards, including a 6-yard touchdown toss to wide-open
running back LeShon Johnson. Ten plays, 66 yards, 5:50 elapsed. One
frighteningly impressive showing by the Giants offense Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to mix up a few formations early on, which kept (the
Patriots) off balance, I thought,'' said Graham.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the remainder of the Giants' offensive output brings two
words to mind:
</P>
<P>
   What happened?
</P>
<P>
   Graham and company seem about as confused about that as the
Patriots were on the first drive. They did manage to move the ball,
but not for long, until late in the fourth period, when their
hurry-up offense produced a 1-yard touchdown pass from Graham to
Tiki Barber with 1:14 to go.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, New York was woeful at best. ``Maybe we need to go
to four wides and play the two-minute (offense) the whole game,''
said New York coach Jim Fassel. ``We just malfunctioned at
different times and weren't getting the chunks (of yardage) like we
did early. There's enough mistakes here or there to make a
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham completed 23 of 36 passes for 216 yards and two
touchdowns but led his team to just four passing first downs and a
36 percent third-down efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   How does a guy go from looking like John Elway on the game's
first drive to Scott Zolak the remainder of the game? Credit the
Patriots defense for keeping Graham on the run throughout and
preventing him from standing back in the pocket and looking for
receivers.
</P>
<P>
   In a running attack that mustered a total of 57 yards, Graham
was the team's No. 3 rusher, gaining 12 yards on six carries. He
would have had more than that, but he did most of his running east
to west, eluding tacklers and trying to salvage broken plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to scramble and make some plays,'' said Graham.
``They were playing man-to-man, and they have good cover guys, so I
was trying to buy some time and give our guys a chance to get open.
There were times when it worked. On the first drive, I was able to
scramble a few times and make some plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the Patriots, Graham said, made a minor adjustment, and it
paid off for New England in a major way. ``They kept playing us by
bringing some corner blitzes on us (early), and we took advantage
of it,'' he said. ``But they got away from that as the game went on
and just tried to play us even up because they were getting hurt by
the biltzes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants couldn't mount a successful running game to stretch
the Patriots defense. ``We just have to keep working at it,'' said
Graham about the Giants running game. ``It's a tough thing. It's
tough to run the ball in the National Football League, and we
understand that. We just have to keep working at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Giants will learn to execute better on short-yardage
plays. With 6:50 left in the third quarter, the Giants drove to the
Patriots 41-yard line, and on fourth and less than a yard, Graham
tried a quarterback sneak but was stopped by Tedy Bruschi and
Willie McGinest for no gain.
</P>
<P>
   But Graham begged to differ with the officials' consensus that
the Patriots had stopped him. ``I thought that was pretty
controversial there, because I thought on the second effort I was
over the line,'' said Graham.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I fell over the pile, I knew I was over the line, and I
thought I had it. The ref didn't see it that way. That will be
interesting to look at it on the tape.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants play Philadelphia next week, and between now and then
they must find a way to get their inept offense going. ``The way we
came out in the first series,'' said Graham, ``I would have thought
we would have put more points on the board.''

HOT TEMPER GETS BETTER OF BRUSCHI

<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Tedy was ready.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots and Giants were well into the fourth quarter Sunday
night, and the locals had the enemy stopped. Then they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   It was third and 10 from the New England 40, and the Patriots
were coming hard after quarterback Kent Graham. Chris Slade had him
sacked, and then things got a little crazy. The ball, which had
been blown dead anyway, was loose, and Bruschi ended up with it as
he was being tackled by guard Luke Petitgout. Then Bruschi lost it.
Just lost it.
</P>
<P>
   Bruschi, on his back, threw the ball at the Giant and ended up
with a 15-yard penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the Giants had another chance.
</P>
<P>
   Bruschi warily headed for the defensive huddle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected when I got back to the huddle to get a tongue
lashing, really, from every single one of them from Slade all the
way to Chris Carter,'' Bruschi said. ``The guys sort of looked at
me, and I called the defense for the next play, and they had the
look in their eyes like, `let's move on.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Well, they weren't exactly thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a little bit from the guys,'' Bruschi said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly it was the we've-still-got-a-job-to-do approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy to see that,'' Bruschi said. ``I was glad to see
they didn't lose their focus because of my mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   No question, he said, it was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just lost my composure,'' Bruschi said. ``That's something I
don't normally do. I pride myself on keeping my composure out
there. I thought I was tackled late, but that doesn't matter. I
just lost my composure, and luckily I dodged a bullet.''
</P>
<P>
   He and the defense stayed out and stopped the Giants again,
helped when Brad Dalusio missed a 41-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whew,'' said Bruschi, letting out a breath, when asked how it
felt to see the field goal go wide.
</P>
<P>
   The defense gave up a touchdown on New York's first and last
drives but little in between.
</P>
<P>
   Bruschi was in the spotlight several times.
</P>
<P>
   On the play just before his penalty, Graham threw the ball into
the end zone looking for former Boston College standout Pete
Mitchell. Bruschi was there, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like I was covering him all night,'' Bruschi said.
``He ran an up, ran an out and back in, and all of a sudden he was
in the end zone, and there I am with him. I saw the very familiar
big eyes. You know, he got the big eyes like the ball was coming,
and I said, `Oh, oh, here we go.' I looked back and saw the ball
and just knocked it down.''
</P>
<P>
   In the third period, trailing, 10-7, the Giants went for a first
down at the Patriot 41. On their touchdown drive in the first
period, Graham had kept for a yard on third and 1.
</P>
<P>
   From the 41, they tried the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did it once before,'' Bruschi said. ``If you let them do
it twice in a game, you're really not thinking. I figured that was
the play they were going to do and just took a shot at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Willie McGinest clogged things up down low. Bruschi and Andy
Katzenmoyer came in up high. The Patriots held, and the offense
went back the other way and pushed the score to 13-7 with an Adam
Vinatieri field goal.
</P>
<P>
   And in the end, despite the ``one glaring penalty'' that coach
Pete Carroll talked about, the Patriots and especially their
defense had done enough to win.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll, by the way, had the same read as Bruschi on the
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no excuse,'' Carroll said. ``Tedy will be the first
one to tell you he just blew it. He just lost his head, and that's
not OK. Just look at how costly it could have been. But we came
back and stopped them. That was a glaring error.''
</P>
<P>
   And one Carroll doesn't expect to see repeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a guy who understands the game as well as anybody,''
Carroll said. ``I trust him that he'll figure it out and this won't
happen again.''

GIANTS DEFENSE TAKES STRIDES IN LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Patriots were either ultra-conservative
or smart in their offensive game plan Sunday &UR;  &LR; night. They
apparently did not plan to score 50 points against the New York
Giants, who surrendered that many to Washington last week, but were
efficient enough to take command in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did the Giants anticipate allowing touchdown after
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they expected to play the team that got beat
last week,'' Giants defensive end Mike Strahan said of the Patriots
after a 16-13 loss. ``I think they did show respect for us, and we
showed respect for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they have an unstoppable offense _ I haven't
seen that yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' offense certainly seemed stoppable but performed
well enough to maintain the lead for most of the first half. But
the key was the Giants' defense, which had recovered nicely in the
last few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make the big plays defensively,'' Strahan said.
``But that will come with time. We just have to stay together.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at that last field goal they got, and if we stop
that, we'd have won by a point. You always think about things like
that. Tonight, 16 points was just too much. Next week, we could
give up 7 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came here to a hostile environment, and now we're 1-2 and
we're behind the 8-ball, so it's back to the drawing board. But
personally, I don't plan on being 1-3.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Giants missed a field goal which might have changed
the complexion of the game. And the Giants actually did succeed in
the most crucial of situations by stopping the Patriots on the
2-yard line late in the third quarter, when the game could have
turned into a New England rout. Instead, the Giants remained in
contention. On their next possession, they had a chance to cut into
a 13-7 deficit, but Brad Daluiso missed a 42-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judging by last week, the defense did pretty good,'' said
cornerback Jason Sehorn, playing his first game in more than a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Sehorn, who was injured during a special teams incident during
the 1998 exhibition season, was below full strength. But Sehorn
also earned the respect of the Patriots, judging by the short
patterns receivers ran against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have to remember what a quick slant is,'' Sehorn said.
``I wasn't worried about the deep stuff because that is just
athletic ability. I just wanted to take away the `go' route. They
could have the 8-yarders but not the 80-yarders. If they were going
to beat me, they were going to have to dink it down the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Sehorn, though, appears prepared to become a factor, possibly
the ``big play'' ingredient the Giants have been lacking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just happy to be playing a game,'' Sehorn said. ``After
a year and a half off, it was nice. But there were a lot of moments
that let me know I'm not quite where I want to be. In the fourth
quarter, they started to run slants on me. But the game went pretty
much like I thought it would.''

PATRIOTS NOT IMPRESSED WITH THEMSELVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Undefeated and unimpressed. That's what your
New England Patriots are this morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're winning, but it's not to our liking,'' safety Lawyer
Milloy said late Sunday night after his team had moved to 3-0 with
a tight, 16-14 victory over the New York Giants that was
highlighted this time by withering defense rather than overheated
offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to be 3-0 but the way we're playing we're not even
good yet. We want to dominate. We haven't dominated anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Milloy is right about that. They have yet to dominate anybody,
but then again they have yet to lose to anybody either and in the
NFL that is what counts. Pro football is a bottom-line business.
It's about winning above all else and so far, above all else, the
Patriots have found ways to win.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday &UR;  &LR; night they did it with just enough Drew Bledsoe (20 of
28 for 233 yards) and Terry Glenn (five catches for 95 yards,
including a 45-yard deep slant that helped break the game open) and
more than enough defense to stuff the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Milloy and Co. allowed New York to march 66 yards on its opening
drive to take a 7-0 lead, but that was in large part because the
Giants' hurry-up offense led to the defensive calls coming in late
and causing New England some confusion. Once that was solved, the
defense shut down the Giants until their second scoring drive, a
stretch of 46 minutes and 58 seconds during which New York was
forced to punt five straight times, was stopped on downs once, and
then missed a field goal before scoring a touchdown with 1:14 to
play that was meaningless to everyone but the gamblers in the crowd
who took the points and the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Sandwiched between those two scores was just enough offense to
carry the day and more than enough defense to keep things under
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to be 3-0,'' Bledsoe said. ``We had to do it in
somewhat dramatic fashion but to be 3-0 at this point is a good
feeling. At the same time, it's only three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could make it easier on ourselves (in the future). We can
play better. We realize that.''
</P>
<P>
   For as long as they do realize that, these Patriots will be very
dangerous to everyone they play. The moment they forget is when the
trouble will begin.
</P>
<P>
   That has been the pattern the past two years. Fast start. Stall
out. Desperation sprint to the finish line to get into the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   It is a pattern Milloy was thinking about Sunday &UR;  &LR; night as he
contemplated his team's third straight fast start under Pete
Carroll, a start this year in which they have won by margins of 2
points, 3 points, and 2 points, which means they're not winning by
much but they're winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our adversity the last two years prepared us,'' Milloy said.
``It's a long season. We've always been strong at the start. But we
saw what can happen in the fourth or fifth or sixth week when
people start to get hurt. We know how good we can be at the end if
we stay healthy but we're a long way from the end.''
</P>
<P>
   They are, but they're close to being 4-0 for the second time in
three years because Sunday they play the Browns in Cleveland and
frankly, if the plane lands safely, that should be about all it
takes to ensure they will be undefeated when they head for Kansas
City to open the second quarter of their season. But if they are
still unblemished then, it seems they will go there with a far
different attitude than the last two years. An attitude that both
recognizes what they have done thus far (which is nothing
significant) and what they are capable of doing (which is something
very significant).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really important to us to realize we're 3-0 and to
evaluate very clearly and be very truthful about it,'' Carroll
said. ``We all know we have better football ahead of us. We've won
ugly. We've won sloppy. Winning is what it's about but we got to
get better.''
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to be better than 3-0 when you've only played
three games but it bodes well for the future that this edition of
the New England Patriots seems to realize it's possible to be
better.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, to get where they want to go in January, it also will
be necessary.

PATRIOTS PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Patriots are 3-0 and the Jets are 0-3.
Who would have thought it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I did,'' said New England receiver Shawn Jefferson. ``I knew
we were capable of 3-0; I don't know about their team. That's not
my concern, but we have so much talent in here that I knew we could
beat these teams. Tonight we won the game a different way. We knew
they would be tough, but we just took what the defense gave us.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Giants defense didn't give too much. Not nearly as much
as it gave the Washington offense last week when it allowed 50
points, but enough for the Patriots to take a 16-14 win before
59,169 Sunday &UR;  &LR; night at Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots lead the Miami Dolphins, who were off this week and
are 2-0, by a half-game in the AFC East. The Bills and the Colts
are 2-1 and the Patriots have a chance to go 4-0 for the second
time in the last three years when they visit expansion Cleveland
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew they were going to play us tough and that we couldn't
hang a big number on them,'' said quarterback Drew Bledsoe, who
went 20 of 28 for 233 yards with no touchdowns. ``We're fortunate
that we don't play in the same division as the Giants because
they're a tough team. We've had to fight right down to the end
(against) all of these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   But while there was a sense of happiness in the Patriots' locker
room, there also was a dose of reality. The Patriots still have
room to improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can make things easier on ourselves and we know that,''
said Bledsoe. ``In order to get to where we want to be we have to
play closer to our potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive coordinator Steve Sidwell also left the locker room
feeling unsatisfied, even though the Patriots allowed a
first-quarter touchdown to the Giants and not another until the
final 1:14 of the game when Kent Graham hit Tiki Barber on a 1-yard
pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were fortunate to come away with the win,'' said Sidwell.
``We can say what we want, but right now we're not playing a
high-quality brand of defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again the game came down to Adam Vinatieri, whose third
field goal of the night, from 41 yards with 3:12 remaining, sealed
the win. Well, almost. Playing a softer defense, the Patriots
allowed the Giants to drive 70 yards to make it interesting at
16-14.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Coates recovered the ensuing onside kick and the Patriots
let the clock run out.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots had to come from behind again, as they had the
first two weeks, but this time only from a 7-0 deficit after the
Giants' first possession of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for the Patriots is that they reduced their
penalty total from last week's 15 to three, though an
unsportsmanlike penalty for taunting by Tedy Bruschi nearly killed
the Patriots in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Bruschi had broken up a Graham-to-Pete Mitchell toss in the end
zone when he got a hand on the ball at the last moment. Then his
temper got the best of him. After being in on a sack of Graham on a
third-and-10 at the Patriots 40, the ball came loose from Graham
after the play was dead. Bruschi came up with the ball and guard
Luke Pettigout then pounced on Bruschi, who threw the ball at
Pettigout.
</P>
<P>
   But the Patriots escaped when Brad Daluiso missed a 41-yard
field goal attempt wide left when a high snap gave Troy Brown time
to disrupt the kick.
</P>
<P>
   Bruschi breathed a sigh of relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had dodged a bullet,'' Bruschi said. ``I'll never do
that again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you have to win games like this,'' said offensive
lineman Bruce Armstrong. ``We thought coming in it might be a trap
game, but somehow we got it done. I think we could have scored more
points, but it's another game off the schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their conservative game plan, the Patriots didn't run
the ball very well as the Giants held Terry Allen to 50 yards on 20
carries.
</P>
<P>
   The patient Patriots took control of the ball at the 32 late in
the fourth and ate the clock. With 3:17 left, Lamont Warren was
stopped for no gain, setting up the clinching field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Following a 7-7 deadlock at the half, the Patriots made
adjustments and shut down the Giants. They got the ball back,
drove, and Vinatieri kicked a 38-yard field goal to give the
Patriots a 10-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   New England's defense had its finest moment on the Giants'
second possession, after Barber's 36-yard return to midfield. The
Giants faced a fourth and 1 when the middle of the Patriots' line,
led by Henry Thomas, along with Bruschi, stopped Graham on a run.
The Patriots took over on downs on their 41.
</P>
<P>
   New England put together another patient drive to boost its lead
to 13-7. Bledsoe hit Terry Glenn (five catches for 95 yards) on a
slant for 16 yards and a nifty run by fullback Tony Carter produced
9 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe found Coates with a 10-yard pass and he dragged a few
bodies an extra 4 yards to the 20. Bledsoe then found Brown for 11
yards to the 8. On third and 1, Bledsoe dropped back and appeared
to be going to either Carter or Coates, but Carter fell down and
the pass to Coates, who was being mauled, was out of reach. They
settled for a 19-yard field goal by Vinatieri.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants drove 66 yards in 10 plays on their first possession
of the game. Like the Jets and Colts, the Giants went right after
Ty Law. Graham hit Ike Hilliard for 27 yards to the Patriots 30.
Five plays later, Graham again found Hilliard over Law for 8 yards
on a second and 9 to the Patriots 10, and three plays later Graham
tossed to a wide open LeShon Johnson on the left side for a 6-yard
touchdown with 7:48 remaining in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until its fourth possession, early in the second
quarter, that the Patriots offense started to click. And it did so
in a big way. Bledsoe went up top to Glenn, who beat Phillippi
Sparks on a post to the middle of the field and made a beautiful
leaping grab at the 2. Two plays later, Allen busted through the
line from the 1 for the score.

CALL AT QB: IT'S BLEDSOE OVER GRAHAM 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ This game was a perfect illustration of the
National Football League heading into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   The team with the better quarterback wins.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be the team with the best defense won.
</P>
<P>
   But not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Giants had the better defensive team Sunday night
at Foxboro Stadium, but went home on the short end of a 16-14 score
because the Patriots had Drew Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe vs. Kent Graham. The Patriots fans will take that every
time.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants came in here near the bottom of the league in
offense. In their first drive of the night, which put them ahead,
7-0, they lost their top runner, Sean Bennett, to a knee injury.
They already had lost Gary Brown, who had been their top back, to a
knee injury in preseason. Without them, the Giants didn't have
enough speed in the running game for it to be a concern of the
Patriots, who could concentrate on stopping a Giants pass offense
that is just average.
</P>
<P>
   Neither team could run the ball, both averaging 2 yards per
carry.
</P>
<P>
   This put the game squarely in the hands of the quarterbacks.
Bledsoe had the tougher assignment. Even though the Giants gave up
50 points last week to the Redskins, they are a good defensive team
with a solid game plan.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive coordinator John Fox had the New York defensive backs
jamming the New England receivers as they started into their
passing routes, throwing the timing that is so critical to the
Patriots' offense out of whack.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe was more hesitant than he has been all year, but once he
figured it out, he started to hurt the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   He played well in the first half, completing 10 of 15 passes and
setting up the only New England touchdown with a well-executed
45-yard bomb to Terry Glenn that carried to the Giants 2-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   On the play, Glenn was set to the right, with Shawn Jefferson in
the slot. Jefferson ran a slant into the middle of the field, tying
up safety Sam Garnes. Meanwhile, Glenn ran right at cornerback
Phillippi Sparks, backing him up, then suddenly making a quick move
to the middle of the field, which was wide open. This was a
first-down pass and Bledsoe enjoyed his greatest success in
first-down situations, when the Giants were looking run.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe controlled the game in the second half. He marched his
team into Giants territory three straight times. They couldn't get
the TDs, but settled for three field goals, which were the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Armstead played a super game for the Giants, collecting 11
tackles, several behind the line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   But the Giants offense couldn't make the big play.
</P>
<P>
   Graham opened well, connecting on all five of his passes in the
first drive that ended with a touchdown and a 7-0 Giant lead.
</P>
<P>
   New York wouldn't score again for another 52 minutes when they
got another touchdown in the final two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Graham had 136 of his 201 yards passing in these two drives,
which means that in between he threw for just 65 yards. In the
third period, the Giants had just 16 yards total offense.
</P>
<P>
   Graham is mobile, but erratic. Time and again he would move
around the pocket, making room for himself to either run or throw.
Meanwhile, receivers often were getting open, but by the time he
set himself to deliver the ball, those openings were gone.
</P>
<P>
   The most critical play came in the opening minutes of the fourth
quarter. The Patriots were nursing a 13-7 lead, but the Giants had
the ball on the New England 40, second and 10.
</P>
<P>
   Graham went back to pass and scrambled to his right. The entire
right side of the field was open. He could have walked it 30 yards
deep into Patriots territory. Meanwhile, tight end Pete Mitchell
had gotten wide open behind Tedy Bruschi at the goalline. Graham
threw the ball too late, allowing Bruschi to recover and tip the
ball away. If the ball was delivered on time, it was a touchdown
and a New York lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have won three games, by 2, 3, and 2 points. Next
stop is Cleveland, where they should go 4-0 against a hapless
Browns team. One of their toughest tests of the season follows, at
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, all the Patriots have is a passing game. They can't
run the ball, and they can't get a pass rush without blitzing and
leaving themselves vulnerable in the secondary.
</P>
<P>
   The trifecta of Bledsoe, Glenn, and Ben Coates is the best in
the league. Glenn had five catches for 95 yards. Coates had several
in clutch situations. But they'll need help from others as they get
into the heart of their schedule.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; THE STORY OF AMERICAN FREEDOM &LR;  By Eric Foner. Norton, $15.95. A
historian argues that freedom is not a fixed set of principles but
a ``complex of values'' that have evolved over time as various
excluded groups have struggled for liberty. ``The book's strongest
claim to distinction lies ... in its succinct, information-packed,
wonderfully readable account of the twists and turns in
20th-century American history,'' Pauline Maier wrote in The New
York Times Book Review in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE POISONWOOD BIBLE &LR;  By Barbara Kingsolver. Harper Perennial,
$14. The story of a fanatical Baptist clergyman who uproots his
Georgia family and sets them down in the Belgian Congo in 1959 is
narrated by his wife and four daughters, each of whom abandons one
faith and discovers another as their lives unravel in the jungle.
This novel, selected as one of the best books of 1998 by the
editors of The New York Times Book Review, also has much to say
about America and its homegrown brand of missionary zeal. ``For all
its portraiture of place'' the narrative is ``shaped by keen-eyed
women contemplating themselves and one another and a village whose
familiarity it takes a tragedy to discover,'' Verlyn Klinkenborg
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CINDERELLA &AMP; COMPANY: Backstage at the Opera With Cecilia
Bartoli &LR;  By Manuela Hoelterhoff. Vintage, $14. This profile of the
Italian mezzo-soprano Cecilia Bartoli is also a withering look at
modern opera: the industry's youth-obsessed star-making machinery,
the intense egomania and raging insecurities, the brutal sniping.
The result ``is a naughtily witty tell-almost-all book,'' Terry
Teachout wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OPERA, OR THE UNDOING OF WOMEN &LR; , by Catherine Clement
(University of Minnesota, $17.95), is a scholarly critique by a
European feminist who argues that opera is one long tale of male
domination in which victimized women characters are consigned to a
``sung death.'' In 1989 the reviewer Paul Robinson called this ``a
highly original interpretation.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE VOYAGE OF THE NARWHAL &LR;  By Andrea Barrett. Norton, $14. A
British naturalist embarks on a voyage of self-discovery when he
boards a vessel searching for clues to the mysterious disappearance
of Sir John Franklin's Arctic expedition of 1845. Last year the
reviewer Annette Kobak called this novel a ``marvelous
achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TOO COOL &LR;  By Duff Brenna. Plume, $12.95. In this raw novel
about teen-age desperadoes in Colorado, a 16-year-old misfit named
Triple E escapes from reform school and gets stranded with his
girlfriend in a heavy snowstorm. The result is ``an unfaltering,
unflinching, piercing look into a tormented youthful heart,''
Richard Bernstein wrote in 1998 in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE NURTURE ASSUMPTION: Why Children Turn Out the Way They Do &LR; 
By Judith Rich Harris. Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $15. Melding
research from many fields, a former writer of textbooks on
developmental psychology makes the provocative case that children
are shaped more by their own temperament and peers than by the
input of their parents. No matter which side of the argument
readers come down on, ``Harris writes beautifully, in a tone both
persuasive and conversational,'' Carol Tavris wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE LUNCH-BOX CHRONICLES: Notes From the Parenting
Underground &LR; , by Marion Winik (Vintage, $12), is a frontline report
on child rearing by a commentator for National Public Radio. ``Take
Erma Bombeck, add the obsessions of a single mother ... and you
have Marion Winik, as companionable a writer as a crazed parent
ever found,'' Andrea Cooper wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MALINA &LR;  By Ingeborg Bachmann. Holmes &AMP; Meier, $15.95. A
Viennese woman plagued by violent dreams navigates difficult
relationships with two men, one of whom forces her to confront the
pain of her childhood. ``This courageous and important novel,''
originally published in German in 1971, ``is equal to the best of
Virginia Woolf and Samuel Beckett,'' Peter Filkins wrote in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MY YEAR OFF &LR;  By Robert McCrum. Broadway, $13. The author was 42
and the editor in chief of a major London publishing house when he
suffered a paralyzing stroke. This ``lucid, heartfelt'' account of
his arduous recovery ``is a testament to the parallel trials and
the courage of the family members of stroke victims,'' Abraham
Verghese wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MACKEREL BY MOONLIGHT &LR;  By William F. Weld. Pocket Star, $6.99.
This mystery novel by the former Massachusetts governor is about an
assistant U.S. attorney from Brooklyn whose shadowy past resurfaces
after he opts for a job in a white-shoe Boston law firm and a life
in politics. Last year the reviewer Donald E. Westlake admired the
``deft and devious story-telling.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THIRST &LR;  By Ken Kalfus. Washington Square/Pocket Books, $12.95.
Many of these stories are brief and jarring fantasies, including
one in which Marco Polo describes a series of indoor retail malls
to the emperor Kublai Khan. ``The displaced figures in `Thirst'
drift through worlds that are at once astonishing and familiar,''
Ron Carlson wrote last year.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Sept. 26, moved Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-TERRORISM-REVIEW (Moscow) _ It would be easy to say that
it is Russia's turn for an Islamic extremist problem. This month's
bloody invasion of Dagestan by Islamic guerrillas and the
subsequent bombings of Russian apartment houses, now widely
ascribed to them, seems most of all the harvest of a Russian-sown
whirlwind. By Michael Wines.
</P>
<P>
   (Will move in the ``i'' category)
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-FATIGUE-REVIEW (Washington) _ Clinton fatigue is
essentially a catch-all to describe a general sense that people
have had enough of Bill Clinton. It was bound to happen. With the
explosion of 24-hour news on television and the Internet, Clinton
has been more in the face of Americans than any of his
predecessors. The Clintons, still craving the spotlight, do not
seem to have learned the oldest trick in show business: Always
leave them wanting more. By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   (Will move in the ``a'' category)
</P>
<P>
   Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   TOBACCO-SUITS-REVIEW (Washington) _ Lawyers at the Justice
Department, at the same time they were trumpeting a sweeping civil
lawsuit last week against the tobacco industry, mentioned almost as
an afterthought that their criminal inquiry was dead. Officials
never provided the precise reasons for dropping the investigation.
By Marc Lacey.
</P>
<P>
   SCHOOL-BUSING-REVIEW (Undated) _ The traditional enemies of
busing to achieve school integration were once easy to spot: angry
white parents glaring at little black boys and girls stepping off
the bus at a new school. But as desegregation plans have fallen by
the wayside in so many schools districts it is not whites alone who
have favored its demise. By Dirk Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   LONGEVITY-TACTICS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Is there anything you can
eat that might make you live a lot longer? The answer is yes, but
it's not entirely pleasant. By Nicholas Wade. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ORWELL-COMMUNISM-REVIEW (Undated) _ ``Animal Farm,'' the famous
1945 fable is, of course, George Orwell's take on what he called
``the Soviet myth'' of the Bolshevik Revolution and its corruption
of the ideal of Communism, but his other writings as a whole are
less tough on Napoleon/Stalin than on left-wing Western apologists
for the dictator and his regime. By Walter Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   REPUBLICANS-CAMPAIGN-REVIEW (Washington) _ The way Republicans
were acting last week it was almost as if some of them could not
decide which was more uncomfortable: having Pat Buchanan leave the
party or John McCain stay in it. By Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   BILLIONAIRE-CHILDSUPPORT-REVIEW (New York) _ To the delight of
New Yorkers disgusted by the spectacle and to the dismay of New
Yorkers dazzled by tales of fairy-tale opulence, the child support
battle between Patricia Duff, a multi-millionaire Democratic
fund-raiser, and her ex-husband, the billionaire Revlon chairman
Ronald O. Perelman, concluded last week. Now a judge who brings bag
lunches to court will decide whether to grant Ms. Duff's request
for $1.6 million a year in child support. By David Rohde. (With
graphic)
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   AUSTRALIA-ASIA-REVIEW (Sydney, Australia) _ For more than two
decades, Australia has been trying to promote itself as part of
Asia. Now, in East Timor, it has found out how unnerving that
concept can be when put to the test. By Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY-DEMOCRACY-REVIEW (Istanbul, Turkey) _ When Prime Minister
Bulent Ecevit of Turkey meets with President Clinton and
congressional leaders in Washington this week, there will be much
talk about earthquake relief, geopolitics, and obscure though
important matters like trade arbitration and oil pipeline routes.
But on Capitol Hill and elsewhere in the United States, those
matters pale into insignificance. There the great question is at
once simpler and more complex: How democratic is Turkey? By Stephen
Kinzer.

   A POWERFUL EARTHQUAKE DEVASTATES TAIWAN
</P>
<P>
   An earthquake registering 7.6 on the standard seismic scale left
more than 2,000 people dead, thousands more hurt, and more than
100,000 homeless in Taiwan. Days later, amid strong aftershocks and
lingering power outages, rescuers continued to search for survivors
trapped in the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Hit hardest were the central and northern regions of the island,
where high-rise buildings collapsed and roads and bridges crumpled.
</P>
<P>
   With many businesses shut and semiconductor production
disrupted, economists were predicting a slowdown in the island's
economic performance as well.

   A CALL TO ARMS FOR HUMAN RIGHTS

   Secretary-General Kofi Annan broke with a tradition of merely
summing up a year's work of the United Nations when he opened the
General Assembly debate and called in unambiguous terms for the
right of the organization to intervene anywhere when civilians are
put in mortal danger by their own governments or by civil wars. His
message: Leaders can no longer hide behind borders, using national
sovereignty as a shield against the world. France's foreign
minister, Hubert Vedrine, spoke for many leaders gathered at the
United Nations when he said that Annan had opened a profound debate
that will go on for years, and one that creates a new philosophical
divide between the developed nations and the third world.

   AN EMOTIONAL VISIT TO BERLIN BY BARAK
</P>
<P>
   Germany may be ready to call itself a ``great power'' again, as
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder did recently, but it still worries
more than any other nation about its image. So the fact that the
first state visitor to Berlin since the German government moved
there last month was Ehud Barak, the Israeli prime minister, had
great symbolic importance. The visit gave Schroeder the occasion to
say that there could be no end to the process of remembering Nazi
crimes, as he stood with Barak at the former Sachsenhausen
concentration camp near Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli prime minister warned of the danger of neo-Nazism
but said he had ``no reservations'' about the move to Berlin and
was confident about Germany's democratic institutions. That was
precisely the message Germany wanted as its government starts work
in Berlin 54 years after the collapse of Hitler's Reich.

   AN ART WAR IN NEW YORK

<P>
   Rudolph W. Giuliani drew a new line in New York's mayoral sand.
Fresh from his battles to tame New York's pedestrians, drivers who
cause gridlock and mosquitoes, he waded into the slippery waters of
artistic expression, vowing to cut city subsidies to the Brooklyn
Museum of Art if it doesn't cancel a ``sick'' exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   The museum acknowledged that the show _ including a Virgin Mary
adorned with elephant dung _ is strong stuff, warning in promotions
that it ``may cause shock, vomiting, confusion, panic, euphoria and
anxiety.'' But mayoral intrusion, the lawyer Floyd Abrams warned,
``is at war with the First Amendment.''

<P>
   ``They made a wonderful, swift decision on this,'' Werner
Gundersheimer, the president of the National Humanities Alliance,
said after the White House decided to turn down an invitation for
the president of the United States to pose as a scholar.
</P>
<P>
   The invitation had come from the National Endowment for the
Humanities, asking President Clinton to deliver the annual
Jefferson Lecture. For 27 years, it had been given by one of the
nation's leading scholars.
</P>
<P>
   The scholarly community reacted with dismay at the thought of
introducing politics into what has always been an intellectual
event. Objections were raised by both Clinton's supporters and his
antagonists.
</P>
<P>
   One antagonist, William J. Bennett, who headed the endowment
under the Republicans, said, ``Sense prevailed,'' and added: ``This
is about scholarship. The president, whatever he is, is not a
scholar. I don't think that even he thinks he is.''

   A STORM'S HARSH AFTERMATH

<P>
   Floyd, the monster hurricane that started rolling up the
Atlantic Coast two weeks ago, lived up to its billing in pummeling
shoreline homes, harbors and boats. Chickens and pigs too, posing
an unanticipated kind of health hazard.
</P>
<P>
   The storm's wake of rising, rain and tide-bloated rivers left
much of eastern North Carolina's vast farming country flooded,
along with parts of New Jersey, New York, Florida and Virginia. By
the weekend, it had been blamed for more than 60 deaths, more than
40 of them in hardest-hit North Carolina. Water, a greater evil in
this storm than wind, also posed an environmental and public health
disaster of leaking industrial chemicals and animal wastes.
Officials said the storm had drowned 1 million chickens and turkeys
and 110,000 hogs.

   As Serbs began a faltering new round of demonstrations to oust
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, the Kosovo Liberation Army
agreed, in extended negotiations that involved concessions by NATO,
to ``transform'' itself into a smaller, civilian Kosovo Protection
Corps. But the group, with new insignia, retains rights to bear
some sidearms, has access to helicopters and keeps the structure of
a paramilitary force. Serbian opposition leaders believe that
NATO's inability to protect Serbs in Kosovo has helped Milosevic
consolidate his political position in Serbia.

   John Paul Jones famously declared ``I have not yet begun to
fight'' but last week Grove/Atlantic gave up the ship, killing a
disputed new biography of the American naval hero amid allegations
of copyright piracy. The book, which had taken the hero's most
famous line as its title, was by James Mackay, a prolific Scottish
author of some 160 titles. But it was termed ``a spectacular and
sustained act of plagiarism'' by a Columbia University history
professor, David Armitage, who found that it mirrored a 1959 Jones
biography by the late naval historian Samuel Eliot Morison. The
inquiry was undertaken after The New York Times raised questions
about close similarities. It was not a new issue for Mackay, who
has already been attacked for plagiarizing biographies of Alexander
Graham Bell, Mary Queen of Scots, Andrew Carnegie and Sir William
Wallace, the 13th century warrior celebrated as ``Braveheart.''
Before his phone line in Glasgow went dead last week, Mackay denied
any copying. ``There are only a certain number of words in the
English language,'' he said.

<P>
   It would be easy, and to some tempting, to say that it is
Russia's turn _ that after years of Soviet gloating over Islam's
attacks on the West, that after the KGB's goading of proxies like
the East Germans to arm Middle Eastern terrorists, that after the
brutal destruction of Chechnya in the civil war three years ago, it
is well past time that Russia had her own Islamic extremist
problem.
</P>
<P>
   It also might be true. This month's bloody invasion of Dagestan
by Islamic guerrillas and the subsequent bombings of Russian
apartment houses, now widely ascribed to them, seem most of all the
harvest of a Russian-sown whirlwind.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, though, is that the latest uprising in Russia's
Caucasus is not merely the Kremlin's problem _ not any more than
the collapse of Lebanon was just an Israeli migraine. Lebanon was a
geopolitical running sore, an imploded state that threatened for
years to destabilize even prosperous and militarily robust nations
like Israel, whose problems would then ripple out to the wider
world as well.
</P>
<P>
   Envision Dagestan's bad neighbor Chechnya, from whence the
guerrillas sprang, as the Lebanon of the Caucasus: another imploded
state, its government a husk, its real rulers Islamic militias
intent on expanding their political and religious influence. Then
substitute Russia for Israel, and the potential for trouble is
clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the goal of the operation was the occupation of
Dagestan,'' Alexander Iskandaryan, director of Moscow's Center for
Caucasian Studies, said in an interview. ``It seems to me that the
goal is the destabilization of Dagestan _ and, perhaps, of Russia
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The parallels between Chechnya and Lebanon, Russia and Israel
are, of course, anything but exact. The Chechen militias that
invaded Dagestan almost certainly are backed by radical
fundamentalists in places like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan _ the
Saudi-born terrorist Osama bin Laden, Russia charges, or wealthy
troublemakers like him. But unlike the situation in Lebanon, where
the militias often acted as proxies for various Middle East allies,
including Iran and Syria and Israel itself, the evidence that
foreign governments are feeding the Chechen-led insurrection is so
far slight.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is Russia Israel. Russia is not encircled by enemies devoted
to its destruction, and the notion that a few thousand rebels could
overwhelm an 11-time-zone colossus is ludicrous.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, they might not need to. Russia today, like
Israel 20 years ago, is divided and deeply uncertain about the
future, if for different reasons. Israel's biggest worries then
were external, while Russia's today are of its own making: domestic
havoc has stripped people of the sense that their economy, their
politicians, their law and order _ even their territory _ are under
control.
</P>
<P>
   So impotence in the Caucasus can be just as unnerving to
Russians, or even more so, as was frustration in Beirut to
Israelis. And Russia clearly has been unnerved.
</P>
<P>
   Military leaders have responded to the Chechen insurrection in
outsized fashion, by pouring thousands of troops into Dagestan and
ordering that a deep trench be dug along the Chechen border _ a
Berlin Wall, of sorts, but intended to keep people out rather than
in. On Thursday and again on Friday, Russian jets bombed the
Chechen capital of Grozny, destroying petroleum terminals and radar
installations that Russian strategists said aided rebel forces.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the week, a deputy chief of the general staff assured
citizens that the Kremlin had learned the bitter lessons of its
defeat in the Chechen civil war and had no plans to repeat it. But
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, in Kazakhstan, swore to ``pursue the
terrorists everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You will forgive me,'' Putin said, invoking an old military
saying, ``but if we catch them in the toilet, we will rub them out
in the outhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as they go, analysts here say, such threats are not
entirely unjustified: The rebel invasion seems mostly unprovoked.
The trouble is that military action alone is a prescription for
further instability, and Moscow so far has no other notion of how
to cope with an internal insurrection.
</P>
<P>
   Russia lost Chechnya _ permanently, it seems _ by dint of force.
Russians subjugated the region in the 19th century, and Stalin
ensured lasting hatred by forcibly marching virtually the entire
population of Chechnya to Kazakhstan in a failed attempt to forever
Russify the area.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its shared border, Dagestan is not another Chechnya _
not yet. Its residents mostly practice a more traditional form of
Islam and see themselves as part of the Russian Federation. Indeed,
Moscow responded to the Chechen incursion by handing out rifles to
Dagestan's young men.
</P>
<P>
   But in other ways, Dagestan is ripe for infection with the
Chechen virus.
</P>
<P>
   Its economy has been ravaged by Russia's depression and
Chechnya's civil war, and the majority of people are unemployed and
uneducated. The birth rate is high and the youth, idle and
rootless, are prime targets for the strict anti-establishment
tenets of the Chechen fundamentalists.
</P>
<P>
   The Dagestan government, a rickety alliance of nearly 40 ethnic
leaders, is rotted by corruption. And economic dislocation has
pushed ethnic groups into each others' territories.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Moscow's politicians have shown neither the inclination
nor the financial means to bring about the economic and educational
improvements that might prevent radicalism from taking root. Air
strikes and troops have kept the rebels out, but only at the cost
of destroying towns along the Chechen border and creating still
more poverty.
</P>
<P>
   And that is a dangerous prescription, because for Moscow, the
stakes are much higher than mere control of chunks of territory in
regions much of the rest of the world has never heard of. The
Caucasus is Russia's geographic buffer against Iranian
fundamentalism and its principal window on the Black and Caspian
Seas, with their oil and access to the Mediterranean. But it is
also more.
</P>
<P>
   It is the Caucasus through which Russia has sought to project
power for the last 150 years. Its loss would sap the steadily
draining reservoir of national will, with unpredictable political
consequences.

Seas, with their oil and access to the Mediterranean. But it is
also more.
</P>
<P>
   It is the Caucasus through which Russia has sought to project
power for the last 150 years. Its loss would sap the steadily
draining reservoir of national will, with unpredictable political
consequences.

   Washington _ President Clinton made an extraordinary confession
at an intimate dinner with a handful of his biggest fund-raisers at
the Hay Adams Hotel across from the White House last week: The
American people are tired of him and of his administration.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding more like an outsider seeking the White House than a
fixture there for seven years, Clinton asked rhetorically: ``Do we
need a change? The answer is, yes we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was making a case for the elevation of his vice
president, Al Gore. But in doing so, he broached a notion
articulated mostly by Republicans, but also by Democrats, that a
``Clinton fatigue'' has infected U.S. politics. And while Clinton
did not use the phrase itself, he might as well have when he
explained the ``great challenge'' for Gore: ``People think at
election time they're supposed to vote for change.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton fatigue is essentially a catch-all to describe a general
sense that people have had enough of Bill Clinton. It was bound to
happen. He has pulled the public through an excruciating journey of
scandals. The most distasteful was the Monica Lewinsky matter, of
course, but new ones seem to keep cropping up all the time: The
fracas over Puerto Rican terrorists one day, the Russian
money-laundering imbroglio the next.
</P>
<P>
   With the explosion of 24-hour news on television and the
Internet, Clinton has been more in the face of Americans than any
of his predecessors. The Clintons, still craving the spotlight, do
not seem to have learned the oldest trick in show business: Always
leave them wanting more. Hillary Rodham Clinton's expected run for
Senate from New York will keep the Clinton act on stage even
longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The history of this century shows this is really a unique
phenomenon,'' said Michael Beschloss, the presidential historian.
``You have both the disquietude of the president in office plus the
added element of him having been there all those years.'' He
contended that while people would be uneasy about a third Clinton
term, if he were allowed to run again, they would not have had such
qualms with other two-term presidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no Eisenhower fatigue in 1960,'' Beschloss said.
``He would have been elected to a third term by a huge landslide.''
Ronald Reagan might have been elected to a third term as well; many
Republicans said they viewed President George Bush's tenure as the
third term of the Reagan administration. Other modern presidents
were not as popular, perhaps not so much because of general fatigue
but because of catastrophic events that undermined their
presidencies. President Lyndon B. Johnson, unable to climb out of
the Vietnam War, did not dare seek re-election. President Richard
M. Nixon did, but was soon forced from office by Watergate. Jimmy
Carter was the beneficiary of Watergate fatigue, but could not
survive the malaise of a foul economy and the Iranian hostage
crisis when the sunnier Reagan came along.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are delighting in their diagnosis of Clinton
fatigue. Sen. Sam Brownback of Kansas said former Sen. Bill Bradley
has crept up on Gore in polls in some states because ``he doesn't
have the baggage of the Clinton presidency around his neck.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the ferment about fatigue may be overblown, stirred up by a
restless press and pundits longing to begin the millennium with a
fresh presidential story line instead of what has seemed the
inevitable faceoff between Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
In addition, critics of Clinton and Gore may find it easy to lump
the administration's troubles under the ``fatigue'' umbrella _ and
try to drag Gore down with them.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Fred Steeper, the pollster for Bush, the
Republican front-runner, said: ``Fatigue is too weak a concept to
fit the public attitudes about the White House. I call it Clinton
disgust.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every voter may be so disgusted. Polls show evidence of a
Clinton fatigue, but one that is not particularly potent. Clinton's
robust job approval ratings have barely budged.
</P>
<P>
   And it is not entirely clear that Clinton fatigue is ailing
Gore. In a Washington Post/ABC News Poll this month, 53 percent of
respondents said they were ``plain tired'' of Clinton, but 45
percent disagreed with that statement. Respondents were evenly
split over whether Gore was too close to the president ``to provide
the fresh start the country needs.''

</P>
<P>
   The truth is, Gore may not be electrifying Democrats for reasons
that have nothing to do with Clinton. It has always been a struggle
for anyone in a president's shadow to develop a distinct persona
early in a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And, as Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York said in his
endorsement of Bradley last week, ``We'd have to go back to Van
Buren to find a vice president who succeeded to the presidency.''
He corrected himself after audience members reminded him that
George Bush succeeded Ronald Reagan. Still, that is two vice
presidents elected to succeed a president since 1836.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Clinton fatigue, Frank Newport, editor-in-chief of
the Gallup Organization, said: ``I scratch my head. It's an easy
phrase to use. But I'm inclined to look more at the candidate, that
Gore is doing poorly because of Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael D. McCurry, Clinton's former press secretary, rejects
the concept of Clinton fatigue because, he argued, the public is
too disengaged to be fatigued.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand how, suddenly, people have turned a switch
in their head and said, `I'm tired of Bill Clinton,' '' he said.
``They've spent seven years with this president. He's not in their
face because most people are checked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the characteristics that people say trouble them about
Clinton _ notably his morals _ do not trouble them about Gore. Just
the same, voters do not give Gore much credit for what people see
as Clinton's accomplishments, like prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   The fatigue factor is so tough to gauge that Clinton and Gore
seem uncertain how to grapple with it. Gore is constantly recasting
his relationship with Clinton. First he played loyal lieutenant,
boasting about Clinton-Gore accomplishments. Then he stopped even
mentioning Clinton by name. Then he bluntly condemned the president
for personal transgressions. (Cynics suspects that that was a ploy
hatched with a White House wink to allow Gore to break out on his
own.)
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of one day last week, Gore seemed to shift his
pitch several times. At one point, he criticized his
administration's performance, saying, ``I'm not satisfied.'' Later
in the evening, at an event with the president, he softened,
saying, ``We've been doing a lot of things right, but it is time to
start a wave of change in this nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Gore should not necessarily take personally the
cries of fatigue. ``You can only imagine what the Roosevelt fatigue
was like!'' said James Carville, an architect of Clinton's campaign
in 1992, recalling the 12-year tenure of Franklin D. Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of F.D.R., Gore can take comfort, for voters, far
from fickle, chose continuity over a fresh face: Taking on
Roosevelt in 1944, Thomas E. Dewey assailed the three-term
incumbent for surrounding himself with ``tired old men in
Washington.'' But a tired old man won re-election.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There are people who believe in little green men. A
flat earth. Looming Armageddon. There are others who believe, or at
least say they believe, that cigarettes cause neither addiction nor
disease.
</P>
<P>
   After the executives of the nation's largest cigarette companies
testified about their unconventional beliefs at a congressional
hearing five years ago, Democrats in Congress cried foul and asked
the Justice Department to launch a criminal investigation into
whether they had perjured themselves. After all, the claims ran
counter not only to common sense and mainstream scientific
research, but the industry's own internal documentation.
</P>
<P>
   But in the eyes of the law, ``truthful'' testimony does not
necessarily gibe with what most people know to be true. Even though
little green men do not exist, the earth is not flat, life goes on
and cigarettes are addictive and deadly, those who make such false
assertions under oath or otherwise tap dance around the truth do
not necessarily run afoul of the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course they weren't telling the truth,'' said William
Farone, a former research director at Philip Morris who has since
testified against the tobacco industry. ``That's obvious. Whether
that's against the law or not, you'd have to ask a lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers at the Justice Department, at the same time they were
trumpeting a sweeping civil lawsuit last week against the tobacco
industry, mentioned almost as an afterthought that their criminal
inquiry was dead. Officials never provided the precise reasons for
dropping the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet to many at the time of the executives' April 1994 testimony,
it seemed pretty obvious that they were lying under oath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that nicotine is not addictive,'' said Andrew H.
Tisch, then chief executive of Lorillard Tobacco Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that nicotine is not addictive,'' said Thomas
Sandefur Jr., then head of Brown &AMP; Williamson.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I, too, believe that nicotine is not addictive,'' said
Donald S. Johnston, then head of American Tobacco Co.
</P>
<P>
   The department's criminal investigation, begun soon afterward,
was no cursory review. The department assembled a team of
prosecutors, convened a grand jury and interviewed scores of
witnesses. After years of work, the Special Task Force on Tobacco
even went so far as to notify some executives of possible
indictments, an indication of the seriousness of the probe.
</P>
<P>
   Tapping into documents unearthed in other lawsuits, the Justice
Department used the industry's internal documents to show that
executives did not really believe what they were saying. For
instance, a 1963 memo from a lawyer at Brown &AMP; Williamson had said,
``We are then in the business of selling nicotine, an addictive
drug.''
</P>
<P>
   But just listen to Mark Smith, a Brown &AMP; Williamson spokesman
speaking in 1999, to get an idea of how slippery the truth can be:
``In the '90s, some people are addicted to chocolate. Some people
are addicted to sex. Some people think cigarettes are addicting.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that witnesses before Congress can believe
whatever they want. ``What those executives said before Congress
was basically an opinion,'' said Joseph DiGenova, a former federal
prosecutor in Washington. ``They can believe whatever they want to
believe, even in the face of scientific evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the executives probably did tell whoppers. Four years
after their testimony, another generation of industry heads
appeared before the same panel to say that nicotine was addictive.
</P>
<P>
   But proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the first batch of
executives had committed perjury was as complicated as any cancer
study. A further complication: a 5-year statute of limitations that
lapsed this year.
</P>
<P>
   Perjury cases are about more than just the truth _ which became
abundantly clear during the tortured legal discussions during
President Clinton's impeachment trial. Prosecutors must show an
intent to mislead, a difficult-to-prove standard. Falsehoods pop up
regularly at congressional hearings. Perjury convictions do not.
</P>
<P>
   ``The criminal division devoted a great deal of effort to this
investigation,'' said a Justice official. ``They decided it was not
a case they were likely to win, which is obviously a factor they
have to consider.''
</P>
<P>
   But the government is not finished using the tobacco industry's
words against them. As part of the civil lawsuit filed on
Wednesday, the Justice Department is alleging that the industry has
engaged in fraud and racketeering over the past four decades in
deceiving the public about smoking.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, which has a lower burden of proof than a criminal
matter, lists what the government contends is one lie after another
by the tobacco industry _ like the newspaper ad from 1970, in which
several companies claimed that ``the question about smoking and
health is still a question.''
</P>
<P>
   The civil case may pry loose huge sums of money from company
coffers and force the industry to come clean once and for all on
the dangers of cigarettes. Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass., who first
urged the criminal investigation back in 1994, said his goal may
well be achieved even if no executive is ever charged with a
felony.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was never personal with me,'' Meehan said. ``I didn't
want to put anybody behind bars. I want to save lives and get these
executives to finally acknowledge what we all know to be the
truth.''

flat earth. Looming Armageddon. There are others who believe, or at
least say they believe, that cigarettes cause neither addiction nor
disease.
</P>
<P>
   After the executives of the nation's largest cigarette companies
testified about their unconventional beliefs at a congressional
hearing five years ago, Democrats in Congress cried foul and asked
the Justice Department to launch a criminal investigation into
whether they had perjured themselves. After all, the claims ran
counter not only to common sense and mainstream scientific
research, but the industry's own internal documentation.
</P>
<P>
   But in the eyes of the law, ``truthful'' testimony does not
necessarily gibe with what most people know to be true. Even though
little green men do not exist, the earth is not flat, life goes on
and cigarettes are addictive and deadly, those who make such false
assertions under oath or otherwise tap dance around the truth do
not necessarily run afoul of the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course they weren't telling the truth,'' said William
Farone, a former research director at Philip Morris who has since
testified against the tobacco industry. ``That's obvious. Whether
that's against the law or not, you'd have to ask a lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers at the Justice Department, at the same time they were
trumpeting a sweeping civil lawsuit last week against the tobacco
industry, mentioned almost as an afterthought that their criminal
inquiry was dead. Officials never provided the precise reasons for
dropping the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet to many at the time of the executives' April 1994 testimony,
it seemed pretty obvious that they were lying under oath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that nicotine is not addictive,'' said Andrew H.
Tisch, then chief executive of Lorillard Tobacco Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that nicotine is not addictive,'' said Thomas
Sandefur Jr., then head of Brown &AMP; Williamson.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I, too, believe that nicotine is not addictive,'' said
Donald S. Johnston, then head of American Tobacco Co.
</P>
<P>
   The department's criminal investigation, begun soon afterward,
was no cursory review. The department assembled a team of
prosecutors, convened a grand jury and interviewed scores of
witnesses. After years of work, the Special Task Force on Tobacco
even went so far as to notify some executives of possible
indictments, an indication of the seriousness of the probe.
</P>
<P>
   Tapping into documents unearthed in other lawsuits, the Justice
Department used the industry's internal documents to show that
executives did not really believe what they were saying. For
instance, a 1963 memo from a lawyer at Brown &AMP; Williamson had said,
``We are then in the business of selling nicotine, an addictive
drug.''
</P>
<P>
   But just listen to Mark Smith, a Brown &AMP; Williamson spokesman
speaking in 1999, to get an idea of how slippery the truth can be:
``In the '90s, some people are addicted to chocolate. Some people
are addicted to sex. Some people think cigarettes are addicting.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that witnesses before Congress can believe
whatever they want. ``What those executives said before Congress
was basically an opinion,'' said Joseph DiGenova, a former federal
prosecutor in Washington. ``They can believe whatever they want to
believe, even in the face of scientific evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the executives probably did tell whoppers. Four years
after their testimony, another generation of industry heads
appeared before the same panel to say that nicotine was addictive.
</P>
<P>
   But proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the first batch of
executives had committed perjury was as complicated as any cancer
study. A further complication: a 5-year statute of limitations that
lapsed this year.
</P>
<P>
   Perjury cases are about more than just the truth _ which became
abundantly clear during the tortured legal discussions during
President Clinton's impeachment trial. Prosecutors must show an
intent to mislead, a difficult-to-prove standard. Falsehoods pop up
regularly at congressional hearings. Perjury convictions do not.
</P>
<P>
   ``The criminal division devoted a great deal of effort to this
investigation,'' said a Justice official. ``They decided it was not
a case they were likely to win, which is obviously a factor they
have to consider.''
</P>
<P>
   But the government is not finished using the tobacco industry's
words against them. As part of the civil lawsuit filed on
Wednesday, the Justice Department is alleging that the industry has
engaged in fraud and racketeering over the past four decades in
deceiving the public about smoking.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, which has a lower burden of proof than a criminal
matter, lists what the government contends is one lie after another
by the tobacco industry _ like the newspaper ad from 1970, in which
several companies claimed that ``the question about smoking and
health is still a question.''
</P>
<P>
   The civil case may pry loose huge sums of money from company
coffers and force the industry to come clean once and for all on
the dangers of cigarettes. Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass., who first
urged the criminal investigation back in 1994, said his goal may
well be achieved even if no executive is ever charged with a
felony.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was never personal with me,'' Meehan said. ``I didn't
want to put anybody behind bars. I want to save lives and get these
executives to finally acknowledge what we all know to be the
truth.''

<P>
   The traditional enemies of busing to achieve school integration
were once easy to spot: angry white parents glaring at little black
boys and girls stepping off the bus at a new school.
</P>
<P>
   But as desegregation plans have fallen by the wayside in so many
schools districts _ most recently in Charlotte, N.C., earlier this
month _ it is not whites alone who have favored its demise.
</P>
<P>
   To hear a black parent like Clint Perkins tell it, busing
students to achieve racial integration is ``nothing but a waste of
money'' and, worse, it robs children of the familiar comfort of a
neighborhood school. It was an experiment full of hope, he said,
but short on promise.
</P>
<P>
   In the annals of civil rights, the bus has been a symbol of
power and hope since Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat to a
white man in 1955, sparking a protest that forever changed the
nation. And beginning in the early 1960s the school bus, the
universal symbol of mass transportation, was seen as a way to bring
together a divided nation and forge equality by letting black
children sit next to white children.
</P>
<P>
   But while busing promoted diversity, at least between school
bells, and brought poorer children to more affluent schools, the
enduring racial segregation of city neighborhoods and the
middle-class flight to suburbs have posed a challenge that busing
alone could scarcely solve.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins, an Army recruiter whose daughter attends a public
school in Denver, where busing was ended four years ago, believes
that integration is worthy. But it is the color of money, he said,
that matters most in education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black or white, you need money to attract top-quality
educators,'' he said. ``I don't care about the racial ratio in the
school. What matters most is the quality of education.''
</P>
<P>
   A conservative judiciary has hastened the demise of many
desegregation plans. But in some cases, black parents and
politicians have called for desegregation orders to be lifted, as
in St. Louis, where such an order was vacated earlier this year
after a vow by the state legislature to increase spending on public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Desegregation plans have been scrapped, either voluntarily or by
court order, in a long list of cities, including Boston, Cleveland,
Detroit, Norfolk, Va., and Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights organizations like the NAACP remain steadfast in
their support of integrating schools, including the use of busing
if necessary. But even the NAACP has seen internal discord over the
issue. In the last several years, the group dismissed two chapter
leaders, Robert H. Robinson in Bergen County. N.J., and Kenneth W.
Jenkins in Yonkers, N.Y., for taking the position that good schools
for black students is a higher priority than racial integration.
</P>
<P>
   For many black parents and educators, turning away from support
of busing is simply a matter of political reality, said Glenn
Loury, director of the Institute on Race and Social Division at
Boston University. ``The courts are making it very clear that
busing, as a tool of integration, is going to be very restricted,''
said Loury. ``That's not just the writing on the wall. That's the
writing in the rulings.''
</P>
<P>
   But Loury said it has become quite clear that black parents have
lost much of the hope that busing would transform schools for poor
children. ``Black parents have become much more skeptical that this
is the way of attacking the problem,'' he said. ``They're weary.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet he noted that black parents in Boston are on a long
waiting list to participate in a voluntary busing program, one that
sends children from urban centers to mostly white schools in the
suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the issue of racial integration, Americans have
always been ambivalent about buses. The epitome of poor and
working-class transportation, the bus can be a crowded, noisy place
where deep-rooted distinctions are forfeited during a journey that
is often too close for comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Many schoolchildren have never enjoyed taking the bus for any
reason. The ever-expanding parking lots of suburban high schools
underscore the fading lure of the trusty old yellow school bus.
</P>
<P>
   It comes as no surprise then, that many black (and white)
parents and children sometimes cringe at stepping aboard buses,
especially if it means rolling away from the home neighborhood
toward somebody else's turf.
</P>
<P>
   As desegregation plans have wilted, poor black and Hispanic
students are increasingly isolated in schools that are
predominantly minority, according to Gary Orfield, a Harvard
professor and an expert on segregation.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent study, Orfield found that schools that are more than
90 percent black and Hispanic are 11 times more likely to have
concentrated poverty than mostly white schools.
</P>
<P>
   Poverty in these schools has grown worse, he said, as much of
the black middleclass has moved to the suburbs. He cited studies
that showed only one-tenth of blacks wanted to live in all-black
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of Orfield, money alone cannot remedy the problems
of racial segregation in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``People need to understand what schools are,'' he said. ``It's
not just about test scores. Schools are a place where people
network, where they make the connections to have a better chance at
being successful.''
</P>
<P>
   He also argues that white students benefit profoundly in
integrated settings, learning social skills that will become
required ``as they live in a society that is less and less white.''
</P>
<P>
   But among whites, there has never been much support for busing
or other desegregation plans in schools. And as many blacks also
become skeptical of such efforts, busing seems destined to take a
place among nobly intended but ultimately disappointing ventures to
close the racial chasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a reason that most of these plans were
court-ordered,'' said Loury of Boston University. ``If it was put
to a vote, it would never pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Black parents like Perkins, meanwhile, have increasingly looked
for other measures of a school's success than its racial
composition.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as all the teachers and parents are singing off the
same page,'' he said, ``I don't care what color they are.''

EATING TO REACH YOUR LIFE SPAN. OR, TO EXTEND IT. 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(js) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is there anything you can eat that might make you live a lot
longer? The answer is yes, but it's not entirely pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Tufts University reported last week that elderly
rats fed servings of blueberries performed much better in everyday
lab rat tasks like walking along a narrow rod. One of the
scientists was so impressed with his rodents' regained skills that
he has started eating berries every day.
</P>
<P>
   Nutritionists, an often fractious crowd, agree that fruit and
vegetables are good for you. But there's a difference between
eating for good health _ which may improve the chances of attaining
one's maximum life span _ and eating to extend that natural
maximum.
</P>
<P>
   To improve the odds that no disease gets you before old age
does, the green grocer is your friend. Even blueberries may help,
if you don't mind flashing blue smiles and scrubbing crimson stains
from your shirt.
</P>
<P>
   But it's unlikely that any one food is the true ambrosia. The
real hope lies in genetics, where scientists are beginning to make
real progress. Until they hit the fountain of youth, there's only
one diet that has been proved to extend life. If it works as well
in people as it does in rodents, it will lengthen your life by 25
years. Guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   So why isn't it touted in all those $30 health books that
promise longevity if one bets on the author's prescribed diet?
Doubtless because it can be described in eight words, not a book:
reduce your intake of calories by 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Rats and mice fed on this diet _ which means 40 percent less
than they will eat when allowed as much food as they want _ live a
third longer. Note that this isnot a malnutrition diet: the animals
are given all the vitamins and minerals they need. It's just that
their calories are cut way down.
</P>
<P>
   The upside: you can eat whatever you like. It doesn't seem to
matter whether the calories are in the form of fat or protein or
carbohydrate.
</P>
<P>
   Would a calorically restricted diet work in people as well as it
does in laboratory rodents, which live only a couple of years?
Because people are generally more like monkeys than mice, two
monkey-feeding trials are underway. But since rhesus monkeys can
live 40 years and the trials started only in the late 1980s, no
simian Methuselahs have had time to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   A possible shortcut to finding if caloric restriction helps
people was reported last month by Richard Weindruch, a leader in
animal aging studies, and his colleague, Tomas A. Prolla, both of
the University of Wisconsin. They used a new biological tool called
an Affymetrix chip to measure aging at the cellular level. The chip
can tell what cells are doing by monitoring which genes are
switched on or off.
</P>
<P>
   The chip supported a longstanding theory of aging: that cells
get damaged by oxygen-derived chemicals known as free radicals,
which are created as a by-product of energy production. Cells from
old mice had switched on the genes that deal with free radical
damage, the chip found, whereas in calorically restricted mice of
the same age the damage control genes were quiescent.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer calories, less energy production, less damage to the
cell's mitochondria, as its miniature batteries are called. If the
chip provides a true measure of cellular aging, then it may be
possible to tell whether the monkeys are aging more slowly on their
calorically restricted diet as soon as an appropriate chip can be
developed.
</P>
<P>
   Weindruch says that until he conducted the chip experiment he
had not tried to restrict the calories in his own diet. But he
changed his mind after seeing the effects of dietary intervention.
``Although I have studied caloric restriction for 25 years, the
power of the intervention was such that it changed my behavior and
I'm eating less food,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The study of why organisms age has long been a hopeless
backwater of science. The secrets were locked deep in the cell
beyond researchers' reach. In the past few years, much has changed.
Last year researchers supported by the Geron Corp. made two
spectacular advances _ they learned how to ``immortalize'' ordinary
cells of the human body and how to isolate a naturally immortal
class of cells known as human embryonic stem cells.
</P>
<P>
   Immortal, in biologists' parlance, refers to the ability of
cells grown in glassware to grow and divide indefinitely without
becoming cancerous _ an ability in marked contrast to that of
normal body cells, which can divide only 50 or so times before
hitting senescence.
</P>
<P>
   Immortality of the cell is not the same as immortality of the
entire organism, but the two are not necessarily unrelated. The
very existence of a perpetually enduring cell is proof that
biological systems don't have to rust and decay. They can renew
themselves indefinitely, suggesting that there is no biological
limit on longevity.
</P>
<P>
   That evolution does not design mice or people to live so long is
not because it could not, many biologists believe, but because
there would be no advantage in terms of natural selection. In a
world full of predators, it's better to design organisms that breed
prolifically and die young than ones that can live forever but are
bound to get zapped by saber-toothed tigers at an early age.
</P>
<P>
   Genetically contrived life extension for people may come one
day, but it's not around the corner. For those who wish to do
something now, caloric restriction seems to be the best _ in fact
the only _ bet, even though not yet proved in primates. And
Weindruch, working with mice, has already worked out the answers to
many obvious questions: Don't begin young _ undernutrition stunts
growth. You can start later in life and still get a substantial
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   It's also not necessary to cut calories the full 40 percent:
mice live longer even with a 10 percent calorie reduction, though
the effect is not as pronounced. In a recent article in Scientific
American, Weindruch figured that people would do best ``by
consuming an amount that enabled them to weigh 10 to 25 percent
less than their personal set point,'' which (though often hard for
a person to define) is the weight the body naturally tries to keep
itself at.
</P>
<P>
   So eat what you like _ blueberries, chocolate liqueurs, ice
cream. But mal appetit!

<P>
   But it's unlikely that any one food is the true ambrosia. The
real hope lies in genetics, where scientists are beginning to make
real progress. Until they hit the fountain of youth, there's only
one diet that has been proved to extend life. If it works as well
in people as it does in rodents, it will lengthen your life by 25
years. Guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   So why isn't it touted in all those $30 health books that
promise longevity if one bets on the author's prescribed diet?
Doubtless because it can be described in eight words, not a book:
reduce your intake of calories by 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Rats and mice fed on this diet _ which means 40 percent less
than they will eat when allowed as much food as they want _ live a
third longer. Note that this isnot a malnutrition diet: the animals
are given all the vitamins and minerals they need. It's just that
their calories are cut way down.
</P>
<P>
   The upside: you can eat whatever you like. It doesn't seem to
matter whether the calories are in the form of fat or protein or
carbohydrate.
</P>
<P>
   Would a calorically restricted diet work in people as well as it
does in laboratory rodents, which live only a couple of years?
Because people are generally more like monkeys than mice, two
monkey-feeding trials are underway. But since rhesus monkeys can
live 40 years and the trials started only in the late 1980s, no
simian Methuselahs have had time to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   A possible shortcut to finding if caloric restriction helps
people was reported last month by Richard Weindruch, a leader in
animal aging studies, and his colleague, Tomas A. Prolla, both of
the University of Wisconsin. They used a new biological tool called
an Affymetrix chip to measure aging at the cellular level. The chip
can tell what cells are doing by monitoring which genes are
switched on or off.
</P>
<P>
   The chip supported a longstanding theory of aging: that cells
get damaged by oxygen-derived chemicals known as free radicals,
which are created as a by-product of energy production. Cells from
old mice had switched on the genes that deal with free radical
damage, the chip found, whereas in calorically restricted mice of
the same age the damage control genes were quiescent.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer calories, less energy production, less damage to the
cell's mitochondria, as its miniature batteries are called. If the
chip provides a true measure of cellular aging, then it may be
possible to tell whether the monkeys are aging more slowly on their
calorically restricted diet as soon as an appropriate chip can be
developed.
</P>
<P>
   Weindruch says that until he conducted the chip experiment he
had not tried to restrict the calories in his own diet. But he
changed his mind after seeing the effects of dietary intervention.
``Although I have studied caloric restriction for 25 years, the
power of the intervention was such that it changed my behavior and
I'm eating less food,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The study of why organisms age has long been a hopeless
backwater of science. The secrets were locked deep in the cell
beyond researchers' reach. In the past few years, much has changed.
Last year researchers supported by the Geron Corp. made two
spectacular advances _ they learned how to ``immortalize'' ordinary
cells of the human body and how to isolate a naturally immortal
class of cells known as human embryonic stem cells.
</P>
<P>
   Immortal, in biologists' parlance, refers to the ability of
cells grown in glassware to grow and divide indefinitely without
becoming cancerous _ an ability in marked contrast to that of
normal body cells, which can divide only 50 or so times before
hitting senescence.
</P>
<P>
   Immortality of the cell is not the same as immortality of the
entire organism, but the two are not necessarily unrelated. The
very existence of a perpetually enduring cell is proof that
biological systems don't have to rust and decay. They can renew
themselves indefinitely, suggesting that there is no biological
limit on longevity.
</P>
<P>
   That evolution does not design mice or people to live so long is
not because it could not, many biologists believe, but because
there would be no advantage in terms of natural selection. In a
world full of predators, it's better to design organisms that breed
prolifically and die young than ones that can live forever but are
bound to get zapped by saber-toothed tigers at an early age.
</P>
<P>
   Genetically contrived life extension for people may come one
day, but it's not around the corner. For those who wish to do
something now, caloric restriction seems to be the best _ in fact
the only _ bet, even though not yet proved in primates. And
Weindruch, working with mice, has already worked out the answers to
many obvious questions: Don't begin young _ undernutrition stunts
growth. You can start later in life and still get a substantial
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   It's also not necessary to cut calories the full 40 percent:
mice live longer even with a 10 percent calorie reduction, though
the effect is not as pronounced. In a recent article in Scientific
American, Weindruch figured that people would do best ``by
consuming an amount that enabled them to weigh 10 to 25 percent
less than their personal set point,'' which (though often hard for
a person to define) is the weight the body naturally tries to keep
itself at.
</P>
<P>
   So eat what you like _ blueberries, chocolate liqueurs, ice
cream. But mal appetit!

<P>
   Readers of a certain age should have no trouble alerting young
viewers to the identities of the main characters in the new version
of ``Animal Farm'' to be telecast on TNT on Sunday, Oct. 3: That
show pig, Old Major, is a stand-in for Lenin; that vicious-looking
porker, Napoleon, can be nobody but Stalin, and that sometime
comrade, Snowball, soon to be on the trot from Stalin, is Trotsky.
</P>
<P>
   The famous 1945 fable is, of course, George Orwell's take on
what he called ``the Soviet myth'' of the Bolshevik Revolution and
its corruption of the ideal of communism, but his other writings as
a whole are less tough on Napoleon/Stalin than on left-wing Western
apologists for the dictator and his regime. They, more than Russian
propagandists, drew his fire.
</P>
<P>
   In a preface to the 1947 Ukrainian translation of ``Animal
Farm'' (for Soviet exiles) Orwell, a lifelong socialist, explained
that he got the idea from seeing a 10-year-old boy in an English
village whipping a huge cart horse (the model for the strong but
stupid Boxer): ``It struck me that if only such animals became
aware of their strength we should have no power over them, and that
men exploit animals in much the same way as the rich exploit the
proletariat.''
</P>
<P>
   Orwell attributed his book's rejection by several major British
publishers to editors with a soft spot for communist claims to a
nonexploitive society and a disinclination to criticize a wartime
ally. In 1944, he wrote to T.S. Eliot of the ``imbecile suggestion
that some other animal than pigs might be made to represent
Bolsheviks.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite what his parable conveys, Orwell did not credit the
contention among admirers of Lenin and Trotsky that perverse
developments in the Soviet Union dated from the ascendance of
Stalin. He wrote in a 1946 magazine article that ``all the seeds of
evil were there from the start'' and that things would not have
been substantially different if Lenin or Trotsky had remained in
control.
</P>
<P>
   He even found a conciliatory word in the introduction to the
Ukrainian translation of ``Animal Farm'' for the Stalin gang's
``barbaric and undemocratic methods,'' on the grounds that with the
best of intentions they might have had difficulty acting otherwise
under the pressing conditions after the revolution.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Orwell saw it, that excuse was not available to Western
writers, whose job was not to concoct apologies for a murderous
regime but to expose it. And that, he charged repeatedly, was what
many on the British Labor Party's left wing failed to do from the
1930s through the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   He found them succumbing to a theory he described as
``catastrophic gradualism.'' Propagated by defenders of the Soviet
Union in all its ugliest manifestations, this theory held that
purges, deportations and the secret police were the price of
progress. If the advance toward the communist millennium
nevertheless turned out to be slow or imperceptible, that was laid
to ``human nature.''
</P>
<P>
   The popular (and Popular Front) formula, he noted, was ``You
can't make an omelet without breaking eggs.'' However, he added, if
someone replied, ``Yes, but where's the omelet?'' the answer was
likely to be ``Oh well, you can't expect everything to happen in a
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   About a year after the publication of ``Animal Farm,'' Orwell
attended a meeting of Britain's Pen Club, where his opinion of the
sorry condition of much of British socialism was confirmed.
Moscow's purges of old comrades were cheered, and there was no
breath of criticism for the regime.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, he came down hard on writers who had betrayed
their vocation. Not long after the Pen Club meeting, in an essay
called ``The Prevention of Literature,'' he wrote, ``The fog of
lies and misinformation that surrounds such subjects as the Ukraine
famine, the Spanish civil war, Russian policy in Poland and so
forth is not due entirely to conscious dishonesty, but any writer
or journalist who is fully sympathetic to the USSR _ sympathetic,
that is, in the way the Russians themselves would want him to be _
does have to acquiesce in deliberate falsification on important
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   It exasperated him that even when it came to strictly literary
judgments, left-wing philistines hewed to the Soviet line. They
attacked ``highbrows'' and relied on a version of political
correctness as a cultural guide: ``X is a political enemy:
Therefore he is a bad writer.'' So much for the likes of Eliot and
other modernists whose work he admired.
</P>
<P>
   In his indictment of the writer who succumbed to pressure or
incentives to adjust his opinions and ``switch his allegiance at
exactly the right moment'' in accord with the political winds from
the East, as many did in concocting rationalizations for Soviet
flip-flops regarding Hitler's Germany, Orwell observed, ``He must
either tell lies about his subjective feelings or else suppress
them altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   He warned that such is the road to a writer's destruction: ``Not
only will ideas refuse to come to him, but the very words he uses
will seem to stiffen under his touch.''
</P>
<P>
   That, taught Orwell, a staunch supporter of the democratic left
and of the sanctity of the word, was the inevitable price of
totalitarianism. The certain punishment for those on the fellow
travelers' farm: ``Good writing stops.''

   WASHINGTON _ The way Republicans were acting last week it was
almost as if some of them could not decide which was more
uncomfortable: having Pat Buchanan leave the party or John McCain
stay in it.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Buchanan, McCain, the senior senator from Arizona, has
said he is a Republican through and through with no interest in
making a third party bid for the presidency. Yet as he wages his
campaign for the Republican presidential nomination he has a way of
casting a searing light on his party.
</P>
<P>
   Take McCain's call for Republicans to stand ``on principle'' and
bid Buchanan goodbye because of his isolationist views on World War
II and questions about whether Hitler was a threat to the United
States after his air force was defeated in the Battle of Britain.
The senator was met with either disagreement or cautious silence by
the other Republican presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take a bye on this,'' a spokesman for Elizabeth Dole said
initially. It took another day for Mrs. Dole to say Buchanan's
comments ``are grossly insensitive to those Americans who gave
their lives and those veterans who fought and suffered greatly to
preserve freedom in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, an aide to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas said
America's soldiers ``were fighting for freedom.'' Then, on Friday,
Bush himself urged Buchanan not to bolt the Republican Party,
saying ``I'm going to need every vote I can get among Republicans
to win the election.''
</P>
<P>
   The hesitation baffled other Republicans. ``It seems a moment in
which the Republican Party can rid of itself of the unfair
characterization of being extremist,'' said Marshall Wittmann, a
political analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation. ``Yet
there's a bewildering reluctance to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the fracas that ensued last week when an array of
conservative groups including Americans for Tax Reform, the
Christian Coalition, the National Rifle Association and the
National Right to Life Committee journeyed to two key primary
states to denounce McCain for his campaign finance bill, which
would ban unlimited and unregulated donations to political parties.
Usually these are groups that are treated with reverence by
Republicans because they can mobilize conservative voters. But the
McCain campaign fired right back at the critics, noting that some
of them are lobbyists paid by companies and business interests that
make so-called soft money donations.
</P>
<P>
   Grover Norquist, the head of Americans for Tax Reform, was
philosophical, saying that while Buchanan and McCain ``both have
assets for the party they are each running for president in an odd
way.'' He said McCain ``has been seeking editorial approval from
The New York Times and The Washington Post at the expense of the
Republican base.'' And Buchanan ``thinks you can run for president
without the business community,'' Norquist said. ``That's odd,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, who is the national co-chairman of
the McCain campaign, said: ``John McCain is just being John
McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   But for those less happy with the kinds of waves McCain causes
in conservative ranks it could be the beginning of a long few
months. After all, McCain does not even make his candidacy official
until Monday.

GETTING TOUGH GETS TOUGH FOR AUSTRALIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(js) 
 By JANE PERLEZ    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ For more than two decades, Australia has
been trying to promote itself as part of Asia. Now, in East Timor,
it has found out how unnerving that concept can be when put to the
test.
</P>
<P>
   Having led the charge to intervene and having taken command of
the international peace keeping force in East Timor, this
easy-going, underpopulated, high-living country is having to ponder
the cost. Three questions seem to be on everyone's mind:
</P>
<P>
   How can Australia intervene in East Timor, even with the
reluctant acquiescence of the Indonesian government, and still
maintain friendly relations with Indonesia, its closest Asian
neighbor?
</P>
<P>
   How much can Australia still depend on the United States, its
big brother ally of the last 50 years, having seen Washington send
only a token force to help out in East Timor?
</P>
<P>
   And now that Washington has deputized it to do the neighborhood
policing job, does Australia have the political and financial
wherewithal to follow through on its own?
</P>
<P>
   For Australia, which has an army of only 24,000 soldiers _ about
the same number the Indonesian army had in East Timor alone _ these
are milestone questions.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Australia sent soldiers to the battlefields of World War
II, to Korea and Vietnam and lately to the Persian Gulf War. But
those soldiers were dispatched with alacrity, with everyone
understanding that the post-1945 commitments were an investment in
an alliance that the United States was leading. This time,
Australia is carrying the big burden.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 1970s, when Australia lifted a so-called White
Australia policy that had strictly limited Asian immigration,
successive governments have tried to position Australia to be with
Asia rather than against it, if always under the umbrella of U.S.
security.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Australia cozied up to Indonesia, the world's
fourth most populous nation and its closest neighbor. In 1975, it
ignored the East Timor independence movement and instead endorsed
the Indonesian takeover of the territory after the Portuguese
colonial government left. That made Australia the only country to
formally recognize the invasion, although the United States, which
also favored Indonesia's anti-communist government, did not object.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with the idea of building its own strategic solidarity
with Indonesia, the Australian government went on to help train the
Indonesian army, including _ to its current embarrassment _ some of
its feared security forces. In 1995, Australia thought it was
cementing its ties by signing a defense treaty with Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a problem with the East Timor policy all along,
and it became apparent as complaints of Indonesian brutality there
persisted. Australians, who tend to sympathize with underdogs
anyway, have long had a special sympathy for the East Timorese, who
in World War II helped Australian soldiers trapped in Timor's
mountains during the fight against the Japanese. Moreover, the East
Timorese, most of whom are Roman Catholic, have forged strong bonds
with the Catholic Church in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   So after Indonesia's longtime dictator, Suharto, was forced from
office by popular upheaval last year, Australia's conservative
prime minister, John Howard, wrote to the new Indonesian leader,
B.J. Habibie, and suggested that Indonesia sponsor a referendum for
East Timor's autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   The Howard government was surprised when Habibie went a step
further and decided to hold a referendum for independence, which
many in the West, including the Australian Defense Ministry,
believed would lead to bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   But the Australians and the United States held their breaths and
hoped for the best, even when the Indonesians refused to accept a
peacekeeping force in East Timor during the preparations for the
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after the referendum produced a landslide for
independence, the Australian government was taken aback by the
killings of civilians and the scorched earth tactics of the
Indonesian army and militias.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Australians decided to get tough, they were also
taken aback by Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Howard said Australia could not stand by as East Timor burned,
and he said U.S. troops should operate alongside Australians in
East Timor. What he heard in response was sobering. ``If you
thought the Pentagon was not keen to go to Kosovo, you should have
seen their reaction to going to East Timor,'' said one Australian
official.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. national security adviser, Sandy Berger, went so far as
to point out publicly that the United States had fought in Kosovo
because it was in Europe ``I think we have to recognize that
Indonesia is in Asia,'' he said. So Washington has committed just
200 troops for the operation, most of them for logistics, and only
100 for East Timor itself. It was hardly the commitment Australia
had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   An optimist might find a good side to this. Australia won points
in Washington because it was setting a precedent that was
comfortable for the Americans: It was leading a regional
peacekeeping force, sent in harmony with U.S. policy, that did not
require the use of U.S. muscle itself. That contrasts with the
reluctance of Britain and France to commit troops to Balkan
peacekeeping operations unless Americans were alongside on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike the Europeans, who were reluctant to go into Kosovo,
the Australians showed themselves to be adults and to take part in
adult supervision,'' said Douglas Paal, a member of the Bush
administration's National Security Council who now heads the Asia
Pacific Policy Center, a Washington research institute. ``The
Australians were not waiting for Uncle Sam. That's the kind of
alliance partners we want.''
</P>
<P>
   From the Australian point of view, such praise was small
consolation, and the slow and small response of the United States
felt more like a coming-of-age lesson. After World War II,
Australians turned away from Britain and toward the United States
as their new natural ally in the Pacific. Washington put defense
and intelligence installations in Australia and the two countries
exchanged sensitive information freely. The conventional wisdom
here was that similar values of democracy, free enterprise and a
sunny optimism bonded the Australians and the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, they do. But now Australians have been told, in
effect, that the bond is not a free one. With defense spending at
the equivalent of less than $10 billion _ only 1.8 percent of the
gross domestic product _ the commitment to East Timor of 2,000
soldiers _ to rise to 4,500 in coming weeks _ is more than the
current military budget can bear, Australia's preeminent defense
analyst, Paul Dibbs, said. Last week, Australia started to call up
reservists.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest cost of the East Timor commitment for Australia
will likely be its long-fostered relationship with Indonesia. It is
now in tatters. During the recent crisis, Habibie refused to take a
telephone call from Howard, and last week the Indonesian government
scrapped the defense treaty. Australian businesses have become
targets for vandals in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   As for the relationship with Washington, the ties will no doubt
endure, but not with the same open-hearted enthusiasm from Down
Under. Max Walsh, the editor in chief of The Bulletin, a weekly
news magazine in Australia, wrote last week: ``Timor has changed
our world.''

GETTING TOUGH GETS TOUGH FOR AUSTRALIA

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ For more than two decades, Australia has
been trying to promote itself as part of Asia. Now, in East Timor,
it has found out how unnerving that concept can be when put to the
test.
</P>
<P>
   Having led the charge to intervene and having taken command of
the international peace keeping force in East Timor, this
easy-going, underpopulated, high-living country is having to ponder
the cost. Three questions seem to be on everyone's mind:
</P>
<P>
   How can Australia intervene in East Timor, even with the
reluctant acquiescence of the Indonesian government, and still
maintain friendly relations with Indonesia, its closest Asian
neighbor?
</P>
<P>
   How much can Australia still depend on the United States, its
big brother ally of the last 50 years, having seen Washington send
only a token force to help out in East Timor?
</P>
<P>
   And now that Washington has deputized it to do the neighborhood
policing job, does Australia have the political and financial
wherewithal to follow through on its own?
</P>
<P>
   For Australia, which has an army of only 24,000 soldiers _ about
the same number the Indonesian army had in East Timor alone _ these
are milestone questions.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Australia sent soldiers to the battlefields of World War
II, to Korea and Vietnam and lately to the Persian Gulf War. But
those soldiers were dispatched with alacrity, with everyone
understanding that the post-1945 commitments were an investment in
an alliance that the United States was leading. This time,
Australia is carrying the big burden.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 1970s, when Australia lifted a so-called White
Australia policy that had strictly limited Asian immigration,
successive governments have tried to position Australia to be with
Asia rather than against it, if always under the umbrella of U.S.
security.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Australia cozied up to Indonesia, the world's
fourth most populous nation and its closest neighbor. In 1975, it
ignored the East Timor independence movement and instead endorsed
the Indonesian takeover of the territory after the Portuguese
colonial government left. That made Australia the only country to
formally recognize the invasion, although the United States, which
also favored Indonesia's anti-communist government, did not object.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with the idea of building its own strategic solidarity
with Indonesia, the Australian government went on to help train the
Indonesian army, including _ to its current embarrassment _ some of
its feared security forces. In 1995, Australia thought it was
cementing its ties by signing a defense treaty with Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a problem with the East Timor policy all along,
and it became apparent as complaints of Indonesian brutality there
persisted. Australians, who tend to sympathize with underdogs
anyway, have long had a special sympathy for the East Timorese, who
in World War II helped Australian soldiers trapped in Timor's
mountains during the fight against the Japanese. Moreover, the East
Timorese, most of whom are Roman Catholic, have forged strong bonds

   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ When Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit of Turkey
meets with President Clinton and congressional leaders in
Washington this week, there will be much talk about earthquake
relief, geopolitics and obscure though important matters like trade
arbitration and oil pipeline routes. But on Capitol Hill and
elsewhere in the United States, those matters pale into
insignificance. There the great question is at once simpler and
more complex: How democratic is Turkey?
</P>
<P>
   To the extent that Americans think about Turkey, this is the
question they most want answered. They want Turkey to stop jailing
people for giving speeches or writing articles, and to grant its
citizens the level of freedom enjoyed by most Americans and
Europeans. Otherwise, no matter how much progress is made on
international issues, Americans will continue to group Turkey with
Peru, Malaysia, Belarus, Zimbabwe and other quasi-democracies where
human rights have been pushed aside in favor of what ruling
autocrats consider issues of national security.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey has built a vibrant economy, given equality to women and
created a remarkably open society. Yet precisely because the nation
is so Western-oriented, its people have become impatient for full
Western-style democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish military commanders still enjoy the right of veto over
important government decisions. A highly conservative political
elite enforces laws that restrict free expression and other civil
rights. Nonetheless, Ecevit and his aides come to Washington with a
relatively good human rights story to tell. ``They clearly have
more to show in terms of actions, laws, decrees and actual shifts
on the ground than any other recent government of Turkey,''` said
one Clinton administration official.
</P>
<P>
   Government-sponsored assassins who terrorized the mostly Kurdish
provinces of southeastern Turkey for years seem to have packed
their guns away. Radio stations there are now allowed to play
Kurdish music. The Parliament has approved a repentance law for
Kurdish rebels, albeit a highly limited one. In Turkish prisons,
according to Sir Nigel Rodley, a U. N. investigator, there has been
``a reduction in the incidence of the more brutal forms of
torture.''
</P>
<P>
   That statement reflects Turkey's dilemma. Its human rights
record, not just regarding torture but in all important areas, is
better than it has been in years. But it still falls short of what
the West considers to be minimum standards.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the greatest pressure for improvement in Turkey's
human rights climate comes not from Washington or European
capitals, but from within Turkey itself. Millions of Turks, many of
them outraged by the state's failure to react effectively to last
month's earthquake, have begun demanding sweeping reforms and the
repeal of laws that restrict democracy. Even some senior
politicians have joined the chorus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turkey understands more clearly than ever how urgent it is for
us to create a civil society built on democracy and social
justice,'' said Mehmet Ali Irtemcelik, a cabinet minister
responsible for human rights and relations with Europe. ``We must
bring our country to the level of modern civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   Although these views are widely shared, many powerful figures
still resist them. This week, President Clinton will probably
encourage Ecevit to embrace the reform movement and overrule those,
including military commanders and senior members of his own
coalition government, who fear its consequences.
</P>
<P>
   This autumn will be full of challenges for Turkey. In November
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
places human rights at the top of its agenda, will hold a summit in
Istanbul. A month later the European Union, which has also looked
skeptically at Turkey's human rights record, will decide whether to
make the nation an official candidate for membership.
</P>
<P>
   Ecevit is acutely aware that the world is watching to see how he
deals with a handful of high-profile human rights cases.
Foreigners, along with millions of Turks, will be thrilled if final
decisions are made to punish police officers who tortured teen-age
prisoners in Manisa in 1995, others who beat the journalist Metin
Goktepe to death in 1996, and prison guards who killed 10 Kurdish
prisoners in Diyarbakir following a riot that same year.
</P>
<P>
   This month one of Turkey's best-known prisoners, the pro-Kurdish
sociologist Ismail Besikci, was released from prison. He was warned
that he would be sent back to prison if he again violates laws
against publishing subversive opinions, but his release was
nonetheless welcomed by human rights advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Other prisoners whose cases have attracted worldwide attention
include Akin Birdal, head of the country's largest human rights
group; Leyla Zana, a Kurd who is a former member of Parliament and
whose supporters in Europe and the United States have made her
probably the most famous Turkish citizen in the world, and the
blind lawyer Esber Yagmurdereli, who has been convicted of
supporting terrorism on the basis of evidence that human rights
groups say was fabricated. Yagmurdereli has spent 16 of his 54
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree that the human rights situation in Turkey is
improving,'' he said in a telephone interview from prison. ``It's
the result of several factors, including a lull in the Kurdish war,
improved relations with the European Union, and the better climate
that has followed the earthquake. But in truly democratic
countries, people are guaranteed basic freedoms. That still isn't
the case here.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Everyone seems to be looking for a tip
 &HT;    For release Sept. 29, 1999.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It caught me by surprise. As I stood at the take-out window of a
popular barbecue haunt, one of the counter men thrust a quart-sized
styrofoam cup toward me. Scratched in red were the words ``Tips
Please.''
</P>
<P>
   I declined.
</P>
<P>
   Soliciting for tips has become a cottage industry and, to me,
ranks high in the bad taste bracket. The day prior to my encounter
with the counter man, I received an unconventional renewal notice
from my local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The invoice, in addition to the cost of the newspaper for
another year, left a space for what it called ``Carrier Tip.'' It
was marked ``optional,'' but I wondered if I gave a tip there,
would my newspaper carrier stop sending me insincere Christmas
cards with his or her home address on a return envelope?
</P>
<P>
   Walk into donut shops these days, and there's a tip box _
usually handmade _ atop the counter where the donuts and coffee are
passed across to you. Places such as McDonald's and Burger King
are, thankfully, havens from such tip appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Several months ago, I charged dinner at a national chain seafood
restaurant. When my credit slip came for me to sign, there was
incremental information on it. It told me how much to tip if I
wanted to tip 15 percent, how much at 20 percent and how much at 25
percent; right on down to the penny. The restaurant likely thinks
it is providing a service but I was alienated.
</P>
<P>
   Before anyone in the food service industry starts calling for my
head, let me say that I am a 20 percent tipper. Most food servers
are horribly underpaid and dependent upon tips. I start at 20
percent and only if the service is sour do I reduce it to 15
percent. There are times when I tip more but I don't want my wife
to know that.
</P>
<P>
   My take on tipping and food service is that the server is my
representative in the restaurant's kitchen. I tell the server what
I want, declare what I don't want _ raw onions, mayonnaise,
well-done meat, etc _ and that person takes the order to the
kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   It is his or her obligation to see that the chef honors my
wishes. I don't want to be served a sandwich with mayonnaise on it
when I have told the server I did not want that. ``Oh, I told the
chef not to put mayonnaise on it,'' the server likely would
counter, fending off accountability. ``Not good enough,'' my
thought process goes, ``you should have checked it yourself _
you're working for me; i.e. tips.''
</P>
<P>
   Anytime you have to send something back, the server has failed.
The size of the gratuity should be based on that criteria.
</P>
<P>
   With take-out joints, it's entirely different. These people do
not serve you in the manner of restaurant servers. They slip some
donuts into a bag and hand it to you. Or they put some spare ribs
into a styrofoam box and slide it across the counter. There's no
personal service involved. Most of the time, you really don't know
what you have (or don't have) until you get it home and open the
bag. At times, what you ordered and what you received are
unrelated.
</P>
<P>
   As for my newspaper delivery person _ the 5:30 a.m. type _ I've
never seen him or her in my life but still respond to the vaguely
obscured Christmas card appeal with a financial gift _ but not at
subscription renewal time too.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know how or where, the idea of tipping for everything
came into being. I strongly suspect the Europeans as they have
built in a percentage service charge to your restaurant bill.
Tipping is not an option there; only the prospect of leaving
additional funds following excellent service.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder at bosses who allow their employees to display crude
tip containers on the counter, or add the option as part of a
formal invoice. It does not enhance the image of the establishment
_ and also indicates that the people who work for them are not
being paid well enough to get by on just their salaries. So they
beg.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Another slap at the presidency
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's sometimes the oddments of news that tell us what's really
going on _ buried stories, perhaps draped over an appliance-sale
ad.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton has dropped out as next year's Jefferson
Lecturer on the Humanities, selected by the National Endowment for
the Humanities.You probably didn't know he'd even been scheduled to
speak. Few did.
</P>
<P>
   But his retreat under fire tells us something very large, and
not very pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   It tells us that the hatchet-job partisanship of the '90s has so
hacked up the presidency no occupant of it may any longer be taken
as speaking from it with other than degraded motives.
</P>
<P>
   Academia went quite bananas at the prospect of Clinton taking a
lectern occupied in the past by historian Barbara Tuchman, poet
Gwendolyn Brooks, novelist Robert Penn Warren and other
intellectual swanks.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the scholarly community has little to engage it, outside
faculty-lounge spats and scrounging space in esoteric journals. The
chance to boo a president off stage as an unworthy, jumped-up
Arkansas pig farmer offered high drama. It is an indignity,
apparently, to be addressed by the president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The cultural right's umbrage king, the ever-appalled William
Bennett, sputtered boilerplate outrage, too: ``This is horrible,
corrupt, but it fits the pattern of this administration. ...
Clinton has not only been corrupted; he has corrupted all of those
around him, and this is an example of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Whew. Hey, the guy was just gonna give a little talk, and on an
occasion exceeded in its importance only by its obscurity. Western
Civilization does not hang in the balance here.
</P>
<P>
   And Republicans suspect the invitation as a political payoff by
the endowment chairman, a Clinton appointee. Maybe William R.
Ferris IS a suck-up, but he said he thought that starting a
tradition of presidential lecturers would raise the visibility of
the annual Jefferson series and set up a nice chance for presidents
to speak away from their usual agendized forums.
</P>
<P>
   It WAS a good idea, or ought to have been. Asking our presidents
for once to think out loud with us, rather than just pitching us,
would cool the fevers of politics and allow for a welcome civic
moment. Some, of course, would abuse the platform or dog it,
sloughing the chore off to staff hacks. Even that, however, would
be telling.
</P>
<P>
   But we're having none of it. The relentless partisanship of
recent years has cost us the ability to understand a president as
ever representing the presidency, as opposed to the politics that
got him to it. To occupy the office is not to be enlarged by it but
to be diminished in it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself contributed to this slide. But the hardball
campaign to demonize him, and to deny Clinton the presidency in
substance if not in form, began with his election, not his
misadventure. That campaign is waning now, in self-satisfaction.
But it has cost the rest of us some measure of our sense of
community beyond partisanship and has left us, in poor recompense,
only muddled disillusion.

   1. THE COLLECTOR By Deborah Solomon - From The New York Times
Magazine ``Sensation: Young British Artists From the Saatchi
Collection,'' opened at the Royal Academy of Arts in London, two
years ago, and academicians resigned in disgust, protesters hurled
eggs and radio news bulletins led off with dispatches from ``the
Royal Academy of Porn,'' as The Daily Mail rechristened the museum.
This year in New York the show was expected to be much less
controversial when it opened at the Brooklyn Museum of Art, on Oct.
2. The prior week, however, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani called the
artwork ``sick stuff'' and threatened to cut off the museum's
funding if it didn't cancel the show - pretty much assuring that
Saatchi's collection, yet again, will be a smash hit. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------2. GEORGE C.
SCOTT: ACTING WAS ALL THERE WAS By Ivor Davis (Includes a color
photo, available electronically or in hard copy, of the late George
C. Scott as he appeared in ``12 Angry Men.'') - 1,400 words A
special appreciation of actor George C. Scott, including
never-before-published excerpts from one of Scott's final
interviews, conducted earlier this year. Scott looks back on his
career, explains his philosophy of acting and remembers the
director Stanley Kubrick, who directed Scott's personal favorite of
his own films - ``Dr. Strangelove'' (1964) - and why he refused
Kubrick's offer to appear in the classic film,``2001.'' 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------3. GET READY,
HERE COMES THE EXOATMOSPHERIC KILL VEHICLE By Peter Maass - From
The New York Times Magazine America is preparing for a nuclear war
again. Within the Raytheon Missile Systems factory, on the
outskirts of Tucson, Ariz., the top ballistic technicians are
putting the final touches on a weapon that is supposed to protect
America from Armageddon. It is called the Exoatmospheric Kill
Vehicle and it is supposed to fly through space at 4,500 miles an
hour, hit its target's warhead and obliterate it. (Peter Maass is
the author of ``Love Thy Neighbor: A Story of War,'' about covering
the war in Bosnia.)

   4. GERMANY'S INTERNET POLICE: IT IS NOT EASY TO PATROL THE WEB -
From Der Spiegel - 1,000 words Since the beginning of the year, a
20-member unit of Germany's federal investigative police has been
patrolling the Internet, looking for evidence of kiddy pornography,
software piracy, money-laundering, data theft, credit card
swindlers, unlawful drug sellers or illegal neo-Nazi Web sites.
What they find is shocking -- Internet sites portraying the sexual
abuse of toddlers, for example. But doing anything about it, the
Germans have found, is not an easy matter. More and more,
governments are wrestling with ways to control the amorphous,
fast-growing giant known as the Internet without strangling it to
death. So far they have had little success. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------5. MAN EMERGES,
STILL BREATHING, AFTER E-CAVE CONFINEMENT By Matt Richtel - From
The New York Times E-Commerce - 1,700 words E-commerce has
revolutionized the selling of books, compact disks, travel and
financial services and computer hardware and software - commodities
shoppers don't need to squeeze and prod to get a handle on. But
will the on-line bazaar work for everyday survival? In an attempt
to find out, writer Matt Richtel sealed himself into an E-cave. For
five days, he ordered all sustenance and entertainment from the
Net. He survived, but will he ever be the same? Here, he offers his
diary. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------6. TOO YOUNG TO
BUY? by Jay Rayner - From Prospect The most successful rock and pop
bands are no longer discovered playing in dingy pubs, they are
created by agents and producers. And their target market is often
children as young as five. Is this harmless fun or should we be
concerned about hard-sell techniques being used on suggestible
children? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------7. TEENSELTOWN
- DESPERATE TO SEEM 16 by Lynn Hirschberg From The New York Times
Magazine For the entertainment industry, the money is in
teen-agers. For aspiring actresses, and actors too, making it in
Hollywood means making it right now - before you look 20.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Last year, Michael DiPaolo was weighing competitive job offers
from technology companies in the South and Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   That Cheetah Technologies was launching a subsidized day care
center this summer at its Bradenton, Fla., offices made his
decision easier. He started his new job as associate product
manager there two days after his son, Michael, was born.
</P>
<P>
   ''I liked the company anyway, but that kind of put it over the
top,''DiPaolo said.
</P>
<P>
   It also didn't hurt that Cheetah, which makes monitoring
equipment and software for the cable TV and telecommunications
industries, recently opened a fitness center on site and plans to
open a cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   ''But the best thing was day care,'' said DiPaolo.
</P>
<P>
   ''At lunch, you can go play with your kid for a half an hour,
and you get perspective _ if you're having a bad day you realize
it's not that bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Cheetah, many employers realize that in today's tight labor
market, helping workers juggle the hectic demands of work and
family can reap big payoffs not only in snaring qualified workers,
but in keeping them.
</P>
<P>
   While salaries and signing bonuses remain key executive
bargaining chips, more companies nationwide are experimenting with
a smorgasbord of perks _ flexible schedules, day care for children,
elder care for parents, gyms, massages, subsidized meals and
financial, concierge and counseling services.
</P>
<P>
   In today's shrinking work force, they want to be employers of
choice. A family-friendly philosophy called work-life management
has largely replaced the traditional view that professional and
personal lives orbit independently.
</P>
<P>
   ''It comes down to recruitment and retention,'' said Robin
Hardman of Families and Work Institute, a New York independent
research firm.''By and large, it's for bottom-line reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   The firm's research indicates that happy workers are productive
workers, and they tend to stay put.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 Families and Work Institute study of 1,057 companies and
nonprofits with more than 100 employees found that those in
supportive workplaces are more satisfied with their jobs, more
loyal to their companies and more inclined to remain there.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, workers in less supportive sites have more stress,
worse moods and less energy away from work. And when jobs
compromise personal and family well-being, problems at home
boomerang at work, impairing job performance.
</P>
<P>
   ''Life is more complicated today,'' said Hardman. ''Everyone is
trying to do a lot more things at once.''
</P>
<P>
   And not just Americans. Workers worldwide seek more balance
between careers and personal lives, according to a poll of more
than 10,000 people conducted by Gemini Consulting and Yankelovich
Partners.
</P>
<P>
   Those in the United States, Europe and Japan said they value
balance the most _ only Russians said decent wages are more
important. French employees are the happiest; Japanese, the
unhappiest.
</P>
<P>
   ''Workplaces today need more flexible employees just as much as
employees need more flexible workplaces,'' Hardman said.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the traditional 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. routine is only one of
four schedules available since last year to nearly 600 FCCI
Insurance Group employees in the Southeast region.
</P>
<P>
   Employees can choose the starting time of each eight-hour day
during a flexible five-day work week, work four 10-hour days or
take the 10th day off after toiling 80 hours within nine days.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, these arrangements have their limits.
</P>
<P>
   ''It needs to be reasonable for what the job is,'' said Suzanne
Mitchell, FCCI public relations director. ''You have to figure out
what works best for you personally and what works best for your
department.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said some workers were happy to flee the 8-to-5 grind,
only to later want it back.
</P>
<P>
   ''They discover it really suited their needs,'' she said. ''Some
tried a flexible schedule, but decided a more disciplined one was
better for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Flexibility may take additional forms at FCCI. Under discussion
there are job sharing and telecommuting; the latter has been tried
on a limited basis.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of things on the drawing board, but a lot of
things get explored but not pursued,'' she said. ''We are not
satisfied that we are done.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Staff Leasing in Bradenton has found that the way to
the hearts of its approximately 700 employees is through their
stomachs.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, the public employer organization has
subsidized hot lunches. Last year, it stepped up the frequency of
the offering from three to five times weekly.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Hall, vice president of investor relations, said that up
to 150 workers daily partake in the meals, for which the company
pays half. The ritual builds morale by encouraging them to mingle
up and down the corporate ladder.
</P>
<P>
   ''It allows them the chance to interact with other departments,
to have lunch with the chief financial officer or the president of
the company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's on-site day care, subsidized lunches, flexible
schedules or on-site gyms, employers nationwide are realizing they
need to offer more than just a paycheck. Said Gordon Greenfield,
vice president of corporate development for Cheetah Technologies,
''In today's market, you can't really keep people if they don't
like where they work.''

A HOMEWORK REFRESHER COURSE FOR PARENTS
</HEADLINE>
  By ROSANNE ROSEN 
 c.1999 Rosanne Rosen 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that school bells are ringing again, it may be a good idea
for Mom and Dad to take a homework refresher course.
</P>
<P>
   Helping with homework is one of the most effective ways parents
can enhance a child's education, according to James Keogh, author
of ''The Secrets to Good Grades.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation for homework skills must be laid in the early
grades. By the time students reach high school, they should already
know how to manage their time and homework as there is a direct
link between well-completed homework and scholastic achievement at
the middle-and high-school level, says Harris Cooper, a psychology
professor at the University of Missouri at Columbia, and the author
of ''The Battle Over Homework,''
</P>
<P>
   With so much riding on homework, this is one refresher course
moms and dads need to pass with flying colors.
 &UR; Lesson 1: Becoming Your Child's Homework Coach &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ''I think if the parent takes on the responsibility of a coach,
kids will pick up on the attitude that homework is important,''
Keogh says.
</P>
<P>
   What homework coaches do is motivate, monitor and mentor. They
must set rules, establish routines, offer support, extend
encouragement, act as a role model, give assistance, provide
necessary materials and create an environment that is conducive for
learning.
 &UR; Lesson 2: Understanding the Importance of Homework &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The National Education Association says homework helps kids
learn, extends periods of learning, links home and school and
improves comprehension of material and raises grades. Assignments
provide an opportunity to review lessons presented in class, catch
up on missed concepts, test knowledge and practice important
skills.
</P>
<P>
   Studying outside of school teaches children time management,
independence and autonomous learning, self-discipline, persistence,
organization and self-reliance
 &UR; Lesson 3: Accepting the Role of Parental Participation &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Certainly it take takes time and patience after a tiring day,
but helping your children with their assignments sends a message
that they are important, as is their homework. It also provides a
time to show interest in what children are learning, ask them
questions and monitor their developmental level.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney S. Zentall, Ph.D., professor of special education and
psychological sciences at Purdue University and author of ''Seven
Steps to Homework Success,'' says you should enjoy younger
children's receptiveness to help. When kids get older, they view
parental involvement more like interference.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Zentall advises parents to ask junior high or
high-school students if they are amenable to parental help or if
they would prefer the help of a tutor, classmate or older sibling.
 &UR; Lesson 4: Learning How Much to Help &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Experts agree that helping children with homework doesn't mean
providing them with the answers. The goal of parental participation
is to develop an independent student who can separate from the
parent and feel that their work _ good or bad _ is their own,
Zentall says.
</P>
<P>
   ''Independence is a gradual process. Children rely upon parents,
but then must transfer that reliance to their peers, the librarian,
their teachers and things they can carry around with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, educators recommend parents ask leading questions,
make suggestions and break down complex problems into smaller
units.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most important roles for a parent, Cooper says, is
maintaining the child's interest, alleviating frustration and
demonstrating that they have learned something.
 &UR; Lesson 5: Offering Rewards or Giving Punishments &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   There is not one perfect solution to the homework battle many
parents engage in weekly. However, Zentall recommends coaxing
children into completing homework that is frequently tedious and
boring by offering incentives.
</P>
<P>
   ''Incentives are not bribes. They are things to look forward to
like breaks or favorite TV programs,'' she says. ''If you watch
children and see what they prefer to do when they come home from
school or ask them, you will find out what they prefer doing over
homework.''
</P>
<P>
   Professor Zentall conducted a study that revealed a list of
five-minute activities kids said they would rather do more than
their homework. Clean their room, walk the dog and talk to mom were
frequent answers.
</P>
<P>
   Providing incentives are more important when time spent on
homework increases.
 &UR; Lesson 6: Preparing the Proper Atmosphere &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The general rule for parents is to provide a work space where
children can readily focus on their homework. That doesn't
necessarily mean in a quiet room or at a desk, however.
</P>
<P>
   Zentall has researched the affects of distractions for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''There isn't one way to do homework,'' she says. '' Let the
child figure out how to work. Some work better in stimulating
environments some in more barren. A lot depends on the nature of
the task and individual differences. Some data shows children work
better with music in the background.''
</P>
<P>
   However, if homework done on the floor or in front of the TV is
full of errors, then it's time for the child to work in an
atmosphere with fewer distractions.
 &UR; Lesson 7: Practicing Modeling and Making Choices &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The most important part of this lesson is discovering how to
imbue your child with the value and pleasure of lifetime learning.
This could be as simple as taking an educational trip to a historic
site or as difficult as making critical choices.
</P>
<P>
   Use of time that reflects priorities is No. 1. Parents need to
stop over-scheduling children, Cooper says. They become bogged down
with so many activities they either run out of time for homework or
are too tired to do it. The Institute of Social Research at the
University of Michigan reports that American students spend more
time playing sports than doing homework.
</P>
<P>
   Second, a current trend of thought is parental modeling that
requires Mom and Dad set the example. For instance, parents should
read, write a letter or balance their checkbook and forego
television _ forbidden to their children _ while homework is in
progress.
 &UR; Lesson 8: Identifying Homework Overload or Trouble &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Although homework time has doubled for U.S. students since 1981,
it is still significantly less than in many other countries. The
National Education Association reports an average of 134 minutes a
week of homework for grade-school kids and 3 1/2 hours a week for
middle-school students. A first grader in Taiwan does seven times
as much homework as a first grader in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   So before parents jump to the conclusion that teachers are
piling on unreasonable amounts of work, do some research: Find out
the school policy on homework and pay attention if a child is
wasting time, goofing off or cramming a week's worth of assignments
into one night, Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   To determine whether children are dealing with overload or
learning problems, experts say don't hesitate to communicate with
teachers and administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Informed, participatory parents extend their power beyond the
help of an immediate homework lesson, Morgan said. They affect
their children's future accomplishments.

 &HT;    Obey Husted's First Law: Leave well enough alone
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I don't know how many computers we have here at the
newspaper _ literally thousands. There are two of them on my desk
at work, another at home. Sometimes I feel as if I belong to a big
dysfunctional family of semiconductors and processors.
</P>
<P>
   Like most dysfunctional families, this family of mine tries hard
to change things to make them better. But often we go about it in
the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   This morning, for instance, my work e-mail program didn't work.
Then, when I got ready to write this column, I discovered that the
software we use to produce this newspaper has been upgraded once
again. So nothing looked quite right, or worked quite right.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes I think that this dysfunctional family of mine needs
to sit down and have a good talk.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what I am gradually coming to believe about computers.
Lots of times, not just at work, we feel compelled to change things
just because we haven't changed them in a while. There's this
desperate feeling that if we just keep changing that we'll hit the
magic formula ... sort of like the monkeys eventually typing
Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   When a new version of Windows comes out, or a new edition of
some popular word processor or e-mail program, I get bombarded with
letters and calls from readers eager to make the change to the
newest version.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that all those computers are just tools. Unless you
are a computer hobbyist (and there's nothing wrong with that), the
only value of your computer is in the work it can do for you. The
less you notice the computer or the software, the better. If you
were building a barn, you wouldn't want to have to think about the
hammer or worry it needed an upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Now we get to Husted's First Law of Computing: If the computer
and the software that you have can do the work that you need it to
do, don't upgrade, don't add memory, don't do a danged thing. Your
computer will tell you when it needs an upgrade. You'll sit down
one day and actually need to do something important. And either the
computer or the software won't be up to the job. That's when you
need to fix things.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to Husted's Second Law of Computing for when
that happens: Know what you are going to do with your computer and
make your buying and upgrading decision based on that, not just by
browsing the ads and buying the most powerful computer available.
This means that if you really and truly are only going to log on to
the Web, do word processing and balance your checkbook, you don't
need a top-of-the-line super computer. For those tasks, you won't
even notice the speed difference except on your credit card
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how to put these two laws of computing to work.
</P>
<P>
   First, stop worrying so much about your computer. You don't sit
up nights wondering (or I hope you don't) if a new microwave oven
will change your life in some fundamental way. Think of all the
time you are going to save by not reading all those computer
magazines. And people will enjoy your company more at parties now
that you talk about stuff other than the latest processor from
Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Second, don't assume that every task in your life requires a
computer. Just because something can be done with a computer
doesn't mean that it should be done with a computer. I am reminded
of this each time I go to one of the big computer shows _ places
where the attendees have access to almost any technology available.
</P>
<P>
   Do you know what most of those high-tech hot shots use to take
notes? PalmPilots? Pocket organizers? Sub-notebook-sized computers?
</P>
<P>
   Nope. Most of them use scraps of paper and a pen. Maybe it's
time we all learned from the experts.
</P>
<P>
   MY MISTAKE
</P>
<P>
   OK. The Y2K bug bit me.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, I told you a way to change the date settings in
Windows so that it could handle four-digit dates. I said that, by
doing that, Windows would handle Y2K better.
</P>
<P>
   That's wrong. Doing what I told you does no harm. So don't
worry. But unfortunately, it does no good. It just changes the way
that Windows displays dates on the screen. It does not change the
way Windows handles dates internally. Luckily, there are few Y2K
problems with Windows anyway.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, you can get Y2K information about all of Microsoft's
products, not just Windows, from this Web site:

   ELIZABETH-DOLE (Anaheim, Calif.) _ Presidential candidate
Elizabeth Dole likes to tell the story of a young girl, maybe 10 or
11, who came up to her recently with a complaint: ``But I wanted to
be the first woman president,'' said the girl, worried that Dole
would steal her dream. But some political strategists and GOP
insiders say the young girl may have nothing to worry about. By
ROBERT SALLADAY.

<P>
   E-MAIL-SNOOPING (Sacramento, Calif.) _ California Gov. Gray
Davis is considering a bill that would outlaw the monitoring of
employee computer e-mail unless management first produces a written
policy everyone is told about. It would be the first such law in
the nation. By ROBERT SALLADAY.
</P>
<P>
   70S-RADICAL (Albany, N.Y.) _ Susan Saxe was the quiet kid who
penned her high school class poem in 1966 and went on to graduate
magna cum laude from Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass. But it
was not long after graduation that the anti-war activist was
arrested as a party to a bank robbery in which a Boston policeman
was killed. Today, the ex-convict's social action continues at a
Philadelphia Jewish organization. By EDWARD FITZPATRICK.

   CELL-TRANSPLANT (Saratoga Springs, N.Y.) _ A champagne cork

   GOOSENECK-LAMPS (Albany, N.Y.) _ The most common light for home
tasks or reading is the gooseneck lamp, named for its flexible
neck. Because they are so handy, they can be used in any room in
the house, from a home office to a nightstand. They are most
commonly used next to a favorite reading chair and have been a dorm
room or bedroom staple for students. By FRANCES INGRAHAM HEINS.

<P>
   AMERICANS-WORK (San Francisco) _ When the International Labor
Organization reported this month that Americans now work the
longest hours in the industrialized world, the statistics were a
little misleading. The real situation in the United States is even
more extreme. By DAVE MURPHY.
</P>
<P>
   SF-ECONOMY (San Francisco) _ The San Francisco Bay Area's
economic performance, including its outstanding labor and capital
productivity, remains the envy of the world, but the success is
seriously threatened by challenges that could cripple the ability
to sustain prosperity and preserve quality of life, a new study
reports. By GEORGE RAINE.

   TRAVEL (``t'' category)
</P>
<P>
   VERMONT-AUTUMN (West Dover, Vt.) _ The sign on Route 9 in
southern Vermont welcomes visitors who have driven into the
mountains, coming from Bennington to the Mount Snow-Haystack
Region, ``a four-season resort.'' But this time of year would not
be included in any seasonal category and it's my favorite of the
nonseasons, a mellow cider to July's lemonade. By JANE GOTTLIEB.
</P>
<P>
   MILLENNIUM-TRAVEL (Undated) _ The hype isn't working. With the
millennium less than 100 days away, travel agents and tourism
officials say there are still plenty of openings for hotels and
cruises. By DANIELLE FURFARO.
</P>
<P>
   LONDON-TUBE (London) _ On my recent visit to London I realized,
once again, that I still don't have the foggiest idea where
anything is. The problem is that the London I know isn't the London
of clock towers and double-decker buses and leafy green parks. The
London I know is an alternative, underground London, with its own
idiosyncratic coordinates and geography. The London I know is the
London of Harry Beck, who designed the map of the London tube. By
JOHN FLINN.

</P>
<P>
   BBN-WILLIE-McCOVEY (San Francisco) _ Willie McCovey is coming
home. Before an enthusiastic Candlestick crowd. As an employee of
his longtime team. As arguably the most popular Giant in San
Francisco franchise history. By JOHN SHEA.
</P>
<P>
   FBN-RAIDERS (Oakland, Calif.) _ Lance Johnstone was asked if he
could have seen any of his previous Raider teams committing five
turnovers and nine penalties and winning. It didn't take him long
to dismiss the notion as madness. By RAY RATTO.
</P>
<P>
   OUTDOORS-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Every hotel room in town has
been full on weekends for months at South Lake Tahoe, the roads
jammed, with some of the drivers certifiable lunatics. But from
Angora Peak, looking down across cobalt-blue Lake Tahoe, circled by
miles of forest and the granite mountain rim, it can seem as if you
are the only person on earth. Yet only a few miles separates these
two universes. By TOM STIENSTRA.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ The next millennium is less than
100 days away, and already it's a bore. The future is always a
disappointment when it arrives. In an age of mega-hype, the future
is a disappointment in advance. We know we're never getting world
peace, colonies on other planets, food in convenient squeeze tubes
or those personal jet packs we were promised long ago. By ROB
MORSE.
</P>
<P>
   ROSENFELD-COLUMN (Albany, N.Y.) _ The upcoming race between
Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rudolph Giuliani to represent New York
in the U.S. Senate is attracting as much interest outside New York
as in. By HARRY ROSENFELD.
</P>
<P>
   ROBISON-COLUMN (Austin, Texas) _ The recent lawsuit filed by the
Department of Justice against the tobacco industry has politics
written all over it, coming, as it did, more than halfway through
President Clinton's last term and on the heels of tobacco's
multibillion-dollar settlements of similar state suits seeking
recovery of tax dollars spent on smoking-related health care. By
CLAY ROBISON.

   &UR; A FEEDING FRENZY MADE FOR CONSUMERS &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (1,100 words) &QL; 
 &UR; By SAUL HANSELL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Internet companies and their investors are desperate to get big
fast _ so much so that they are almost willing to bribe people to
shop with them. As a result, the savvy cyberconsumer can find sites
selling all sorts of items. You name it, someone has started a Web
site to sell it: Autoweb, Furniture.com, Pets.com, and the list
goes on. What's the allure? Which Internet retailers are making
money? And which aren't?

<P>
   E-commerce has revolutionized the selling of books, compact

software _ commodities shoppers don't need to squeeze and prod to
get a handle on. But will the on-line bazaar work for everyday
survival? In an attempt to find out, writer Matt Rich sealed
himself into an E-cave. For five days, he ordered all sustenance
and entertainment from the Net. He survived, but will he ever be
the same? Here, he offers his diary.

<P>
   Where can an E-business turn for a model of how to make money on
the Web? To the entrepreneurs who were the first to make E-commerce
pay and whose businesses are still the most profitable sector of
the Internet: the on-line pornographers. Pornography sites have
pioneered technical and marketing developments that are at the
heart of the business plans of many enterprises that would not be
caught dead on the same server. In a sidebar titled ``Keeping It
Out of Your House,'' Kilgannon lists the software filters for
blocking pornography from personal computers.

   There are Hollywood agents, literary agents, real-estate agents
and travel agents. Now meet Internet agents. ``Intelligent agent''
programs and their kin, ``shopping bots,'' are among the hottest

</P>
<P>
   Last September, Oliver Samwer, 26, and his 24-year-old brother
Alexander, packed their bags to join their 28-year-old brother,
Marc, as interns in Silicon Valley. There they came across Ebay,
the on-line auction site, and thought they saw a niche for a
similar site in Germany. They quit their internships, recruited
three college pals and headed to Germany in January to start their
own auction site on the Ebay model, which they called Alando.de. On
March 1, the site went on-line. Goldman, Sachs called on May 17 to
say that Ebay was interested. On May 30, the six 20-somethings sold
Alando.de to Ebay for $43 million. This is their story.

   Singer David Bowie is the most well-known artist trying to sell

Def Leppard recently began new albums with on-line previews

   Kevin Lacey, a 41-year-old architect, was no gambler. He had
never even been to Las Vegas, Nev. But when he saw a magazine
advertisement about playing blackjack on the Internet, he was
intrigued. That was three years ago. Now Lacey is more than $60,000
in debt. And he is not alone. Hundreds of ``cybercasinos'' have
come on-line since 1995, giving almost anyone with a computer and
credit card the chance to gamble. In this feature, writer Dirk

   &UR; DELUXE DILEMMA: TO SELL GLOBALLY OR SELL HAUGHTILY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (1,000 words) &QL; 
 &UR; By LESLIE KAUFMAN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, luxury vendors _ the Guccis and Pradas of the
world _ have only tiptoed into cyberspace. Why? On-line selling is
seen as a little too low rent, and a large part of the cost of any
luxury item is its exclusive image. (A Prada bag costs $450 because
one can get it in only a few stores. The bag would lose some of its
cachet if it were made available on-line.) But big-spenders
shouldn't despair: The lures for luxury's prime-time players to the
join the Web are too great to ignore. For example, technology is
quickly improving, and the average Web user has twice the income of
the average American.

   Internet companies and their investors are desperate to get big
fast _ so much so that they are almost willing to bribe people to
shop with them. As a result, the savvy cyberconsumer can find sites
selling all sorts of items. You name it, someone has started a Web
site to sell it: Autoweb, Furniture.com, Pets.com, and the list
goes on. What's the allure? Which Internet retailers are making
money? And which aren't?

   E-commerce has revolutionized the selling of books, compact

software _ commodities shoppers don't need to squeeze and prod to
get a handle on. But will the on-line bazaar work for everyday
survival? In an attempt to find out, writer Matt Rich sealed
himself into an E-cave. For five days, he ordered all sustenance
and entertainment from the Net. He survived, but will he ever be

   Where can an E-business turn for a model of how to make money on
the Web? To the entrepreneurs who were the first to make E-commerce
pay and whose businesses are still the most profitable sector of
the Internet: the on-line pornographers. Pornography sites have
pioneered technical and marketing developments that are at the
heart of the business plans of many enterprises that would not be
caught dead on the same server. In a sidebar titled ``Keeping It
Out of Your House,'' Kilgannon lists the software filters for
blocking pornography from personal computers.

   There are Hollywood agents, literary agents, real-estate agents
and travel agents. Now meet Internet agents. ``Intelligent agent''
programs and their kin, ``shopping bots,'' are among the hottest
new areas of electronic commerce. They hold out the promise of
making shopping on the Internet better not just by finding lower
prices but matching products to the needs and tastes of individual
consumers.

   Last September, Oliver Samwer, 26, and his 24-year-old brother
Alexander, packed their bags to join their 28-year-old brother,
Marc, as interns in Silicon Valley. There they came across Ebay,
the on-line auction site, and thought they saw a niche for a
similar site in Germany. They quit their internships, recruited
three college pals and headed to Germany in January to start their
own auction site on the Ebay model, which they called Alando.de. On
March 1, the site went on-line. Goldman, Sachs called on May 17 to
say that Ebay was interested. On May 30, the six 20-somethings sold
Alando.de to Ebay for $43 million. This is their story.

   Singer David Bowie is the most well-known artist trying to sell
a full-length recording in a download format providing copyright
protection. He is one of many artists who are using the Internet to
distribute audio in hopes of establishing a following, reviving a
career or promoting new work. The Red Hot Chili Peppers, Creed and
Def Leppard recently began new albums with on-line previews
designed to build anticipation before their release dates. As Chuck
D of the rap group Public Enemy said in a recent interview: ``The
Internet happened to be a dog. You either pet the dog, or let the
dog bite your leg.'' Sue Cummings reports.

   Kevin Lacey, a 41-year-old architect, was no gambler. He had
never even been to Las Vegas, Nev. But when he saw a magazine
advertisement about playing blackjack on the Internet, he was
intrigued. That was three years ago. Now Lacey is more than $60,000
in debt. And he is not alone. Hundreds of ``cybercasinos'' have
come on-line since 1995, giving almost anyone with a computer and
credit card the chance to gamble. In this feature, writer Dirk
Johnson reports on the murky world of cybergambling.

<P>
   At the moment, luxury vendors _ the Guccis and Pradas of the
world _ have only tiptoed into cyberspace. Why? On-line selling is
seen as a little too low rent, and a large part of the cost of any
luxury item is its exclusive image. (A Prada bag costs $450 because
one can get it in only a few stores. The bag would lose some of its
cachet if it were made available on-line.) But big-spenders
shouldn't despair: The lures for luxury's prime-time players to the
join the Web are too great to ignore. For example, technology is
quickly improving, and the average Web user has twice the income of
the average American.

   Where can an E-business turn for a model of how to make money on
the Web? To the entrepreneurs who were the first to make E-commerce
pay and whose businesses are still the most profitable sector of
the Internet: the on-line pornographers. Pornography sites have
pioneered technical and marketing developments that are at the
heart of the business plans of many enterprises that would not be
caught dead on the same server. In a sidebar titled ``Keeping It
Out of Your House,'' Kilgannon lists the software filters for
blocking pornography from personal computers.

   There are Hollywood agents, literary agents, real-estate agents
and travel agents. Now meet Internet agents. ``Intelligent agent''
programs and their kin, ``shopping bots,'' are among the hottest
new areas of electronic commerce. They hold out the promise of
making shopping on the Internet better not just by finding lower
prices but matching products to the needs and tastes of individual
consumers.

   Last September, Oliver Samwer, 26, and his 24-year-old brother
Alexander, packed their bags to join their 28-year-old brother,
Marc, as interns in Silicon Valley. There they came across Ebay,
the on-line auction site, and thought they saw a niche for a
similar site in Germany. They quit their internships, recruited
three college pals and headed to Germany in January to start their
own auction site on the Ebay model, which they called Alando.de. On
March 1, the site went on-line. Goldman, Sachs called on May 17 to
say that Ebay was interested. On May 30, the six 20-somethings sold
Alando.de to Ebay for $43 million. This is their story.

   Singer David Bowie is the most well-known artist trying to sell
a full-length recording in a download format providing copyright
protection. He is one of many artists who are using the Internet to
distribute audio in hopes of establishing a following, reviving a
career or promoting new work. The Red Hot Chili Peppers, Creed and
Def Leppard recently began new albums with on-line previews
designed to build anticipation before their release dates. As Chuck
D of the rap group Public Enemy said in a recent interview: ``The
Internet happened to be a dog. You either pet the dog, or let the
dog bite your leg.'' Sue Cummings reports.

<P>
   Kevin Lacey, a 41-year-old architect, was no gambler. He had
never even been to Las Vegas, Nev. But when he saw a magazine
advertisement about playing blackjack on the Internet, he was
intrigued. That was three years ago. Now Lacey is more than $60,000
in debt. And he is not alone. Hundreds of ``cybercasinos'' have
come on-line since 1995, giving almost anyone with a computer and
credit card the chance to gamble. In this feature, writer Dirk
Johnson reports on the murky world of cybergambling.

</P>
<P>
   At the moment, luxury vendors _ the Guccis and Pradas of the
world _ have only tiptoed into cyberspace. Why? On-line selling is
seen as a little too low rent, and a large part of the cost of any
luxury item is its exclusive image. (A Prada bag costs $450 because
one can get it in only a few stores. The bag would lose some of its
cachet if it were made available on-line.) But big-spenders
shouldn't despair: The lures for luxury's prime-time players to the
join the Web are too great to ignore. For example, technology is
quickly improving, and the average Web user has twice the income of
the average American.

   Internet companies and their investors are desperate to get big
fast _ so much so that they are almost willing to bribe people to
shop with them. As a result, the savvy cyberconsumer can find sites
selling all sorts of items. You name it, someone has started a Web
site to sell it: Autoweb, Furniture.com, Pets.com, and the list
goes on. What's the allure? Which Internet retailers are making
money? And which aren't?

   Singer David Bowie is the most well-known artist trying to sell
a full-length recording in a download format providing copyright
protection. He is one of many artists who are using the Internet to
distribute audio in hopes of establishing a following, reviving a
career or promoting new work. The Red Hot Chili Peppers, Creed and
Def Leppard recently began new albums with on-line previews
designed to build anticipation before their release dates. As Chuck
D of the rap group Public Enemy said in a recent interview: ``The
Internet happened to be a dog. You either pet the dog, or let the
dog bite your leg.'' Sue Cummings reports.

<P>
   Kevin Lacey, a 41-year-old architect, was no gambler. He had
never even been to Las Vegas, Nev. But when he saw a magazine
advertisement about playing blackjack on the Internet, he was
intrigued. That was three years ago. Now Lacey is more than $60,000
in debt. And he is not alone. Hundreds of ``cybercasinos'' have
come on-line since 1995, giving almost anyone with a computer and
credit card the chance to gamble. In this feature, writer Dirk
Johnson reports on the murky world of cybergambling.

   &UR; DELUXE DILEMMA: TO SELL GLOBALLY OR SELL HAUGHTILY &LR;  &QL;

 &UR; By LESLIE KAUFMAN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, luxury vendors _ the Guccis and Pradas of the
world _ have only tiptoed into cyberspace. Why? On-line selling is
seen as a little too low rent, and a large part of the cost of any
luxury item is its exclusive image. (A Prada bag costs $450 because
one can get it in only a few stores. The bag would lose some of its
cachet if it were made available on-line.) But big-spenders
shouldn't despair: The lures for luxury's prime-time players to the
join the Web are too great to ignore. For example, technology is
quickly improving, and the average Web user has twice the income of
the average American.

<P>
   Internet companies and their investors are desperate to get big
fast _ so much so that they are almost willing to bribe people to
shop with them. As a result, the savvy cyberconsumer can find sites
selling all sorts of items. You name it, someone has started a Web
site to sell it: Autoweb, Furniture.com, Pets.com, and the list
goes on. What's the allure? Which Internet retailers are making
money? And which aren't?

   E-commerce has revolutionized the selling of books, compact

software _ commodities shoppers don't need to squeeze and prod to
get a handle on. But will the on-line bazaar work for everyday
survival? In an attempt to find out, writer Matt Rich sealed
himself into an E-cave. For five days, he ordered all sustenance
and entertainment from the Net. He survived, but will he ever be
the same? Here, he offers his diary.

   Where can an E-business turn for a model of how to make money on
the Web? To the entrepreneurs who were the first to make E-commerce
pay and whose businesses are still the most profitable sector of
the Internet: the on-line pornographers. Pornography sites have
pioneered technical and marketing developments that are at the
heart of the business plans of many enterprises that would not be
caught dead on the same server. In a sidebar titled ``Keeping It
Out of Your House,'' Kilgannon lists the software filters for
blocking pornography from personal computers.

   There are Hollywood agents, literary agents, real-estate agents
and travel agents. Now meet Internet agents. ``Intelligent agent''
programs and their kin, ``shopping bots,'' are among the hottest
new areas of electronic commerce. They hold out the promise of
making shopping on the Internet better not just by finding lower
prices but matching products to the needs and tastes of individual
consumers.

Marc, as interns in Silicon Valley. There they came across Ebay,
the on-line auction site, and thought they saw a niche for a

three college pals and headed to Germany in January to start their

   At the moment, luxury vendors _ the Guccis and Pradas of the
world _ have only tiptoed into cyberspace. Why? On-line selling is
seen as a little too low rent, and a large part of the cost of any
luxury item is its exclusive image. (A Prada bag costs $450 because
one can get it in only a few stores. The bag would lose some of its
cachet if it were made available on-line.) But big-spenders
shouldn't despair: The lures for luxury's prime-time players to the
join the Web are too great to ignore. For example, technology is
quickly improving, and the average Web user has twice the income of
the average American.

 &UR; By SAUL HANSELL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Internet companies and their investors are desperate to get big
fast _ so much so that they are almost willing to bribe people to
shop with them. As a result, the savvy cyberconsumer can find sites
selling all sorts of items. You name it, someone has started a Web
site to sell it: Autoweb, Furniture.com, Pets.com, and the list
goes on. What's the allure? Which Internet retailers are making
money? And which aren't?

   E-commerce has revolutionized the selling of books, compact
disks, travel and financial services and computer hardware and
software _ commodities shoppers don't need to squeeze and prod to
get a handle on. But will the on-line bazaar work for everyday
survival? In an attempt to find out, writer Matt Rich sealed
himself into an E-cave. For five days, he ordered all sustenance
and entertainment from the Net. He survived, but will he ever be
the same? Here, he offers his diary.

   Where can an E-business turn for a model of how to make money on
the Web? To the entrepreneurs who were the first to make E-commerce
pay and whose businesses are still the most profitable sector of
the Internet: the on-line pornographers. Pornography sites have
pioneered technical and marketing developments that are at the
heart of the business plans of many enterprises that would not be
caught dead on the same server. In a sidebar titled ``Keeping It
Out of Your House,'' Kilgannon lists the software filters for
blocking pornography from personal computers.

   Last September, Oliver Samwer, 26, and his 24-year-old brother
Alexander, packed their bags to join their 28-year-old brother,
Marc, as interns in Silicon Valley. There they came across Ebay,
the on-line auction site, and thought they saw a niche for a
similar site in Germany. They quit their internships, recruited
three college pals and headed to Germany in January to start their
own auction site on the Ebay model, which they called Alando.de. On
March 1, the site went on-line. Goldman, Sachs called on May 17 to
say that Ebay was interested. On May 30, the six 20-somethings sold
Alando.de to Ebay for $43 million. This is their story.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Hollywood agents, literary agents, real-estate agents, travel
agents _ now meet Internet agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intelligent agent'' programs and their kin, ``shopping bots,''
are among the hottest new areas of electronic commerce. They hold
out the promise of making shopping on the Internet better not just
by finding lower prices but by matching products to the needs and
tastes of individual consumers.
</P>
<P>
   While the term ``agent'' suggests a trustworthy representative
dispatched into the wilds of cyberspace bazaars, bot conveys the
image of a combative R2D2 scooting through the marketplace of some
distant planet pricing used space cruisers.
</P>
<P>
   The reality behind the names is different: Agents and bots are
programs, routines, algorithms _ strings of complicated
mathematical equations that are used to find and compare patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Zillman of Botspot, an agency that tracks software
agents, predicts that in five years, bots will be involved in most
on-line shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Electronic word of mouth,'' is the phrase that Prof. Pattie
Maes of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media
Laboratory uses to describe what some software agents bring to the
party.
</P>
<P>
   A pioneer in the field of software agents, Professor Maes has
become one of the most visible and articulate proponents of this
new type of program, which lets users learn by comparing their
preferences with those of what she calls their ``taste mates.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a real-estate agent or travel agent, a software shopping
agent has responsibility for finding products and prices, Professor
Maes said. One of the agent's responsibilities is to match the
user's preferences. Software agents take initiative, learn from the
habits of their clients and adapt to the market.
</P>
<P>
   At the MIT Media Laboratory, Professor Maes founded and directs
the Software Agents Group and holds the Sony Corporation Career
Development Chair. Two of her many projects have led to commercial
spinoffs that represent the two leading types of shopping bots.
</P>
<P>
   The first was Firefly, introduced in 1995, which helps make
individual recommendations for taste-based products like compact
disks, books and films. The other is Frictionless, which went into
service in August on the Lycos portal and other Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Frictionless is designed to shop for the best price and service
on less-frequently bought products, like cars or camcorders.
</P>
<P>
   Firefly is Professor Maes' best-known spinoff. It was one of the
first shopping bots to use intelligent agents and collaborative
filtering.
</P>
<P>
   Developed in the early 1990s, Firefly's software began as a site
called Helpful On-Line Music Recommendations, or HOMR, where users
could receive guidance in finding music recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Users rated a series of CDs to create individual profiles, which
were compared with profiles of other users with similar tastes to
generate suggestions for music the user might enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the HOMR project was spun off and incorporated first as
Agents, then under the friendlier name Firefly. Other sites,
including Reel.com, adopted similar techniques to help people
choose films. Some licensed the software from Firefly.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in April 1998, Firefly was sold to Microsoft, guaranteeing
its influence across one of the most powerful sets of on-line
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Firefly and other collaborative filtering systems take advantage
of the knowledge and tastes of customers. Sometimes the user fills
in a form on-line. At other times, the agent learns from a person's
buying or browsing patterns, as tracked by software from companies
like Doubleclick.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a college student might be presented only with the
restaurants that fit his or her budget; a diner on a
low-cholesterol diet might get a different list. Such
recommendation options, including those produced by Firefly's
competitor, Net Advantage for Barnesandnoble.com, are probably the
most familiar of the new bots.
</P>
<P>
   ``This type of recommendation technology only works for domains
where people buy on a regular basis,'' Professor Maes said. ``It's
great for books or music, but not, say, for a car, which you might
buy only every four to eight years.''
</P>
<P>
   For those kinds of products, a different kind of agent
technology, like Frictionless, works better.
</P>
<P>
   Frictionless also grew from Professor Maes' work at the MIT
Media Laboratory. It searches on-line shopping sites for products
with specific features at the best price.
</P>
<P>
   For example, on Frictionless, someone interested in buying a
laptop computer chooses among a set of user profiles, with names
that include ``road warrior,'' ``budget shopper'' and
``telecommuter.'' Each profile provides a list of product features,
among them weight, speed and memory, as well as information on the
vendor relating to warranty, availability and delivery.
</P>
<P>
   To further personalize the search, the user can rely on the
preset profile or edit it, rating factors like screen size and
product warranty on a scale of ``not important'' to ``very
important.''
</P>
<P>
   The greatest concern to users is privacy.
</P>
<P>
   `This is a major issue that deserves public discussion,''
Professor Maes said. The more an agent knows about you, the more
useful it can be.
</P>
<P>
   But while some shopping-bot companies promise not to sell
information to other companies, others give away their software and
plan to make money from selling the information they gather on
shopping patterns.
</P>
<P>
   A survey by Jupiter Communications, an industry tracking
company, suggested that more than 60 percent of shoppers remained
wary of giving information to an on-line site.
</P>
<P>
   Firefly hired an accounting firm to certify its privacy
practices, and Maes was an early backer of proposed industry
standards for privacy. The so-called Platform for Privacy
Preferences protocols are under discussion by the nonprofit World
Wide Web Consortium and enjoy the support of Microsoft, MCI
Worldcom, AT&AMP;T, IBM, Netscape, Oracle and other companies.
</P>
<P>
   But even if these standards _ which involve encrypting
information and obtaining permission from consumers to transfer
personal information _ become accepted, on-line shoppers may not
feel comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 18, just two days after Frictionless went on-line,
Firefly's site vanished, swallowed by Microsoft's Passport shopping
site, which will begin this fall. Many of Firefly's users were
dismayed despite Microsoft's assurances that privacy and other
policies would remain in place.
</P>
<P>
   Trust is vital to making software agents work well.
</P>
<P>
   One of Professor Maes' other projects at MIT seeks to bring
together people who have not met but have similar interests. The
program uses a survey of potentially sensitive information, like
people's mail, their personal files or lists of their interests.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to imagine how the program might be useful to link
scientists around the world for academic conferences, but its
working name suggests an even more dramatic matchmaking
possibility: It is called Yenta.

<P>
   It is a Sunday night, and I have just sealed myself into an
E-cave. For the next five days, I will order all sustenance and
entertainment from the Net. I will hunker down in a bachelor pad in
Palo Alto, Calif., armed with credit card and mouse.
</P>
<P>
   I click my way to the checkout aisle of Webvan, an on-line
grover, to schedule a delivery time. Tomorrow morning would be
great. Then, crisis. I'm told that deliveries are first come, first
served. Webvan can deliver the same day, but the next available
appointment is Wednesday night. By then I could walk to the nearest
market and back _ on stilts.
</P>
<P>
   Will the on-line bazaar work for everyday survival, and as a
means for daily upkeep of heart, soul, body, mind and, foremost,
stomach?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MONDAY: LEARNING TO ORDER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In his quest for food, primitive man faced the woolly mammoth. I
face slothlike delivery schedules. Undaunted by my Webvan
disappointment, I set out on Monday morning to hunt and gather
21st-century style.
</P>
<P>
   A Web search turns up 69 sites offering ``grocery delivery,''
including Groceronline, Netgrocer and Electrolley. I pop into and
register at several sites, then head down the virtual aisles.
</P>
<P>
   But each time I go to check out, I learn delivery is either not
available in my area or will take three to 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   By noon, I change strategies. I search on ``food delivery, Palo
Alto'' and am led to Waiters.com, a service that takes on-line
orders for local restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   At one spot I know, the Good Earth, I point and click through
the menu. But I make rookie E-commerce errors, neglecting, for
example, to complete registration forms.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later my $32 order arrives. Hungry and having not seen
another human being in nearly 24 hours, I practically hug Louis,
the Waiters.com driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were you,'' he says, ``I would have ordered over the
phone. It's easier.''
</P>
<P>
   If he only knew. All day, I have battled not just delivery
schedules but a debilitating injury. I have hurt my left pinkie. I
jammed it in a recent basketball game, and it's swollen and purple,
like a mini-eggplant.
</P>
<P>
   I divine an answer: the cybermedic. A search for ``medical
advice'' returns the names of dozens of doctors who offer virtual
consultations. I even find a specialist, a sports orthopedist named
Stuart Zeman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people dread going to the doctor,'' his site says. ``It
can be expensive, inconvenient and stressful.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Zeman's alternative is an E-mail consultation for 10 bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is he inexpensive, he's also concise. You get one
paragraph to describe your malady, and the virtual physician's
response runs only a few lines. (Somewhere, an HMO executive is
taking copious notes.)
</P>
<P>
   And so by the end of the day, I have scored several small
E-commerce victories, including the fact that late in the
afternoon, I have discovered an on-line grocer called Peapod. I
arrange for a Tuesday delivery.
</P>
<P>
   When I go to bed, I have fed my brain with food, and I have
tended to my corpus with medical advice. Tomorrow, feeling more
seasoned in the ways of E-commerce, I will feed my soul. I will buy
a golf course.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TUESDAY: LIVING ROOM IS PERFECT FOR SINKING A 9-FOOTER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, not an entire golf course, but at least an indoor putting
green. This will permit me to test my E-commerce mettle, alleviate
the boredom that accompanies an on-line, in-house lifestyle and
address one of life's pressing concerns, improving my golf game.
</P>
<P>
   My search-engine request on Yahoo spits out nearly 40 possible
merchants, with names like Eagle Putting Greens and Chip-n-Putt.
</P>
<P>
   I settle on a shop called Big Moss Golf. This is partly because
it feels like a local store and partly because it promises to bring
my handicap out of the stratosphere. And partly because it has a
toll-free number for customer service, and I'm starting to get a
little lonely in the E-cave.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll have to work that out yourself,'' Tony Terisco says.
He's the owner of Big Moss Golf who sells me on the Big Moss
Original, a $159, nine-foot-long piece of carpet simulated to feel
like grass with a golf hole at one end.
</P>
<P>
   It dawns on me that it may be even more instructive to play
actual golf. But I'm in no mood to quibble. I pay an extra $30 for
overnight delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Just then, I receive a house call from my on-line doctor, Stuart
Zeman. ``You must get an X-ray,'' he prescribes in no uncertain
terms.
</P>
<P>
   Leave the house? Never!
</P>
<P>
   I decide to seek a second opinion. I fire off an E-mail to Dr.
Michele Moore, who runs a site called www.askyour familydoc.com.
She will give me a virtual bedside counsel for $25.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WEDNESDAY: AN ON-LINE WARRIOR VICTORIOUS IN BATTLE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Help. Send Prozac. Otherwise, I may torture and kill my
neighbor, who has been practicing the piano for hours.
</P>
<P>
   But I will combat her, E-commerce style. My weapons are earplugs
and aspirin. My destination is pharmaceutical sites. I settle on
Planetrx.com and Drugstore.com.
</P>
<P>
   I register at each site and check their delivery schedules. Then
I engage in a bit of hard-core price comparison. I open two browser
windows and compare the sites side by side, checking response time,
prices and product information.
</P>
<P>
   The arrows favor Planetrx. Minutes later, I ``walk out'' with
earplugs and Advil, opting for overnight delivery for an additional
$10. While I'm at it, I check out the stores' aisles of bandage
tape for my injured digit. Drugstore.com offers eight pages of
athletic tape and gauze products.
</P>
<P>
   This is when I realize I've E-volved into a wily E-commerce
veteran. I'm in and out of the drugstores in 10 minutes, far less
than it would have taken to drive to a pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
   Flush with success, I endeavor an E-commerce challenge with an
Olympic degree of difficulty. I'm going to use my modem to get my
cat to stop throwing up. I've tried the normal remedies, like
giving her soft foods and beer, but frankly, I inherited the cat
from an ex-girlfriend and I never could figure her out _ the cat, I
mean.
</P>
<P>
   I find a veterinarian to consult by E-mail. But then I ascend
further, pinpointing a service that in and of itself may illustrate
just how far this new commerce medium has come: Kay Cox, on-line
pet psychiatrist, www.getnet.com/petcouns/.
</P>
<P>
   Cox, a self-proclaimed ``pet therapist and talent scout,''
offers on-line consultation for $40 an hour. I send her an
electronic missive and assure the cat it will be OK.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, my own psychological salve has arrived _ my putting
green. John Tuggle, the UPS deliveryman, takes one look at me and
says, ``I think you need to get out of the house and go to the
shopping mall.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THURSDAY: THE MOMENT OF TRUTH _ SEARCHING FOR LOVE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They'' say it's hard to meet good people these days. ``They''
say it's tough to find a soul mate amid the cacophony of modern
life.
</P>
<P>
   Well, they've never met Kitten664.
</P>
<P>
   This is the woman I am paired up with by Matchmaker.com. The
on-line service concluded we may constitute a love connection by
comparing our answers to about 50 questions like personal hobbies,
income, height and weight and reading habits. Kitten664 and I
matched on 54 percent of our answers.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, we're both 5 feet 8 inches tall and weigh 160 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   It's true: I soon realize that among the criteria the company
matches are our height and weight, which doesn't seem like a
quality that either sex typically wants in a mate.
</P>
<P>
   In a second attempt at a dating service, I fill out a
questionnaire on a site that promises to help me find my soul mate.
But when I finish, it takes me to an advertisement for free,
on-line pornography.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think this is a site I'd like to bring home to my
mother.
</P>
<P>
   But there is good news on my penultimate day in the E-cave. The
swelling in my pinkie has gone down. This is partly thanks to
E-mail from Dr. Moore, who advocates icing and elevating the
finger.
</P>
<P>
   Also, I've ordered lunch with ease from Waiters.com _ without
even needing to register because my registration is already on
file.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the cat has quit vomiting.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FRIDAY: A LITTLE WISDOM GLEANED FROM LIVING LIFE ON-LINE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just when I am feeling as if I may never need the outside world
again, fate intervenes. My office calls and tells me I must go on
an urgent assignment. My week in the E-cave is cut short.
</P>
<P>
   I reflect on the four days gone by. I have discovered that with
a little practice and experience, the Net can yield some powerful
dividends. Product information and diversity are unparalleled.
Plus, there is extraordinary capacity to compare prices.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the downside. The on-line experience can be an
isolating one. Some very important sense of community develops from
shopping in the flesh, despite the hassles of driving, parking,
fighting crowds and arguing whether you really have 10 or 11 items
in the express lane.
</P>
<P>
   There are other bugs, too. Like sometimes an E-commerce site
just freezes up. It's like walking up to a sales clerk in a store,
asking a question, then having him glower at you before turning
around and walking away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I'm talking to you,'' I shouted at one point during the
week to a frozen site.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, I conclude there are two basic and unassailable
tenets of the E-commerce life: (1) you can order anything under the
sun over the Net _ and in greater selection than in any other
single venue on the planet, and (2) plan ahead, or you'll starve to
death.

 By COREY KILGANNON 
 c.1999 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Where can an E-business struggling to fend off rising
competition turn for a model of how to make money on the Web? To
the entrepreneurs who were the first to make E-commerce pay and
whose businesses are still the most profitable sector of the
Internet: the on-line pornographers.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does the cyberskin game hold lessons for all sorts of
on-line businesses, experts say, but pornography sites have
pioneered technical and marketing developments that are at the
heart of the business plans of many enterprises that would not be
caught dead on the same server.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of lessons to be had from the on-line porn's
success on the Web,'' said David Zinman, the vice president for
marketing of Adknowledge of Palo Alto, Calif., which charges site
owners to gauge how well their on-line advertisements generate
leads and sales.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Tiarra, whose on-line company, the Tiarra Corporation,
creates advertisements and strategies for sex-oriented Web sites,
said that compared with his clients and their competitors, ``the
nonadult side of the Web has always been a year behind the curve in
marketing strategies.''
</P>
<P>
   This innovative streak has been shaped by two realities: Unlike
many other Web businesses, sex sites have a product that people are
willing to pay for but that almost anyone can produce.
</P>
<P>
   There would be no sex sites if sex did not sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike major mainstream companies, sex sites had no off-line
revenue stream,'' said Mr. Tiarra, who is also president of United
Adult Sites, a trade organization of 500 on-line sex companies.
``You have to make it on your own.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on, visiting sex sites meant long downloads and slow video
clips, but operators found ways to transmit large pictures despite
narrow bandwidths.
</P>
<P>
   As the Internet became awash with sex sites, the operators
scrambled to develop a way to use existing on-line technology to
get pictures to Web surfers for the few moments they would land on
a site.
</P>
<P>
   With income essentially based on speed of content flow, Web site
designers began writing programs that tweaked technology to make
pages and photos load more quickly to grab their share of the
market.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting sites were not always coherent and flowing, but
they delivered the product quickly, and that drew browsers and kept
them from skipping to the next sex site.
</P>
<P>
   Creators of sex sites used tips and tricks in writing Web page
scripts so that sexy selling points loaded onto the screen first
before less appetizing elements, like sign-up fees.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Web's sex sites make money by charging for entry to
a video gallery, usually by a membership bought with a credit card.
Many also carry paid advertisements for larger sites. Free sites
profit by carrying links to other sites, which pay fractions of a
cent each time a customer clicks through.
</P>
<P>
   With profits tied to traffic on the site, the battle for the
most clicks was on. Some site operators designed tricks to lure
casual surfers to accidentally visit sex sites. Some devised loops
to repeatedly click onto sites, including manipulation of the back
key to keep reloading a page.
</P>
<P>
   Stealth redirection techniques cropped up, including writing
programs to create pop-up browsers that emerged as users left
sites, creating a ``no exit'' barrage of windows and prompts. Web
sites began feeding encoded key words for sites unrelated to sex
into search engines, drawing unsuspecting browsers and causing
pop-up advertisements to appear when certain key words were
entered.
</P>
<P>
   They bought rights to commonly used names of Web sites with
altered suffixes. For example, browsers seeking the Presidential
Web site at www.Whitehouse.gov/ got a sex site if, by mistake, they
typed in www.Whitehouse.com.
</P>
<P>
   Some sites began requesting credit card information as proof of
age for ``free trials,'' adding in fine print that membership
charges automatically would begin afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Tiarra said, mainstream Web site owners were more
complacent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were coming into this saying, `Is this going to work?'''
he said. ``We came in saying, `How am I going to make enough money
to quit my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, mainstream companies are hiring designers of sex
sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're looking for successful strategies, so they're going to
get the guys who had the most competitors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Duvall, who assesses sex-oriented sites, said there was a
limit to what mainstream sites could copy from the pornographic
ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with copying porn sites is that sex is the
compelling content, and you can never really compete with that,''
Duvall said.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the field's ferocious rivalry, sex sites offer
lessons in the benefits of cooperation, too, said Duvall, a former
newspaper advertising saleswoman who two years ago used $500 and an
old Power Mac to set up her own Web site, Jane's 'Net Sex Guide,
which reviews and rates sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it co-opetition, and you don't see it much on the
nonadult sites,'' she said. ``Even a link trade is a big deal.
You're only sending away a user that is leaving anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream companies using click-through referrals should
research the sex-site industry to learn how to avoid getting
cheated, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller on-line pornography sites formed larger networks
offering comprehensive memberships and then splitting the profits _
resembling America Online's more recent decision to develop an
electronic network that would allow members to shop at many retail
Web sites with one credit account.
</P>
<P>
   They also formed large, free supersites, where each company
would post its own click-through banner.
</P>
<P>
   Another example of the strategy of cross-linking or
link-swapping was the formation of referral rings, networks in
which sites refer customers to one another.
</P>
<P>
   Sophisticated tracking systems were then designed to count the
referrals that became paying customers, so sites could reward one
another with a percentage of the sign-up fee. This practice has
been adopted by many mainstream sites, like Amazon.com and
Beyond.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``The on-line porn industry has driven Web technology just as it
has with all new media,'' said Seth Warshavsky, the chief executive
of the Internet Entertainment Group, a sex-oriented on-line company
based in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The adult industry entrepreneurs have been a lot more
aggressive developing marketing strategies because they see a
direct return on everything they put out,'' he said. ``They're all
players willing to take a risk to develop new marketing strategies,
and only now are a lot of the mainstream on-line companies applying
those concepts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the porn industry, you have a tremendous demand for the
material product,'' Zinman said. ``Nonadult industry has to acquire
the kind of information that consumers will want to pay for to make
a profitable business model. Until then, profitable mainstream Web
sites will continue to be an oxymoron.''
</P>
<P>
   ----
 &UR; SIDEBAR: KEEPING IT OUT OF YOUR HOUSE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the United States Supreme Court overturned a 1997 Federal
law that prohibited the dissemination of sexually explicit material
over the Internet in a manner available to children, the market
became flooded with software filters for blocking pornography from
personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Most Internet service providers and some Web browsers also offer
optional built-in filter services for customers who want to censor
Internet material.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the filters endorsed by the Federal
Communications Commission:
</P>
<P>
   AMERICA ONLINE _ (www.aol.com) offers as part of its membership
fee optional parental controls that block E-mail messages from
specific senders and confine access to certain sites. (800)
827-6364
</P>
<P>
   CYBERSITTER _ (www.cybersitter .com) blocks sites the customer
chooses and those from a list compiled and updated regularly by the
company. $39.95 (800) 388-2761
</P>
<P>
   CYBER PATROL _ (www.cyber patrol.com) selects objectionable
sites and updates the list daily; software also filters sites with
objectionable words or images. $29.95 (800) 828-2608
</P>
<P>
   CYBERSNOOP _ (www.pearlsw .com) monitors sites visited. $49.95
(800) 832-7596
</P>
<P>
   NET NANNY _ (www.netnanny.com) masks offensive words or shuts
down browser that accesses banned sites. $39.95 (800) 340-7177
</P>
<P>
   SURFWATCH _ (www.surfwatch .com) lists 25,000 banned sites.
$49.95 (800) 458-6600

 c.1999 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   BERLIN _ Sitting at a makeshift confer ence table a white table
top supported by cardboard boxes _ in the Spartan Berlin
headquarters of Ebay Germany, the 26-year-old chief executive,
Oliver Samwer, can barely contain his excitement as he outlines his
company's spectacular and, in Germany right now, singular success
story.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take long: Last September, he and his 24-year-old
brother, Alexander, finished their respective university degrees
and packed their bags to join their brother, Marc, 28, as interns
in Silicon Valley. There they came across Ebay, the on-line auction
site, and thought they saw a niche for a similar site in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers talked it over at Christmas, quit their internships
and returned to Germany in January to start their own auction site
on the Ebay model. They moved from their hometown of Cologne to
Berlin, recruited three college friends (their 25-year-old chief
financial officer, Karel Doerner, who worked at the consulting firm
McKinsey &AMP; Company for two months, was the only founder with
corporate job experience) and founded Alando.de in February.
</P>
<P>
   On March 1, the site went on-line. Goldman, Sachs called on May
17 to say that Ebay was interested. Ebay's founder, Pierre Omidyar,
flew to Berlin on May 21, and on May 30 _ less than a hundred days
after founding the company _ the six 20-somethings sold Alando.de
to Ebay for $43 million.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the story has inspired a flock of other young
German entrepreneurs to undertake E-based start-up companies. But
it remains an exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, E-commerce is taking place in Germany,'' said
Alexander Artope, a co-author of the European Communication
Council's report on the Internet economy. ``But other than
auctions, nothing's happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Germany has more Web users than either Britain or France; it has
one of the best telecommunications infrastructures in the world and
is awaiting the drop in Internet toll charges that should follow
the recent deregulation of its telephone industry.
</P>
<P>
   But industry insiders put Germany anywhere from eight months to
five years behind the United States in E-commerce development.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer reluctance to give out financial information over the
Internet and unfamiliarity with credit card payment _ 80 percent of
Germans do not have credit cards _ present significant barriers to
Web browsing and buying.
</P>
<P>
   Add to this the conservative business practices of the
traditional media publishing corporations that dominate Internet
business in Germany (only one of the top 10 content providers
offers Internet services exclusively, according to the New Media
Report, based in Munich), and it is no surprise that in Germany,
E-commerce has had a slow start.
</P>
<P>
   There has also been a shortage of the kind of hard-charging,
baby-faced, overnight millionaires that have produced the dot-com
mania fueling start-ups across America.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Oliver Samwer and his colleagues, Scott Barnum,
Ebay's international general manager and vice president, said: ``In
the German Internet-commerce world, these guys are very atypical.
But they represent a new group of entrepreneurs that is trying to
take hold. They are successful role models for entrepreneurs, and
there haven't been that many success stories.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be why this success story has entranced Germans. The
young men have become German media darlings, and with scores of
magazine articles and more than 15 television appearances under
their belts, they have set off a wave of young start-ups.

   In the auction world alone, more than a hundred sites have
sprung up since Alando, now called Ebay Germany. The founders offer
consulting to fledgling entrepreneurships and have started Silicon
City, a social networking group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alando helped raise the attention for E-commerce ventures on a
large scale'' in Germany, said Christian Bachem, an on-line
strategy consultant based in Berlin. But, he added, Alando's
copycat model ``might be a viable trend in German E-commerce, but
it does not at all represent the German E-commerce market.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Samwer is enthusiastic about the nascent entrepreneurial
community he has helped to create, saying that his own team would
have welcomed the mentoring that it regularly dispenses to young
start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   But he looks back with nostalgia at the skin-of-their-teeth
route that the founders of Alando took, which included offering up
their own childhood model trains at a fraction of their value to
get the site going.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom,'' he said, ``is still really sad about the trains.''

<P>
   A lot of words have been used to describe David Bowie, but
``conventional'' is not one of them. So it is probably not too
surprising that on Sept. 21 Bowie released his latest album _
``hours ...'' _ not in record stores but on the Internet. Just
download in Liquid Audio or Microsoft Audio 4.0.
</P>
<P>
   Bowie is the most well-known artist trying to sell _ for about
$18, the list price of a compact disk _ a full-length recording in
a download format providing copyright protection.
</P>
<P>
   No one is sure how many people will pay that much for an
unpackaged data file, even if it is the creation of a legendary
rocker, and skeptics have suggested that the album's title refers
to how long the download will take over an average modem.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reaction, Bowie's experiment is a response to
changes throughout the music industry brought on by the popularity
of MP3. Artists of every stripe are using the Internet to
distribute audio in hopes of establishing a following, reviving a
career or promoting new work.
</P>
<P>
   Since last year, the Internet has seen an explosion of legally
downloadable music by prominent artists. New music is now regularly
appearing on-line from the major labels, which have co-opted the
digital download trend as a direct-marketing gambit.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth quarter of 1999 is expected to see a record number of
famous performers offering free audio samples on-line to entice
holiday purchases. The Red Hot Chili Peppers, Creed and Def Leppard
recently began new albums with on-line previews designed to build
anticipation before their release dates.
</P>
<P>
   As Chuck D of the rap group Public Enemy said in a recent
interview: ``The Internet happened to be a dog. You either pet the
dog, or let the dog bite your leg.''
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, it was not so easy for the artists who early on
made their music available for downloading. At the time, Public
Enemy and the Beastie Boys fought their labels' demands to remove
MP3 files of their music from their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Recording Industry Association of America, the
music industry trade group, was tracking down unauthorized MP3
distributors and formed the Secure Digital Music Initiative to
establish standards for protecting copyrights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were this big band endorsing this thing the industry was
trying to be united against,'' Mike D (aka Mike Diamond) of the
Beastie Boys told The Wall Street Journal in December.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck D _ Carlton Ridenhour _ put it more bluntly on
Sonicnet.com: ``The execs, lawyers and accountants who lately have
made most of the money in the music biz are now running scared from
the technology that evens out the creative field and makes artists
harder to pimp.''
</P>
<P>
   The Beastie Boys agreed to remove their MP3 files, live tracks
recorded on tour, in December. But by April, their label, Capitol
Records, had approved release of the group's remixes and video on
its site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Beastie Boys are a good example of the industry's shifting
mind-set on the Internet,'' said Hillary Rosen, the president and
chief executive of the Recording Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
   They started out posting MP3 files on their Web site, ``and
getting a bit of hype out of having this public fight with their
label,'' she said. ``Their contract is up this year; they could
have done anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead, they signed a new deal with Capitol for a $30 or $40
million advance,'' Rosen said. ``They found that the existing
system had a lot of advantages for them _ No. 1, that they got a
lot of cash up front.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, on-line proponents were saying that digital
downloads would eliminate the need for record companies by allowing
artists to take music directly to audiences. Instead, the rise of
downloadable audio has spawned new companies like Emusic.com,
Mp3.com and Atomic Pop that are pioneering Internet strategies for
artist development, marketing and distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Al Teller, the founder and president of Atomic Pop, an Internet
label, is a former chairman and chief executive of MCA and
president of CBS Records. He speaks for underground and developing
artists when he says, ``There's an enormous frustration with how
many artists get lost in the system and the cost of doing business
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Teller pursued Public Enemy after hearing of the group's
differences with Def Jam Records over offering music for download.
Atomic Pop then put the group's album ``There's a Poison Goin' On''
on sale through download in May, two months before the CD went to
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Atomic Pop, like other on-line labels, does not require artists
to sign long-term contracts or relinquish ownership of their master
recordings. Rather than offering artists an 8 percent to 12 percent
royalty on sales, as the major labels do, on-line labels give
artists a 50-50 net profit split.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement eliminates exceptions like ``free goods'' (CDs
given away for promotional purposes) that major labels use to
whittle away the base on which royalties are applied. Business
expenses for artist and label come off the top and must be
documented.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my mind, it's much more favorable to the artists,'' said
Richard Grabel, a music lawyer with Grubman, Indursky &AMP; Schindler
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Another frustrated performer was Greta Gaines. A former champion
professional snowboarder and an aspiring singer-songwriter, Gaines
signed with Giant Records in 1995. Soon afterward, Giant was
reorganized and renamed Revolution Records. New executives replaced
those who had promised to support Gaines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed the faith and guidance of people who loved my
music,'' she said. ``They said, `If you don't sell 250,000 units on
your first single, you're out of here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gaines completed an album for Giant/Revolution that was never
released and asked to cancel her contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so damaging to me for so many years,'' she said.
``Nobody would touch me.''
</P>
<P>
   She continued to write and perform music, however. Three months
ago, while preparing to release a debut CD on her own label, she
posted three songs to Mp3.com as an experiment. The site, which
does not charge for the service, also enables artists to get E-mail
directly from visitors who download their music.
</P>
<P>
   Gratified and surprised by listeners' responses, Gaines quickly
revamped her postings to better represent the new album.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Mp3.com called to tell her that Alanis Morissette and
Tori Amos had selected her to open on their tour, sponsored by the
site.
</P>
<P>
   Now her single, ``FireFly,'' is getting limited airplay at adult
album alternative radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I start selling records and my song starts doing well,''
she said, ``it will be a complete revolution in the odds an artist
has'' of hitting it big.
</P>
<P>
   Gaines says she will not sign with a major label.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I go on to have a major rock career, it will largely be
based on the Internet,'' she said.

 c.1999 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Kevin Lacey, a 41-year-old architect, was no gambler.
He had never even been to Las Vegas, Nev. But when he saw a
magazine advertisement about playing blackjack on the Internet, he
was intrigued.
</P>
<P>
   Just for fun, he found the Web site, keyed in his credit card,
played a few hands and won a couple of dollars. That was three
years ago. Now Mr. Lacey is more than $60,000 in debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've maxed out seven credit cards,'' said Lacey, who recently
entered a gambling addiction program. ``I've got to get this
monster under control.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of ``cybercasinos'' have come on line since 1995,
giving almost anyone with a computer and a credit card the chance
to gamble. Americans last year wagered an estimated $1 billion on
line in a form that thrives in a legal twilight zone as advances in
technology have outpaced the law.
</P>
<P>
   These cybercasinos are based offshore, many of them on Caribbean
islands, because gambling in the United States requires specific
legal permission. On-line casinos blur those legal boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Is it illegal for a woman in Ohio, for instance, to place a bet
with a cybercasino in Antigua? Does the betting occur in Ohio or in
Antigua?
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, has introduced a bill that
would prohibit on-line gambling by giving judges the power to shut
down Internet providers who give Web sites to cybercasinos.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved the measure last year 90 to 9, but it did
not come to a vote in the House of Representatives before Congress
adjourned. The bill is expected to come to the Senate floor again
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee's
subcommittee on technology, said he thought that Internet gambling
already violated the law against sports betting, which, although
permitted in Las Vegas, was banned under the Federal Wire Act of
1961. But the law does not address nonsports betting.
</P>
<P>
   And the 1961 measure could eventually be irrelevant if satellite
transmission or radio waves replace telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   For now, some states have taken separate approaches, none of
them altogether effective. Illinois and Louisiana have banned
Internet gambling. Minnesota is studying whether on-line wagering
could be regulated and licensed. And Missouri has taken court
action against on-line gambling providers.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Nixon, the Attorney General of Missouri, has filed a Federal
suit in Kansas City against the Coeur D'Alene Indian tribe in
Idaho, contending that the tribe's lottery and bingo Web site
violates Missouri's consumer laws, which prohibit the sale of
illegal goods or services.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe, meanwhile, contends that the wagering is legal
because it is based in a sovereign American Indian nation, where
wagering is permitted.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri also filed suit against a Pennsylvania man for running
an Internet gambling site. The man pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor
charge last year and was fined $27,000.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutions of Internet gambling remain rarer than a poker
hand of four aces. Sue Schneider, who publishes an on-line magazine
on computer gambling, Interactive Gaming News, said it would be
impossible to stop people from wagering over the Internet. She said
that more than 500 sites offered gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she said, states and the Federal Government should
regulate the industry. Australia, she noted, has recently started
to license on-line casinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could regulate them just like you regulate any land-based
gambling operation,'' Schneider said.
</P>
<P>
   Dianne Meyer, the publisher of Rolling Good Times On-Line,
another Internet magazine that reports about on-line gambling, said
a prohibition would drive the industry underground. That would
leave consumers with no protection, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an unregulated industry that desperately needs to be
regulated,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But on-line gambling has relatively few defenders. In June, the
National Gambling Impact Study Commission, created by Congress,
called for a ban on Internet gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Most professional sports leagues, as well as the National
Collegiate Athletic Association, have called for the prohibition of
on-line wagering. The Las Vegas casino industry has called for a
ban as well.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Fahrenkopf, the president of the American Gaming
Association, which represents the casino industry, said he scoffed
at the notion that his group's opposition to on-line gambling was
rooted in a fear of competition. He said the industry's chief
concern was that Internet gambling would tarnish all operators of
casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who support the ban, however, acknowledge that
enforcement could be difficult. And the Internet providers have
chafed at being forced to act as a sheriff expected to keep outlaws
out of a virtual Dodge City.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging those concerns, the Kyl measure would relieve
Internet providers of the responsibility to block on-line casinos
in two instances: if it was technologically impossible to block
access or if it was prohibitively burdensome to do so.
</P>
<P>
   While operators tend to be mysterious, surveys have gathered
some information about users. On-line gamblers tend to be white men
ages 20 to 40, often wagering on sports, said Kevin O'Neill, a
spokesman for the Council on Compulsive Gambling of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Sports betting is popular on the Internet, he said, ``because
everybody knows the outcome of a game _ you can't cheat on that.''
</P>
<P>
   On-line casinos typically set up accounts with customers that
debit a credit card. Losses are charged to the card, while winnings
are tallied as a credit.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, it has been relatively easy for on-line casinos to
open for business. Nearly two dozen of them are based in Antigua,
where a license can be bought for $100,000 or less, and there are
no taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on gambling say on-line wagering removes most of the
social barriers that inhibit gambling. There is no travel. And it
can be done in private at home, so no one else has to know about
it.
</P>
<P>
   Lacey, the architect who lost $60,000 to Internet gambling, said
he started wagering on his computer as a way to forget off-line
frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found it as a means of escaping life's problems,'' he said.
``I was in a bad marriage. And I had the early stages of
Parkinson's.''
</P>
<P>
   The gambling problem, he said, is a much fiercer foe than his
health problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Parkinson's, I can control that with medication,'' he
said. ``That gambling, that's a harder thing to control.''

<P>
   Click on Gucci.com and what do you get? A Web site under
construction. Point that browser toward Prada.com? There is a
picture of a smoldering model, but no handbags are available for
purchase. Perhaps, you think, a dress from Christian Dior.com? Oh,
you crazy fool-for-fashion you.
</P>
<P>
   While bookshops blossom and drugstores multiply, luxury vendors
have only tiptoed into the on-line space, which they perceive as a
little too low rent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web works well for standardized products, but with fashion
you reinvent the product every six months, with new cuts and new
fabrics that look different in different lights,'' says Godo
Kraemer, the director of international public relations for Hugo
Boss, summing up the Zeitgeist of the elite houses.
</P>
<P>
   The sleek suit maker whose creations cost as much as $1,200 at
stores like Saks Fifth Avenue has plans for an informational site
only.
</P>
<P>
   And although merchants certainly will not acknowledge it, there
is also the Wichita (as in Kansas) problem. A large part of the
cost of any luxury item is its exclusive image.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perceived lack of demand drives supply,'' said Mike May, who
follows the sector for Jupiter Communications, the Web research
company. ``The reason a Prada bag costs $450 is that you can only
get it at a very few exclusive shops. If anybody in the world could
buy a Prada bag, the name would lose some of its cachet.''
</P>
<P>
   But members of the pashmina shawl set should not despair. The
lures for luxury's prime-time players to join the Web rush are
great. For one thing, counterfeit merchandise being sold on the Web
is a growing problem, and what better way to frustrate virtual
swindlers than to offer the merchandise through an official site.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is also improving. Pictures of clothing on the Web
can lack texture and true color, but software advances will make it
possible this fall to see the weave of the Irish cable sweater
undulate in its full sumptuousness.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the alluring fact that the average Web user has
twice the income of the average American. Top style houses are
watching closely and have noticed that there are customers blithely
willing to plunk down $30,000 for diamond stud earrings or $15,000
for a Queen Anne dresser at an auction site.
</P>
<P>
   Many are now investigating how to exploit the medium without
angering the traditional retailers that are their biggest buyers.
One option may be to design clothing lines to be sold only on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, as Gucci and Hugo Boss dally, the Web is
beginning to fill with lesser-known, but not lesser-cost, purveyors
of couture, art and jewelry. People who want to shop for luxury
goods now will probably end up at a site that is category specific.
Everything from diamonds to antique automobiles has its own
peddler.
</P>
<P>
   Nextmonet.com, for example, hopes to lead well-compensated
professionals to their inner art collector. Most of its portfolio
is from mid-career artists who are ``underexposed,'' with works
costing $2,000 to $7,000.
</P>
<P>
   Myrna Nickelsen, the site's chief executive and co-founder,
describes her customers as ``people who drive BMWs and are ready to
graduate from posters but know nothing about art.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the site are not only introduced to artists and
their works but are offered art history lessons and industry
gossip.
</P>
<P>
   The other type of luxury site is a loosely knit front for a
dozen or more upscale retailers. Bestselections.com is essentially
a mall with a store roster that reads like a shopping diary for the
international jet set.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers at this site can browse by antique jewelry selected by
Catherine Prevost, proprietor of a chic shop in the Knightsbridge
section of London, or order million-thread count sheets from
Roberta East Linens in East Hampton, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Styleclick.com offers a similar conglomeration-of-brands
approach, but instead of retailers it features wares from
manufacturers like Kenneth Cole, Anne Klein II and Trussardi
Leather.
</P>
<P>
   A word of warning: such mix-and-match sites offer a limited
amount of merchandise from their vendors, and often the poorer
selection at that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty-five percent of our purchases are $500 or more,'' brags
Maurizio Vecchione, Styleclick's chief executive. Maybe, but plenty
of embroidered T-shirts for $32 can be had at his site as well.
Similarly, at Bagley Home, a farm antiques shop on
Bestselections.com, it is easier to find chenille bunnies and
beeswax candles than 18th-century armoires.
</P>
<P>
   Luxuryfinder.com, which is being introduced by the New York
social fixtures James Finkelstein and Pamela Gross this fall, aims
at a more ambitious model: a luxury portal that is the equivalent
of a social secretary for the wired billionaire set.
</P>
<P>
   The site will, of course, offer necessities like a Ghurka laptop
carrying case for $1,295 and a bottle of Chateau Lafite at $10,000.
Luxuryfinder.com, by the way, will eschew more common brands like
Coach Leather, which Gross called ``too low end.''
</P>
<P>
   But Luxuryfinder will provide services like a calendar of
society events and tips by Lord Charles Spencer-Churchill, a
grandson of Consuela Vanderbilt, on how to behave like a British
aristocrat.
</P>
<P>
   Such ambitious competitors have already shaken a few of luxury's
big names out of their ennui. The luxury conglomerate LVMH Moet
Hennessy Louis Vuitton S.A., which owns couture houses like
Christian Dior and Givenchy, plans to test the Web waters.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Sephora.com, the international cosmetics and beauty
retailer, which is 80 percent owned by LVMH, will go live. The rest
of the company's brands will follow. LVMH, which once saw the Web
as a threat, now sees it as a matter of survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think everyone knows for sure how big the market is,
but the demographics are clear, the young affluent and aspiring
affluent customer are already there,'' said Myron Ullman, LVMH's
group managing director. ``So we will be, too.''

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   It's hard not to look at all the money being made on Internet
stocks and wonder, ``How do I get my share?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, you could bet your life savings on a company started by
teen-agers that has never had a dime of profit, with a stock that
seems to follow the course of the Coney Island Cyclone.
</P>
<P>
   Or take that recipe that was always such a big hit at the bake
sale, open SuperFudgeBrownies.com, and then sell stock to all your
friends on the PTA.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, you could plan to do all your Christmas shopping on
the Internet. Many Internet companies, and their investors, are so
desperate to get big fast that they are almost willing to bribe
people to shop with them. So the savvy cyberconsumer can find sites
selling all sorts of items at or below cost, or with free shipping
or all sorts of other giveaways.
</P>
<P>
   Competition has already driven prices for digital video disks
on-line to as much as 40 percent below the suggested retail level.
In many cases that means the price is well below the wholesale
cost.
</P>
<P>
   And enough $15 coupons and free shipping deals have been fired
in the bitter war between Drugstore.com and Planetrx.com that
customers could well hoard a year's worth of free shampoo or
toothpaste.
</P>
<P>
   You name it and someone has started a Web site to sell it:
Autoweb, Furniture.com, Ebags, Pets.com, even Partyjunk.com,
scheduled to be introduced this fall, for children's party favors.
There are thousands more, and nearly all of them are planning to
lose money for years.
</P>
<P>
   For on-line buyers, these good deals are still mixed with a lot
of frustration. It's often hard to find a site that sells what you
want. When you do, the sites can be slow and hard to navigate.
</P>
<P>
   If you place an order, too often the merchandise is not shipped
correctly, intact and on time. And there is nothing that Silicon
Valley has invented to let you tell by looking at a computer screen
whether the sweater will be scratchy or what the color really is.
</P>
<P>
   A survey by Jupiter Communications, a New York research firm,
found that the portion of buyers who said they were very satisfied
with their on-line shopping dropped to 43 percent this year from 63
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the qualms, more people are spending much more
money on-line every month. On America Online, only 37 percent of
its members had made an on-line purchase as of June of last year.
Today, it is up to 62 percent, or nearly 11 million shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter estimates that consumers will spend $15 billion in 1999.
Of that, $6 billion will be spent this Christmas, double what was
spent last year.
</P>
<P>
   For both business and Wall Street, the question now is: How big
can this get?
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, Sachs recently told clients it estimated that
ultimately 15 percent to 20 percent of the nation's retail sales
could flow over the Internet. And in many ways,
business-to-business electronic commerce is having an even bigger
effect and doing it faster, as everything from cattle farms to
steel mills use the Web to link to suppliers and customers.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder investors are backing companies that look like they
are growing fast, rather than those that are making a profit. To be
sure, there may be a touch of irrational exuberance causing the
stock market to value Etoys at $5.2 billion, far more than the $3.4
billion value of Toys ``R'' Us. Never mind that Toys ``R'' Us sells
400 times more toys than its upstart rival.
</P>
<P>
   Look behind all the technical wizardry of the sites, however,
and you'll see a lot of businesses that are staying together on
little more than packing tape and a prayer. After all, it's much
easier to make a pretty Web site, and advertise it on America
Online, than to make sure you have the goods the site is offering
in stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was a wake-up call for everybody,'' said Katherine
Borsecnik, the senior vice president in charge of America Online's
shopping area. ``People weren't prepared for the volumes that
peaked about a week before Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Wainright, now the chief executive of Pets.com, said she
learned her lesson when she spent a year running Reel.com, an
on-line video store that was having trouble keeping track of its
inventory and shipping orders on time.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got there, we had 50,000 customers, and 50,000 were mad
at us,'' she said. Reel has since been sold to Hollywood Video.
</P>
<P>
   Starting over at Pets.com early this year, Ms. Wainright
replaced the company's computer system with one that can handle 30
times its current volume. She leased a 120,000-square-foot
warehouse to stock everything and she is hiring three shifts of
people to staff it around the clock this Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, people were really excited to try something
new,'' she said. ``But this year, the customers are completely
unforgiving. They are not going to give you a second chance.''
</P>
<P>
   This fall will also mark the debut of services known as
electronic wallets that are meant to speed on-line shopping by
automatically sending previously entered information about the
shopper _ like credit-card numbers and shipping address _ to the
store.
</P>
<P>
   Last Christmas, many people who tried to shop on-line found an
even more basic problem: They couldn't find anyone selling what
they wanted to buy. In some cases that was because they didn't know
where to look.
</P>
<P>
   But by this year, the big Internet guides, including America
Online and Yahoo, will introduce new services that allow shoppers
to search for a specific item at hundreds of on-line stores and see
on one screen who carries it and what their prices are.
</P>
<P>
   Security is another main concern that, according to surveys of
Internet users, is keeping people from shopping on-line. With so
many sites appearing every day, it is hard to know the reliable
merchants from the fly-by-nights, so many people are wary of
sending their credit card numbers to anyone on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But a healthy suspicion, said David Medine, the associate
director of the Federal Trade Commission, should make people more
willing to use credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should always use their credit cards when they buy
on-line because of the strong consumer protection laws that let you
dispute charges on a credit card bill,'' Medine said. The most
consumers will pay in case of fraud is $50.
</P>
<P>
   That said, shoppers should have a field day.

 c.1999 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Hollywood agents, literary agents, real-estate agents, travel
agents _ now meet Internet agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intelligent agent'' programs and their kin, ``shopping bots,''
are among the hottest new areas of electronic commerce. They hold
out the promise of making shopping on the Internet better not just
by finding lower prices but by matching products to the needs and
tastes of individual consumers.
</P>
<P>
   While the term ``agent'' suggests a trustworthy representative
dispatched into the wilds of cyberspace bazaars, bot conveys the
image of a combative R2D2 scooting through the marketplace of some
distant planet pricing used space cruisers.
</P>
<P>
   The reality behind the names is different: Agents and bots are
programs, routines, algorithms _ strings of complicated
mathematical equations that are used to find and compare patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Zillman of Botspot, an agency that tracks software
agents, predicts that in five years, bots will be involved in most
on-line shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Electronic word of mouth,'' is the phrase that Prof. Pattie
Maes of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media
Laboratory uses to describe what some software agents bring to the
party.
</P>
<P>
   A pioneer in the field of software agents, Professor Maes has
become one of the most visible and articulate proponents of this
new type of program, which lets users learn by comparing their
preferences with those of what she calls their ``taste mates.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a real-estate agent or travel agent, a software shopping
agent has responsibility for finding products and prices, Professor
Maes said. One of the agent's responsibilities is to match the
user's preferences. Software agents take initiative, learn from the
habits of their clients and adapt to the market.
</P>
<P>
   At the MIT Media Laboratory, Professor Maes founded and directs
the Software Agents Group and holds the Sony Corporation Career
Development Chair. Two of her many projects have led to commercial
spinoffs that represent the two leading types of shopping bots.
</P>
<P>
   The first was Firefly, introduced in 1995, which helps make
individual recommendations for taste-based products like compact
disks, books and films. The other is Frictionless, which went into
service in August on the Lycos portal and other Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Frictionless is designed to shop for the best price and service
on less-frequently bought products, like cars or camcorders.
</P>
<P>
   Firefly is Professor Maes' best-known spinoff. It was one of the
first shopping bots to use intelligent agents and collaborative
filtering.
</P>
<P>
   Developed in the early 1990s, Firefly's software began as a site
called Helpful On-Line Music Recommendations, or HOMR, where users
could receive guidance in finding music recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Users rated a series of CDs to create individual profiles, which
were compared with profiles of other users with similar tastes to
generate suggestions for music the user might enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the HOMR project was spun off and incorporated first as
Agents, then under the friendlier name Firefly. Other sites,
including Reel.com, adopted similar techniques to help people
choose films. Some licensed the software from Firefly.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in April 1998, Firefly was sold to Microsoft, guaranteeing
its influence across one of the most powerful sets of on-line
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Firefly and other collaborative filtering systems take advantage
of the knowledge and tastes of customers. Sometimes the user fills
in a form on-line. At other times, the agent learns from a person's
buying or browsing patterns, as tracked by software from companies
like Doubleclick.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a college student might be presented only with the
restaurants that fit his or her budget; a diner on a
low-cholesterol diet might get a different list. Such
recommendation options, including those produced by Firefly's
competitor, Net Advantage for Barnesandnoble.com, are probably the
most familiar of the new bots.
</P>
<P>
   ``This type of recommendation technology only works for domains
where people buy on a regular basis,'' Professor Maes said. ``It's
great for books or music, but not, say, for a car, which you might
buy only every four to eight years.''
</P>
<P>
   For those kinds of products, a different kind of agent
technology, like Frictionless, works better.
</P>
<P>
   Frictionless also grew from Professor Maes' work at the MIT
Media Laboratory. It searches on-line shopping sites for products
with specific features at the best price.
</P>
<P>
   For example, on Frictionless, someone interested in buying a
laptop computer chooses among a set of user profiles, with names
that include ``road warrior,'' ``budget shopper'' and
``telecommuter.'' Each profile provides a list of product features,
among them weight, speed and memory, as well as information on the
vendor relating to warranty, availability and delivery.
</P>
<P>
   To further personalize the search, the user can rely on the
preset profile or edit it, rating factors like screen size and
product warranty on a scale of ``not important'' to ``very
important.''
</P>
<P>
   The greatest concern to users is privacy.
</P>
<P>
   `This is a major issue that deserves public discussion,''
Professor Maes said. The more an agent knows about you, the more
useful it can be.
</P>
<P>
   But while some shopping-bot companies promise not to sell
information to other companies, others give away their software and
plan to make money from selling the information they gather on
shopping patterns.
</P>
<P>
   A survey by Jupiter Communications, an industry tracking
company, suggested that more than 60 percent of shoppers remained
wary of giving information to an on-line site.
</P>
<P>
   Firefly hired an accounting firm to certify its privacy
practices, and Maes was an early backer of proposed industry
standards for privacy. The so-called Platform for Privacy
Preferences protocols are under discussion by the nonprofit World
Wide Web Consortium and enjoy the support of Microsoft, MCI
Worldcom, AT&AMP;T, IBM, Netscape, Oracle and other companies.
</P>
<P>
   But even if these standards _ which involve encrypting
information and obtaining permission from consumers to transfer
personal information _ become accepted, on-line shoppers may not
feel comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 18, just two days after Frictionless went on-line,
Firefly's site vanished, swallowed by Microsoft's Passport shopping
site, which will begin this fall. Many of Firefly's users were
dismayed despite Microsoft's assurances that privacy and other
policies would remain in place.
</P>
<P>
   Trust is vital to making software agents work well.
</P>
<P>
   One of Professor Maes' other projects at MIT seeks to bring
together people who have not met but have similar interests. The
program uses a survey of potentially sensitive information, like
people's mail, their personal files or lists of their interests.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to imagine how the program might be useful to link
scientists around the world for academic conferences, but its
working name suggests an even more dramatic matchmaking
possibility: It is called Yenta.

 c.1999 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   It is a Sunday night, and I have just sealed myself into an
E-cave. For the next five days, I will order all sustenance and
entertainment from the Net. I will hunker down in a bachelor pad in
Palo Alto, Calif., armed with credit card and mouse.
</P>
<P>
   I click my way to the checkout aisle of Webvan, an on-line
grover, to schedule a delivery time. Tomorrow morning would be
great. Then, crisis. I'm told that deliveries are first come, first
served. Webvan can deliver the same day, but the next available
appointment is Wednesday night. By then I could walk to the nearest
market and back _ on stilts.
</P>
<P>
   Will the on-line bazaar work for everyday survival, and as a
means for daily upkeep of heart, soul, body, mind and, foremost,
stomach?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MONDAY: LEARNING TO ORDER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In his quest for food, primitive man faced the woolly mammoth. I
face slothlike delivery schedules. Undaunted by my Webvan
disappointment, I set out on Monday morning to hunt and gather
21st-century style.
</P>
<P>
   A Web search turns up 69 sites offering ``grocery delivery,''
including Groceronline, Netgrocer and Electrolley. I pop into and
register at several sites, then head down the virtual aisles.
</P>
<P>
   But each time I go to check out, I learn delivery is either not
available in my area or will take three to 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   By noon, I change strategies. I search on ``food delivery, Palo
Alto'' and am led to Waiters.com, a service that takes on-line
orders for local restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   At one spot I know, the Good Earth, I point and click through
the menu. But I make rookie E-commerce errors, neglecting, for
example, to complete registration forms.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later my $32 order arrives. Hungry and having not seen
another human being in nearly 24 hours, I practically hug Louis,
the Waiters.com driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were you,'' he says, ``I would have ordered over the
phone. It's easier.''
</P>
<P>
   If he only knew. All day, I have battled not just delivery
schedules but a debilitating injury. I have hurt my left pinkie. I
jammed it in a recent basketball game, and it's swollen and purple,
like a mini-eggplant.
</P>
<P>
   I divine an answer: the cybermedic. A search for ``medical
advice'' returns the names of dozens of doctors who offer virtual
consultations. I even find a specialist, a sports orthopedist named
Stuart Zeman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people dread going to the doctor,'' his site says. ``It
can be expensive, inconvenient and stressful.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Zeman's alternative is an E-mail consultation for 10 bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is he inexpensive, he's also concise. You get one
paragraph to describe your malady, and the virtual physician's
response runs only a few lines. (Somewhere, an HMO executive is
taking copious notes.)
</P>
<P>
   And so by the end of the day, I have scored several small
E-commerce victories, including the fact that late in the
afternoon, I have discovered an on-line grocer called Peapod. I
arrange for a Tuesday delivery.
</P>
<P>
   When I go to bed, I have fed my brain with food, and I have
tended to my corpus with medical advice. Tomorrow, feeling more
seasoned in the ways of E-commerce, I will feed my soul. I will buy
a golf course.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TUESDAY: LIVING ROOM IS PERFECT FOR SINKING A 9-FOOTER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, not an entire golf course, but at least an indoor putting
green. This will permit me to test my E-commerce mettle, alleviate
the boredom that accompanies an on-line, in-house lifestyle and
address one of life's pressing concerns, improving my golf game.
</P>
<P>
   My search-engine request on Yahoo spits out nearly 40 possible
merchants, with names like Eagle Putting Greens and Chip-n-Putt.
</P>
<P>
   I settle on a shop called Big Moss Golf. This is partly because
it feels like a local store and partly because it promises to bring
my handicap out of the stratosphere. And partly because it has a
toll-free number for customer service, and I'm starting to get a
little lonely in the E-cave.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll have to work that out yourself,'' Tony Terisco says.
He's the owner of Big Moss Golf who sells me on the Big Moss
Original, a $159, nine-foot-long piece of carpet simulated to feel
like grass with a golf hole at one end.
</P>
<P>
   It dawns on me that it may be even more instructive to play
actual golf. But I'm in no mood to quibble. I pay an extra $30 for
overnight delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Just then, I receive a house call from my on-line doctor, Stuart
Zeman. ``You must get an X-ray,'' he prescribes in no uncertain
terms.
</P>
<P>
   Leave the house? Never!
</P>
<P>
   I decide to seek a second opinion. I fire off an E-mail to Dr.
Michele Moore, who runs a site called www.askyour familydoc.com.
She will give me a virtual bedside counsel for $25.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WEDNESDAY: AN ON-LINE WARRIOR VICTORIOUS IN BATTLE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Help. Send Prozac. Otherwise, I may torture and kill my
neighbor, who has been practicing the piano for hours.
</P>
<P>
   But I will combat her, E-commerce style. My weapons are earplugs
and aspirin. My destination is pharmaceutical sites. I settle on
Planetrx.com and Drugstore.com.
</P>
<P>
   I register at each site and check their delivery schedules. Then
I engage in a bit of hard-core price comparison. I open two browser
windows and compare the sites side by side, checking response time,
prices and product information.
</P>
<P>
   The arrows favor Planetrx. Minutes later, I ``walk out'' with
earplugs and Advil, opting for overnight delivery for an additional
$10. While I'm at it, I check out the stores' aisles of bandage
tape for my injured digit. Drugstore.com offers eight pages of
athletic tape and gauze products.
</P>
<P>
   This is when I realize I've E-volved into a wily E-commerce
veteran. I'm in and out of the drugstores in 10 minutes, far less
than it would have taken to drive to a pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
   Flush with success, I endeavor an E-commerce challenge with an
Olympic degree of difficulty. I'm going to use my modem to get my
cat to stop throwing up. I've tried the normal remedies, like
giving her soft foods and beer, but frankly, I inherited the cat
from an ex-girlfriend and I never could figure her out _ the cat, I
mean.
</P>
<P>
   I find a veterinarian to consult by E-mail. But then I ascend
further, pinpointing a service that in and of itself may illustrate
just how far this new commerce medium has come: Kay Cox, on-line
pet psychiatrist, www.getnet.com/petcouns/.
</P>
<P>
   Cox, a self-proclaimed ``pet therapist and talent scout,''
offers on-line consultation for $40 an hour. I send her an
electronic missive and assure the cat it will be OK.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, my own psychological salve has arrived _ my putting
green. John Tuggle, the UPS deliveryman, takes one look at me and
says, ``I think you need to get out of the house and go to the
shopping mall.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THURSDAY: THE MOMENT OF TRUTH _ SEARCHING FOR LOVE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They'' say it's hard to meet good people these days. ``They''
say it's tough to find a soul mate amid the cacophony of modern
life.
</P>
<P>
   Well, they've never met Kitten664.
</P>
<P>
   This is the woman I am paired up with by Matchmaker.com. The
on-line service concluded we may constitute a love connection by
comparing our answers to about 50 questions like personal hobbies,
income, height and weight and reading habits. Kitten664 and I
matched on 54 percent of our answers.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, we're both 5 feet 8 inches tall and weigh 160 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   It's true: I soon realize that among the criteria the company
matches are our height and weight, which doesn't seem like a
quality that either sex typically wants in a mate.
</P>
<P>
   In a second attempt at a dating service, I fill out a
questionnaire on a site that promises to help me find my soul mate.
But when I finish, it takes me to an advertisement for free,
on-line pornography.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think this is a site I'd like to bring home to my
mother.
</P>
<P>
   But there is good news on my penultimate day in the E-cave. The
swelling in my pinkie has gone down. This is partly thanks to
E-mail from Dr. Moore, who advocates icing and elevating the
finger.
</P>
<P>
   Also, I've ordered lunch with ease from Waiters.com _ without
even needing to register because my registration is already on
file.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the cat has quit vomiting.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FRIDAY: A LITTLE WISDOM GLEANED FROM LIVING LIFE ON-LINE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just when I am feeling as if I may never need the outside world
again, fate intervenes. My office calls and tells me I must go on
an urgent assignment. My week in the E-cave is cut short.
</P>
<P>
   I reflect on the four days gone by. I have discovered that with
a little practice and experience, the Net can yield some powerful
dividends. Product information and diversity are unparalleled.
Plus, there is extraordinary capacity to compare prices.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the downside. The on-line experience can be an
isolating one. Some very important sense of community develops from
shopping in the flesh, despite the hassles of driving, parking,
fighting crowds and arguing whether you really have 10 or 11 items
in the express lane.
</P>
<P>
   There are other bugs, too. Like sometimes an E-commerce site
just freezes up. It's like walking up to a sales clerk in a store,
asking a question, then having him glower at you before turning
around and walking away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I'm talking to you,'' I shouted at one point during the
week to a frozen site.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, I conclude there are two basic and unassailable
tenets of the E-commerce life: (1) you can order anything under the
sun over the Net _ and in greater selection than in any other
single venue on the planet, and (2) plan ahead, or you'll starve to
death.

 c.1999 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Where can an E-business struggling to fend off rising
competition turn for a model of how to make money on the Web? To
the entrepreneurs who were the first to make E-commerce pay and
whose businesses are still the most profitable sector of the
Internet: the on-line pornographers.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does the cyberskin game hold lessons for all sorts of
on-line businesses, experts say, but pornography sites have
pioneered technical and marketing developments that are at the
heart of the business plans of many enterprises that would not be
caught dead on the same server.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of lessons to be had from the on-line porn's
success on the Web,'' said David Zinman, the vice president for
marketing of Adknowledge of Palo Alto, Calif., which charges site
owners to gauge how well their on-line advertisements generate
leads and sales.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Tiarra, whose on-line company, the Tiarra Corporation,
creates advertisements and strategies for sex-oriented Web sites,
said that compared with his clients and their competitors, ``the
nonadult side of the Web has always been a year behind the curve in
marketing strategies.''
</P>
<P>
   This innovative streak has been shaped by two realities: Unlike
many other Web businesses, sex sites have a product that people are
willing to pay for but that almost anyone can produce.
</P>
<P>
   There would be no sex sites if sex did not sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike major mainstream companies, sex sites had no off-line
revenue stream,'' said Mr. Tiarra, who is also president of United
Adult Sites, a trade organization of 500 on-line sex companies.
``You have to make it on your own.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on, visiting sex sites meant long downloads and slow video
clips, but operators found ways to transmit large pictures despite
narrow bandwidths.
</P>
<P>
   As the Internet became awash with sex sites, the operators
scrambled to develop a way to use existing on-line technology to
get pictures to Web surfers for the few moments they would land on
a site.
</P>
<P>
   With income essentially based on speed of content flow, Web site
designers began writing programs that tweaked technology to make
pages and photos load more quickly to grab their share of the
market.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting sites were not always coherent and flowing, but
they delivered the product quickly, and that drew browsers and kept
them from skipping to the next sex site.
</P>
<P>
   Creators of sex sites used tips and tricks in writing Web page
scripts so that sexy selling points loaded onto the screen first
before less appetizing elements, like sign-up fees.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Web's sex sites make money by charging for entry to
a video gallery, usually by a membership bought with a credit card.
Many also carry paid advertisements for larger sites. Free sites
profit by carrying links to other sites, which pay fractions of a
cent each time a customer clicks through.
</P>
<P>
   With profits tied to traffic on the site, the battle for the
most clicks was on. Some site operators designed tricks to lure
casual surfers to accidentally visit sex sites. Some devised loops
to repeatedly click onto sites, including manipulation of the back
key to keep reloading a page.
</P>
<P>
   Stealth redirection techniques cropped up, including writing
programs to create pop-up browsers that emerged as users left
sites, creating a ``no exit'' barrage of windows and prompts. Web
sites began feeding encoded key words for sites unrelated to sex
into search engines, drawing unsuspecting browsers and causing
pop-up advertisements to appear when certain key words were
entered.
</P>
<P>
   They bought rights to commonly used names of Web sites with
altered suffixes. For example, browsers seeking the Presidential
Web site at www.Whitehouse.gov/ got a sex site if, by mistake, they
typed in www.Whitehouse.com.
</P>
<P>
   Some sites began requesting credit card information as proof of
age for ``free trials,'' adding in fine print that membership
charges automatically would begin afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Tiarra said, mainstream Web site owners were more
complacent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were coming into this saying, `Is this going to work?'''
he said. ``We came in saying, `How am I going to make enough money
to quit my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, mainstream companies are hiring designers of sex
sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're looking for successful strategies, so they're going to
get the guys who had the most competitors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Duvall, who assesses sex-oriented sites, said there was a
limit to what mainstream sites could copy from the pornographic
ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with copying porn sites is that sex is the
compelling content, and you can never really compete with that,''
Duvall said.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the field's ferocious rivalry, sex sites offer
lessons in the benefits of cooperation, too, said Duvall, a former
newspaper advertising saleswoman who two years ago used $500 and an
old Power Mac to set up her own Web site, Jane's 'Net Sex Guide,
which reviews and rates sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it co-opetition, and you don't see it much on the
nonadult sites,'' she said. ``Even a link trade is a big deal.
You're only sending away a user that is leaving anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream companies using click-through referrals should
research the sex-site industry to learn how to avoid getting
cheated, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller on-line pornography sites formed larger networks
offering comprehensive memberships and then splitting the profits _
resembling America Online's more recent decision to develop an
electronic network that would allow members to shop at many retail
Web sites with one credit account.
</P>
<P>
   They also formed large, free supersites, where each company
would post its own click-through banner.
</P>
<P>
   Another example of the strategy of cross-linking or
link-swapping was the formation of referral rings, networks in
which sites refer customers to one another.
</P>
<P>
   Sophisticated tracking systems were then designed to count the
referrals that became paying customers, so sites could reward one
another with a percentage of the sign-up fee. This practice has
been adopted by many mainstream sites, like Amazon.com and
Beyond.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``The on-line porn industry has driven Web technology just as it
has with all new media,'' said Seth Warshavsky, the chief executive
of the Internet Entertainment Group, a sex-oriented on-line company
based in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The adult industry entrepreneurs have been a lot more
aggressive developing marketing strategies because they see a
direct return on everything they put out,'' he said. ``They're all
players willing to take a risk to develop new marketing strategies,
and only now are a lot of the mainstream on-line companies applying
those concepts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the porn industry, you have a tremendous demand for the
material product,'' Zinman said. ``Nonadult industry has to acquire
the kind of information that consumers will want to pay for to make
a profitable business model. Until then, profitable mainstream Web
sites will continue to be an oxymoron.''
</P>
<P>

 &UR; SIDEBAR: KEEPING IT OUT OF YOUR HOUSE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the United States Supreme Court overturned a 1997 Federal
law that prohibited the dissemination of sexually explicit material
over the Internet in a manner available to children, the market
became flooded with software filters for blocking pornography from
personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Most Internet service providers and some Web browsers also offer
optional built-in filter services for customers who want to censor
Internet material.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the filters endorsed by the Federal
Communications Commission:
</P>
<P>
   AMERICA ONLINE _ (www.aol.com) offers as part of its membership
fee optional parental controls that block E-mail messages from
specific senders and confine access to certain sites. (800)
827-6364
</P>
<P>
   CYBERSITTER _ (www.cybersitter .com) blocks sites the customer
chooses and those from a list compiled and updated regularly by the
company. $39.95 (800) 388-2761
</P>
<P>
   CYBER PATROL _ (www.cyber patrol.com) selects objectionable
sites and updates the list daily; software also filters sites with
objectionable words or images. $29.95 (800) 828-2608

<P>
   BERLIN _ Sitting at a makeshift confer ence table a white table
top supported by cardboard boxes _ in the Spartan Berlin
headquarters of Ebay Germany, the 26-year-old chief executive,
Oliver Samwer, can barely contain his excitement as he outlines his
company's spectacular and, in Germany right now, singular success
story.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take long: Last September, he and his 24-year-old
brother, Alexander, finished their respective university degrees
and packed their bags to join their brother, Marc, 28, as interns
in Silicon Valley. There they came across Ebay, the on-line auction
site, and thought they saw a niche for a similar site in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers talked it over at Christmas, quit their internships
and returned to Germany in January to start their own auction site
on the Ebay model. They moved from their hometown of Cologne to
Berlin, recruited three college friends (their 25-year-old chief
financial officer, Karel Doerner, who worked at the consulting firm
McKinsey &AMP; Company for two months, was the only founder with
corporate job experience) and founded Alando.de in February.
</P>
<P>
   On March 1, the site went on-line. Goldman, Sachs called on May
17 to say that Ebay was interested. Ebay's founder, Pierre Omidyar,
flew to Berlin on May 21, and on May 30 _ less than a hundred days
after founding the company _ the six 20-somethings sold Alando.de
to Ebay for $43 million.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the story has inspired a flock of other young
German entrepreneurs to undertake E-based start-up companies. But
it remains an exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, E-commerce is taking place in Germany,'' said
Alexander Artope, a co-author of the European Communication
Council's report on the Internet economy. ``But other than
auctions, nothing's happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Germany has more Web users than either Britain or France; it has
one of the best telecommunications infrastructures in the world and
is awaiting the drop in Internet toll charges that should follow
the recent deregulation of its telephone industry.
</P>
<P>
   But industry insiders put Germany anywhere from eight months to
five years behind the United States in E-commerce development.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer reluctance to give out financial information over the
Internet and unfamiliarity with credit card payment _ 80 percent of
Germans do not have credit cards _ present significant barriers to
Web browsing and buying.
</P>
<P>
   Add to this the conservative business practices of the
traditional media publishing corporations that dominate Internet
business in Germany (only one of the top 10 content providers
offers Internet services exclusively, according to the New Media
Report, based in Munich), and it is no surprise that in Germany,
E-commerce has had a slow start.
</P>
<P>
   There has also been a shortage of the kind of hard-charging,
baby-faced, overnight millionaires that have produced the dot-com
mania fueling start-ups across America.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Oliver Samwer and his colleagues, Scott Barnum,
Ebay's international general manager and vice president, said: ``In
the German Internet-commerce world, these guys are very atypical.
But they represent a new group of entrepreneurs that is trying to
take hold. They are successful role models for entrepreneurs, and
there haven't been that many success stories.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be why this success story has entranced Germans. The
young men have become German media darlings, and with scores of
magazine articles and more than 15 television appearances under
their belts, they have set off a wave of young start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   In the auction world alone, more than a hundred sites have
sprung up since Alando, now called Ebay Germany. The founders offer
consulting to fledgling entrepreneurships and have started Silicon
City, a social networking group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alando helped raise the attention for E-commerce ventures on a
large scale'' in Germany, said Christian Bachem, an on-line
strategy consultant based in Berlin. But, he added, Alando's
copycat model ``might be a viable trend in German E-commerce, but
it does not at all represent the German E-commerce market.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Samwer is enthusiastic about the nascent entrepreneurial
community he has helped to create, saying that his own team would
have welcomed the mentoring that it regularly dispenses to young
start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   But he looks back with nostalgia at the skin-of-their-teeth
route that the founders of Alando took, which included offering up
their own childhood model trains at a fraction of their value to
get the site going.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom,'' he said, ``is still really sad about the trains.''

<P>
   A lot of words have been used to describe David Bowie, but
``conventional'' is not one of them. So it is probably not too
surprising that on Sept. 21 Bowie released his latest album _
``hours ...'' _ not in record stores but on the Internet. Just
download in Liquid Audio or Microsoft Audio 4.0.
</P>
<P>
   Bowie is the most well-known artist trying to sell _ for about
$18, the list price of a compact disk _ a full-length recording in
a download format providing copyright protection.
</P>
<P>
   No one is sure how many people will pay that much for an
unpackaged data file, even if it is the creation of a legendary
rocker, and skeptics have suggested that the album's title refers
to how long the download will take over an average modem.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reaction, Bowie's experiment is a response to
changes throughout the music industry brought on by the popularity
of MP3. Artists of every stripe are using the Internet to
distribute audio in hopes of establishing a following, reviving a
career or promoting new work.
</P>
<P>
   Since last year, the Internet has seen an explosion of legally
downloadable music by prominent artists. New music is now regularly
appearing on-line from the major labels, which have co-opted the
digital download trend as a direct-marketing gambit.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth quarter of 1999 is expected to see a record number of
famous performers offering free audio samples on-line to entice
holiday purchases. The Red Hot Chili Peppers, Creed and Def Leppard
recently began new albums with on-line previews designed to build
anticipation before their release dates.
</P>
<P>
   As Chuck D of the rap group Public Enemy said in a recent
interview: ``The Internet happened to be a dog. You either pet the
dog, or let the dog bite your leg.''
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, it was not so easy for the artists who early on
made their music available for downloading. At the time, Public
Enemy and the Beastie Boys fought their labels' demands to remove
MP3 files of their music from their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Recording Industry Association of America, the
music industry trade group, was tracking down unauthorized MP3
distributors and formed the Secure Digital Music Initiative to
establish standards for protecting copyrights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were this big band endorsing this thing the industry was
trying to be united against,'' Mike D (aka Mike Diamond) of the
Beastie Boys told The Wall Street Journal in December.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck D _ Carlton Ridenhour _ put it more bluntly on
Sonicnet.com: ``The execs, lawyers and accountants who lately have
made most of the money in the music biz are now running scared from
the technology that evens out the creative field and makes artists
harder to pimp.''
</P>
<P>
   The Beastie Boys agreed to remove their MP3 files, live tracks
recorded on tour, in December. But by April, their label, Capitol
Records, had approved release of the group's remixes and video on
its site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Beastie Boys are a good example of the industry's shifting
mind-set on the Internet,'' said Hillary Rosen, the president and
chief executive of the Recording Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
   They started out posting MP3 files on their Web site, ``and
getting a bit of hype out of having this public fight with their
label,'' she said. ``Their contract is up this year; they could
have done anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead, they signed a new deal with Capitol for a $30 or $40
million advance,'' Rosen said. ``They found that the existing
system had a lot of advantages for them _ No. 1, that they got a
lot of cash up front.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, on-line proponents were saying that digital
downloads would eliminate the need for record companies by allowing
artists to take music directly to audiences. Instead, the rise of
downloadable audio has spawned new companies like Emusic.com,
Mp3.com and Atomic Pop that are pioneering Internet strategies for
artist development, marketing and distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Al Teller, the founder and president of Atomic Pop, an Internet
label, is a former chairman and chief executive of MCA and
president of CBS Records. He speaks for underground and developing
artists when he says, ``There's an enormous frustration with how
many artists get lost in the system and the cost of doing business
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Teller pursued Public Enemy after hearing of the group's
differences with Def Jam Records over offering music for download.
Atomic Pop then put the group's album ``There's a Poison Goin' On''
on sale through download in May, two months before the CD went to
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Atomic Pop, like other on-line labels, does not require artists
to sign long-term contracts or relinquish ownership of their master
recordings. Rather than offering artists an 8 percent to 12 percent
royalty on sales, as the major labels do, on-line labels give
artists a 50-50 net profit split.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement eliminates exceptions like ``free goods'' (CDs
given away for promotional purposes) that major labels use to
whittle away the base on which royalties are applied. Business
expenses for artist and label come off the top and must be
documented.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my mind, it's much more favorable to the artists,'' said
Richard Grabel, a music lawyer with Grubman, Indursky &AMP; Schindler
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Another frustrated performer was Greta Gaines. A former champion
professional snowboarder and an aspiring singer-songwriter, Gaines
signed with Giant Records in 1995. Soon afterward, Giant was
reorganized and renamed Revolution Records. New executives replaced
those who had promised to support Gaines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed the faith and guidance of people who loved my
music,'' she said. ``They said, `If you don't sell 250,000 units on
your first single, you're out of here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gaines completed an album for Giant/Revolution that was never
released and asked to cancel her contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so damaging to me for so many years,'' she said.
``Nobody would touch me.''
</P>
<P>
   She continued to write and perform music, however. Three months
ago, while preparing to release a debut CD on her own label, she
posted three songs to Mp3.com as an experiment. The site, which
does not charge for the service, also enables artists to get E-mail
directly from visitors who download their music.
</P>
<P>
   Gratified and surprised by listeners' responses, Gaines quickly
revamped her postings to better represent the new album.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Mp3.com called to tell her that Alanis Morissette and
Tori Amos had selected her to open on their tour, sponsored by the
site.
</P>
<P>
   Now her single, ``FireFly,'' is getting limited airplay at adult
album alternative radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I start selling records and my song starts doing well,''
she said, ``it will be a complete revolution in the odds an artist
has'' of hitting it big.
</P>
<P>
   Gaines says she will not sign with a major label.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I go on to have a major rock career, it will largely be
based on the Internet,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Kevin Lacey, a 41-year-old architect, was no gambler.
He had never even been to Las Vegas, Nev. But when he saw a
magazine advertisement about playing blackjack on the Internet, he
was intrigued.
</P>
<P>
   Just for fun, he found the Web site, keyed in his credit card,
played a few hands and won a couple of dollars. That was three
years ago. Now Mr. Lacey is more than $60,000 in debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've maxed out seven credit cards,'' said Lacey, who recently
entered a gambling addiction program. ``I've got to get this
monster under control.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of ``cybercasinos'' have come on line since 1995,
giving almost anyone with a computer and a credit card the chance
to gamble. Americans last year wagered an estimated $1 billion on
line in a form that thrives in a legal twilight zone as advances in
technology have outpaced the law.
</P>
<P>
   These cybercasinos are based offshore, many of them on Caribbean
islands, because gambling in the United States requires specific
legal permission. On-line casinos blur those legal boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Is it illegal for a woman in Ohio, for instance, to place a bet
with a cybercasino in Antigua? Does the betting occur in Ohio or in
Antigua?
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, has introduced a bill that
would prohibit on-line gambling by giving judges the power to shut
down Internet providers who give Web sites to cybercasinos.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved the measure last year 90 to 9, but it did
not come to a vote in the House of Representatives before Congress
adjourned. The bill is expected to come to the Senate floor again
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee's
subcommittee on technology, said he thought that Internet gambling
already violated the law against sports betting, which, although
permitted in Las Vegas, was banned under the Federal Wire Act of
1961. But the law does not address nonsports betting.
</P>
<P>
   And the 1961 measure could eventually be irrelevant if satellite
transmission or radio waves replace telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   For now, some states have taken separate approaches, none of
them altogether effective. Illinois and Louisiana have banned
Internet gambling. Minnesota is studying whether on-line wagering
could be regulated and licensed. And Missouri has taken court
action against on-line gambling providers.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Nixon, the Attorney General of Missouri, has filed a Federal
suit in Kansas City against the Coeur D'Alene Indian tribe in
Idaho, contending that the tribe's lottery and bingo Web site
violates Missouri's consumer laws, which prohibit the sale of
illegal goods or services.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe, meanwhile, contends that the wagering is legal
because it is based in a sovereign American Indian nation, where
wagering is permitted.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri also filed suit against a Pennsylvania man for running
an Internet gambling site. The man pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor
charge last year and was fined $27,000.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutions of Internet gambling remain rarer than a poker
hand of four aces. Sue Schneider, who publishes an on-line magazine
on computer gambling, Interactive Gaming News, said it would be
impossible to stop people from wagering over the Internet. She said
that more than 500 sites offered gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she said, states and the Federal Government should
regulate the industry. Australia, she noted, has recently started
to license on-line casinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could regulate them just like you regulate any land-based
gambling operation,'' Schneider said.
</P>
<P>
   Dianne Meyer, the publisher of Rolling Good Times On-Line,
another Internet magazine that reports about on-line gambling, said
a prohibition would drive the industry underground. That would
leave consumers with no protection, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an unregulated industry that desperately needs to be
regulated,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But on-line gambling has relatively few defenders. In June, the
National Gambling Impact Study Commission, created by Congress,
called for a ban on Internet gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Most professional sports leagues, as well as the National
Collegiate Athletic Association, have called for the prohibition of
on-line wagering. The Las Vegas casino industry has called for a
ban as well.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Fahrenkopf, the president of the American Gaming
Association, which represents the casino industry, said he scoffed
at the notion that his group's opposition to on-line gambling was
rooted in a fear of competition. He said the industry's chief
concern was that Internet gambling would tarnish all operators of
casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who support the ban, however, acknowledge that
enforcement could be difficult. And the Internet providers have
chafed at being forced to act as a sheriff expected to keep outlaws
out of a virtual Dodge City.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging those concerns, the Kyl measure would relieve
Internet providers of the responsibility to block on-line casinos
in two instances: if it was technologically impossible to block
access or if it was prohibitively burdensome to do so.
</P>
<P>
   While operators tend to be mysterious, surveys have gathered
some information about users. On-line gamblers tend to be white men
ages 20 to 40, often wagering on sports, said Kevin O'Neill, a
spokesman for the Council on Compulsive Gambling of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Sports betting is popular on the Internet, he said, ``because
everybody knows the outcome of a game _ you can't cheat on that.''
</P>
<P>
   On-line casinos typically set up accounts with customers that
debit a credit card. Losses are charged to the card, while winnings
are tallied as a credit.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, it has been relatively easy for on-line casinos to
open for business. Nearly two dozen of them are based in Antigua,
where a license can be bought for $100,000 or less, and there are
no taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on gambling say on-line wagering removes most of the
social barriers that inhibit gambling. There is no travel. And it
can be done in private at home, so no one else has to know about
it.
</P>
<P>
   Lacey, the architect who lost $60,000 to Internet gambling, said
he started wagering on his computer as a way to forget off-line
frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found it as a means of escaping life's problems,'' he said.
``I was in a bad marriage. And I had the early stages of
Parkinson's.''
</P>
<P>
   The gambling problem, he said, is a much fiercer foe than his
health problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Parkinson's, I can control that with medication,'' he
said. ``That gambling, that's a harder thing to control.''

<P>
   Click on Gucci.com and what do you get? A Web site under
construction. Point that browser toward Prada.com? There is a
picture of a smoldering model, but no handbags are available for
purchase. Perhaps, you think, a dress from Christian Dior.com? Oh,
you crazy fool-for-fashion you.
</P>
<P>
   While bookshops blossom and drugstores multiply, luxury vendors
have only tiptoed into the on-line space, which they perceive as a
little too low rent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web works well for standardized products, but with fashion
you reinvent the product every six months, with new cuts and new
fabrics that look different in different lights,'' says Godo
Kraemer, the director of international public relations for Hugo
Boss, summing up the Zeitgeist of the elite houses.
</P>
<P>
   The sleek suit maker whose creations cost as much as $1,200 at
stores like Saks Fifth Avenue has plans for an informational site
only.
</P>
<P>
   And although merchants certainly will not acknowledge it, there
is also the Wichita (as in Kansas) problem. A large part of the
cost of any luxury item is its exclusive image.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perceived lack of demand drives supply,'' said Mike May, who
follows the sector for Jupiter Communications, the Web research
company. ``The reason a Prada bag costs $450 is that you can only
get it at a very few exclusive shops. If anybody in the world could
buy a Prada bag, the name would lose some of its cachet.''
</P>
<P>
   But members of the pashmina shawl set should not despair. The
lures for luxury's prime-time players to join the Web rush are
great. For one thing, counterfeit merchandise being sold on the Web
is a growing problem, and what better way to frustrate virtual
swindlers than to offer the merchandise through an official site.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is also improving. Pictures of clothing on the Web
can lack texture and true color, but software advances will make it
possible this fall to see the weave of the Irish cable sweater
undulate in its full sumptuousness.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the alluring fact that the average Web user has
twice the income of the average American. Top style houses are
watching closely and have noticed that there are customers blithely
willing to plunk down $30,000 for diamond stud earrings or $15,000
for a Queen Anne dresser at an auction site.
</P>
<P>
   Many are now investigating how to exploit the medium without
angering the traditional retailers that are their biggest buyers.
One option may be to design clothing lines to be sold only on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, as Gucci and Hugo Boss dally, the Web is
beginning to fill with lesser-known, but not lesser-cost, purveyors
of couture, art and jewelry. People who want to shop for luxury
goods now will probably end up at a site that is category specific.
Everything from diamonds to antique automobiles has its own
peddler.
</P>
<P>
   Nextmonet.com, for example, hopes to lead well-compensated
professionals to their inner art collector. Most of its portfolio
is from mid-career artists who are ``underexposed,'' with works
costing $2,000 to $7,000.
</P>
<P>
   Myrna Nickelsen, the site's chief executive and co-founder,
describes her customers as ``people who drive BMWs and are ready to
graduate from posters but know nothing about art.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the site are not only introduced to artists and
their works but are offered art history lessons and industry
gossip.
</P>
<P>
   The other type of luxury site is a loosely knit front for a
dozen or more upscale retailers. Bestselections.com is essentially
a mall with a store roster that reads like a shopping diary for the
international jet set.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers at this site can browse by antique jewelry selected by
Catherine Prevost, proprietor of a chic shop in the Knightsbridge
section of London, or order million-thread count sheets from
Roberta East Linens in East Hampton, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Styleclick.com offers a similar conglomeration-of-brands
approach, but instead of retailers it features wares from
manufacturers like Kenneth Cole, Anne Klein II and Trussardi
Leather.
</P>
<P>
   A word of warning: such mix-and-match sites offer a limited
amount of merchandise from their vendors, and often the poorer
selection at that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty-five percent of our purchases are $500 or more,'' brags
Maurizio Vecchione, Styleclick's chief executive. Maybe, but plenty
of embroidered T-shirts for $32 can be had at his site as well.
Similarly, at Bagley Home, a farm antiques shop on
Bestselections.com, it is easier to find chenille bunnies and
beeswax candles than 18th-century armoires.
</P>
<P>
   Luxuryfinder.com, which is being introduced by the New York
social fixtures James Finkelstein and Pamela Gross this fall, aims
at a more ambitious model: a luxury portal that is the equivalent
of a social secretary for the wired billionaire set.
</P>
<P>
   The site will, of course, offer necessities like a Ghurka laptop
carrying case for $1,295 and a bottle of Chateau Lafite at $10,000.
Luxuryfinder.com, by the way, will eschew more common brands like
Coach Leather, which Gross called ``too low end.''
</P>
<P>
   But Luxuryfinder will provide services like a calendar of
society events and tips by Lord Charles Spencer-Churchill, a
grandson of Consuela Vanderbilt, on how to behave like a British
aristocrat.
</P>
<P>
   Such ambitious competitors have already shaken a few of luxury's
big names out of their ennui. The luxury conglomerate LVMH Moet
Hennessy Louis Vuitton S.A., which owns couture houses like
Christian Dior and Givenchy, plans to test the Web waters.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Sephora.com, the international cosmetics and beauty
retailer, which is 80 percent owned by LVMH, will go live. The rest
of the company's brands will follow. LVMH, which once saw the Web
as a threat, now sees it as a matter of survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think everyone knows for sure how big the market is,
but the demographics are clear, the young affluent and aspiring
affluent customer are already there,'' said Myron Ullman, LVMH's
group managing director. ``So we will be, too.''

 &HT;    Blurring fact and fiction
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ ``Sometimes I just want to pop that smarmy
Alexander Hamilton right in the nose. `Calculate the interest on
THIS, Mr. Treasury Secretary.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Jefferson jabbed at the air in a good approximation of a
right to the jaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't twist your wig, Tom,'' I advised. ``Hamilton will get
his someday. I have this feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   He sighed and kept walking.
</P>
<P>
   OK, you caught me. That didn't happen. I am a little younger
than 200 years old _ thank you for noticing _ but something like
that could have happened to someone. Hamilton knew how to get
someone's goat.
</P>
<P>
   In real life, I didn't have the pleasure of hanging out with
Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   In real life, Edmund Morris didn't have the pleasure of hanging
out with a young Ronald Reagan, either. Yet Morris, the official
biographer of Reagan, did write, in first person, about brushing
against The Gipper in 1926 when he was only a mere Gipplet. And
when Morris was still about 14 years shy of being born.
</P>
<P>
   Morris tells of several other encounters between the young
Reagan and his fictional self in his new book. This sounds just a
little strange for a biography, stacked with other biographies in
the part of the library we laughingly call ``nonfiction.''
</P>
<P>
   The weird thing is that Morris enjoyed an advantage most
presidential biographers only dream about _ he got to hang out with
his subject. Still, he had to resort to fictions to flesh him out.
Why?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe because he had been spoiled. Morris landed the Reagan
biography job because he had written a vivid, Pulitzer
Prize-winning portrait of Teddy Roosevelt. Without meeting
Roosevelt, he made him feel alive and intelligible. I came away
from the book with the artfully constructed illusion that I knew
TR. (That's not a narrative device. I really did read the book.)
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt helps a biographer along. He was more than articulate,
he was what journalists admiringly term A Quote Machine.
</P>
<P>
   He labeled the muckraker, boasted of being ``as strong as a bull
moose'' and spoke softly and carried a big stick. He scolded the
``malefactors of great wealth,'' deplored the ``lunatic fringe,''
and promised ``a square deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The man hardly stopped for lunch. A biographer is left running
breathlessly behind him, scooping up the best and most vivid of his
endless explanations and amplifications of himself, his ideas, and
his many, many enthusiasms.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, a living Reagan is a harder subject than a dead
Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   People who adore Reagan's politics and were charmed by his
manner nonetheless found him in person to be baffling, distant and
strangely uninvolved with folks around him.
</P>
<P>
   Like many an actor, he was at his best viewed at a distance. At
a place where his hair color didn't look so strange. Where the
makeup didn't seem so stagy. Where the stage's chalk marks weren't
so apparent and the cue cards unseen. The sixth time he cocked his
head and dabbed at his eye, one appreciated the art of real pro
rather than the emotions of a real person.
</P>
<P>
   Or that's what I thought. I only saw him once (in real life, not
as a narrative device). He had an amazing way of looking through
everyone in the room and directly into the television cameras in
the back row.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing the video was vastly superior to being there. I felt like
I had visited Disney's Hall of Presidents.
</P>
<P>
   A dead Roosevelt spoke forcefully and directly. A live Reagan
changed the subject with a quip. A dead Roosevelt was the stuff of
movies. A live Reagan was the staff of movies. Roosevelt had a way
of filling a room. Reagan had a way of filling the screen.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Morris was driven to extreme measures. I suspect the
media-intense politics of our age is going to be rough going for
other biographers. Even those who were on the scene. Even those who
get to view all the video.
</P>
<P>
   Morris may not be the last writer reduced to pretending he
really knew what was behind the screen. Media Age politics probably
will drive others to even stranger devices.

 &HT;    Toledo airport puts fun back in flying
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOLEDO EXPRESS AIRPORT, Ohio _ Stand-up comedians and hapless
politicians love to crack bad jokes about Toledo. They don't do it
to be mean, they do it to be funny _ but they're not. They feel
safe asking dumb questions like, ``How many Toledoans does it take
to screw in a light bulb?'' because they figure everybody in the
audience is from somewhere else. Like all of northwest Ohio is
still crawling out from under the glacier and trying to figure out
how the wheel works.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's time for the jokes to stop, because things are pretty
cool around here. Toledo has a downtown that is showing signs of
coming back to life in spite of the contemporary curse of all
cities _ sprawling look-alike malls _ and it even has a river
running through it.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo has an airport, too. It's not exactly LAX or Atlanta's
Hartsfield, but most of us who use it regularly count that as a
real blessing. We have a
</P>
<P>
   couple of jetways and an escalator, and the only line I've ever
waited in at security was behind a lady with a bag of apples that
got away from her and wobbled
</P>
<P>
   through the x-ray machine, one Granny Smith at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers don't fly into Toledo Express to connect with British
Airways to London or a nonstop to Okinawa. The way I figure it,
three kinds of folks
</P>
<P>
   frequent the Toledo airport: those who live here and are going
somewhere, those who have been somewhere and are coming home, and
those who come just to watch the airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo Express has no trams, no moving sidewalks, and best of
all, no parking garage. There is no multilevel facility with a cute
name like Miami
</P>
<P>
   International's ``Flamingo Garage'' nor are there signs
reminding the visitor he has just left his pickup in Section 3EEE,
Level 2, Aisle 8, Section 27-A,
</P>
<P>
   Green _ a system devised by port authorities to trick the unwary
motorist into believing he's going to be able to locate his truck
in less time than it takes to fly to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Once inside the terminal, nothing is more than a three minute
walk from anything else, and the airport bar is centrally located _
just in case. Never have I sat on an airplane that lingered on
Toledo's ramp for 30 minutes waiting for a gate, or had the captain
announce we were 23rd in line for takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo's airport is fun _ just like airports used to be. The
only thing missing is a restaurant. There's one there, but I don`t
think anyone eats in it. And that's too bad because I remember the
days when airports boasted some really fine dining. Even folks who
weren't going anywhere would go there just
</P>
<P>
   for the food. Watching airplanes was a bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's old airport, the one back in the '50s that looked like
a WW2 Quonset hut, had a restaurant that served up shrimp remoulade
and pecan pie that folks would drive all the way across town for.
Chicago's Midway Airport had a dining room that looked like
something straight out of a Bogart/Bacall movie. Mysterious men in
cufflinks and ladies with hats that covered one eye, ate there
between planes bound for exotic places. And at Louisville's
Standiford Airport, the restaurant served up a fried chicken dinner
that drew the city's Sunday after-church group.
</P>
<P>
   For me, Toledo's airport is the best of two worlds. I can take
life easy in the village I call home, insulated from the hurry-up,
push 'em around world on the outside, but when the need for speed
overwhelms me, it's a 37-minute drive on the turnpike to Toledo
Express. In five minutes I can park, unload my bags
</P>
<P>
   and be standing in front of the ticket counter, flashing my
passport and promising the agent that my suitcase has not left my
sight since I packed it.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who's tried it lately knows that air travel is no longer
fun. Airports are zoos and airline employees act like they've
forgotten who's paying their salaries. If it weren't for Toledo
Express, I think I'd give all of my business to Amtrak.

 &HT;    Cooperation, preservation, public investment _ all paid off
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Crossing the Platte River on foot, I was reminded
foggily, and without tune, of a line from some song _ some guy
writing about coming home ``to a place he'd never been before.''
That guy ... That guy...
</P>
<P>
   Oh. John Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Ahem. How oddly, and perfectly, the words fit. This was my first
time across the Platte on foot. That's a personal news bulletin.
I'm a Denver native. I've crossed the Platte countless times _ on
wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, this was a place to which I'd not been:
</P>
<P>
   Hike-bike paths along a once-blighted creek and railroad tracks,
though a one-time hobo junction that's now a beaming nightlife
district, on the outskirts of a downtown hub that in this decade
has cut a 70 percent office vacancy rate in half.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion for the walk was a gathering of editorial writers
from across the nation, with urban revitalization as a theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was this place like before?'' newcomers asked me about
the 16th Street Mall and the Lower Downtown _ Lo Do _ entertainment
district. My answer: ``I don't know. I never came down here.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while I was growing up, unless you were a sack of grain
or a transient with a bed pack, or had a railroad or warehouse job,
the Platte Valley now teeming with life was no place for you.
</P>
<P>
   How did it turn around? Three key ingredients: metro
cooperation, historic preservation, public investment. With those
three ingredients, private enterprise got interested big-time. But
``public'' preceded ``private,'' and forever it shall.
</P>
<P>
   Two metro votes _ involving six counties _helped paved the way
for the downtown boom. First, voters approved a 1-cent sales tax
increment for a Scientific and Cultural Facilities District.
Second, voters approved a sales-tax hike to build a stadium _ Coors
Field _ for major league baseball.
</P>
<P>
   To the inner cities that give them life, suburbs can be
bloodsucking parasites. But Denver has demonstrated how joint
investment and cooperation can benefit the whole region.
</P>
<P>
   For the city, one crucial tack was to see historic buildings as
assets and to control development within that framework. The
warehouse district along Wazee and Wynkoop streets, infamous when I
was a kid, was the heart of the early city. The building of Coors
Field nearby spawned an explosion of lofts, restaurants and
microbreweries in once-dead warehouses and rail stations.
</P>
<P>
   Use your assets
</P>
<P>
   This is all easy for Denver, you say. How many cities have major
league ball to dazzle developers? True. But any city has assets at
its heart _ a river, a historic district, a depot _ that can be
more than eyesores.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, any city has assets that it could let decay if it
doesn't have the guts to confront the problem, to improve
infrastructure in its heart, rather than surrender to suburban
flight and do-nothing fiscal impulses.
</P>
<P>
   Denver was in the midst of a brutal recession when former Mayor
Federico Pena went to the voters with a bond issue to restore the
Platte district, with green space, trails and more.
</P>
<P>
   Current Mayor Wellington Webb observes that going to property
owners for a tax increment during a horrific downturn sounds crazy.
But Webb said that a bond issue is a statement about the future,
not the present, and Denver had confidence in its future.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor cannot be ignored: neighborhoods. Denver can't
claim having wiped out neighborhood blight. But it did confront
blight and flight in key areas _ like the Highlands Neighborhood,
the city's oldest, just across the Platte from Lower Downtown. This
included aggressive use of federal aid for housing rehabilitation
with an eye to historic flavor. It also included better parks.
</P>
<P>
   Now Highlands' turnaround is as striking as the downtown on its
front porch. I'd compare it to the Lo Do of my youth, but we never
met.
</P>
<P>
   John Young's column appears Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday.

 &HT;    New hand-held games are made for little kids
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Hand-held electronic games are popular with teens
and preteens, but they can be frustrating for smaller children. Big
brothers and sisters hardly ever let the little ones play, and when
they do the games may be too difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro Games added eight games to its hand-held game line this
year, including six games designed to be played by players 8 years
old or younger. Hand-held games, which are produced by several
companies, are available at most toy and discount stores.
</P>
<P>
   Among Hasbro's new games for kids are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Pooh Flickering Fireflies, ages 3 to 5: Talking fireflies lead
players on a chase through the 100 Acre Wood of the popular Winnie
the Pooh series. The game automatically adjusts to three skill
levels and features four games. Suggested price: $14.99.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ballzerko, ages 5 and older: This is an electronic pinball
game with an electronic voice, lights, music and sounds for three
fast-paced activities. Suggested price: $19.99.
</P>
<P>
   _ Operation: The portable, electronic version of the classic
board game lets players conduct ``operations'' and remove parts
like ``butterflies in the stomach'' from their imaginary patients.
The game has a time to let players race against the clock.
Suggested price: $17.99.
</P>
<P>
   _ Simon, ages 7 to adult: The original version of this game was
hot in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The game plays a series of four lights and accompanying tones,
and players try to repeat the pattern by touching four colored
buttons in the proper order. Hasbro's portable version has four
skill levels and three ways to play. Suggested price: $7.99.
</P>
<P>
   The other new hand-held games in the Hasbro line this year are
Frogger, Bop It Extreme, Trivial Pursuit NFL Edition and Trivial
Pursuit NASCAR Edition.

 &HT;    Windows challengers moving into spotlight
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The battle over which company will control the desktop
computer _ a battle many experts have long believed Microsoft
already won _ is about to heat up again. Many new challengers are
vying to replace Microsoft's Windows operating system. Read about
these systems and their chances for victory in the October issue of
PC World.
</P>
<P>
   Among the operating systems covered are BeOS 4.5 and Linux. The
magazine also takes a close look at the upcoming versions of
Windows, scheduled for release next year.
</P>
<P>
   It's list time again, and some of Atlanta's top entrepreneurs
have made Digitalsouth magazine's top high-tech entrepreneurs.
Topping the list in the October issue is Bert Ellis Jr., the
45-year-old chairman and chief executive of iXL Enterprises. Other
Atlantans on the list are WebMD founder Jeff Arnold, MindSpring
founder Charles Brewer and Media Metrix Vice Chairman Jeff Levy.
</P>
<P>
   ON CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has a great deal for Mac users.
</P>
<P>
   The company released its popular Word writing program in a new
package for iMac and iBook users. Called Word 98 Special Edition,
the package includes thousands of new clip art images and 100 new
greeting card templates, as well as Microsoft's free Web browser
and e-mail programs.
</P>
<P>
   The package retails for $99, about $200 less than previously
released versions of Word 98.
</P>
<P>
   First it was in movie theaters, then on computer screens. Now
you can experience George Lucas' ``Phantom Menace'' on Sony
PlayStation. LucasArts Entertainment has released a video game
based on the latest ``Star Wars'' movie.
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE
</P>
<P>
   The latest news organization to join the Year 2000 bandwagon is
the Public Broadcasting System.
</P>
<P>
   Its member stations have run a series of stories about the
millennium bug and the potential problems it may cause. You can
read transcripts of these stories, view video clips from them and
research general information about Y2K at a special site PBS has
set up.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find the site at www.pbs.org/y2kontarget/.

 &HT;    Mechanical nose sniffs out trouble
 &HT;    By Laura A. Bischoff
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAIRBORN, Ohio _ It may not take much to figure out that hog
manure stinks, but Wright State University Assistant Professor
Ricardo Guiterrez-Osuna has an electronic nose that objectively and
precisely measures such odors.
</P>
<P>
   Guiterrez, 31, began working on the electronic nose project as a
graduate student at North Carolina State University in 1996. The
National Pork Producers Association helped fund the project because
``they wanted a device to give an objective sense of smell,''
Guiterrez said.
</P>
<P>
   The human nose is roughly 1,000 times more sensitive but human
olfactory abilities adapt to smells after a while, said Guiterrez.
So a hog farmer isn't as sensitive to the manure smell or a chef
doesn't smell cooking food as strongly after being in the kitchen
awhile, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Guiterrez brought the electronic nose project to Wright State a
year ago when he was appointed to the computer science and
engineering department.
</P>
<P>
   The electronic nose can be used to measure food or beverage
quality by sniffing each product as it rolls off the manufacturing
line, diagnose infections by sniffing bacteria cultures and
eventually detect mustard gas or other hazardous compounds used in
warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Research on electronic noses originated in England in the 1980s
but only a handful of scientists in the United States are working
on such projects, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The machine consists of a power supply, pump, five valves,
electronic circuit boards and chamber with 16 tin oxide sensors. It
sits on a small sheet of particle board and is hooked up to a
laptop computer. Guiterrez is able to fit it into a plastic
container about the size of a toy box when using it outside of his
lab.
</P>
<P>
   To demonstrate the nose, Guiterrez sprinkles cinnamon into a jar
with a plastic tube sticking out of the lid. He plugs the tube into
a valve on the nose. The air in the cinnamon jar is pumped through
the machine. The surfaces of the 16 sensors react, changing the
conductivity and sending a signal to the laptop. The 16 colored
lines move from straight to up and down on the screen into a
distinct pattern that represents cinnamon's fingerprint. The more
times the machine smells, the better the recognition pattern
becomes.
</P>
<P>
   A 60-second whiff by the device's 16 sensors results in 900
measurements. Guiterrez's computer program uses mathematical
calculations to compress that data down to two measurements that
can be plotted using linear algebra. The program is so precise that
the differences between the smells of Coke and Pepsi can be easily
plotted _ an experiment Guiterrez conducted as part of his doctoral
dissertation.
</P>
<P>
   Guiterrez said he sees the device eventually being used to
control emissions into the environment and helping doctors diagnose
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not interested in making money off it right now. I'm
interested in the research and science of it,'' he said.

 &HT;    Web cam watchers can see a lot
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Web cams, one guesses, are a lot like a NASCAR race:
People watch to see something interesting happen.
</P>
<P>
   With a half-day race, it might be a wreck. With Web cams, the
most popular of which broadcasts live shots of a woman's bedroom,
it's nudity.
</P>
<P>
   The October issue of Yahoo Internet Life magazine profiles the
33-year-old woman behind Anacam.com. Since 1997, when Ana put a
camera in her bedroom and broadcast images of her and her boyfriend
having sex, Anacam.com has attracted more and more visitors. She
estimates receiving up to 22,000 viewers every day.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet Life issue also includes lists of Web cameras that
aren't trained on people. One site, www.windows2000.com, is a
compilation of Web cameras divided by state. At www.earthcam.com,
things are organized by subject: traffic cameras, weather cameras,
scenic cameras, and weird and bizarre cameras.
</P>
<P>
   The new issue also lists one Web site serving a niche market:
wired truckers. The site, www.drivernet.com, lists each of its 375
e-mail terminals at truck stops in the continental United States.
The service is free, and it gives truckers a free e-mail address to
use while on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Internet Life also examines free Internet connections. Companies
like Microworkz, AltaVista and NetZero offer free connections to
anyone willing to sift through advertising. All you America Online
users might be thinking, ``Hey, I'm already sifting through ads,
and I'm paying $21.95 a month for it.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The free ISP service requires you to download software and
register. Once enrolled, a user sees advertisements on his or her
PC screen the whole time they're on the already-ad-riddled
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Europe, the services apparently are selling well. But
Americans have been less likely to be moved to save $10 to $20 a
month while seeing even more online advertising.
</P>
<P>
   _ The magazine also helps you tell the difference between a bad
e-mailer and a good one. A good e-mailer sends you only the files
you asked for. A bad e-mailer sends you the ``Best Net Jokes of
1998'' with a Microsoft Word virus attached. A bad e-mailer catches
up by writing a simple, ``Hi ... what's up? Write me when you have
a chance.'' A bad e-mailer sends ``a tacky e-mail greeting showing
a) a furry white kitten, b) a hot-air balloon, and c) a kitten in a
hot-air balloon.''
</P>
<P>
   RING OUT THE MILLENNIUM AT TIMES SQUARE SITE
</P>
<P>
   If fear of the Y2K bug is keeping you landlocked this New Year's
Eve and you don't feel like driving to New York, the Internet might
be the next best thing.
</P>
<P>
   A site, www.timessquare.com/, which was scheduled to open last
week, hopes to be the gathering place for people who can't make it
to Times Square and can't watch the ball drop on television.
</P>
<P>
   The site will broadcast the New Year's Eve celebration,
including the lowering of the ball. In the spring, the site will
become TimesSquareAlive.com, an entertainment and information site.
</P>
<P>
   The site is expected to feature online auctions, ticket sales
and Times Square merchandise. Earthcam.com will place cameras at
different points on Times Square and broadcast the images on the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers also hope to:
</P>
<P>
   _ Broadcast the New Year's Eve midnight celebrations in Paris,
London, Tokyo and Cairo, Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   _ Offer a contest asking the question, ``What are you planning
to do in the last 60 seconds of the millennium?'' Prizes include
New Year's Eve travel packages.
</P>
<P>
   _ Offer the ability to chat and message during the New Year's
Eve celebration. Some messages will be broadcast on the big video
screens in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   BUYING PROTECTION FOR ONLINE PURCHASES
</P>
<P>
   Interested in taking advantage of the price and convenience of
Internet shopping but still leery about buying something you
haven't touched? A company, WebAssured.com, is offering purchase
protection for merchants and shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   The company, located at www.webassured.com, is offering what it
claims is the Internet's first online purchase-protection program.
The protection offer is underwritten by Lloyd's of London.
</P>
<P>
   The site includes places where people can make laudatory
comments about online retailers as well as post warnings about
shady companies.

 &HT;    When HTML fails, there's always solitaire
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Robert Rogers e-mails me with an interesting computer
problem. The reason it is interesting, incidentally, is because (1)
It might happen to you and (2) I happen to know the answer. I get a
lot of questions that aren't of much interest, because although (1)
It might happen to you, (2) I don't have a clue about how to fix
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a Gateway G6-300 computer, equipped with Windows 98 and
the Word 97 word processor,'' Mr. Rogers writes. ``My problem stems
from opening e-mail and other text from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``By opening it, I mean that sometimes I save e-mail news
articles and other information in my computer. Sometimes, it is a
hassle trying to open some of this information, and sometimes, the
documents will not open at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I save a file is that I go to the File function on the
toolbar, and to Save As on the dropdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the save window, I save in `My Documents' and as HTML
files. The files save, but when I try to open them with Word 97, a
lot of them won't open. Am I doing something wrong, or is there a
better way of saving files off the Internet?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, Mr. Rogers, the only surprise here is that any of them
open. As best I recall, an HTML reader was an add-on feature for
early versions of Word 97. You had to download it, and it would
attach itself to the word processor. Otherwise, Word 97 would be
unlikely to open any HTML file.
</P>
<P>
   HTML, of course, is hypertext code, the simple language with
which Web sites are written.
</P>
<P>
   All you need do is save the file as text instead of HTML. Then
you should be able to open it as a text file.
</P>
<P>
   You can also, obviously, open an HTML file with the browser that
saved it. Just use the Open command in the File menu.
</P>
<P>
   I am getting more and more message attachments couched in HTML.
It's really an aggravation, because Lotus Notes, perhaps the most
misbegotten program ever inflicted upon an unsuspecting public in
the last few years, won't read HTML. For that matter, I don't
believe the e-mail program I use at home _ Eudora _ reads it
either. Most of these messages, I imagine, come from folks using
Navigator or Explorer to send messages.
</P>
<P>
   I'm still getting the occasional epistle regarding solitaire.
</P>
<P>
   Remember Bunny? She's the lady who told me you haven't lived
until you've run up a big score turning one card at a time. I don't
remember what that score was, but Joy Cawley does.
</P>
<P>
   Joy asks me to tell Bunny that ``I play solitaire against the
clock with the three-card turnover and my best score to date is
8,704 in 87 seconds. She should definitely give it a try.''
</P>
<P>
   I've never played one-card turnover solitaire, which sounds kind
of like shooting fish in a barrel, but neither do I play against
the clock or watch the score. I have other things to do for
excitement, such as remembering the way to work every morning. I
play solitaire to relax and contemplate the nature of the universe
and the question of why, after all, frogs weren't given wings to
avoid all that wear and tear on their posteriors.

 &HT;    On health Web sites, discrepancies can be as common as answers
 &HT;    By Heather Cocks
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Ask the health experts at Johns Hopkins
University's Intelihealth Web site, and they'll say taking vitamins
isn't widely regarded as a way to treat or control Hepatitis C.
</P>
<P>
   But surf on over to Flash Gordon, M.D., the most prolific health
guru at www.webmd.com, and he'll tell you different. Gordon singles
out Vitamins C and E, as well as flaxseed oil, as the diet
supplements doctors think can help Hepatitis C patients.
</P>
<P>
   Such discrepancies prove fairly common among health-related Web
sites. The Johns Hopkins team warns osteoporosis sufferers against
drinking alcohol, but the team at the Mayo Clinic's Web site claims
alcohol in moderation is acceptable for those with the bone
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Internet health sites have come under scrutiny in recent months
from health professionals who fear that in the lucrative online
arena, the business-minded entrepreneurs behind the Web sites could
end up pledging allegiance to advertisers rather than the
Hippocratic Oath. Some critics also claim that, by relying on
medical Web sites, consumers risk making a self-diagnosis based on
biased or unreliable information.
</P>
<P>
   To evaluate the consistency _ or dissimilarities _ of medical
advice being dispensed online, an Austin American-Statesman
reporter tried posing eight health questions to six Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The only common thread? Silence.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with an urgent medical query won't have much luck with
the online experts. None of the sites that offered ``ask the
experts'' sections produced any response over an 11-day period _
not surprising, because each site cautions that the high number of
questions received means no guarantee of an answer.
</P>
<P>
   Those who seek help with their own detailed scenarios may also
strike out. Broad questions are most likely to be answered,
according to most sites _ with the exception of The Mayo Clinic
site, www.mayohealth.org, and the Johns Hopkins site at
www.intelihealth.com, both of which fielded very case-specific
queries.
</P>
<P>
   But the answers don't always come from practicing physicians.
The Intelihealth site's ``Ask the Doc'' segment instead featured
answers from professors and researchers at Johns Hopkins.
Drkoop.com's Dr. Nancy Snyderman, is a professor with training in
ear, nose and throat conditions, but makes a living as a television
correspondent.
</P>
<P>
   Feature articles and resource material can provide more answers.
</P>
<P>
   Most online health information cites university hers,
national associations and medical journals as primary sources. Two
Austin-based sites, drkoop.com and healthanswers.com, produced
seemingly comprehensive profiles of disease symptoms, causes,
treatments and symptoms _ but without attributing that information
to any particular source.
</P>
<P>
   That is part of what's drawn criticism from the medical
community, and the sites seem to be on the defensive. Each article
ends with a small-text disclaimer explaining that the information
is no substitute for a doctor's diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   Drkoop.com flashes a lengthy disclaimer the first time users try
to access information about prescription medication. The disclaimer
states that the site makes every attempt to guarantee the accuracy
of the information, which comes from an independent medical
researcher.
</P>
<P>
   Of the six sites visited, none appeared guilty of bowing to its
sponsors, another criticism of health sites. An ad for Primatene
Mist, an oral inhaler for asthma sufferers, graced the top of the
Mayo Clinic's Web page _ but a quick search turned up the site's
explanatory document on asthma, where its doctors advised patients
against reliance on inhalers.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of accessibility of information, investigating major
diseases or medical conditions is relatively simple. All the sites
categorized information about topics such as AIDS, cancer, diabetes
and women's health into their own sections, offering links to
medical news, question-and-answer archives, journals and chat
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Culling information for rarer or lesser-known conditions proves
trickier. Healthanswers.com turns up information about spina bifida
only if users look for it under the birth defect's other name,
myelomeningocele.
</P>
<P>
   On site-wide searches for spina bifida, Healthanswers.com and
others return more coherent documents with better explanations of
treatments and symptoms. But lists of those more helpful pieces are
also peppered with more complicated reference material such as the
Merriam-Webster Medical Dictionary, where each definition is
littered with medical lingo that the average person may find tough
to digest.
</P>
<P>
   Information about prescription drugs can be just as problematic.
To read about the obesity drug Meridia, well-known thanks to a
flood of television and print advertisements, drkoop.com users have
to brush up on their clinical vocabulary to understand the
potential drug interactions.
</P>
<P>
   Meridia ``should not be taken if you have taken a monoamine
oxidase inhibitor,'' the article warns, ``such as isocarboxazid,
tranylcypromine or phenelzine.''

 &HT;    Health sites are hits - but are they reliable?By Andrew Park
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Looking on the Internet for health information?
You may get more than you expect.
</P>
<P>
   Type in the word ``allergy'' at a health Web site, for example,
and in one screen you can get a wealth of information and
advertising, all seamlessly linked together and personalized for
you. Click here for allergy news, there for how to treat them, over
here for a new drug, here to join a support group, here to buy some
Sudafed.
</P>
<P>
   Not quite an electronic house call but more than just a medical
library, the Internet may be the ultimate tool to disseminate
information about illnesses to the masses.
</P>
<P>
   But should you bet your health on Web site advice?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   While the popularity of online health sites is growing steadily,
so is criticism about them. Some experts warn that they can be
riddled with problems, such as unethical advertising, conflicts of
interest or simply bad advice.
</P>
<P>
   Some, including the medical profession's governing body, the
American Medical Association, are suggesting that online health
sites should be held to medicine's standards of trustworthiness.
</P>
<P>
   Leading health Web sites acknowledge that establishing
credibility is one of their toughest challenges, but they say that
consumers hold them to high standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we do, it's all about establishing that trusted
relationship in the online world,'' said Don Hackett, chief
executive of Austin's drkoop.com, the most popular health-related
site on the Internet, attracting an estimated 3.5 million visitors
a month. ``In the online world ... all the information glows with
the same intensity, whether it's accurate or not.''
</P>
<P>
   But some say the industry should establish policies for ensuring
accuracy and disclosing the conflicts of interest that come along
with mixing content and commerce, the lifeblood of most Internet
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one of those ventures has a profit motive, so the
information is always going to be suspect to profiteering,'' said
Eric Weidmann, an Austin physician who occasionally reviews
health-related Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Weidmann is a proponent of patients' use of the Web to find
health information and support. But like others, he points out that
because most Web sites are businesses that depend on profits, they
are ``suspect to reliability and motive.''
</P>
<P>
   CREDIBILITY CONCERNS
</P>
<P>
   For an idea of what's driving some of the medical profession's
concern about health Web sites, hit the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes at most health Web sites, you won't find many
doctors _ or few people with any medical training, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the online health sites are typically operated by
entrepreneurs, former health-care executives, techies and
journalists, bringing together content from a variety of sources
while using their own and others' personal experience to dispense
advice.
</P>
<P>
   At drkoop.com, for instance, co-founder and namesake C. Everett
Koop, the former U.S. surgeon general, has little to do with the
daily operation of the drkoop.com, though his name and reputation
lend credibility to the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had perceived that Dr. Koop had a personal interest in
making sure this was credible information, so we jumped on the
bandwagon to allow our patients to have another source of
information,'' said David Morehead, president of the Scott &AMP; White
Health Plan, part of the Temple health-care system that is paying
drkoop.com $40,000 a year for packaged medical content and a place
on its list of preferred hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Search the major consumer health sites today and you might find
inconsistent answers and advice to questions on typical health
problems. One site might suggest taking vitamins is a good way for
treating a strain of hepatitis, for example, while another site
might advise that vitamins do no good.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the advice some Web health sites give is just plain
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   A study in the the August edition of the journal Cancer found
dangerous inaccuracies in cancer data in a sample of 400 health
information sites, nearly half of which had not been subjected to
scientific scrutiny, typically a key step in the publication of
articles in medical journals. The study's author listed only a
handful of sites, including, drkoop.com, that she considered
credible and reliable.
</P>
<P>
   Few people _ if any _ are going to get advice on treating cancer
solely off an Internet site. Most sites, in fact, are careful not
to offer extensive advice for any conditions and to always warn
that their information is not a substitute for a physician's
advice.
</P>
<P>
   But some critics say visitors to almost any health Web site
should beware of what is becoming perhaps the most frequent
criticism of Web sites: potential conflicts of interest. Web
companies' methods of linking information and advertising, some
doctors and medical ethicists say, are rife with the potential for
misrepresentation and bias.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a news report revealed that a women's health Internet
site based in California, WomenFirst, had been paid to promote
brand-name prescription drugs written about regularly in its
articles.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, the AMA recently pointed out that drkoop.com had
not detailed to consumers how C. Everett Koop profited from the
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally, that Web site did not give full disclosure,'' said
Robert Tenery, a Dallas ophthalmologist who sits on the American
Medical Association's Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs,
which is examining online medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were profits being made that I would assume the casual
viewer would not recognize,'' he said. ``For someone who's looking
for important medical points, not reading every line, it would be
difficult to determine there was a conflict of interest there.''
</P>
<P>
   Koop, who lives in New Hampshire, was not available for comment.
Executives at drkoop.com say the site has always fully disclosed
its sponsors, but last month it took steps to further separate
advertising and content on the site and change wording to clarify
the nature of paid partnerships with health-care companies,
including hospitals. The company also killed an arrangement to pay
royalties on commercial activity on the site to Koop, known to many
Americans as a tough, unimpeachable advocate for the public's
health.
</P>
<P>
   Koop, meanwhile, is helping form an industry group that will
create a code of ethics for the e-health industry. Other sites are
already posting their advertising policies, hoping to avoid
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're being extremely oriented towards disclosure
now,'' said Dennis Upah, drkoop.com's chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   GROWING POPULARITY
</P>
<P>
   Chalk it up to dissatisfaction with rushed doctor's visits or
just our growing reliance on the Internet for information: Health
care is one of the hottest topics on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   By some estimates, 25,000 sites on the Internet offer
information on health and medical conditions. Last month, more than
13 million people logged onto Internet health sites, according to a
study released recently by research group PC Data Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a rapid transition where people have a hunger for
medical knowledge, and I think many of us are frustrated with our
ability to provide that with the level of validity that the
patients want,'' said Morehead of the Scott &AMP; White Health Plan.
``I look at it in a sense as an experiment in society as to how
best to provide valid information to help them make up their
minds.''
</P>
<P>
   The entities behind major health sites vary from prestigious
medical centers such as the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota and M.D.
Anderson Cancer Center in Houston to for-profit companies like
drkoop.com and Healthanswers.com in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   (Austin360.com, a sister company to the Austin
American-Statesman, runs health information purchased from a
variety of companies. The Seton HealthCare Network also pays to be
the local sponsor of health content.)
</P>
<P>
   To grow quickly, most commercial sites have built business by
signing up partners, now the established way of expanding your
audience on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Drkoop.com may be the best case study of how to build a
successful commercial health site.
</P>
<P>
   There, partners such as America Online and the GO Network
provide ready audiences of millions of subscribers who want
consumer health information, and they link to health-care sites
from their well-trafficked gateways. With an audience in place,
drugstore chains, insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies and
clinical trials companies rush to sign up as partners and place ads
or sponsorships on the site.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that a site that didn't exist 15 months ago now
has numerous partners promoting it online and off, many of them
paying for the privilege. Local television stations run commercials
for drkoop.com and exchange medical information and health stories
with the site. The maker of Nicorette and Nicoderm, two smoking
cessation products, sponsors the section on ``Tackling Tobacco'' on
drkoop.com. The sponsorships, like those on other sites, are
clearly labeled.
</P>
<P>
   But when about 20 hospitals _ including Scott &AMP; White _ showed
up on drkoop.com's list of preferred ``Community Partners,''
without noting that they had paid to be on the list, the AMA cried
foul. A company spokeswoman said the wording of that page was
changed around Aug. 20.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at drkoop.com say they keep content and advertising
as separate as church and state, won't accept content from
advertisers and routinely turn down advertising from companies they
feel are disreputable. Other sites, such as healthanswers.com,
intelihealth.com and onhealth.com, have similar policies.
</P>
<P>
   The AMA wants sites to go out of their way to delineate paid
advertising and medical information or advice and let consumers
know which is which.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing out there that says that Dr. Koop can't make
money giving advice on a Web site,'' said Tenery. ``That's not the
question. It all goes back to one thing and that's disclosure.''
Major commercial health sites say their content is evaluated by
doctors and noted to show where it came from.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that isn't always the case.
</P>
<P>
   On healthanswers.com, for instance, only the fine print tells
the source of entries in its ``library,'' and there is no mention
of who wrote the content, who reviewed it or when it was updated.
The information is purchased from the medical encyclopedia adam.com
and reviewed by doctors there, company officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, on drkoop.com, pages about such conditions as asthma,
endometriosis and HIV are credited only to the company and do not
detail who wrote or reviewed them. The company says it is reviewed
by doctors at Dartmouth Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   In online support groups and message boards common on many
health sites, information flows more freely and usually is posted
by lay people, not doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hosts know that they're not an authority, they're not a
counselor, they're not a physician,'' said Todd Woodward,
drkoop.com's executive community producer. ``Whatever you hear here
is not authoritative. But there's always going to be people sharing
Grandma's remedy for a sore knee or whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   With health sites treading closer to the territory of doctors,
they know they will have to be more careful because they will be
judged on their content, not their ability to attract attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we feel our way along some of those bumpy points,
drkoop.com got called on some things that are not way over the edge
but certainly questionable,'' said Bob Pringle, president of
intelihealth.com, an online venture between insurance giant
Aetna/US Healthcare and Johns Hopkins Medical School. ``That
doesn't mean that people couldn't point fingers. You live in a
glass house you have to be careful about throwing stones.''

 &HT;    Microsoft's Word 98 a great deal
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You don't often get deals like this from software
giant Microsoft, which is also the largest developer of Macintosh
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The company is offering its popular word processor at a
two-thirds discount. And it's throwing in tons of new stuff to
boot.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, Word 98, which is also part of the Microsoft
Office suite, was selling for around $330 in the Mac catalogs as a
stand-alone product.
</P>
<P>
   Now Microsoft is offering the same program, with some added
templates, for $99 (after the mailing of a $30 rebate card). The
marketing pitch is that this version of Word is for iMac and iBook
users. But Word 98 Special Edition, as it is called, will work with
any Power Mac.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect, but don't know as a fact, that Microsoft lowered the
price to compete against a handful of challengers that have lowered
prices or offered free versions of their word processors.
</P>
<P>
   WordPerfect, for example, is now available for free via the
Internet. This program offers about 80 percent of Word's features
and was at one time Microsoft's leading competitor in the Mac word
processing market. You'll find this download at
www.corel.com/products
</P>
<P>
   /macintosh/wpmac35/packfreedownload
</P>
<P>
   .htm.
</P>
<P>
   Nisus Writer, another first-rate word processor, is also
offering a free download of an earlier version of itself. This
program still has features, such as maintaining multiple
clipboards, that the Mac version of Word has yet to offer.
</P>
<P>
   While Nisus Writer and WordPerfect are each excellent programs,
Microsoft's current offering on Word is hard to beat.
</P>
<P>
   For one, whether you like it or not, Word is the word processing
standard, especially in the office. Word 98 is probably the best
Mac version Microsoft has ever produced.
</P>
<P>
   Word 98 finally supports full drag-and-drop technology. It also
incorporates the look and feel of Apple Computer's latest operating
system, OS 8. It sports OS 8's platinum look, contextual menus and
extensive interactive help.
</P>
<P>
   Word even adds some small but handy innovations of its own.
Among the better ones are buttons that let you easily jump from
page to page, chart to chart or graphic to graphic.
</P>
<P>
   Another powerful feature is the document map, which lets you
easily navigate a book or report through an outline. Other features
include buttons that let you highlight text with a yellow marker
and add comments that appear only when you place your cursor over
marked text.
</P>
<P>
   Now, to sweeten the pot, Microsoft is throwing in with its
special edition of Word thousands of clip art images. There are
also 100 greeting card templates.

 &HT;    Get the inside scoop on what people read
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ More fun than eBay, less expensive than CDNow and far
more entertaining than watching your Net stocks hit another
all-time high is the newest gimmick from Amazon.com designed to
chew up more of your online time.
</P>
<P>
   It's an endless stream of best-seller lists from every nook and
corner of the world called purchase circles.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon, which began life as an online bookseller and quickly
morphed into the Web's very own virtual Wal-Mart, has always
published best-seller lists of books, CDs and videos. But looking
at The New York Times best-seller list filled with the usual
suspects like John Grisham legal thrillers and Oprah's book of the
month is about as exciting as watching paint dry.
</P>
<P>
   Purchase circles are totally different. What Amazon has done is
group the items it ships to a particular ZIP code and to a domain
name, such as Microsoft.com. From this pile of data, it is able to
apply an algorithm that builds best-seller lists for cities,
states, universities and major corporations. All the information is
anonymous, so there's no way of knowing what individuals are
reading at each location, but what you get is an interesting,
often-amusing picture of what people are reading in boardrooms,
classrooms and subway trains all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   For example, business is on the minds of Atlanta residents, who
stay local with books by former Coca-Cola marketing guru Sergio
Zyman and ``Built From Scratch,'' the story of Atlanta-based Home
Depot.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the charts is ``The Terrible Truth About
Liberals'' by talk radio host Neal Boortz. Tom Wolfe's Atlanta
epic, ``A Man in Full,'' is also on the list, along with ``The
Sweet Potato Queen's Book of Love,'' an irreverent guide to life by
a legendary group of Southern belles from Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, over in San Francisco, technology dominates the list
of local favorites. Topping the list are books with titles like
``The Silicon Boys and Their Valley of Dreams.'' Po Bronson's ``The
Nudist on the Late Shift and Other True Tales of Silicon Valley''
and Michael Wolff's near-classic Net tale, ``Burn Rate,'' also pop
up on this list. E-commerce wannabes are busy studying ``Why We
Buy: The Science of Shopping.'' Still, a few best sellers such as
``The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing'' and ``Memoirs of a
Geisha'' did slip into the Bay Area top 10.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't live in a metro area, never fear: Amazon compiles
purchase circles for the most remote village and hamlet, from
Palmer, Alaska (``How to Get Started in Electronic Day Trading'')
to York, Maine (Tom Brokaw's ``The Greatest Generation'').
</P>
<P>
   Isn't this fun?
</P>
<P>
   What's going on in corporate America? Well, let's see what
they're reading. Topping the list over at BellSouth is a book
called ``First, We Break All the Rules: What the World's Greatest
Managers Do Differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Close on its heels are books about dieting, coping and
spirituality. Celine Dion and Andrea Bocelli are the big musical
favorites at BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   What does this say about the telecommunications giant? That's
hard to say, but someone's bound to write a term paper about it.
They say you are what you eat; what will they say about what you
read?
</P>
<P>
   Amazon seems to have files on every ZIP code and every company
in America. One click of the mouse and you'll see that history,
technology and genetics texts are hot at Harvard. You can also find
out that they read these books while grooving to tunes from Lauryn
Hill, U2, Madonna and the Buena Vista Social Club.
</P>
<P>
   You can look at a purchase circle and wonder why there is a run
on Italian travelogues at Emory University, but then you don't have
to be a rocket scientist to figure out why George Stephanopoulos'
book, ``All Too Human,'' tops the best-seller list in the U.S.
Senate. Still, folk rocker Lucinda Williams topping the Senate's
musical selections does give you pause for thought.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon doesn't say exactly what it wants to accomplish with
these endless lists of who's buying what, and some people and
corporations don't like their reading preferences splashed all over
the Internet for everyone to see. Amazon provides users with a way
to keep their book purchases to themselves, and there's a number to
call to have a company or university deleted from the published
lists.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the purchase circles are a gimmick, but it works. It's a
voyeuristic peek into the bookshelves of all kinds of people:
students, parents and executives.
</P>
<P>
   There are probably a million uses for purchase circles Amazon
never even thought of. Why not log on to Amazon at your next dinner
party and have people guess what's playing in Peoria? This can be
hours of fun for the whole family. You don't even need your credit
card.

NOMENCLATURE FOR THE AGE OF UMBILICUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Oct. 3)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.) 
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A full-page color advertisement in respectable newspapers for
the movie ``American Beauty'' zeroed in on a female abdomen.
Staring out at the reader, like the inescapable single eye of a
Cyclops, was the model's  &UR; umbilicus &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Showing that portion of the anatomy was not in bad taste because
 &UR; umbilici &LR;  are omnipresent these days. Fashion models sashay down
the midway with the smooth flesh of their flat stomachs proudly
exposed, and nubile shoppers parade through malls with breezes
causing goose bumps on their midsections. And at the center of
attention is the rounded depression, or the sometimes slight
protuberance, the dialectical synonymy of which we examine today.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking  &UR; bellybuttons &LR; , the focus of fashion at the  &UR; fin
de millenaire &LR; . A post-monokini shock was needed. If the display of
nipples no longer titillated, designers asked one another, could
the showing of bottoms be far behind? But when even the thong lost
its shock value, fashion's eye landed on the center of it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between the emotion and the response,'' wrote the poet,
``Falls the Shadow.'' Between the  &UR; halter &LR;  and the  &UR; hip-hugger &LR; , or
between the  &UR; cropped top &LR;  and the  &UR; low-slung pants &LR; , Falls the
 &UR; Navel &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   The Romans called the point at which the cord connecting the
fetus with the placenta was cut and tied off the  &UR; umbilicus &LR; , from
 &UR; umbo &LR; , ``knob, projection.'' Speakers of Old High German and Old
English preferred a Greek root,  &UR; omphalos &LR; , which led to  &UR; nabalo &LR; 
and  &UR; nafela &LR; , and then popped up in Shakespeare as ``he unseamed
him from the  &UR; naue &LR;  to the chops,'' and developed into Sir Thomas
Browne's 1646 observation, ``The use of the  &UR; Navell &LR;  is to continue
the infant into the mother.'' From there to James Russell Lowell's
1873 poetry: ``He lifted not his eyes from off his  &UR; navel &LR; 's mystic
knot.''
</P>
<P>
   That notion of self-absorption was picked up by the playwright
Eugene O'Neill: ``I had a mental view of him regarding his  &UR; navel &LR; 
frenziedly by the hour,'' and by the BBC's Listener in 1966: ``One
sits in a New York traffic jam, contemplating, as it were, the
city's  &UR; navel &LR; .'' Those who do this religiously are called
omphalopsychic, from a sect of quietists who induced hypnotic
trances by gazing at their navels.
</P>
<P>
   Today, many continue the introspective study. `` &UR; Bellybuttons &LR;  _
there are two kinds,'' said a character in the 1973 ``Odd Couple,''
``the kind that go in and the kind that go out. I want an  &UR; outie &LR; !
No, no! I want an  &UR; innie &LR; !'' But today, many more of us are
contemplating the navels of other people, forcing synonymists to
consider the varied nomenclature.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bellybutton &LR;  was first noted by John Bartlett in the 1877
edition of his Dictionary of Americanisms. Rudyard Kipling liked
that noun in 1934, scorning fights with those ``who do not come up
to your  &UR; bellybutton &LR; .'' Although Aldous Huxley preferred
 &UR; tummy-button &LR; , J.B. Priestley in 1946 minted a nice trope with
this sign of stomach-tightened nervousness: ``with your
 &UR; bellybutton &LR;  knockin' against your backbone.'' (It's two words in
Merriam-Webster, one word in Webster's New World. I go with the
analogy of  &UR; bellyache &LR; , not  &UR; belly dancer &LR; .)
</P>
<P>
   Dialect-delighting Americans, however, have worked out a variety
of names for the same anatomical place. Thanks to the editors of
the Dictionary of American Regional English (now hard at work at
the University of Wisconsin at Madison on their fourth volume,
covering the letters P to S), we can examine a few answers to their
Question X34/1, ``What are some other names and nicknames for the
 &UR; navel &LR; ?''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; One-eyed Mabel &LR;  was one response, probably derived from the
popular  &UR; nabel &LR; , a variant of  &UR; navel &LR;  recalling the Old High German
 &UR; nabalo &LR; .  &UR; Button &LR;  and  &UR; buttonhole &LR;  were frequent choices, and a
fair sampling called it a  &UR; belly-hole &LR; .  &UR; Chicken butt &LR;  and  &UR; chicken
peck &LR;  were noted. Those interested in content preferred
 &UR; lint-catcher &LR; ,  &UR; lint-getter &LR;  and  &UR; lint-strainer &LR; . Perhaps a Greek
influence can be found in one respondent's  &UR; oompalikis &LR;  and several
 &UR; piko &LR;  answers. The midriff midrash includes the Yiddish  &UR; pupik &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Many responses to DARE's survey began with the word  &UR; where &LR; . In
the South, it was  &UR; where the Yankee shot you &LR; ; in the West,  &UR; where
the Indians shot you &LR; , and across the country,  &UR; where I got shot in
the war &LR; . Two interviewees eschewed the violent gunfire-bullet-hole
metaphor and replied with the less bellicose  &UR; where you got hit
with a pick &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   CHICOMS
</P>
<P>
   Authors of historical fiction worry about anachronism. ``And now
the clock strikes 1,'' says Dromio of Syracuse, but it was a
Shakespearean comedy of error: Mechanical clocks, not invented
until the 14th century, were not available in ancient Ephesus.
</P>
<P>
   I had the same problem writing a novel set in our Federal
period, and wondered what phrase a man of that era would have used
for what we now call  &UR; hush money &LR; . (Turns out Thomas Jefferson used
the words  &UR; hush money &LR;  in a letter, nearly a century after Steele
and Swift.)
</P>
<P>
   Thus it was when I came to the word  &UR; Chicom &LR;  in Seymour
Topping's ``Peking Letter,'' a riveting novel of the Chinese civil
war, I wondered: Was that word _ a portmanteau of ``Chinese
Communist'' _ in use in the late '40s?
</P>
<P>
   The earliest citation in the OED is 1966; the Random House
Historical Dictionary of American Slang found a 1964 use by Robin
Moore in his novel ``The Green Berets.'' So I called Top, a
longtime New York Times colleague and now administrator of the
Pulitzer Prizes, and put it to him. He was the Associated Press
correspondent in Peking (now spelled Beijing) reporting on that
war; was the word in use at the time?
</P>
<P>
   ``You bet it was, and it was no derogation,'' he recalled. ``The
truce teams of our Military Advisory Group referred to the
Nationalist Chinese as the  &UR; Nats &LR;  and the Communist Chinese as the
 &UR; Chicoms &LR; . I can hear it now _ `The  &UR; Chicoms &LR;  took Mukden, and the
 &UR; Nats &LR;  didn't put up much of a fight.'''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the value to political etymology of the historical
novel. Years from now, our descendants will be reading dramas about
the struggle between today's  &UR; Chicoms &LR;  and their rivals on
politically free Taiwan, the  &UR; Chidems &LR; .

 &HT;    Welcome to the new 'hood, and network
 &HT;    By Gerry Yandel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Normally, I hate moving.
</P>
<P>
   But this time it was different: I knew a computer network was
hidden in my walls, and it was just dying to be used.
</P>
<P>
   The Cat 5 cable snaking behind the Sheetrock all but screamed at
me while I puttered around, redistributing the contents of unpacked
boxes, shuffling furniture, hanging towel bars and installing
blinds.
</P>
<P>
   After a few weeks, when we could see parts of the floor between
the piles of belongings, I could contain myself no longer: I had to
test out my wiring and fire up the ethernet.
</P>
<P>
   Without really meaning to, I found myself standing in the
networking aisle of the local CompUSA debating quantity vs.
quality.
</P>
<P>
   Quality won out, in no small part because of the e-mails several
readers sent warning me against the perils of skimping on my NICs
and hub. So, even though they were twice _ and in some cases thrice
_ as much as other products, I stuck with 3Com and Intel for my
hardware, just as you all suggested.
</P>
<P>
   About $300 later, I walked out with a four-port Intel hub, a
3Com 10/100 NIC for my main machine and a 3Com LAN PC card _ which
was the real big-ticket item at $180 _ for the laptop.
</P>
<P>
   When I got home with the goodies, I had a simple plan: Wire up
the P166, take the laptop around to all the network jacks in the
house and check the connections.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, I plan to set up a client-server network with a
proxy server to be able to share my Internet connection. But for my
tests I didn't need anything tricky or fancy. Both my machines use
Win95, and by all accounts setting up a peer-to-peer network was
supposed to be a snap.
</P>
<P>
   So I installed my NICs, plugged in the hub and promptly hit a
snag.
</P>
<P>
   I had no Network Neighborhood icon on my desktop.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of those annoying icons Windows won't let you remove
from the desktop. So, earlier, I had used a program called TweakUI
to get rid of it almost as soon as I bought my trusty old P166 a
couple of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Once I restored the icon to its preordained place, the first
step was to make sure I had all the necessary clients, adapters and
protocols installed in my network settings.
</P>
<P>
   The Client for Microsoft Networks, Client for Netware Networks,
and file and printer sharing software was already installed by
default. There was also the dial-up adapter, which was put in when
I configured TCP/IP through Win95, and my new 3Com adapter was
listed as well.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good.
</P>
<P>
   Now to check the protocols.
</P>
<P>
   Small LANs like mine, which could have up to eight ports if Mrs.
Power User lets me put machines in the kitchen and dining room
(yeah, right), only really need to deal with three protocols in the
networking preferences: TCP/IP, for the Internet; IPX/SPX, used by
many games for speedy LAN play; and NetBUI for LAN file and printer
sharing.
</P>
<P>
   A TCP protocol was already set up for the dial-up adapter, and a
second TCP protocol appeared that was bound to my 3Com ethernet
card.
</P>
<P>
   Adding protocols is no more difficult than clicking on ``Add''
and finding them under the subsequent choices for Microsoft. There
can be some confusion when two protocols of each type appear in the
list, but one is for the dial-up adapter and one is for the NIC.
</P>
<P>
   The only real configuration needed is for the TCP/IP protocol,
which requires that each machine on the network have a unique IP
address, such as 10.0.0.1 for computer 1, 10.0.0.2 for computer 2,
etc. If your Internet service provider uses dynamic IP addressing,
which most of them do, you will want to leave the TCP bound to the
dial-up adapter alone and only specify IP addresses for the TCP
bound to your network card. (Also, make sure you don't enable file
sharing on your dial-up TCP protocol, which would open up your
drives _ and printer _ to the Internet.)
</P>
<P>
   Next, click the ``File and Print Sharing'' button and check the
box for sharing files. If you have a printer attached to the
machine, click the other box for printer sharing.
</P>
<P>
   The last step is to click the ``Identification'' tab to give the
machine a name and assign it to a work group, which should be the
same for all machines on a small network.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you will have to set up the network preferences for
each machine on your LAN, but that's part of the fun of being a
systems administrator, isn't it? Some more fun of being a sysadmin
is that Win95 makes you reboot every time you change anything in
your network preferences, which gets real annoying real quickly.
</P>
<P>
   All that remains is to go into Windows Explorer and right click
on each drive you want to share, give it a unique name and set the
sharing permissions to full access. Ditto for each printer.
</P>
<P>
   In my case, the whole process _ annoying reboots and testing all
my jacks notwithstanding _ took little over an hour. It would have
taken less except the laptop couldn't find my printer and I spent
20 minutes before I realized the printer wasn't on. (Hey, calling
this column Power User wasn't my idea.)
</P>
<P>
   Although file and print sharing is nice, the real reason for a
peer-to-peer home network is, of course, multiplayer gaming. (You
need a client-server setup with one machine as a proxy server to
share a modem on a LAN.)
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, the first thing I did was to set up network
versions of some of my favorites: ``Quake II,'' ``Hexen II'' and
``Dungeon Keeper.''
</P>
<P>
   But my elation at my in-home game network was quickly snuffed
out ... when I realized the only multiplayer gaming I was going to
be doing was running between room to room making my Paladin punch
my Necromancer and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Because, I am sure Mrs. Power User would take a dim view of
recruiting our daughter Emily into a Hexen Deathmatch ... at least
until she turns 6.

ANNE MANSON, KC'S NEW CLASSICAL DARLING, LIKES TO KEEP THE FOCUS ON
MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANTRELL  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Had the fates decreed differently _ or had Anne Manson been what
most parents would deem a more sensible girl _ she might have been
a physician. As late as her senior year at Harvard University, when
she was looking into study abroad, she was still considering
medical school.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been a logical move for the daughter of a
Cambridge, Mass., orthopedic surgeon. But Manson also inherited her
father's other passion, classical music.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had music in our house all the time,'' the new music
director of the Kansas City Symphony recalls of her youth. ``My
father constantly played recordings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was at school during the Second World War in England, and
he had a teacher whose family had a box for concerts at the Albert
Hall. His teacher would bring a group of kids regularly to
concerts, and it made a huge impact on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Manson's father passed along the favor, as it were, by taking
his own daughters to concerts in the Boston area. Libby, the
younger daughter, went on to other things, but Anne would go on to
study music in England, to become the first woman ever to conduct
the prestigious Vienna Philharmonic and now one of only three
female music directors among the 50 largest North American
orchestras.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Manson and husband Martin Hansen, a lawyer
specializing in international intellectual property rights, were
tidying up their London home to rent out. Their new home base will
be Kansas City, where this week Manson opens her first fall season
as the new music director of the Kansas City Symphony. Offstage
priorities include shopping for furniture for their new home, south
of the University of Missouri-Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   A private person
</P>
<P>
   So who is this new mover and shaker on the Kansas City arts
scene _ and, at age 37, one of the youngest music directors around?
(She'll turn 38 on Tuesday.)
</P>
<P>
   Sit down with Manson in a dressing room after a rehearsal and
you'll find a compact, crisply spoken woman exuding well-bred
graciousness. But don't expect Midwestern chumminess or folksiness:
She is a Bostonian, with a certain reserve doubtless reinforced by
a decade and a half of living in England. She admits to wariness at
the People magazine-type interest in the private lives of public
figures.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no interviewing of her parents, both now retired.
There will be no pictures with son Ben, born only a few days before
her Kansas City appointment was announced, in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really very private,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one on one, Manson traces a human interest story with its
share of pivotal decisions _ and some lucky breaks. It's sometimes
easy to forget that this is her first job as an orchestra music
director. She's very much a work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   But the Symphony's music director search committee _ and its
board of trustees _ saw enough promise in her that they passed up
considerably older and more experienced candidates for the job. In
a field long dominated by white-maned men, youth and good looks no
longer are deemed evidence of superficiality. The novelty of a
female music director may actually be a marketing asset.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in a comfortable, intellectually upmarket family _
her mother taught English and wrote book reviews _ Manson began
studying piano ``as early as I can remember.'' She went on to more
serious study of the viola and singing in church choirs. Sister
Libby, four years younger, played piano and flute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played a lot of chamber music at home and with other
people,'' Manson says. ``I really think that's so important for
children, because that's how music becomes a language that means
something to you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Manson girls were taken to a lot of chamber music concerts,
and Anne remembers seeing a Metropolitan Opera touring production
of ``Don Giovanni.'' But not until she was in high school _ at a
private girls' school bearing the toney name Windsor _ did she
attend her first orchestra concert.
</P>
<P>
   It was a doozie: the Boston Symphony Orchestra and chorus
performing Sir Michael Tippett's oratorio ``A Child of Our Time.''
Composed between 1939 and 1941, it's a powerful, moving response to
Nazi persecution of the Jews _ and a provocative consideration of
inhumanity in general. (Manson will conduct the work here in
November.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I was completely knocked out by it,'' Manson recalls. ``It was
an amazing experience. I still remember how the soprano looked and
what she sounded like.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston to London
</P>
<P>
   Still, Manson entered Harvard University with a double major,
pairing a liberal-arts program called history and literature with
pre-med, with some music courses on the side. She ended up with a
music major and pre-med minor.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's music department is known for academic music studies,
not performance training, and Manson graduated with a bachelor of
arts in music theory and analysis. But along the way she took a
course in choral conducting and another in orchestral conducting,
and she got a couple of chances to lead the Harvard orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   With graduation looming, Manson started casting about for
fellowships for foreign study. Ultimately she decided to explore
music, and she landed a Marshall Scholarship for study in London.
She signed up for a graduate program in theory and analysis at
King's College of the University of London. But on the side she
began studying conducting at the Royal College of Music with Norman
Del Mar, a respected conductor as well as composer and writer on
music.
</P>
<P>
   ``He put me in front of the symphony orchestra at the Royal
College quite a lot,'' Manson recalls, ``and I really wasn't ready
for it. I had done hardly any conducting before. But I learned a
tremendous amount from him.''
</P>
<P>
   After finishing her master's, Manson spent another year in the
opera-conducting program at the Royal College. On the side, she
talked some fellow students into putting together a performance of
Mozart's ``Cosi fan tutte.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was in an open courtyard in London,'' she recalls. ``But it
had tall walls, so the acoustic was beautiful. Because none of us
was paid, we worked really hard. There was no limit to rehearsals _
if we needed to do more, we would just get some sandwiches and stay
into the evening.''
</P>
<P>
   That experience stirred Manson's interest in conducting opera,
and she landed an opera conducting fellowship at the Royal Northern
College of Music in Manchester.
</P>
<P>
   ``They left you alone to do your rehearsals,'' she says of the
school's postgraduate conducting program. ``But they videoed a lot
of stuff and you had the ghastly experience of watching yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in London she teamed up with a theater director friend to
form a small opera company to perform off-the-beaten-path
20th-century repertory. The off-and-on company worked its way up to
the Queen Elizabeth Hall, one of the prime performance venues in
London's South Bank performing arts complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's certainly made a name here,'' says Hugh Canning of the
Sunday Times of London, probably the dean of British music critics.
``She's quite well-known for allowing herself very progressive
repertory ideas. I haven't seen her work for some time, but she's
known to be a live wire here.''
</P>
<P>
   Vienna apprenticeship
</P>
<P>
   Still, Manson faced a frustrating period after finishing the
opera conducting program in Manchester.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the hardest juncture when you're a conductor, to get
your first engagement,'' she says. ``No one knows anything about
you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a concert in Norway that first season after I finished,
and I was teaching a bit _ coaching chamber music and so forth in
London. But I was getting really fed up and bored.''
</P>
<P>
   She shared her frustration with James Lockhart, who headed the
opera program at the Royal College of Music. He volunteered to
write a letter to Claudio Abbado, then music director of the Vienna
State Opera, to see if Manson could sit in on his rehearsals.
</P>
<P>
   Given a green light, Manson headed to Vienna, settled in with a
friend living there and signed up for an intensive German course.
She observed Abbado's rehearsals for ``Don Giovanni.'' Then
Abbado's regular assistant began spending more and more time out of
town and Manson got tapped to fill in. That's how she ended up one
day in front of the Vienna Philharmonic, the orchestra of the
Vienna State Opera, taking the place of an indisposed Abbado in a
rehearsal of ``Boris Godunov.'' Abbado later tapped Manson to
conduct the end of a run of ``Boris'' at the 1994 Salzburg
Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the recent controversy over the Vienna
Philharmonic's refusal to admit female players, the sight of a
woman conductor must have raised some blood pressures _ not least
of all Manson's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very nervous,'' she admits, ``but I don't think that's
what made me nervous. It was just the whole setting, that audience.
The standard of performance there is kind of the pinnacle.''
</P>
<P>
   In the audience in Salzburg was composer-conductor Pierre
Boulez, who liked what he saw and heard enough to arrange for
Manson to conduct his Paris-based Ensemble InterContemporain. She
began to get other guest-conducting gigs: the London Mozart
Players, the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, the Iceland Symphony
Orchestra, the Vienna Chamber Orchestra. In 1995 she made her
American debut, conducting Samuel Barber's ``Vanessa'' for
Washington (D.C.) Opera.
</P>
<P>
   That's when her sister played Cupid, introducing Manson to
Stanford Law School-trained lawyer Martin Hansen (who also happens
to have studied viola).
</P>
<P>
   ``Luckily, it was an opera, which means you're in town for a
long period of time,'' Manson says. ``We met around New Year's, and
I was in Washington until the end of February.''
</P>
<P>
   The romance blossomed in trans-Atlantic commute mode, and then
Hansen moved to London, home base for Manson's growing career in
England and Europe. They were married in 1997; son Ben came along a
year later.
</P>
<P>
   Building trust
</P>
<P>
   When the Kansas City Symphony started its search for a new music
director to replace the departing William McGlaughlin, executive
director Roland Valliere sought suggestions from his counterpart at
the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Henry Fogel. Fogel passed along the
name of this young woman he'd seen in a guest conducting gig with
the Iceland Symphony Orchestra (with which Manson has become a
regular).
</P>
<P>
   ``What struck me is a kind of freshness and vitality in the
music-making,'' Fogel says, ``and a sense of really connecting with
the orchestra. She seems to react to what she hears and to draw the
best out of her players.''
</P>
<P>
   Put on the list of 11 more or less official candidates for the
job, a visibly pregnant Manson conducted her audition concerts in
January 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The search committee was impressed with Manson's no-nonsense
ideas for building up an orchestra with little profile beyond its
metropolitan area _ and with a local reputation for erratic
performances. And she seemed to light up virtually everyone in her
path.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was this instantaneous positive reaction which came from
all the different constituencies,'' says Robert Kipp, the Hallmark
Cards executive who headed the Symphony's search committee. ``It
came first from the orchestra, second from those of us involved in
the community and third from the public.''
</P>
<P>
   And the rest is Kansas City history.

 &HT;    Get the inside scoop on what people read
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ More fun than eBay, less expensive than CDNow and far
more entertaining than watching your Net stocks hit another
all-time high is the newest gimmick from Amazon.com designed to
chew up more of your online time.
</P>
<P>
   It's an endless stream of best-seller lists from every nook and
corner of the world called purchase circles.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon, which began life as an online bookseller and quickly
morphed into the Web's very own virtual Wal-Mart, has always
published best-seller lists of books, CDs and videos. But looking
at The New York Times best-seller list filled with the usual
suspects like John Grisham legal thrillers and Oprah's book of the
month is about as exciting as watching paint dry.
</P>
<P>
   Purchase circles are totally different. What Amazon has done is
group the items it ships to a particular ZIP code and to a domain
name, such as Microsoft.com. From this pile of data, it is able to
apply an algorithm that builds best-seller lists for cities,
states, universities and major corporations. All the information is
anonymous, so there's no way of knowing what individuals are
reading at each location, but what you get is an interesting,
often-amusing picture of what people are reading in boardrooms,
classrooms and subway trains all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   For example, business is on the minds of Atlanta residents, who
stay local with books by former Coca-Cola marketing guru Sergio
Zyman and ``Built From Scratch,'' the story of Atlanta-based Home
Depot.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the charts is ``The Terrible Truth About
Liberals'' by talk radio host Neal Boortz. Tom Wolfe's Atlanta
epic, ``A Man in Full,'' is also on the list, along with ``The
Sweet Potato Queen's Book of Love,'' an irreverent guide to life by
a legendary group of Southern belles from Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, over in San Francisco, technology dominates the list
of local favorites. Topping the list are books with titles like
``The Silicon Boys and Their Valley of Dreams.'' Po Bronson's ``The
Nudist on the Late Shift and Other True Tales of Silicon Valley''
and Michael Wolff's near-classic Net tale, ``Burn Rate,'' also pop
up on this list. E-commerce wannabes are busy studying ``Why We
Buy: The Science of Shopping.'' Still, a few best sellers such as
``The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing'' and ``Memoirs of a
Geisha'' did slip into the Bay Area top 10.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't live in a metro area, never fear: Amazon compiles
purchase circles for the most remote village and hamlet, from
Palmer, Alaska (``How to Get Started in Electronic Day Trading'')
to York, Maine (Tom Brokaw's ``The Greatest Generation'').
</P>
<P>
   Isn't this fun?
</P>
<P>
   What's going on in corporate America? Well, let's see what
they're reading. Topping the list over at BellSouth is a book
called ``First, We Break All the Rules: What the World's Greatest
Managers Do Differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Close on its heels are books about dieting, coping and
spirituality. Celine Dion and Andrea Bocelli are the big musical
favorites at BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   What does this say about the telecommunications giant? That's
hard to say, but someone's bound to write a term paper about it.
They say you are what you eat; what will they say about what you
read?
</P>
<P>
   Amazon seems to have files on every ZIP code and every company
in America. One click of the mouse and you'll see that history,
technology and genetics texts are hot at Harvard. You can also find
out that they read these books while grooving to tunes from Lauryn
Hill, U2, Madonna and the Buena Vista Social Club.
</P>
<P>
   You can look at a purchase circle and wonder why there is a run
on Italian travelogues at Emory University, but then you don't have
to be a rocket scientist to figure out why George Stephanopoulos'
book, ``All Too Human,'' tops the best-seller list in the U.S.
Senate. Still, folk rocker Lucinda Williams topping the Senate's
musical selections does give you pause for thought.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon doesn't say exactly what it wants to accomplish with
these endless lists of who's buying what, and some people and
corporations don't like their reading preferences splashed all over
the Internet for everyone to see. Amazon provides users with a way
to keep their book purchases to themselves, and there's a number to
call to have a company or university deleted from the published
lists.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the purchase circles are a gimmick, but it works. It's a
voyeuristic peek into the bookshelves of all kinds of people:
students, parents and executives.
</P>
<P>
   There are probably a million uses for purchase circles Amazon
never even thought of. Why not log on to Amazon at your next dinner
party and have people guess what's playing in Peoria? This can be
hours of fun for the whole family. You don't even need your credit
card.

 &HT;    New hand-held games are made for little kids
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Hand-held electronic games are popular with teens
and preteens, but they can be frustrating for smaller children. Big
brothers and sisters hardly ever let the little ones play, and when
they do the games may be too difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro Games added eight games to its hand-held game line this
year, including six games designed to be played by players 8 years
old or younger. Hand-held games, which are produced by several
companies, are available at most toy and discount stores.
</P>
<P>
   Among Hasbro's new games for kids are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Pooh Flickering Fireflies, ages 3 to 5: Talking fireflies lead
players on a chase through the 100 Acre Wood of the popular Winnie
the Pooh series. The game automatically adjusts to three skill
levels and features four games. Suggested price: $14.99.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ballzerko, ages 5 and older: This is an electronic pinball
game with an electronic voice, lights, music and sounds for three
fast-paced activities. Suggested price: $19.99.
</P>
<P>
   _ Operation: The portable, electronic version of the classic
board game lets players conduct ``operations'' and remove parts
like ``butterflies in the stomach'' from their imaginary patients.
The game has a time to let players race against the clock.
Suggested price: $17.99.
</P>
<P>
   _ Simon, ages 7 to adult: The original version of this game was
hot in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The game plays a series of four lights and accompanying tones,
and players try to repeat the pattern by touching four colored
buttons in the proper order. Hasbro's portable version has four
skill levels and three ways to play. Suggested price: $7.99.
</P>
<P>
   The other new hand-held games in the Hasbro line this year are
Frogger, Bop It Extreme, Trivial Pursuit NFL Edition and Trivial
Pursuit NASCAR Edition.

 &HT;    Mechanical nose sniffs out trouble
 &HT;    By Laura A. Bischoff
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAIRBORN, Ohio _ It may not take much to figure out that hog
manure stinks, but Wright State University Assistant Professor
Ricardo Guiterrez-Osuna has an electronic nose that objectively and
precisely measures such odors.
</P>
<P>
   Guiterrez, 31, began working on the electronic nose project as a
graduate student at North Carolina State University in 1996. The
National Pork Producers Association helped fund the project because
``they wanted a device to give an objective sense of smell,''
Guiterrez said.
</P>
<P>
   The human nose is roughly 1,000 times more sensitive but human
olfactory abilities adapt to smells after a while, said Guiterrez.
So a hog farmer isn't as sensitive to the manure smell or a chef
doesn't smell cooking food as strongly after being in the kitchen
awhile, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Guiterrez brought the electronic nose project to Wright State a
year ago when he was appointed to the computer science and
engineering department.
</P>
<P>
   The electronic nose can be used to measure food or beverage
quality by sniffing each product as it rolls off the manufacturing
line, diagnose infections by sniffing bacteria cultures and
eventually detect mustard gas or other hazardous compounds used in
warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Research on electronic noses originated in England in the 1980s
but only a handful of scientists in the United States are working
on such projects, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The machine consists of a power supply, pump, five valves,
electronic circuit boards and chamber with 16 tin oxide sensors. It
sits on a small sheet of particle board and is hooked up to a
laptop computer. Guiterrez is able to fit it into a plastic
container about the size of a toy box when using it outside of his
lab.
</P>
<P>
   To demonstrate the nose, Guiterrez sprinkles cinnamon into a jar
with a plastic tube sticking out of the lid. He plugs the tube into
a valve on the nose. The air in the cinnamon jar is pumped through
the machine. The surfaces of the 16 sensors react, changing the
conductivity and sending a signal to the laptop. The 16 colored
lines move from straight to up and down on the screen into a
distinct pattern that represents cinnamon's fingerprint. The more
times the machine smells, the better the recognition pattern
becomes.
</P>
<P>
   A 60-second whiff by the device's 16 sensors results in 900
measurements. Guiterrez's computer program uses mathematical
calculations to compress that data down to two measurements that
can be plotted using linear algebra. The program is so precise that
the differences between the smells of Coke and Pepsi can be easily
plotted _ an experiment Guiterrez conducted as part of his doctoral
dissertation.
</P>
<P>
   Guiterrez said he sees the device eventually being used to
control emissions into the environment and helping doctors diagnose
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not interested in making money off it right now. I'm
interested in the research and science of it,'' he said.

 &HT;    Obey Husted's First Law: Leave well enough alone
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I don't know how many computers we have here at the
newspaper _ literally thousands. There are two of them on my desk
at work, another at home. Sometimes I feel as if I belong to a big
dysfunctional family of semiconductors and processors.
</P>
<P>
   Like most dysfunctional families, this family of mine tries hard
to change things to make them better. But often we go about it in
the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   This morning, for instance, my work e-mail program didn't work.
Then, when I got ready to write this column, I discovered that the
software we use to produce this newspaper has been upgraded once
again. So nothing looked quite right, or worked quite right.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes I think that this dysfunctional family of mine needs
to sit down and have a good talk.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what I am gradually coming to believe about computers.
Lots of times, not just at work, we feel compelled to change things
just because we haven't changed them in a while. There's this
desperate feeling that if we just keep changing that we'll hit the
magic formula ... sort of like the monkeys eventually typing
Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   When a new version of Windows comes out, or a new edition of
some popular word processor or e-mail program, I get bombarded with
letters and calls from readers eager to make the change to the
newest version.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that all those computers are just tools. Unless you
are a computer hobbyist (and there's nothing wrong with that), the
only value of your computer is in the work it can do for you. The
less you notice the computer or the software, the better. If you
were building a barn, you wouldn't want to have to think about the
hammer or worry it needed an upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Now we get to Husted's First Law of Computing: If the computer
and the software that you have can do the work that you need it to
do, don't upgrade, don't add memory, don't do a danged thing. Your
computer will tell you when it needs an upgrade. You'll sit down
one day and actually need to do something important. And either the
computer or the software won't be up to the job. That's when you
need to fix things.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to Husted's Second Law of Computing for when
that happens: Know what you are going to do with your computer and
make your buying and upgrading decision based on that, not just by
browsing the ads and buying the most powerful computer available.
This means that if you really and truly are only going to log on to
the Web, do word processing and balance your checkbook, you don't
need a top-of-the-line super computer. For those tasks, you won't
even notice the speed difference except on your credit card
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how to put these two laws of computing to work.
</P>
<P>
   First, stop worrying so much about your computer. You don't sit
up nights wondering (or I hope you don't) if a new microwave oven
will change your life in some fundamental way. Think of all the
time you are going to save by not reading all those computer
magazines. And people will enjoy your company more at parties now
that you talk about stuff other than the latest processor from
Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Second, don't assume that every task in your life requires a
computer. Just because something can be done with a computer
doesn't mean that it should be done with a computer. I am reminded
of this each time I go to one of the big computer shows _ places
where the attendees have access to almost any technology available.
</P>
<P>
   Do you know what most of those high-tech hot shots use to take
notes? PalmPilots? Pocket organizers? Sub-notebook-sized computers?
</P>
<P>
   Nope. Most of them use scraps of paper and a pen. Maybe it's
time we all learned from the experts.
</P>
<P>
   MY MISTAKE
</P>
<P>
   OK. The Y2K bug bit me.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, I told you a way to change the date settings in
Windows so that it could handle four-digit dates. I said that, by
doing that, Windows would handle Y2K better.
</P>
<P>
   That's wrong. Doing what I told you does no harm. So don't
worry. But unfortunately, it does no good. It just changes the way
that Windows displays dates on the screen. It does not change the
way Windows handles dates internally. Luckily, there are few Y2K
problems with Windows anyway.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, you can get Y2K information about all of Microsoft's
products, not just Windows, from this Web site:
www.microsoft.com/technet

 &HT;    On health Web sites, discrepancies can be as common as answers
 &HT;    By Heather Cocks
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Ask the health experts at Johns Hopkins
University's Intelihealth Web site, and they'll say taking vitamins
isn't widely regarded as a way to treat or control Hepatitis C.
</P>
<P>
   But surf on over to Flash Gordon, M.D., the most prolific health
guru at www.webmd.com, and he'll tell you different. Gordon singles
out Vitamins C and E, as well as flaxseed oil, as the diet
supplements doctors think can help Hepatitis C patients.
</P>
<P>
   Such discrepancies prove fairly common among health-related Web
sites. The Johns Hopkins team warns osteoporosis sufferers against
drinking alcohol, but the team at the Mayo Clinic's Web site claims
alcohol in moderation is acceptable for those with the bone
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Internet health sites have come under scrutiny in recent months
from health professionals who fear that in the lucrative online
arena, the business-minded entrepreneurs behind the Web sites could
end up pledging allegiance to advertisers rather than the
Hippocratic Oath. Some critics also claim that, by relying on
medical Web sites, consumers risk making a self-diagnosis based on
biased or unreliable information.
</P>
<P>
   To evaluate the consistency _ or dissimilarities _ of medical
advice being dispensed online, an Austin American-Statesman
reporter tried posing eight health questions to six Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The only common thread? Silence.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with an urgent medical query won't have much luck with
the online experts. None of the sites that offered ``ask the
experts'' sections produced any response over an 11-day period _
not surprising, because each site cautions that the high number of
questions received means no guarantee of an answer.
</P>
<P>
   Those who seek help with their own detailed scenarios may also
strike out. Broad questions are most likely to be answered,
according to most sites _ with the exception of The Mayo Clinic
site, www.mayohealth.org, and the Johns Hopkins site at
www.intelihealth.com, both of which fielded very case-specific
queries.
</P>
<P>
   But the answers don't always come from practicing physicians.
The Intelihealth site's ``Ask the Doc'' segment instead featured
answers from professors and researchers at Johns Hopkins.
Drkoop.com's Dr. Nancy Snyderman, is a professor with training in
ear, nose and throat conditions, but makes a living as a television
correspondent.
</P>
<P>
   Feature articles and resource material can provide more answers.
</P>
<P>
   Most online health information cites university researchers,
national associations and medical journals as primary sources. Two
Austin-based sites, drkoop.com and healthanswers.com, produced
seemingly comprehensive profiles of disease symptoms, causes,
treatments and symptoms _ but without attributing that information
to any particular source.
</P>
<P>
   That is part of what's drawn criticism from the medical
community, and the sites seem to be on the defensive. Each article
ends with a small-text disclaimer explaining that the information
is no substitute for a doctor's diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   Drkoop.com flashes a lengthy disclaimer the first time users try
to access information about prescription medication. The disclaimer
states that the site makes every attempt to guarantee the accuracy
of the information, which comes from an independent medical
researcher.
</P>
<P>
   Of the six sites visited, none appeared guilty of bowing to its
sponsors, another criticism of health sites. An ad for Primatene
Mist, an oral inhaler for asthma sufferers, graced the top of the
Mayo Clinic's Web page _ but a quick search turned up the site's
explanatory document on asthma, where its doctors advised patients
against reliance on inhalers.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of accessibility of information, investigating major
diseases or medical conditions is relatively simple. All the sites
categorized information about topics such as AIDS, cancer, diabetes
and women's health into their own sections, offering links to
medical news, question-and-answer archives, journals and chat
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Culling information for rarer or lesser-known conditions proves
trickier. Healthanswers.com turns up information about spina bifida
only if users look for it under the birth defect's other name,
myelomeningocele.
</P>
<P>
   On site-wide searches for spina bifida, Healthanswers.com and
others return more coherent documents with better explanations of
treatments and symptoms. But lists of those more helpful pieces are
also peppered with more complicated reference material such as the
Merriam-Webster Medical Dictionary, where each definition is
littered with medical lingo that the average person may find tough
to digest.
</P>
<P>
   Information about prescription drugs can be just as problematic.
To read about the obesity drug Meridia, well-known thanks to a
flood of television and print advertisements, drkoop.com users have
to brush up on their clinical vocabulary to understand the
potential drug interactions.
</P>
<P>
   Meridia ``should not be taken if you have taken a monoamine
oxidase inhibitor,'' the article warns, ``such as isocarboxazid,
tranylcypromine or phenelzine.''

 &HT;    Health sites are hits - but are they reliable?By Andrew Park
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Looking on the Internet for health information?
You may get more than you expect.
</P>
<P>
   Type in the word ``allergy'' at a health Web site, for example,
and in one screen you can get a wealth of information and
advertising, all seamlessly linked together and personalized for
you. Click here for allergy news, there for how to treat them, over
here for a new drug, here to join a support group, here to buy some
Sudafed.
</P>
<P>
   Not quite an electronic house call but more than just a medical
library, the Internet may be the ultimate tool to disseminate
information about illnesses to the masses.
</P>
<P>
   But should you bet your health on Web site advice?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   While the popularity of online health sites is growing steadily,
so is criticism about them. Some experts warn that they can be
riddled with problems, such as unethical advertising, conflicts of
interest or simply bad advice.
</P>
<P>
   Some, including the medical profession's governing body, the
American Medical Association, are suggesting that online health
sites should be held to medicine's standards of trustworthiness.
</P>
<P>
   Leading health Web sites acknowledge that establishing
credibility is one of their toughest challenges, but they say that
consumers hold them to high standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we do, it's all about establishing that trusted
relationship in the online world,'' said Don Hackett, chief
executive of Austin's drkoop.com, the most popular health-related
site on the Internet, attracting an estimated 3.5 million visitors
a month. ``In the online world ... all the information glows with
the same intensity, whether it's accurate or not.''
</P>
<P>
   But some say the industry should establish policies for ensuring
accuracy and disclosing the conflicts of interest that come along
with mixing content and commerce, the lifeblood of most Internet
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one of those ventures has a profit motive, so the
information is always going to be suspect to profiteering,'' said
Eric Weidmann, an Austin physician who occasionally reviews
health-related Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Weidmann is a proponent of patients' use of the Web to find
health information and support. But like others, he points out that
because most Web sites are businesses that depend on profits, they
are ``suspect to reliability and motive.''
</P>
<P>
   CREDIBILITY CONCERNS
</P>
<P>
   For an idea of what's driving some of the medical profession's
concern about health Web sites, hit the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes at most health Web sites, you won't find many
doctors _ or few people with any medical training, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the online health sites are typically operated by
entrepreneurs, former health-care executives, techies and
journalists, bringing together content from a variety of sources
while using their own and others' personal experience to dispense
advice.
</P>
<P>
   At drkoop.com, for instance, co-founder and namesake C. Everett
Koop, the former U.S. surgeon general, has little to do with the
daily operation of the drkoop.com, though his name and reputation
lend credibility to the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had perceived that Dr. Koop had a personal interest in
making sure this was credible information, so we jumped on the
bandwagon to allow our patients to have another source of
information,'' said David Morehead, president of the Scott &AMP; White
Health Plan, part of the Temple health-care system that is paying
drkoop.com $40,000 a year for packaged medical content and a place
on its list of preferred hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Search the major consumer health sites today and you might find
inconsistent answers and advice to questions on typical health
problems. One site might suggest taking vitamins is a good way for
treating a strain of hepatitis, for example, while another site
might advise that vitamins do no good.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the advice some Web health sites give is just plain
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   A study in the the August edition of the journal Cancer found
dangerous inaccuracies in cancer data in a sample of 400 health
information sites, nearly half of which had not been subjected to
scientific scrutiny, typically a key step in the publication of
articles in medical journals. The study's author listed only a
handful of sites, including, drkoop.com, that she considered
credible and reliable.
</P>
<P>
   Few people _ if any _ are going to get advice on treating cancer
solely off an Internet site. Most sites, in fact, are careful not
to offer extensive advice for any conditions and to always warn
that their information is not a substitute for a physician's
advice.
</P>
<P>
   But some critics say visitors to almost any health Web site
should beware of what is becoming perhaps the most frequent
criticism of Web sites: potential conflicts of interest. Web
companies' methods of linking information and advertising, some
doctors and medical ethicists say, are rife with the potential for
misrepresentation and bias.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a news report revealed that a women's health Internet
site based in California, WomenFirst, had been paid to promote
brand-name prescription drugs written about regularly in its
articles.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, the AMA recently pointed out that drkoop.com had
not detailed to consumers how C. Everett Koop profited from the
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally, that Web site did not give full disclosure,'' said
Robert Tenery, a Dallas ophthalmologist who sits on the American
Medical Association's Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs,
which is examining online medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were profits being made that I would assume the casual
viewer would not recognize,'' he said. ``For someone who's looking
for important medical points, not reading every line, it would be
difficult to determine there was a conflict of interest there.''
</P>
<P>
   Koop, who lives in New Hampshire, was not available for comment.
Executives at drkoop.com say the site has always fully disclosed
its sponsors, but last month it took steps to further separate
advertising and content on the site and change wording to clarify
the nature of paid partnerships with health-care companies,
including hospitals. The company also killed an arrangement to pay
royalties on commercial activity on the site to Koop, known to many
Americans as a tough, unimpeachable advocate for the public's
health.
</P>
<P>
   Koop, meanwhile, is helping form an industry group that will
create a code of ethics for the e-health industry. Other sites are
already posting their advertising policies, hoping to avoid
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're being extremely oriented towards disclosure
now,'' said Dennis Upah, drkoop.com's chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   GROWING POPULARITY
</P>
<P>
   Chalk it up to dissatisfaction with rushed doctor's visits or
just our growing reliance on the Internet for information: Health
care is one of the hottest topics on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   By some estimates, 25,000 sites on the Internet offer
information on health and medical conditions. Last month, more than
13 million people logged onto Internet health sites, according to a
study released recently by research group PC Data Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a rapid transition where people have a hunger for
medical knowledge, and I think many of us are frustrated with our
ability to provide that with the level of validity that the
patients want,'' said Morehead of the Scott &AMP; White Health Plan.
``I look at it in a sense as an experiment in society as to how
best to provide valid information to help them make up their
minds.''
</P>
<P>
   The entities behind major health sites vary from prestigious
medical centers such as the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota and M.D.
Anderson Cancer Center in Houston to for-profit companies like
drkoop.com and Healthanswers.com in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   (Austin360.com, a sister company to the Austin
American-Statesman, runs health information purchased from a
variety of companies. The Seton HealthCare Network also pays to be
the local sponsor of health content.)
</P>
<P>
   To grow quickly, most commercial sites have built business by
signing up partners, now the established way of expanding your
audience on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Drkoop.com may be the best case study of how to build a
successful commercial health site.
</P>
<P>
   There, partners such as America Online and the GO Network
provide ready audiences of millions of subscribers who want
consumer health information, and they link to health-care sites
from their well-trafficked gateways. With an audience in place,
drugstore chains, insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies and
clinical trials companies rush to sign up as partners and place ads
or sponsorships on the site.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that a site that didn't exist 15 months ago now
has numerous partners promoting it online and off, many of them
paying for the privilege. Local television stations run commercials
for drkoop.com and exchange medical information and health stories
with the site. The maker of Nicorette and Nicoderm, two smoking
cessation products, sponsors the section on ``Tackling Tobacco'' on
drkoop.com. The sponsorships, like those on other sites, are
clearly labeled.
</P>
<P>
   But when about 20 hospitals _ including Scott &AMP; White _ showed
up on drkoop.com's list of preferred ``Community Partners,''
without noting that they had paid to be on the list, the AMA cried
foul. A company spokeswoman said the wording of that page was
changed around Aug. 20.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at drkoop.com say they keep content and advertising
as separate as church and state, won't accept content from
advertisers and routinely turn down advertising from companies they
feel are disreputable. Other sites, such as healthanswers.com,
intelihealth.com and onhealth.com, have similar policies.
</P>
<P>
   The AMA wants sites to go out of their way to delineate paid
advertising and medical information or advice and let consumers
know which is which.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing out there that says that Dr. Koop can't make
money giving advice on a Web site,'' said Tenery. ``That's not the
question. It all goes back to one thing and that's disclosure.''
Major commercial health sites say their content is evaluated by
doctors and noted to show where it came from.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that isn't always the case.
</P>
<P>
   On healthanswers.com, for instance, only the fine print tells
the source of entries in its ``library,'' and there is no mention
of who wrote the content, who reviewed it or when it was updated.
The information is purchased from the medical encyclopedia adam.com
and reviewed by doctors there, company officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, on drkoop.com, pages about such conditions as asthma,
endometriosis and HIV are credited only to the company and do not
detail who wrote or reviewed them. The company says it is reviewed
by doctors at Dartmouth Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   In online support groups and message boards common on many
health sites, information flows more freely and usually is posted
by lay people, not doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hosts know that they're not an authority, they're not a
counselor, they're not a physician,'' said Todd Woodward,
drkoop.com's executive community producer. ``Whatever you hear here
is not authoritative. But there's always going to be people sharing
Grandma's remedy for a sore knee or whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   With health sites treading closer to the territory of doctors,
they know they will have to be more careful because they will be
judged on their content, not their ability to attract attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we feel our way along some of those bumpy points,
drkoop.com got called on some things that are not way over the edge
but certainly questionable,'' said Bob Pringle, president of
intelihealth.com, an online venture between insurance giant
Aetna/US Healthcare and Johns Hopkins Medical School. ``That
doesn't mean that people couldn't point fingers. You live in a
glass house you have to be careful about throwing stones.''

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service AUSTIN, Texas _ Q: For vacation, a
<TEXT>
friend and I want to visit Indian reservations. I have heard it is
possible to be given an American Indian name. Is this a practice of
any particular reservation? Are there any reservations in Texas? _
L. Ferrell
<P>
   A: Think twice before participating in such an event. If you do
find a reservation with a naming ceremony for tourists, its value
will be pure entertainment, says David Pego, Texas delegate to the
White House Conference on Indian Education. (Sometimes a naming is
done by unscrupulous, fake spiritual leaders who might not be real
Native Americans.) Names are generally given only to tribal
members, and some communities prohibit members from disclosing
their Native American names to outsiders. Four tribes are found on
three federally recognized Texas reservations: the Kickapoos, near
the border city of Eagle Pass; the Alabama and Coushatta tribes,
near Livingston; and the Tiguas, a reservation surrounded by the
city of El Paso. New Mexico has more than 20 reservations, mostly
small pueblo-style villages, technically federal reservations.
While Oklahoma is home to more than 30 tribes, the state contains
no reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read that a CD-ROM based on the book ``Native and
Naturalized Woody Plants of Austin and the Hill Country'' has been
developed by a professor and was being given to schools in the
Austin Independent School District. Is this available to the
public? My husband would really like to own one.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lynn McCree
</P>
<P>
   A: The CD-ROM is available at a number of retail locations such
as AusTex Garden and Nursery, Borders, Book People, the Lady Bird
Johnson Wildflower Center, the Natural Gardener (formerly
Garden-Ville), Southwestern University Bookstore, and Wild Basin
Wilderness Preserve (members pay $17.95). A complete list of
locations is available at www.flash.net/(tilde)waittd. CDs sell for
$24.95 ($19.95 for schoolteachers). Green thumbs will enjoy this
interactive guide to the identification of 142 trees, shrubs and
woody vines of Central Texas. A portion of the proceeds from the
Woody Plants CD-ROM goes to the Brother Daniel Lynch scholarship
fund at St. Edward's University. Q: I would like the following
information about the famous Hail Mary pass from Staubach to
Pearson: the team name, the score, the game date. A pound of
Starbucks coffee is riding on this. _ Lee G.
</P>
<P>
   A: Ahhhhh the Dallas Cowboys, my team _ even in the lean years.
The Hail Mary pass _ so named by quarterback Roger Staubach in an
interview after this Dec. 28, 1975, game _ sailed 50 yards. Prayers
work wonders. The opposing team was the Minnesota Vikings in this
National Football league division playoff. The Cowboys won 17-14.
Sports aficionados tell me Drew Pearson caught the pass between his
right elbow and hip. Q: I cannot find Evian (eau mineral natural)
``brumisateur'' spray water. I used to get it at Saks Fifth Avenue,
which doesn't keep it anymore. I love spraying it on my face._ Jean
Thagdard
</P>
<P>
   A: Check again. Upscale stores such as Saks, as well as a few
pharmacies, carry Evian spray (5 oz. bottle retails for $8.50). The
spray, powered by ozone-friendly nitrogen oxide gas, can be applied
on or under makeup, and provides cool H20 relief in the Texas heat.
Evian therapy originally comforted burn patients in France.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We recently purchased a house that has a kitchen counter top
set on a rock base. The stone leaves a fine white residue when
touched. It is particularly annoying when we or our guests sit at
the counter, and the residue rubs off on our clothing. How might we
rectify this problem? _ Gilbert L. Blount
</P>
<P>
   A: The rock needs to be sealed and I am surprised the builder
did not do this. Sealing is a fairly simple task. You can do
yourself, says veteran rock worker Carlos Bazan of Renaissance
Stone Design. Pick up a clear, silicone-based sealer at any home or
hardware store. Clean the rock work. Apply the sealer with a paint
sprayer or a sponge. It dries in a couple of hours. Q: Is there
such a thing as a $1 million bill? How would you cash one? _ Sam B.
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes there is such a thing, but no, you can't cash it.It was
minted by a Canadian firm as a collectible (Canadian for ``worth
nothing''). This certificate, known as the ``One Million Dollar
Special Issue,'' originally sold for $1. The largest denomination
ever printed by the United States was the $100,000 Gold
Certificate. This 1934 bill featured President Wilson and existed
only for transactions in Federal Reserve Banks. Q: I sneeze with
such verve and gusto that people within a 10-foot radius swear they
feel the earth move underfoot. Why don't we sneeze when we sleep?
Can it be to keep our sleeping partners from committing homicide? _
D.R.C.
</P>
<P>
   A: Bless you! ``Reflexes are reduced when sleeping, so you do
not sneeze,'' guesses Dr. Neil Miller at Capital Ear Nose and
Throat Clinic. Lots of folks control the sneezing reflex with
various forms of concentration _ staring at a light, rubbing the
nose, pressing on the upper lip. Sleeping sounds better, though.
</P>
<P>
   Upshot/Update/Uproar:
</P>
<P>
   _ Readers who appreciated the instructions on how to iron a
shirt (OK, so they sent the item to their children for reference)
will appreciate these tips on pressing pants from Hamilton Beach
small appliance manufacturer. Lay the sides of pockets on the
ironing board to press them (avoid that bulky pocket outline). Next
slide the waistline over the ironing board and iron the top of the
pants. Rotate to cover all sections. Lay the pants legs flat (one
on top of the other). Iron the inside of the pant leg making sure
to align inseams. Fold back the top leg, iron. Flip and repeat.
Finally tackle the outside of the pants legs. For more tips, visit
www.hamiltonbeach.com or call (800) 851-8900.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reader Joyce Wilson reports her husband's success cleaning a
scorched stainless steel pan: Turtle Wax rubbing compound. Add a
lot of elbow grease. The burned-on, scorched metal was once again
shiny bright. Anything to save a favorite pan.

 &HT;    Microsoft's Word 98 a great deal
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You don't often get deals like this from software
giant Microsoft, which is also the largest developer of Macintosh
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The company is offering its popular word processor at a
two-thirds discount. And it's throwing in tons of new stuff to
boot.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, Word 98, which is also part of the Microsoft
Office suite, was selling for around $330 in the Mac catalogs as a
stand-alone product.
</P>
<P>
   Now Microsoft is offering the same program, with some added
templates, for $99 (after the mailing of a $30 rebate card). The
marketing pitch is that this version of Word is for iMac and iBook
users. But Word 98 Special Edition, as it is called, will work with
any Power Mac.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect, but don't know as a fact, that Microsoft lowered the
price to compete against a handful of challengers that have lowered
prices or offered free versions of their word processors.
</P>
<P>
   WordPerfect, for example, is now available for free via the
Internet. This program offers about 80 percent of Word's features
and was at one time Microsoft's leading competitor in the Mac word
processing market. You'll find this download at
www.corel.com/products
</P>
<P>
   /macintosh/wpmac35/packfreedownload
</P>
<P>
   .htm.
</P>
<P>
   Nisus Writer, another first-rate word processor, is also
offering a free download of an earlier version of itself. This
program still has features, such as maintaining multiple
clipboards, that the Mac version of Word has yet to offer.
</P>
<P>
   While Nisus Writer and WordPerfect are each excellent programs,
Microsoft's current offering on Word is hard to beat.
</P>
<P>
   For one, whether you like it or not, Word is the word processing
standard, especially in the office. Word 98 is probably the best
Mac version Microsoft has ever produced.
</P>
<P>
   Word 98 finally supports full drag-and-drop technology. It also
incorporates the look and feel of Apple Computer's latest operating
system, OS 8. It sports OS 8's platinum look, contextual menus and
extensive interactive help.
</P>
<P>
   Word even adds some small but handy innovations of its own.
Among the better ones are buttons that let you easily jump from
page to page, chart to chart or graphic to graphic.
</P>
<P>
   Another powerful feature is the document map, which lets you
easily navigate a book or report through an outline. Other features
include buttons that let you highlight text with a yellow marker
and add comments that appear only when you place your cursor over
marked text.
</P>
<P>
   Now, to sweeten the pot, Microsoft is throwing in with its
special edition of Word thousands of clip art images. There are
also 100 greeting card templates.

 &HT;    Welcome to the new 'hood, and network
 &HT;    By Gerry Yandel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Normally, I hate moving.
</P>
<P>
   But this time it was different: I knew a computer network was
hidden in my walls, and it was just dying to be used.
</P>
<P>
   The Cat 5 cable snaking behind the Sheetrock all but screamed at
me while I puttered around, redistributing the contents of unpacked
boxes, shuffling furniture, hanging towel bars and installing
blinds.
</P>
<P>
   After a few weeks, when we could see parts of the floor between
the piles of belongings, I could contain myself no longer: I had to
test out my wiring and fire up the ethernet.
</P>
<P>
   Without really meaning to, I found myself standing in the
networking aisle of the local CompUSA debating quantity vs.
quality.
</P>
<P>
   Quality won out, in no small part because of the e-mails several
readers sent warning me against the perils of skimping on my NICs
and hub. So, even though they were twice _ and in some cases thrice
_ as much as other products, I stuck with 3Com and Intel for my
hardware, just as you all suggested.
</P>
<P>
   About $300 later, I walked out with a four-port Intel hub, a
3Com 10/100 NIC for my main machine and a 3Com LAN PC card _ which
was the real big-ticket item at $180 _ for the laptop.
</P>
<P>
   When I got home with the goodies, I had a simple plan: Wire up
the P166, take the laptop around to all the network jacks in the
house and check the connections.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, I plan to set up a client-server network with a
proxy server to be able to share my Internet connection. But for my
tests I didn't need anything tricky or fancy. Both my machines use
Win95, and by all accounts setting up a peer-to-peer network was
supposed to be a snap.
</P>
<P>
   So I installed my NICs, plugged in the hub and promptly hit a
snag.
</P>
<P>
   I had no Network Neighborhood icon on my desktop.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of those annoying icons Windows won't let you remove
from the desktop. So, earlier, I had used a program called TweakUI
to get rid of it almost as soon as I bought my trusty old P166 a
couple of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Once I restored the icon to its preordained place, the first
step was to make sure I had all the necessary clients, adapters and
protocols installed in my network settings.
</P>
<P>
   The Client for Microsoft Networks, Client for Netware Networks,
and file and printer sharing software was already installed by
default. There was also the dial-up adapter, which was put in when
I configured TCP/IP through Win95, and my new 3Com adapter was
listed as well.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good.
</P>
<P>
   Now to check the protocols.
</P>
<P>
   Small LANs like mine, which could have up to eight ports if Mrs.
Power User lets me put machines in the kitchen and dining room
(yeah, right), only really need to deal with three protocols in the
networking preferences: TCP/IP, for the Internet; IPX/SPX, used by
many games for speedy LAN play; and NetBUI for LAN file and printer
sharing.
</P>
<P>
   A TCP protocol was already set up for the dial-up adapter, and a
second TCP protocol appeared that was bound to my 3Com ethernet
card.
</P>
<P>
   Adding protocols is no more difficult than clicking on ``Add''
and finding them under the subsequent choices for Microsoft. There
can be some confusion when two protocols of each type appear in the
list, but one is for the dial-up adapter and one is for the NIC.
</P>
<P>
   The only real configuration needed is for the TCP/IP protocol,
which requires that each machine on the network have a unique IP
address, such as 10.0.0.1 for computer 1, 10.0.0.2 for computer 2,
etc. If your Internet service provider uses dynamic IP addressing,
which most of them do, you will want to leave the TCP bound to the
dial-up adapter alone and only specify IP addresses for the TCP
bound to your network card. (Also, make sure you don't enable file
sharing on your dial-up TCP protocol, which would open up your
drives _ and printer _ to the Internet.)
</P>
<P>
   Next, click the ``File and Print Sharing'' button and check the
box for sharing files. If you have a printer attached to the
machine, click the other box for printer sharing.
</P>
<P>
   The last step is to click the ``Identification'' tab to give the
machine a name and assign it to a work group, which should be the
same for all machines on a small network.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you will have to set up the network preferences for
each machine on your LAN, but that's part of the fun of being a
systems administrator, isn't it? Some more fun of being a sysadmin
is that Win95 makes you reboot every time you change anything in
your network preferences, which gets real annoying real quickly.
</P>
<P>
   All that remains is to go into Windows Explorer and right click
on each drive you want to share, give it a unique name and set the
sharing permissions to full access. Ditto for each printer.
</P>
<P>
   In my case, the whole process _ annoying reboots and testing all
my jacks notwithstanding _ took little over an hour. It would have
taken less except the laptop couldn't find my printer and I spent
20 minutes before I realized the printer wasn't on. (Hey, calling
this column Power User wasn't my idea.)
</P>
<P>
   Although file and print sharing is nice, the real reason for a
peer-to-peer home network is, of course, multiplayer gaming. (You
need a client-server setup with one machine as a proxy server to
share a modem on a LAN.)
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, the first thing I did was to set up network
versions of some of my favorites: ``Quake II,'' ``Hexen II'' and
``Dungeon Keeper.''
</P>
<P>
   But my elation at my in-home game network was quickly snuffed
out ... when I realized the only multiplayer gaming I was going to
be doing was running between room to room making my Paladin punch
my Necromancer and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Because, I am sure Mrs. Power User would take a dim view of
recruiting our daughter Emily into a Hexen Deathmatch ... at least
until she turns 6.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ The battle over which company will control the desktop
computer _ a battle many experts have long believed Microsoft
already won _ is about to heat up again. Many new challengers are
vying to replace Microsoft's Windows operating system. Read about
these systems and their chances for victory in the October issue of
PC World.
</P>
<P>
   Among the operating systems covered are BeOS 4.5 and Linux. The
magazine also takes a close look at the upcoming versions of
Windows, scheduled for release next year.
</P>
<P>
   It's list time again, and some of Atlanta's top entrepreneurs
have made Digitalsouth magazine's top high-tech entrepreneurs.
Topping the list in the October issue is Bert Ellis Jr., the
45-year-old chairman and chief executive of iXL Enterprises. Other
Atlantans on the list are WebMD founder Jeff Arnold, MindSpring
founder Charles Brewer and Media Metrix Vice Chairman Jeff Levy.
</P>
<P>
   ON CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has a great deal for Mac users.
</P>
<P>
   The company released its popular Word writing program in a new
package for iMac and iBook users. Called Word 98 Special Edition,
the package includes thousands of new clip art images and 100 new
greeting card templates, as well as Microsoft's free Web browser
and e-mail programs.
</P>
<P>
   The package retails for $99, about $200 less than previously
released versions of Word 98.
</P>
<P>
   First it was in movie theaters, then on computer screens. Now
you can experience George Lucas' ``Phantom Menace'' on Sony
PlayStation. LucasArts Entertainment has released a video game
based on the latest ``Star Wars'' movie.
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE
</P>
<P>
   The latest news organization to join the Year 2000 bandwagon is
the Public Broadcasting System.
</P>
<P>
   Its member stations have run a series of stories about the
millennium bug and the potential problems it may cause. You can
read transcripts of these stories, view video clips from them and
research general information about Y2K at a special site PBS has
set up.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find the site at www.pbs.org/y2kontarget/.

 &HT;    Web cam watchers can see a lot
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Web cams, one guesses, are a lot like a NASCAR race:
People watch to see something interesting happen.
</P>
<P>
   With a half-day race, it might be a wreck. With Web cams, the
most popular of which broadcasts live shots of a woman's bedroom,
it's nudity.
</P>
<P>
   The October issue of Yahoo Internet Life magazine profiles the
33-year-old woman behind Anacam.com. Since 1997, when Ana put a
camera in her bedroom and broadcast images of her and her boyfriend
having sex, Anacam.com has attracted more and more visitors. She
estimates receiving up to 22,000 viewers every day.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet Life issue also includes lists of Web cameras that
aren't trained on people. One site, www.windows2000.com, is a
compilation of Web cameras divided by state. At www.earthcam.com,
things are organized by subject: traffic cameras, weather cameras,
scenic cameras, and weird and bizarre cameras.
</P>
<P>
   The new issue also lists one Web site serving a niche market:
wired truckers. The site, www.drivernet.com, lists each of its 375
e-mail terminals at truck stops in the continental United States.
The service is free, and it gives truckers a free e-mail address to
use while on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Internet Life also examines free Internet connections. Companies
like Microworkz, AltaVista and NetZero offer free connections to
anyone willing to sift through advertising. All you America Online
users might be thinking, ``Hey, I'm already sifting through ads,
and I'm paying $21.95 a month for it.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The free ISP service requires you to download software and
register. Once enrolled, a user sees advertisements on his or her
PC screen the whole time they're on the already-ad-riddled
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Europe, the services apparently are selling well. But
Americans have been less likely to be moved to save $10 to $20 a
month while seeing even more online advertising.
</P>
<P>
   _ The magazine also helps you tell the difference between a bad
e-mailer and a good one. A good e-mailer sends you only the files
you asked for. A bad e-mailer sends you the ``Best Net Jokes of
1998'' with a Microsoft Word virus attached. A bad e-mailer catches
up by writing a simple, ``Hi ... what's up? Write me when you have
a chance.'' A bad e-mailer sends ``a tacky e-mail greeting showing
a) a furry white kitten, b) a hot-air balloon, and c) a kitten in a
hot-air balloon.''
</P>
<P>
   RING OUT THE MILLENNIUM AT TIMES SQUARE SITE
</P>
<P>
   If fear of the Y2K bug is keeping you landlocked this New Year's
Eve and you don't feel like driving to New York, the Internet might
be the next best thing.
</P>
<P>
   A site, www.timessquare.com/, which was scheduled to open last
week, hopes to be the gathering place for people who can't make it
to Times Square and can't watch the ball drop on television.
</P>
<P>
   The site will broadcast the New Year's Eve celebration,
including the lowering of the ball. In the spring, the site will
become TimesSquareAlive.com, an entertainment and information site.
</P>
<P>
   The site is expected to feature online auctions, ticket sales
and Times Square merchandise. Earthcam.com will place cameras at
different points on Times Square and broadcast the images on the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers also hope to:
</P>
<P>
   _ Broadcast the New Year's Eve midnight celebrations in Paris,
London, Tokyo and Cairo, Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   _ Offer a contest asking the question, ``What are you planning
to do in the last 60 seconds of the millennium?'' Prizes include
New Year's Eve travel packages.
</P>
<P>
   _ Offer the ability to chat and message during the New Year's
Eve celebration. Some messages will be broadcast on the big video
screens in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   BUYING PROTECTION FOR ONLINE PURCHASES
</P>
<P>
   Interested in taking advantage of the price and convenience of
Internet shopping but still leery about buying something you
haven't touched? A company, WebAssured.com, is offering purchase
protection for merchants and shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   The company, located at www.webassured.com, is offering what it
claims is the Internet's first online purchase-protection program.
The protection offer is underwritten by Lloyd's of London.
</P>
<P>
   The site includes places where people can make laudatory
comments about online retailers as well as post warnings about
shady companies.

 &HT;    When HTML fails, there's always solitaire
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Robert Rogers e-mails me with an interesting computer
problem. The reason it is interesting, incidentally, is because (1)
It might happen to you and (2) I happen to know the answer. I get a
lot of questions that aren't of much interest, because although (1)
It might happen to you, (2) I don't have a clue about how to fix
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a Gateway G6-300 computer, equipped with Windows 98 and
the Word 97 word processor,'' Mr. Rogers writes. ``My problem stems
from opening e-mail and other text from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``By opening it, I mean that sometimes I save e-mail news
articles and other information in my computer. Sometimes, it is a
hassle trying to open some of this information, and sometimes, the
documents will not open at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I save a file is that I go to the File function on the
toolbar, and to Save As on the dropdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the save window, I save in `My Documents' and as HTML
files. The files save, but when I try to open them with Word 97, a
lot of them won't open. Am I doing something wrong, or is there a
better way of saving files off the Internet?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, Mr. Rogers, the only surprise here is that any of them
open. As best I recall, an HTML reader was an add-on feature for
early versions of Word 97. You had to download it, and it would
attach itself to the word processor. Otherwise, Word 97 would be
unlikely to open any HTML file.
</P>
<P>
   HTML, of course, is hypertext code, the simple language with
which Web sites are written.
</P>
<P>
   All you need do is save the file as text instead of HTML. Then
you should be able to open it as a text file.
</P>
<P>
   You can also, obviously, open an HTML file with the browser that
saved it. Just use the Open command in the File menu.
</P>
<P>
   I am getting more and more message attachments couched in HTML.
It's really an aggravation, because Lotus Notes, perhaps the most
misbegotten program ever inflicted upon an unsuspecting public in
the last few years, won't read HTML. For that matter, I don't
believe the e-mail program I use at home _ Eudora _ reads it
either. Most of these messages, I imagine, come from folks using
Navigator or Explorer to send messages.
</P>
<P>
   I'm still getting the occasional epistle regarding solitaire.
</P>
<P>
   Remember Bunny? She's the lady who told me you haven't lived
until you've run up a big score turning one card at a time. I don't
remember what that score was, but Joy Cawley does.
</P>
<P>
   Joy asks me to tell Bunny that ``I play solitaire against the
clock with the three-card turnover and my best score to date is
8,704 in 87 seconds. She should definitely give it a try.''
</P>
<P>
   I've never played one-card turnover solitaire, which sounds kind
of like shooting fish in a barrel, but neither do I play against
the clock or watch the score. I have other things to do for
excitement, such as remembering the way to work every morning. I
play solitaire to relax and contemplate the nature of the universe
and the question of why, after all, frogs weren't given wings to
avoid all that wear and tear on their posteriors.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service AUSTIN, Texas _ Q: For vacation, a
<TEXT>
friend and I want to visit Indian reservations. I have heard it is
possible to be given an American Indian name. Is this a practice of
any particular reservation? Are there any reservations in Texas? _
L. Ferrell
<P>
   A: Think twice before participating in such an event. If you do
find a reservation with a naming ceremony for tourists, its value
will be pure entertainment, says David Pego, Texas delegate to the
White House Conference on Indian Education. (Sometimes a naming is
done by unscrupulous, fake spiritual leaders who might not be real
Native Americans.) Names are generally given only to tribal
members, and some communities prohibit members from disclosing
their Native American names to outsiders. Four tribes are found on
three federally recognized Texas reservations: the Kickapoos, near
the border city of Eagle Pass; the Alabama and Coushatta tribes,
near Livingston; and the Tiguas, a reservation surrounded by the
city of El Paso. New Mexico has more than 20 reservations, mostly
small pueblo-style villages, technically federal reservations.
While Oklahoma is home to more than 30 tribes, the state contains
no reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read that a CD-ROM based on the book ``Native and
Naturalized Woody Plants of Austin and the Hill Country'' has been
developed by a professor and was being given to schools in the
Austin Independent School District. Is this available to the
public? My husband would really like to own one.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lynn McCree
</P>
<P>
   A: The CD-ROM is available at a number of retail locations such
as AusTex Garden and Nursery, Borders, Book People, the Lady Bird
Johnson Wildflower Center, the Natural Gardener (formerly
Garden-Ville), Southwestern University Bookstore, and Wild Basin
Wilderness Preserve (members pay $17.95). A complete list of
locations is available at www.flash.net/(tilde)waittd. CDs sell for
$24.95 ($19.95 for schoolteachers). Green thumbs will enjoy this
interactive guide to the identification of 142 trees, shrubs and
woody vines of Central Texas. A portion of the proceeds from the
Woody Plants CD-ROM goes to the Brother Daniel Lynch scholarship
fund at St. Edward's University. Q: I would like the following
information about the famous Hail Mary pass from Staubach to
Pearson: the team name, the score, the game date. A pound of
Starbucks coffee is riding on this. _ Lee G.
</P>
<P>
   A: Ahhhhh the Dallas Cowboys, my team _ even in the lean years.
The Hail Mary pass _ so named by quarterback Roger Staubach in an
interview after this Dec. 28, 1975, game _ sailed 50 yards. Prayers
work wonders. The opposing team was the Minnesota Vikings in this
National Football league division playoff. The Cowboys won 17-14.
Sports aficionados tell me Drew Pearson caught the pass between his
right elbow and hip. Q: I cannot find Evian (eau mineral natural)
``brumisateur'' spray water. I used to get it at Saks Fifth Avenue,
which doesn't keep it anymore. I love spraying it on my face._ Jean
Thagdard
</P>
<P>
   A: Check again. Upscale stores such as Saks, as well as a few
pharmacies, carry Evian spray (5 oz. bottle retails for $8.50). The
spray, powered by ozone-friendly nitrogen oxide gas, can be applied
on or under makeup, and provides cool H20 relief in the Texas heat.
Evian therapy originally comforted burn patients in France.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We recently purchased a house that has a kitchen counter top
set on a rock base. The stone leaves a fine white residue when
touched. It is particularly annoying when we or our guests sit at
the counter, and the residue rubs off on our clothing. How might we
rectify this problem? _ Gilbert L. Blount
</P>
<P>
   A: The rock needs to be sealed and I am surprised the builder
did not do this. Sealing is a fairly simple task. You can do
yourself, says veteran rock worker Carlos Bazan of Renaissance
Stone Design. Pick up a clear, silicone-based sealer at any home or
hardware store. Clean the rock work. Apply the sealer with a paint
sprayer or a sponge. It dries in a couple of hours. Q: Is there
such a thing as a $1 million bill? How would you cash one? _ Sam B.
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes there is such a thing, but no, you can't cash it.It was
minted by a Canadian firm as a collectible (Canadian for ``worth
nothing''). This certificate, known as the ``One Million Dollar
Special Issue,'' originally sold for $1. The largest denomination
ever printed by the United States was the $100,000 Gold
Certificate. This 1934 bill featured President Wilson and existed
only for transactions in Federal Reserve Banks. Q: I sneeze with
such verve and gusto that people within a 10-foot radius swear they
feel the earth move underfoot. Why don't we sneeze when we sleep?
Can it be to keep our sleeping partners from committing homicide? _
D.R.C.
</P>
<P>
   A: Bless you! ``Reflexes are reduced when sleeping, so you do
not sneeze,'' guesses Dr. Neil Miller at Capital Ear Nose and
Throat Clinic. Lots of folks control the sneezing reflex with
various forms of concentration _ staring at a light, rubbing the
nose, pressing on the upper lip. Sleeping sounds better, though.
</P>
<P>
   Upshot/Update/Uproar:
</P>
<P>
   _ Readers who appreciated the instructions on how to iron a
shirt (OK, so they sent the item to their children for reference)
will appreciate these tips on pressing pants from Hamilton Beach
small appliance manufacturer. Lay the sides of pockets on the
ironing board to press them (avoid that bulky pocket outline). Next
slide the waistline over the ironing board and iron the top of the
pants. Rotate to cover all sections. Lay the pants legs flat (one
on top of the other). Iron the inside of the pant leg making sure
to align inseams. Fold back the top leg, iron. Flip and repeat.
Finally tackle the outside of the pants legs. For more tips, visit
www.hamiltonbeach.com or call (800) 851-8900.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reader Joyce Wilson reports her husband's success cleaning a
scorched stainless steel pan: Turtle Wax rubbing compound. Add a
lot of elbow grease. The burned-on, scorched metal was once again
shiny bright. Anything to save a favorite pan.

 &HT;    Take my advice, Kelley, curb your ego
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Dear David E. Kelley:
</P>
<P>
   You've come down with a nasty case of Big Head Disease, and you
need to treat it before your considerable talents are wasted.
</P>
<P>
   I know, you probably don't give a hoot what some TV critic in
Texas thinks, but this advice is offered for your own good. Steven
Bochco came down with the same ailment a few years ago and, thanks
to serious critical drubbing, managed to shake it.
</P>
<P>
   What's the problem? You've become so used to people loving your
shows, watching your shows and showering your shows with awards
that you've lost your way. How else to explain Sunday night's awful
season opener of ``The Practice'' and the arrival this season of
``Snoops,'' the closest thing to ``Charlie's Angels'' we've seen in
years.
</P>
<P>
   Usually I like your work, and I think your writing _ lovingly
and laboriously scribbled long-hand on legal pads _ is often
brilliant. Nobody is better at crafting quirky plots and
multidimensional characters. ``Picket Fences'' had its moments, and
in the early going, ``Chicago Hope'' was superb. ``The Practice''
and ``Ally McBeal'' have become appointment viewingfor the adults
in my house.
</P>
<P>
   Last season's cliffhanger for ``The Practice'' was one of the
decade's best _ loaded with suspense, sparkling with humor and
chock full of warm-hearted sentiment. When Lindsay was stabbed in
the opening segment, fans were riveted, peeking at the scene
through trembling fingers.
</P>
<P>
   But this season's opener was disgusting. We wanted to know if
the nun-impersonating George Vogelman really hacked Lindsay or not.
Instead, we got a nauseating case involving Henry Winkler as a man
with a sexual fetish involving cockroaches, masturbation and a
murder victim with grape jelly in her mouth.
</P>
<P>
   And ``Snoops?'' What in the world were you thinking? High-tech
gadgets, leather-clad women with pounds of lip gloss are not the
stuff of great drama. They're not even the stuff of mildly
entertaining drama.
</P>
<P>
   That new half-hour version of ``Ally'' isn't such a swell move,
either. It smacks of greed, pure and simple. Hour-long series are
difficult to sell into syndication, so you're slapping together a
re-edited half-hour version to make a few more millions. Shouldn't
you be spending your time working on less disgusting scripts for
``The Practice?''
</P>
<P>
   When writer-producers reach a certain level of mega-power in
Hollywood, as you have _ with five series on the air this season
and two recent best drama and best comedy Emmys in your mansion _
they can do just about anything. You're a 10-ton gorilla if ever
there was one. ABC executives call you a ``brand-name producer,''
meaning even the common couch potato knows you and will watch a
show just because your name is on it. Network execs admit they are
predisposed to buy your pilots and then let you do anything that
strikes your fancy with them.
</P>
<P>
   But just because you can do anything doesn't mean you should.
Steven Bochco, lauded for his groundbreaking ``Hill Street Blues''
and ``L.A. Law,'' got such a serious case of Big Head Disease that
he assumed, correctly it turned out, that the networks would put on
any old thing he concocted. Hence came the dreadful police musical
``Cop Rock'' in 1990 and the odoriferous ``Public Morals,'' a cop
sitcom, in '96. The original pilot for ``Public Morals'' was so
crude it contained an appalling word for the female anatomy.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers, it turned out, did not have the same low standards as
network executives. Within a few months ``Cop Rock'' was gone, and
within a few weeks ``Public Morals'' disappeared, too, because
nobody was watching.
</P>
<P>
   You started in Hollywood as a writer for Bochco's ``L.A. Law.''
He's been your mentor, so learn from his mistakes. Don't
underestimate your audience. Don't assume that any old thing you
throw on the screen is art. And don't insult us by thinking we
can't tell the difference between the brilliant work you're capable
of and the shameful stuff.

 &HT;    Captain Underpants is back
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ That goofball hero is back in his third adventure:
``Captain Underpants and the Invasion of the Incredibly Naughty
Cafeteria Ladies From Outer Space (and the Subsequent Assault of
the Equally Evil Lunchroom Zombie Nerds)'' by Dav Pilkey
(Scholastic, $16.95 hardcover, $3.99 paper). The title is so long,
we don't have room to tell you much. Just know that an alien
spaceship has landed on the roof of Jerome Horwitz Elementary.
Aliens take over the cafeteria! Captain Underpants still doesn't
know what he's doing. Thank goodness fourth-graders George and
Harold come to the rescue!

 &HT;    Hope fades for quake victims
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After almost a week of searching for people buried by
a massive earthquake, Taiwanese officials are focusing on the
survivors. More than 100,000 people were left homeless by the
7.6-magnitude earthquake that struck the Southeast Asian island
last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some people said it could take months, if not years, for their
lives to return to normal. ``We're hoping the government will help
us rebuild our homes,'' said farmer Chen Jung, who lost his home.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwanese officials said last week more than 2,000 people were

   STUDY MEASURES VIOLENCE
</P>
<P>
   Everybody knows TV shows and movies can be violent, but a new
report tells just how prevalent it is.
</P>
<P>
   If you watched all 50 of last year's top-grossing films, you saw
more than 2,300 acts of violence, according to a study from the
Center for Media and Public Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   TV programming, both network and cable, averaged six scenes of
serius violence per episode of fiction series. And most movies and
TV series failed to show the physical or emotional harm that would
result from serious violence.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found music videos and feature films averaged a
scene of serious violence every four minutes.

   GEORGIA GIRL WINS NEW MODEL CONTEST
</P>
<P>
   First Augusta, then New York, now Paris. Martinez, Ga., teen
Erin McQuatters went from doing her very first modeling job last
spring to the cover of a special section in Seventeen magazine's
September issue. Now, the 14-year-old winner of the Chanel New
Model of the Year Contest is off to soak up all of the haute
couture (French for high fashion) that Paris has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought all of (the contest's eight finalists) had a really
good chance of winning,'' said Erin, who went to New York for the
finals. ``I was surprised, but I'm glad I won.''
</P>
<P>
   She's going to Paris in October, where she'll be treated to
front-row seats at a Chanel fall fashion show and a $1,000 shopping
spree.
</P>
<P>
   PANDAS DELAYED BY COMMUNIST CELEBRATION
</P>
<P>
   Yang-Yang and Lun-Lun are going to be late-late.
</P>
<P>
   But the delay for Zoo Atlanta's panda pair from China is
supposed to be only a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The pandas were scheduled to arrive Oct. 7. However, since the
Chinese are busy preparing for the 50th anniversary of the founding
of the Communist People's Republic of China, they can't meet the
date. Now, the pandas are expected to arrive in late October.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, you can ask questions about the exhibit and see
a video of Lun-Lun at www.accessatlanta.com/pandas/.

 &HT;    Signs of child abuse can go undetected
 &HT;    By Hap Lecrone
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Child abuse and neglect often go undetected,
leaving physical and emotional scars on the abused and neglected
child.
</P>
<P>
   These scars carry over into adulthood, often causing severe
psychological problems for the adult who was abused and/or
neglected in childhood and adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   Child abuse can be physical and/or sexual, and neglect can be
physical and/or emotional.
</P>
<P>
   A pattern of abuse may go undetected for years; sometimes,
throughout the victim's childhood and adolescence. The abused
child's family is often isolated, lacking close friends or
relatives, with little or no community involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Stressful events in the home are often precipitating factors and
may include marital strife, loss of job or housing, physical
fatigue of the caregiver, birth of a sibling, alcohol and drug
abuse, legal problems and major illness or psychiatric problems.
</P>
<P>
   Child-abusers are frequently lonely and unhappy individuals who
are angry and under pressure. Their lifestyles are often chaotic.
</P>
<P>
   Abusive parents often show little concern for their child's
problems and are unavailable for school conferences or when
assistance is offered to their children. They often delay seeking
medical attention for their child or display a history of switching
their child from doctor to doctor in order to avoid detection.
</P>
<P>
   Many child-abusers were abused children themselves and often
lack a healthy self-concept. They are frequently immature and lack
knowledge of healthy parenting skills. Generally speaking, however,
only one parent abuses the child; the other takes a supportive or
neutral role.
</P>
<P>
   Children most likely to be abused are often handicapped and/or
mentally challenged. They may exhibit low impulse control and
acting out tendencies _ often described as stubborn, inquisitive
and demanding and are frequently unwanted children.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the signs of physical abuse include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Bruises, often confined to the low back and buttocks of a
child.
</P>
<P>
   _ Finger and thumb prints on the arms or face.
</P>
<P>
   _ Slap marks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Adult-sized bite or choke marks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Restraint marks on the wrists or ankles.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bald spots where hair has been pulled out.
</P>
<P>
   _ Burn marks from cigarettes or hot water.
</P>
<P>
   _ Neurological injuries, often undetected by a layman. For
instance, violent shaking of a child can produce retinal
hemorrhage.
</P>
<P>
   _ A reluctance to change clothes for physical education classes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Preference for long sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chronic absence without reasonable explanations.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fear of other children or adults.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lack of happiness or joy in life.
</P>
<P>
   _ Problems in expressing anger or pain.
</P>

SHOW DOCTORS GIVE RETURNING PROGRAM A MAKEOVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON BARNHART  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ To the casual observer, the filming of a typical
television show is a slow, repetitive process, unless you happen to
be tagging along with the second unit of the CBS action hour
``Martial Law.''
</P>
<P>
   As the crew responsible for fight scenes and outdoor footage of
the show _ which kicks off (literally) its second season at 8
tonight on Channel 5 _ the second unit moves at least as quickly as
Sammo Hung, ``Martial Law's'' big-boned but unusually nimble star.
</P>
<P>
   Last season the second unit got a lot of credit for bringing the
excitement and tongue-in-cheek flair of the Hong Kong action genre
of films to an American TV series.
</P>
<P>
   But it's what came out of the first unit back at the studio,
where most of the dialogue and interior scenes were filmed, that
concerned executives at CBS. As entertaining as Hung could be to
watch _ backflipping off cars, beating foes senseless with a rubber
hose _ it was nearly as painful to see him attempt office chatter
in broken English with various miscast supporting players.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a popular but troubled program, the network ordered
radical changes to ``Martial Law.'' Those changes may alienate some
viewers at first but CBS believes they will ultimately make the
show appealing to a wider audience.
</P>
<P>
   Show-doctoring is a trend. All told, six broadcast networks
introduced just 35 new shows this season, the lowest total in
years. Industry observers cite two key reasons: more hourlong shows
and a dearth of new ideas . So instead, networks are choosing to
overhaul some of their middling programs rather than risk adding
more new shows, 70 percent of which, on average, fail.
</P>
<P>
   At NBC the network ordered surgery on three underperforming
comedies: ``Suddenly Susan,'' ``Jesse'' and ``Veronica's Closet.''
The latter two were actually top-10 shows last season, but only by
virtue of being hammocked between ``Friends,'' ``Frasier'' and
``ER'' on Thursday nights. Each show lost a large part of its
lead-in audience as the season went on.
</P>
<P>
   All three comedies hired new executive producers this summer to
run day-to-day operations. They in turn hired new cast members and
concocted new storylines to take their characters down unforeseen _
and presumably more amusing _ paths.
</P>
<P>
   For NBC Entertainment president Garth Ancier, the overhauls
became a necessity after concluding there were only two new
comedies ready for the fall season: ``Stark Raving Mad'' (which NBC
was contractually obliged to put on the air) and ``The Mike
O'Malley Show'' (which made its premiere Tuesday to disastrous
ratings).
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision I had to make,'' Ancier said, ``was, do we have
less comedy on NBC, which generally has been the heaviest comedy
network, or do we fix some of the shows that are not particularly
doing well and nurture them along for a year or two?''
</P>
<P>
   On ``Suddenly Susan,'' the fix involved pairing former ``Monty
Python'' player Eric Idle with the show's lead, Brooke Shields. On
``Jesse,'' new producers came over from two NBC hits ``Friends''
and ``Just Shoot Me'' and decided that Jesse (Christina Applegate)
should enroll in nursing school. On ``Veronica's Closet,'' the
incoming producers (also from ``Friends'') killed off Kirstie
Alley's love interest from last season.
</P>
<P>
   NBC also had to replace the lead of its Saturday-night thriller
``Profiler'' after Ally Walker asked out of her contract. Former
``Melrose Place'' star Jamie Luner takes Walker's place Oct. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Other shows being retooled are CBS' ``Chicago Hope'' (with half
the medical staff replaced) and ABC's ``Two Guys and a Girl''
(goodbye pizza place).
</P>
<P>
   In the case of ``Martial Law,'' CBS had debuted the show last
fall with low expectations on a safe night (Saturdays, when
viewership is low and CBS is strong). Another show, ``Touched by an
Angel,'' also was incubated on Saturdays (five years ago) and is
now a top-five show.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a kind of a natural evolution of a series,'' insists
CBS Entertainment president Nancy Tellem. ``It has a very solid
core audience. We wanted to build on that, and that's what we've
done in making adjustments to the show. Lee and Bill took it over
and they have some really fresh ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Goldberg and Bill Rabkin, the new executive producers, saw a
lot they didn't like last season on ``Martial Law,'' starting with
the cast.
</P>
<P>
   Two leads, Tom Wright and Louis Mandylor, were dropped. A new
female lead, Gretchen Egolf, was cast to play a by-the-book
supervisor. The other female lead, Kelly Hu, got a new wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   As Rabkin explains, ``Kelly was doing these amazing spreads in
Maxim and other magazines, proving herself one of the sexiest women
on the planet, and yet they'd turn on our show and see her dressed
like an insurance salesman.''
</P>
<P>
   Next, the producers went to work on Hung and his partner, former
talk-show host Arsenio Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arsenio started out as a publicist-turned-cop, which sort of
emasculated him from the start,'' Rabkin says. ``We wanted to make
Arsenio his equal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not so much of a wuss,'' Goldberg adds.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest changes concerned their rotund star and the
storylines involving him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt the show spotlighted Sammo's wonderful
skills, but it did so in a conventional, `T.J. Hooker' format,''
says Goldberg, referring to the 1980s William Shatner cop series.
``We wanted to come in and create a show as big and funny as Sammo
Hung and his fight sequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stories they were telling last year were the kind of
stories you could find on `Nash Bridges.' We wanted stories that
you could only find on `Martial Law.' ''
</P>
<P>
   As an example, Goldberg cites the episode that will air tonight.
In ``Sammo Blammo'' Hung finds himself attached to a bomb that will
go off if he stops moving. (``It's like the movie `Speed,' only
Sammo's the bus,'' Goldberg says.)
</P>
<P>
   The producers also decided Hung needed to lighten up _ referring
not to his heft but his personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were making Sammo out to be a Detective Sipowicz,'' says
Goldberg, referring to Dennis Franz's character on ``NYPD Blue'' on
ABC. ``No one tunes in to `Martial Law' to see Sammo interrogate a
perp.''
</P>
<P>
   Back on the set, Hung says he'll act more like a Chinese cop
resisting the ways of American law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the conflict,'' he says. ``I have my way, Terrell
(Hall's character) has his way, Gretchen has her own way.''
</P>
<P>
   I only get a few minutes at a time with Hung, since the second
unit is changing scenes so quickly. We're on the 28th floor of an
office building in downtown L.A., where the crew is methodically
shooting scenes for another episode in which Hung goes undercover
to bust a burglary ring. Set up, rehearse, take one, take two, pack
up, move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I make a movie, I make one fighting scene a month,'' Hung
tells me during another mini-interview. ``Takes 10 days, 15 days.
Now, takes only three hours, four hours.''
</P>
<P>
   The second unit just came off a two-day shoot aboard a train in
which it filmed 138 separate scenes, including 75 on one day.
</P>
<P>
   ``No show I've worked on has been this ambitious, bar none,''
says Jeff Cadiente, the show's stunt coordinator and an 18-year
stunt veteran. ``We're doing feature film stunts on a TV
schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our action sequences are better than any light-saber fight in
`The Phantom Menace,' '' says Goldberg. ``You don't need to spend
$7.50 and camp-out overnights. You just need to turn on your TV on
Saturday nights.''
</P>
<P>
   Hung, for one, is counting on it. After more than 25 years in
Hong Kong cinema (he had a part in Bruce Lee's final film in 1973),
the martial-arts star plans to hone his language skills and start a
feature-film career in the States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope everything this season is better than last season,'' he
says.

   WEBHEALTH _ In the hyperkinetic universe of Internet companies,
health care sites may be the fastest-rising stars. Young startups
such as Austin's Drkoop.com and healthanswers.com are fighting to
be your doctor's office on the Web and grab a share of the $1
trillion Americans spend on health care every year. They are
drawing hoards of money and the endorsement of some of the most
trusted names in medicine. But how useful are these sites?
Consider: They are mostly run by people who don't have medical
training. They offer frequent disclaimers urging that you seek a
doctor's advice if you have questions about a medical condition.
Most of them offer the same warehouses of well-known, general
information on diseases, first aid and prevention. Wire stories and
press releases from General Mills and Gatorade are presented as
``medical news,'' and fluffy stories on herbal remedies and keeping
cool in the summer abound. And in chat rooms and support groups,
Web surfers dispense health advice to each

   WEBHEALTH _ In the hyperkinetic universe of Internet companies,
health care sites may be the fastest-rising stars. Young startups
such as Austin's Drkoop.com and healthanswers.com are fighting to
be your doctor's office on the Web and grab a share of the $1
trillion Americans spend on health care every year. They are
drawing hoards of money and the endorsement of some of the most
trusted names in medicine. But how useful are these sites?
Consider: They are mostly run by people who don't have medical
training. They offer frequent disclaimers urging that you seek a
doctor's advice if you have questions about a medical condition.
Most of them offer the same warehouses of well-known, general
information on diseases, first aid and prevention. Wire stories and
press releases from General Mills and Gatorade are presented as
``medical news,'' and fluffy stories on herbal remedies and keeping
cool in the summer abound. And in chat rooms and support groups,
Web surfers dispense health advice to each

KEVIN SPACEY RECASTS HIS CAREER WITH COMPLEX ROLE IN `BEAUTY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT W. BUTLER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ ``I believe that you are in control of your own
destiny,'' Kevin Spacey said. ``It may just take awhile to convince
others.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider us convinced.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the 40-year-old actor's talent is in dispute. The
man already has a Tony Award and an Oscar on his mantel. And now
he's riding a wave of critical acclaim for his starring role, with
Annette Bening, in the film ``American Beauty,'' which opened
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But not too long ago Spacey feared that his movie career was in
a rut, that he'd played one too many of the evil, sleazy,
manipulative creeps who populate films like ``Consenting Adults,''
``Seven,'' ``Glengarry Glen Ross,'' ``Swimming With Sharks'' and
``The Usual Suspects.''
</P>
<P>
   His answer was to blow off any more roles that smacked of that
sinister persona and hold out for something that seemed completely
different. When the movie offers weren't to his liking he turned to
his longstanding ``rejuvenation program'' _ he did a stage play.
And not just any play. He tackled the role of Hickey in a London
production of Eugene O'Neill's ``The Iceman Cometh,'' a 41/2-hour
workout that is the acting equivalent of the Boston Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   And then in the summer of '98, during the ``Iceman'' run, Spacey
was sent a copy of the screenplay for ``American Beauty.'' He knew
he'd found what he was looking for in the character of Lester
Burnham. Lester is a suburban drone who contends with a job he
hates, a marriage without sex and a daughter who thinks he's the
world's biggest creep. Moreover, Lester entertains sexual fantasies
about a high school cheerleader.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I read it I recognized that this story was filled with
the concerns that lots of people find themselves thinking,'' the
actor said, relaxing recently in T-shirt and jeans in a deserted
hotel ballroom at the Toronto International Film Festival. ``We all
recognize the desire to break free of that kind of stifling
existence, to just one time experience life to its fullest. The
emotional terrain is something we all recognize, whether we'll
admit it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Spacey's performance in the film is so funny, sad and ultimately
uplifting that it was virtually impossible to find a critic at
Toronto who didn't think he'd get an Oscar nomination. The actor
said he was gratified by the festival kudos but admits he's lousy
at judging his own work.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I see one of my films for the first time, it's a very odd
experience. I don't see the movie. Instead I remember the day we
shot that scene, or ask why they cut at that point, or wonder if my
best scene is still going to be in the movie. It takes three or
four viewings before I can even approach it simply as a film
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling ``American Beauty'' the ``richest time I've ever had
working on a film,'' Spacey credited Alan Ball's multileveled
screenplay and the work of Sam Mendes, a first-time film director
but an old hand at creating hits for the theater (including the
current revival of ``Cabaret'' and ``The Blue Room'').
</P>
<P>
   ``We walked into this experience with a three-week rehearsal
period utilized brilliantly by Sam. It enabled me to find the level
of love that Lester once shared with his wife'' _ played by Bening
_ ``before it started crumbling. That was crucial to the film's
final moments, when Lester has to summon up all those lost
emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   Still angered by a 2-year-old Esquire article in which he was
described as gay, Spacey bristles when questions veer away from his
professional work: ``I never discuss my personal life.'' (For the
record, he was born in New Jersey, grew up in Chatsworth, Calif.,
and went to New York to study acting at the Juilliard School, where
he also got his start with Joseph Papp's Public Theater. He is
unmarried and shares his home outside New York City with two dogs.)
</P>
<P>
   But ask about the acting process and the words pour out. Spacey
particularly enjoys the period of discovery when he's learning
about a character and preparing for a role.
</P>
<P>
   ``My theater work is much closer to my life experience than
anything I've done in films,'' he said. ``And Lester is closer to
the kind of men I've played in the theater _ interesting and
complex. It was the sort of role that kept me moving to places I'd
never been before. For an actor, that's true joy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, I much prefer acting on the stage to film. As good as
a film performance may be, that's as good as it's ever gonna be.
With theater, though, you can grow, experiment, change. Every night
is a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'' was shot in the break between ``Iceman's''
London and Broadway runs, and Spacey found that Hickey and Lester
rubbed off on each other.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Iceman' was the finest experience I've ever had in the
theater. And in fact I couldn't have done `American Beauty' without
it. First, `Iceman' may be full of tragic elements, but it reminds
us that many of the most tragic things in life are just funny. That
was something I kept in mind throughout the making of this film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither `Iceman' nor `American Beauty' is downbeat despite the
seriousness of the themes they share, especially the search for
some kind of fellowship and humanity. In the end both Hickey and
Lester achieve an inner peace that surprises the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I returned to `Iceman' after making the movie, I really
believe that my Hickey was deeper and richer than before. There was
some Lester in him.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its art-film sensibilities, ``American Beauty'' was
produced by DreamWorks SKG, the Steven Spielberg-run studio best
known for releases like ``Deep Impact,'' ``Prince of Egypt'' and
``Saving Private Ryan.'' According to Spacey, Spielberg read Ball's
screenplay and announced, ``Let's make it and not water it down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This film shows incredible maturity and honesty in dealing
with hot-button issues, and DreamWorks should be applauded for
tackling it,'' Spacey said. ``It's a watershed because it
establishes the studio not just as a place where you make big
commercial movies but where you can also display an independent
frame of mind.''

   Don't giggle, although fans of Leslie Nielsen can be forgiven if
that's their first reaction upon learning that the deadpan funnyman
in ``Airplane'' and ``The Naked Gun'' movies is performing
``Clarence Darrow,'' a one-man play devoted to the legendary
defense attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen has encountered audience laughter before in the role of
Darrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened up in Canada about three years ago,'' he said
recently by phone from his hacienda-style home in Paradise Valley,
Ariz. ``They were laughing in crazy places. I realized it had to be
because they expected me to be funny.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nielsen won't be thinking about hearing titters at
inappropriate times when he takes the stage as Darrow.
</P>
<P>
   In fact he picked the stage to lessen the likelihood of
audiences connecting inadvertently with his comedic persona. ``If
people get a chance to see directly into my eyes, as they do on the
big screen, it tends to be easier for them to remember the dumb and
stupid guy, and that does provoke laughter. But on stage I'm
removed, and you can't really see my eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless his clothes fall off or a flower pot lands on his head,
audiences shouldn't have any trouble getting into Nielsen as
Darrow. The 73-year-old actor, who owns the play by David W.
Rintels, based on Irving Stone's book, Clarence Darrow for the
Defense, will be completely into his character.
</P>
<P>
   ``I supposed I would like to be like Clarence Darrow,'' Nielsen
said. ``I'm happy enough with who I am, but he had this incredible
ability to speak on any subject. Usually in debates he would take
the con side of the debate. He enjoyed facing, as he said, 500 to
1,000 people who were waiting for him to fall on his face.''
</P>
<P>
   Utilizing his love of high drama, Darrow made his lasting mark
as an eloquent defender of society's underdogs in courts across the
land, beginning in the late 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time of Darrow, courtrooms were an important form of
theater,'' said Doug Linder, a Darrowphile and professor of law at
the University of Missouri-Kansas City. ``People didn't have movies
to go to. They didn't have television shows to watch. What was
going on in courtrooms was the most compelling drama they could
get. And Darrow appealed to that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clarence Darrow'' exploits its namesake's penchant for broadly
passionate and poetic argument, including Darrow's famous defense
in 1925 of Tennessee science teacher John Scopes, who violated a
state law making it a crime to teach the theory of evolution in
schools.
</P>
<P>
   This summer the Kansas Board of Education decided to remove the
mandatory teaching of evolution in Kansas, making it possible for
schools to avoid the subject in the classroom altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen's take?
</P>
<P>
   ``Darrow would expect that,'' the actor said. ``He didn't hold
out too much hope for mankind in general.''
</P>
<P>
   Darrow summed up the Scopes trial, Nielsen said, ``when he said,
`If you can ban the teaching of evolution in the schools, then the
next year you can ban the teaching of religion in your church, and
after that you can burn newspapers and books. He said, `If you can
do the one, you can do the other.' And that's the point.''
</P>
<P>
   What's the point of Nielsen tackling stage drama when he
continues to have a lucrative comedy film career? The desire to
stretch himself. If anything, making people laugh has given him
greater confidence in all areas of his craft.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're doing insane comedy and you find out after the
smoke clears that you're still alive, that being an idiot and
absolutely dumb and stupid and really embarrassingly wacko didn't
hurt you at all, it means that you've broadened your horizons,'' he
said. ``And there's no reason why you can't carry that freedom into
your exploration of any character, including Clarence Darrow.''
</P>
<P>
   For decades Nielsen specialized in serious portrayals, dating
back to such 1950s leading-man movie roles as the spaceship
commander in ``Forbidden Planet'' and the available male in ``Tammy
and the Bachelor.'' In 1971 he was the cruise ship captain in ``The
Poseidon Adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was cast as an authority figure because I looked like it,''
he said. ``And maybe I went that direction as a young man because
it was a form of protection. It kept people from talking to me too
much, or they might have found out how dumb I really am.''
</P>
<P>
   But his career and life changed when he agreed to do a
self-parody of his screen image in the 1980 hit comedy
``Airplane!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd always been doing comedy,'' Nielsen said. ``I just never
knew that the drama I was doing was comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s and '90s, its been a steady stream of silly films
for Nielsen.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the comedies that I do, I'm having fun,'' he said. That
makes it harder, Nielsen said, ``to grind away at yourself in
drama. But you grind away because you're trying to find out what
... you're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month Nielsen completed shooting the comedy ``The Big Bang
3,'' due in theaters next summer. What happened to the first two
``Bangs''?
</P>
<P>
   ``We just simply said, `Well, we didn't like either one of them,
so we went on to No. 3,' '' he said, kidding. ``It's turning loose
a dumb and stupid law officer, but in this case turning him loose
in space as he investigates a dire plot by the alien to take over
the world. He creates all kinds of chaos as he is confronted by the
new technologies of science and so on, none of which he's equipped
to handle at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Where does Nielsen place himself on the space-time continuum of
comedy?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I don't know,'' he said. ``The only thing I'm happy about
is that I'm on the continuum. It dawned on me one day: `Leslie, you
have been part of ``Airplane'' and ``Naked Gun,'' and they are part
of American motion-picture comedy and will be through the history
of motion pictures.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Yet because of his comedy success, Nielsen concedes it might be
beyond his box-office reach to land another dramatic film role.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be difficult. It would depend on the role. But I do
`Darrow.' My choice today is to have fun and to do things that I
want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, being funny on screen has kept him young.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm only 18,'' Nielsen said. ``I tell you, I loved
`The Naked Gun' because, as far as the younger people were
concerned who were seeing the pictures, I wasn't over 30 and never
would be to them. And that's quite a compliment.''

CHRISTIAN AND DARWIN FISH SYMBOLS CONSTITUTE A CULTURAL CLASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EDWARD M. EVELD  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call it The Great American Fish War.
</P>
<P>
   It plays out on the backs of cars, pickups and SUVs. One side
displays the Christian fish symbol. The other also displays a fish
but one that has sprouted feet, the word ``DARWIN'' spelled out
inside the symbol to bring home the point.
</P>
<P>
   But what exactly is the message from the Darwin fish contingent?
</P>
<P>
   That's what Tom Lessl wanted to find out. He's an associate
professor of speech communication at the University of Georgia.
Even before the state school board debate over evolution erupted in
Kansas, he was walking parking lots in five states looking for
Darwin fish, distributing questionnaires.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wore out two pairs of shoes,'' Lessl said.
</P>
<P>
   Such emblems can be powerful statements, just like national
flags, and people invest their identities in them, he said. More
than that, the Darwin fish folks appropriated a religious symbol
and degraded it, Lessl said. That's potentially serious business.
</P>
<P>
   Early Christian believers were said to draw the outline of a
fish as a symbol of their beliefs. Letters in the Greek word for
fish form an acrostic for ``Jesus Christ, Son of God, Savior.''
</P>
<P>
   So, he wanted to know, is this an earnest war of some sort? Or
just a playful parody?
</P>
<P>
   He asked three questions: Why did you put this emblem on your
car? What audience did you hope to reach? What does the Darwin fish
mean to you? He distributed 140 surveys and got responses from more
than a third.
</P>
<P>
   According to the survey responses, a chief aim of the Darwin
fish people is, indeed, derision, Lessl said. Their assumption is
that people who put Christian fish emblems on their cars are
members of the Christian political right, who hold a spectrum of
conservative social and political views.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict was not so much about evolution vs. creationism, he
said, although some respondents did mention that debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is more religious culture against secular culture,''
Lessl said. ``It's very much a culture war.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Darwin fish people said they were offended by the public
display of the Christian symbol and considered the Darwin fish
their counterattack. Sixty-six percent of the respondents said
their target audience was ``Christians.''
</P>
<P>
   Said one respondent: ``I put the Darwin fish on my car for a
number of reasons. Mainly I did it to annoy the Christian right
wing, since they are so fond of putting the fish//Christ symbols on
their cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Many did say they displayed the Darwin fish to be funny, and
several said their purpose was not to attack any religious group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see how some people might feel hurt by the obvious play
on the traditional fish logo,'' said one. ``I can't speak for
everyone, but I don't see it as anything but lighthearted.''
</P>
<P>
   The Darwin fish has inspired a seemingly endless number of fish
mutations. There's a Sinner fish with horns, a spaceship-looking
Science fish, even a Gefilte fish. One emblem slaps back at the
Darwin fish by depicting a larger fish swallowing it.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Derechailo, a doctoral student in music at the
University of Missouri-Kansas City, was not part of Lessl's study,
but she was spotted recently with a Darwin fish on her blue Saturn.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian fish symbol annoyed her, she said, because it
seemed arrogant. She felt that people who displayed it were
pointing to themselves as being above the rest in a religious
sense. It reminded her of the Dr. Seuss story about the haughty,
star-bellied ``Sneetches,'' creatures who thought they were better
than regular Sneetches who lacked belly stars.
</P>
<P>
   For Derechailo, who considers herself a spiritual and religious
person, the Darwin fish was a way to counter that message. Plus,
she said, she thought it was a humorous way to take a jab at the
``conservative right wing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel like I was defiling someone else's symbol they
hold very dear,'' she said. ``It was more like a tweaking.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this has made Derechailo, like many others, a fish-emblem
watcher. One of the funniest she has seen depicts a figure erupting
out of a fish in an Edvard Munch-like pose, hands against the head.
</P>
<P>
   It could be we all need a good Scream.

MUST BABIES SLEEP SOLO? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERIC ADLER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For parents of babies and toddlers it's an ongoing debate: Is it
good to allow your baby to sleep in bed with you?
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say co-sleeping fosters trust, intimacy and
self-assuredness.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say babies taught to sleep on their own learn
self-calming skills and self-reliance. Babies who require Mommy or
Daddy to fall asleep develop a bad habit that's hard to break and
is hard on everyone.
</P>
<P>
   What to do?
</P>
<P>
   University of Notre Dame anthropologist James McKenna has a
suggestion: Chill out.
</P>
<P>
   Children's temperaments are as individual as the dreams they
dream, he said in a recent interview. What's ideal for one child
may not be for another. What works today may not work tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake. McKenna, who will discuss his 18 years of
research on mother//baby sleep patterns in November at the annual
meeting of the American Anthropological Association in Chicago, is
a strong proponent of what's known as co-sleeping, bed-sharing or
the family bed.
</P>
<P>
   In his studies, he has videotaped and physiologically monitored
more than 110 pairs of breast-feeding mothers and their babies,
ages 2 months to 5 months old. That age often is associated with
SIDS, or sudden infant death syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Among his findings: Co-sleeping babies generally are placed in
safer positions; babies position themselves to look at their
mothers through 90 percent of the night; co-sleeping babies
breast-feed more; babies cry less and sleep more even though they
stir more and spend less time in the kind of deep sleep most
associated with SIDS.
</P>
<P>
   McKenna also supports co-sleeping for older babies and toddlers.
Mother and child co-sleeping is standard in the vast majority of
non-Western cultures, he says. And it's more common in the United
States than most people imagine or admit.
</P>
<P>
   One 1988 study examining sleep patterns in New York and
Cleveland showed that 19 percent of white, 59 percent of black and
26 percent of Hispanic parents allowed babies or toddlers to sleep
with them all night or part of the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Western cultures have allowed technology to be
substituted for mother and baby contact, biology is the same as it
was 10,000 years ago,'' McKenna said. ``Babies still need that
contact and comfort.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also recognizes that when it comes to babies and family
sleeping arrangements, ``there are very few purists.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents try about everything,'' McKenna said. ``Rarely is
there just one kind of sleeping arrangement that works for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Whereas some babies sleep in their cribs all night, others sleep
in their parents' bed. Whereas some fall asleep in their cribs and
wake in the bed, others start in bed and wake in the crib. As
children grow, preferences change. They go through phases.
</P>
<P>
   McKenna's goal, he said, isn't to convince all parents to bring
their young children into bed with them. Some parents find it's
just too hard to get a good night's sleep.
</P>
<P>
   But he does want them to not feel guilty or think they're
harming their child if they allow co-sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of scare tactics about what happens when
children sleep with their parents,'' McKenna said. ``They are not
based on science.''
</P>
<P>
   In his best-selling 1985 book, Solve Your Child's Sleep
Problems, physician Richard Ferber, director of the Center for
Pediatric Sleep Disorders at Boston's Children's Hospital, writes:
</P>
<P>
   ``Although taking your child into bed with you for a night or
two may be reasonable if he is ill or very upset about something,
for the most part this is not a good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferber provides a list of reasons. It disturbs everyone's sleep,
he says. It may cause problems when parents want to leave the child
with a baby sitter, thus interfering with their social lives. But
his chief argument against co-sleeping is this:
</P>
<P>
   ``Sleeping alone is an important part of his learning to be able
to separate from you without anxiety and to see himself as an
independent individual. This process is important to this early
psychological development. In addition, sleeping in your bed can
make your child feel confused and anxious rather than relaxed and
reassured. Even a young toddler may find this repeated experience
overly stimulating. If you allow him to crawl in between you and
your spouse, in a sense separating the two of you, he may feel too
powerful and become worried. He wants the reassurance of knowing
that you are in control and that you will do what is best for him
regardless of his demands. If you show you cannot do this and let
him act out his impulses, he may become frightened.''
</P>
<P>
   If, for instance, one partner is away for the night and a child
is allowed in the bed, Ferber writes, a child may feel more fearful
because he may think he is replacing one of the parents and may
cause them to separate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ever do, he may feel responsible,'' Ferber writes.
</P>
<P>
   But McKenna thinks this is bunk based on opinion and conjecture,
not science. Indeed, no studies show that children who co-sleep
turn out to be any less independent than those who sleep on their
own. In his ongoing studies of Notre Dame students _ those raised
in co-sleeping homes and those not _ McKenna has found nothing to
support a lack of independence or later sleep difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The studies that are coming out now are showing just the
opposite,'' he said. ``Babies who sleep routinely with their
parents have fewer tantrums during the day, handle stress better
than solitary sleeping babies and, on average, get average or
higher reports from teachers and parents on their behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Other experts have weighed in on the subject:
</P>
<P>
   - Ed Christophersen, a professor of pediatrics and an expert in
child behavior at Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, has a
mixed view. He thinks it is important for infants to learn to
soothe themselves to sleep. If he has any problem with bed-sharing,
it is that too many parents rely on it to get their children to
sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I see all the time is parents with no intention of having
a family bed,'' he said. ``They just don't know what else to do
because they can't get the kid to go to bed. They are not thinking
of the best interest of the child; they are trying to minimize
conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Ferber, Christophersen thinks the practice doesn't do kids
any favors. He thinks a child's inability to calm himself may cause
difficulties later on. ``The way kids learn self-calming skills,''
he said, ``is by being given the opportunity to calm themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   But overall, ``If you want to have a family bed, I don't think
it is unreasonable,'' he said. ``Anything that people will tell you
are the benefits of a family bed, I'm buying.''
</P>
<P>
   - Chicago physician Marc Weissbluth, author of Healthy Sleep
Habits, Happy Child, said: ``The family bed is not good or bad. It
is a family decision in the same way bathing together or not is a
family decision. Just as family bathing has nothing to do with
cleanliness, the family bed in and of itself has nothing to do with
sleep quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's important is the sleep quality of the child. The sleep
quality of the child is independent of whether the child is
sleeping with the parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Some parents, of course, may not like it. Partners may find it
interferes with their intimacy. Weissbluth understands and thinks
the family bed could become a pain if a child can't sleep unless
one or both parents are in bed.
</P>
<P>
   But, again, Weissbluth thinks these are family choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no problem,'' Weissbluth said, ``as long as both
parents want to sleep with their children and their children's
natural sleep schedules are respected. Families have to decide
what's best for their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many cultures, the family bed is the norm. And these
children have no problems.''

GOOSENECK LAMPS PROVIDE FLEXIBLE LIGHTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM HEINS  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The most common light for home tasks or reading
is the gooseneck lamp, named for its flexible neck.
</P>
<P>
   These lamps have been around since the Victorian era and were
also popular in contemporary rooms of the 1950s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Because they are so handy, they can be used in any room in the
house, from a home office to a nightstand. They are most commonly
used next to a favorite reading chair and have been a dorm room or
bedroom staple for students.
</P>
<P>
   If table space is scarce, look to a gooseneck floor lamp, but
even the tabletop varieties take up very little space.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gooseneck lamps can be streamlined to fit just about any
decor,'' said Denise Maurer, an interior designer in Troy. ``It's a
very utilitarian device.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Trawinski, branch manager of Wolberg Electric in
Schenectady, said the desk lamps cost $15 and up, and gooseneck
floor lamp prices start at $75.
</P>
<P>
   They can come with three-way bulbs and dimmers, and in a variety
of colors. ``You used to only be able to get them in a chrome
finish, but now you can find them in black, white, ivory, red and
brass,'' Trawinski said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of fire safety issues, take care not to place the lamp,
especially one with a halogen bulb, too close to objects.

IN THIS NONSEASON, LEMONADE DAYS GIVE WAY TO CIDER NIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST DOVER, Vt. _ The leaves are green still and give mere hints
of fading, but people have been heating with wood for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of September, the morning chill pulls away fast in
southern Vermont and the sun takes over for most of the day,
creating a strong imitation of July. By late afternoon, though, the
sun has dipped below the peaks here, and the autumn part of the day
begins.
</P>
<P>
   Cold air seems to arrive instantly. White birches turn ashen,
blackening pines close in and I wonder whether I will ever see the
bears that my neighbors keep talking about before they _ the bears,
that is _ retreat for the winter. The lawn-mower drone of a few
weeks ago has been replaced by a chain-saw rip _ someone rushing to
finish a house construction maybe, or cutting wood for sale.
</P>
<P>
   On the way here, I had stopped for firewood, being carefully
vague with my order.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, I did not say anything about a ``cord,'' the only
unit of measurement I have heard of, or small logs would have
filled the front porch and living room of my new house. I got by
with ``a few arm loads'' for $10 and wondered what part of a cord
that amounted to so I could request it next time.
</P>
<P>
   Heading north on a favorite stretch of Route 100 outside
Wilmington, where the road swirls ahead like a paint brush
displaying the pastures and mountains to come, I was tempted to
stop at one of the stands advertising ``Maple Syrup'' in red paint.
But I know I'd never use the stuff. The onset of fall just makes
you want to stock up on things before they are gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most beautiful time of year but it's sad,'' said Paul
DiBenedetto, who sees cars rush past year-round from Left Bank
Antiques, the well-appointed shop at the four corners in
Wilmington. ``Summer's gone and now you think about the year gone
by. You didn't climb any mountains, you didn't fly a plane, you
didn't fly a parachute, not that I intended to, but ...''
</P>
<P>
   The sign on Route 9 welcomes visitors who have driven into the
mountains, coming from Bennington to the Mount Snow-Haystack
Region, ``a four-season resort.'' But this time of year would not
be included in any seasonal category and it's my favorite of the
nonseasons, a mellow cider to July's lemonade.
</P>
<P>
   DiBenedetto says we're into one of three or four brief lulls of
the year, but it seems to me the area is showing a bit more spirit
than it did a month ago, when the ground was parched and older
Floridians, frankly, were starting to look bored here in southern
Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   The Deerfield River, nearly barren until recently, is spritzing
through its rocky beds, and yellowed cow fields are suddenly
verdant thanks to rain. The trees themselves, showing an occasional
spike of orange, are greener than during the height of summer, when
they looked burned. Proprietors seem to be working on their ski
shops, yet there are many weeks left to hike and bike.
</P>
<P>
   Already, traffic gets clogged by traveling homes called ``Four
Winds'' or ``Coachman,'' and I can't be sure whether the explorers
driving them are getting a jump on leaf-peeping or getting out
before the frost.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Left Bank Antiques, a British couple on a bus tour asks
directions to a grocery. I ask where they're going and they tell me
``back to Vermont.''
</P>
<P>
   For decades, I had come here for ski weekends, rushing to and
from the area I always considered the New York part of Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, fate delivered me an actual residence, my first chance
to join other urban types who play country part time. All summer I
had been filling the house to make it livable and leaving again.
</P>
<P>
   During nearly weekly, neurotic trips to the Home Depot across
the state line, in Albany, N.Y., I'd wonder what I'd do if the
Vermont place was ever completed, and this always scared me. That
time has come this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Now, driving to the house, I pass Hayseed Gifts, the Pampered
Palate and shops selling plastic Canada geese and imagine that I
won't be spending much time at these places. But it's difficult to
imagine where I may actually land in the pecking order of tourists
and the people who wait on them.
</P>
<P>
   I've never be an insider here, where to qualify you'd have to be
native. And, I've been warned, the locals have labels for just
about everyone else. Would I be a ``weekender,'' a ``flatlander,''
or, God forbid, a ``conehead,'' a term of derision that either tars
people from Connecticut or people who wear pointy ski hats. Either
way, I'm nailed.
</P>
<P>
   With very little exploring, it's clear that the area's far more
rural than I'd have imagined during college forays to the ski
slopes and condos. Though situated squarely in a metropolitan
Boston and New York City resort, my little house is on the cusps of
the great Green Mountain National Forest, where the Long Trail and
the Appalachian Trail were conceived and mapped out.
</P>
<P>
   The trails and seasonal dirt roads are as rural and sometimes
barely passable as you'd expect to encounter in the Rockies, and
packed with through-hikers with stories of their elaborate treks.
The last time I hiked here, one of the only times so far, the air
was summery on the bottom, but the winds at the top of Stratton
Mountain blew in with such force and chill that snow felt like the
next step.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby my house this time of year, the mostly empty homes,
California geometric and New England salt box-inspired, are great
monuments to their part-time occupants. Firewood has been delivered
and stacked tight outside some and ``for rent'' signs have gone up
on others, a select few offering seductive views of Mount Snow's
North face.
</P>
<P>
   But at the end of a string of vacant homes on Lower Handle Road,
there's a year-round neighbor who introduces me to her chickens,
her horse, her dogs, her kittens, her tractor and her husband. She
insists on giving me a dozen just-laid brown eggs. All summer I'd
never known her spread was there. As Paul DiBenedetto said, you
tend to notice more this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you hear the crows gathering. I can hear them in the
early morning, I guess, preparing to leave,'' he had noted. ``And
it won't be long flocks of geese are filling the sky.''

ANTI-WAR RADICAL FINDS SOLITUDE 29 YEARS AFTER DEADLY HEIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDWARD FITZPATRICK  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Susan Saxe _ the quiet kid who penned her high
school class poem in 1966 _ entered a Boston bank on Sept. 23,
1970, wearing a purple dress, carrying a .30-caliber carbine.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Saxe and her accomplices made their getaway in a
1967 Volkswagen, a Boston policeman was lying outside the State
Street Bank &AMP; Trust Co., dying.
</P>
<P>
   Saxe hadn't pulled the trigger. She was one of five
conspirators, a collection of college students and ex-cons. It was
a 41-year-old parolee, William ``Lefty'' Gilday Jr., who fired the
fatal shot, hitting Patrolman Walter Schroeder Sr. as he responded
to the bank alarm.
</P>
<P>
   But soon Saxe, who had made the dean's list at Brandeis
University in Waltham, Mass., was on the FBI's Top 10 Most Wanted
list. And soon the question, in various forms, was asked: How could
this be? How could this bookish, bespectacled poet end up a
militant activist, ready to pick up a rifle in the name of
revolution? How could she take part in an act of such tragic
consequence: a 42-year-old father of nine, with a .45-caliber
bullet in the back?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, if there is one, lies in the turbulent times, in the
Vietnam War that outraged so many, in the student protests and
brutal police responses, and in the unlikely alliances forged at
Brandeis, then center of a nationwide student strike.
</P>
<P>
   To Saxe's parents, the initial reports about the Boston heist
seemed utterly impossible. At their Albany home, they had raised a
model daughter _ a top student at Albany High School, a member of
the Theta Alpha Literary Society, the winner of an Albany Poetry
Society contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember a year of lights and music ...'' her class poem read.
``Gilded moments/ Climaxed by a Senior Ball/ A towering fantasy/ A
last good-bye.''
</P>
<P>
   Saxe went to Syracuse University on a Regents scholarship,
majoring in journalism. ``Susan wouldn't hurt a fly,'' a roommate
recalled. ``She was not a political activist.''
</P>
<P>
   When Syracuse proved too easy for her, Saxe transferred to
Brandeis, graduating magna cum laude in 1970 with an English
degree. She was 21 years old.
</P>
<P>
   After graduation, she told people she wanted to go the
University of Oregon to get a master's degree and teach. The
university withdrew its offer, she said, but she was going there
anyway to work in a bookstore and pursue writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Susan's been living in Portland, Oregon, since Sept. 1,'' her
father, Eliot Saxe, said as news of the Boston holdup broke. ``She
went out there for peace and quiet,'' said her mother, Rose Saxe.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, their daughter's life was on the brink of revolution _
and robbery.
</P>
<P>
   A transformation had begun at Brandeis. Saxe went to campus as
student opposition to the Vietnam War ratcheted to new heights,
interlocking with civil rights, women's liberation and other
causes.
</P>
<P>
   On April 30, 1970, President Richard Nixon announced the
invasion of Cambodia. After five years of war, many activists were
worn out, but the invasion, following Nixon's promise not to
escalate the fighting, stoked student furor. Four days later, the
Ohio National Guard fired at student protesters at Kent State
University, killing four.
</P>
<P>
   Strikes spread to 60 college campuses, and Brandeis students
opened the National Student Strike Information Center, with Saxe
among the workers. Saxe also became active in the campus women's
liberation movement. She began to make friends with those who
shared that passion, including Katherine Ann Power of Denver, an
outspoken campus politician and women's activist.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Power said she crossed the line in the spring of 1970,
going from nonviolent protest to clandestine action. She saw
sit-ins and marches as pitiful responses to the war.
</P>
<P>
   Power became involved with Stanley Bond, a Vietnam helicopter
pilot who committed 20 armed robberies after his return home. Bond
was attending Brandeis under the Student Tutor Education Program.
Bond had shared a prison cell with William Gilday Jr., who also
entered the STEP rehabilitation program, planning to attend
Boston's Northeastern University along with ex-con Robert Valeri.
Gilday and Valeri also had been imprisoned on robbery charges.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the two students and three ex-cons found common
purpose: revolution. They planned to amass weapons and cash.
</P>
<P>
   Their first strike came Sept. 1, 1970, in Philadelphia. Armed
with a Molotov cocktail, Saxe waited outside the Bell Savings &AMP;
Loan, while Bond entered the office and Power waited at the wheel
of a getaway car. They made off with $6,240.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE ... MORE)
</P>
<P>
   By Sept. 15, Saxe was in Portland buying four carbines, an
automatic pistol, a .38 special, plus ammunition. By Sept. 20,
Saxe, Power and the three parolees were back together in
Massachusetts, breaking into the National Guard Armory in
Newburyport, taking 400 rounds of .30-caliber ammunition and
plunger-type dynamite machines.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the Sept. 23 bank heist, which netted $26,000.
Afterward, Saxe was upset with Gilday, calling him trigger-happy.
Gilday said the cops had arrived within 30 seconds and the group
would have been caught if he hadn't fired from his lookout post
across the street.
</P>
<P>
   The police nabbed Valeri within 12 hours and Bond and Gilday
within the month. Power wasn't caught until 1993. Under an alias,
she married, had a son, and became a gourmet chef in Oregon. But
the burden of her secret led to depression, prompting her to
surrender.
</P>
<P>
   Saxe eluded capture until March 27, 1975, when a Philadelphia
cop spotted her on the street, recognizing her from an FBI photo.
</P>
<P>
   After a mistrial, Saxe pleaded guilty in 1977 to armed robbery
and a reduced charge of manslaughter, receiving a sentence of
12-to-14 years in Massachusetts state prison. She earned ``good
time'' and was released in 1982 after serving about seven years.
</P>
<P>
   In prison, Saxe tutored, set up a playroom for mothers and their
children, and became active in prison reform. ``You can still be a
revolutionary and not be armed,'' she said in a 1980 interview.
``If I give people here hope, then yes, I'm changing things.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Saxe, 50, is chief operating officer for the Alliance for
Jewish Renewal, a nonprofit group in Philadelphia that blends
spirituality and social action. It publishes the quarterly journal
New Menorah, sponsors a retreat center and coordinates a rabbi
ordination program.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is motivated to help people on the margins _ she is
concerned with the have-nots,'' said Rabbi Shaya Isenberg, the
Alliance board chairman. ``She has a very broad and deep grasp of
people and social systems, and a devotion to Judaism into the next
millennium _ that it be open and oriented to social justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Saxe's past doesn't hamper her on the job, Isenberg said.
``People knew her past, and everyone was very excited she was being
hired.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Isenberg said Saxe and her partner, a woman named Moon Smith,
are raising three children.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a reporter visited the Alliance offices. On the third
floor, at the top of the stairs, stood a short woman with gray hair
and glasses, wearing a purple shirt: Susan Saxe.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' she said when the reporter identified himself. ``I don't
want to talk to you.'' She turned, fled down the hall and slammed
her office door shut.
</P>
<P>
   So 29 years after that chaotic year and that defining day, what
is the world to make of the poet radical from Albany? Andor Skotnes
_ an associate professor of history at Russell Sage College in
Troy, said people such as Saxe should be supported.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people who went further than they thought they should
in the 1960s have found ways to continue progressive courses for
greater democracy and human rights,'' said Skotnes, a member of
Students for a Democratic Society in the 1960s. ``The desperation
and imperative of the times made people take extreme actions that
seem impossible today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know times were different,'' Edmund McNamara, who was Boston
police commissioner when Schroeder was shot, said when Power turned
herself in. ``There were protests and everything. Sure, the country
was coming apart, but what the hell did Walter have to do with
bombing Hanoi? He was just doing his job that day.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached in Sarasota, Fla., Saxe's mother, Rose, said, ``She paid
her price to society. When someone pays her price and then lives a
good life, you should leave it alone. People who love and care
about her know she's turned around and is living a good life.''

GEORGE CLOONEY GOES FOR THE GOLD ON THE SILVER SCREEN 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 (Includes a color slide of George Clooney with Ice Cube and Mark
Wahlberg in a scene from ``Three Kings.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    George Clooney thinks he's a good actor. Sometimes, anyway.
 &HT;    ``Sometimes I am good,'' he explains. ``If I've got a good
script, I can do a good job. A good character can survive a lot of
things. There are things I've done that I like and things I've done
where I go, `Wow, I just missed that completely.'''
 &HT;    Among the latter, the one that he remembers most is ``Batman and
Robin'' (1997).
 &HT;    ``I whiffed,'' Clooney says matter-of-factly. ``I don't take
full heat for that personally. I do publicly. I go, `Hey, it
bombed. I'll take the heat.' I don't know what I could have done _
I saw part of it the other day on cable, and cringed through it.
 &HT;    ``It's a tough one,'' he says, ``because the script wasn't there
at all. For whatever reasons, I didn't get it, either _ I didn't
mesh with it.''
 &HT;    Clooney, the handsome and charismatic former star of
television's ``ER,'' has yet to score big on the big screen. Early
in his career he turned up in the likes of ``Return of the Killer
Tomatoes'' (1988), but since ``ER'' he's appeared in a number of
potential star-makers, including ``One Fine Day'' (1996), ``Batman
and Robin,'' ``The Peacemaker'' (1997) and ``Out of Sight'' (1998).
 &HT;    The actor earned kudos for ``One Fine Day'' and raves for ``Out
of Sight,'' but none of his films made much of a splash at the box
office. Clooney tries again on Oct. 1 with ``Three Kings,'' an
ambitious mix of black comedy, action and drama set amid the chaos
of the Gulf War.
 &HT;    Written and directed by David O. Russell, ``Three Kings'' plops
audiences into 1991 Iraq, where American ground troops sit idly
while jets handle the real fighting. Among the soldiers are
Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube and Spike Jonze _ all of whom,
upon hearing of a cease-fire agreement, can't wait to get home.
 &HT;    When the four discover a map revealing the site of Saddam
Hussein's secret stash of gold bullion, they go AWOL in an attempt
to get rich quick. However, their efforts to grab the gold bring
them face-to-face with the Iraqi people, forcing each man to
grapple with issues of morality and mortality.
 &HT;    Clooney loved the ``Three Kings'' script, but there were several
obstacles to his making the film _ most notably Mel Gibson and
Nicolas Cage.
 &HT;    ``I'm on a list and I'm down on that list, so you have to get
through those other guys,'' Clooney says, charming and honest as
usual during a conversation at New York's Essex House. ``I had to
take Mel, tie him up and keep him in my house.
 &HT;    ``They wanted Nic pretty badly for this, too,'' he adds. ``He
was really interested, but he had commitments to other films, thank
God.
 &HT;    ``I just kept lobbying,'' Clooney says with a laugh. ``I sent
David a letter. I followed him _ to this hotel, actually. I showed
up and said, `Come on, don't be a jerk. Give me the job.'
 &HT;    ``And I eventually got the job.''
 &HT;    As things finally worked out, ``Three Kings'' is a dizzying,
complex achievement, at once entertaining, funny, pointed,
thought-provoking and smart. In other words, it's everything that
``Wild Wild West'' (1999) was not _ which is just as well for
Clooney, who wisely pulled out of that project.
 &HT;    But if ``Wild Wild West'' proved too dumb for many audience's
taste, ``Three Kings'' might be too smart for its own good.
 &HT;    Clooney winces at the possibility _ much the same thing happened
to the engaging-but-little-seen ``Out of Sight'' _ but insists that
audiences will be able to handle ``Three Kings.''
 &HT;    ``When they screened `ER' for NBC,'' Clooney recalls, ``Don
Ohlmeyer and Warren Littlefield looked over at Les Moonves, who was
the head of Warner Bros. at the time, and said, `What the hell did
you do with our $3 million? No one will follow this show. There are
too many story lines _ the audience can't keep up.'
 &HT;    ``We tested it,'' he adds, ``and it tested through the roof.
They accused us of doctoring the testing, and went and brought in a
`Jay Leno' audience to prove us wrong. And it tested through the
roof, and was arguably one of the biggest hits of all time.''
 &HT;    Hollywood errs in assuming that moviegoers want only bland,
easily digested fare, Clooney believes.
 &HT;    ``I think we always underestimate the audience,'' he says. ``If
you play to dumb, you'll get dumb movies out there and people
saying `This is dumb.'
 &HT;    ``A lot of really good movies get made,'' the actor adds, ``and
people see them. I don't think we have to bring the bar down.''
 &HT;    Though Clooney still considers himself an actor for hire _ he
just wrapped the Coen Brothers' ``O Brother, Where Art Thou?'' and
is currently shooting ``The Perfect Storm,'' again co-starring
Wahlberg _ he's also attempting to take matters into his own hands
by producing films through his company, Maysville Pictures.
Maysville, he proudly reports, already has 35 scripts in various
stages of development at the major studios.
 &HT;    ``I can read a script and know whether or not I like it,'' he
says. ``Whether I'm right or not, time will tell.''
 &HT;    Time will tell, too, whether Clooney reprises his breakthrough
role as Dr. Doug Ross on ``ER.'' Recent tabloid stories blared that
producer John Wells would be bringing Clooney back for several
episodes _ including the finale for departing series veteran
Julianna Margulies _ at a staggering $2 million a pop.
 &HT;    ``I have only been asked once,'' Clooney says, ``and I was asked
a general question by John Wells. The question was, `Are you open
to the idea of coming back and getting Julianna off the show at the
end of the season?'
 &HT;    ``That's the only time we've talked,'' he says firmly, ``and
that's the only question that's been posed. All the other things
were completely made up.''
 &HT;    So what about that one question, then?
 &HT;    ``My answer to John was that anything that he could come up with
that would have to do with Julianna, I'd be happy to do,'' Clooney
says. ``These guys are really good friends _ not just the actors,
but the producers.''
 &HT;    That practical, down-to-earth thinking is typical of Clooney. It
might be smoke and mirrors _ after all, he's a good actor, right? _
but he exhibits a realistic sense of self, a drive to succeed and,
thankfully, an in-check ego.
 &HT;    ``Fifteen years from now I could be hit by a bus,'' he says
thoughtfully. ``I could be back on television.
 &HT;    ``People go, `So you're done with television for good?' You go
`Yeah,''' he says with a shrug. ``Everybody says, `For good,' but
there are plenty of people out there who are right back on
television series. Hopefully I won't have to rely just on people's
opinions of me.
 &HT;    ``That's why you have a production company, so you can do other
things,'' Clooney says. ``People get tired of seeing you. So I'll
have to have other jobs to fall back on.''

 (Includes a color slide of Rob Reiner with Bruce Willis in a scene
from ``The Story of Us.'') 
 By JEANNE WOLF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It's been a decade since actor/director Rob Reiner explored
romance and relationships in his hit comedy, ``When Harry Met
Sally'' (1989).
 &HT;    His new film, ``The Story of Us,'' takes that exploration one
long step further. Opening Oct. 15, it's the story of a husband and
wife (Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer) on the verge of divorce
after 15 years of marriage and two children.
 &HT;    Think of it as ``When Harry Got a Trial Separation From Sally.''
And, oh yeah, it's a comedy.
 &HT;    Reiner _ who directs and also plays Willis' best friend,
co-starring with Rita Wilson and Paul Reiser _ feels he's breaking
some new ground this time out.
 &HT;    ``There are a lot of movies about people falling in love and
people getting divorced,'' he says, ``but there aren't many that
deal with everything in-between _ the day-to-day wear and tear, the
ins and outs of a marriage.''
 &HT;    Writers Alan Zweibel and Jessie Nelson shared Reiner's
fascination with the subject, and the trio _ all married and with
children _ embarked upon a script-writing process which, Reiner
freely admits, drew heavily on their own experiences with ``til
death do us part.''
 &HT;    ``That's the only way you can create a film like this,'' the
director says. ``You only know what happens in your own marriage,
and you hope that other people will relate to what you've gone
through. It can be painful and uncomfortable to share those
details, but how else can you do it?
 &HT;    ``I think we hit on some basic truths that an audience is going
to identify with.''
 &HT;    Reiner was surprised to discover that his stars were quite a bit
like the characters they play _ Willis a not-very-practical writer
and Pfeiffer a hyperorganized control freak, two opposites who
originally attract and then start driving each other crazy.
 &HT;    ``Michelle is the earth mother of her own family, the designated
driver who likes to control everything,'' the director says.
``Bruce, on the other hand, doesn't color inside the lines. He's
all over the place.''
 &HT;    Ironically, while the actors were playing out a marriage on the
rocks in front of the cameras, both were facing similar emotional
challenges offscreen. Willis was engulfed in a tabloid frenzy over
his highly publicized separation from his wife, actress Demi Moore,
while Pfeiffer was coping with the death of her father.
 &HT;    ``It was tough on Bruce to be in the throes of a very difficult
breakup,'' Reiner says. ``We had some private conversations about
it, because he was really struggling with it.
 &HT;    ``You know, they talk about method acting, where you draw on
past experiences to get the right emotion for a scene,'' he adds.
``I think Bruce didn't have to look very far _ it was so fresh from
his life that he brought it right into the film ... I think it
ultimately helped his performance.''
 &HT;    He adds that the turmoil of a breakup is especially hard for a
celebrity on Willis' level.
 &HT;    ``You can hide a lot of the pain if you're an ordinary person,''
Reiner says. ``But you feel like you're sharing the most intimate
details of your life with strangers when the media puts you under a
microscope like he has been.''
 &HT;    Pfeiffer remains happily married to Emmy-winning producer/writer
David E. Kelley, but the death of her father took its toll.
 &HT;    ``It was a terrible loss for her,'' Reiner says. ``She was
struggling with her own demons. Even so, I think that she could use
some of it in her performance, as Bruce did.
 &HT;    ``It was tough for both of them, but they were unbelievably
professional.''
 &HT;    It's hard to believe that ``The Story of Us'' could be funny,
but Reiner insists that the angst and the laughs are carefully
balanced.
 &HT;    ``I think it's realistic,'' he says. ``Marriage is uncomfortable
and difficult, and it's also joyous and uplifting. But the biggest
challenge is to play something that's funny and real at the same
time _ to move people and make them laugh at the same time is the
hardest thing in the world.
 &HT;    ``Bruce and Michelle both have that gift. It's rare.''
 &HT;    Personally, he adds, he found the love scenes the most difficult
to direct.
 &HT;    ``I'm completely embarrassed by those scenes,'' Reiner admits,
``and I wish there was somebody else behind the camera when they do
them.
 &HT;    ``The easiest for me was the scene where they make love on the
kitchen butcher block,'' he says, ``because we played it for
laughs. But there's a moment in the montage at the end of the film
that's pretty much raw sex. That was uncomfortable.
 &HT;    ``But Michelle and Bruce were great,'' he adds, ``and I think
they were a lot less embarrassed than I was.''
 &HT;    Reiner, who many years ago went through his own much-publicized
divorce, from actress-turned-director Penny Marshall, is in a
long-running second marriage to photographer Michele Singer.
 &HT;    ``Since I put some of our own relationship into the film, it was
interesting to sit next to my wife at a screening,'' he says,
laughing. ``I remember the scene where there's this thing about not
replacing the toilet paper when the roll runs out. Michele looked
over at me and shook her head, because she's been on my case about
that kind of stuff.''
 &HT;    The director thinks he's a better husband the second time
around, in part because of his first marriage and even the divorce
that followed.
 &HT;    ``I went through some therapy after I got divorced, which gave
me a better understanding of what I'm bringing to a relationship
and what I can expect from my partner,'' he says. ``Understanding
is realizing that you are probably 50 percent of any problem. You
may not be able to change the other person, but at least you can
work on yourself and your own behavior.''
 &HT;    Reiner, a devoted father of three, readily admits that the
typical marriage's biggest hurdle is children.
 &HT;    ``I think Rita Wilson said on the set one day, `Kids are the
Jack Kevorkian of romance,''' he says with a laugh. ``We all know
what that means _ diaper changes, car-pool pickups ... Who's
picking them up from school? Who's taking them here or there?
 &HT;    ``It doesn't leave very much time for romance.''
 &HT;    He has a little secret to keep romance alive in his own home, he
adds.
 &HT;    ``You have to make dates,'' Reiner says with a chuckle. ``Like
you make a date to go out on Friday night. Otherwise you just get
lost in the day-to-day demands of family life, and you find
yourself disengaging like the couple in the film.''
 &HT;    He stops in thought.
 &HT;    ``What's the secret to a good marriage?'' he asks rhetorically.
``I guess you've got to be good friends. You've got to connect on a
lot of levels, and you really have to work to have a great
understanding of each other.
 &HT;    ``If you can do that, then you can weather any storm.''

 (Includes a color slide of Molly Shannon in a scene from
``Superstar.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    A hospital waiting room doesn't seem like the place to get your
start in stand-up comedy, but 4-year-old Molly Shannon didn't
choose it.
 &HT;    That choice was made by the driver who killed her mother.
 &HT;    It was raining that day, Shannon recalls _ nearly three decades
later, she remembers the details as if it were only yesterday.
 &HT;    Her father pulled out of a Fourth of July picnic in a car filled
with laughing females _ his wife, their daughters Molly and Mary,
and a niece. He never even saw the speeding car that veered from
the oncoming lane and skidded in their direction.
 &HT;    ``It was just a real bad wipeout,'' Shannon recalls. ``My mother
and my cousin died in front of me.''
 &HT;    Molly, the smallest girl in the car, was the least injured.
While doctors worked over her father and sister, a nurse dumped the
frightened, confused preschooler in the hospital waiting room.
 &HT;    ``I spent my time there trying to make the other kids laugh,
figuring that they had it worse than me,'' she recalls. ``It's
strange what you remember, but I think that's where comedy started
for me.
 &HT;    ``I come from a sad place, and the only way I could make peace
with it was by making others laugh.''
 &HT;    Shannon has kept on making people laugh _ at 33, she's a
``Saturday Night Live'' regular best known for her recurring
character Mary Katherine Gallagher, an overweight, awkward Catholic
schoolgirl who, on Oct. 8, will become the heroine of her own
movie, ``Superstar.''
 &HT;    Over coffee in her suite at Los Angeles' Four Seasons hotel,
Shannon doesn't look much like Mary Katherine. Thin and stylish in
a red sweater and black pants, she readily admits that Mary
Katherine and her dreams of superstardom grew out of Shannon's own
tragic childhood.
 &HT;    ``Almost every time you meet a funny person, they've probably
done a lot of crying on the inside,'' she says. ``It's not just a
saying _ it's true.
 &HT;    ``My dream was to feel happy.''
 &HT;    Shannon is currently riding a hot streak _ besides
``Superstar,'' she also has a role in Ron Howard's upcoming
adaptation of the Dr. Seuss classic, ``The Grinch Who Stole
Christmas.'' But she remembers all too well the way things used to
be.
 &HT;    ``My character Mary Katherine loses her parents when the film
begins,'' Shannon says. ``She feels like such a loser _ she feels
like nothing. She also feels like she's waiting for something to
erase the hurt. In her case, it's stardom.
 &HT;    ``I understand her,'' the comedian says. ``I know of her drive
to get to a place where you won't feel like nothing.''
 &HT;    For herself, Shannon adds, she's found that place.
 &HT;    ``I've made peace with my past,'' she says quietly. ``In fact,
the only thing that really depresses me now is that I don't have a
date for the millennium _ but the year is still young.''
 &HT;    Growing up in Cleveland, she recalls, her active fantasy life
laid the groundwork for her career as a performer. Isolated from
those around her _ her father's legs were crushed in the accident,
so for a long time Shannon and her sister were deprived of both
parents _ she turned inward for support.
 &HT;    ``I remember I had a piano teacher who wore a big, flowing
blouse and doused on the perfume,'' she says. ``I'd sit next to her
and she'd be like, `La, la, la-de-da _ play those notes.' But I
wasn't paying attention because her blouse would touch me and I'd
think of my mom.
 &HT;    ``But then I'd actually move away,'' she adds. ``I didn't want
to get too close.''
 &HT;    Distrustful of the outside world, she retreated into a realm of
her own.
 &HT;    ``At home, I went into a fantasy world which was all about me
playing and inventing characters,'' Shannon says. ``It was an
escape hatch into a place where there was nothing wrong. It was
acting.''
 &HT;    Simultaneously, she was unknowingly accumulating material for
Mary Katherine's future routines.
 &HT;    ``On top of my tragic childhood, I had to go to Catholic
school,'' Shannon says, laughing.
 &HT;    ``On the serious side, all that pressure at school to be a good
girl keeps you from getting angry about stuff,'' she adds. ``And I
think it's good to get angry about stuff.
 &HT;    ``At night I'd go to parties and make out and drink,'' she
recalls. ``But if a boy wanted to get serious, I'd be like, `No
way.' If somebody wanted to get too close, I was like, `I'm out of
here.' I dumped them.
 &HT;    ``Fear of intimacy,'' she says with a shrug. ``And I'm still
working on it.''
 &HT;    Shannon even once considered becoming a nun.
 &HT;    ``I did want to become a nun,'' she admits, laughing. ``In fact,
I pretended I was a nun all the time. But the problem is that I
wanted to be a sexy nun, which didn't go over big at school.''
 &HT;    Even now, after she's achieved success with ``Saturday Night
Live'' and laid some of her ghosts to rest, Shannon spends a lot of
time alone.
 &HT;    ``I don't like to go out much,'' she says. ``I honestly think it
makes you a different kind of woman when you're raised by a man. I
always saw things from a man's point of view _ I became very
work-oriented.
 &HT;    ``In fact, I had to find the womanly part of myself recently,''
she adds. ``I had to sort of discover that you can work and have
that other part of yourself.''
 &HT;    As for affairs of the heart, Shannon says with a roll of her
eyes that there's nothing much going on at the moment. In fact, she
says, her romantic life peaked at age 6.
 &HT;    ``I used to go into the bushes with Tommy Sullivan and smooch
with him,'' she says cheerfully. ``It was really nice. We just
kissed and kissed. And it was actually a very healthy relationship.
 &HT;    ``Love went downhill from there.''
 &HT;    Like Mary Katherine, however, Shannon never gives up hope.
 &HT;    ``I hope that I'm in a healthy relationship by the millennium,''
she says, ``because that's important. I want to be enjoying my life
a little bit more.''

INSIDE `PROVIDENCE': MELINA KANAKAREDES ADJUSTS TO LIFE AS A STAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 (Includes a color slide of Melina Kanakaredes with Paula Cale, Mike
Farrell and Seth Peterson in a scene from ``Providence.'') 
 By MICHAEL LOGAN  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Melina Kanakaredes is either supremely self-confident or
thoroughly lacking in ego. Or perhaps both.
</P>
<P>
   The leading lady of the red-hot NBC drama ``Providence'' is
conducting an early-morning interview in her trailer near the set,
but because she has not yet reported to the hair-and-makeup
department, her famous curls have not been coiffed and her face is
without even a touch of cosmetics.
</P>
<P>
   For an actress to appear this way in front of a reporter is a
virtually unprecedented act of daring. But she needn't fret _ even
sans artificial enhancement, she is an incandescent beauty.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, she is the perfect hostess.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make these really incredible, really strong, iced Greek
coffees. Would you like one?'' Kanakaredes says, sprinting to the
trailer's mini-kitchen. ``I'm surviving on sugar and caffeine these
days.''
</P>
<P>
   As the actress whips up her concoction, she explains that she's
been working 36 straight days without a break, and doing a lot of
traveling. In addition to the second season of ``Providence,''
which shoots primarily in Los Angeles, she's simultaneously
starring opposite Robert De Niro in ``15 Minutes,'' a psychological
drama that is filming in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Not that she's complaining, mind you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have been crazy,'' she says, ``but it's the best crazy
in the world. The only difficult thing is trying to sleep on
planes, but I discovered the secret to that.''
</P>
<P>
   She pulls out a mouth mask _ the kind Michael Jackson often
wears in public _ from an airline carry-on bag that lies nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was doing the eyepatch thing and the earplugs, but then
someone gave me this mask to avoid catching germs,'' she says.
``And, when you put it on, everyone thinks you're, like, this
complete lunatic, and they leave you alone. That's how you sleep on
a plane.''
</P>
<P>
   At 32, Kanakaredes is one of the rare few who didn't have to
struggle to win their spurs as actors. Born in Akron, Ohio, she
moved to New York straight out of college and soon landed a job as
Andros Cooper, the Greek heroine on ``Guiding Light.''
</P>
<P>
   During her fourth year on the soap, she began doing double duty
as Jimmy Smits' girlfriend on ``NYPD Blue.'' She followed that with
regular roles on ``Due South'' and in two short-lived series, ``New
York News'' with Mary Tyler Moore and ``Leaving L.A.'' Along the
way, she snagged small but spicy parts in the feature films ``The
Long Kiss Goodnight'' (1997) and ``Dangerous Beauty'' (1998).
</P>
<P>
   Then Kanakaredes signed a series-development deal with NBC ...
and, for a year and a half, turned down every pilot the network
offered her.
</P>
<P>
   Then one day the script for the premiere episode of
``Providence'' landed on her desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read it and loved it instantly,'' Kanakaredes says. ``I
thought it was fun, different, very moving. Unlike the other pilots
I'd read, `Providence' was something I was willing to devote years
of my life to.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I sent the script to all my testers _ my family and friends
who are not in show business _ and they had the same reaction,''
she adds. ``Then to have it hit so big with the audience was
amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   A midseason replacement relegated to television's dead zone _ 8
p.m. on Friday _ ``Providence'' debuted last January and stunned
the entire industry by becoming an immediate hit and the season's
highest-rated new drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's not just a chick show,'' Kanakaredes adds proudly.
``From the beginning we were pulling in millions of men, too. We've
completely changed Friday-night viewing habits _ now people will
stay home and watch `Providence,' then go out at 9.''
</P>
<P>
   After such early success, the producers have adopted an
if-it-ain't-broke-don't-fix-it attitude for the show's second year.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we will be more realistic about our characters'
feelings,'' Kanakaredes says. ``This season, we're really delving
into the relationship we all had with our mother, and that maybe
she and Syd really didn't like each other a lot, that maybe the
kids built their mother up to be somebody amazing when she really
wasn't. Or was it our fault that we really didn't get to know her?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to be hitting these deep, personal issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Married to her college boyfriend, chef Peter Constantinides,
Kanakaredes is notoriously private about her real-life family
matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain things I don't want to share with anybody,
and maybe I never will,'' she says. ``I chose a career in the
spotlight. My husband, my parents and my sisters did not.''
</P>
<P>
   She'll break that rule enough to insist that, despite how things
might appear, her hectic schedule with ``Providence'' and ``15
Minutes'' isn't any harder on her relationship with her husband
than usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been juggling since Day 1 of our marriage,'' she says.
``The nuttiness never ends. In fact, it's even nuttier when you're
not working, because then you're working even harder hustling,
auditioning, pursuing your goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter learned what show business is all about long ago,'' she
says affectionately. ``He didn't just come into it with my
`Providence' success.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, working with someone of De Niro's stature doesn't happen
to every young actress. Asked about working with the Hollywood
icon, Kanakaredes gasps, rolls her eyes heavenward and lets out a
delirious sigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phenomenal,'' she says. ``Just phenomenal. He is a god among
actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``But my audition for him was the most torturous night of my
life,'' she adds. ``I was supposed to meet De Niro at 6 p.m., so
I'm so nervous and crazed I was all ready by 3. Then they say, `De
Niro's running late. It'll be 6:30.' Then it was 7. Then 7:30. Then
8.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't meet him until a quarter to 9, at which point I was
like, `Oh, screw it, I don't care anymore! This sucks!' But when he
walked into the room, my heart stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanakaredes read two scenes from the film, then De Niro and
director John Herzfeld disappeared into another room for what she
says ``seemed like three hours, but was really only about 30
seconds. Then they came out and told me I had the part.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oscar-winning legend keeps in touch when Kanakaredes is
working on ``Providence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He just sort of calls up and says, `So ... like ... uh ...
howyadoon?''' she says, perfectly mimicking the actor's trademark
voice. ``And I'm like, `Robert De Niro is calling me _ This is too
damn weird!'''
</P>
<P>
   Also weird for Kanakaredes is that, after the success of
``Providence,'' her very complicated last name suddenly seems to
fall trippingly off of every tongue in Tinseltown.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning, everybody wanted me to change the name _
agents, managers, friends supposedly bearing good advice,'' she
recalls. ``But I'm not the type to bust my butt to achieve
something this difficult and not have it be me.''
</P>
<P>
   She pauses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really queer about it,'' she says. ``My father had three
daughters, and there's this Greek tradition about passing on the
family name. Well, that's not going to happen, but at least I can
keep the Kanakaredes name out there this way.''
</P>
<P>
   She sips her really incredible, really strong, iced Greek coffee
and breaks into a smile of really serene contentment.

GEORGE CLOONEY GOES FOR THE GOLD ON THE SILVER SCREEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 (Includes a color slide of George Clooney with Ice Cube and Mark
Wahlberg in a scene from ``Three Kings.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    George Clooney thinks he's a good actor. Sometimes, anyway.
 &HT;    ``Sometimes I am good,'' he explains. ``If I've got a good
script, I can do a good job. A good character can survive a lot of
things. There are things I've done that I like and things I've done
where I go, `Wow, I just missed that completely.'''
 &HT;    Among the latter, the one that he remembers most is ``Batman and
Robin'' (1997).
 &HT;    ``I whiffed,'' Clooney says matter-of-factly. ``I don't take
full heat for that personally. I do publicly. I go, `Hey, it
bombed. I'll take the heat.' I don't know what I could have done _
I saw part of it the other day on cable, and cringed through it.
 &HT;    ``It's a tough one,'' he says, ``because the script wasn't there
at all. For whatever reasons, I didn't get it, either _ I didn't
mesh with it.''
 &HT;    Clooney, the handsome and charismatic former star of
television's ``ER,'' has yet to score big on the big screen. Early
in his career he turned up in the likes of ``Return of the Killer
Tomatoes'' (1988), but since ``ER'' he's appeared in a number of
potential star-makers, including ``One Fine Day'' (1996), ``Batman
and Robin,'' ``The Peacemaker'' (1997) and ``Out of Sight'' (1998).
 &HT;    The actor earned kudos for ``One Fine Day'' and raves for ``Out
of Sight,'' but none of his films made much of a splash at the box
office. Clooney tries again on Oct. 1 with ``Three Kings,'' an
ambitious mix of black comedy, action and drama set amid the chaos
of the Gulf War.
 &HT;    Written and directed by David O. Russell, ``Three Kings'' plops
audiences into 1991 Iraq, where American ground troops sit idly
while jets handle the real fighting. Among the soldiers are
Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube and Spike Jonze _ all of whom,
upon hearing of a cease-fire agreement, can't wait to get home.
 &HT;    When the four discover a map revealing the site of Saddam
Hussein's secret stash of gold bullion, they go AWOL in an attempt
to get rich quick. However, their efforts to grab the gold bring
them face-to-face with the Iraqi people, forcing each man to
grapple with issues of morality and mortality.
 &HT;    Clooney loved the ``Three Kings'' script, but there were several
obstacles to his making the film _ most notably Mel Gibson and
Nicolas Cage.
 &HT;    ``I'm on a list and I'm down on that list, so you have to get
through those other guys,'' Clooney says, charming and honest as
usual during a conversation at New York's Essex House. ``I had to
take Mel, tie him up and keep him in my house.
 &HT;    ``They wanted Nic pretty badly for this, too,'' he adds. ``He
was really interested, but he had commitments to other films, thank
God.
 &HT;    ``I just kept lobbying,'' Clooney says with a laugh. ``I sent
David a letter. I followed him _ to this hotel, actually. I showed
up and said, `Come on, don't be a jerk. Give me the job.'
 &HT;    ``And I eventually got the job.''
 &HT;    As things finally worked out, ``Three Kings'' is a dizzying,
complex achievement, at once entertaining, funny, pointed,
thought-provoking and smart. In other words, it's everything that
``Wild Wild West'' (1999) was not _ which is just as well for
Clooney, who wisely pulled out of that project.
 &HT;    But if ``Wild Wild West'' proved too dumb for many audience's
taste, ``Three Kings'' might be too smart for its own good.
 &HT;    Clooney winces at the possibility _ much the same thing happened
to the engaging-but-little-seen ``Out of Sight'' _ but insists that
audiences will be able to handle ``Three Kings.''
 &HT;    ``When they screened `ER' for NBC,'' Clooney recalls, ``Don
Ohlmeyer and Warren Littlefield looked over at Les Moonves, who was
the head of Warner Bros. at the time, and said, `What the hell did
you do with our $3 million? No one will follow this show. There are
too many story lines _ the audience can't keep up.'
 &HT;    ``We tested it,'' he adds, ``and it tested through the roof.
They accused us of doctoring the testing, and went and brought in a
`Jay Leno' audience to prove us wrong. And it tested through the
roof, and was arguably one of the biggest hits of all time.''
 &HT;    Hollywood errs in assuming that moviegoers want only bland,
easily digested fare, Clooney believes.
 &HT;    ``I think we always underestimate the audience,'' he says. ``If
you play to dumb, you'll get dumb movies out there and people
saying `This is dumb.'
 &HT;    ``A lot of really good movies get made,'' the actor adds, ``and
people see them. I don't think we have to bring the bar down.''
 &HT;    Though Clooney still considers himself an actor for hire _ he
just wrapped the Coen Brothers' ``O Brother, Where Art Thou?'' and
is currently shooting ``The Perfect Storm,'' again co-starring
Wahlberg _ he's also attempting to take matters into his own hands
by producing films through his company, Maysville Pictures.
Maysville, he proudly reports, already has 35 scripts in various
stages of development at the major studios.
 &HT;    ``I can read a script and know whether or not I like it,'' he
says. ``Whether I'm right or not, time will tell.''
 &HT;    Time will tell, too, whether Clooney reprises his breakthrough
role as Dr. Doug Ross on ``ER.'' Recent tabloid stories blared that
producer John Wells would be bringing Clooney back for several
episodes _ including the finale for departing series veteran
Julianna Margulies _ at a staggering $2 million a pop.
 &HT;    ``I have only been asked once,'' Clooney says, ``and I was asked
a general question by John Wells. The question was, `Are you open
to the idea of coming back and getting Julianna off the show at the
end of the season?'
 &HT;    ``That's the only time we've talked,'' he says firmly, ``and
that's the only question that's been posed. All the other things
were completely made up.''
 &HT;    So what about that one question, then?
 &HT;    ``My answer to John was that anything that he could come up with
that would have to do with Julianna, I'd be happy to do,'' Clooney
says. ``These guys are really good friends _ not just the actors,
but the producers.''
 &HT;    That practical, down-to-earth thinking is typical of Clooney. It
might be smoke and mirrors _ after all, he's a good actor, right? _
but he exhibits a realistic sense of self, a drive to succeed and,
thankfully, an in-check ego.
 &HT;    ``Fifteen years from now I could be hit by a bus,'' he says
thoughtfully. ``I could be back on television.
 &HT;    ``People go, `So you're done with television for good?' You go
`Yeah,''' he says with a shrug. ``Everybody says, `For good,' but
there are plenty of people out there who are right back on
television series. Hopefully I won't have to rely just on people's
opinions of me.
 &HT;    ``That's why you have a production company, so you can do other
things,'' Clooney says. ``People get tired of seeing you. So I'll
have to have other jobs to fall back on.''

 (Includes a color slide of Rob Reiner with Bruce Willis in a scene
from ``The Story of Us.'') 
 By JEANNE WOLF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It's been a decade since actor/director Rob Reiner explored
romance and relationships in his hit comedy, ``When Harry Met
Sally'' (1989).
 &HT;    His new film, ``The Story of Us,'' takes that exploration one
long step further. Opening Oct. 15, it's the story of a husband and
wife (Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer) on the verge of divorce
after 15 years of marriage and two children.
 &HT;    Think of it as ``When Harry Got a Trial Separation From Sally.''
And, oh yeah, it's a comedy.
 &HT;    Reiner _ who directs and also plays Willis' best friend,
co-starring with Rita Wilson and Paul Reiser _ feels he's breaking
some new ground this time out.
 &HT;    ``There are a lot of movies about people falling in love and
people getting divorced,'' he says, ``but there aren't many that
deal with everything in-between _ the day-to-day wear and tear, the
ins and outs of a marriage.''
 &HT;    Writers Alan Zweibel and Jessie Nelson shared Reiner's
fascination with the subject, and the trio _ all married and with
children _ embarked upon a script-writing process which, Reiner
freely admits, drew heavily on their own experiences with ``til
death do us part.''
 &HT;    ``That's the only way you can create a film like this,'' the
director says. ``You only know what happens in your own marriage,
and you hope that other people will relate to what you've gone
through. It can be painful and uncomfortable to share those
details, but how else can you do it?
 &HT;    ``I think we hit on some basic truths that an audience is going
to identify with.''
 &HT;    Reiner was surprised to discover that his stars were quite a bit
like the characters they play _ Willis a not-very-practical writer
and Pfeiffer a hyperorganized control freak, two opposites who
originally attract and then start driving each other crazy.
 &HT;    ``Michelle is the earth mother of her own family, the designated
driver who likes to control everything,'' the director says.
``Bruce, on the other hand, doesn't color inside the lines. He's
all over the place.''
 &HT;    Ironically, while the actors were playing out a marriage on the
rocks in front of the cameras, both were facing similar emotional
challenges offscreen. Willis was engulfed in a tabloid frenzy over
his highly publicized separation from his wife, actress Demi Moore,
while Pfeiffer was coping with the death of her father.
 &HT;    ``It was tough on Bruce to be in the throes of a very difficult
breakup,'' Reiner says. ``We had some private conversations about
it, because he was really struggling with it.
 &HT;    ``You know, they talk about method acting, where you draw on
past experiences to get the right emotion for a scene,'' he adds.
``I think Bruce didn't have to look very far _ it was so fresh from
his life that he brought it right into the film ... I think it
ultimately helped his performance.''
 &HT;    He adds that the turmoil of a breakup is especially hard for a
celebrity on Willis' level.
 &HT;    ``You can hide a lot of the pain if you're an ordinary person,''
Reiner says. ``But you feel like you're sharing the most intimate
details of your life with strangers when the media puts you under a
microscope like he has been.''
 &HT;    Pfeiffer remains happily married to Emmy-winning producer/writer
David E. Kelley, but the death of her father took its toll.
 &HT;    ``It was a terrible loss for her,'' Reiner says. ``She was
struggling with her own demons. Even so, I think that she could use
some of it in her performance, as Bruce did.
 &HT;    ``It was tough for both of them, but they were unbelievably
professional.''
 &HT;    It's hard to believe that ``The Story of Us'' could be funny,
but Reiner insists that the angst and the laughs are carefully
balanced.
 &HT;    ``I think it's realistic,'' he says. ``Marriage is uncomfortable
and difficult, and it's also joyous and uplifting. But the biggest
challenge is to play something that's funny and real at the same
time _ to move people and make them laugh at the same time is the
hardest thing in the world.
 &HT;    ``Bruce and Michelle both have that gift. It's rare.''
 &HT;    Personally, he adds, he found the love scenes the most difficult
to direct.
 &HT;    ``I'm completely embarrassed by those scenes,'' Reiner admits,
``and I wish there was somebody else behind the camera when they do
them.
 &HT;    ``The easiest for me was the scene where they make love on the
kitchen butcher block,'' he says, ``because we played it for
laughs. But there's a moment in the montage at the end of the film
that's pretty much raw sex. That was uncomfortable.
 &HT;    ``But Michelle and Bruce were great,'' he adds, ``and I think
they were a lot less embarrassed than I was.''
 &HT;    Reiner, who many years ago went through his own much-publicized
divorce, from actress-turned-director Penny Marshall, is in a
long-running second marriage to photographer Michele Singer.
 &HT;    ``Since I put some of our own relationship into the film, it was
interesting to sit next to my wife at a screening,'' he says,
laughing. ``I remember the scene where there's this thing about not
replacing the toilet paper when the roll runs out. Michele looked
over at me and shook her head, because she's been on my case about
that kind of stuff.''
 &HT;    The director thinks he's a better husband the second time
around, in part because of his first marriage and even the divorce
that followed.
 &HT;    ``I went through some therapy after I got divorced, which gave
me a better understanding of what I'm bringing to a relationship
and what I can expect from my partner,'' he says. ``Understanding
is realizing that you are probably 50 percent of any problem. You
may not be able to change the other person, but at least you can
work on yourself and your own behavior.''
 &HT;    Reiner, a devoted father of three, readily admits that the
typical marriage's biggest hurdle is children.
 &HT;    ``I think Rita Wilson said on the set one day, `Kids are the
Jack Kevorkian of romance,''' he says with a laugh. ``We all know
what that means _ diaper changes, car-pool pickups ... Who's
picking them up from school? Who's taking them here or there?
 &HT;    ``It doesn't leave very much time for romance.''
 &HT;    He has a little secret to keep romance alive in his own home, he
adds.
 &HT;    ``You have to make dates,'' Reiner says with a chuckle. ``Like
you make a date to go out on Friday night. Otherwise you just get
lost in the day-to-day demands of family life, and you find
yourself disengaging like the couple in the film.''
 &HT;    He stops in thought.
 &HT;    ``What's the secret to a good marriage?'' he asks rhetorically.
``I guess you've got to be good friends. You've got to connect on a
lot of levels, and you really have to work to have a great
understanding of each other.
 &HT;    ``If you can do that, then you can weather any storm.''

 (Includes a color slide of Molly Shannon in a scene from
``Superstar.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    A hospital waiting room doesn't seem like the place to get your
start in stand-up comedy, but 4-year-old Molly Shannon didn't
choose it.
 &HT;    That choice was made by the driver who killed her mother.
 &HT;    It was raining that day, Shannon recalls _ nearly three decades
later, she remembers the details as if it were only yesterday.
 &HT;    Her father pulled out of a Fourth of July picnic in a car filled
with laughing females _ his wife, their daughters Molly and Mary,
and a niece. He never even saw the speeding car that veered from
the oncoming lane and skidded in their direction.
 &HT;    ``It was just a real bad wipeout,'' Shannon recalls. ``My mother
and my cousin died in front of me.''
 &HT;    Molly, the smallest girl in the car, was the least injured.
While doctors worked over her father and sister, a nurse dumped the
frightened, confused preschooler in the hospital waiting room.
 &HT;    ``I spent my time there trying to make the other kids laugh,
figuring that they had it worse than me,'' she recalls. ``It's
strange what you remember, but I think that's where comedy started
for me.
 &HT;    ``I come from a sad place, and the only way I could make peace
with it was by making others laugh.''
 &HT;    Shannon has kept on making people laugh _ at 33, she's a
``Saturday Night Live'' regular best known for her recurring
character Mary Katherine Gallagher, an overweight, awkward Catholic
schoolgirl who, on Oct. 8, will become the heroine of her own
movie, ``Superstar.''
 &HT;    Over coffee in her suite at Los Angeles' Four Seasons hotel,
Shannon doesn't look much like Mary Katherine. Thin and stylish in
a red sweater and black pants, she readily admits that Mary
Katherine and her dreams of superstardom grew out of Shannon's own
tragic childhood.
 &HT;    ``Almost every time you meet a funny person, they've probably
done a lot of crying on the inside,'' she says. ``It's not just a
saying _ it's true.
 &HT;    ``My dream was to feel happy.''
 &HT;    Shannon is currently riding a hot streak _ besides
``Superstar,'' she also has a role in Ron Howard's upcoming
adaptation of the Dr. Seuss classic, ``The Grinch Who Stole
Christmas.'' But she remembers all too well the way things used to
be.
 &HT;    ``My character Mary Katherine loses her parents when the film
begins,'' Shannon says. ``She feels like such a loser _ she feels
like nothing. She also feels like she's waiting for something to
erase the hurt. In her case, it's stardom.
 &HT;    ``I understand her,'' the comedian says. ``I know of her drive
to get to a place where you won't feel like nothing.''
 &HT;    For herself, Shannon adds, she's found that place.
 &HT;    ``I've made peace with my past,'' she says quietly. ``In fact,
the only thing that really depresses me now is that I don't have a
date for the millennium _ but the year is still young.''
 &HT;    Growing up in Cleveland, she recalls, her active fantasy life
laid the groundwork for her career as a performer. Isolated from
those around her _ her father's legs were crushed in the accident,
so for a long time Shannon and her sister were deprived of both
parents _ she turned inward for support.
 &HT;    ``I remember I had a piano teacher who wore a big, flowing
blouse and doused on the perfume,'' she says. ``I'd sit next to her
and she'd be like, `La, la, la-de-da _ play those notes.' But I
wasn't paying attention because her blouse would touch me and I'd
think of my mom.
 &HT;    ``But then I'd actually move away,'' she adds. ``I didn't want
to get too close.''
 &HT;    Distrustful of the outside world, she retreated into a realm of
her own.
 &HT;    ``At home, I went into a fantasy world which was all about me
playing and inventing characters,'' Shannon says. ``It was an
escape hatch into a place where there was nothing wrong. It was
acting.''
 &HT;    Simultaneously, she was unknowingly accumulating material for
Mary Katherine's future routines.
 &HT;    ``On top of my tragic childhood, I had to go to Catholic
school,'' Shannon says, laughing.
 &HT;    ``On the serious side, all that pressure at school to be a good
girl keeps you from getting angry about stuff,'' she adds. ``And I
think it's good to get angry about stuff.
 &HT;    ``At night I'd go to parties and make out and drink,'' she
recalls. ``But if a boy wanted to get serious, I'd be like, `No
way.' If somebody wanted to get too close, I was like, `I'm out of
here.' I dumped them.
 &HT;    ``Fear of intimacy,'' she says with a shrug. ``And I'm still
working on it.''
 &HT;    Shannon even once considered becoming a nun.
 &HT;    ``I did want to become a nun,'' she admits, laughing. ``In fact,
I pretended I was a nun all the time. But the problem is that I
wanted to be a sexy nun, which didn't go over big at school.''
 &HT;    Even now, after she's achieved success with ``Saturday Night
Live'' and laid some of her ghosts to rest, Shannon spends a lot of
time alone.
 &HT;    ``I don't like to go out much,'' she says. ``I honestly think it
makes you a different kind of woman when you're raised by a man. I
always saw things from a man's point of view _ I became very
work-oriented.
 &HT;    ``In fact, I had to find the womanly part of myself recently,''
she adds. ``I had to sort of discover that you can work and have
that other part of yourself.''
 &HT;    As for affairs of the heart, Shannon says with a roll of her
eyes that there's nothing much going on at the moment. In fact, she
says, her romantic life peaked at age 6.
 &HT;    ``I used to go into the bushes with Tommy Sullivan and smooch
with him,'' she says cheerfully. ``It was really nice. We just
kissed and kissed. And it was actually a very healthy relationship.
 &HT;    ``Love went downhill from there.''
 &HT;    Like Mary Katherine, however, Shannon never gives up hope.
 &HT;    ``I hope that I'm in a healthy relationship by the millennium,''
she says, ``because that's important. I want to be enjoying my life
a little bit more.''

 (Includes a color slide of Melina Kanakaredes with Paula Cale, Mike
Farrell and Seth Peterson in a scene from ``Providence.'') 
 By MICHAEL LOGAN  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Melina Kanakaredes is either supremely self-confident or
thoroughly lacking in ego. Or perhaps both.
</P>
<P>
   The leading lady of the red-hot NBC drama ``Providence'' is
conducting an early-morning interview in her trailer near the set,
but because she has not yet reported to the hair-and-makeup
department, her famous curls have not been coiffed and her face is
without even a touch of cosmetics.
</P>
<P>
   For an actress to appear this way in front of a reporter is a
virtually unprecedented act of daring. But she needn't fret _ even
sans artificial enhancement, she is an incandescent beauty.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, she is the perfect hostess.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make these really incredible, really strong, iced Greek
coffees. Would you like one?'' Kanakaredes says, sprinting to the
trailer's mini-kitchen. ``I'm surviving on sugar and caffeine these
days.''
</P>
<P>
   As the actress whips up her concoction, she explains that she's
been working 36 straight days without a break, and doing a lot of
traveling. In addition to the second season of ``Providence,''
which shoots primarily in Los Angeles, she's simultaneously
starring opposite Robert De Niro in ``15 Minutes,'' a psychological
drama that is filming in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Not that she's complaining, mind you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have been crazy,'' she says, ``but it's the best crazy
in the world. The only difficult thing is trying to sleep on
planes, but I discovered the secret to that.''
</P>
<P>
   She pulls out a mouth mask _ the kind Michael Jackson often
wears in public _ from an airline carry-on bag that lies nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was doing the eyepatch thing and the earplugs, but then
someone gave me this mask to avoid catching germs,'' she says.
``And, when you put it on, everyone thinks you're, like, this
complete lunatic, and they leave you alone. That's how you sleep on
a plane.''
</P>
<P>
   At 32, Kanakaredes is one of the rare few who didn't have to
struggle to win their spurs as actors. Born in Akron, Ohio, she
moved to New York straight out of college and soon landed a job as
Andros Cooper, the Greek heroine on ``Guiding Light.''
</P>
<P>
   During her fourth year on the soap, she began doing double duty
as Jimmy Smits' girlfriend on ``NYPD Blue.'' She followed that with
regular roles on ``Due South'' and in two short-lived series, ``New
York News'' with Mary Tyler Moore and ``Leaving L.A.'' Along the
way, she snagged small but spicy parts in the feature films ``The
Long Kiss Goodnight'' (1997) and ``Dangerous Beauty'' (1998).
</P>
<P>
   Then Kanakaredes signed a series-development deal with NBC ...
and, for a year and a half, turned down every pilot the network
offered her.
</P>
<P>
   Then one day the script for the premiere episode of
``Providence'' landed on her desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read it and loved it instantly,'' Kanakaredes says. ``I
thought it was fun, different, very moving. Unlike the other pilots
I'd read, `Providence' was something I was willing to devote years
of my life to.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I sent the script to all my testers _ my family and friends
who are not in show business _ and they had the same reaction,''
she adds. ``Then to have it hit so big with the audience was
amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   A midseason replacement relegated to television's dead zone _ 8
p.m. on Friday _ ``Providence'' debuted last January and stunned
the entire industry by becoming an immediate hit and the season's
highest-rated new drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's not just a chick show,'' Kanakaredes adds proudly.
``From the beginning we were pulling in millions of men, too. We've
completely changed Friday-night viewing habits _ now people will
stay home and watch `Providence,' then go out at 9.''
</P>
<P>
   After such early success, the producers have adopted an
if-it-ain't-broke-don't-fix-it attitude for the show's second year.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we will be more realistic about our characters'
feelings,'' Kanakaredes says. ``This season, we're really delving
into the relationship we all had with our mother, and that maybe
she and Syd really didn't like each other a lot, that maybe the
kids built their mother up to be somebody amazing when she really
wasn't. Or was it our fault that we really didn't get to know her?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to be hitting these deep, personal issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Married to her college boyfriend, chef Peter Constantinides,
Kanakaredes is notoriously private about her real-life family
matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain things I don't want to share with anybody,
and maybe I never will,'' she says. ``I chose a career in the
spotlight. My husband, my parents and my sisters did not.''
</P>
<P>
   She'll break that rule enough to insist that, despite how things
might appear, her hectic schedule with ``Providence'' and ``15
Minutes'' isn't any harder on her relationship with her husband
than usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been juggling since Day 1 of our marriage,'' she says.
``The nuttiness never ends. In fact, it's even nuttier when you're
not working, because then you're working even harder hustling,
auditioning, pursuing your goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter learned what show business is all about long ago,'' she
says affectionately. ``He didn't just come into it with my
`Providence' success.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, working with someone of De Niro's stature doesn't happen
to every young actress. Asked about working with the Hollywood
icon, Kanakaredes gasps, rolls her eyes heavenward and lets out a
delirious sigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phenomenal,'' she says. ``Just phenomenal. He is a god among
actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``But my audition for him was the most torturous night of my
life,'' she adds. ``I was supposed to meet De Niro at 6 p.m., so
I'm so nervous and crazed I was all ready by 3. Then they say, `De
Niro's running late. It'll be 6:30.' Then it was 7. Then 7:30. Then
8.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't meet him until a quarter to 9, at which point I was
like, `Oh, screw it, I don't care anymore! This sucks!' But when he
walked into the room, my heart stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanakaredes read two scenes from the film, then De Niro and
director John Herzfeld disappeared into another room for what she
says ``seemed like three hours, but was really only about 30
seconds. Then they came out and told me I had the part.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oscar-winning legend keeps in touch when Kanakaredes is
working on ``Providence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He just sort of calls up and says, `So ... like ... uh ...
howyadoon?''' she says, perfectly mimicking the actor's trademark
voice. ``And I'm like, `Robert De Niro is calling me _ This is too
damn weird!'''
</P>
<P>
   Also weird for Kanakaredes is that, after the success of
``Providence,'' her very complicated last name suddenly seems to
fall trippingly off of every tongue in Tinseltown.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning, everybody wanted me to change the name _
agents, managers, friends supposedly bearing good advice,'' she
recalls. ``But I'm not the type to bust my butt to achieve
something this difficult and not have it be me.''
</P>
<P>
   She pauses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really queer about it,'' she says. ``My father had three
daughters, and there's this Greek tradition about passing on the
family name. Well, that's not going to happen, but at least I can
keep the Kanakaredes name out there this way.''
</P>
<P>
   She sips her really incredible, really strong, iced Greek coffee
and breaks into a smile of really serene contentment.

THE GOLD RUSH AT THE NEW MILLENNIUM 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The next millennium is a few weeks away, and
already it's a bore. And not even a crashing bore.
</P>
<P>
   No, computers won't crash in the numbers we hoped for. The world
probably won't end. If a new Messiah appears, he'll get caught in
traffic because the Golden Gate Bridge will be closed for an
idiotic party.
</P>
<P>
   The future is always a disappointment when it arrives. In an age
of mega-hype, the future is a disappointment in advance. We know
we're never getting world peace, colonies on other planets, food in
convenient squeeze tubes or those personal jet packs we were
promised long ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never think of the future. It comes soon enough,'' Albert
Einstein said in 1930, a hard year for the then-future.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing we have is the present, which always gets a bad
rap for not being as good as the past, particularly in
nostalgia-ridden San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The way to think of the present, though, is as the future we
never could have predicted.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter of a century ago, who would have guessed that young
people moving to San Francisco would have short hair and
responsible jobs, while the district attorney would support pot
smoking and both free and paid love?
</P>
<P>
   We never expected that smoking pot would be legal and smoking
tobacco would be punishable by expulsion from office buildings onto
the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   Way back in 1974 an economist would have been drummed out of his
dismal science if he predicted the center of the world's economic
universe would shift to Palo Alto, then a sleepy college town with
Ramona's Pizza and a few young guys tinkering in garages.
</P>
<P>
   We never imagined staring into a box that brings the Bay Area
billions of dollars and allows us to communicate with people all
over the world, and that most of them would be pornographers.
</P>
<P>
   Look at this place. We don't have flying Jetsons cars, but we
have things we never imagined. We have companies that make millions
before they've even thought of their products. Trust me, the snake
oil is in the e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   We have phone booths that travel the highways at 70 mph. The
phones themselves are getting so small that it takes sidewalk
psychiatric work-ups to tell yuppies with lattes from
schizophrenics with cups.
</P>
<P>
   Women drive tanks and wear army boots. Men wear clown-colored
tights on bicycles. Enough said about gender play.
</P>
<P>
   We have homeless. Twenty-five years ago we didn't even have that
word as a noun. We just had transients, and except for one lady
with balloons in back of the Emporium, they mostly did move on.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of us never would have guessed that we'd all be living
in half-million-dollar homes and $2,000-a-month apartments _ or
catching a few winks in them between jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The Bay Area now has outhouses in front of posh houses. Stock
market profits are being funneled directly into renovation and
expansion of homes, and workers aren't allowed to use the
bathrooms. You might want to invest in Port-a-Potty Inc.
</P>
<P>
   San Franciscans always have been serious eaters, but when I
moved here in the '70s I had no idea how serious food would become.
I imagined eating petrale at the Tadich Grill and onion cakes at
the Hunan for the rest of a short, lipid-filled life.
</P>
<P>
   Never in my wildest dreams did I think that dining out would
become a competitive event, with points scored for beating friends
and critics to the latest palace of attitudinal chow, and points
subtracted for still going there after it becomes easy to get a
reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Food never became containers of colored goo like the astronauts
ate in ``2001'' _ except on airliners. Instead we're eating noodles
colored with the black stuff that squid squirt and shrimp entrapped
in gelatin pyramids.
</P>
<P>
   Tell me this isn't a civilization at its pinnacle. Waiter, the
hummingbird tongues.
</P>
<P>
   We even can get garlic fries at the ballpark, and soon a
glorious new ballpark to go with the fries. A quarter of a century
ago, we thought we'd always have to watch baseball in a concrete
toilet in gale-force winds.
</P>
<P>
   This week San Franciscans will attend their last Giants game at
Candlestick Park. Many will have tears in their eyes _ and not just
from the cold wind and peanut dust. San Franciscans will get
nostalgic about anything.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I don't like to look back, because the future is
gaining on me.
</P>

   GURU _ Thousands have meditated in Fairfield, Iowa, for 25 years
to attain near-supernatural clarity of mind and, while they're at
it, create world peace. These devotees of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi
think his trademarked Transcendental Meditation techniques can
actually make them float on air. Most recently they've constructed
new homes and office buildings, or retrofitted old ones, to face
east because the Maharishi suggests that's the best way to capture
the energy of the rising sun. The locals aren't buying it. ``We're
Midwesterners here,'' said city council member Neil Doyle. ``You
come in here with some fairly crazy philosophy and we don't swallow
it all.'' Yet, Doyle and others note, the past quarter-century has
shown that a small Midwestern town can absorb, if not really
integrate, a sizable immigration of rather unorthodox outsiders.
Particularly when the outsiders bring money and jobs. 50. Scott

   DOG: This is the story of three strangers who came together over
one man's grief. An Overland Park man lost his dog last month. That
dog was all he had in the world. He went out at 4 a.m. screaming
and crying through his neighborhood looking for it. No luck. He
called the Lost Dog Registry in Kansas City. This group kept a
lookout for it but was losing hope. Then the dog happened to wander
by the house of an Overland Park woman. Her kids wanted to keep it.
Nevertheless, she turned in the dog to the Lost Dog Registry too.
Man and dog were reunited through the kindness of strangers. 30.

message from the Darwin fish contingent? That's what Tom Lessl
wanted to find out. He's an associate professor of speech
communication at the University of Georgia. Even before the state
school board debate over evolution erupted in Kansas, he was
walking parking lots in five states looking for Darwin fish,
distributing questionnaires.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wore out two pairs of shoes,'' Lessl said.
</P>
<P>
   Such emblems can be powerful statements, just like national
flags, and people invest their identities in them, he said. More
than that, the Darwin fish folks appropriated a religious symbol

 &HT;    UNITED NATIONS _ Blue helmets decorated with U.N. flags, the
gleaming horizontal General Assembly building, feverish midnight
debates in the Security Council: These are well-known public images
of the United Nations at work. Behind the scenes, however, is an
equally far-reaching site of intense activity: the press room,
known as Room 226.
 &HT;    At the moment, Room 226 is under threat by a move that could
muzzle reporters.
 &HT;    In December, the General Assembly adopted a resolution, ``United
Nations Public Information Policies and Activities,'' which
contains a paragraph _ specifically, number 12 _ allowing diplomats
into the news briefings. A new resolution is calling on
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to enforce the December vote.
 &HT;    ``It's absolutely ridiculous,'' one Western diplomat said about
the measure, which was initiated by Algeria, and strongly supported
by Syria and Cuba.
 &HT;    I'm told that so far, no diplomats have tried to enter Room 226,
and that if they do, they'll be turned away.
 &HT;    To be perfectly clear, the press room is the site of conferences
on any number of hot issues of the day: Iraq, Kosovo, East Timor,
the World Bank, global crime, humanitarian relief, the threat of
landmines, famines and epidemics. The noon briefings are given by
Fred Eckhard, the chief U.N. spokesman, or a deputy. Other
sessions, which must be cleared through his office, are often
conducted by presidents and prime ministers, other top government
officials or U.N. experts on subjects ranging from nuclear weapons
to global infant mortality.
 &HT;    Within the U.N. press corps _ about 150 resident correspondents
and thousands of others accredited from international media
organizations _ there's the free press (major U.S. networks, the
BBC, The Times of India, etc.) as well as official government news
agencies (from China, Indonesia, Iraq, Yugoslavia, etc.).
 &HT;    I spoke to one Third World journalist who said she believes the
diplomats want to be in Room 226 to spy. She feels it would be like
Big Brother taking notes. She says that some reporters already feel
they're at personal risk for not always portraying their political
leaders in a glowing light.
 &HT;    Other colleagues, particularly from authoritarian regimes, fear
being isolated or tagged as traitors or troublemakers. They don't
want to be seen asking ``hostile'' questions whose answers might
put their states in a bad light. They say they fear that such
behavior might prompt a call to return home for reprisal or
dismissal.
 &HT;    In any country, government officials make their displeasure
known. For example, I got a call from a Western European diplomat
complaining about my characterizing his country as an ``ally'' of
Iraq. Instead, he said, it was merely a ``supporter.'' Other
correspondents have more frightening stories of harassment to tell.
 &HT;    The new measure is all the more ironic because the U.N.
briefings are not secret proceedings. A camera is posted in back of
the rows of chairs to broadcast events live over the U.N.-TV
system, on the Internet and on local cable television. Monitors are
scattered around the headquarters _ at the delegates' entrance, in
the main lobby near the newsstand. A live audio feed runs to the
diplomatic missions. Transcripts are on the Net at www.un.org.
Every afternoon Eckhard, or his deputy, repeats the sessions for
diplomats, including the questions asked by reporters and the
responses.
 &HT;    True, the live broadcasts do not show the journalists' faces as
they ask questions. Only their voices are heard. But isn't that
enough?
 &HT;    Even now, without a camera in their faces, the more vulnerable
reporters will pass a tough question to a Western colleague to ask.
They fear voice recognition or the chance that a diplomat will
check around later to find out who asked what.
 &HT;    If the doors to Room 226 were open to all, the news briefings
might well turn into battles between advocates of clashing points
of view on the most politically sensitive, life-and-death issues
facing the world's people, rather than a forum in which you can
gather facts, figure out what's news and try to find the truth.
 &HT;    At times, bureaucrats or lobbyists or people from
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) try to slip into the room,
but a U.N. staffer at the door rejects anyone without proper press
credentials. For security problems, a uniformed officer is shouting
distance away in the nearby diplomatic corridor.
 &HT;    The week of Sept. 20, when the General Assembly opened, there
were sessions on such issues as the death of a Western journalist
in East Timor, the rescue of Taipei earthquake victims, combatting
drug trafficking in Colombia, and Pakistan's case against India in
the International Court of Justice over the shoot-down of an
unarmed Pakistani aircraft. In a Sept. 22 meeting, journalists
questioned President Miguel Angel Rodriguez Echeverria about Costa
Rica's stance against the Cuban embargo.
 &HT;    Clearly these aren't lunch-time chats.
 &HT;    Should diplomats from Indonesia be at a news briefing on East
Timor, ready to challenge whatever the press spokesman is saying?
Should those from Pakistan be able to try to advance their own
national agenda at a briefing about India?
 &HT;    I asked one member of the Information Committee, the key U.N.
group that introduced the resolution, why his colleagues who
support a free press didn't refuse to go along with paragraph 12 or
try to negotiate it out of the whole package.
 &HT;    At the time, he told me, there was concern, but there were
``bigger fish to fry'' _ by which he meant, at least in part, that
it was more important to avoid a power struggle and keep the
committee on track and running smoothly by consensus than to stand
up and fight for press rights.
 &HT;    Historically, this committee has been a site of contentious
debate. The members from East and West, and First and Third Worlds,
who have been reared in traditions that range from censorship to
freedom of speech, hold widely divergent views on what sort of
information should be made public _ all of it, part of it, none of
it or an official version of it.
 &HT;    A few members of the U.N. Correspondents Association are trying
to raise a red flag because buried as paragraph 12 is in the
original resolution, the demand to open the press-room doors hasn't
even been read yet by the majority of people it would most directly
affect.
 &HT;    If the new resolution passes _ it's on track for adoption by
November or December _ it could well provoke a major confrontation.
High-level U.N. officials say that Annan _ who dearly respects
freedom of speech and has called press freedom ``a cornerstone of
human rights'' _ will never allow diplomats the press-room access
they seek.
 &HT;    If the secretary-general rides in on a white horse to save the
day, he should do it. The problem is, nobody knows what the next
secretary-general will be inclined to do.

the measure, which was initiated by Algeria, and strongly supported
by Syria and Cuba.
 &HT;    I'm told that so far, no diplomats have tried to enter Room 226,
and that if they do, they'll be turned away.
 &HT;    To be perfectly clear, the press room is the site of conferences
on any number of hot issues of the day: Iraq, Kosovo, East Timor,
the World Bank, global crime, humanitarian relief, the threat of
landmines, famines and epidemics. The noon briefings are given by
Fred Eckhard, the chief U.N. spokesman, or a deputy. Other
sessions, which must be cleared through his office, are often
conducted by presidents and prime ministers, other top government
officials or U.N. experts on subjects ranging from nuclear weapons
to global infant mortality.
 &HT;    Within the U.N. press corps _ about 150 resident correspondents
and thousands of others accredited from international media
organizations _ there's the free press (major U.S. networks, the
BBC, The Times of India, etc.) as well as official government news
agencies (from China, Indonesia, Iraq, Yugoslavia, etc.).
 &HT;    I spoke to one Third World journalist who said she believes the
diplomats want to be in Room 226 to spy. She feels it would be like
Big Brother taking notes. She says that some reporters already feel
they're at personal risk for not always portraying their political
leaders in a glowing light.
 &HT;    Other colleagues, particularly from authoritarian regimes, fear
being isolated or tagged as traitors or troublemakers. They don't
want to be seen asking ``hostile'' questions whose answers might
put their states in a bad light. They say they fear that such
behavior might prompt a call to return home for reprisal or
dismissal.
 &HT;    In any country, government officials make their displeasure
known. For example, I got a call from a Western European diplomat
complaining about my characterizing his country as an ``ally'' of
Iraq. Instead, he said, it was merely a ``supporter.'' Other
correspondents have more frightening stories of harassment to tell.
 &HT;    The new measure is all the more ironic because the U.N.
briefings are not secret proceedings. A camera is posted in back of
the rows of chairs to broadcast events live over the U.N.-TV
system, on the Internet and on local cable television. Monitors are
scattered around the headquarters _ at the delegates' entrance, in
the main lobby near the newsstand. A live audio feed runs to the
diplomatic missions. Transcripts are on the Net at www.un.org.
Every afternoon Eckhard, or his deputy, repeats the sessions for
diplomats, including the questions asked by reporters and the
responses.
 &HT;    True, the live broadcasts do not show the journalists' faces as
they ask questions. Only their voices are heard. But isn't that
enough?
 &HT;    Even now, without a camera in their faces, the more vulnerable
reporters will pass a tough question to a Western colleague to ask.
They fear voice recognition or the chance that a diplomat will
check around later to find out who asked what.
 &HT;    If the doors to Room 226 were open to all, the news briefings
might well turn into battles between advocates of clashing points
of view on the most politically sensitive, life-and-death issues
facing the world's people, rather than a forum in which you can
gather facts, figure out what's news and try to find the truth.
 &HT;    At times, bureaucrats or lobbyists or people from
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) try to slip into the room,
but a U.N. staffer at the door rejects anyone without proper press
credentials. For security problems, a uniformed officer is shouting
distance away in the nearby diplomatic corridor.
 &HT;    The week of Sept. 20, when the General Assembly opened, there
were sessions on such issues as the death of a Western journalist
in East Timor, the rescue of Taipei earthquake victims, combatting
drug trafficking in Colombia, and Pakistan's case against India in
the International Court of Justice over the shoot-down of an
unarmed Pakistani aircraft. In a Sept. 22 meeting, journalists
questioned President Miguel Angel Rodriguez Echeverria about Costa
Rica's stance against the Cuban embargo.
 &HT;    Clearly these aren't lunch-time chats.
 &HT;    Should diplomats from Indonesia be at a news briefing on East
Timor, ready to challenge whatever the press spokesman is saying?
Should those from Pakistan be able to try to advance their own
national agenda at a briefing about India?
 &HT;    I asked one member of the Information Committee, the key U.N.
group that introduced the resolution, why his colleagues who
support a free press didn't refuse to go along with paragraph 12 or
try to negotiate it out of the whole package.
 &HT;    At the time, he told me, there was concern, but there were
``bigger fish to fry'' _ by which he meant, at least in part, that
it was more important to avoid a power struggle and keep the
committee on track and running smoothly by consensus than to stand
up and fight for press rights.
 &HT;    Historically, this committee has been a site of contentious
debate. The members from East and West, and First and Third Worlds,
who have been reared in traditions that range from censorship to
freedom of speech, hold widely divergent views on what sort of
information should be made public _ all of it, part of it, none of
it or an official version of it.
 &HT;    A few members of the U.N. Correspondents Association are trying
to raise a red flag because buried as paragraph 12 is in the
original resolution, the demand to open the press-room doors hasn't
even been read yet by the majority of people it would most directly
affect.
 &HT;    If the new resolution passes _ it's on track for adoption by
November or December _ it could well provoke a major confrontation.
High-level U.N. officials say that Annan _ who dearly respects
freedom of speech and has called press freedom ``a cornerstone of
human rights'' _ will never allow diplomats the press-room access
they seek.
 &HT;    If the secretary-general rides in on a white horse to save the
day, he should do it. The problem is, nobody knows what the next
secretary-general will be inclined to do.

CBS : `Everybody Loves Raymond' 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID KRONKE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There are two pockets of major viewer indecision
this season, where the networks' schedules have an unfortunate _
and rare _ confluence of quality programming.
</P>
<P>
   One falls at 9 p.m. Wednesdays, when NBC's terrific new
presidential drama ``The West Wing'' goes up against the WB's
promising alien-teen saga ``Roswell'' and Drew Carey's
working-class-shlub sitcom on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   The other is even more problematic _ 9 p.m. Mondays. Even if
there isn't a good game on ABC's ``Monday Night Football,'' you
still have an embarrassment of riches _ NBC's spin-off ``Law &AMP;
Order: Special Victims Unit,'' Fox phenomenon ``Ally McBeal'' and
CBS' newly venerable sitcom, ``Everybody Loves Raymond.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Raymond'' surprised everybody _ including those who work on it
_ when it not only held its own opposite ``Ally McBeal'' last year
but actually beat it in the ratings. This year, NBC _ which was
pretty much a Monday no-show last season _ is mounting a strong
offensive, so all involved on each show will have to be at the top
of their game to survive the audience feeding frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's episode, the second of the season, offers a solid
example of why ``Raymond'' is so beloved: Ray (Ray Romano) and
Debra (Patricia Heaton) have had an argument. Ray's resentful
brother, Robert (Brad Garrett), relishes hearing Debra slag her
husband, while Ray's mom (Doris Roberts) _ one of the most covertly
sinister characters on TV, who loves to foment familial discord _
goes moony hearing Ray complain about his wife. When she asks Ray
to go into detail over his woes, Frank (Peter Boyle), Ray's crank
of a father, answers her succinctly: ``He's married.'' Frank also
reveals the secret of an enduring marriage _ ``You can't get upset
with a crazy person.''
</P>
<P>
   From this setup, we go into a standard-issue ``Rashomon''
routine, with Ray and Debra giving their wildly contrasting views
on what started the tiff. The comic twist comes when Ray's parents
actually manage to supercede his argument with Debra with a fierce
clash of their own and and yet still manage to end the episode
conspiratorially sniggering at their children's distress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' is the rare show that happily
accepts the conventions and limitations of a certain genre and
actually uses them to their best advantage. No one here speaks to
the camera or makes trendy pop-culture references, and even though
Ray's a sportswriter, there's never any self-reflexive commentary
about the media. The actors never wink at the audience. There are
no visual or audio pyrotechnics, or any cutting-edge technical
work, and the plots aren't willfully quirky _ indeed, as in
tonight's episode, they simply find gags in the banal minutiae of
everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raymond'' simply tells a little story that puts a sunny face
on the darker side of family life and sprinkles in some smart punch
lines. Dispensing with the gimmicks that may date other shows in
the future, ``Raymond'' doesn't try to be trendy, which may be why
it's routinely snubbed at the Emmys (last year was the first time
it even got nominations). Rather than aspiring to be the sensation
of the moment, ``Raymond'' aims for TV Land immortality. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The show: ``Everybody Loves Raymond.'' &QL; 
What: Second episode of the season of the dysfunctional family
sitcom. &QL; 
Who: Ray Romano, Patricia Heaton, Doris Roberts, Peter Boyle, Brad
Garrett. &QL; 
Where: CBS (Channel 2). &QL; 
When: 9 tonight. &QL; 
Rating: 3 1/2 stars &QL;

TOBACCO SUIT HAS POLITICS WRITTEN ALL OVER IT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Greg Little, one of the tobacco industry's top
lawyers, didn't mince words when the federal government filed its
huge lawsuit against his clients the other day.
</P>
<P>
   Little called the action ``politically correct extortion.''
</P>
<P>
   I will let the courts _ if this suit goes anywhere _ determine
whether extortion is involved here. But there isn't any question
that the action was politically correct, particularly for a
Democratic administration.
</P>
<P>
   For countless politicians, especially _ but not exclusively _
Democrats, cigarette makers have become a double-opportunity
target.
</P>
<P>
   Americans' increasing health consciousness and mounting evidence
that tobacco companies tried for years to hide the addictive
dangers of smoking from the public have painted the industry as the
evil empire, deserving repeated political assaults.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's huge financial success, moreover, has made it the
ultimate cash cow, something to be milked for more than the
billions of dollars in state and federal taxes it has long been
pumping into state and federal treasuries.
</P>
<P>
   I will reserve comment on the potential merits of the Department
of Justice's suit. But the action certainly has politics written
all over it, coming, as it did, more than halfway through President
Clinton's last term and on the heels of tobacco's
multibillion-dollar settlements of similar state suits seeking
recovery of tax dollars spent on smoking-related health care.
</P>
<P>
   There even may be some truth to the industry's assertion that
one reason the suit was filed was to give Vice President Al Gore a
popular issue in his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The industry immediately vowed not to settle, a declaration that
can't be taken totally at face value given the way the tobacco
companies caved in to the states. A tobacco lawyer made a similar
vow not too many months before his clients agreed to pay $17.3
billion over the next 25 years to end Texas' suit.
</P>
<P>
   But cigarette makers may be ready to draw the line for real this
time. They certainly won't agree to any settlement before next
year's election, which could change the outlook from the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential
front-runner, may be the tobacco companies' least painful
alternative. Bush is a strong opponent of lawsuits against
businesses, even controversial ones.
</P>
<P>
   During his first year in office in 1995, he championed
significant changes in Texas' civil justice laws, and this year he
signed a bill to prohibit local governments from suing gun
manufacturers for damages without the Legislature's permission.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had nothing to do with Texas' anti-tobacco suit, except to
jump in after the settlement was negotiated to fight the high fees
awarded to the outside plaintiffs' lawyers who had helped former
Democratic Attorney General Dan Morales win Texas' big payoff.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting trial lawyers, of course, is a favorite sport for most
Republicans, since trial lawyers are a major source of funding for
Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Texas probably would have never even sued the tobacco industry
if the decision had been left up to the governor or the
Legislature. The suit was Morales' call alone, acting as the
state's top lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Scott McClellan pointed out, after the federal
suit was filed, that Bush ``as a general principle'' doesn't like
lawsuits. But he said it would be inappropriate for Bush to say
more until he learns more about the case.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the tobacco industry already is trying to work on
the governor, as well as other policy-makers and the public.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris Inc., the biggest tobacco company, released its
own economic analysis, claiming that the federal action, if
successful, could reduce Texas' settlement payout by as much as
$213 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco executives also are generously contributing to Bush's
presidential campaign. According to research by The Dallas Morning
News, tobacco executives and their spouses gave Bush nearly $50,000
_ a small part of Bush's overall collections, however _ during the
three months preceding the governor's summer campaign finance
report.
</P>
<P>
   And cigarette companies also are spreading the warning: If our
legal industry can be targeted by the government today, yours can
be tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   That warning didn't work in Texas, where the governor didn't
have any control over an independently elected, anti-tobacco
attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   How it might play in Washington, were Bush to find himself in
the White House and in control of the Department of Justice,
remains to be seen.

WHERE'S THE BEEF IN CLINTON-GIULIANI RACE? 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HARRY ROSENFELD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The upcoming race between Hillary Rodham Clinton
and Rudolph Giuliani to represent New York in the U.S. Senate is
attracting as much interest outside New York as in.
</P>
<P>
   Even before either the first lady or the mayor of New York has
formally declared as a candidate, people want to know, with a
passion surpassing interest in any other race, including the
presidency, just who is going to win.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't only New Yorkers asking this question. It was posed
wherever I traveled outside the state the last couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls taken regularly about aspects of the
upcoming clash feed the appetite for wanting to discern the winner
long before the one poll that counts: Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   All of which contributes to the much-criticized emphasis by the
news media on the horse race aspect of elections. The argument has
been tirelessly urged on the public that newspapers, magazines and
radio and television focus on who's ahead and shunt aside the
exploration of how the candidates stand on issues that matter.
</P>
<P>
   A recent guest appearance on a radio program in Albany provided
me and opportunity to hear the dynamics of this argument. The host
of the program, Fred Dicker, presented the findings of not one, but
two, public opinion surveys, whose directors he interviewed over
the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Mickey Carroll of the Quinnipiac College poll found the
candidates tied, as they had been for a while. The other, Lee
Miringoff of the Marist College poll, had Giuliani with a
substantial lead.
</P>
<P>
   When Miringoff was questioned about whether his extensive
polling so early in the game did not encourage the very behavior of
the media that has been so much decried, some informative answers
emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Dicker jumped in with his view that the news media feed on polls
because they are sustenance, they give reporters something to write
about. As those in the news business will have to admit, Dicker
squarely hit the target. The news media are not merely the toy of
forces larger themselves, forced by an insatiable public to focus
on the horse race. Even absent such demand, there is the need for
the news media every day to ``feed the goat.'' As you know, a goat
will eat any rusted tin can that comes along.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Miringoff argued that continued polling, even in
the preliminary stages of the Clinton-Giuliani face-off, was
helping to keep the reporting honest.
</P>
<P>
   For example, by measuring the public reaction to President
Clinton's clemency for the imprisoned Puerto Rican militants, and
the first lady's reaction to it, journalists could not with
impunity make claims contrary to poll findings that it had been
negligible.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, politicians themselves poll extensively. However
much the political insiders help to stir up criticism of media
political coverage because of the horse race emphasis, politicians
constantly poll to learn where their campaign is strong and where
it needs bolstering.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, only favorable findings from these polls will be made
public. Consequently, the public itself has a compelling use for
polling data that are not politically manipulated by the interested
parties.
</P>
<P>
   If the choice were between knowing and not knowing, between
asking too many questions too often and not asking them at all, a
free society is better served by the activism than passivism. That
does not hide the downside. Too much of a supposed good thing helps
overload the public with trivial information. Likely this
overloading dissuades even more people from taking an active
interest in electoral politics.
</P>
<P>
   At their best, all polls are no more than a snapshot of the
moment and the context in which they are asked. Opinions can shift
as quickly as the stock market rises and falls.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton-Giuliani right now is the hottest contest going, because
of its national implications for both Democrats and Republicans. It
is easy to understand why so many people want to know what will
happen in that race. But as it progresses, the need to move beyond
the matter of whose nose is closer to the finish line will become
clearer. After the up and downsides of their personalities, there
looms the more relevant concerns of what kind of policies each
would advocate in office.

MOVIES RECENTLY REVIEWED IN THE BOSTON GLOBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   !!! ``The Acid House'' It's another romp through Scotland's
lower depths from the brain of Irvine (``Trainspotting'') Welsh,
who adapted three of his surreal short stories for the screen.
There is black humor aplenty: One poor sod gets turned into a fly
by God, another's on acid and (via a lightning storm) inhabits the
mind of a newborn boy. But there are also some harrowingly bleak
situations and dead-end lives on display. (Unrated) (Jim Sullivan) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! ``Black Cat, White Cat'' Emir Kusturica's rollicking comic
opera for the eyes rides a nonstop soundtrack and the irrepressibly
larcenous instincts of its Gypsy families victimizing one another
with cheerful gusto on the banks of the Danube. Srdan Todorovic's
sawed-off little coke-sniffing crimelord and Sabri Sulejman's
godfather, toothily reminding him who's boss, stand out in a cast
where nobody lets down. (Unrated) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! ``Dog Park'' A romantic comedy with an adult sensibility,
directed by Bruce McCulloch of the comic ensemble Kids in the Hall.
Luke Wilson and Natasha Henstridge are the lead couple, Janeane
Garofalo and McCulloch the perfect couple who may not be so
perfect. Everybody sees the same canine shrink, and doggie behavior
is the catalyst for the all too human behavior that keeps the plot
in engaging motion. (R) (Jim Sullivan) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! 1/2 ``Double Jeopardy'' Ashley Judd is a strong presence in this
revenge thriller about a wife convicted of her husband's murder,
paroled, and out for blood when she learns he's still alive and had
set her up. But none of the rest of this lukewarm outing measures
up to her. Tommy Lee Jones, as a lawman pursuing her after she
breaks parole, and Bruce Greenwood, as her conniving spouse, are
flat. Judd's at her best when she cleverly plays connect-the-dots
with a computer to track hubby down. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! ``Jakob the Liar'' This film about a Warsaw ghetto Jew who
buoys his neighbors' hopes and risks his life by inventing
optimistic news bulletins from a radio he doesn't have finds Robin
Williams in good form. Anybody worried that he'd do a
Patch-Adams-in-the-ghetto routine needn't. The film, directed by
Holocaust survivor Peter Kassovitz, earns its affirmations
honorably and with more fullness and edge than the German-language
film of the same novel made in 1974. (PG-13) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! ``The Minus Man'' Hampton Francher makes an auspicious
directing debut and Owen Wilson advances his career in this laconic
take on a bland serial killer able to pass unnoticed in a small
California town. The inhabitants are basically as aberrant as he
is, especially Brian Cox's unhappy landlord in the market for a
surrogate son and getting more than he bargained for in this wicked
little black comedy. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! ``Mumford'' Writer-director Lawrence Kasdan's pleasurable
ensemble piece is a throwback to the '30s and '40s in its
celebration of common-sense virtues and small-town eccentricities.
The story is set in motion when Loren Dean's new therapist in town
starts piling up such a high success rate that you know he's too
good to be true. Not that the locals _ led by Hope Davis, Mary
McDonnell, Jason Lee, and Pruitt Taylor Vincent _ are complaining.
(R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! 1/2 ``On the Ropes'' This documentary tells a familiar tale of
young boxers in Brooklyn using their skills to escape lives
pockmarked by drugs, crime, and despair. Filmmakers Nanette
Burstein and Brett Morgen improve on a well-worn story by
concentrating not only on the fighters but on their trainer, Harry
Keitt, who hopes his young charges' success will also provide his
ticket to a better life. (Unrated) (Renee Graham) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! 1/2 ``Sugar Town'' Allison Anders and Kurt Voss draw a bead on a
bunch of aging rockers knocking around LA, trying to jump-start
their careers. They get flavorful performances from Michael Des
Barres, Ally Sheedy, Lucinda Janney, Rosanna Arquette, Jade Gordon,
and Beverly D'Angelo, among others, but this project came together
too quickly. Its unavoidably apparent haste and ramshackle
construction make you wish they had rewritten it one more time
before shooting. (R)

   But others see reason for enthusiasm. ``There is a risk of us
overselling the usefulness (of the genome), but one doesn't have to
do that, because it's going to be just terrific,'' said Victor
McKusick, the Johns Hopkins University biologist sometimes called
the father of genetic medicine. ``It's not going to come next year
or the year after that, but the coming century is going to be a
very exciting one of profiting from the available information from
the genome.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, information gleaned from the project has become a
valuable resource for thousands of medical researchers, including
many at Boston's hospitals and universities.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all big pharmaceutical companies have refocused their
drug-discovery processes around the new understanding of genes, and
some _ including Pfizer Inc., Amgen Inc., Bayer AG, and Merck &AMP; Co.
_ have set up shop in Boston or Cambridge or have plans to do so.
Together, the two cities are becoming known as ``Genetown.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 7,000 people are expected to visit Boston next March for a
biotechnology conference, making it the largest such conference
ever held, according to the Massachusetts Biotechnology Council,
which will host the event.
</P>
<P>
   The new genetic knowledge is also expected to add to the state's
base of 25,000 biotechnology jobs. Not only are companies likely to
spend millions of dollars on using it to develop medical
treatments, but they will likely hire workers and spend money to
sequence the DNA of hundreds of other organisms for the clues they
give to how human genes work. Moreover, the human genome will be
mapped again and again to find the small but significant
differences in the genetic code that make individuals vary.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be big changes,'' predicts Jonathan
Rothberg, president of the New Haven, Conn. biotech company
CuraGen. ``The human variations we discover and the associations we
make between human genes and disease will be the basis of medicine
for the next century.''
</P>
<P>
   There are several private companies trying to catalog all human
genes. One of them, Celera Genomics Group of Rockville, Md., says
that it will use a different technique than the Human Genome
Project to sequence human DNA and that it will finish the job two
years before the government's final version is done. However,
unlike the Human Genome Project, Celera will charge others a fee to
see most of its data.
</P>
<P>
   William Haseltine, chairman and chief executive of Human Genome
Sciences Inc., also of Rockville, says his company has already
catalogued 95 percent of the medically useful human genes. Instead
of scanning the chemical sequence of DNA, Haseltine's company found
genes by looking for the telltale signs they leave when they are
active within cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Human Genome Project sequence is completed, it will
be a rather meaningless footnote to a revolution that is well under
way,'' Haseltine said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, pharmaceutical companies are using genetic
research to streamline the creation of new drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, developing new drugs was an expensive and tedious
process of trial and error, taking many years and costing hundreds
of millions of dollars. Often the drugs were discovered haphazardly
through their effects on patients who took them for other reasons.
In other cases, it required time-consuming testing of thousands of
compounds, one at a time, in animals, says Robert Tepper, chief
scientific officer of Millennium Pharmaceuticals in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Now, companies like Millennium are developing techniques for
testing thousands of drugs at the same time. Those drugs can be
washed across tiny ``gene chips'' that contain hundreds or
thousands of genes taken from cells of healthy or ill people. All
these interactions are analyzed by computers that quickly report
which drugs had the desired effect on the genes.
</P>
<P>
   A perfect example of the new approach came in an announcement
last week from scientists at the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge
and Millennium Pharmaceuticals. They said they had identified a new
target for obesity therapy, a protein in the small intestine that
regulates how much fat from food is taken up into the body. Having
found that protein and the gene that causes it to be made, the
researchers will try to find a drug that blocks that process,
reducing fat uptake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drugs . . . will be more selective and less toxic, much more
geared to a specific type of a disease that you have,'' said
Tepper. Beyond this, he said, ``we will be able to offer patients
many many more tests that will help them predict their risks and
change their lifestyles'' to help them avoid diseases to which they
are genetically predisposed.
</P>
<P>
   Another goal of the genome project is identifying genetic
variations that dictate differences in the way humans respond to
drugs. The same drug may help some people but not others, and in
still others cause harmful side effects.
</P>
<P>
   In the not-too-distant future, people might be given a DNA test
at birth and then issued a small card or computer chip that
indicates what type of health problems they are likely to
encounter. The hope is that they would be able to make lifestyle
decisions and perhaps take new preventive drugs to forestall those
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, though, predictive tests will arrive before
preventions, creating dilemmas for patients and doctors. ``We are
going to be going through hell, because we'll learn a lot about
biology and physiology'' but there won't be immediate treatments,
said Collins, the genome project coordinator at the National
Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest effect of the genome project could come in cancer
treatment, in which many patients routinely receive chemotherapy
and other painful therapies with no benefit. By studying genes,
researchers are finding that what they thought was a single type of
cancer is really a family of genetically distinct diseases, each of
which might require a different treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Already, doctors are checking the genetic signature of a tumor
before recommending treatment. Breast cancer patients who have an
overabundance of a gene called HER2 now are often given Herceptin,
which blocks the gene and prevents it from overproducing a protein
that prompts tumors to spread quickly. If HER2 is not overabundant,
the woman is not a candidate for Herceptin.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the work is aimed at finding new treatments for
cancer. If researchers could figure out which genes are involved,
they could fashion drugs, like Herceptin, to block a particular
gene or to spur a gene to become more active.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cancer has been a black box,,'' said Dr. Richard Klausner,
director of the National Cancer Institute. ``It's been hard to know
what's going on inside and how to fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   Studying the genes that cause cancer ``has been like switching
on the lights,'' Klausner said. ``It's that dramatic.''

REMEMBERING THE STORY BEHIND `JEKYLL &AMP; HYDE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ There's no arguing the success of ``Jekyll &AMP; Hyde,''
the musical that opens for a one-week run at the Wang Theatre on
Tuesday. It's broken the box-office record at Broadway's Plymouth
Theatre, and there's even a tribe of recidivists called
``Jekkies,'' some of whom have seen the show more than 300 times.
The soundtrack, featuring ``Someone Like You'' and ``This Is the
Moment,'' has sold more than 150,000 copies. In the Wang lobby,
fans can buy posters, CDs, T-shirts, and kitchen magnets. There's a
Web site (www.jekyll-hyde.com) where the latest news, CDs, and
links to cast members' home pages and fan clubs are available.
</P>
<P>
   Director David Warren believes he can explain the musical's
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``The audience doesn't have to work hard,'' says Warren, whose
previous direction includes revivals of ``Summer and Smoke'' (with
Mary McDonnell and Harry Hamlin) and ``Holiday'' (with Laura Linney
and Tony Goldwyn). ``I've been in audiences where they have to work
hard to enjoy something, as if they're taking their medicine after
being told they're experiencing an important piece of theater. In
this one, the response is effortless. And the score is great. The
score is really accessible to audiences. Also, the performers _ and
I know this sounds like a cliche, but it's not _ the performers
give 110 percent every night. Those are the three elements. The
score, the performers and . . .'' Warren pauses. ``Oh, and the
story.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's not forget about the story.
</P>
<P>
   A tubercular Robert Louis Stevenson, under the influence of a
series of dreams in an English beach house in Bournemouth, wrote
``The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde'' in a matter of a
few days in 1885.
</P>
<P>
   According to biographer James-Pope Hennessy, Stevenson awoke
from a nightmare and furiously began writing down the story of a
doctor and a personality-altering white powder. Several critics and
biographers have pointed out that Stevenson's illnesses, which left
him bed-ridden and weak, were also the impetus for his literary
fantasies. Biographer Frank McLynn writes, ``As always, when ill,
he pretended to be another person . . . showing clearly his need to
detach himself from this tubercular alien `thing' that occupied his
body, and pointing once again to the conclusion that the deep
springs of Jekyll and Hyde came from his illness.'' Three days
after the nightmare, Stevenson read a manuscript of nearly 40,000
words to his wife, Fanny, and her son from a previous marriage,
Lloyd Osbourne. Fanny objected to the story's ``sensationalism''
and a fiery fight ensued. However, after cooling off and
considering Fanny's objections, Stevenson tossed the story into the
fireplace and started over, this time emphasizing the more
allegorical aspects of the story. Three days later, he completed
his rewritten version. After six weeks of additional polishing,
``The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde'' was published in
London. It was an immediate hit, selling 40,000 copies in Britain
and about 250,000 in pirated editions in the United States,
according to McLynn.
</P>
<P>
   Five months later, an adaptation appeared as a stage show at
London's L. C. O'Toole's Theatre. Since then, innumerable
productions and movies have used the story of the good doctor and
his mad alter ego as both an allegory for their particular times
and to fill their theatrical coffers.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few decades, the story became a movie staple. John
Barrymore's 1920 version added bits of Oscar Wilde's ``The Picture
of Dorian Gray'' and several female characters. In 1922, F. W.
Murnau made ``Der Januskopf'' with Conrad Veidt. In 1931, Fredric
March won the Oscar for his performance in director Rouben
Mamoulian's version and, 10 years later, director Victor Fleming
gave us Spencer Tracy with Lana Turner and Ingrid Bergman. Tracy
didn't win an Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, there have been Jerry Lewis and Eddie Murphy as
nutty professors and ``Abbott and Costello Meet Dr. Jekyll and Mr.
Hyde'' in comedy adaptations and ``Dr. Jekyll and Ms. Hyde,'' the
gender-bending version, and Julia Roberts in the title role of
``Mary Reilly,'' or Dr. Jekyll as seen by the maid. Jack Palance
won an Emmy for hamming it up in a TV version and, in what must be
the most outrageous musical version, Kirk Douglas sings and dances
in a 1975 British TV movie. Dr. Jekyll has even been played by the
John Gielgud of canines, Wishbone, in an episode called ``Mixed
Breed.'' And that's just the surface of the interpretive and
commercial windfall that Jekyll and Hyde has become. Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something powerful and mythic about a story of split
identity,'' says Warren. ``All cultures have these myths and folk
tales and the universal and lasting appeal of `Jekyll &AMP; Hyde' keeps
striking a chord in ours. We all have good and evil. We're so
afraid of the evil inside us that we're afraid to embrace _ and,
thus, control _ it. Every time the story's been retold there's a
twist added. In our version, Hyde is seductive. It deals with evil
in an attractive package. Hyde isn't an overt monster; he's a
seductive sexual predator.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren pauses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like that murderer Robert Chambers who killed those women
in New York,'' he says. ``He used his charm. Evil charm.''
</P>
<P>
   In previous incarnations, Barrymore played Hyde as a drug
addict; there were explosions of sexual tension in March and
Tracy's portrayals; and the Hammer Film version, ``The Two Faces of
Dr. Jekyll,'' made Hyde the more attractive figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many interpretations,'' says Warren, ``because
the story is so open to so much. Drug abuse. Alcoholism. Sexual
identity. Schizophrenia. That's why the movies and plays have been
so successful.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nabokov's dissent
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not according to some. Vladimir Nabokov, in a piece collected in
``Lectures on Literature,'' advised his Cornell students to
``ignore the fact that ham actors under the direction of pork
packers have acted in a parody of the book, which parody was then
photographed on a film and showed in places called theaters; it
seems to me that to call a movie house a theater is the same as to
call an undertaker a mortician.''
</P>
<P>
   In most cases it's bad business to speculate on what a dead
author might think of the post-mortem reaction to his work. But not
in the case of Robert Louis Stevenson. It's easy to imagine that if
Stevenson came back to see the musical ``Jekyll &AMP; Hyde'' or any of
the movies and TV shows, he wouldn't recognize it as his own. The
original story is structurally founded on two letters left by the
late Dr. Jekyll, who, if we are to believe Stevenson, was a rather
corpulent fellow _ a far cry from the matinee movie and theater
idols who have played him.
</P>
<P>
   And Stevenson would most likely resent seeing his story enacted
in a theater. In March 1885, he wrote to his dramaturgical
collaborator, William Henley, ``I have come unhesitatingly to the
opinion that the stage is only a lottery. . . . It is bad enough to
live by an art, but to think to live by an art combined with
commercial speculation _ that way madness lies.''

APATHY EMPOWERS MILOSEVIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE _ The nightly demonstrations began last week against
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. But, as it turned out, there
was little reason for him to be displeased.
</P>
<P>
   The protests started with crowds smaller than rallies held last
month, and then continued to shrink even more.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic seems secure. Even opposition leaders acknowledge that
their efforts are not likely to topple him. If that is to happen,
it would probably come from some unseen hand orchestrating a palace
coup _ and no one considers that a sure bet.
</P>
<P>
   So why is Milosevic _ who has lost four wars in a row and
oversees a devastated economy _ still so secure?
</P>
<P>
   It could be that his control of the Army and police, combined
with a weak opposition, keeps threats at bay. But ordinary Serbians
say another reason for Milosevic's staying power is their own
apathy, which springs from their sense of powerlessness.
</P>
<P>
   The sense of confused hopelessness has, for many, only increased
after the North American Treaty Organization's 11-week bombing
campaign that ended three months ago; they feel surrounded by
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like mad scientists are conducting experiments on our
country,'' said Srdjan Gojikovic-Gile, 38, leader of the longtime
Yugoslav band Electricni Orgazam, sitting in a
houseboat-turned-restaurant nicknamed Brodich, or Shippy, on the
Sava River.
</P>
<P>
   Here, on one recent night, an artist, a theology professor with
a military-style haircut, a fireman, an importer, and an off-duty
female soldier sat or stood around a table. They drank Serbian
beer. They laughed at each other's jokes, and they talked about
everything but politics.
</P>
<P>
   The subject wasn't avoided out of fear or ignorance _ these
people have keen political instincts _ but because the boat was a
place to escape the realities of their lives. And so the
conversation ranged from the pleasures of reading the postmodernist
philosopher Jean Baudrillard to the rantings of the chain-smoking
cook who wanted to serve only eggplant.
</P>
<P>
   The avoidance of politics is fed by the madness that has invaded
every aspect of life in Serbia, Gile explained later. For instance,
he said, pro-government parties were using at their rallies one of
his songs, ``The Whole Yugoslavia is Dancing to Rock 'n' Roll,''
while opposition rallies were using another one of his songs,
``It's Time for Action, Time for Change.''
</P>
<P>
   And if that wasn't crazy enough, he said, the choice of the song
stolen by the pro-government forces was truly bizarre. ``A big part
of (the song) is about being on an LSD trip,'' Gile said, laughing
as he sang a line:
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's pick up the colors, which are falling from the sky.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are living in a country that only Kafka could create in his
imagination,'' he said. ``We are in a prison colony. I think all
countries are like prisons in a way, but here in Serbia we live in
solitary confinement.''
</P>
<P>
   North of Belgrade, in the picturesque town of Pancevo, Sasa
Rakezic, 36, an artist, said the uncertainty has caused many people
to become sluggish and descend into depression.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Rakezic, who draws comic strips under the pen name of
Aleksandar Zograf, said there also was an air of anticipation
around the country. He recently traveled to Budapest, and for a
while became seduced by the simple ease of life there. Then he
returned to Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, I had some sort of feeling that there was
some drama going on here,'' said Rakezic. ``I felt I didn't want to
miss it, whatever it is, even if it hurts me.''
</P>
<P>
   In Serbia, perhaps drama is the only certainty left.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the nightly street demonstrations will continue into the
winter. Perhaps the electrical grids, heavily damaged by NATO's
graphite bombs, will collapse when demand rises in cold weather.
Perhaps early elections will be called. Perhaps Milosevic will
emerge even stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic is clever, very clever,'' said a longtime diplomat
in Belgrade in a hushed tone, leaning over his coffee in a hotel
lobby that is a favorite of wealthy smugglers. ``Milosevic must
feel as if he were in a cage, and that makes this a most dangerous
time, a disorienting time _ for him and for everyone here.''

JUMP-STARTING PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like any good, would-be synthesizer, Senator John Kerry has a
solid understanding of the opposites he seeks to attract in trying
to help public schools change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous,'' he observes, correctly. ``Congress is
dillying and dallying at the fringes of this with code words. It
happens on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   From the right that means the robotic cry of ``Vouchers.''
</P>
<P>
   But from the Democratic world, that means _ in addition to the
necessary opposition to ideas that literally rob Peter to pay Paul
_ a constant refrain about reducing the size of classes and helping
fund the repair and construction of school buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Back when Kerry first decided to dive into an effort to forge
consensus, he had a message for his own party that he has never
dropped. As he put it in an address at Northeastern University back
in mid-1998:
</P>
<P>
   ``To my fellow Democrats, let me say simply if we don't come up
with real answers for what ails our schools, then our defense on
public schools will become the defeat of the public schools. We
can't afford to be uncritical apologists for public schools that
work for our bureaucrats but not for our kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Last December, he put together a vehicle for change and joined
with a Republican freshman with an interest in working across the
aisle _ Senator Gordon Smith of Oregon _ to promote it. Since then,
support has steadily expanded, thanks to the work of the
new-thinking Democratic Ledership Council and a growing chorus of
Republican moderates.
</P>
<P>
   And now, it's crunch time.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Congress is a dysfunctional mess. But it has to forge
some kind of budget agreement with President Clinton before it can
get out of town for the year in about a month. And the president,
Kerry reports and White House officials confirm, is committed to
pressing for a downpayment on the Kerry-Smith reform program.
Within a responsible budget policy, there is no reason that $5
billion to $8 billion can't be found to begin a five-year effort.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans and Democrats can still battle over the
reauthorization of the government's basic elementary and secondary
school programs next year. But reform needs to start now, and it
can.
</P>
<P>
   As he explained it over breakfast last week and then in a speech
to a DLC forum here, the guiding principle of the plan is the
support of communities that have made the commitment to change.
</P>
<P>
   All but four or five states have made some kind of specific
commitment, 39 of them using the standards of the Goals 2000 effort
begun a decade ago under President Bush (but curiously ignored by
his voucher-fixated son).
</P>
<P>
   It would be, Kerry said, a system of positive reinforcement. The
great irony is that there is no mystery about the components of
reform and considerable consensus about ideas that can make a
difference.
</P>
<P>
   The laundry list should be familiar: very specific goals for
educational improvement, the ability to change school officials and
teachers who aren't meeting standards, after-school programs and
longer school days and years, more charter schools and real
parental choice within the public school system, character
education, discipline codes and second-chance schools for problem
kids, and strong links with local businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The systems that make these reform commitments will get the aid
and continue to get it as long as they meet those commitments.
Simple as that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to acknowledge that the system that isn't
producing now is essentially a system designed for the people who
work in it, not for the kids it's supposed to educate,'' Kerry told
me.
</P>
<P>
   Tough language, but more descriptive than pejorative.
</P>
<P>
   In selling and shaping what became Kerry-Smith, the Democratic
Leadership Council's president, Al From, has been a critical ally.
A product of the public schools of the '50s in South Bend, Ind.,
with a healthy nostalgia for public school as part of a community's
shared experience, From is operating the party's most important
idea factory by far.
</P>
<P>
   The DLC's origin 15 years was marked by left-right fights as
Democrats struggled to come back from their multiple defeats from
the late '60s on, but today it is a unifying and innovate force.
And From has always had the ear of former DLC chairman Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The mechanism to jump-start public school reform seems odd on
the surface. But shoe-horning it into a budget deal at the end of
this congressional session is in fact brilliant tactics in the face
of Congress' overall gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to break out of the ideological bind we've put
ourselves in,'' Kerry told the DLC last week.
</P>
<P>
   He just might pull it off.

GROWING INTO HEDWIG'S INCHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The evening starts with a vivacious, tarted-up blond woman
goose-stepping down the aisle, taking the stage. This woman, named
Hedwig Schmidt, explains that she was once a young German boy who
grew up in East Berlin transfixed by American rock 'n' roll, which
he listened to on the radio with his head in the oven, for
privacy's sake. He yearned to be a girl; later he went under the
knife and became that girl, albeit a girl with ``an angry inch'' of
scar tissue remaining between her legs. She and her lover, an
American GI, married and moved to America, but once there, he left
her. She ended up in a Kansas trailer park where she befriended a
rock singer, Tommy Speck, whom she helped groom into a an
egotistical rock star named who called himself Tommy Gnosis. He
left her, too.
</P>
<P>
   And now, up on stage, she is a wisecracking, self-deprecating
cabaret singer, singing her tragi-comic tale for us, a
self-described ``girly-boy who became the internationally ignored
song-stylist barely standing here.'' With a full-tilt rock 'n' roll
band willing to crank away at a moment's notice.
</P>
<P>
   Does this sound like a mainstream hit to you?
</P>
<P>
   ``It is certainly surprising,'' says John Cameron Mitchell, the
director, star, and co-creator of ``Hedwig and the Angry Inch.'' It
became an off-off Broadway hit last year and this in New York at
the Jane Theater, garnering a heap of praise from the rock and
theater press, and it opens in Boston at the 57 Theatre Tuesday
night, running at least through Halloween. Musician-actor-celebs
like David Bowie and Madonna have gone and dug it. The buzz keeps
humming right along: This is one rock musical done right.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is universal in a way I did not expect,'' Mitchell says, on
the telephone from New York, ``but I think the more specific you
are, the more universal you will be. Hollywood operates on the
opposite assumption, which is the broader and more homogeneous you
are'' the more successful you'll be _ that ``the lowest common
denominator equals universal. But you just don't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   The process of creating ``Hedwig,'' a collaboration between
Mitchell and guitarist-songwriter Stephen Trask of the New York
band Cheater, began in 1994. ``I wanted to write something that was
truly rock 'n' roll and truly theater,'' says Mitchell, 36. ``I was
a fan of both and thought they were never fully integrated without
diluting one or the other. I started looking for a composer who
came from the rock world. Then Steve and I met by accident on a
plane, met again through some friends, I went to see his band, he
saw me in a show, and he said that he wanted to write something for
me. And I said, `Well, as a matter of fact there is something I was
starting to write.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Says Trask: ``If there was a mission, it was to be the first
rock musical that truly rocked. It was to make actual legitimate
contemporary-sounding rock music that worked dramatically. It
needed to be intimate, accessible, and have depth. . . . I always
had confidence that in some form these songs could be this
successful, but I didn't know what context that would be.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The main way of keeping the rock uncorrupted,'' picks up
Mitchell, ``was to have the band on stage, make it like a rock gig
_ a play in the form of a rock gig. The key was not just making a
collection of songs, but integrating it into a story so that the
themes and metaphors were extended correctly.''
</P>
<P>
   Trask's band Cheater became Hedwig's band the Angry Inch for the
initial New York run. The group has now broken up (Hedwig took over
its identity and, along with poor management, helped caused its
demise, Trask says). Trask was in Boston two weeks ago working with
the hand-picked band he chose for this show. On board is Arlan
Feiles (keyboards/guitar/vocals), Perry Jay (drums, formerly of Big
Catholic Guilt and Rasputina), David P. Meyer (bass), and Jan
Tilley (guitar/vocals, formerly of Rude Girls and Ronnie Spector).
Feiles, Jay, and Meyer attended Berklee College of Music.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only regret is they are not playing my songs,'' Trask says.
``They are so good, with a wonderful personality, tight without
being robotic, expressive _ we've changed arrangements around with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   As good as Cheater was?
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the minimum _ at least equal.''
</P>
<P>
   There are four versions of ``Hedwig'' in production: in Boston,
Los Angeles, Germany, and New York (where Ally Sheedy has stepped
into the lead role, with Donovan Leitch, the son of the '60s
folksinger, to follow). In the spring, Mitchell begins work on a
film of ``Hedwig and the Angry Inch,'' with a six-week shoot. It
will leave the confines of the stage. Mitchell, who will direct and
star, is aiming for something along the lines of ``Nashville'' or
``All That Jazz.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Off color and offstage &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell's play, which he calls ``sad-funny,'' is, among other
things, about the search for love, for one's other half. There is a
good deal of pathos in it, which does not, says Mitchell ``preclude
a filthy joke or two.'' Hedwig is forever breaking through the
mythical ``fourth wall'' and confronting the audience, sometimes
landing in someone's lap or following a patron into the restroom.
Randy double-entendres and in-jokes are scattered liberally, but
``Hedwig'' is not so insider-ish that it befuddles its audience
with its hipster quotient.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never wanted it to be exclusive,'' says Mitchell. ``I think
some drag, some rock, some theater does feel safer in excluding
people from your little in-jokes us-vs.-them situations. I tried
not to dumb it down or G-rate it, but at the same time I tried to
include everyone in the story-telling environment.''
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Mitchell says, he doesn't think of it as a drag
show. Rather, he says, ``I think of it more as a character using
drag. I watched a lot of drag queens at (the New York club) Squeeze
Box before I did it, and it is not pushed to where Squeeze Box was,
which was a full-drag rock 'n' roll club. . . . I never thought of
it as a gay story either. It was much more about: What am I?''
</P>
<P>
   Trask labored long and hard over the 10 songs. He had role
models for certain songs _ think of Patti Smith, the B-52's, and
Iggy Pop for the title number _ and he knew his task was to write
songs that would click upon first hearing. ``I wanted to have a
combination of that quirky '70s punk thing, but also had to be able
to incorporate a spoken word of some sort.'' For ``Exquisite
Corpse'' and ``Wicked Little Town,'' Trask says he researched Dada
and surrealism, for which he wrote lyrics about found objects and
rebuilding. ``There is that side,'' he says, ``but I wanted `Wicked
Little Town' to be a visceral moment and didn't want the audience
too bogged down in the narrative. I wanted it about feel, so the
song has a few purposes, the words to punch out in a non-linear
way, a barrage of words like `star, body, sewn-up' that you know
what they mean in the context of the play because we are that far
along enough. I also wanted to look at the way rock musicians get
`heavy' in a sophomoric kind of way and I wanted to allow myself to
be sophomoric in the writing at that point.''
</P>
<P>
   The closing song, ``Midnight Radio,'' is a dramatic, Bowie-esque
number that Trask calls ``a bittersweet triumph, a very emotional
song. That was about nine years of trudging around the clubs in New
York, carrying my equipment with duct tape and safety pins holding
it together, living with the electricity turned off, losing friends
to drugs and whatever, watching the scars that were left and also
watching the number of people who are still hanging on for the love
of music or rock 'n' roll culture. That is for me and my friends. I
started thinking about the way songs hit you at night'' when you're
alone ``and the whole night becomes still. A song shuts out the
whole world, but at the same time you are connected to it. And all
of a sudden, the song is over and you're left with the stillness of
the night. It was that image I tried to capture.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Rosie futures &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Trask, who says he is ``comfortably middle class for the
first time in my life,'' the play opened doors, some of them pretty
strange. Rosie O'Donnell's people rang up to say Jenna Elfman
wanted to perform ``Wig in a Box'' on her show. Trask is on his way
to join the LA version of the Angry Inch _ which happens to be
Stone Temple Pilots minus jailed singer Scott Weiland _ for a
performance celebrating the soundtrack's release on Atlantic. He
says he was on the verge of giving up making commercial music and
following his boyfriend, an academic, to New Haven and was going to
``build it out from there, working on a smaller, more workable
scale. This has derailed that plan, but I am about to sign a
contract to produce another band who is going to record some of my
songs.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell says he plans to step back into the Hedwig role before
the movie starts shooting to hone his chops. ``I've been very
lucky,'' he says, ``because I have made a living as an actor since
college _ I've never had to take another job _ but there was a
point after `Hedwig' where I felt that I was not going to act for a
few years. I feel I passed the test and I just want to write and
direct for a while. But the (`Hedwig') movie will be my life for
about a year. I was at Sundance this summer working in the
filmmakers' lab and it was like being in high school.''
</P>
<P>
   Before fame came calling, Mitchell was ``a normal actor for 15
years, doing a lot of TV, teen movies, and trashy movies'' as well
as working on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' Mitchell continues, ``I feel (`Hedwig') is a
little suffocating, like I really needed to move on to another
project. But I have some friends who became TV stars and did not
quite trust their success because it was not based on something in
their mind that was good. I have no problem saying that we earned
this, so it feels fine. At times it feels like I need to get out of
it and it is too overwhelming _ too many mouths to feed in the
`Hedwig' world _ but other times, my paternal side comes out and I
do want to make sure the understudy is happy and tend to
everyone.''

A GREAT WALL 
Six Presidents and China: An Investigative History 
By Patrick Tyler 
PublicAffairs, 476 pp., illustrated, $27.50 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a risk of war between the United States and the
People's Republic of China over the issue of Taiwan, maintains
Patrick Tyler in the attention-grabbing prologue to his study of
US-Sino relations. And, he adds as if to hammer home the point,
``it is no longer alarmist to say so.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyler makes only a circumstantial case for his claim _ and even
manages to undercut it with an on-the-other-hand comment that there
are ``constant'' back-channel communications between Chinese and
Taiwanese leaders ``from which Americans are excluded.''
Nonetheless, he has provided, in ``A Great Wall,'' an account of
political blunders and Beltway infighting that suggests that
America could all too heedlessly stumble into the conflict he
foresees.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler is a former New York Times bureau chief in Beijing. But
unlike other journalists who have returned from exotic postings and
emptied their notebooks into what-I-saw-over-there books, he has
tried to find out what was going on back home while he was away.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Great Wall'' is based on fresh interviews with the men who
shaped _ or misshaped _ America's China policy over the past 30
years and on a study of newly declassified documents from the White
House, the State Department, and the CIA. And Tyler is a good
enough journalist to turn what could be a ponderous slog through
American diplomatic history into a riveting and endlessly
fascinating story, one that comes complete with heroes and
villains.
</P>
<P>
   And always in the background is Taiwan _ ``where today,'' Tyler
writes, ``Taiwanese and American technicians are erecting the
foundations for a future war'' with China. That risk of war, he
writes, was ``most recently and startlingly apparent'' in March
1996 _ a crisis triggered by President Clinton's ``abrupt
decision'' 10 months earlier to allow Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui
to attend his class reunion at Cornell University. That event
turned out to be not the ``private visit'' Lee had promised, but
the occasion for a flag-waving speech proclaiming the sovereignty
of the nationalist Republic of China on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   China responded on the eve of Taiwan's presidential elections
with the test firings of surface-to-surface missiles into ``target
boxes'' just outside Taiwan's principal harbors. And what appears
to Tyler as the worst aspect of the crisis was that at no time over
the crisis weekend did Clinton or his advisers ``address the larger
question _ to what extent would America defend Taiwan.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his account, Tyler tracks other instances in which
American leaders were either unprepared or unwilling to address the
questions raised by by events in China _ or diplomatic feelers from
China's leaders.
</P>
<P>
   It begins, in Tyler's account, with President Nixon's failure to
give the Soviet Union ``a clear, unambiguous statement of US
opposition to a military attack on China'' in 1968. It continues
with the revelation of CIA involvement in Angola that scuttled an
understanding between President Ford and Deng Xiaoping for mutual
anti-Soviet action there. And on it goes with the CIA's
heavy-handed pursuit of weapons it thought China was shipping to
Iran on the container ship Yinhe.
</P>
<P>
   This lack of coherence marks even the successes, like the
normalization of relations in December 1978, which Tyler writes
came ``as a result of all-out civil war within the Carter
administration,'' between Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and
National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brezinski. Credit for the
success, in Tyler's view, belongs to Ambassador Leonard Woodcock,
an unlikely figure who emerges as one of Tyler's heroes.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes policy verged on farce, as when special envoy
Michael Armacost went to the White House before leaving on a secret
mission to Beijing as a prelude to Clinton's abandonment of his
hardline human rights policy. But rather than the expected
15-minute policy discussion with Clinton, Armacost gets a handshake
and a brief word or two _ because that morning Paula Jones had
filed her sexual harassment lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler's Washington-centric approach is at its best in his
account of the Bush administration's reaction to the Tiananmen
demonstrations _ a subject on which it might be thought that there
is litte new to report.
</P>
<P>
   As the crisis built, Tyler writes, ``all Washington could think
about was Mikhail Gorbachev,'' concerned that ``the coming
rapproachment between China and the Soviet Union did not come at
the expense of the United States.'' But in the background was the
hostility between the outgoing ambassador, Winston Lord, a
hardliner who is one of Tyler's villains, and the more
accomodationist Bush State Department. And at least partly because
of that hostility, when the military crackdown came, ``the Bush
administration was unprepared to deal with the horrific truth'' of
the assault on the demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Great Wall'' is so riveting an account of what was happening
in Washington that the reader is left with a sense of regret _ that
we are unlikely to get so riveting an inside account of what was
happening in the inner circles of Beijing.

SOME CONVENIENCE CHECKS ARE JUST BAIT FOR CREDIT-CARD TRAP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA WEN and BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We know credit-card companies are in business to make money, but
sometimes they just go too far.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the case of Geoffrey B. Rosenberg, the president of a
South Boston auto and truck parts business. He is bright,
articulate and savvy when it comes to money, but even he didn't see
what was coming with his A T &AMP; T Universal Card.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg, 40, decided to buy a set of bookcases for $2,800 and
wanted to make his money go as far as possible. So he bought the
bookcases with his GE MasterCard, earning card benefits with the
purchase. He then used an A T &AMP; T convenience check, which he had
received in the mail, to pay off the GE balance.
</P>
<P>
   Convenience checks are a popular marketing tool in the
credit-card industry, choking mail boxes across the country on a
daily basis. The checks usually are used for balance transfers from
another credit card, but often can be tapped for any purchase. They
typically carry a low teaser interest rate that remains in effect
for a limited period of time.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg's A T &AMP; T convenience check carried a 4.9 percent
interest rate until February, well below the card's regular rate of
16.7 percent. The pitch letter that accompanied the convenience
check called it a ``practical financial tool we think you'll enjoy
using.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg, who says he closely read all the fine print
accompanying the check, figured he would use it as a bridge. He
planned to pay off the convenience check balance entirely by
February, incurring relatively small interest charges.
</P>
<P>
   In early July, he made his first payment of $379, designating
that $73 should go to pay off the existing, higher-interest-rate
balance on his card with the remainder to go toward the balance on
the convenience check.
</P>
<P>
   But when he got his statement the following month, Rosenberg
discovered that just the opposite had been done. The bulk of his
$379 had been applied to the convenience check balance, and only a
minimum payment had been made on the existing card balance, which
had ballooned during the month because of additional purchases.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the credit-card company was maximizing its revenues,
getting rid of the convenience check balance with the lower
interest rate as fast as possible while making sure Rosenberg paid
the higher rate on his existing balance as long as possible. The
only way he could get rid of the existing balance was to pay off
the entire convenience check balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like this albatross that's going to hang around your neck
forever,'' Rosenberg said. ``If more people understood what game
was being run on them, they'd be much more careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg cried foul, but company officials referred him to the
fine print of his credit-card contract. It said: ``We may allocate
payments to amounts owed on your account in the manner we deem
appropriate, including but not limited to, applying payments to
promotional balances, such as balance transfers, before applying
them to purchases and cash advances.''
</P>
<P>
   Most other credit-card companies use similar language in their
contracts. Some, such as Fleet Bank of Boston, spell out the terms
right in the convenience check offer.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Mindler, a spokeswoman for Citibank, which owns the A T &AMP;
T card, said the company chooses to retire the convenience check
balances first because the teaser rate expires fairly quickly. She
said the company doesn't want customers to be hit with a major
interest-rate increase.
</P>
<P>
   The helpful, Big Brother attitude doesn't ring true to us. The
reason the banks allocate payments to the lower-interest-rate
balances first is because that approach makes them the most money.
</P>
<P>
   ``He found a credit trap and fell into it,'' said Edgar Dworsky,
a consumer advocate, commenting on Rosenberg's plight. Dworsky said
the only way around the trap is to pay off all existing balances
before using a convenience check.
</P>
<P>
   Unwilling to become the credit-card industry's latest victim,
Rosenberg used a home equity line of credit to pay off both A T &AMP; T
balances and secure extra money for home repairs.
</P>
<P>
   He then cut up his credit card and sent it back to A T &AMP; T, a
bit poorer but wiser. ``There are six ways to Sunday to play with
credit cards,'' he said, ``but there are also lots of ways to get
burned.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pitfalls of paying in advance
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More and more people pay for their funerals in advance, but some
recent cases in Massachusetts highlight some of the dangers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the Board of Registration in Funeral
Services suspended George Williams, who owns three funeral homes in
Arlington and Somerville, for five years for failing to honor
so-called preneed contracts clients had signed.
</P>
<P>
   In one of three instances cited by the board, a woman paid
$3,305 in 1991 to lock in prices for a casket, a burial plot at
Cambridge Cemetery and various funeral services. But when she died
in 1997, Williams allegedly took advantage of her brother's
unfamiliarity with the preneed contract to pad his pocket. He
convinced the brother a more expensive casket was needed, told him
another $1,400 was required to secure a burial plot at Cambridge
Cemetery and that more money was needed to pay for the funeral
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the suspension, the board ordered Williams to
notify all other clients with preneed contracts of his suspension
and allow them to transfer their contracts to other funeral homes.
Williams owns the Daniel F. O'Brien Funeral Home in Somerville and
the Berglund-Williams and the Berglund-Williams O'Brien Funeral
Homes in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate case, the board suspended the license of Toni L.
Bullock and shut down her Mattapan funeral home for failing to keep
adequate records of preneed contracts. Now her clients face the
task of trying to get their money back.
</P>
<P>
   Byron Blanchard, an official with the Memorial Society of
Boston, a consumer group, said the board's rare disciplinary
actions were a positive sign. But he said the cases illustrate the
risks of paying for funerals in advance. He noted the state has no
fund to guarantee preneed contracts and only one inspector to
watchdog its 700 funeral homes.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Carlson, in a book on how to make funeral arrangements,
said preneed contracts are great in concept but often not so good
in reality. ``It always pays to plan ahead, but it rarely pays to
pay ahead,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --A big plus of credit cards. After hearing a $1,000 refund tale
from a reader, we're reminded of the wisdom of using a credit card
for major purchases if possible. This past summer, a consumer tried
to return a $1,000 portable air conditioner when it failed to cool
down a room as promised. The unit was charged on his MasterCard.
The merchant balked at a full refund, but later issued a refund
minus a 20 percent (or $200) restocking fee. Still upset, our
reader wrote to MasterCard and invoked the federal government's
Regulation Z. This regulation (the details of which are on the back
of your credit-card statements) enables customers to withhold
payment if they believe a billing error has occurred or if they
dispute the quality of the goods or services received. The
credit-card issuer then investigates. In this case, MasterCard
ruled the Brookline man didn't have to pay the $200.
</P>
<P>
   --Spam clarification. After our column on ways to reduce junk
e-mail, also known as spam, a reader said we should have pointed
out that an Internet service provider can be unwittingly used, or
hijacked, by someone in a spamming scheme. He is right. The codes
in the e-mail message may reveal the spammer's ISP, but also may
indicate the name of an ISP that was an innocent intermediary in
delivering the message.

LAST CALL FOR MORSE, BUT NEVER FOR HIS GENRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBIN W. WINKS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OXFORD, England _ I was having a double vodka and lime at the
White Hart when the word ran through the pub like a bad best bitter
that Inspector Morse was dead. The back room was crowded with
youngish types right out of ``ER,'' maybe because the John
Radcliffe Hospital is just along the road, but calm as they might
all be during their emergency routines, there was a confusion of
rumor that no one could sort out: Morse had been struck down by a
maddened Sergeant Lewis, deranged at last when the skinflint chief
inspector had left him for the hundredth time with the bar tab.
Soon after we had the true word off the telly: Morse had died in a
diabetic coma while in the hospital, the victim of too much drink.
</P>
<P>
   Mystery and detective fiction is alive and well in Britain when
the death of a fictional Thames Valley copper, however beloved he
might be, is the subject of headlines across the land and
breathless television reports. Some pretty dirty journalism _
though for Britain, land of the dirtiest journalism this side of
Djakarta, perhaps not so dirty at that _ on the part of the Daily
Telegraph, a paper with a distinctly conservative bent, had
revealed the ending of author Colin Dexter's 13th, and definitively
last, Inspector Morse mystery.
</P>
<P>
   John Thaw, who has played the morose Morse in far more than 13
made-for-television mystery films (Dexter having written scripts
from scratch, or having adapted some inferior short stories to feed
the demand for more of the lushly decadent Oxford-based films),
professed himself to be very angry and condemned the Telegraph as
spiteful, while Colin Dexter looked on, no doubt a bit pleased with
the extra publicity for ``The Remorseful Day,'' but mainly, if we
are to believe him, happy to have all the killings stop. The crime
rate in Oxford has been enormous since the day in 1975 when Morse
more-or-less muddled his way through to a solution in the debut
novel, ``The Last Bus to Woodstock,'' the dead totaling, depending
on which newspaper one reads, between 77 and 80, and including
three heads of houses, or college masters.
</P>
<P>
   It is rare but not unknown for a writer to grow tired of his or
her own creation and try to put an end to it all. Sir Arthur Conan
Doyle famously tried to be rid of Sherlock Holmes, sending him to
his death (it was widely assumed) over the Raichenbach Falls, and
then had to rethink himself as his fans raged, and bring the
masterful Holmes back from the precipice and a period of quiet bee
farming. Nicolas Freeling gunned down his Dutch detective, Van der
Valk, without any foreshadowing and has never been as popular
since. Hercule Poirot died in Agatha Christie's ``Curtain,'' but
she had the wisdom, or guile, to hold the book back until after her
death. Many readers, I among them, felt that John D. MacDonald was
one book away from killing his Travis McGee, for ``Pale Grey for
Guilt'' betrayed a man no longer able to respond quickly to all of
Florida's mean challenges, but MacDonald died first.
</P>
<P>
   Why should Colin Dexter not have some freedom at last, able to
put on the shelf the satisfaction of having created a most
remarkable, infuriating, and appealing member of the fictional
police fraternity, the ``melancholy, sensitive, vulnerable,
independent, ungracious, mean-pocketed Morse,'' as Dexter himself
described him? The Inspector Morse tours of Oxford, many of them
run by enterprising undergraduates; the use of Morse novels in
courses on the detective story, to illustrate just how intriguing a
clue-laden plot can still be in these post-Christie and Sayers
days; and reruns of the uneven Morse films, which at their best
were seldom equaled and never exceeded on PBS's ``Mystery'' series;
all of this will continue.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, anyone who read the penultimate Inspector Morse
novel, ``Death Is Now My Neighbor,'' could see the remorseful day
coming. Morse is drinking too much, boozing by 10:30 in the
morning, often having three pints of Bass, and clearly suffering
from either prostate cancer or diabetes midway into the novel. Most
of the reviewers appeared to have missed the significance of the
title Dexter gave this novel, and to have been drawn off by the red
herring of the discovery of Morse's first name, which he had
succeeded in keeping even from his ever-patient sidekick Lewis for
21 years (that name was, as any fan knows, Endeavour, Morse's
father having been enamored with the voyages of Captain James
Cook), but that Morse would not be around much longer was clear
enough to anyone who had read the entire series.
</P>
<P>
   I give nothing away here about ``The Remorseful Day,'' which all
can still read with great pleasure as a superb mystery, the
Telegraph having put the allegedly newsworthy item behind us, other
than to say that it is a triumphant if sad conclusion to the
series. In the end Sergeant Lewis visits his old friend and boss in
the mortuary and, bending down, puts his lips to Morse's forehead
and whispers two final words: ``Goodbye, sir.'' A commentator for
the self-important Guardian suggests this may be gay necrophilia.
Compared to this garbage, was the Telegraph's betrayal of Dexter so
bad?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the mystery is thriving in Old Blimey. The Independent has
just revealed that Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife have hung
a portrait of Baroness James of Holland Park at 10 Downing Street
and suggested this was a ``trendy'' thing to do. Perhaps; the
Baroness James is, of course, the writer P. D. James, the greatest
of all successors to Christie and Sayers. Here at the White Hart, I
raise a glass of Old Speckled Hen and walk down Ethelred Close,
where (it is said) King Ethelred the Unready had his royal hunting
lodge. There will always be an England where the mystery novel is
read.

STUDY SAYS BAY AREA'S VIBRANT ECONOMY FACES PERILS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GEORGE RAINE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A study released Monday said the robust economy
in the San Francisco Bay area is threatened by challenges that
could cripple the region's ability to sustain prosperity and
preserve the quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among the challenges is a lack of affordable housing for
the work force and escalating traffic congestion, according to the
report, ``The Bay Area: Winning in the New Global Economy.'' The
report, issued Monday by the Bay Area Economic Forum and the Bay
Area Council, said the region's continued economic prosperity and
its national and global competitiveness are not guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will depend on the vision and vigilance of its civic
leaders,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, prepared by consultants at McKinsey &AMP; Co. in San
Francisco, working with the sponsors, show that the Bay Area has
completed ``a remarkable transformation from an industrial and
defense-heavy economy to a predominantly knowledge-based economy
that is the most productive in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The report found that productivity ranks first among seven
regions with which the San Francisco area was compared in computers
and electronics, bioscience, telecommunications, multimedia and
environmental technology. The cites used for comparison were
Boston, Charlotte, N.C., Houston, Los Angeles, New York, Phoenix
and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the Bay Area also have the nation's highest
personal income, at $38,300 per capita, an improvement over 1995
when the area was second to New York. Today, New York's per capita
income is $35,900.
</P>
<P>
   The study says the area's cycle of economic prosperity is
possible, ultimately, because the region offers unique
opportunities. Its companies attract skilled workers who benefit
from the economic potential the region presents and these workers
are critical to economic success, the study notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future success of the Bay Area hinges on its ability to
continue attracting highly talented entrepreneurs and skilled
workers with business and employment opportunities, high quality of
life and innovation infrastructure,'' the report says.
</P>
<P>
   ``But these entrepreneurs and skilled workers will locate and
remain in the Bay Area only if the value of this opportunity is
affordable. The Bay Area could fall victim to its own prosperity if
rising incomes and prices set in motion a worsening inflationary
spiral,'' it says.
</P>
<P>
   It adds that the area's advantage over the other regions in
productivity is being eroded by the cost of doing business,
especially the increasing cost of living experienced by the work
force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any other city in the country or the world would love to be in
the position the Bay Area is right now,'' said Sean Randolph,
president of the Bay Area Economic Forum. ``The negatives are not
by themselves from our successes or our prosperity. Housing has not
met the new job creation and population growth, but that is not the
fault of the economy. That is the fault of policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also found that transportation, which residents
routinely rank as their top concern, is not keeping pace with
growth. It rated the Bay Area 47th out of 350 locations in overall
transportation quality.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW RELEASES: ``The Mummy'' (DVD) _ This is a bad movie but a
great DVD. Forget all the silliness of Brendan Fraser's
Egyptological mumbo-jumbo and head straight for the ``Building a
Better Mummy'' documentary on the special effects wizardry. There's
also an archaeological archive that's very well done with sharp
graphics and helpful facts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet Frankenstein'' _ If parents can
stand the voices of the chattering chipmunks, the kids will
probably go for this unfrightening Frankenstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``The McCourts of New York'' _ Frank and Malachy McCourt, the
literary brothers, tell their tales in this marvelous story of
poverty made survivable through humor. Angela, their mother and the
title figure in Frank's best-seller, ``Angela's Ashes,'' might not
like the revelations, but that's what helps make the film so sharp
and true.

</P>
<P>
   COMING SOON ON DVD: ``The Unbearable Lightness of Being'' _
Philip Kaufman's magnificent interpretation of Milan Kundera's
brilliant novel comes stunningly alive in the DVD Criterion edition
of the 1988 film. Daniel Day-Lewis, Juliette Binoche, and Lena Olin
star in a love triangle set against the 1968 Soviet invasion of
Prague. As the title states, it's not that life is unbearably
heavy, but too light. On the commentary track _ Kaufman, Olin, and
screenwriter Jean-Claude Carriere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pink Floyd: The Wall'' _ Alan Parker's cult ode to the music
of Pink Floyd comes with everything imaginable in the DVD version.
Added footage and a transfer directly from the wide screen
interpositive make the rock epic look better than ever. Also, two
documentaries _ ``The Other Side of The Wall,'' on the making of
the film, and a look back on the film's continued appeal in
``Retrospective.''

   Half of all Americans are now considered overweight, and
one-third are obese. Type II diabetes, which accounts for 90
percent of diabetes and is closely associated with excess weight,
is at least three times more prevalent among Americans than it was
in the 1960s, and eight times more common than in 1935. ``Among
people over 65, about 20 percent have diabetes,'' notes Dr. Edward
S. Horton of Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gene pool hasn't changed'' to produce this epidemic, says
Dr. Robert H. Eckel of the University of Colorado Health Sciences
Center, who chairs the American Heart Association's committee on
nutrition. What has changed is the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Although the average adult male needs about 2,500 calories a day
to meet basic energy needs and the average woman needs about 2,000,
the US food industry produces enough to feed everybody 3,800
calories a day _ and somebody is eating all those extra calories.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are dissecting the chemical controls that govern the
use of glucose and insulin by lean muscle; so far the evidence
underscores the importance of maintaining muscle mass. ``What we've
discovered is that exercise and insulin both increase glucose
uptake by the movement of glucose transporter molecules called
GLUT-4 to the surface of muscle cells,'' says Laurie Goodyear, a
Joslin Clinic researcher. ``Trained'' muscle contains more GLUT-4,
it turns out. Goodyear hopes her research will lead to a drug that
mimics exercise's effect on muscle chemistry _ not to make exercise
unnecessary, but to augment its benefits. ``You can't exercise all
the time,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   While we're waiting for an ``exercise pill,'' the current
consensus is that exercise is crucial in simultaneously reducing
weight and lowering the risks of diabetes and other maladies
associated with age and obesity, such as heart disease and
arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   Even a modest amount of exercise _ and a weight loss of only 5
to 10 percent _ can produce measurable health benefits. Researchers
have found that exercise can increase metabolic rate by up to 15
percent _ enough to give an elder individual the metabolic rate of
a 30-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   By riding the exercise bicycle several times a week in a Joslin
Clinic program, for instance, Ira Phillips has lost 11 pounds and
lowered her daily insulin dose by 24 percent over the past five
months. She'd like to lose another 40 pounds, but experts are
divided on whether that much weight loss is necessary or beneficial
among people in their 70s.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips has also begun doing light weight-lifting at home. To
preserve or build lean muscle mass, that kind of ``resistance''
training is increasingly recognized as an important addition to a
regimen of regular ``endurance'' exercise, such as brisk 30-minute
walks.
</P>
<P>
   Muscle-building, researchers now know, is possible at any age.
``We're talking about simple things that anyone can do at home,''
says Miriam Nelson of Tufts, author of ``Strong Women Stay Young''
and ``Strong Women Stay Slim.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson says her older patients are often pleasantly surprised to
find they like weight training. ``I work with a lot of older women
who have never been strong in their lives,'' she says. ``People
love feeling their muscles getting stronger. Everyday activities
become easier. Your body feels different, and becomes firmer.''
</P>
<P>
   And it will probably last longer, too.

<P>
   Scientists using the most powerful computers ever brought to
bear on human biology are within months of completing a first
reading of the genetic ``Book of Life,'' the information coded in
DNA that says why one person looks and acts differently than
another, why some are more prone to fall sick, and what exactly
goes awry in the body when that happens.
</P>
<P>
   This work, underway in laboratories from Cambridge to Tokyo, is
almost certain to ignite a revolution in medicine in the early 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
   Such knowledge should help doctors and researchers understand
more about disease: what causes a child to develop cancer, a
teenager to have schizophrenia, and an older person to be stricken
by Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   And if researchers' highest hopes are met, knowledge of the
human DNA code will help scientists fashion novel treatments for
nearly every human ailment.
</P>
<P>
   Already the new genetic information is fueling a boom in
pharmaceutical and biotechnology research. The Kendall Square area
of Cambridge, Mass. _ next door to the Whitehead Institute at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a key node in the
government-sponsored Human Genome Project _ has become a magnet for
companies working on gene-based diagnostic tools and treatments.
They are expected to become increasingly important in the regional
economy.
</P>
<P>
   By spring, the Human Genome Project will have produced a rough
draft of the human genome, what some scientists refer to as the
``Book of Life,'' the basic instructions for operating the human
body. The complete text of all human DNA will be posted on the
Internet for anyone to use.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be the most important step we've taken in science,''
said James Watson, who helped launch the new era of genetics nearly
50 years ago by discovering, with Francis Crick, the structure of
deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got our instruction book: how to build the 747,'' Watson
said. ``We can't read it all yet. But that we've evolved to where
we can have the book, that's pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists involved in the genome project say they are building
a kind of public infrastructure that will fuel a boom in medical
research, just as the interstate highway system laid the groundwork
for the nation's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Their work will prove to be more important than splitting the
atom or putting a man on the moon, said Dr. Francis Collins, a
geneticist at the National Institutes of Health who acts as
coordinator of the Human Genome Project.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to change the way medicine is practiced, and it
will forever alter the way biological and medical research is
done,'' Collins said. It could bring new treatments for every
single human disease, he added.
</P>
<P>
   DNA is carried by every person, in the heart of almost every
cell. It is made up of four chemicals linked in a huge chain
estimated at 3 billion chemicals in length. Mapping it all has been
a decade-long task involving thousands of scientists in
laboratories around the world. The rough draft of the human genome
will list the order of all 3 billion chemicals, but it may contain
some errors. A final version is expected in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   With the genome text in hand, Collins and others say,
researchers will be able to find all the estimated 80,000 to
140,000 human genes, or segments of DNA that tell cells how to
function. Finding the genes and understanding their work in the
body will allow scientists to develop medical treatments that
attack disease at its root cause.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors hope one day to replace the faulty genes responsible for
illnesses like cystic fibrosis. New drugs that make some genes more
active and others less active may treat hypertension, obesity, and
heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   By studying genes more closely, researchers should deepen their
understanding of human behavior and mental illnesses such as
schizophrenia and manic-depressive disorder. By analyzing a
person's genes, doctors might be able to diagnose an illness long
before the patient develops symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   But some see risks. Just as the World War II-era Manhattan
Project brought the risk of nuclear war to an unprepared world, the
human genome project could give scientists potent genetic tools
before society has sorted out their implications.
</P>
<P>
   As scientists fashion new treatments for cancer or obesity by
manipulating genes, they may also learn how to alter the genes that
control traits such as height, athleticism, or intelligence.
Scientists have already reported manipulating genes to make
laboratory mice ``smarter'' and ``more sociable.'' That leaves
society to face questions about which traits should be changed,
which left alone, and who should have power to decide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even those of us who don't take Genesis literally see a vast
mystery in the origin of our species and in each of our
destinies,'' said Ronald Green, a Dartmouth College professor who
served as an ethicist to the Human Genome Project.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, we are learning how to change, almost at will, the
blueprint for building a human being. ``We can fashion new life
forms; we are already doing that,'' Green said. ``Some of us see us
taking the evolution of our species into our own hands.''
</P>
<P>
   As scientists learn to diagnose diseases by analyzing genes, the
public will have to decide what to do with the knowledge. Should a
7-year-old be told that she may develop breast cancer at age 35 or
Alzheimer's at age 70? Should her insurance company know? What if
there were no steps she could take to cut her risk?
</P>
<P>
   US law allows companies to patent genes, but some critics argue
that the genome is a natural human resource that shouldn't be
licensed to anyone exclusively. Critics also fear that putting so
much emphasis on the importance of genes could lead people into
extreme ``genetic determinism'' _ the notion that most human
activity is dictated by genes _ and prompt discrimination based on
peoples' DNA.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Genes are small sections of DNA scattered throughout the genome
that tell cells how to handle the daily tasks of life, such as
reproducing, fighting illness, and communicating with other cells.
They tell an embryo how to turn into a fetus and a child how to
turn into an adult. Specifically, each gene tells the cells how to
build a protein, and proteins, in turn, are the agents that do work
in the body.
</P>
<P>
   Many illnesses can be traced to a flawed gene or set of genes,
which produce a faulty protein or too much or too little of a
protein. In fact, nearly every illness seems to have a genetic
component, even those in which a person's behavior or living
conditions clearly play a role. Why does one french fry-lover
develop clogged arteries while another doesn't? Why does one
asbestos factory worker develop cancer while another remains
healthy? At least in part, scientists say, the answer is in the
genes.
</P>
<P>
   It will take decades to find all the genes and learn how they
function in the body and interact with each other.So far, progress
has been slow. Even knowing which genes are responsible for cystic
fibrosis, muscular dystrophy, sickle cell anemia, and many other
illnesses, scientists have not come up with cures. Gene therapy,
the attempt to replace faulty genes with new ones, has still to
prove successful after more than two decades of research.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really bothers me is the hype going along with these
projects, giving the sense that cures are just around the corner,''
said Jonathan Beckwith, a Harvard microbiologist and an advisory
board member of the Council for Responsible Genetics in Cambridge.

BROOKS SEES NO LOSS IN PLAYING GAINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is Garth Brooks tired of country music? No way, and he's stung
by any suggestion that he is. Brooks becomes upset when recalling
the words of a country disc jockey who said recently, ``Now that
country music is down, Garth is bailing out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That really hurt,'' said Brooks, calling from his Nashville
home to discuss a new, short-term career move in which he departs
from country to make pop-rock music under the name of Chris Gaines,
a fictitious rocker who is the subject of a Paramount Pictures film
to be released next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Brooks album, ``Garth Brooks in the Life of Chris Gaines,''
comes out Tuesday (Sept. 28). In it, Brooks indulges his love of
musical influences from the Beatles, James Taylor, Steely Dan,
Fleetwood Mac, the Eagles, and Bob Dylan _ all of whom he heard
growing up, when he was not listening to George Jones, George
Strait, and other country icons.
</P>
<P>
   Most impressively, Brooks pulls it off. The album has a retro
feel _ it's designed to be a ``Greatest Hits'' of tunes from the
fictional character's last 15 years _ and Brooks, though writing
none of the songs and singing in higher keys than his country hits,
sounds entirely believable. He also sounds entirely different _ a
smooth-voiced change from the twangy Garth style that has helped
him sell 95 million albums, a sales record second only to the
Beatles.
</P>
<P>
   The new album was produced by Don Was, the Grammy-winning
producer who worked on Bonnie Raitt's ``Nick of Time'' CD. It was
his idea to get Brooks involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The motivation was that somebody had faith in me to cut a
pop-rock album on a ficitious character,'' said Brooks. ``And once
I got into it, it was, `Holy cow, these people have invested their
money and their faith in me. I'd better get off my butt and come
through with it.' It was fun, but in no way did this thing start by
me going, `Oh, I've got to get out of this Garth Brooks thing.' I
don't know why people have kept harping on that, as if there's some
kind of story there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not looking to get out of what I've got,'' he said. ``No,
this was just a compliment and a challenge to do.'
</P>
<P>
   Brooks admitted, though, that some hardcore Garth fans ``may
want to sit this one out.'' He knows some fans have also been
puzzled by his new look for the project _ with hair falling over
his eyes and a hint of chin growth for bohemian effect _ but ``you
do it because you're playing a character, that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   That character will soon be on active display. The
Brooks-as-Gaines impersonation hits overdrive with a TV special on
NBC this Wednesday (CBS at 8 p.m.), in which Brooks will sing tunes
from the album. Appearances are also lined up on ``The Tonight Show
with Jay Leno'' Tusday the ``Rosie O'Donnell Show'' and ``Late
Night with Conan O'Brien'' on Tuesday, and ``The Today Show'' on
Wednesday. Also, VH1 is producing a mock-documentary on Gaines for
some time in November. It's in the vein of the cable station's
``Behind the Music'' series, but won't be called that.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount Pictures is readying the film on Gaines for next fall,
titled ``The Lamb.'' A soundtrack album, which Brooks has
contracted for, will be released at that time. It's supposed to be
the ``Sargent Pepper'' of Gaines's career _ and the first track
will be produced by Babyface. ``That should set the tone for it,''
said Brooks, who will perform as Gaines in the film, but won't
otherwise act in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hard story to get all the information on, but once you
get it, Chris is just a normal, existing artist,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the fictional gist: Gaines was born in 1967 in Brisbane,
Australia, the son of Olympic swimmers. He moved to Los Angeles
when he was 5. His career took off in the late '80s, but he
suffered a car accident in 1992 that led to plastic surgery and a
more reclusive lifestyle. Along the way, his music matured from
rock to R &AMP; B, all reflected in Brooks's treatments of the songs,
which were mostly written by the trio of Gordon Kennedy, Wayne
Kirkpatrick, and Tommy Sims. (They're the team who wrote writing
the Grammy-winning hit ``Change the World'' for Eric Clapton,
though Sims is also known as the bassist on Bruce Springsteen's
non-E Street Band tour in 1992.)
</P>
<P>
   The musicians backing Brooks-as-Gaines are not from Brooks's
band, but include backup singer Crystal Talifero (from Billy Joel's
group), bassist Hutch Hutchinson (from Raitt's band), keyboardist
Greg Phillinganes (who has toured with Clapton), and drummer Kenny
Aronoff (who has toured with Melissa Etheridge).
</P>
<P>
   The album's first single, ``Lost in You,'' was recently the No.
1 most-added song on Top 40 radio. ``I get lost in you _ what is
this feeling?'' sings Brooks, sounding like a cross between Richard
Marx and Smokey Robinson. The tempo picks up in the Dire
Straits-like ``White Flag'' and the song ``Maybe,'' which
incorporates the hippie refrain from the Youngbloods' ``Get
Together.'' It's supposed to show Gaines's idealism even though the
song is old enough that ``he would have had to have written it at
age 1,'' Brooks said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   There are obvious campy elements to all of this _ and obvious
questions about the public's acceptance of it. Yet the music is
delivered with a straight face, a journeyman's craft, and an
emotional high from Brooks, who clearly has his heart in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you saw what Chris believed in _ he became an easy
character to love,'' said Brooks, who won't tour behind the record,
but is proud of the results. ``When people ask what's the
difference between this and a Garth record, I say, `Man, Garth
records are simple to make. This whole thing is not.' ''

TOWN TRIES TO PUT SOGGY PIECES BACK TOGETHER AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PRINCEVILLE, N.C. _ Their Bibles are lost in flood waters that
carry the caskets of their ancestors, the carcasses of their pets,
and the remains of their neighbors who defied the unfathomable.
</P>
<P>
   Their churches are buried in the sea of death. So is everything
they scratched together with the dirt-poor wages they earned making
toy Santa Clauses and frozen pastries on factory assembly lines.
</P>
<P>
   As heirs to the nation's first black-governed town, chartered by
freed slaves after the Civil War, the homeless refugees from
Princeville fled with little more than faith 10 nights ago when
Hurricane Floyd ripped open a sprawling dike and turned the Tar
River against the townspeople.
</P>
<P>
   Like characters in ``Their Eyes Were Watching God,'' Zora Neale
Hurston's fictitious account of a flood ravaging another small,
black community, ``They seemed to be staring at the dark, but their
eyes were watching God.''
</P>
<P>
   Their eyes still are. With the grace of God and the spirit of
their forebears, the proud souls of Princeville said this week that
they plan to lift up their historic town again as a landmark of
self-determination. They made the vow even as they languished on
borrowed cots in crowded, grimy shelters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the native sons, the last black princes,'' said George
Harrison, 66, the descendant of Princeville mayors and police
chiefs, as he sat on the edge of a rickety cot in the corner of a
hallway of a high school in nearby Tarboro that now is home to
hundreds of his former neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pride is in us, and it will push us,'' Harrison said.
``This is not the end of Princeville. It will come back greater now
than it has ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   Their town is one of scores in North Carolina that have been
altered irreparably by a flood that, metereologists said, was the
worst to strike the region since Columbus discovered America.
Sewage-treatment plants and lagoons of hog waste have overflowed
and contaminated drinking water supplies, while the floating
carcasses of hundreds of thousands of hogs, chickens, and turkeys
embody the $1 billion of farm damages.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's deadliest hurricane in a generation, Floyd has
officially claimed nearly 70 lives _ 42 in eastern North Carolina
alone _ and the toll is expected to grow as the waters recede in
Princeville, where the flood ran deepest.
</P>
<P>
   The last survivors of the deluge escaped from Princeville on
flatbed trucks, boats, and helicopters. Like Eva Gray, 31, a
factory worker, many of them nearly died as they stood helplessly
in shoulder-deep water, gagging as they breathed fumes from
ruptured fuel tanks, and watched the bodies of dead animals float
past them.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said she heard neighbors shriek for help from nearby roofs
as she sobbed and shuddered in the churning waters until a rescue
boat arrived. She abandoned everything she owned inside her home,
including $500 in cash she had ``saved for hard times.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nightmares every night,'' Gray said in the high school
library, a sanctuary for those who survived some of the worst
trauma. ``My nerves are so tense. It's going to be hard, but I've
got to get my life back.''
</P>
<P>
   Princeville, too, wants its life back. But the community has
survived many calamities since the town was born in 1885, settled
by newly freed slaves who found refuge there after the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   After the troops left, the former slaves built their own homes,
bought their land, and opened their own schools and churches,
including the Mount Zion Primitive Baptist Church, whose
103-year-old altar and pews remained under water Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Princeville's founders survived white supremacists bent on
extinguishing this symbol of black liberation. Later generations
overcame agricultural disasters, the tug of faraway jobs after the
industrial revolution, and a spate of mismanagement that in 1997
caused the state for a year to take over the town's finances.
</P>
<P>
   Princeville also endured floods. Many floods. Though they were
small compared with Floyd's, the floods were supposed to end after
a 3-mile-wide earthen dike was built in 1965 to protect Princeville
from the Tar River's fury. And there was such promise in the air
that town leaders were set to begin offering a historical tour to
celebrate their heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there is nothing, and rebuilding will first require
restoring a sense of safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us really don't want to go back,'' said Darlene
Spell, 27, who lost her house, two cars, and two dogs in the
disaster. ``There's so many bad memories there, and I feel like if
it happened once, it will happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Signs of despair and deprivation abound in the teeming shelters
around Princeville. As National Guard units stand sentinel outside
and military helicopters ferry in supplies, the Princeville
refugees sleep nearly shoulder to shoulder, surrounded by food and
secondhand clothes they have scrounged during their 10-day ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   They have no running water. No showers. Only portable toilets.
They use canvas tents for changing rooms. There is a critical
shortage of personal hygiene products and underwear. Many refugees
are wearing the same clothes they wore when they left home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look into people's eyes, and you can see the depression
setting in,'' said Shirley Bell, 45, guarding her family's meager
belongings in the school gym.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is, we are proud people,'' Bell said. ``We are
hard-working people, and we never imagined having to stand in line
for food and clothes. We never thought this could happen to us, in
little Princeville.''
</P>
<P>
   She scanned the gym, as families sat sullenly, waiting for Red
Cross workers to serve their next meal: chili and rice, and canned
peaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tearing us apart,'' Bell said. ``But we're survivors.
Eventually, we'll get it back together.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, after a helicopter tour of the devastated
area, vowed last week to help Princeville and other decimated
communities recover. But the questions remain: how, and when?
</P>
<P>
   Contaminated by raw sewage, fuel, and rotting carcasses,
Princeville may need to be razed before it can be resurrected. In
the meantime, the refugees will be housed in portable trailers, and
many of Princeville's elderly fear they will never again inhabit
the town they helped make a monument to will and sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   But the optimists among the town's refugees expect to rebuild
with the help of state and federal grants and loans. Just as
feverishly as they stacked thousands of sandbags against the dike
to fight flood waters, many of the survivors said, they expect
residents to rally to put their washed-out town together again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flood just wiped everything out, and my dream house is
gone with it,'' said Wendy Perkins, 37, a furniture company
secretary. ``But my children and I found a way to get out alive,
and now we're going to find a way to keep our town alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Many others in Princeville, in the cradle of the Bible Belt, are
also certain they will witness their town's redemption and a
brighter tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flood was the Lord saying, `I'm just going to give them
some water to let them know this is my world,' '' said Geraldine
Parker. ``It was a wake-up call for people who had lost their way.
Now, the Lord will help us make Princeville a better place. We're
all ready for that day.''

<P>
   In an instant, your body betrays you. You feel you are floating,
but you are dropping, powerless, to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   That's how Mrs. Moy in vehement Cantonese, described the most
unsettling sensation of her life.
</P>
<P>
   Now, hooked up to cardiac, blood pressure and oxygenation
monitors, with an external pacemaker's oversize pads gummed to her
chest, she felt safe. But she refused to sit up, much less walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no,'' she gestured. ``Dizzy ... so dizzy.''
</P>
<P>
   She had been sent from her cardiologist's office, the first stop
after a fainting episode at home. His note read, ``67 y.o. with
syncope and bradycardia. Diagnosis: Sick sinus syndrome. Admit for
pacemaker insertion.''
</P>
<P>
   Syncope means faint, and bradycardia means slow heart rate. Sick
sinus syndrome is a grab-all diagnosis that implies the heart's own
pacemaker can't keep time because of disease or old age.
</P>
<P>
   But this is the United States in the late 1990s, where
bradycardia is more likely to be inflicted by a doctor than nature.
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies have unleashed a swarm of cardiovascular drugs,
each one touted better and more potent than the last.
</P>
<P>
   My emergency room at New York University Downtown Hospital sees
medication-induced bradycardia so often that young doctors in
training aren't allowed to think the words sick sinus syndrome
until they first hunt down every drug a patient is taking.
</P>
<P>
   On the overhead monitor, Mrs. Moy's heartbeat trudged along in
the mid-30s; 60 to 100 is normal. Her P-waves, the small blips made
when the sinus node fires, had disappeared; a natural backup
pacemaker, nestled at the junction of the atria and the ventricles,
had taken over.
</P>
<P>
   But when this backup timer takes over, the rate is slow and
fixed, it won't speed up to compensate for low blood pressure. And
Mrs. Moy's was now ominously low.
</P>
<P>
   Meticulous case histories take time. Faced with dangerous
bradycardia, doctors want to fix everything in a hurry, before
whatever is slowing the pulse stops it altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate solution is a pacemaker. External pacemakers are
wide electrode pads gummed to the skin of the chest. They prod
nerves to fire and contract the ventricles.
</P>
<P>
   But getting zapped 60 times a minute is uncomfortable and
unreliable _ often the heart stops responding.
</P>
<P>
   Temporary internal pacemakers can work, but a wire must be
threaded through the jugular vein in the neck or the subclavian
vein under the collarbone all the way into the right ventricle.
</P>
<P>
   I ordered a half milligram of atropine. The drug would speed up
Mrs. Moy's heart by blocking the vagus nerve, which normally holds
the pacemaker in check. Nothing happened.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lisa, my fellow attending physician who is
Chinese-American, talked with Mrs. Moy's daughter about her
mother's medical history.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter dug a scrap of paper out of her purse. Lisa showed
it to me: ``Posicor. Her cardiologist started her on it nine days
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Posicor is a calcium channel blocker,'' said Peter, our
resident.
</P>
<P>
   ``She started it nine days ago,'' I mused. ``At 100 milligrams,
the highest dose, and she's a small woman. What's causing her
bradycardia?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Calcium channel blocker toxicity?'' Peter ventured.
</P>
<P>
   Calcium channel blockers slow the flow of calcium ions across
certain cell membranes. Some slow firing by pacemaker cells and
weaken heart contractions; others reduce blood pressure by dilating
narrowed blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   But all calcium channel blockers can slow the heart's pacemaker,
and that is how Mrs. Moy got into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The antidote, neatly enough, is calcium.
</P>
<P>
   We injected an ampoule of calcium. Mrs. Moy's heart rate came up
slightly. Ten minutes later we gave her another. At that point, her
blood pressure rose and her P-waves reappeared, indicating the
pacemaker cells had come out from under the Posicor. But her heart
rate wouldn't budge above 42.
</P>
<P>
   ``How does she feel?'' I asked Mrs. Moy's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   After a flurry of Cantonese, she said, ``Better.''
</P>
<P>
   The calcium, however, was only a short-term solution. We could
give one or two shots a day to keep her heart steady until the
Posicor cleared from her system.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody had enough experience with Posicor to predict how many
days that would take, so it would be tempting to install a
permanent pacemaker. But only a month ago I'd seen a pacemaker put
into an elderly woman with a sluggish heart. The next day her heart
was ticking merrily to its natural pacemaker; her beta-blocker
medication had worn off
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you dream of putting a pacemaker in this woman,'' I
badgered the admitting resident. ``Posicor has a half-life of over
</P>
<P>
   24 hours. You won't know whether it's her or the drug for at
least five days.''
</P>
<P>
   On the third day, Mrs. Moy's heart rate still hovered in the
50s. Her cardiologist was antsy. The coronary-care unit costs
$1,000 a day, an expensive way to watch and wait.
</P>
<P>
   The unit's resident, who had also suspected Posicor, was now
drifting into the sick-sinus-syndrome camp.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Mrs. Moy's room, the daughter was resigned: ``She's
still scared. She'll feel better with the pacemaker.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think it's the Posicor,'' I said, ``but the decision
is up to her cardiologist.''
</P>
<P>
   When I dropped by the next day, the telltale pacer spikes,
unlike any natural electrocardiogram wave, blipped on Mrs. Moy's
monitor. She'd gotten her pacemaker. But most of the beats were her
own.
</P>
<P>
   Pacemakers have a demand mechanism that waits for a normal
heartbeat; they only fire in its absence.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Moy looked relieved. She thanked me, little knowing I had
</P>
<P>
   opposed her magic cure to the end.
</P>
<P>
   At worst, I consoled myself, the pacemaker was a $10,000 to
$15,000 placebo: Now she would step out of her house energetic and
unafraid.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks later, the New York Times ran an article, ``Heart Drug
Withdrawn as Evidence Shows It Could Be Lethal.'' Dozens of reports
about serious side effects, including ``dangerously low heart
rate,'' had prompted the FDA to withdraw Posicor from the market.
</P>
<P>
   The critical-care resident found me.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were right,'' he admitted graciously. ``That was nasty
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry,'' I shrugged. ``Lots more miracle drugs where
that came from. Someday you'll get to play the old skeptic too.''

   The unit's resident, who had also suspected Posicor, was now
drifting into the sick-sinus-syndrome camp.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Mrs. Moy's room, the daughter was resigned: ``She's
still scared. She'll feel better with the pacemaker.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think it's the Posicor,'' I said, ``but the decision
is up to her cardiologist.''
</P>
<P>
   When I dropped by the next day, the telltale pacer spikes,
unlike any natural electrocardiogram wave, blipped on Mrs. Moy's
monitor. She'd gotten her pacemaker. But most of the beats were her
own.
</P>
<P>
   Pacemakers have a demand mechanism that waits for a normal
heartbeat; they only fire in its absence.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Moy looked relieved. She thanked me, little knowing I had
</P>
<P>
   opposed her magic cure to the end.
</P>
<P>
   At worst, I consoled myself, the pacemaker was a $10,000 to
$15,000 placebo: Now she would step out of her house energetic and
unafraid.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks later, the New York Times ran an article, ``Heart Drug
Withdrawn as Evidence Shows It Could Be Lethal.'' Dozens of reports
about serious side effects, including ``dangerously low heart
rate,'' had prompted the FDA to withdraw Posicor from the market.
</P>
<P>
   The critical-care resident found me.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were right,'' he admitted graciously. ``That was nasty
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry,'' I shrugged. ``Lots more miracle drugs where
that came from. Someday you'll get to play the old skeptic too.''

   &UR; GOOD-BYE DOLLY? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the circus procession of cloned sheep, cows, mice and
goats in the past couple years, humans seemed likely to join the
list soon. Now this sobering news: A cloned calf in France dropped
dead seven weeks after its birth.
</P>
<P>
   The calf appeared healthy until days before her death. She then
developed severe anemia and collapsed. An autopsy revealed a
withered thymus gland, where white blood cells mature, suggesting
that her immune system never started working.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Paul Renard of the National Institute for Agronomic
Research in Jouy-en-Josas, who cloned her, thinks a defective donor
cell might be at fault. He points out that the cloning process can
work fine _ other clones produced with his technique are thriving _
but concedes that 30 percent to 50 percent of cloned calves die
shortly before and immediately after birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want to apply this technique outside of research,''
Renard says, ``such a high rate of abortion and mortality will not
be acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Failure is actually the norm in the cloning business. Ryuzo
Yanagimachi at the University of Hawaii has had perhaps the
greatest success, producing five generations of cloned mice.
</P>
<P>
   Recently he created the first male clone, also a mouse. Yet
Yanagimachi and his team had to transplant 274 embryos just to
produce three live male mice, two of which died almost immediately.
That's not much of an improvement over the 276 failures that
preceded Dolly the sheep, the first mammal clone.
</P>
<P>
   There are other signs of trouble. The cloned mice were born with
mild breathing problems. More disturbing is that Dolly's
chromosomes are worn down at the edges, possibly showing signs of
premature aging.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear if she will die early. For now, she appears
healthy and has given birth to four lambs, also doing fine. But
Margaret Mellon of the Washington, D.C.-based Union of Concerned
Scientists warns: ``There are many things that could be seriously
wrong with her that would be very difficult to detect.''

<P>
   In their quest for kinder cutting, physicians increasingly rely
on endoscopic surgery, replacing large scalpels and clamps with
cameras and flexible tools that snake into the body through tiny
holes. The technique is far less traumatic for patients but
exhausting for the surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suppose I asked you to pick up a noodle from a plate,'' says
engineer Sunil Singh, ``but I put the plate inside a box with two
holes on top and asked you not just to go in and pick it up but to
cut and stitch it too.''
</P>
<P>
   Exasperated, Singh and his colleague John Wen of Endobotics and
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute developed Endobot, a robot that
can take over much of the mundane stitching and slicing during
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Endobot features two movable arms that have interchangeable
tools attached. Once the arms are in position, the surgeon flicks a
switch _ or in a future version, barks out an order _ and the tools
begin to cut, grasp, suture or drill. Those procedures are perfect
for hernia repair, gallstone removal and one day even heart
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``With our technology, the robot can synchronize its motion with
the heart and suture it while it's beating,'' Singh says.
</P>
<P>
   Endobot is expected to be used on humans in clinical trials this
fall.

 &UR; ASTEROIDS AMOK &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of all natural hazards facing us, an asteroid impact is
potentially the deadliest, and the most unpredictable. The latest
news is not heartening. Wyn Evans has discovered an asteroid belt
hovering just a few million miles beyond Earth's orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Most asteroids circle the sun in a wide band between the orbits
of Mars and Jupiter, but some nestle in zones of stability in the
outer solar system. Evans, a physicist at Oxford, wanted to see if
similar pockets of small asteroids could exist closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   Using a mathematical simulation running on 20 desktop computers,
he looked at the fates of imaginary objects plopped in orbits
between the sun and Mars. Gravity from a passing planet usually
swept the body from the solar system. But Evans found that
asteroids could survive for billions of years in orbits some 8
million to 30 million miles outside the orbit of Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Evans thinks there may be as many as 1,000 asteroids in this
near-Earth asteroid belt. He has already identified three
candidates. Although they generally stay in place, these objects
will occasionally get knocked loose by the gravity of Earth and
other planets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some danger,'' Evans says, ``because there are ways
to eject objects out of the belt. But any Earth-crossing asteroid
is potentially dangerous no matter where it came from.''
</P>
<P>

 &UR; BABY BIG BANGS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At least once a day, a brilliant flash of gamma rays appears
from a random direction. After a three-decade hunt, astronomers may
have tracked down the sources of these blasts of energetic,
invisible radiation. A pair of gas clouds in a nearby galaxy
appears to be the tortured remains of two ancient gamma-ray bursts.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Wang, an astrophysicist at Northwestern University, was
studying images of the Pinwheel galaxy, or M101, when he noticed
the two unusual objects. They looked like the remains of
supernovas, rare and powerful stellar explosions, but were far too
bright.
</P>
<P>
   Wang believes he has spotted the aftermath of hypernovas,
theoretical events in which dying stars blow off their outer layers
and collapse into black holes. They may be the fiercest blasts
since the beginning of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   When gamma-ray bursts were first detected by military satellites
in the 1960s, nobody knew where they came from. Scientists have
since deduced that they occur in the most distant corners of the
cosmos and have wondered what could possibly power them. Hypernovas
could do the trick. These explosions probably occur among young,
massive stars, so gamma-ray bursts may contain a hidden message
about how galaxies evolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the distribution of gamma-ray bursts, we may be able to
infer the history of star formation in the universe,'' Wang says.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   In an instant, your body betrays you. You feel you are floating,
but you are dropping, powerless, to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   That's how Mrs. Moy in vehement Cantonese, described the most
unsettling sensation of her life.
</P>
<P>
   Now, hooked up to cardiac, blood pressure and oxygenation
monitors, with an external pacemaker's oversize pads gummed to her
chest, she felt safe. But she refused to sit up, much less walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no,'' she gestured. ``Dizzy ... so dizzy.''
</P>
<P>
   She had been sent from her cardiologist's office, the first stop
after a fainting episode at home. His note read, ``67 y.o. with
syncope and bradycardia. Diagnosis: Sick sinus syndrome. Admit for
pacemaker insertion.''
</P>
<P>
   Syncope means faint, and bradycardia means slow heart rate. Sick
sinus syndrome is a grab-all diagnosis that implies the heart's own
pacemaker can't keep time because of disease or old age.
</P>
<P>
   But this is the United States in the late 1990s, where
bradycardia is more likely to be inflicted by a doctor than nature.
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies have unleashed a swarm of cardiovascular drugs,
each one touted better and more potent than the last.
</P>
<P>
   My emergency room at New York University Downtown Hospital sees
medication-induced bradycardia so often that young doctors in
training aren't allowed to think the words sick sinus syndrome
until they first hunt down every drug a patient is taking.
</P>
<P>
   On the overhead monitor, Mrs. Moy's heartbeat trudged along in
the mid-30s; 60 to 100 is normal. Her P-waves, the small blips made
when the sinus node fires, had disappeared; a natural backup
pacemaker, nestled at the junction of the atria and the ventricles,
had taken over.
</P>
<P>
   But when this backup timer takes over, the rate is slow and
fixed, it won't speed up to compensate for low blood pressure. And
Mrs. Moy's was now ominously low.
</P>
<P>
   Meticulous case histories take time. Faced with dangerous
bradycardia, doctors want to fix everything in a hurry, before
whatever is slowing the pulse stops it altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate solution is a pacemaker. External pacemakers are
wide electrode pads gummed to the skin of the chest. They prod
nerves to fire and contract the ventricles.
</P>
<P>
   But getting zapped 60 times a minute is uncomfortable and
unreliable _ often the heart stops responding.
</P>
<P>
   Temporary internal pacemakers can work, but a wire must be
threaded through the jugular vein in the neck or the subclavian
vein under the collarbone all the way into the right ventricle.
</P>
<P>
   I ordered a half milligram of atropine. The drug would speed up
Mrs. Moy's heart by blocking the vagus nerve, which normally holds
the pacemaker in check. Nothing happened.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lisa, my fellow attending physician who is
Chinese-American, talked with Mrs. Moy's daughter about her
mother's medical history.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter dug a scrap of paper out of her purse. Lisa showed
it to me: ``Posicor. Her cardiologist started her on it nine days
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Posicor is a calcium channel blocker,'' said Peter, our
resident.
</P>
<P>
   ``She started it nine days ago,'' I mused. ``At 100 milligrams,
the highest dose, and she's a small woman. What's causing her
bradycardia?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Calcium channel blocker toxicity?'' Peter ventured.
</P>
<P>
   Calcium channel blockers slow the flow of calcium ions across
certain cell membranes. Some slow firing by pacemaker cells and
weaken heart contractions; others reduce blood pressure by dilating
narrowed blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   But all calcium channel blockers can slow the heart's pacemaker,
and that is how Mrs. Moy got into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The antidote, neatly enough, is calcium.
</P>
<P>
   We injected an ampoule of calcium. Mrs. Moy's heart rate came up
slightly. Ten minutes later we gave her another. At that point, her
blood pressure rose and her P-waves reappeared, indicating the
pacemaker cells had come out from under the Posicor. But her heart
rate wouldn't budge above 42.
</P>
<P>
   ``How does she feel?'' I asked Mrs. Moy's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   After a flurry of Cantonese, she said, ``Better.''
</P>
<P>
   The calcium, however, was only a short-term solution. We could
give one or two shots a day to keep her heart steady until the
Posicor cleared from her system.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody had enough experience with Posicor to predict how many
days that would take, so it would be tempting to install a
permanent pacemaker. But only a month ago I'd seen a pacemaker put
into an elderly woman with a sluggish heart. The next day her heart
was ticking merrily to its natural pacemaker; her beta-blocker
medication had worn off
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you dream of putting a pacemaker in this woman,'' I
badgered the admitting resident. ``Posicor has a half-life of over
</P>
<P>
   24 hours. You won't know whether it's her or the drug for at
least five days.''
</P>
<P>
   On the third day, Mrs. Moy's heart rate still hovered in the
50s. Her cardiologist was antsy. The coronary-care unit costs
$1,000 a day, an expensive way to watch and wait.
</P>
<P>
   The unit's resident, who had also suspected Posicor, was now
drifting into the sick-sinus-syndrome camp.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Mrs. Moy's room, the daughter was resigned: ``She's
still scared. She'll feel better with the pacemaker.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think it's the Posicor,'' I said, ``but the decision
is up to her cardiologist.''
</P>
<P>
   When I dropped by the next day, the telltale pacer spikes,
unlike any natural electrocardiogram wave, blipped on Mrs. Moy's
monitor. She'd gotten her pacemaker. But most of the beats were her
own.
</P>
<P>
   Pacemakers have a demand mechanism that waits for a normal
heartbeat; they only fire in its absence.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Moy looked relieved. She thanked me, little knowing I had
</P>
<P>
   opposed her magic cure to the end.
</P>
<P>
   At worst, I consoled myself, the pacemaker was a $10,000 to
$15,000 placebo: Now she would step out of her house energetic and
unafraid.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks later, the New York Times ran an article, ``Heart Drug
Withdrawn as Evidence Shows It Could Be Lethal.'' Dozens of reports
about serious side effects, including ``dangerously low heart
rate,'' had prompted the FDA to withdraw Posicor from the market.
</P>
<P>
   The critical-care resident found me.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were right,'' he admitted graciously. ``That was nasty
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry,'' I shrugged. ``Lots more miracle drugs where
that came from. Someday you'll get to play the old skeptic too.''

<P>
   In an instant, your body betrays you. You feel you are floating,
but you are dropping, powerless, to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   That's how Mrs. Moy in vehement Cantonese, described the most
unsettling sensation of her life.
</P>
<P>
   Now, hooked up to cardiac, blood pressure and oxygenation
monitors, with an external pacemaker's oversize pads gummed to her
chest, she felt safe. But she refused to sit up, much less walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no,'' she gestured. ``Dizzy ... so dizzy.''
</P>
<P>
   She had been sent from her cardiologist's office, the first stop
after a fainting episode at home. His note read, ``67 y.o. with
syncope and bradycardia. Diagnosis: Sick sinus syndrome. Admit for
pacemaker insertion.''
</P>
<P>
   Syncope means faint, and bradycardia means slow heart rate. Sick
sinus syndrome is a grab-all diagnosis that implies the heart's own
pacemaker can't keep time because of disease or old age.
</P>
<P>
   But this is the United States in the late 1990s, where
bradycardia is more likely to be inflicted by a doctor than nature.
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies have unleashed a swarm of cardiovascular drugs,
each one touted better and more potent than the last.
</P>
<P>
   My emergency room at New York University Downtown Hospital sees
medication-induced bradycardia so often that young doctors in
training aren't allowed to think the words sick sinus syndrome
until they first hunt down every drug a patient is taking.
</P>
<P>
   On the overhead monitor, Mrs. Moy's heartbeat trudged along in
the mid-30s; 60 to 100 is normal. Her P-waves, the small blips made
when the sinus node fires, had disappeared; a natural backup
pacemaker, nestled at the junction of the atria and the ventricles,
had taken over.
</P>
<P>
   But when this backup timer takes over, the rate is slow and
fixed, it won't speed up to compensate for low blood pressure. And
Mrs. Moy's was now ominously low.
</P>
<P>
   Meticulous case histories take time. Faced with dangerous
bradycardia, doctors want to fix everything in a hurry, before
whatever is slowing the pulse stops it altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate solution is a pacemaker. External pacemakers are
wide electrode pads gummed to the skin of the chest. They prod
nerves to fire and contract the ventricles.
</P>
<P>
   But getting zapped 60 times a minute is uncomfortable and
unreliable _ often the heart stops responding.
</P>
<P>
   Temporary internal pacemakers can work, but a wire must be
threaded through the jugular vein in the neck or the subclavian
vein under the collarbone all the way into the right ventricle.
</P>
<P>
   I ordered a half milligram of atropine. The drug would speed up
Mrs. Moy's heart by blocking the vagus nerve, which normally holds
the pacemaker in check. Nothing happened.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lisa, my fellow attending physician who is
Chinese-American, talked with Mrs. Moy's daughter about her
mother's medical history.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter dug a scrap of paper out of her purse. Lisa showed
it to me: ``Posicor. Her cardiologist started her on it nine days
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Posicor is a calcium channel blocker,'' said Peter, our
resident.
</P>
<P>
   ``She started it nine days ago,'' I mused. ``At 100 milligrams,
the highest dose, and she's a small woman. What's causing her
bradycardia?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Calcium channel blocker toxicity?'' Peter ventured.
</P>
<P>
   Calcium channel blockers slow the flow of calcium ions across
certain cell membranes. Some slow firing by pacemaker cells and
weaken heart contractions; others reduce blood pressure by dilating
narrowed blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   But all calcium channel blockers can slow the heart's pacemaker,
and that is how Mrs. Moy got into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The antidote, neatly enough, is calcium.
</P>
<P>
   We injected an ampoule of calcium. Mrs. Moy's heart rate came up
slightly. Ten minutes later we gave her another. At that point, her
blood pressure rose and her P-waves reappeared, indicating the
pacemaker cells had come out from under the Posicor. But her heart
rate wouldn't budge above 42.
</P>
<P>
   ``How does she feel?'' I asked Mrs. Moy's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   After a flurry of Cantonese, she said, ``Better.''
</P>
<P>
   The calcium, however, was only a short-term solution. We could
give one or two shots a day to keep her heart steady until the
Posicor cleared from her system.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody had enough experience with Posicor to predict how many
days that would take, so it would be tempting to install a
permanent pacemaker. But only a month ago I'd seen a pacemaker put
into an elderly woman with a sluggish heart. The next day her heart
was ticking merrily to its natural pacemaker; her beta-blocker
medication had worn off
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you dream of putting a pacemaker in this woman,'' I
badgered the admitting resident. ``Posicor has a half-life of over
</P>
<P>
   24 hours. You won't know whether it's her or the drug for at
least five days.''
</P>
<P>
   On the third day, Mrs. Moy's heart rate still hovered in the
50s. Her cardiologist was antsy. The coronary-care unit costs
$1,000 a day, an expensive way to watch and wait.
</P>
<P>
   The unit's resident, who had also suspected Posicor, was now
drifting into the sick-sinus-syndrome camp.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Mrs. Moy's room, the daughter was resigned: ``She's
still scared. She'll feel better with the pacemaker.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think it's the Posicor,'' I said, ``but the decision
is up to her cardiologist.''
</P>
<P>
   When I dropped by the next day, the telltale pacer spikes,
unlike any natural electrocardiogram wave, blipped on Mrs. Moy's
monitor. She'd gotten her pacemaker. But most of the beats were her
own.
</P>
<P>
   Pacemakers have a demand mechanism that waits for a normal
heartbeat; they only fire in its absence.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Moy looked relieved. She thanked me, little knowing I had
</P>
<P>
   opposed her magic cure to the end.
</P>
<P>
   At worst, I consoled myself, the pacemaker was a $10,000 to
$15,000 placebo: Now she would step out of her house energetic and
unafraid.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks later, the New York Times ran an article, ``Heart Drug
Withdrawn as Evidence Shows It Could Be Lethal.'' Dozens of reports
about serious side effects, including ``dangerously low heart
rate,'' had prompted the FDA to withdraw Posicor from the market.
</P>
<P>
   The critical-care resident found me.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were right,'' he admitted graciously. ``That was nasty
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry,'' I shrugged. ``Lots more miracle drugs where
that came from. Someday you'll get to play the old skeptic too.''

BILL BRADLEY: LONG SHOT NO MORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The feeling is as definite as the growing autumn chill: Bill
Bradley has crossed the mysterious line that separates long shots
from formidable contenders.
</P>
<P>
   The political alchemy transforming him from distant prospect to
hot property has been so sudden that even the former US senator
from New Jersey seems surprised at the growing sense he can beat
Vice President Al Gore for the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people feel that way, that shows we're making progress,''
Bradley said cautiously last week. ``But it's only a snapshot in
time. We're up against real establishment power.''
</P>
<P>
   That establishment power, in the form of Gore and the
institutional loyalties and resources he can command, is what makes
the snapshot all the more remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Gore still leads his &UR;  &LR; only rival nationwide. But &UR;  &LR; whereas
several &UR;  &LR; months ago Bradley &UR;  &LR; seemed to be laboring &UR;  &LR; against almost
impos &UR;  &LR; sible odds, now there's &UR;  &LR; a realistic route to victory. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In serious, civic-minded Iowa, he's poised to do well.
</P>
<P>
   In independent New Hampshire, whose primary is a proven campaign
catapult,here's increasing talk _ supported by polls _ that Bradley
may well win.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, whose contest will prove the East Coast anchor of
the March 7 round of primaries, he's erased a large deficit to pull
essentially even. Not only did retiring New York Senator Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, king of the political cognitariat, endorse
Bradley last week, he declared Gore unelectable.
</P>
<P>
   What should Gore be thinking?
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be very worried because I am vice president and
because there is a (Clinton) fatigue factor and everybody knows
it,'' answers Mario Cuomo, former governor of New York, whose son
Andrew, secretary of Housing and Urban Development, is a Gore ally.
</P>
<P>
   As worrisome for Gore is that Bradley continues to fare
significantly better in national polls against Republican
front-runner George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Gore were 15 points ahead of Bush instead of 15 points
behind, we wouldn't be talking about Bill Bradley today,'' says
pollster Geoffrey Garin, president of Peter Hart Research
Associates, which polls for a third of the 45 Democrats in the US
Senate. ``The continuing opportunity for Bradley is nervousness
about whether Gore is a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, with Bradley now seen as increasingly plausible, the
endorsements are rolling in. Consider his lineup last week in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   A former Granite State senator, John Durkin, stood with him on
Tuesday; on Wednesday, Portsmouth's former mayor Eileen Foley
signed aboard, as did 17 Strafford County political figures. In a
sign of the growing concern at Gore central, an aide from his camp
started showing up at Bradley events, passing out lists of Gore
endorsers to deflate his rival's announcements.
</P>
<P>
   Why has Bradley gained so much ground?
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that Clinton fatigue has thrown Gore's legitimate
accomplishments into the shadows.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't see Al Gore the vice president and all he did in
foreign affairs and all the help he was to the president
intellectually,'' says Cuomo. Instead, Cuomo says, the public
thinks: ``He is not a bad guy, he is not going to mess around with
interns, but he stood there while the other guy was messing around
with interns.''
</P>
<P>
   Cut to a Bradley event Tuesday in Manchester.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bradley could make mincemeat of Bush, and I don't
think Gore could,'' Mary Sayer, a Concord independent, says. ``Gore
stood right with Clinton. He is not Clinton, but he backed
Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a sentiment voiced over and over in New Hampshire: Gore
is simply too Clinton-scarred to win, whereas Bradley presents a
fresher, cleaner face for next November.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the surprising turn of events is more than a simple
matter of Gore playing the picture to Clinton's Dorian Gray.
</P>
<P>
   Some candidates are born to opportunity, some create
opportunity, still others have opportunity thrust upon them. With
Bill Bradley, it's been all three.
</P>
<P>
   For most voters this is still a campaign of atmospherics, but
impressions of Bradley, a well-known name since his days as a
Princeton basketball star, are strongly favorable. Ask why people
like him, and the responses are very similar to what voters said
about Paul Tsongas in 1992, when the late former US senator ran for
the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Bradley's 18 years in the Senate, people don't see
Bradley as a typical politician. Instead, they think he is decent,
honest, and sincere, mature, independent, and thoughtful. And
gutsy. In short, at a time when the long-running Clinton follies
have triggered a backlash against all things slick and slippery,
voters find Bradley authentic. That's made at least a temporary
virtue of a style so low-key it is sometimes soporific.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, his willingness to take more liberal positions than
Gore on guns and campaign finance, as well as his rejection of
political action committee, or PAC, money, have made favorable
impressions on informed activists. (Bradley plans to increase that
profile in upcoming weeks with speeches laying out proposals to
expand health care and fight poverty.)
</P>
<P>
   Many of those voters would have been with Bradley regardless of
his poll standing. But he's also starting to benefit from
pragmatists willing to consider him because he's now viable.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has made a lot of ground in a short time,'' said Peter
Mantos, 52, a Dover independent who came to hear Bradley at a
Portsmouth labor hall and left sold on the candidate. ``A few
months ago, I wouldn't have thought he would be doing as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Add Gore's negatives and Bradley's positives, and you've got the
dynamic that has left political observers saying the man who was
widely dismissed six months ago as a dull, ethereal policy wonk who
could barely hold onto his own Senate seat in 1990 could actually
wrest the nomination from Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``There hasn't been a sitting vice president to lose his party's
nomination in this century, but Bradley has done a great job of
raising money and positioning himself,'' says US Representative
Martin Meehan of Massachusetts, who leans toward Gore. ``He has a
shot to win.''
</P>
<P>
   To examine just how that might happen requires a bit of insider
handicapping that goes like this:
</P>
<P>
   Bradley would need to start with a solid second in the late
January Iowa caucuses. From there, he'd need a victory in New
Hampshire on Feb. 8.
</P>
<P>
   That would allow Bradley to surf into March on the newsweekly
covers, the talk of the nation. Eleven states are currently slated
to hold primaries on March 7, but two will dominate the headlines:
New York and California.
</P>
<P>
   Should he lose both, Bradley would be ready for last rites.
</P>
<P>
   But should he win both, ``Dollar Bill'' suddenly becomes the
decided favorite.
</P>
<P>
   If the two split the big prizes, outcomes in the other March 7
races become important. With a New Hampshire win under his belt,
Bradley would be well-positioned to sweep the five other New
England states plus Ohio, leaving Gore with an advantage in Georgia
and Missouri. Call Maryland a tossup.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the campaign heads south, where, in past races,
wounded front-runners like Walter Mondale and George Bush have been
able to regroup and recover.
</P>
<P>
   In that event, despite widespread predictions of a truncated
race decided by mid-March, the course may well be set for a
campaign that goes to the last primary.
</P>
<P>
   But go back to New York and California, the two cornerstone
states of March 7. How do they look four months out? Well, a
Bradley win in New Hampshire would create momentum that would
probably carry him to a New York victory.
</P>
<P>
   That means Gore would have to prevail in California, where he
enjoys strong support from Governor Gray Davis and much of the
Democratic establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Would California stay with a shaky vice president rocked by a
New Hampshire defeat? No one knows, nor is recent history
particularly instructive, since the nomination has usually been all
but decided by the time the Golden State, which in the past has
voted in June, goes to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1984, when then US senator Gary Hart's up-from-nowhere
challenge revealed the tepidness of Mondale's support, California
opted for the challenger, not the establishment favorite.
</P>
<P>
   California political consultant Bill Carrick, a veteran of
several national campaigns, says Gore remains strong now with state
Democrats, but Bradley clearly has opportunities to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Carrick's bottom line: ``I think you have to look at it and say
California is a pretty trendy state, and if there is a lot of
momentum and free media coverage about Bradley being this insurgent
giant killer, that would scare me if I was Gore.''

   &UR; GOOD-BYE DOLLY? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the circus procession of cloned sheep, cows, mice and
goats in the past couple years, humans seemed likely to join the
list soon. Now this sobering news: A cloned calf in France dropped
dead seven weeks after its birth.
</P>
<P>
   The calf appeared healthy until days before her death. She then
developed severe anemia and collapsed. An autopsy revealed a
withered thymus gland, where white blood cells mature, suggesting
that her immune system never started working.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Paul Renard of the National Institute for Agronomic
Research in Jouy-en-Josas, who cloned her, thinks a defective donor
cell might be at fault. He points out that the cloning process can
work fine _ other clones produced with his technique are thriving _
but concedes that 30 percent to 50 percent of cloned calves die
shortly before and immediately after birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want to apply this technique outside of research,''
Renard says, ``such a high rate of abortion and mortality will not
be acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Failure is actually the norm in the cloning business. Ryuzo
Yanagimachi at the University of Hawaii has had perhaps the
greatest success, producing five generations of cloned mice.
</P>
<P>
   Recently he created the first male clone, also a mouse. Yet
Yanagimachi and his team had to transplant 274 embryos just to
produce three live male mice, two of which died almost immediately.
That's not much of an improvement over the 276 failures that
preceded Dolly the sheep, the first mammal clone.
</P>
<P>
   There are other signs of trouble. The cloned mice were born with
mild breathing problems. More disturbing is that Dolly's
chromosomes are worn down at the edges, possibly showing signs of
premature aging.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear if she will die early. For now, she appears
healthy and has given birth to four lambs, also doing fine. But
Margaret Mellon of the Washington, D.C.-based Union of Concerned
Scientists warns: ``There are many things that could be seriously
wrong with her that would be very difficult to detect.''
</P>
<P>

 &UR; ROBO-DOC &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In their quest for kinder cutting, physicians increasingly rely
on endoscopic surgery, replacing large scalpels and clamps with
cameras and flexible tools that snake into the body through tiny
holes. The technique is far less traumatic for patients but
exhausting for the surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suppose I asked you to pick up a noodle from a plate,'' says
engineer Sunil Singh, ``but I put the plate inside a box with two
holes on top and asked you not just to go in and pick it up but to
cut and stitch it too.''
</P>
<P>
   Exasperated, Singh and his colleague John Wen of Endobotics and
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute developed Endobot, a robot that
can take over much of the mundane stitching and slicing during
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Endobot features two movable arms that have interchangeable
tools attached. Once the arms are in position, the surgeon flicks a
switch _ or in a future version, barks out an order _ and the tools
begin to cut, grasp, suture or drill. Those procedures are perfect
for hernia repair, gallstone removal and one day even heart
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``With our technology, the robot can synchronize its motion with
the heart and suture it while it's beating,'' Singh says.
</P>
<P>
   Endobot is expected to be used on humans in clinical trials this
fall.
</P>

 &UR; ASTEROIDS AMOK &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of all natural hazards facing us, an asteroid impact is
potentially the deadliest, and the most unpredictable. The latest
news is not heartening. Wyn Evans has discovered an asteroid belt
hovering just a few million miles beyond Earth's orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Most asteroids circle the sun in a wide band between the orbits
of Mars and Jupiter, but some nestle in zones of stability in the
outer solar system. Evans, a physicist at Oxford, wanted to see if
similar pockets of small asteroids could exist closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   Using a mathematical simulation running on 20 desktop computers,
he looked at the fates of imaginary objects plopped in orbits
between the sun and Mars. Gravity from a passing planet usually
swept the body from the solar system. But Evans found that
asteroids could survive for billions of years in orbits some 8
million to 30 million miles outside the orbit of Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Evans thinks there may be as many as 1,000 asteroids in this
near-Earth asteroid belt. He has already identified three
candidates. Although they generally stay in place, these objects
will occasionally get knocked loose by the gravity of Earth and
other planets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some danger,'' Evans says, ``because there are ways
to eject objects out of the belt. But any Earth-crossing asteroid
is potentially dangerous no matter where it came from.''
</P>
<P>
   -----
 &UR; BABY BIG BANGS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At least once a day, a brilliant flash of gamma rays appears
from a random direction. After a three-decade hunt, astronomers may
have tracked down the sources of these blasts of energetic,
invisible radiation. A pair of gas clouds in a nearby galaxy
appears to be the tortured remains of two ancient gamma-ray bursts.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Wang, an astrophysicist at Northwestern University, was
studying images of the Pinwheel galaxy, or M101, when he noticed
the two unusual objects. They looked like the remains of
supernovas, rare and powerful stellar explosions, but were far too
bright.
</P>
<P>
   Wang believes he has spotted the aftermath of hypernovas,
theoretical events in which dying stars blow off their outer layers
and collapse into black holes. They may be the fiercest blasts
since the beginning of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   When gamma-ray bursts were first detected by military satellites
in the 1960s, nobody knew where they came from. Scientists have
since deduced that they occur in the most distant corners of the
cosmos and have wondered what could possibly power them. Hypernovas
could do the trick. These explosions probably occur among young,
massive stars, so gamma-ray bursts may contain a hidden message
about how galaxies evolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the distribution of gamma-ray bursts, we may be able to
infer the history of star formation in the universe,'' Wang says.

   &UR; GOOD-BYE DOLLY? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the circus procession of cloned sheep, cows, mice and
goats in the past couple years, humans seemed likely to join the
list soon. Now this sobering news: A cloned calf in France dropped
dead seven weeks after its birth.
</P>
<P>
   The calf appeared healthy until days before her death. She then
developed severe anemia and collapsed. An autopsy revealed a
withered thymus gland, where white blood cells mature, suggesting
that her immune system never started working.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Paul Renard of the National Institute for Agronomic
Research in Jouy-en-Josas, who cloned her, thinks a defective donor
cell might be at fault. He points out that the cloning process can
work fine _ other clones produced with his technique are thriving _
but concedes that 30 percent to 50 percent of cloned calves die
shortly before and immediately after birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want to apply this technique outside of research,''
Renard says, ``such a high rate of abortion and mortality will not
be acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Failure is actually the norm in the cloning business. Ryuzo
Yanagimachi at the University of Hawaii has had perhaps the
greatest success, producing five generations of cloned mice.
</P>
<P>
   Recently he created the first male clone, also a mouse. Yet
Yanagimachi and his team had to transplant 274 embryos just to
produce three live male mice, two of which died almost immediately.
That's not much of an improvement over the 276 failures that
preceded Dolly the sheep, the first mammal clone.
</P>
<P>
   There are other signs of trouble. The cloned mice were born with
mild breathing problems. More disturbing is that Dolly's
chromosomes are worn down at the edges, possibly showing signs of
premature aging.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear if she will die early. For now, she appears
healthy and has given birth to four lambs, also doing fine. But
Margaret Mellon of the Washington, D.C.-based Union of Concerned
Scientists warns: ``There are many things that could be seriously
wrong with her that would be very difficult to detect.''
</P>

 &UR; ROBO-DOC &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In their quest for kinder cutting, physicians increasingly rely
on endoscopic surgery, replacing large scalpels and clamps with
cameras and flexible tools that snake into the body through tiny
holes. The technique is far less traumatic for patients but
exhausting for the surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suppose I asked you to pick up a noodle from a plate,'' says
engineer Sunil Singh, ``but I put the plate inside a box with two
holes on top and asked you not just to go in and pick it up but to
cut and stitch it too.''
</P>
<P>
   Exasperated, Singh and his colleague John Wen of Endobotics and
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute developed Endobot, a robot that
can take over much of the mundane stitching and slicing during
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Endobot features two movable arms that have interchangeable
tools attached. Once the arms are in position, the surgeon flicks a
switch _ or in a future version, barks out an order _ and the tools
begin to cut, grasp, suture or drill. Those procedures are perfect
for hernia repair, gallstone removal and one day even heart
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``With our technology, the robot can synchronize its motion with
the heart and suture it while it's beating,'' Singh says.
</P>
<P>
   Endobot is expected to be used on humans in clinical trials this
fall.
</P>

 &UR; ASTEROIDS AMOK &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of all natural hazards facing us, an asteroid impact is
potentially the deadliest, and the most unpredictable. The latest
news is not heartening. Wyn Evans has discovered an asteroid belt
hovering just a few million miles beyond Earth's orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Most asteroids circle the sun in a wide band between the orbits
of Mars and Jupiter, but some nestle in zones of stability in the
outer solar system. Evans, a physicist at Oxford, wanted to see if
similar pockets of small asteroids could exist closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   Using a mathematical simulation running on 20 desktop computers,
he looked at the fates of imaginary objects plopped in orbits
between the sun and Mars. Gravity from a passing planet usually
swept the body from the solar system. But Evans found that
asteroids could survive for billions of years in orbits some 8
million to 30 million miles outside the orbit of Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Evans thinks there may be as many as 1,000 asteroids in this
near-Earth asteroid belt. He has already identified three
candidates. Although they generally stay in place, these objects
will occasionally get knocked loose by the gravity of Earth and
other planets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some danger,'' Evans says, ``because there are ways
to eject objects out of the belt. But any Earth-crossing asteroid
is potentially dangerous no matter where it came from.''
</P>
<P>

 &UR; BABY BIG BANGS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At least once a day, a brilliant flash of gamma rays appears
from a random direction. After a three-decade hunt, astronomers may
have tracked down the sources of these blasts of energetic,
invisible radiation. A pair of gas clouds in a nearby galaxy
appears to be the tortured remains of two ancient gamma-ray bursts.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Wang, an astrophysicist at Northwestern University, was
studying images of the Pinwheel galaxy, or M101, when he noticed
the two unusual objects. They looked like the remains of
supernovas, rare and powerful stellar explosions, but were far too
bright.
</P>
<P>
   Wang believes he has spotted the aftermath of hypernovas,
theoretical events in which dying stars blow off their outer layers
and collapse into black holes. They may be the fiercest blasts
since the beginning of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   When gamma-ray bursts were first detected by military satellites
in the 1960s, nobody knew where they came from. Scientists have
since deduced that they occur in the most distant corners of the
cosmos and have wondered what could possibly power them. Hypernovas
could do the trick. These explosions probably occur among young,
massive stars, so gamma-ray bursts may contain a hidden message
about how galaxies evolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the distribution of gamma-ray bursts, we may be able to
infer the history of star formation in the universe,'' Wang says.

SOME CONVENIENCE CHECKS ARE JUST BAIT FOR CREDIT-CARD TRAP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA WEN and BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We know credit-card companies are in business to make money, but
sometimes they just go too far.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the case of Geoffrey B. Rosenberg, the president of a
South Boston auto and truck parts business. He is bright,
articulate and savvy when it comes to money, but even he didn't see
what was coming with his A T &AMP; T Universal Card.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg, 40, decided to buy a set of bookcases for $2,800 and
wanted to make his money go as far as possible. So he bought the
bookcases with his GE MasterCard, earning card benefits with the
purchase. He then used an A T &AMP; T convenience check, which he had
received in the mail, to pay off the GE balance.
</P>
<P>
   Convenience checks are a popular marketing tool in the
credit-card industry, choking mail boxes across the country on a
daily basis. The checks usually are used for balance transfers from
another credit card, but often can be tapped for any purchase. They
typically carry a low teaser interest rate that remains in effect
for a limited period of time.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg's A T &AMP; T convenience check carried a 4.9 percent
interest rate until February, well below the card's regular rate of
16.7 percent. The pitch letter that accompanied the convenience
check called it a ``practical financial tool we think you'll enjoy
using.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg, who says he closely read all the fine print
accompanying the check, figured he would use it as a bridge. He
planned to pay off the convenience check balance entirely by
February, incurring relatively small interest charges.
</P>
<P>
   In early July, he made his first payment of $379, designating
that $73 should go to pay off the existing, higher-interest-rate
balance on his card with the remainder to go toward the balance on
the convenience check.
</P>
<P>
   But when he got his statement the following month, Rosenberg
discovered that just the opposite had been done. The bulk of his
$379 had been applied to the convenience check balance, and only a
minimum payment had been made on the existing card balance, which
had ballooned during the month because of additional purchases.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the credit-card company was maximizing its revenues,
getting rid of the convenience check balance with the lower
interest rate as fast as possible while making sure Rosenberg paid
the higher rate on his existing balance as long as possible. The
only way he could get rid of the existing balance was to pay off
the entire convenience check balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like this albatross that's going to hang around your neck
forever,'' Rosenberg said. ``If more people understood what game
was being run on them, they'd be much more careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg cried foul, but company officials referred him to the
fine print of his credit-card contract. It said: ``We may allocate
payments to amounts owed on your account in the manner we deem
appropriate, including but not limited to, applying payments to
promotional balances, such as balance transfers, before applying
them to purchases and cash advances.''
</P>
<P>
   Most other credit-card companies use similar language in their
contracts. Some, such as Fleet Bank of Boston, spell out the terms
right in the convenience check offer.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Mindler, a spokeswoman for Citibank, which owns the A T &AMP;
T card, said the company chooses to retire the convenience check
balances first because the teaser rate expires fairly quickly. She
said the company doesn't want customers to be hit with a major
interest-rate increase.
</P>
<P>
   The helpful, Big Brother attitude doesn't ring true to us. The
reason the banks allocate payments to the lower-interest-rate
balances first is because that approach makes them the most money.
</P>
<P>
   ``He found a credit trap and fell into it,'' said Edgar Dworsky,
a consumer advocate, commenting on Rosenberg's plight. Dworsky said
the only way around the trap is to pay off all existing balances
before using a convenience check.
</P>
<P>
   Unwilling to become the credit-card industry's latest victim,
Rosenberg used a home equity line of credit to pay off both A T &AMP; T
balances and secure extra money for home repairs.
</P>
<P>
   He then cut up his credit card and sent it back to A T &AMP; T, a
bit poorer but wiser. ``There are six ways to Sunday to play with
credit cards,'' he said, ``but there are also lots of ways to get
burned.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Pitfalls of paying in advance
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More and more people pay for their funerals in advance, but some
recent cases in Massachusetts highlight some of the dangers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the Board of Registration in Funeral
Services suspended George Williams, who owns three funeral homes in
Arlington and Somerville, for five years for failing to honor
so-called preneed contracts clients had signed.
</P>
<P>
   In one of three instances cited by the board, a woman paid
$3,305 in 1991 to lock in prices for a casket, a burial plot at
Cambridge Cemetery and various funeral services. But when she died
in 1997, Williams allegedly took advantage of her brother's
unfamiliarity with the preneed contract to pad his pocket. He
convinced the brother a more expensive casket was needed, told him
another $1,400 was required to secure a burial plot at Cambridge
Cemetery and that more money was needed to pay for the funeral
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the suspension, the board ordered Williams to
notify all other clients with preneed contracts of his suspension
and allow them to transfer their contracts to other funeral homes.
Williams owns the Daniel F. O'Brien Funeral Home in Somerville and
the Berglund-Williams and the Berglund-Williams O'Brien Funeral
Homes in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate case, the board suspended the license of Toni L.
Bullock and shut down her Mattapan funeral home for failing to keep
adequate records of preneed contracts. Now her clients face the
task of trying to get their money back.
</P>
<P>
   Byron Blanchard, an official with the Memorial Society of
Boston, a consumer group, said the board's rare disciplinary
actions were a positive sign. But he said the cases illustrate the
risks of paying for funerals in advance. He noted the state has no
fund to guarantee preneed contracts and only one inspector to
watchdog its 700 funeral homes.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Carlson, in a book on how to make funeral arrangements,
said preneed contracts are great in concept but often not so good
in reality. ``It always pays to plan ahead, but it rarely pays to
pay ahead,'' she wrote.
</P>

   --A big plus of credit cards. After hearing a $1,000 refund tale
from a reader, we're reminded of the wisdom of using a credit card
for major purchases if possible. This past summer, a consumer tried
to return a $1,000 portable air conditioner when it failed to cool
down a room as promised. The unit was charged on his MasterCard.
The merchant balked at a full refund, but later issued a refund
minus a 20 percent (or $200) restocking fee. Still upset, our
reader wrote to MasterCard and invoked the federal government's
Regulation Z. This regulation (the details of which are on the back
of your credit-card statements) enables customers to withhold
payment if they believe a billing error has occurred or if they
dispute the quality of the goods or services received. The
credit-card issuer then investigates. In this case, MasterCard
ruled the Brookline man didn't have to pay the $200.
</P>
<P>
   --Spam clarification. After our column on ways to reduce junk
e-mail, also known as spam, a reader said we should have pointed
out that an Internet service provider can be unwittingly used, or
hijacked, by someone in a spamming scheme. He is right. The codes
in the e-mail message may reveal the spammer's ISP, but also may
indicate the name of an ISP that was an innocent intermediary in
delivering the message.

   But others see reason for enthusiasm. ``There is a risk of us
overselling the usefulness (of the genome), but one doesn't have to
do that, because it's going to be just terrific,'' said Victor
McKusick, the Johns Hopkins University biologist sometimes called
the father of genetic medicine. ``It's not going to come next year
or the year after that, but the coming century is going to be a
very exciting one of profiting from the available information from
the genome.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, information gleaned from the project has become a
valuable resource for thousands of medical researchers, including
many at Boston's hospitals and universities.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all big pharmaceutical companies have refocused their
drug-discovery processes around the new understanding of genes, and
some _ including Pfizer Inc., Amgen Inc., Bayer AG, and Merck &AMP; Co.
_ have set up shop in Boston or Cambridge or have plans to do so.
Together, the two cities are becoming known as ``Genetown.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 7,000 people are expected to visit Boston next March for a
biotechnology conference, making it the largest such conference
ever held, according to the Massachusetts Biotechnology Council,
which will host the event.
</P>
<P>
   The new genetic knowledge is also expected to add to the state's
base of 25,000 biotechnology jobs. Not only are companies likely to
spend millions of dollars on using it to develop medical
treatments, but they will likely hire workers and spend money to
sequence the DNA of hundreds of other organisms for the clues they
give to how human genes work. Moreover, the human genome will be
mapped again and again to find the small but significant
differences in the genetic code that make individuals vary.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be big changes,'' predicts Jonathan
Rothberg, president of the New Haven, Conn. biotech company
CuraGen. ``The human variations we discover and the associations we
make between human genes and disease will be the basis of medicine
for the next century.''
</P>
<P>
   There are several private companies trying to catalog all human
genes. One of them, Celera Genomics Group of Rockville, Md., says
that it will use a different technique than the Human Genome
Project to sequence human DNA and that it will finish the job two
years before the government's final version is done. However,
unlike the Human Genome Project, Celera will charge others a fee to
see most of its data.
</P>
<P>
   William Haseltine, chairman and chief executive of Human Genome
Sciences Inc., also of Rockville, says his company has already
catalogued 95 percent of the medically useful human genes. Instead
of scanning the chemical sequence of DNA, Haseltine's company found
genes by looking for the telltale signs they leave when they are
active within cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Human Genome Project sequence is completed, it will
be a rather meaningless footnote to a revolution that is well under
way,'' Haseltine said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, pharmaceutical companies are using genetic
research to streamline the creation of new drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, developing new drugs was an expensive and tedious
process of trial and error, taking many years and costing hundreds
of millions of dollars. Often the drugs were discovered haphazardly
through their effects on patients who took them for other reasons.
In other cases, it required time-consuming testing of thousands of
compounds, one at a time, in animals, says Robert Tepper, chief
scientific officer of Millennium Pharmaceuticals in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Now, companies like Millennium are developing techniques for
testing thousands of drugs at the same time. Those drugs can be
washed across tiny ``gene chips'' that contain hundreds or
thousands of genes taken from cells of healthy or ill people. All
these interactions are analyzed by computers that quickly report
which drugs had the desired effect on the genes.
</P>
<P>
   A perfect example of the new approach came in an announcement
last week from scientists at the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge
and Millennium Pharmaceuticals. They said they had identified a new
target for obesity therapy, a protein in the small intestine that
regulates how much fat from food is taken up into the body. Having
found that protein and the gene that causes it to be made, the
researchers will try to find a drug that blocks that process,
reducing fat uptake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drugs . . . will be more selective and less toxic, much more
geared to a specific type of a disease that you have,'' said
Tepper. Beyond this, he said, ``we will be able to offer patients
many many more tests that will help them predict their risks and
change their lifestyles'' to help them avoid diseases to which they
are genetically predisposed.
</P>
<P>
   Another goal of the genome project is identifying genetic
variations that dictate differences in the way humans respond to
drugs. The same drug may help some people but not others, and in
still others cause harmful side effects.
</P>
<P>
   In the not-too-distant future, people might be given a DNA test
at birth and then issued a small card or computer chip that
indicates what type of health problems they are likely to
encounter. The hope is that they would be able to make lifestyle
decisions and perhaps take new preventive drugs to forestall those
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, though, predictive tests will arrive before
preventions, creating dilemmas for patients and doctors. ``We are
going to be going through hell, because we'll learn a lot about
biology and physiology'' but there won't be immediate treatments,
said Collins, the genome project coordinator at the National
Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest effect of the genome project could come in cancer
treatment, in which many patients routinely receive chemotherapy
and other painful therapies with no benefit. By studying genes,
researchers are finding that what they thought was a single type of
cancer is really a family of genetically distinct diseases, each of
which might require a different treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Already, doctors are checking the genetic signature of a tumor
before recommending treatment. Breast cancer patients who have an
overabundance of a gene called HER2 now are often given Herceptin,
which blocks the gene and prevents it from overproducing a protein
that prompts tumors to spread quickly. If HER2 is not overabundant,
the woman is not a candidate for Herceptin.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the work is aimed at finding new treatments for
cancer. If researchers could figure out which genes are involved,
they could fashion drugs, like Herceptin, to block a particular
gene or to spur a gene to become more active.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cancer has been a black box,,'' said Dr. Richard Klausner,
director of the National Cancer Institute. ``It's been hard to know
what's going on inside and how to fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   Studying the genes that cause cancer ``has been like switching
on the lights,'' Klausner said. ``It's that dramatic.''

<P>
   Scientists using the most powerful computers ever brought to
bear on human biology are within months of completing a first
reading of the genetic ``Book of Life,'' the information coded in
DNA that says why one person looks and acts differently than
another, why some are more prone to fall sick, and what exactly
goes awry in the body when that happens.
</P>
<P>
   This work, underway in laboratories from Cambridge to Tokyo, is
almost certain to ignite a revolution in medicine in the early 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
   Such knowledge should help doctors and researchers understand
more about disease: what causes a child to develop cancer, a
teenager to have schizophrenia, and an older person to be stricken
by Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   And if researchers' highest hopes are met, knowledge of the
human DNA code will help scientists fashion novel treatments for
nearly every human ailment.
</P>
<P>
   Already the new genetic information is fueling a boom in
pharmaceutical and biotechnology research. The Kendall Square area
of Cambridge, Mass. _ next door to the Whitehead Institute at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a key node in the
government-sponsored Human Genome Project _ has become a magnet for
companies working on gene-based diagnostic tools and treatments.
They are expected to become increasingly important in the regional
economy.
</P>
<P>
   By spring, the Human Genome Project will have produced a rough
draft of the human genome, what some scientists refer to as the
``Book of Life,'' the basic instructions for operating the human
body. The complete text of all human DNA will be posted on the
Internet for anyone to use.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be the most important step we've taken in science,''
said James Watson, who helped launch the new era of genetics nearly
50 years ago by discovering, with Francis Crick, the structure of
deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got our instruction book: how to build the 747,'' Watson
said. ``We can't read it all yet. But that we've evolved to where
we can have the book, that's pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists involved in the genome project say they are building
a kind of public infrastructure that will fuel a boom in medical
research, just as the interstate highway system laid the groundwork
for the nation's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Their work will prove to be more important than splitting the
atom or putting a man on the moon, said Dr. Francis Collins, a
geneticist at the National Institutes of Health who acts as
coordinator of the Human Genome Project.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to change the way medicine is practiced, and it
will forever alter the way biological and medical research is
done,'' Collins said. It could bring new treatments for every
single human disease, he added.
</P>
<P>
   DNA is carried by every person, in the heart of almost every
cell. It is made up of four chemicals linked in a huge chain
estimated at 3 billion chemicals in length. Mapping it all has been
a decade-long task involving thousands of scientists in
laboratories around the world. The rough draft of the human genome
will list the order of all 3 billion chemicals, but it may contain
some errors. A final version is expected in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   With the genome text in hand, Collins and others say,
researchers will be able to find all the estimated 80,000 to
140,000 human genes, or segments of DNA that tell cells how to
function. Finding the genes and understanding their work in the
body will allow scientists to develop medical treatments that
attack disease at its root cause.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors hope one day to replace the faulty genes responsible for
illnesses like cystic fibrosis. New drugs that make some genes more
active and others less active may treat hypertension, obesity, and
heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   By studying genes more closely, researchers should deepen their
understanding of human behavior and mental illnesses such as
schizophrenia and manic-depressive disorder. By analyzing a
person's genes, doctors might be able to diagnose an illness long
before the patient develops symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   But some see risks. Just as the World War II-era Manhattan
Project brought the risk of nuclear war to an unprepared world, the
human genome project could give scientists potent genetic tools
before society has sorted out their implications.
</P>
<P>
   As scientists fashion new treatments for cancer or obesity by
manipulating genes, they may also learn how to alter the genes that
control traits such as height, athleticism, or intelligence.
Scientists have already reported manipulating genes to make
laboratory mice ``smarter'' and ``more sociable.'' That leaves
society to face questions about which traits should be changed,
which left alone, and who should have power to decide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even those of us who don't take Genesis literally see a vast
mystery in the origin of our species and in each of our
destinies,'' said Ronald Green, a Dartmouth College professor who
served as an ethicist to the Human Genome Project.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, we are learning how to change, almost at will, the
blueprint for building a human being. ``We can fashion new life
forms; we are already doing that,'' Green said. ``Some of us see us
taking the evolution of our species into our own hands.''
</P>
<P>
   As scientists learn to diagnose diseases by analyzing genes, the
public will have to decide what to do with the knowledge. Should a
7-year-old be told that she may develop breast cancer at age 35 or
Alzheimer's at age 70? Should her insurance company know? What if
there were no steps she could take to cut her risk?
</P>
<P>
   US law allows companies to patent genes, but some critics argue
that the genome is a natural human resource that shouldn't be
licensed to anyone exclusively. Critics also fear that putting so
much emphasis on the importance of genes could lead people into
extreme ``genetic determinism'' _ the notion that most human
activity is dictated by genes _ and prompt discrimination based on
peoples' DNA.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Genes are small sections of DNA scattered throughout the genome
that tell cells how to handle the daily tasks of life, such as
reproducing, fighting illness, and communicating with other cells.
They tell an embryo how to turn into a fetus and a child how to
turn into an adult. Specifically, each gene tells the cells how to
build a protein, and proteins, in turn, are the agents that do work
in the body.
</P>
<P>
   Many illnesses can be traced to a flawed gene or set of genes,
which produce a faulty protein or too much or too little of a
protein. In fact, nearly every illness seems to have a genetic
component, even those in which a person's behavior or living
conditions clearly play a role. Why does one french fry-lover
develop clogged arteries while another doesn't? Why does one
asbestos factory worker develop cancer while another remains
healthy? At least in part, scientists say, the answer is in the
genes.
</P>
<P>
   It will take decades to find all the genes and learn how they
function in the body and interact with each other.So far, progress
has been slow. Even knowing which genes are responsible for cystic
fibrosis, muscular dystrophy, sickle cell anemia, and many other
illnesses, scientists have not come up with cures. Gene therapy,
the attempt to replace faulty genes with new ones, has still to
prove successful after more than two decades of research.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really bothers me is the hype going along with these
projects, giving the sense that cures are just around the corner,''
said Jonathan Beckwith, a Harvard microbiologist and an advisory
board member of the Council for Responsible Genetics in Cambridge.

DEFLATING THE MYTH OF AGE-RELATED WEIGHT GAIN 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like most elders struggling with a weight problem, 74-year-old
Ira Phillips was once slim.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty years ago, when her twins were born, Phillips carried 125
pounds on her 5-foot-5 frame. Back then, her ``body mass index'' or
BMI, a measure that takes height and weight into account, was an
enviably healthy 21. (Anything over 25 is considered overweight,
and over 27 counts as obese.)
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, though, the pounds crept up until, earlier this
year, Phillips reached. . . well, she doesn't like to say, but it
was more than 200 pounds. That gave her a dangerously high BMI of
35, along with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Age-related weight gain is so common that most consider it a
veritable law of nature. But is it?
</P>
<P>
   Less than most may assume, according to the best emerging
evidence. Some effects of aging on weight gain are unavoidable, but
it appears those are dwarfed by factors that virtually all of us
can influence if we choose to _ how much we eat and, especially,
the amount and type of exercise we get.
</P>
<P>
   Weight gain is fundamentally a matter of metabolism: the process
by which the body converts the calories in food to energy. And by
far the most important determinant of weight gain is basal
metabolism _ the rate at which we burn calories while sitting at
rest. Surprisingly, resting metabolism accounts for about
two-thirds of our total energy expenditure.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody's basal metabolism slows down with age. In general,
the resting metabolic rate of men sags 2 to 3 percent per decade,
beginning around age 35, says Prof. Eric Poehlman, a metabolism
expert at the University of Vermont. Women have a somewhat lower
metabolic rate to begin with, he adds, but it doesn't drop much
until menopause, when the loss of estrogen somehow results in an
accelerated decline.
</P>
<P>
   The basal metabolic rate of an average 60-year-old is about 200
calories a day lower than a typical 30-year-old's.
</P>
<P>
   Even small declines in metabolic rate add up, in terms of added
poundage, because the balance between food intake and energy
expenditure is so exquisitely sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Metabolic control is extremely tightly regulated in the
body,'' says Dr. Ronenn Roubenoff, an expert on metabolism at the
Tufts University-US Department of Agriculture Human Nutrition
Research Center and New England Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``A theoretical 155-pound man, our average Joe, eats about a
million calories a year and burns about a million calories a
year,'' Roubenoff notes. ``To gain a pound a year, you only have to
be off by 10,000 calories _ only a one percent variance. So if you
think about it, to gain a pound you only have to eat 27 calories a
day more than you burn. That's a fraction of a cookie!''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if you want to lose weight, Roubenoff adds,
you only have to shave a few calories every day from your diet _ or
increase your daily calorie ``burn.''
</P>
<P>
   As every dieter knows, it is supremely difficult to lose weight
and keep it off by restricting calories alone, thanks to humans'
inborn drive to eat whatever is available. But food intake is just
half the story. Scientists are beginning to focus much more on the
other side of the metabolic equation: energy expenditure.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say the normal slowing of metabolism with advancing
age is not the main problem. It's the reduction of physical
activity with age, and the accompanying loss of lean muscle mass,
that's the real culprit. It means that, even without eating more
calories, more of what people of a certain age eat will be
deposited as fat _ mostly around the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Ira Phillips is a case in point. Her major weight gain did not
occur, she says, until after age 62, when she retired from her job
as a clerical worker with the Boston School Department. ``When you
retire you change your life,'' she says. ``You're not as active.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not a simple matter of burning more calories through
physical activity, although that's part of it. More important,
researchers say, is the gradual loss of lean muscle mass that
occurs throughout middle and old age.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this is inevitable _ even older masters-class athletes
who train hard lose some muscle mass as they age _ but the trend is
greatly accelerated by most Americans' sedentary lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   The reason muscle loss is so important: The amount of lean
muscle humans have is the most important determinant of their
resting metabolic rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest reasons why the way we burn calories slows
down is that we lose muscle as we age,'' Poehlman says. ``It's a
vicious cycle. You lose muscle mass, you become less active,
inactivity leads to more muscle loss. Even though older people
generally eat fewer calories, they're burning disproportionately
fewer calories.''
</P>
<P>
   Lean muscle is so important in metabolism because it's the
biggest ``sponge'' for soaking up glucose, the simple sugar that is
the body's source of all energy. The less lean muscle someone has,
the greater her likelihood of excess blood sugar.
</P>
<P>
   And what happens to excess glucose? Our bodies efficiently store
it away as fat _ a hedge against a time of starvation that, for
most people these days, never comes.
</P>
<P>
   To make things worse, the fat people accumulate in middle age is
much more likely to be the worst kind, metabolically speaking:
abdominal fat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fat in the stomach is very different biochemically than on the
arms or thighs,'' says Poehlman. ``It's more metabolically active,
which means it breaks down more readily, putting more fat into the
bloodstream.'' That interferes with glucose metabolism and the
action of insulin, the hormone that enables cells to use glucose
for energy.
</P>
<P>
   There is a powerful evolutionary reason behind the way humans
store fat. Our prehistoric ancestors evolved to cope with periods
of food scarcity. ``That programmed our whole metabolism,'' notes
Prof. Susan Roberts, a Tufts metabolism expert.
</P>
<P>
   To get through the lean times, Roberts explains, humans
developed a complex system of chemical signals between body and
brain that strongly impel us to eat when we can to preserve fat
stores. Her research suggests that some of these signals ``go
haywire'' with age, as she puts it, disabling the controls of
appetite and energy expenditure that tend to maintain a stable
weight at younger ages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just beginning to learn about this system in man,'' says
Prof. Jules Hirsch of Rockefeller University. Only four years ago,
Rockefeller scientists caused a great stir with their discovery of
leptin, a hormone secreted by fat cells. Too little leptin in the
blood apparently warns the brain that starvation is imminent. The
message: Eat more!
</P>
<P>
   Initially, many researchers (and drug companies) thought that
giving fat people leptin would suppress appetite and promote weight
loss. But it hasn't turned out to be that simple. The control of
food intake and energy expenditure ``is going to be a very ornate
mechanism, with lots of little arrows and controls and lots of
redundant loops,'' Hirsch says.
</P>
<P>
   The emerging complexity of this appetite-driving mechanism tells
researchers it's going to be difficult to override. Although we
punish ourselves and others with accusations of gluttony and moral
failing, in reality it is this inborn drive to eat
``opportunistically'' that accounts for the epidemic of obesity and
associated diseases, such as diabetes, that afflicts all developed
nations and many developing nations as well.

80-YEAR-OLD RETIREE SHOULD EASE INTO STOCK MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My husband and I are 41 and 38, respectively. We have $82,000
in a IRA with $11,300 in International Growth fund, $21,000 in
Vanguard Wellesley, $18,500 in Vanguard Windsor II, $15,200 in
Vanguard High-Yield Bond fund, and $16,000 in the Vanguard Prime
Money Market fund. We also have another traditional IRA invested in
Janus fund, consisting of $2,800. We don't add to either of these
accounts, as they were rolled over from a previous employer's
profit-sharing plan. My husband currently buys $100 a month worth
of his company's stock, and next year he will become eligible for
its 401(k). At that point he will stop buying stock and begin to
contribute $200 a month, with his employer matching with an
additional $50 a month. The only plan where I work is a
deferred-compensation plan, to which I contribute the minimum
amount, representing 7 percent of my salary or $1,000 a year, all
invested in an income fund that usually provides a return of about
6 percent. We have negligible credit card debt and owe about
$109,000 on our mortgage, which has 22 years left. I can probably
manage to save another $200 per month. If we retire at age 65, will
we be in tough shape?
</P>
<P>
   N.R., Foxborough, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Probably not. I'll have to base my response on some rough
estimates, since you didn't supply the current value of either your
husband's shares of his company's stock or the current balance in
your 401(k).
</P>
<P>
   But based only on the current balances in your IRAs and your
husband's anticipated contributions to the 401(k) and your ongoing
contributions to the deferred-compensation plan, you would amass
$1,205,504 over 24 years. If such a sum were invested (at a
presumed fixed-income rate of 6.5 percent) you might expect an
annual income stream of $78,357.
</P>
<P>
   That may sound pretty grand, but after you adjust it to an
estimated annual inflation rate of 3.5 percent during those 24
years, it would have the buying power of about $34,500 in today's
money.
</P>
<P>
   If you were able to add a further $200 a month to your
contributions to the deferred-compensation plan, the accumulation
would be $1,427,654. Under the same assumption, you might then
invest it to provide an income stream of $92,797, equivalent to
about $40,500 in today's dollars.
</P>
<P>
   There are two problems with those projections. Both of the
growth estimates were made using an estimate of 10 percent for
average annual investment returns.
</P>
<P>
   To have a reasonable chance of achieving such a return, both you
and your husband should be investing your savings more
aggressively. Certainly the money market holding in your IRA should
be swapped for a stock fund such as Vanguard Index 500.
</P>
<P>
   I'd also lean toward exchanging the High-Yield Corporate Bond
position for a stock fund, but I'd probably wait for its price to
recover a bit before making that move.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in your deferred-compensation plan you should be
looking for long-term growth rather than current income, and thus
should be invested in whatever stock vehicles are available.
</P>
<P>
   The second problem is that you shouldnt rely entirely on those
income projections I made, since once you retire you will want to
leave some of your money in growth securities, designed to protect
you against the effects of inflation during the later years of your
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   So if you want to be prudent, you might project that you'll have
a level that represents 75 percent to 80 percent of the various
income streams _ provided of course that you are willing to invest
more aggressively now and ride through the inevitable market bumps
of the next quarter century.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. We recently acquired two Vanguard Variable annuities, with 13
percent of the funds in its Money Market, 15 percent in the
Equity-Income, 19 percent in the High-Grade Bond, 31 percent in the
Balanced, and 22 percent in the High-Yield Bond accounts. The total
value of the accounts was $296,284 on June 30. A brief profile of
our situation: We are able to sustain our lifestyle on our pension
income only. In addition to the annuities, we have approximately
$115,000 in other investments, mostly funds. We own our home, worth
approximately $300,000, and have no foreseeable need of the money
in the annuities. We have both been retired since the early '80s.
My concern is that I am afraid we have too much invested in bonds _
40 percent not including the bond portfolio in the balanced fund,
and 53 percent if that is included. I am thinking we should reduce
the High-Yield and High-Grade bond accounts and move it into Equity
Income, Equity Index, and Growth accounts. What's your thinking?
</P>
<P>
   J.S., Escondido, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. This one threw me for a few minutes, because I tend to lump
money-market holdings with bonds to represent the fixed-income side
of a portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   So before I put the portfolio on a spreadsheet, I thought that
53 percent bonds meant 47 percent stocks, and that looked pretty
good to me for a person who has been retired for nearly two
decades. But after I got the numbers down, I began to agree with
you: Some more stock might be nice _ but not too much.
</P>
<P>
   You're not specific on the point, but let's guess that you're in
your early 80s. Even though you have no foreseeable need of the
money in the annuity accounts, holding a majority of this money in
stock funds is probably too aggressive for your situation.
</P>
<P>
   This is a point of view that I would likely take in a neutral
stock market. Since I view the current stock market as dangerously
exposed to a downturn, and perhaps a substantial downturn, I'm not
enthusiastic about wholesale changes.
</P>
<P>
   But I do think you might move a little money. Since you have no
foreseeable need for these funds, I suggest you jettison the 13
percent that's in the money-market account.
</P>
<P>
   If I were making the move, I'd put about half of this in the
Equity Index account and divide the balance between the Small
Company and International accounts, which would give you better
portfolio diversification. And this move would take you to that 47
percent equities that I liked at the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My two daughters have each received gifts of $6,000, which I
would like to set aside for college. My older child will graduate
in the year 2002 and the younger in 2005. Since there isn't an
abundance of time until graduation, I am willing to take at least a
moderate risk. What would be the best investment choice for their
money, and would it make sense to invest it separately or keep the
$12,000 together? We have also saved a total of $29,000 for them,
all invested in zero coupon US Treasury securities. Am I correct
that the funds should not be in their names because we will be
applying for financial aid?
</P>
<P>
   V.R., Walpole, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, if you need or think your child may be eligible for
financial aid, it is best to save college money in your own name.
But you also have to follow the rules.
</P>
<P>
   If you have built the zero-coupon bond accounts in your name,
fine. But if you started out with the money in the children's
names, you can't switch back. The same applies to the gifts that
your daughters have received.
</P>
<P>
   If the money was given to them with the direction that it be
used for their education, I don't see how you can avoid putting it
in their names. On the other hand, if it was given to you with the
understanding that it will be used for the girls' education, you're
in fine shape. Keep it in your name and their chances for financial
aid will be enhanced.
</P>
<P>
   As for an appropriate investment, you and I disagree completely.
</P>
<P>
   You write that since there isn't a lot of time until graduation,
you're willing to take at least a moderate risk. I think that the
shorter the time span, the lower the risk level you should be
willing to assume.
</P>
<P>
   If I'm reading your letter correctly, the elder daughter is
already in college, and the younger will follow in two years. The
money for your eldest daughter will be spent within three years,
and that of your younger daughter within two to six years.
</P>
<P>
   These savings should be in secure instruments such as money
market funds, CDs, short-term government securities, or _ at the
most risky _ a good short-term bond fund.

REGIME WITHIN A REGIME: ISRAEL'S ISLAMISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALIZA MARCUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KAFR KANA, Israel _ When Sheik Kamal Khatib wants to take stock
of his growing domain, all he has to do is to step outside his
mosque in this small Arab town in northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Across the garbage-strewn street is the free Islamic nursery
school, where children fingerpaint and play with dolls, under
pictures of the revered al-Aksa Mosque in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs is the town's only library, with shelves and shelves of
books, most of them related to the religion of Islam, wide wooden
work tables, and two computers that students can use, without fee.
</P>
<P>
   Down the road is the health clinic, where residents get
treatment along with a dose of religious respect.
</P>
<P>
   It is all provided by Khatib's Islamic Movement, a vibrant
organization with roots in almost every Arab town in Israel. And
Israeli Arabs are turning to the group to counter decades of
neglect and discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   But after four Israeli Arabs, linked to the Islamic Movement,
tried this month to set off bombs in nearby Tiberias and Haifa, the
Israeli government has asked whether the group might have other
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The question has been posed in many countries in the Middle
East, most recently in Turkey and Egypt, where Islamic
fundamentalist groups have found easy support among the alienated
poor, then have been accused of trying to overthrow the government
to set up religious rule.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, the issue is more complicated because the loyalties
of the bombers, the first Israeli Arabs to attempt such an attack,
are still unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Were the young men working for Hamas, the militant Islamic
group, which is based in the Palestinian-ruled parts of Gaza and
the West Bank? Or was the action incited by radicals within the
Israel-based Islamic Movement, which has condemned the attempted
bombings?
</P>
<P>
   Israeli authorities allege that Hamas, which opposes the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process, recruited two of the four men
involved in the failed attempts to bomb buses on Sept. 5. But they
also allege that some people within the Islamic Movement, like
Khatib, indirectly supported the attacks through speeches or
articles that incited followers to act against Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The attackers, along with another young Israeli Arab man who in
August killed two Israeli Jewish hikers, ``listened to the Islamic
Movement,'' said Gideon Ezra, former head of Israel's internal
security agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't do it because they are crazy, but because they
believed this country should be an Islamic state,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Islamic Movement officials disagree, and have urged Israel not
to blame all Muslims for what a few individuals did.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have reached tens of thousands of people through our
programs, and only four people were involved in the bombing attack.
Why are they accusing the whole Islamic movement?'' Khatib asked as
he sat in his office, with a photo of the local soccer team behind
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have two principles,'' Khatib said, ``we follow Sharia and
we follow Israeli law, and each person decides for himself whether
to operate inside or outside this, but if he steps outside of the
principles he does not represent the Islamic Movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli security services are not so sure. The Cabinet will soon
debate a list of measures aimed at curbing the influence of what
Israeli security officials say are the group's radical elements.
The movement has two factions, and Khatib belongs to what Israeli
officials say is the extremist wing.
</P>
<P>
   Possible measures include shutting down the movement's illegal
TV station, closing its unlicensed college and barring Khatib and
another leader from visiting the West Bank and Gaza. Some
politicians want the entire group dismantled.
</P>
<P>
   But Sammy Smooha, an Israeli Jewish expert on terrorism, said
the fears may be overstated and that the terrorists might have been
isolated members of the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear the bombers were members of the Islamic Movement,
but from hard-line statements made you can get the feeling that we
have to do something very drastic or we will have widespread
terrorism in Israel,'' Smooha said.
</P>
<P>
   He and others suggested the bombing reaction by Israeli
hard-liners reflects the belief that Arabs cannot be trusted in the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   Arab citizens do not serve in the army and they are rarely hired
in so-called sensitive industries such as the electric company.
They face widespread discrimination in getting building permits or
their share of public funding.
</P>
<P>
   Related to this is the question of whether the inequality
between Arabs and Jews in Israel somehow sparked the young men to
attempt the extremist act, which could have killed dozens of Arab
and Jewish Israelis alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can't be any justification for this, we condemn this
absolutely,'' said Osama Salah, a cousin of the one bomber who
survived the explosions, Ibrahim Salah, 20 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Osama Salah is deputy mayor in the town of Mash'had, where three
of the four bombers lived: Ibrahim Salah, who was about to start
college in Haifa and is now in custody; Amir Masalha, 25, newly
married and a former mosque preacher; and Krayem Nazal, 27.
</P>
<P>
   Mash'had, a five-minute drive from Kafr Kana, is a pretty town
in Galilee's green hills, but it lacks the services of a Jewish
town _ sidewalks, public parks, community centers, street signs.
Also missing is a sense that things will change.
</P>
<P>
   ``To make sure these things don't happen again we need to make
sure that there is real equality, that equal services are given to
the people and the towns _ it's not a justification for what
happened, but maybe it's one of the reasons,'' Osama Salah said.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``The problem is that these boys didn't lack for
anything, they all had work, futures, they were victims of
something.''

SOME EUROPEAN CABINET CHOICES SEEM IMPROBABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   LONDON _ Having endured Chris Patten's endless lectures about
the virtues of democracy, the Chinese were glad to see the backside
of Patten after the last British governor of Hong Kong handed the
territory back to them two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But when Chinese officials sit down for sensitive talks to forge
closer relations with the European Union, they will find themselves
sitting directly across from Chris Patten.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh from his 15-month review of policing in Northern Ireland,
Patten said he relishes his new job as chief of foreign affairs for
the European Union, and the spirit behind his appointment and that
of several others who, by previous standards, have been given
improbable assignments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are changing in Europe,'' Patten said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Patten is one of 19 commissioners appointed by the new European
Commission president, Romano Prodi, who with his 19-member Cabinet
was confirmed on Wednesday by the European Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest priority for Prodi and the 19 others who form the
executive branch of the 15-nation European Union is to improve the
commission's tarnished image after the forced resignations of their
predecessors last spring over allegations of mismanagement and
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   But Prodi, the former Italian prime minister, has chucked
conventional wisdom to the wind by appointing people, like Patten,
to positions that force the commissioner's native country to
confront issues it would rather avoid.
</P>
<P>
   Saddled by record unemployment and fearful that a new influx of
immigrant workers from the east will make things worse, the Germans
are the most squeamish about enlarging the EU. Prodi has put a
German, Gunter Verheugen, in charge of overseeing enlargement.
</P>
<P>
   As the recent protests against American trade sanctions and
attacks on McDonald's franchises in France underscore, the French
are the Europeans most vociferously opposed to liberalizing trade.
Prodi has put a Frenchman, Pascal Lamy, in charge of trade.
</P>
<P>
   According to Patten, this is part of Prodi's vision for
confronting the things that divide Europeans. There has been a
tendency in the past for European leaders to deliver flowery
speeches about the remarkable achievement of bringing together
nations that had spent much of the millennium fighting each other.
It has been less common to dwell on lingering disputes the European
partners have with each other, such as French opposition to free
trade and British skepticism about the wisdom of surrendering
national sovereignty to build European-wide institutions.
</P>
<P>
   David O'Sullivan, Prodi's top aide, said Prodi is determined to
make European policy less parochial. In the past, the Cabinet
staffs tended to be from the commissioner's native country. Prodi
has ordered his commissioners to mix their staffs with different
nationalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to have a truly European outlook,'' said
O'Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   Patten, for one, thinks it's a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives you a different perspective,'' he said. ``If I were
surrounded just by Brits, I wouldn't necessarily see things the way
the French or the Italians do.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if his staff comes from countries that think
enlargement is a good thing, can Verheugen soften German opposition
to enlargement, especially now that the Greeks have dropped their
opposition to Turkey's joining the EU?
</P>
<P>
   Germany is already home to millions of Turks, and EU membership
would entitle millions more to go to Germany in search of work.
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's efforts to reduce Germany's debt has
been rewarded with a precipitous drop in his popularity and
thrashings for his Social Democratic Party in three recent state
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Lamy may have an even more difficult task, getting French
farmers to temper their opposition to free trade. It has been the
willingness of Jose Bove, leader of a small farmer's union, to
crusade against free trade rather than Lamy's mission to end
damaging trade wars that has captured the public's imagination in
much of France.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of Patten, meanwhile, brings more to the
European Commission than a seasoned diplomat. Officials both at the
European Commission and 10 Downing St. said Patten could help ease
British skepticism about further European integration.
</P>
<P>
   The British have long been reluctant Europeans. Of the four EU
countries that did not take part in the launch this year of a
single European currency, opposition to the euro is strongest in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   While France and Germany have been the traditional leaders of
the European Union, Prime Minister Tony Blair has said he wants
Britain to take a leading role. Officials in both Brussels and
London hope that Patten's prominent role as Europe's foreign
minister will show there are benefits that offset what most Britons
consider the downside of turning over control of monetary policy to
the European Central Bank.

 ROUGHING IT, '90s STYLE  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH DALEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDHOEK, Namibia _ New Hampshire software consultant Tom Doyle
refuses to spend more than $10 a night for a dorm bed in a hostel,
but he has no qualms about dropping $60 for dinner with a bottle of
dry white wine.
</P>
<P>
   It is a strange pattern of extreme economy and top-of-the-line
luxury that Doyle, 36, has created during a nine-month independent
tour of Africa: He hauls around a muck-covered blue canvas
knapsack, but inside are a pair of shiny black wingtips, a gold
tie, and dress pants for nights out.
</P>
<P>
   Once, Doyle would have been an anomaly; a richer, older outcast
in a rite of passage that lures thousands of twentysomethings to
see the world as completely and cheaply as possible between college
and career.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, Doyle often finds himself sharing a dorm room _
and perhaps a cognac _ with those his own age who are taking a
travel break during careers rather than before them. Hostel owners
say they are seeing a marked increase in the number of Americans,
Australians, and Europeans in their 30s and 40s backpacking through
Asia and Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The shift has led budget guidebooks to introduce pricier
categories, and hostel owners to create more private rooms for the
older, fussier traveler.
</P>
<P>
   These moves have brought new tensions to the adventure of the
backpacker trail.
</P>
<P>
   Younger, more traditional backpackers say the sense of community
they cherish in hostels is being lost as the richer backpackers use
the accommodations only to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``These new backpackers can take away from the communal aspect
of what these backpacker hostels started out as,'' complained
Lauren Robers, manager of Whale House Backpackers in Hout Bay, near
Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, she said, backpackers used the hostels as a
one-stop social outlet: An inexpensive place to sleep and meet
travelers from around the world to share adventures and traveling
tips. Meals are often cooked communally and conversations about
local customs and culture stretch long into the night. But older
backpackers, she said, often rent cars and flash credit cards to
ditch the hostel and fellow tourists for camel safaris or white
linen wine-tasting evenings in Cape Town's excellent wine regions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The double rooms people are building defeat the object of the
backpackers; the dorm rooms get people talking to each other,'' she
said. ``It's sort of a fight in the industry now. You can lose the
whole concept of the hostel. We try to keep it pure here.''
</P>
<P>
   The new backpackers say they want that same purity _ without the
same price restrictions. Doyle, the software consultant who
hitchhiked from a central South African town to Namibia with an
African family, spent one night sleeping in a car, another in his
tent, and the next in a four-star hotel in Cape Town. Still a
little dusty from the sandstorms that whip across the Namib Desert,
he said his trip was too valuable to scrimp on the luxuries when he
occasionally craved them.
</P>
<P>
   ``But at the same time I want reality, and it's not in these big
hotels. It took me my entire life to get to this trip, and I'm not
going to count pennies, although I do have to be careful,'' said
Doyle, lounging in his eight-person dorm room at the Cardboard Box
hostel in Windhoek. There for one night, he was searching for a
ride to Botswana.
</P>
<P>
   As people marry later, make more money earlier, and switch
careers more often, many are tapping into savings to have an
extended adventure before going back to the grind. Moreover,
companies that value their employees are bowing to their workers'
wanderlust by granting travel sabbaticals.
</P>
<P>
   Those travel patterns are being catered to by on-the-cheap
guidebooks that increasingly are giving more expensive options to
the more grown-up market. Lonely Planet guidebooks, which started
out by giving backpackers in the 1970s advice on how to travel in
foreign countries on shoestring budgets, now give accommodation and
restaurant advice from ``bottom end'' to ``top end'' which can mean
$150-plus per night room rates and $90 dinners.
</P>
<P>
   ``More of our challenge now is getting younger users to use our
books,'' said Carolyn Miller, marketing director of Lonely Planet
guides for the United States and Asia. ``Some people may be able to
afford a little something more . . . that's why we offer the
different options, but many still want that backpacker community
feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   These new travelers reject American chain hotels and higher-end
organized luxury tours, opting instead for the rough-and-real,
dormitory-style experience offered by youth hostels.
</P>
<P>
   Hostels, which now accept guests of any age, may not always have
hot running water or private rooms, but guests are virtually
guaranteed interesting conversation over coffee with like-minded
adventurers from Manhattan to Melbourne. The trade-off in comfort
is more than made up for in experience: These travelers would
rather spend big money on river-rafting than room service.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a trip like this, when you are older, you don't have to
totally scrimp. But you do have to choose your priorities on where
you want to spend your money,'' said Carrie Svingen of Somerville,
who left last month for an eight-month backpacking tour of
Indonesia and Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   A self-employed publicist in her mid-30s, Svingen went to
Indonesia last year for several weeks and fell in love with it. She
then sublet her apartment, asked her mother to mail her monthly
bill payments, let clients know she will return in mid-2000, and
boarded a plane. ``I didn't have a lot of responsibilities or
encumbrances, it was the right time to fulfill a dream,'' Svingen
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hostel owners are taking advantage of the increase in older
travelers and their occasional desire for a slightly nicer room. In
Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, the Shoestrings hostel still sees plenty
of young travelers, but is building and renovating single and
double rooms for slightly older travelers that may go for $13 a
night instead of $8.
</P>
<P>
   Catching rays of a late African sun on Shoestring's porch
recently, Simon Carles, 23, of London, said he has noticed the
communal kitchen at Shoestrings to be empty at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are older people here and they have their own way of
doing things,'' Carles, traveling for three months through South
Africa and Zimbabwe. ``I'm used to meeting people and learning
about who they are and where they've been. It still happens, but I
notice it's not as much.''
</P>
<P>
   Many older backpackers say the hostels still offer the communal
concept and international culture they seek. An occasional splurge
doesn't take away from that feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get more of the culture in the hostels, people talk to
each other,'' said Wayne Bonnett, 34, an accountant from New
Zealand. He and his fiancee, Rianne Joziasse, 28, of Holland,
traveled for eight months through southern Africa before being
married several weeks ago in Fiji.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle said he needs the hostel to both support the length of
time he is traveling, and his need to meet other travelers and have
the most cultural experience he can find.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't afford, and don't want, the luxury tour. This way I
have it all. I've had the most amazing time.''

HOW CAN LATINO VIEWERS GET THEIR SCREENS TO BROWN? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A coalition of Latino organizations, determined to show network
execs they can't take us for granted anymore, called on the
country's 31 million Latinos to boycott TV for two weeks, to
denounce what they called a ``TV Brown-out.''
</P>
<P>
   They looked at the new fall lineup _ which features no Latinos
in a leading role _ and said, ``!Basta!'' Enough.
</P>
<P>
   One out of every 10 Americans is Latino, but who would know that
watching prime-time TV, where fewer than 2 percent of the
characters are Latino?
</P>
<P>
   The boycott, which ended Sept. 26, was a bad idea whose time had
come. Bad because there's no way to gauge Latino viewership. But it
forced execs to sprinkle some token Latino characters into a few
shows. So now we'll have a Latina on ``Sabrina the Teenage Witch.''
It's progress.
</P>
<P>
   But if these same Latino leaders really want to stop the TV
brown-out, they need to turn to their own community and confront an
even bigger problem: the whitewash that is Spanish-language TV.
</P>
<P>
   Turn on any of the dozen novellas (soap operas) on Telemundo and
Univision, the two dominant cable stations that air programs from
Latin America, and you'll see more blondes and redheads than on
``Baywatch.''
</P>
<P>
   Peroxide-blond actresses outnumber dark-haired ones. As for male
actors, they don't have to dye their hair, but their facial
features tend to the Anglo side.
</P>
<P>
   The casting directors seem to be following the old street
saying: ``If you're white, you're right. If you're black, step
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Spanish-language TV's most celebrated stars are not simply
white, though. They're super-white. Talk show host Cristina
Saralegui _ who has more viewers than Oprah _ dyes her hair
platinum to soften her almost ghostly complexion. TV astrologer
Walter Mercado, with his blazing red hair (also dyed), has features
so Nordic you'd never guess he was Latino.
</P>
<P>
   The problem isn't with the Cristinas and Walters of the Latin
American world, it's the lack of faces any shades darker. The
majority of the TV news anchors and novella stars have European
features, a misrepresentation of the majority of Latinos. Most of
us are mestizo; we come in some form of beige or brown. A good
number of us have African or indigenous features.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Spanish-language TV, I sometimes feel I have stepped
into an episode of ``Twilight Zone,'' where everything is reversed;
the majority becomes the minority.
</P>
<P>
   If the characters weren't speaking Spanish, anyone stumbling
across one of these shows would swear it was a broadcast from
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a new issue. Latinos _ light and dark alike _ have
long complained to each other about it, but we put up with it
because we have few choices.
</P>
<P>
   I've often wondered if those stations are catering to
lighter-skinned Latinos, who tend to be more affluent, or if the
problem stems from the much talked-about ``colonialized
mentality,'' in which we subconsciously want to look more like
those who oppressed us.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Navarrete, a spokeswoman for The National Council of La
Raza, one of the organizers of the boycott, said the organization
has long been aware of the whitewash on Spanish-language TV, but
chose to focus on the networks because that's what most Americans
watch.
</P>
<P>
   She said it's important for non-Latinos to see us playing
positive roles, because polls show a majority of Americans see
Latinos as ``lazy, unpatriotic, undereducated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have direct contact with a group, your ideas
about that group are going to be shaped by the media,'' Navarrete
said.
</P>
<P>
   She also spoke about surveys that show that Latino children
ascribe positive attributes to white TV characters and negative
ones to their own ethnic group. ``Latino kids are not seeing
themselves on TV,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That's true, but isn't it even more harmful for Latinos to see
themselves depicted only as a light shade of beige?
</P>
<P>
   Univision is the fifth-most-watched network, according to
Nielsen Media Research, with 92 percent share of US
Spanish-speaking viewers. And it's growing by leaps and bounds.
</P>
<P>
   Many young Latinos watch these shows. What about the
dark-skinned Latina who watches these programs? Or the Peruvian
with strong Indian features? The message to them: whiter is better.
</P>
<P>
   So as we end this boycott, maybe we should look to put pressure
on the Spanish-language media. Tell them we won't watch their shows
until they, like their American counterparts, find some color.

IN THE POST-GARRITY ERA, DARE WE FORGET THE PAST? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The recent passing of US Court Judge W. Arthur Garrity Jr.
marked the end of a symbolic era in Boston, a time of chaos and
controversy over school desegregation.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the next round of city elections, we face a choice:
either move the city's educational system forward _ return it to
the days of school segregation that prompted Judge Garrity to order
a massive busing program.
</P>
<P>
   With some merit, critics say Garrity's decision to desegregate
the city's schools was disruptive, if not destructive, to the way
things were. No doubt, busing brought hardship and frustration to
many parents, as well as to the students previously enrolled in
schools close to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there always has been busing in Boston, but the buses
went largely where the parents wanted them to go _ some to
segregated schools far from their own neighborhoods _ and no one
complained.
</P>
<P>
   But Garrity's order caused a racial explosion that exposed to
the nation a major northern city's racism. A spotlight was cast on
our deliberately segregated public schools, and how they rendered
an inferior education to thousands of black students.
</P>
<P>
   But Garrity's critics fail to acknowledge the reason Garrity,
with the full weight of the federal judiciary, made his decision.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the School Committee engaged in deliberate
segregation of the city's schools, and thus violated federal law
based on Brown vs. The Board of Education. As with the South, this
de jure segregation of the city's school system came at a time when
African-Americans had little or no power to overturn it, except in
the courts.
</P>
<P>
   So while Garrity's order may have been disruptive for some, it
was less so than the segregated system had long been for black
families, forced to endure an inferior education.
</P>
<P>
   What the School Committee of pre-busing days did was, quite
simply, to break the law. Judge Garrity ordered that the law be
upheld _ courageously standing against fierce resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, at least two things have happened. The tumult caused
by Garrity's order died down, replaced by a quieter resistance; and
a new plan that required much less busing to maintain school
desegregation was created and adopted.
</P>
<P>
   That plan, called controlled-choice, was the brainchild of
Charles Willie, a sociology professor emeritus at Harvard
University, and Michael Alves, a senior planner at Brown
University. As the plan progressed over the years, the number of
children attending schools in their own neighborhood sharply
increased. Many of the physically and educationally inferior
schools were vastly improved. The plan was working.
</P>
<P>
   But to many critics, the plan did not erase, for once and for
all, the fact that Boston is still under a federal court order to
maintain school desegregation, even when `white flight' left the
city's schools more black than white. Despite the imbalance of the
white-black student ratio, the plan still provides equal
educational opportunities to all students, regardless of color,
which the segregated system never did.
</P>
<P>
   The present School Committee has voted to end the controlled
choice plan, replacing it with the open policy of allowing students
to attend any school they wish, as in the days prior to
court-ordered desegreation. Supporters argue that this return to
neighborhood schools is better for the children and better for the
overall educational system.
</P>
<P>
   The school committee will oversee the transition next year from
controlled choice to neighborhood schools. Whoever is appointed
will serve on that panel. There may be some seeking the appointment
who favor a more racially balanced school system with improved
school facilities, and there may be others who prefer to have
students go to neighborhood schools regardless of whether they are
all white, all black, or all Hispanic or all Asian.
</P>
<P>
   The danger, of course, is that the end of controlled choice,
combined with a school committee majority opposed to racial balance
could bring segregation back to the city's school system. That
would be a legal violation and a moral one, given that it would
again result in an unequal educational system, one that meant
inferior resources for one group of school children.
</P>
<P>
   The new School Committee _ as well as the school superintendent,
the Boston City Council, and the mayor _ can help usher in an era
that guarantees equal education for all. Or it can repeat its own
past and prompt another federal judge to make another ruling such
as Garrity's epochal court order.
</P>
<P>
   This time, more of this responsibility for equal education will
fall on the mayor, who oversees an appointed school committee as
opposed to the elected committee that created a segregated system.
</P>
<P>
   Boston, as other cities have done, can remove the stigma of
court-ordered desegregation by taking positive steps to ensure a
truly integrated school system, once and for all. Ending
controlled-choice without taking these steps was not the best way
to begin a new era.
</P>
<P>
   Those who want an equal opportunity for all students will be
waiting to see what unfolds in the next two years. And the federal
courts, of course, will be watching, too _ ready to move if
necessary, as did Judge Garrity.

INSTEAD OF A RAISE, GET TIME OFF 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When the International Labor Organization
reported recently that Americans now work the longest hours in the
industrialized world, the statistics were a little misleading. The
real situation in the United States is even more extreme.
</P>
<P>
   The study says that the average U.S. worker put in 1,966 hours
in 1997, compared with 1,731 for the British, 1,656 for the French
and 1,574 for the Germans. Even the Japanese, who used to have a
reputation as the world's workaholics, worked only 1,889 hours in
1995, the most recent year measured there.
</P>
<P>
   The statistic is misleading because it includes all adults who
work part time or full time, but not those who are unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   Now consider three mythical couples: Couple A, where one spouse
works 50 hours a week and the other stays home; Couple B, where
each spouse works 45 hours; and Couple C, where one spouse works 60
and the other 30.
</P>
<P>
   So which couple works the hardest? According to the ILO, it
would be Couple A, where the average worker puts in 50 hours a
week. Remember: The stay-at-home spouse isn't included in the
figures.
</P>
<P>
   What's wrong with this picture? America has more Couple B's and
Couple C's than the other industrialized nations. About 60 percent
of working-age American women are employed. In Japan and the United
Kingdom, it's closer to 50 percent; in France and Germany, it's
closer to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Because women typically work fewer hours than men, they drag
down the averages. And because the United States has so many
working women, they might well be dragging the average down here
more than in other countries. It's impossible to know for sure
because many countries don't separate the sexes when they determine
how many hours are worked.
</P>
<P>
   What you can tell, however, is that comparing Americans' work
figures of today with those of earlier generations is ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   There were a lot more Couple A's back then, when the husband
might have worked long hours, but then did relatively little when
it came to housework or raising the children.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Employment Policy Foundation, only 28 percent
of married moms were employed in 1960. Now it's more than 70
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Don't take this to mean that women shouldn't be working or ought
to put in more hours or anything of the sort. Having more women in
the work force has made many lives more fulfilling, strengthened
the American economy and enabled more husbands to bail out of
unsatisfactory jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But do take it to mean that Americans are obsessed with work,
and it's going to catch up with us. While Americans kept piling on
the hours from 1980 to 1997, the ILO report says that productivity
grew faster in many other countries, including Japan, France and
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``People do burn out,'' Lawrence Jeff Johnson, co-author of the
ILO study, told the Associated Press. ``If they keep working this
hard for these long hours, there is burnout and there are
diminishing returns.''
</P>
<P>
   Those diminishing returns aren't limited to the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Parents aren't as involved with raising their kids as they used
to be, and God knows that tons of married and single people spend
their weeknights watching television because they're too worn out
to do anything else.
</P>
<P>
   To put things into perspective, consider this: If you're a
typical American worker and you took your normal vacation and
normal holidays, then took the entire months of November and
December off each year, you would still work more hours than the
typical German.
</P>
<P>
   It's understandable that people obsess over the size of their
paychecks, but next time you're tempted to ask for a raise, ask for
more time off instead. It's easier on your employer because it
usually doesn't cost extra money, and you won't lose 45 or 50
percent of it to taxes, the way you would with a raise.
</P>
<P>
   For working parents, if you each had five weeks off, it would
give you time for a real family vacation, not just rushing to a
place for a few days and then rushing back. You could have time to
bond with your children to help make up for all those other harried
weeks, and maybe even have a few days just for yourselves.
</P>
<P>
   If five weeks off sounds ridiculously high, wake up and smell
the French roast. In France and Italy and many other European
countries, it's common for workers to have an entire month off.
</P>
<P>
   How do you get the time off? The same way you get anything else
from your employer: Be one of your company's best workers.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever you do get a vacation, make sure it's a real one, not
something when you're called and paged and bothered. If your boss
says you're too indispensable to be left alone, make sure your
paycheck reflects that. If it doesn't, get outta town.

NO SIMPLE ANSWERS ON MENINGITIS VACCINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN HSU  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In January, Boston University senior Julia Kenna went to BU
Health Services because she thought she had a migraine.
</P>
<P>
   A campus doctor told her to pick up some aspirin and go home and
rest. Two hours later, Kenna was incapacitated from bouts of
vomiting and a raging headache. She managed to dial 911 for an
ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt so stupid calling 911. But I knew something was really
wrong,'' said Kenna, who graduated from BU in May and is now
working as a temp in Brooklyn, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   After being taken to St. Elizabeth's Medical Center in Boston,
she quickly became disoriented. Doctors suspected bacterial
meningitis because Kenna had the infection's hallmarks: headache,
vomiting, disorientation, high fever and a stiff neck. They
confirmed their suspicions by taking a sample of spinal fluid.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's scary about this bacteria is that it can kill people
more rapidly than any other infection that we know,'' said Dr.
Michael Worthington, chief of infectious disease at St.
Elizabeth's, who treated Kenna with intravenous antibiotics.
``People can be well, then in shock and dead six hours later.'' If
Kenna had waited until that evening, Worthington said, she may have
died.
</P>
<P>
   Meningococcal meningitis, an inflammation of the lining of the
spinal cord and brain, is caused by the Neisseria meningitidis
bacterium, which normally lives harmlessly in people's mouths and
throats but can enter the spinal fluid, though doctors are baffled
as to how it happens. The bacteria is generally transmitted through
saliva; by kissing or sharing toothbrushes, lipsticks, drinking
glasses and eating utensils.
</P>
<P>
   While meningococcal disease is still considered very rare, its
incidence among 15- to 24-year-olds has doubled over the last five
years to more than 600 cases annually, prompting some colleges to
recommend a vaccine to their students. Each year, about 125
students on college campuses get the disease, and about five to 15
students die from it.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, the University of Connecticut confirmed its first
case of meningococcal disease in six years. The student was
hospitalized, and 30 others in her dorm were given antibiotics as a
preventive measure.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, however, college students are not at higher risk than
others for developing meningococcal disease, but freshmen living in
dormitories may have a three- to six-times greater risk of getting
the infection than all college students, according to preliminary
studies by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Many public health experts believe bacterial meningitis is too
rare for widespread vaccination, except for soldiers in cramped
barracks or for those who travel to high-risk areas such as
sub-Sahara Africa, where the last major outbreak of meningococcal
disease, in 1996, killed more than 25,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Although the CDC currently does not recommend that all college
students get the vaccination, some schools are offering it, at $60
to $75 per shot.
</P>
<P>
   Parents have been hungry for information about the vaccine since
highly publicized deaths on college campuses within the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, Dartmouth College had two confirmed cases of
meningococcal disease; one woman died and another student
recovered. Dartmouth later offered free vaccines to summer
students. Recently, letters recommending the vaccine, now $60, went
out to parents.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Brown University Health Services and other Rhode
Island colleges also offered free vaccines paid for by the Rhode
Island Department of Health to students; this was after three Rhode
Island children died from the disease within a few weeks of each
other. This year, Brown will still offer the vaccine, but it will
only be free for Rhode Island residents.
</P>
<P>
   The meningococcal diseases _ which include meningitis and an
even deadlier less-common infection of the blood known as
meningococcemia _ strike about 2,800 Americans each year, most of
them children less than five years old. And unlike viral
meningitis, which is not life threatening and accounts for 90
percent of cases of the disease seen in the US, bacterial
meningitis is fatal about 10 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine Menomune, manufactured by Pasteur Merieux Connaught,
covers four strains of meningococcal disease, but not strain B,
which makes up a third of US cases. The vaccine has been available
since 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Some health officials say that all students should consider
being immunized, especially freshman. After Georgia college athlete
Evan Bozof died of meningitis last year, his mother persuaded the
University of Georgia Board of Regents to require schools to
suggest the vaccine to new students.
</P>
<P>
   And last December, the family of Alanna Haywood, a Williams
College student, won a $1 million lawsuit after she died of
meningococcal disease; the family accused health care workers of
being negligent. Haywood spent a night at the school infirmary
before being sent to North Adams Regional Hospital, where she died
two hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Many, however, say that because the disease is so rare,
widespread immunization doesn't make sense. Those who oppose
routine shots point out that the vaccine is expensive, does not
protect against the B strain, only works for three to five years,
and may be only 85 percent effective in the strains it does protect
against.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vaccine is not a foolproof way to provide protection
against meningitis,'' said Dr. David Rosenthal, director of Harvard
University Health Services and a professor of medicine at Harvard
Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a vaccine would not have helped Kenna, who acquired the
B strain of the bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman in college may be more susceptible to the disease
because of their new found freedoms, many of which, to the chagrin
of parents, involve close contact with others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not surprising because it's the time when people do more
social drinking, are experiencing sexual relationships, sharing
cups, cigarettes, lipsticks,'' said Dr. Bela Matyas, director of
the Massachusetts Department of Health's epidemiology program.
</P>
<P>
   But parents should be more concerned about regular rowdy college
behavior than meningitis, said Dr. Thomas Nary, director of health
services at Boston College. ``The risk of meningitis to any student
is very, very low,'' Nary said. ``Unfortunately I don't have a
vaccine for drunken driving and risky behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston College does not recommend the vaccine, but if parents
ask for it, they will make it available. Some parents say that at
least being presented with a vaccine option is critical. In Evan
Bozof's case, it could have saved his life, says his mother Lynn,
because he died from the C strain, which the vaccine can prevent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a CDC advisory committee will convene next month to
consider whether recent studies warrant a change in the agency's
vaccine recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Matyas of the state health department encourages parents and
students to get information about the disease, but says that
whether or not to be vaccinated should be made on a case by case
basis.

A MAN WHO DUMPS HIS FIANCEE IS A CAD, BUT IF A WOMAN ...
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Interesting, the perceptions of what it means for a man and a
woman to do the exact same thing.
</P>
<P>
   A man who strays outside a marriage, for example, is a pig being
led around by his ... um ... testosterone, but a woman who sleeps
with someone other than her husband is usually in need of therapy
and compassion _ or just having a good time because (nudge, wink)
her husband doesn't give her what she needs.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, a man who leaves a woman at the altar has reached a
whole new level of pond scumminess, but a woman who leaves a man is
_ let's see here now _ the heroine of a movie that has earned more
than $144 million.
</P>
<P>
   I refer to ``Runaway Bride,'' the almost insufferable film
starring Julia Roberts and Richard Gere. Roberts plays a small-town
girl who has left three young men at the altar, and Gere is the
tough, at least slightly sexist New York columnist who writes about
her escapades.
</P>
<P>
   Only he gets a lot of stuff wrong (he says she's gotten cold
feet seven times, not three), gets canned (by his ex-wife, of
course) and goes to her little Mayberry-like Maryland town to do an
expose on her. The two meet and _ well, you get two guesses as to
what happens, and the first one doesn't count.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is horrible, but it's so popular that People magazine
recently ran a cover story on six women who stiffed their
hubbies-to-be at The Big Moment.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, the women are portrayed as strong, smart and
resilient, and calling off the wedding is portrayed as acceptable,
if not downright noble.
</P>
<P>
   Each woman has a different reason, of course, but they all end
up happy, whether married or single.
</P>
<P>
   All together now: Awwwwww.
</P>
<P>
   Compare and contrast this, if you will, to the public reaction
in November 1997 to London lawyer Tasos Michael's jilting of Nicole
Contos at the altar. People cheered and toasted her as she danced
to the disco anthem ``I Will Survive'' at the
reception-that-wasn't, while he flew off to enjoy their
honeymoon-that-wasn't in Tahiti.
</P>
<P>
   He became Mr. Cad _ the nerve of him, flying off to their
honeymoon destination! She bravely fought back tears while hitting
the talk shows, and sold her story to the tabloids.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the outraged response of women _ many of whom could
be seen shaking their heads at the horror of it all when Contos
appeared on talk shows _ Michael had committed something close to a
major felony. He was despicable, a man who cared nothing for anyone
but himself _ and what an awful, awful thing to happen to that poor
girl.
</P>
<P>
   Pity for her, hatred for him.
</P>
<P>
   Easy. Simple.
</P>
<P>
   Only it's not that easy or simple. The truth is, a man who calls
off a wedding is often making an agonizing, heartbreaking decision;
and believe it or not, ladies, he just might _ might _ be thinking
of her, too.
</P>
<P>
   I speak from experience: Back in 1987 I called off marriage with
my girlfriend of nearly two years. It wasn't at the altar _ it was
three months before the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   I simply realized that I did not want to be with this woman for
the rest of my life and that (because of our different views on
children and other issues) she would ultimately not want to be with
me. To have married her would have meant an ugly ending, with at
least one child caught in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   And that would have been worse than what I did.
</P>
<P>
   The point is, I didn't want to hurt anyone. It wasn't a flippant
decision, it wasn't made in haste, and there was nobody else.
</P>
<P>
   I was simply trying to look down the road and honestly see what
would be best for both of us. That doesn't make me a great guy, but
it doesn't make me a cad, either.
</P>
<P>
   But in return I suddenly had everyone in the world angry at me.
Or so it seemed. Her father, I think, would have hurt me if he'd
gotten the chance. I was in a very lonely place, and I spent a lot
of time riding around in my car, crying, wondering why I ``just
couldn't do it,'' but knowing deeper in my heart that it was the
best thing.
</P>
<P>
   My ex-fiancee remarried soon. She lives in the Midwest and has a
stable marriage, three lovely daughters and an infant son. I truly
believe she is happier than she would have been with me, and I am
sure she has more kids than she would have had we married. (By the
way, I know this because she talks to my mom every couple of
months. But that's a whole 'nother column for a whole 'nother day.)
</P>
<P>
   No, I don't know the in's and out's of the Michael/Contos
relationship. He may be a jerk, and she may an absolute angel.
</P>
<P>
   But more likely, he just realized that leaving now would be
better than leaving later. For everyone. That's not to excuse the
fact that he did it at the very last moment, but, hey, I think his
heart might have been in the right place _ he may have truly been
trying to protect both of them from wasting years in a downward
spiral of unpleasantness and bitter feelings. And give both of them
a chance to find someone with whom they really could happily grow
old.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe he hurt like hell doing it.
</P>
<P>
   All I'm saying is, it's possible.
</P>
<P>
   Even if he's a man.

<P>
   BOSTON _ She has already begun packing for a trip she hopes she
will never take.
</P>
<P>
   Pajamas, a pair of jeans, and underwear all sit in a small pile
on Cheryl Amirault LeFave's dining room floor, waiting for the day
when she is returned, handcuffed, to the prison life she lived for
eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly she waits _ for guidance from her lawyers, for decisions
by the courts, for advice from friends and supporters. She meets
with a psychiatrist and a teacher of ``bioenergetic healing.''
</P>
<P>
   In her lengthiest interview since the state's highest court
reinstated her child-abuse conviction last month, LeFave spoke of
the seemingly inevitable, her imminent return to MCI-Framingham,
and the range of emotions she has felt since the Supreme Judicial
Court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   She shudders at the thought of another strip-search, another mug
shot, another round of fingerprinting.
</P>
<P>
   LeFave's lawyers have told her they expect the SJC to announce
soon that it has rejected her motion for a new hearing. Some time
on the same day, she expects a call from the Middlesex district
attorney's office notifying her of a date for the reinstatement of
her conviction and sentence.
</P>
<P>
   She hopes her return to prison will last no longer than three
months, the time it would take for the state Parole Board to hear
her case. She hopes it will free her, since she has been free for
nearly four years, living productively and working.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if her freedom depends on her admitting guilt, that she will
not do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who in their right mind would fight for 14 years if they were
guilty?'' asked LeFave, 42. ``It's not true, and I have fought for
14 years to be able to say to those children one day, `I never
abused you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But the parents of the preschool-age children that LeFave, her
mother, and brother were convicted of molesting in their Malden
day-care center have their own, ongoing anguish, as do the
children, now grown. And just as adamantly, they proclaim LeFave's
guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Parents describe how their once well-adjusted children suddenly
had trouble sleeping, began wetting their beds, and were discovered
mimicking sexual acts on friends and siblings.
</P>
<P>
   As one parent said after the SJC ruling, ``These children were
sexually abused, and there are no ifs, ands, or buts about that in
my mind or the minds of any of the people who were involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the children in the case, now young adults, sought
therapy after the ordeal. Some ran away from home, some attempted
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Globe in 1995, one young woman said
adamantly, ``I know Cheryl molested me and I can remember it as
clear as if it was Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   LeFave's cause has been championed nationally, most notably by
the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal. Dorothy Rabinowitz,
a Journal editorial writer, even had a hand in publicizing a fund
estalished to pay the legal bills of &QL; 
people, like LeFave, who claim they were wrongly convicted of child
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Protected under the glass top of her dining room table is a
handwritten note of support from Harvey Silverglate, the
high-profile defense attorney; ``May 1999 be the year of your
family's victory,'' it reads. Hanging nearby are oversized pictures
of LeFave and her family taken by Silverglate's wife, Elsa Dorfman,
a prominent Cambridge photographer.
</P>
<P>
   It is with a tangled combination of rage, sorrow, and
hopelessness that LeFave prepares to become an inmate once again _
this time without her mother, Violet, her long-time cellmate, who
died of cancer two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they nurtured a prize-winning pumpkin when they were
in a medium-security facility in rural Lancaster. Together, they
shared a cement-block cell where Violet had such violent nightmares
that she smashed and broke her toes on the walls, her daughter
recalls.
</P>
<P>
   LeFave was 29 when she entered prison along with her mother in
1987.
</P>
<P>
   Three years earlier, she had married and bought a house in
Melrose. She and her husband, Al, separated after her release in
1995, after a Superior Court judge overturned her and her mother's
convictions.
</P>
<P>
   LeFave's brother, Gerald, who also worked at the Fells Acres Day
School and was convicted of child abuse as well, received a 30- to
40-year sentence in 1986 and remains jailed at the Plymouth County
House of Correction.
</P>
<P>
   LeFave has not seen him since the SJC's August ruling because
convicted felons are not allowed to visit prisoners. Instead, they
speak by telephone at least twice a day.
</P>
<P>
   Her house, with its distinctly female touch, is homey,
comfortable and cluttered with knickknacks and family photographs.
One framed picture shows LeFave and her mother at a ``reunion'' of
other nationally known convicted child molesters, including Kelly
Michaels and Bucky McMartin, whose sentences were later overturned.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the apartment, a butterfly motif _ LeFave says she
associates the creatures with freedom _ is strong.
</P>
<P>
   LeFave is more stylish now than when her face first landed on
the nightly news. Gone is the waist-length feathered brown hair;
she now sports a fashionable shoulder-length cut, subtly frosted
blond.
</P>
<P>
   Since last month's ruling, LeFave has been on an unpaid leave of
absence from her job in Charlestown, where she worked in customer
service for John Hancock. Anticipating her return to prison, LeFave
has spent the last several weeks at home sorting out her personal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   She says she hs been promised that her job will be waiting for
her when she is released.
</P>
<P>
   LeFave said last month's ruling ``paralyzed'' her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had such high hopes,'' she said quietly. ``I came to believe
that if you go through the system, it will work for you. I thought,
`How could be this be? How could I, who lived a simple little life,
become a victim of a system that didn't work for me?' ''
</P>
<P>
   LeFave expects a warm welcome by many of the inmates she knew
when she left, particularly the ``lifers and long-timers'' she
gravitated toward, the prisoners who viewed her mother as a den
mother of sorts. But she knows there will be new prisoners who will
dislike her instantly because of the crimes attached to her name.
</P>
<P>
   Facing prison again, she feels emotionally dead, wanting to keep
fighting but rapidly losing the will to do so. She spends most of
her time at home, running errands, writing letters and sharing
e-mail with supporters across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want a life,'' she said. ``I can't have fun. I can't place
myself in a group of people who are laughing. I can only think,
`How could this happen to my life?' ''

WHY DOES THE ROOM SPIN WHEN WE'RE DIZZY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. When we spin around and around, and then stop, why does the
room keep spinning?
</P>
<P>
   D.B. Newton, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Even after your body has stopped, some of you keeps going.
Inside your ear are three semi-circular canals, little tubes filled
with liquid and lined with tiny hairs.
</P>
<P>
   When you spin around, the liquid moves, bending the hairs. Those
hairs are attached to nerve endings which send the brain
information about how much the hairs are bending and in what
direction. The message, essentially, is ``We're spinning.''
</P>
<P>
   But when you stop, the liquid in the canals keeps sloshing for a
few moments, and the hairs don't straighten back out immediately.
So the ears keep sending the brain the message even after you've
stopped. Since you know you're not spinning anymore, it looks like
the room is.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes dizziness is accompanied by an uncomfortable feeling
in your stomach. That's because the three inputs of the balance
system don't agree. Your ears say ``We're spinning.'' But your eyes
and the somatosensory system, your awareness of your body in space,
are both telling the brain ``No we're not.''
</P>
<P>
   The conflicting balance information causes the message ``We're
nauseous.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What causes itching?
</P>
<P>
   M.H., Ames Iowa &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. This one has the top experts scratching their heads.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is Dr. Jeffrey Bernhard of U. Mass. Memorial Health
Care editor of the journal of the American Academy of Dermatology,
and author of the book ``Itch.''
</P>
<P>
   He says itch starts in polymodal nociceptors, tiny nerve endings
just fractions of a millimeter below the surface of the skin which
are also where pain begins. He says there are three initiators of
itch: mechanical, like a scratchy woolen blanket; allergic, like a
mosquito bite or poison ivy or hives; and inflammatory, like skin
diseases such as psoriasis or eczema.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a demonstration of the mechanical stimulation of itch.
Scratch your cheek as lightly as you can. It tickles a bit. If it
was a bug crawling on you, you might identify it as an itch. That's
the polymodal nociceptors responding to a mechanical stimulus.
Scratch harder and it feels more like pain. Bernhard says one
theory is that ``itch'' nociceptors activate before pain ones do
because they're closer to the surface. Pain nociceptors may be
deeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``In evolutionary terms, you want a sensitive alarm system that
can quickly tell you if something's landed on you that you don't
want to be there,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   Allergic and inflammatory itches are chemical reactions to one
or more of 50 chemicals in the body that have been associated with
itch. These include histamines, released in reaction to allergens,
which dilate blood vessels and let those vessels leak. That causes
swelling, which is often associated with itch. Bernhard says
another class of chemical itch inducers are opioids, which include
endorphins. Some people with certain types of liver disease suffer
terrible itching, which is eased by drugs that block these opioids.
Morphine heroin and cocaine, opioids, also cause itching.
</P>
<P>
   So how does scratch work?
</P>
<P>
   The experts theorize that scratching triggers touch receptors in
the skin that send a stronger signal than nociceptors.
</P>
<P>
   That stronger signal blocks the weaker itch message from making
into the spine and up to the brain.
</P>
<P>
   And how do anti-itch medications work?
</P>
<P>
   Lotions provide a cooling effect and their paste blocks
mechanical stimuli. Anti-histamines dry up some of the offending
histamines ``and they make you drowsy'' Bernhard adds. Topical
anesthetics numb the nociceptors.
</P>
<P>
   Bernhard says as common, and infuriating, as itch is, whoever
figures out just how it works, and how to relieve it, is going to
make a lot of scratch.

AFTER THE MOUNT CARMEL DUST SETTLES, WILL THINGS BE CLEARER?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes the power I wield over the federal bureaucrats and
politicians in Washington is absolutely scary.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner did I write a column insisting that there is no need
for one more investigation of 1993's Branch Davidian fiasco than
the powers-that-be reacted: There will not be one more
investigation of the Davidian affair.
</P>
<P>
   There will be three more investigations of the Davidian affair.
At least three more.
</P>
<P>
   Who's to say that we won't end up with four more? Or five, or
six, or 60? Once these people latch onto something that guarantees
live TV coverage and front-page headlines, they just aren't
inclined to let it go.
</P>
<P>
   So let's see: So far there's John Danforth, the special counsel
appointed by the attorney general; and there's the special Senate
task force headed by Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania; and there's the
House committee chaired by Dan Burton of Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth's probe will supposedly be limited to the events of
April 19, 1993 _ the day that David Koresh and his Davidian cult
went up in flames after a 51-day standoff with federal law
enforcement officials. Specter's investigation will focus on the
standoff and on Chinese spying and illegal campaign contributions _
a natural tie-in if ever there was one. Burton will apparently look
into anything he wants to look into.
</P>
<P>
   ``My committee has jurisdiction over the whole government,''
Burton said in a recent TV interview.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news: Humility is not Burton's strong suit.
</P>
<P>
   The good news: We'll know who to blame the next time there's a
government shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   With all these probes going on, it should come as no surprise
that the probers are already tripping over each other. According to
news reports, Danforth is complaining that Senate investigators
started interviewing witnesses without checking with him. Burton,
of course, fired off a batch of subpoenas to the White House before
Danforth even had a chance to set up shop.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a question: Will the competing investigations provide the
public with a better understanding of what happened when the
government faced off against Koresh near Waco, or will the multiple
rehash cause more mystery and confusion?
</P>
<P>
   Here's another question: What happens if all the investigations
yield different conclusions?
</P>
<P>
   What if Danforth says Koresh set the fire that killed him and
his disciples, and Burton says the FBI set it, and Specter says the
fire was the result of spontaneous combustion? Which investigator
are we supposed to believe?
</P>
<P>
   Danforth is a man of impeccable integrity, and if he says the
government burned up the Davidians, I guess I'll have to believe
him.
</P>
<P>
   But here's a prediction: Danforth's investigation will produce
the same conclusion that every previous investigation has produced:
The Davidians set the fire as part of a murder-suicide apocalypse
that Koresh had envisioned long before the federal Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms came knocking on his door.
</P>
<P>
   Burton, on the other hand, loathes President Clinton and
Attorney General Janet Reno so consumingly that he will be trying
to find some way to blame them for the tragic outcome of the
standoff. His conclusions will be useless, needless to say, because
he lacks so much as one ounce of objectivity.
</P>
<P>
   And Specter? As a former resident of Pennsylvania, I can say
with unqualified certainty that the only predictable thing about
Specter is that he is relentlessly unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, it doesn't really matter what Burton and Specter
come up with because their so-called investigations aren't
investigations at all. The House and Senate are interested in
nothing more than political grandstanding, in hitching a ride on
the latest wave of controversy over the Mount Carmel debacle. Their
findings may have no more validity than the wild-eyed letters and
e-mails I've been getting from anti-government/pro-Koresh
conspiracy theorists who obviously can't distinguish fact from
fiction.
</P>
<P>
   It is truly unfortunate that Congress won't butt out and let
Danforth do his job.

   Not all fashion trends begin on the runway or on the street.
Sometimes they start on the movie screen, where a new look or
hairstyle can inspire millions of imitations. Hollywood's star
hairstylists are well aware of their power _ to keep it, they're
willing to put up with all sorts of problems that ordinary stylists
never have to face.
</P>
<P>
   Consider continuity. ``One Fine Day'' takes place over the
course of about 24 hours, but the filming took three months. Louis
Licari of the bicoastal Louis Licari Haircolor Group had to make
sure that Michelle Pfeiffer's hair was the same color throughout
the production.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's tricky,'' says Licari. ``Most people's haircolor can
vary _ no matter how slightly _ with each visit.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim Basinger's upcoming film, ``I Dreamed of Africa,'' takes
place over the course of about 10 years, but it was shot in just a
few months. Jonathan Antin colorist Lorri Goddard racked up the
frequent flyer miles _ first to Africa, then to Italy _ every time
Basinger needed a different shade of blond.
</P>
<P>
   Period pieces come with their own unique hurdles. Jewel's very
contemporary 'do didn't fit into Ang Lee's upcoming Civil War
drama, ``Ride With the Devil,'' so hairstylist Jonathan Antin
straightened out the layers to make the style more '60s _ 1860s,
that is.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes an actress must be drabbed down for a role. When Susan
Sarandon played the ailing ex-wife in ``Stepmom,'' Licari couldn't
wait for her copper color to tone down naturally.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process is called color removal, but we speed things along
using hot oil treatments,'' he explains. ``They help lift the
pigment faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Constant color changes can sometimes be too much for an actress
to bear. Ashley Judd was in tears when Candace, the colorist at
Beverly Hills' Sublime Salon, showed up on the set of ``Norma Jean
and Marilyn'' for an emergency fix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her hair was supposed to be dark brown, but it was pink,''
recalls Candace. When someone goes from blond to brown, hair needs
to get a ``filler'' first to fill in the porous hair, so the darker
shade will take. Obviously someone had skipped this step with Judd.
</P>
<P>
   Licari has gone through a similar series of extreme color
changes with Cate Blanchett. After going dark brown for ``Oscar and
Lucinda'' and deep red for ``Elizabeth,'' Blanchett went very blond
for a film she was working on at the time of this year's Academy
Awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to get it progressively lighter,'' he says. ``It's
gentler on the hair if you have that luxury of time.''
</P>
<P>
   The all-time champion of color changes may be Helen Hunt. Since
she had to film ``As Good As It Gets'' simultaneously with her
sitcom ``Mad About You,'' she went from Carol Conelly drab to Jamie
Buchman blond ``practically every other day,'' remembers stylist
Darrell Redleaf-Fielder of Nubest &AMP; Co. ``I had to mix two shades
to cut through that golden blond hair. Then she'd wash the brown
out the next day. When I saw that movie for the first time, I
practically bit all my nails off.''
</P>
<P>
   A subtle color treatment may be crucial to making a character
believable, but it's a great new cut that can spark a big trend in
the real world _ and make a star out of its creator as well.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, when Bruce Paltrow went for his usual trim at
L.A.'s Prive Salon, he brought along his daughter, Gwyneth. Owner
Laurent started asking her about the character in her next film,
``Sliding Doors,'' and suggested a drastic cut. The next day,
Paltrow was back with then-boyfriend Brad Pitt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was more nervous than she was,'' laughs Laurent.
``But that haircut really changed my whole career. I was in every
magazine after that haircut.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Actors are very confident when undergoing a new look,'' says
John Freida hairstylist Sally Herschberger, who's responsible for
Meg Ryan's flopsy-mopsy hairstyle. ``They get it. They're excited
about the process.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, says L.A. salon owner Allen Edwards, actors'
motives are similar to those of salon clients everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Real people are constantly reconsidering how they want to look
to those around them,'' he says. ``How different is that from what
actors and stylists do for a role? We're all playing our own
roles.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, ours don't usually come with a rigid production
schedule. Then again, we don't have our own trailers, either.

   ``Her hair was supposed to be dark brown, but it was pink,''
recalls Candace. When someone goes from blond to brown, hair needs
to get a ``filler'' first to fill in the porous hair, so the darker
shade will take. Obviously someone had skipped this step with Judd.
</P>
<P>
   Licari has gone through a similar series of extreme color
changes with Cate Blanchett. After going dark brown for ``Oscar and
Lucinda'' and deep red for ``Elizabeth,'' Blanchett went very blond
for a film she was working on at the time of this year's Academy
Awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to get it progressively lighter,'' he says. ``It's
gentler on the hair if you have that luxury of time.''
</P>
<P>
   The all-time champion of color changes may be Helen Hunt. Since
she had to film ``As Good As It Gets'' simultaneously with her
sitcom ``Mad About You,'' she went from Carol Conelly drab to Jamie
Buchman blond ``practically every other day,'' remembers stylist
Darrell Redleaf-Fielder of Nubest &AMP; Co. ``I had to mix two shades
to cut through that golden blond hair. Then she'd wash the brown
out the next day. When I saw that movie for the first time, I
practically bit all my nails off.''
</P>
<P>
   A subtle color treatment may be crucial to making a character
believable, but it's a great new cut that can spark a big trend in
the real world _ and make a star out of its creator as well.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, when Bruce Paltrow went for his usual trim at
L.A.'s Prive Salon, he brought along his daughter, Gwyneth. Owner
Laurent started asking her about the character in her next film,
``Sliding Doors,'' and suggested a drastic cut. The next day,
Paltrow was back with then-boyfriend Brad Pitt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was more nervous than she was,'' laughs Laurent.
``But that haircut really changed my whole career. I was in every
magazine after that haircut.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Actors are very confident when undergoing a new look,'' says
John Freida hairstylist Sally Herschberger, who's responsible for
Meg Ryan's flopsy-mopsy hairstyle. ``They get it. They're excited
about the process.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, says L.A. salon owner Allen Edwards, actors'
motives are similar to those of salon clients everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Real people are constantly reconsidering how they want to look
to those around them,'' he says. ``How different is that from what
actors and stylists do for a role? We're all playing our own
roles.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, ours don't usually come with a rigid production
schedule. Then again, we don't have our own trailers, either.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ An increasing number of elite athletes seem to be
spending almost as much time designing the clothes they wear as
performing in them.
</P>
<P>
   Competing in a market that traditionally builds brands _ not
high-profile designers _ activewear makers like Reebok are trying
to personalize their images by having the athletes they sponsor
help out with design.
</P>
<P>
   From choosing fabrics to sketching items, the athletes are
taking a hands-on approach to product development instead of merely
assessing new products.
</P>
<P>
   Take Olympic snowboarder Shannon Dunn, who designed Burton's new
``Feel Good'' snowboards and is now working on designs for the
brand's first streetwear collection, or tennis star Venus Williams,
who talks about design in Reebok's current radio campaign. Or
Olympic figure skater Tara Lipinski, who chose the lilac color and
tinted rhinestone butterfly motifs for her new signature skating
dress for Capezio.
</P>
<P>
   These women represent a new breed of athlete, someone who wants
to win, look good and help build business. They know a canned photo
of them smiling is not enough to sell T-shirts to media-savvy
teen-agers. The athletes, after all, are themselves part of the
very audience activewear makers want to reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having athletes help with design gives brands more
credibility, and it shows they're not just using their athletes'
photos and signatures. It goes beyond name association; it's their
expertise as well,'' said Liz Livingstone, head designer for
Capezio.
</P>
<P>
   Known for competing in fashion-forward looks such as the gold
racerback tank dress she wore at this year's French Open, Anna
Kournikova, an Adidas-sponsored athlete, is ``definitely more
interested in the design process'' than she has been in the past,
said Simon Cartwright, international product manager for tennis at
Adidas.
</P>
<P>
   It is no longer difficult to get her to schedule time for Adidas
designers. She's now calling them, because ``she wants to have more
of a say in what she's wearing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is an athlete's ability. But we live
in such a multimedia age where everything is visual and the average
attention span is about 30 seconds, you have to have an image to go
along with that ability. It's a necessary part of the industry,''
said Nate Brown, tennis product line manager for Adidas. ``They're
using athletics as a launching board to market themselves and their
names.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Michael Jordan is taking a closer look at the women's
activewear business. He is considering launching women's activewear
through his label at Nike next year instead of in 2001, a Nike
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   More hands-on than most athlete-designers, Jordan critiques a
full range of products with his name on them, selects colors and
fabrics, discusses fashion in general with Nike designers and hosts
fashion shows for his brand. At Jordan's request, designers for his
brand have been flown to Chicago to check out his newest car and
his closet for inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Capezio's skating dress for Lipinski has a certificate with the
Olympic gold medal winner's autograph and photograph. To build
brand awareness, Capezio is offering only 150 units of the item,
which retails for $300, this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Lipinski selected the design from 12 that were presented to her,
and she also chose the double-strap-camisole silhouette,
Livingstone said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tara's an Olympic medalist. But there's value in that beyond
what she has accomplished as a skater. Her (design) knowledge is
steep,'' she said. ``Skaters have always been very resourceful
about what they wear. We can glean some knowledge about how some of
her other dresses were made and what materials were used to try to
perfect what we're doing. It helps us make more of a custom-made
dress.''
</P>
<P>
   During the ongoing ``Skate With the Stars'' 10-city tour,
Lipinski has been sharing her design insight with young skaters.
Capezio will introduce another signature dress for Lipinski next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike this year's print ad campaign for Capezio, which includes
several models in addition to Lipinski, next year's campaign will
focus solely on the figure skater, Livingstone said.
</P>
<P>
   Another Olympic figure skater, Kristi Yamaguchi, routinely
offers fashion tips to Celanese executives, a company spokeswoman
said. Last year Yamaguchi arranged to have some of the pro skaters
on the ``Stars on Ice'' tour perform in acetate-blend outfits, the
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Venus William helped Reebok designers develop seven outfits for
this month's tennis U.S. Open _ one for each round. Williams plans
to take her first fashion design course this fall and aims to work
in design professionally, Hayes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great for us that Venus is so involved. It makes our
marketing efforts that much easier. She feels very comfortable
wearing the product and she played a part in creating it,'' Hayes
said. ``It's a two-way street. It's important for an athlete to
care about the growth and success of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams' younger sister, Serena, who seized the United States
Open singles championship on Sept. 11, is also interested in
design. Serena, who has an endorsement deal with Puma, helped Puma
designers update their tenniswear with snugger silhouettes and more
color. She is also interested in bridal design.
</P>
<P>
   Venus and Serena may have a strong future together in the
fashion business. They certainly work well with each other, having
recently won the women's double final. They are the first sisters
to win an Open doubles championship in 101 years.
</P>
<P>
   Nike set up its first athlete advisory council _ 20 athletes
from various sports _ to help with product development of Inner
Actives, performance-oriented innerwear that bowed at retail this
summer. The feedback was ``so valuable'' that the company plans to
organize other advisory councils for other categories, said Carey
Portzline, senior apparel designer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They cared a lot about it because it was something they were
dissatisfied with,'' she said. ``As one athlete said, `This was a
piece of equipment for them.'''
</P>
<P>
   In general, the Nike-sponsored U.S. women's soccer team readily
offers product feedback about product, said Julia Meschter, senior
product designer. They're more approachable and critical about
products than some of the male athletes who sponsor Nike, she
added. &QL;

A PLAN TO PRAY TOGETHER FOR PEACE MERITS SUPPORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM WRIGHT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Fort Worth clergyman has a proposal as bold as it is
beneficent. The Rev. Scott Colglazier, minister of the 5,000-member
University Christian Church in Fort Worth, wants every cleric in
the country, of whatever denomination, to speak and pray for peace
on the first Sunday of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The possibilities stagger the imagination. They are limitless.
An idea so broad, so sweeping in its simplicity, deserves in fact
to be worldwide _ and all-embracing.
</P>
<P>
   Just think. Throughout our aching, weary planet, people yearn
for peace but don't know where to find it. Perhaps _ just possibly
_ if at a given time we all should, even briefly, lay aside our
opinionated certainties, face our inadequacy and pray for mercy and
guidance, something truly quite wonderful might happen to us all.
</P>
<P>
   At the Tower of Babel, we are told, man's celebrated ego left
him babbling but incomprehensible to others. Now comes a clean,
straightforward plea that this human family offer together a prayer
that each could utter and most embrace: God grant that in these
years ahead we learn to seek and practice peace.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the argument that technically the third millennium
will not begin until Jan. 1, 2001. Nor is Colglazier's project
doomed because millions of devout people do not worship on Sunday.
Any day would do. The idea is to get people of good will on the
same wavelength for once. So let it be just as he says. Sunday,
Jan. 2, 2000. If someone wants to start a day early, on a Saturday
Sabbath, welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth, where Colglazier launches his plan, is recognized
most currently across the nation as the scene of that unspeakable
tragedy days ago when the mentally ill Larry Gene Ashbrook stalked
into Wedgwood Baptist Church with a semi-automatic weapon, randomly
killing seven innocent people, including teen-agers, and wounding
others before turning the gun upon himself.
</P>
<P>
   Several things are less known nationally about the city that
spawns this plea for universal New Year's prayer.
</P>
<P>
   One is that on the Sunday after the tragedy, many thousands of
our local citizens, people of almost every religious faith and some
of no formal affiliation, came together in the stands of Texas
Christian University's football stadium to comfort the grieving
families. That day they prayed together, this group of such
heterogeneous ethnic and religious diversity, for healing and hope.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibly surprising fact is an almost unique sense of
religious ecumenicity taking place at Texas Christian University,
the institution to which Colglazier's University Christian Church
is loosely attached.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is TCU the academic home this semester to students from
70 nations representing every continent, but its associated
theological institution, Brite Divinity School, maintains an active
and acclaimed school of Jewish studies.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve days ago, TCU hosted the second annual Gates of Chai
distinguished lectureship. Rabbi Harold Kushner, author of ``When
Bad Things Happen to Good People,'' spoke to a standing-room-only
house at the university's Ed Landreth Auditorium. Community leaders
of all faiths turned out to welcome and hear him. The rabbi
remarked upon the singularity of such warm and responsive
ecumenicity anywhere, particularly in the Bible Belt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tells me,'' said Kushner, that here at least Christians and
Jews have moved ``beyond toleration'' to a higher state of
fellowship and spiritual collaboration. It is altogether
understandable that impetus for an interfaith movement for peace
should spring from this soil.
</P>
<P>
   Is it, then, too utopian to hope that large numbers of
Christians, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists and plain people might unite
nationally on a given day in prayers for peace? Unprecedented,
maybe. But unreasonable to think they might be answered?
</P>
<P>
   The answer could depend upon what meaning we assign to the words
``pray'' and ``peace.'' If prayer be defined as a device to
manipulate God _ to change the cosmic plan, to impress, coax and
cajole the power of the universe to do what we wish _ there might
be very little new except the scale of participation.
</P>
<P>
   But if to pray is to align ourselves with the higher purpose of
One whom we believe already loves his Earth and all his children,
then there's hope in prayer. If its aim be less to change God and
more to change and reconcile ourselves, I believe it has a future
of unbounded potential. This, to the degree I understand, is
consistent with the dogma of all the faiths.
</P>
<P>
   And what is it, exactly, that we mean by peace? Is peace not
more than just the absence of armed conflict, desirable though that
be? Has the word not a positive, active meaning? To be in harmony
with one's universe and one's fellow creatures. To cherish them. To
desire, seek and serve their happiness and best interests. Is this
not the essence of peace?
</P>
<P>
   If we of sundry faiths and nations can come to the dawn of the
next millennium, laying down our own pitiful pretenses at
righteousness, and honestly ask that good things happen for people
who don't seem to like or treat us very well, there may be hope.
For that troublesome neighbor. That unscrupulous business rival.
That rude motorist who squeezed us out of our lane in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   For people who don't have enough to eat, and ones who have too
much. For oppressor and oppressed. For foreigners everywhere so
unlike and yet so like ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   When we can truly pray for these, and mean it, our prayers for
peace may be availing. They may, in fact, be self-fulfilling.
Colglazier's plan deserves support.
</P>

areas erupt with what seems like nearly endless bursts of
destruction. By William J. Broad.

PORTRAIT OF A LAID-BACK ANARCHIST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By REED JOHNSON 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HERMOSA BEACH _ The odyssey begins abruptly, with a thick,
violent slash of black paint that explodes in a blood-red
cloudburst. Next come the words, marching like mutinous conscripts
across the white rectangle of paper: ``Hell! Guns! Army! Kill!''
</P>
<P>
   Bryan J. Flynn, 8 years old, passes this latest sample of his
handiwork to his uncle Raymond Pettibon _ baseball fan, avowed
lifelong anarchist, and arguably one of the half-dozen most
influential U.S. artists of his late-baby boomer generation.
</P>
<P>
   Taking in his nephew's picture at a glance, Pettibon approvingly
notes its aggressive color scheme and freight-train collision of
image and text. The boy is smart, Pettibon knows, always drawing
and thinking. During the summer he comes over most mornings to make
art with the graying 42-year-old man he always refers to as
``Ray.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow, I really like the way you did this, Pee-wee,'' Pettibon
says, using the boy's familial nickname as he studies the picture
of an elongated rifle. ``Wanna make another one?''
</P>
<P>
   Pettibon pulls a sheet of construction paper from a small,
groaning table in his bedroom. Then, blinking back the hard Pacific
light, he settles into a plastic deck chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids that age are fascinated with violence and stuff,''
Pettibon says in his soft, sleepy voice. ``I know I was.''
</P>
<P>
   This, more or less, was how it all began for Raymond Pettibon
himself many years ago, when the drawings first started pouring out
of him as if from an open vein.
</P>
<P>
   Rough, emphatic images of steam engines knifing through
anonymous landscapes, framed by cryptic, philosophical inscriptions
(``When I see a train, I want to take it in my arms.'').
</P>
<P>
   Raw, unnerving pictures of Charles Manson, Ronald Reagan and a
crucified Elvis, a comic rogue's gallery of anti-heroic archetypes
culled from the counter-culture detritus of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Pulp-fiction silhouettes, or '50s cartoon characters like Gumby
and Vavoom (Felix the Cat's tiny, voluble sidekick), incongruously
bracketed by quotations that might've come from a Batman comic
book, the Daily Racing Form or a James Joyce novel _ literary
hierarchies be damned.
</P>
<P>
   All through the '70s and '80s, as Pettibon's reputation grew far
beyond the boundaries of his Southern California home, the drawings
kept coming, perhaps several thousand in all. Surfer dudes hanging
ten on undulating pen-and-ink waves beneath double-entendre
captions (``Catch the Drift''). Baggy-panted baseball players
swinging at pitches just out of reach, while behind them Pettibon's
neat handwriting lobs a rhetorical curveball: ``Who am I? What kind
of man am I?''
</P>
<P>
   Then, the existentially chilling answer, zinging the viewer like
a 90-mph brushback pitch: ``The .250 man.'' In the law of human
averages, it seems, the best most people can hope for is to connect
with success one out of four trips to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Early viewers wondered: Whose voice (or voices) was behind these
haunting images? For it was Pettibon's ghostly authorial presence,
his extraordinary feel for language rather than his choppy drafting
skills, that transmuted the base metal of his images into pictorial
haiku.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these works _ now virtual icons of contemporary American
art _ were made after Pettibon had become the unofficial house
artist of L.A.'s nascent punk-rock scene, which Pettibon's older
brother, Gregory Ginn, helped invent as galvanizing lead guitarist
for the hard-core punk band Black Flag.
</P>
<P>
   They date from a period when none but a handful of art-world
cognoscente would've dreamed of paying $10,000 for a Pettibon
drawing, let alone honoring him with the massive retrospective,
organized by the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Renaissance
Society at the University of Chicago, that opens today at downtown
L.A.'s Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA).
</P>
<P>
   Scabrous and nostalgic, savagely incisive yet strangely tender,
Pettibon's works were as stunning for their sheer volume as for
their disquieting contents.
</P>
<P>
   To many longtime observers, they still are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray seemed to all of us a natural. Gifted, in the classic
sense. A prodigy,'' says MOCA's chief curator, Paul Schimmel, who
has known Pettibon since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could (borrow) from James Joyce and Jackie Robinson and put
'em together and just make something that was absolutely clear and
brilliant and lucid. And it's like, `Where did that come from?' And
that was something that I think (other) artists really were sort of
awestruck by. And in that respect, he is still a natural.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's deal with first things first: ``Raymond'' sounds too
formal and ``Mr. Pettibon'' (a family nickname Ray adopted years
ago) is simply ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   So call him Ray. Everyone does.
</P>
<P>
   He's a tall, gentle man with a gangly, minor-league pitcher's
build and a Byronic forelock dangling between shy, restless eyes.
His workday attire consists of khaki shorts, a tattered gray
T-shirt and paint-splattered tennis shoes which, depending on the
occasion, are optional.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Pettibon was born Raymond Ginn in Tucson, Ariz., in 1957
on Bloomsday, June 16. That's the date on which James Joyce set his
1922 novel ``Ulysses,'' the epic saga of a Dublin Everyman, Leopold
Bloom, who in the course of a single, 700-page day goes on a
perilous journey into selfhood and, returning home, achieves a
state of heroic grace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ulysses'' is one of many, many books strewn like autumn leaves
throughout the Ginn homestead, along with surfer magazines,
videotapes of tennis matches (John McEnroe is one of Ray's
collectors), hundreds of vinyl LPs (Frank Sinatra, Grandmaster
Flash, Donizetti's ``Lucia Di Lammermoor'') and any number of
discarded fast-food containers.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there are the drawings, hundreds of them,
stashed in bookcases, buried under mounds of kitchen debris,
peeking out from under furniture. There's an unruly orderliness to
the house, as if its walls long ago had ceased trying to contain
their inhabitants' free-wheeling creative energies, and had
resigned themselves to a kind of benign chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's crazy around here, some in one way, some in
another,'' says Ray's father, Regis Ginn, leading the way through
the kitchen.

Los Angeles:  leading the way through the kitchen.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Ginn family's faceless beige house sits inland from the
fancy ``ocean-view'' condos popping up around Hermosa Beach. Ray
resides here with his younger brother Adrian; his parents Oie and
Regis, a retired English teacher, U.S. Air Force colonel and author
of spy novels; two cocker spaniels, Vaguely Noble and Ohne Titel
(German for ``Untitled''); and a long-haired dachsund, Barely
Noble, recently salvaged from a rescue shelter.
</P>
<P>
   The dachsund is a particular favorite of Regis Ginn, who wanders
in and out of Ray's room, informing his son whenever he's wanted on
the phone and chattering with his grandson, Pee-wee.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the kids were always hard-working and smart,'' Ginn says.
``Ray was always drawing, just like this little brat (Pee-wee) is
always drawing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ginn family conversations tend to richochet at odd angles, like
the verbal fusilades in Pettibon's drawings. Bystanders, unsure if
they're witnessing teasing affection or something chillier,
occasionally may feel the urge to duck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you know Ray started out at UCLA as an economics major?''
Regis Ginn asks. ``He only did it because he could get his older
brother's books.'' The old man chuckles at this thought.
</P>
<P>
   Pettibon, overhearing, deflects his father's words.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, is that it?'' he mumbles. ``Oh, OK, whatever. Whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Pettibon has lived in Hermosa Beach virtually his
entire life, eschewing the hip artists' colonies of Venice and
downtown, he claims to harbor no deep affection for this aging hub
of working-class anomie, stranded between the Harbor Freeway and
the ocean void.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways it's a really creepy place, the mentality of the
people who live here,'' he says. ``You know the expression `not in
my back yard'? It's pretty intense in that. Here, the way I put it
is, there's no life from the shoulders up. And there's also this
really obnoxious racism.''
</P>
<P>
   Famously generous in his dealings with other artists, dealers
and curators, Pettibon is widely known and liked and receives many
visitors at home. He insists that his surroundings are
``irrelevant'' to his work. ``Being an artist, you're pretty much
on your own,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But MOCA's Schimmel sees a thread between Pettibon's choice of
residence and the youthful, ``unadulterated sort of pureness'' of
his art, which perpetually revisits themes and subjects from
America's past.
</P>
<P>
   ``He remembers his childhood, I think, better than most of us,
and somehow can, in some way, kind of go back to that place. I
think it's why he likes little kids. I think there's something very
nurturing to who he really is, by staying within the very sort of
specific confines of his childhood.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in this blue-collar crucible, and similar South Bay
enclaves, that the disillusioned younger siblings of beatniks and
hippies wrested rock 'n' roll from its complacency, stripped off
its tie-dyed veneer and created L.A punk.
</P>
<P>
   Black Flag, formed in 1977, forged the template for that angry,
mordantly ironic sound and do-it-yourself aesthetic, first with its
own albums, then through its SST Records label, which popularized
bands such as Minutemen, Husker Du and Meat Puppets.
</P>
<P>
   Pettibon, who contributed political cartoons to a student
newspaper while at UCLA, began illustrating Black Flag album covers
and promotional graphics in the late '70s. He continued through the
band's nihilistic heyday during the Reagan era.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, Pettibon also self-published the first of roughly 100
fanzines, including the serial dubbed ``Tripping Corpse,'' one of
whose covers featured a long-haired maniac lunging with
blood-smeared knives at an unseen victim.
</P>
<P>
   With these works, Pettibon articulated an alternative vision of
the Southern California idyll, echoing the ``sunshine and noir''
traditions of Raymond Chandler's detective novels, the Doors'
doom-rock, the besotted, elegiac prose of Charles Bukowski, and the
visual art of such local predecessors as Edward Kienholz, Ed Ruscha
and Mike Kelley.
</P>
<P>
   Pettibon's drawings were notes from a sun-addled underground, a
place where the 1967 ``Summer of Love'' gave way to the 1969
Altamont murder, where the Manson slayings, the Vietnam War, the
Patty Hearst kidnapping and the repression of student protests by
then-Gov. Ronald Reagan cast long shadows across orderly suburban
lawns.
</P>
<P>
   While Pettibon has been an anarchist ``since I was 13,'' he
stresses, ``that doesn't mean I'm some wild-eyed bomb thrower.''
Like others of his half-generation, he seems not to have bought
into the politics of either the left or right, but to endorse an
ideal of the radically free individual, uncensored and ultimately
answerable to his own inner moral compass.
</P>
<P>
   That spririt persists both in his art and in his view of what he
calls the current ``anti-youth mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The baby boomers who grew up, I think the fact that when they
were children and growing up as (products of) a free love and
politics, etc., they're more suspicious about their own children
than anyone,'' he says. ``You know (the '60s slogan), `Don't trust
anyone over 30'? Now it's the complete opposite. Now you're
considered, if not a criminal, a potential criminal just for being
young.''
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1980s, Pettibon had already materialized on the
art-world radar screen. But it probably wasn't until the 1992 MOCA
exhibition ``Helter-Skelter: L.A. Art in the 1990s'' that his
underground reputation went above ground for good.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it's hard to guess from his modest lifestyle that many of
Pettibon's drawings now fetch 10 or 20 times what they originally
did. Some coveted earlier works have sold for $5,000 apiece, and at
least one has gone for $10,000 at auction _ an enormous sum for a
single drawing.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Pettibon has yielded to his dealers' pleas not
to give away any more of his works for free. But his monetary
habits still might appear mercurial.
</P>
<P>
   On this particular morning, Ray has promised to take Pee-wee to
the local 7-Eleven in search of toy airplane gliders. En route,
they stop at another convenience store where Ray opts for a bag of
salted pumpkin seeds and Pee-wee settles on a ``Sudden Force
Military Play Equipment'' set, including a toy submachine gun,
grenade and mask. Ray pays for everything with a crisp $50 bill.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the house, Regis Ginn, now wearing a baseball cap with
the Air Force logo, is complaining about not being able to catch
Vaguely Noble to give him a bath. From the back yard suddenly comes
the pop! pop! of firecrackers being tossed from an upstairs deck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray's showing off now, I think,'' Regis says. ``That's why
this kid'll be in handcuffs before he's in third grade.''
</P>
<P>
   He means Pee-wee, who responds by pointing his new toy gun at
his grandfather. He pulls the trigger and spits out an imaginary
round.
</P>
<P>
   ``See, that's why he belongs in handcuffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Pettibon comes racing downstairs aiming make-believe
karate chops at his nephew. ``Kill the pigs!'' he yells.
</P>
<P>
   Pee-Wee aims and shoots at his uncle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friendly fire!'' Regis Ginn exclaims with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Ray grins. ``It's all friendly fire,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   You may ask yourself: How long can Pettibon maintain his
anarchic energy? How long can he keep seeing the world through
young eyes, now that he's a well-paid leader in the visual culture
of our time?
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed, and it still does, that this guy could wake up and
knock off 20 drawings,'' says MOCA's Schimmel, shaking his head in
wonder. ``It was just a kind of endless supply. I don't think it's
as endless as it once appeared to be _ maybe to him, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. For now, however, there is only the endless,
still-summery Pacific. Pettibon is meeting two artist friends to go
sailing to Catalina Island.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrives at the dock, the boat is ready and waiting. With
a half-smile, Raymond Pettibon waves goodbye, off on another
odyssey that, sooner or later, will lead him back home. &QL;

   IS LIGHTER SKIN AN ASSET OR A LIABILITY? Being a mestiza can be
a mixed blessing, writes Sabrina Margarita Alcantara-Tan, a
Pilipino American, in this article from A. magazine. Many Pilipinos
look on her paler complexion with envy, believing that it makes it
easier to assimilate into American society and to land a job. In
fact, her mother even encouraged her to marry a white man,
suggesting it would be ``easier on the children.'' On the other
hand, some fellow Pilipinos treat her as if she were ignorant of
her country's language and heritage, or even deny that she is a
``real Pilipina.''
</P>
<P>
   RACIAL FAVORITISM CAN LINGER ON AND ON _ EVEN IF YOU'RE BLACK.
Cheering on Serena Williams as she won the U.S. Open this summer,
Vernon Jarrett was conflicted. Was it racist for him to root for
Serena just because she was black, like him? The match meant so
much to him and other blacks that on the occasion of his son's
wedding they were sitting in front of the television urging her on.
In this column Jarrett recalls sports heroes of the past such as
Joe Louis and Jackie Robinson and how much their achievements meant
to him and other black Americans.
</P>
<P>
   LATINO BOYCOTT, NOT A GOOD TACTIC. When the television networks
announced their new fall schedule, Latino characters and Latino
actors were nonexistent in the 26 new shows. Latino activists and
commentators were startled at the absence of characters and
immediately complained to the networks and were ignored. A caucus
of Latino organizations is currently boycotting network television.
Boycotts by themselves are worthless unless coupled with economic
punishment. Raoul Lowery Contreras comments on the boycott and what
he feels is a better tactic.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S TIME TO EXHIBIT TRUE CHRISTIAN COURAGE. When the Rev. Jerry
Falwell, of recent Teletubby fame, has dinner next month with 200
gay people and their allies in his hometown, one topic of
conversation wills be anti-gay violence. Columnist Chuck Colbert
thinks that's a great idea and holds ``the potential for stemming a
shameful trend: ugly inflammatory rhetoric, leading to violent even
deadly action against people perceived to be gay, lesbian and
transgendered.'' The celebrated October dinner party came about
through the efforts of the Rev. Mel White, who used to be Falwell's
ghost writer. ``Mel sincerely wants to lower the rhetoric on both
sides. That is exactly what we want,'' Falwell told his hometown
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   A DRY WHITE EMMY SEASON. At the Emmy awards, two weeks ago,
several nominees, presenters and winners criticized the new TV
season, which has been dubbed ``a dry white season.'' Of the 26 new
series on ABC, NBC, CBS and FOX, only NBC's ``Third Watch''
features people of color in lead roles. The lack of actors of color
is a perennial problem. It should come as no surprise, then, that a
national coalition of Latino groups is calling for viewers to
boycott the networks from Sept. 12 through Sept. 26. ``It is time
for us all to diversify our lives. If television does not then
reflect that diversity, writers, producers, directors and actors
must try again. The industry and the actors need to start taking
action,'' writes columnist Akilah Monifa.

   IS LIGHTER SKIN AN ASSET OR A LIABILITY? Being a mestiza can be
a mixed blessing, writes Sabrina Margarita Alcantara-Tan, a
Pilipino American, in this article from A. magazine. Many Pilipinos
look on her paler complexion with envy, believing that it makes it
easier to assimilate into American society and to land a job. In
fact, her mother even encouraged her to marry a white man,
suggesting it would be ``easier on the children.'' On the other
hand, some fellow Pilipinos treat her as if she were ignorant of
her country's language and heritage, or even deny that she is a
``real Pilipina.''

   RACIAL FAVORITISM CAN LINGER ON AND ON _ EVEN IF YOU'RE BLACK.
Cheering on Serena Williams as she won the U.S. Open this summer,
Vernon Jarrett was conflicted. Was it racist for him to root for
Serena just because she was black, like him? The match meant so
much to him and other blacks that on the occasion of his son's
wedding they were sitting in front of the television urging her on.
In this column Jarrett recalls sports heroes of the past such as
Joe Louis and Jackie Robinson and how much their achievements meant
to him and other black Americans.
</P>
<P>
   LATINO BOYCOTT, NOT A GOOD TACTIC. When the television networks
announced their new fall schedule, Latino characters and Latino
actors were nonexistent in the 26 new shows. Latino activists and
commentators were startled at the absence of characters and
immediately complained to the networks and were ignored. A caucus
of Latino organizations is currently boycotting network television.
Boycotts by themselves are worthless unless coupled with economic
punishment. Raoul Lowery Contreras comments on the boycott and what
he feels is a better tactic.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S TIME TO EXHIBIT TRUE CHRISTIAN COURAGE. When the Rev. Jerry
Falwell, of recent Teletubby fame, has dinner next month with 200
gay people and their allies in his hometown, one topic of
conversation wills be anti-gay violence. Columnist Chuck Colbert
thinks that's a great idea and holds ``the potential for stemming a
shameful trend: ugly inflammatory rhetoric, leading to violent even
deadly action against people perceived to be gay, lesbian and
transgendered.'' The celebrated October dinner party came about
through the efforts of the Rev. Mel White, who used to be Falwell's
ghost writer. ``Mel sincerely wants to lower the rhetoric on both
sides. That is exactly what we want,'' Falwell told his hometown
newspaper.

   A DRY WHITE EMMY SEASON. At the Emmy awards, two weeks ago,
several nominees, presenters and winners criticized the new TV
season, which has been dubbed ``a dry white season.'' Of the 26 new
series on ABC, NBC, CBS and FOX, only NBC's ``Third Watch''
features people of color in lead roles. The lack of actors of color
is a perennial problem. It should come as no surprise, then, that a
national coalition of Latino groups is calling for viewers to
boycott the networks from Sept. 12 through Sept. 26. ``It is time
for us all to diversify our lives. If television does not then
reflect that diversity, writers, producers, directors and actors
must try again. The industry and the actors need to start taking
action,'' writes columnist Akilah Monifa.

BOY, CAN THIS KID FIDDLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROL BIDWELL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With his head down, a slight frown of
concentration on his face and his eyes focused on an imaginary
something only he can see, Tommy Drenten makes beautiful music.
</P>
<P>
   Sawing away with a pint-size horsehair bow on a half-adult-size
fiddle, the 11-year-old San Fernando Valley boy coaxes the sound of
generations of square dances, barn raisings and bluegrass
competitions out of the instrument.
</P>
<P>
   It's music America grew up on, and Tommy's growing up on it,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom used to always play Garth Brooks (songs), and I liked
that kind of music,'' Tommy said, lounging little boy-like with his
feet higher than his head after ripping through a half-dozen
toe-tapping tunes. ``I like to play blues sometimes, and bluegrass
with my dad. And I play a little gospel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to say he wanted to play with Garth Brooks in his
band, and that he would play for free,'' said Lorraine Drenten,
Tommy's mom, with a laugh. ``I told him, `When you get hired by
Garth Brooks, tell him you don't want any money. But tell him your
mother goes with you.' &UR;  &LR; '
</P>
<P>
   Tommy's interest in music was evident when he was only 3, fueled
by his mom's love of country music, the piano-playing talents of
his 12-year-old sister, Samantha, and the weekly jam sessions
hosted at home by his dad, Edward, an accountant who plays banjo
and bass fiddle.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't until he was 6 that he wanted to make music
himself.
</P>
<P>
   At a bluegrass festival at Lake Casitas, a Ventura County
gathering place for down-home music-makers, he stopped at a booth
selling fiddles. (A fiddle is the same as a violin, Tommy
explained. ``The only difference is the music that comes out of it.
A violin plays serious music. A fiddle plays bluegrass.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I hold one?'' he asked the vendor. Running his hands over
the smooth wood, he was intrigued. He didn't even try to play it,
but handed it back.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, he startled his parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I want to play the fiddle,' &UR;  &LR; '' Tommy recalled.
``They didn't think I was serious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it was a fluke,'' said his mom, a hairdresser.
``But he kept it up.''
</P>
<P>
   So they took him to see Frank Javorsek, whose Blue Ridge Pickin'
Parlor in the San Fernando Valley is a mecca for those who want to
learn to play a host of stringed instruments popular with bluegrass
and country music aficionados.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a feel for it from the beginning,'' said Javorsek. ``He
was playing simple tunes within a couple of weeks, and now he's
working on more difficult stuff. He's one of my better students,
but there's no end to the learning.''
</P>
<P>
   Most kids' parents push them to take lessons, whether the child
really wants to or not. But Tommy's one kid who has the fiddle in
his blood, who fiddles because he loves the sound the instrument
makes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done real well, but he's going to do even better,'' the
instructor predicted. ``If he sticks with it, he'll do real well.''
</P>
<P>
   With five years of weekly lessons under his belt, Tommy says
he's still learning the fine points of fiddling, even though he's
in demand to sit in with adult bands.
</P>
<P>
   At a local gig last winter, the pint-sized fiddler in jeans,
boots and wide-brimmed cowboy hat wowed an audience of several
hundred people when he appeared with a handful of adult
music-makers, all of them over 6 feet tall. The audience whistled
and applauded as Tommy, never lifting his head to scan the
audience, fiddled his way through song after song.
</P>
<P>
   He's also played a few benefits, a slew of parties, a couple of
weddings (``I got to play `Here Comes the Bride' and a lot of other
stuff''), opened last year's Santa Barbara Horse Show with ``The
Star-Spangled Banner,'' and even performed at the funeral of a
Kentucky native who lived next door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henry used to love to listen to Tommy play,'' said Lorraine
Drenten. ``He'd sit on his porch and listen by the hour, or he'd
come over here and say, `Get that fiddle goin' and make some
music.' And Tommy'd play for as long as he'd listen. Henry used to
say it reminded him of being back home.''
</P>
<P>
   Judges, too, have been captivated by the boy's playing. In 1997,
he took first place in the Junior Junior Division of the California
State Old Time Fiddlers Association competition in Bakersfield, and
a fourth place in competition at the Los Angeles County Fair. In
1998, he took first place in the Beginners Division at the CSOTFA
competition in Julian, Calif., and first for beginners in the 37th
Topanga Fiddle Contest and Folk Arts Festival.
</P>
<P>
   In February, he took first place in the Junior Beginning
category at a competition sponsored by the Bluegrass Association of
Southern California, and he's currently practicing for an Oct. 24
bluegrass contest sponsored by a Sun Valley church.
</P>
<P>
   He's never had stage fright, he bragged.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason, playing for a lot of people has never been a
big deal for me,'' Tommy said with a shrug, the picture of a calm,
cool professional.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad always gets nervous and when he gets out there. He
messes up. His hands shake. Why should I be nervous? They're just
people.''
</P>
<P>
   But he looks shamefaced as his mother reminds him of the first
time, a few years ago, he performed with an adult bluegrass band.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came time to play and he looked at me and said, `I think
I'm going to throw up,''' said Lorraine Drenten, laughing. ``But he
played anyway and did an awesome job.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the music starts, Tommy says, he forgets there's an
audience listening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like fast songs,'' he said, demonstrating his lickety-split
bowing. ``People like to dance and it makes me feel good to make
them feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets going really fast and everybody just whoops and
hollers,'' said his mom with a grin.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy is a sixth-grader at a Sherman Oaks middle school in the
San Fernando Valley, and when he's not studying or fiddling around,
he collects Pokemon cards, plays video games, watches ``The
Simpsons'' on TV, and rides his pony, Sizzle. And he's looking
forward to learning to play the drum set he got for his birthday in
July.
</P>
<P>
   Although his life now is filled with music, it's not something
he intends to make a living at. At least, right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be an NBA basketball player, probably for the
Lakers,'' he said, his eyes shining. ``Or design video games.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever he does is fine with his parents, as long as his grades
are respectable and he's happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tommy plays the fiddle, but he's into 99 other things,'' said
his mom. ``You have to let him be a kid.'' &QL;

 ROUGHING IT, '90s STYLE  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH DALEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDHOEK, Namibia _ New Hampshire software consultant Tom Doyle
refuses to spend more than $10 a night for a dorm bed in a hostel,
but he has no qualms about dropping $60 for dinner with a bottle of
dry white wine.
</P>
<P>
   It is a strange pattern of extreme economy and top-of-the-line
luxury that Doyle, 36, has created during a nine-month independent
tour of Africa: He hauls around a muck-covered blue canvas
knapsack, but inside are a pair of shiny black wingtips, a gold
tie, and dress pants for nights out.
</P>
<P>
   Once, Doyle would have been an anomaly; a richer, older outcast
in a rite of passage that lures thousands of twentysomethings to
see the world as completely and cheaply as possible between college
and career.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, Doyle often finds himself sharing a dorm room _
and perhaps a cognac _ with those his own age who are taking a
travel break during careers rather than before them. Hostel owners
say they are seeing a marked increase in the number of Americans,
Australians, and Europeans in their 30s and 40s backpacking through
Asia and Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The shift has led budget guidebooks to introduce pricier
categories, and hostel owners to create more private rooms for the
older, fussier traveler.
</P>
<P>
   These moves have brought new tensions to the adventure of the
backpacker trail.
</P>
<P>
   Younger, more traditional backpackers say the sense of community
they cherish in hostels is being lost as the richer backpackers use
the accommodations only to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``These new backpackers can take away from the communal aspect
of what these backpacker hostels started out as,'' complained
Lauren Robers, manager of Whale House Backpackers in Hout Bay, near
Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, she said, backpackers used the hostels as a
one-stop social outlet: An inexpensive place to sleep and meet
travelers from around the world to share adventures and traveling
tips. Meals are often cooked communally and conversations about
local customs and culture stretch long into the night. But older
backpackers, she said, often rent cars and flash credit cards to
ditch the hostel and fellow tourists for camel safaris or white
linen wine-tasting evenings in Cape Town's excellent wine regions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The double rooms people are building defeat the object of the
backpackers; the dorm rooms get people talking to each other,'' she
said. ``It's sort of a fight in the industry now. You can lose the
whole concept of the hostel. We try to keep it pure here.''
</P>
<P>
   The new backpackers say they want that same purity _ without the
same price restrictions. Doyle, the software consultant who
hitchhiked from a central South African town to Namibia with an
African family, spent one night sleeping in a car, another in his
tent, and the next in a four-star hotel in Cape Town. Still a
little dusty from the sandstorms that whip across the Namib Desert,
he said his trip was too valuable to scrimp on the luxuries when he
occasionally craved them.
</P>
<P>
   ``But at the same time I want reality, and it's not in these big
hotels. It took me my entire life to get to this trip, and I'm not
going to count pennies, although I do have to be careful,'' said
Doyle, lounging in his eight-person dorm room at the Cardboard Box
hostel in Windhoek. There for one night, he was searching for a
ride to Botswana.
</P>
<P>
   As people marry later, make more money earlier, and switch
careers more often, many are tapping into savings to have an
extended adventure before going back to the grind. Moreover,
companies that value their employees are bowing to their workers'
wanderlust by granting travel sabbaticals.
</P>
<P>
   Those travel patterns are being catered to by on-the-cheap
guidebooks that increasingly are giving more expensive options to
the more grown-up market. Lonely Planet guidebooks, which started
out by giving backpackers in the 1970s advice on how to travel in
foreign countries on shoestring budgets, now give accommodation and
restaurant advice from ``bottom end'' to ``top end'' which can mean
$150-plus per night room rates and $90 dinners.
</P>
<P>
   ``More of our challenge now is getting younger users to use our
books,'' said Carolyn Miller, marketing director of Lonely Planet
guides for the United States and Asia. ``Some people may be able to
afford a little something more . . . that's why we offer the
different options, but many still want that backpacker community
feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   These new travelers reject American chain hotels and higher-end
organized luxury tours, opting instead for the rough-and-real,
dormitory-style experience offered by youth hostels.
</P>
<P>
   Hostels, which now accept guests of any age, may not always have
hot running water or private rooms, but guests are virtually
guaranteed interesting conversation over coffee with like-minded
adventurers from Manhattan to Melbourne. The trade-off in comfort
is more than made up for in experience: These travelers would
rather spend big money on river-rafting than room service.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a trip like this, when you are older, you don't have to
totally scrimp. But you do have to choose your priorities on where
you want to spend your money,'' said Carrie Svingen of Somerville,
who left last month for an eight-month backpacking tour of
Indonesia and Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   A self-employed publicist in her mid-30s, Svingen went to
Indonesia last year for several weeks and fell in love with it. She
then sublet her apartment, asked her mother to mail her monthly
bill payments, let clients know she will return in mid-2000, and
boarded a plane. ``I didn't have a lot of responsibilities or
encumbrances, it was the right time to fulfill a dream,'' Svingen
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hostel owners are taking advantage of the increase in older
travelers and their occasional desire for a slightly nicer room. In
Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, the Shoestrings hostel still sees plenty
of young travelers, but is building and renovating single and
double rooms for slightly older travelers that may go for $13 a
night instead of $8.
</P>
<P>
   Catching rays of a late African sun on Shoestring's porch
recently, Simon Carles, 23, of London, said he has noticed the
communal kitchen at Shoestrings to be empty at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are older people here and they have their own way of
doing things,'' Carles, traveling for three months through South
Africa and Zimbabwe. ``I'm used to meeting people and learning
about who they are and where they've been. It still happens, but I
notice it's not as much.''
</P>
<P>
   Many older backpackers say the hostels still offer the communal
concept and international culture they seek. An occasional splurge
doesn't take away from that feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get more of the culture in the hostels, people talk to
each other,'' said Wayne Bonnett, 34, an accountant from New
Zealand. He and his fiancee, Rianne Joziasse, 28, of Holland,
traveled for eight months through southern Africa before being
married several weeks ago in Fiji.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle said he needs the hostel to both support the length of
time he is traveling, and his need to meet other travelers and have
the most cultural experience he can find.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't afford, and don't want, the luxury tour. This way I
have it all. I've had the most amazing time.''

SINGER MASQUERADES AS FICTITIOUS ROCK STAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: ``Tuesday'' refers to Sept. 28) 
By FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You get used to hearing superlatives around Garth
Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   Spend any time in his circle, and you'll pick up phrases like
``artist of the decade,'' ``more records sold in America than any
other artist,'' and even ``the greatest communicator of human
emotions'' repeated with straight, sometimes dour faces.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Brooks himself walks in wearing a pose of self-deprecation
designed to counteract all the platitudes he apparently insists on
in private.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at me,'' he says, patting his belly and running a hand
through gray, thinning hair. ``I'm 6-foot-1 and weigh 220 pounds.
Does this look like a rock star to you?''
</P>
<P>
   Complicated? Yup. And to make matters worse, you don't know if
you're talking to Brooks or his pseudonym, Chris Gaines, a
fictional Australian rocker who's the subject of an album, TV
special and planned feature film.
</P>
<P>
   Ready to give up? Don't _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   Pear-shaped, balding, superstitious about his success yet widely
feared inside a certain circular tower at Hollywood and Vine,
Brooks is the music business' own 600-pound gorilla.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, he single-handedly caused a restructuring of
Capitol's Nashville division. When he revealed he would morph into
Gaines, a pop, rock and r&AMP;b singer with a highly detailed fake
biography and non-existent back catalog, there were some puzzled
expressions around the old conference table.
</P>
<P>
   Only for a second, though. You can almost hear the chorus
kicking in: ``Great, Garth!'' ``You betcha!'' ``Can't wait _ let's
get it out for Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   And so they did. Brooks-as-Gaines' album, ``Garth Brooks ... in
the Life of Chris Gaines'' (Capitol), due Tuesday, is a Don
Was-produced 13-song ``greatest hits'' collection from a career
that never was.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks didn't write the songs, which touch on '80s rock and r&AMP;b
styles. Instead, the Nashville songwriting team of Gordon Kennedy,
Wayne Kirkpatrick and Tommy Simms (best-known for the Eric
Clapton/Babyface smash ``Change the World'') did the honors.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the Oklahoma-bred Brooks doesn't sound like his usual
``Friends in Low Places'' self on the record. In fact, he manages
to smooth out his country twang in favor of a rocker's falsetto and
r&AMP;b delivery.
</P>
<P>
   If you're dying to know more (and even if you're not), Gaines,
er, Brooks is going to blitz TV in the next few days, appearing on
``The Tonight Show With Jay Leno,'' ``The Rosie O'Donnell Show,''
``Late Night With Conan O'Brien,'' ``Today,'' ``Later Today'' and
``Showbiz Today'' between Monday and Wednesday, which is also the
day his NBC special based on the Gaines album airs.
</P>
<P>
   It's called promotion. Others call it synergy. At NBC's Gaines
taping last month, Pat Quigley, president of Capitol Nashville,
summed up, pointing out that Brooks was ``a Capitol artist on the
Sony studio lot making an NBC special for KIIS-FM listeners with
the president of Warner Bros. in the audience.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, when you've shifted more than 95 million units
and the Beatles are the only act to top your sales, the big guns
come out _ even when you've created something as odd and
potentially confusing to fans as Gaines.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Brooks says there's nothing to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a shift, it's a stretch,'' the soft-spoken superstar
says after the taping, wearing a backward baseball cap and Nike
T-shirt. ``The character came to life, and I thought, `Why not?'
But the true thing is the music _ that's the thing that really
kills me, and I'm proud of that, so we'll see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for the project, Brooks went on a diet, donning wig
and makeup to give Gaines a face for the album cover.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Gaines is apparently a hit, while ``Lost in You,'' the
r&AMP;b-tinged first single, has moved Brooks into new territory. In
the pop and new adult contemporary radio format, the song was the
No. 1 most-added recently while continuing its climb up the plain
old adult contemporary and Top 40 charts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, country stations, including influential local outlet
KZLA-FM (93.9), are playing the more straightforward album track,
``It Don't Matter to the Sun.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is, are people simply digging the tunes, or are
they buying the whole Garth-as-Gaines persona?
</P>
<P>
   ``Our listeners are big fans of Garth, no matter what he does,
or who he says he is,'' said Marida Petitjean, KZLA's operations
manager. ``If you love Garth, you're gonna love his album, because
you love him. I don't know if the audience has put two and two
together and realized there's this alter ego. They'll probably be
surprised when they figure it out, because it hasn't been fully
explained to his core country audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, who likes to refer to himself in the third person as if
he were an imaginary character like Gaines, has agreed to cut one
more Gaines disc, the soundtrack to the planned film of ``The
Lamb.'' If these records are hits, he could go off the deep end _
and cut the five albums that supposedly predate Tuesday's
``greatest hits'' effort.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks isn't 100 percent positive his massive fan base is going
to take the plunge with him. And he's not going to tour as Gaines,
because he doesn't trust his fans not to demand ``If Tomorrow Never
Comes,'' ``The Dance'' and other Garth chartbusters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key word is gonna be education to give the buyer the most
information they can to make the best decision they can,'' he said,
sounding like a marketing director rather than a singer-songwriter.
``I have to take the fear away that this is some place where Garth
is gonna leave everything else behind. And if they just realize
it's a ride we can go on, we'll all have fun. If they don't bite,
well, I can't really complain after what they've given me over the
past decade.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gaines character will be seen in the planned Paramount film,
with Brooks and Babyface serving as co-producers. The film is still
in the writing stages, and casting is up in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure I'm going to be in the movie,'' Brooks, 37, says.
``I don't have gorgeous movie-star looks. I'm not that gorgeous
guy. If the director can get past the fact it's me _ so people in
the theaters won't be saying: `What's Garth Brooks doing in the
middle of this movie?' _ then hopefully there'll be something for
me to do in it. But it's not going to be a Rutles or Spinal
Tap-type thing.''
</P>
<P>
   When performing the rock-oriented ``Chris Gaines'' material for
Wednesday's NBC special, Brooks says he felt like a kid practicing
rock-star moves in front of a mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I play country, I don't feel like Hank Williams or George
Jones or Merle Haggard,'' he said. ``Those guys are gods. So with
rock, I didn't expect to go out there and feel like Steven Tyler. I
felt like a guy playing music who wishes he could feel like Steven
Tyler or Freddie Mercury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rock 'n' roll is hip, and hip is not how I would describe me.
Never has been. It's not a state of humbleness, it's just a state
of honesty. I just never thought hip was my thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not _ even if he is a superstar. Hipness isn't gauged by
how many records you sell. But if his latest gambit works, Brooks
could well make some real Gaines as an artist. &UR;  &QL; 
 &QL;

THE `HISTORY' OF CHRIS GAINES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Runs with GARTH-BROOKS mainbar) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Just who is Chris Gaines, the fictional rock star
Garth Brooks portrays on his new album?
</P>
<P>
   Well, according to his extensive fake bio, his full name is
actually Christian Gene Gaines, born Aug. 10, 1967, in Brisbane,
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   His father was Gene Gaines, a former swim coach for Long Beach
State University and former coach of both U.S. and Australian
Olympic swim teams. His mom was Carolyn Johnns-Gaines, a former
swimmer for Australia's Olympic team and a Commonwealth Games
medalist.
</P>
<P>
   The family moved to Los Angeles when only-child Chris was 5.
While expected to follow his parents in athletic pursuits, he
instead developed an interest in music and dropped out of
Morningside High School in his senior year to pursue it
professionally.
</P>
<P>
   His first success came when Gaines and pal Tommy Levitz, plus
Marc Obed, formed the band Crush, signed by Capitol in 1985. The
band's debut album was released the following year, and the second
single from the record, ``My Love Tells Me So,'' became one of
1986's top sellers.
</P>
<P>
   After Levitz perished in a plane crash that same year, Gaines
began work on his solo debut, ``Straight Jacket,'' released in
1989. The album spent 224 weeks on the Billboard Top 200, earning a
Grammy Award for album of the year. Hits included ``Maybe,''
``White Flag'' and ``Digging for Gold,'' while the album remains
Gaines' most popular effort.
</P>
<P>
   A year after his father's death in 1990, Gaines' dark-themed
sophomore album, ``Fornucopia,'' was issued, spending 18 weeks on
the Billboard charts. The disc included a remake of the 1972 Ramsay
Sellers classic ``It Don't Matter to the Sun'' and ``Main Street,''
which became a hit.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1992, Gaines was involved in a car crash that nearly did
him in. Following six weeks in the hospital, he underwent two years
of plastic surgery on his face, shoulder and hands.
</P>
<P>
   Like a rock-era Garbo, Gaines didn't allow himself to be seen or
photographed, and Capitol released his third solo album,
``Apostle,'' in 1994. It spent two months on the albums chart,
spawning the singles ``Way of the Girl'' and ``Unsigned Letter.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Gaines launched a comeback in 1996 with the album
``Triangle.'' The media dubbed him ``the New Prince'' because of
his look and the r&AMP;b slant in his new music. Hits included
``Driftin' Away,'' ``That's the Way I Remember It'' and ``Snow in
July.''
</P>
<P>
   And that brings us to this Tuesday, when Brooks-as-Gaines
releases the ``greatest hits'' album ``Garth Brooks ... in the Life
of Chris Gaines,'' featuring the hits listed above plus two new
cuts, ``Lost in You'' and ``Right Now.''
</P>
<P>
   The album will supposedly act as a bridge between the early work
and a new solo disc, ``The Lamb,'' already being called the
``definitive album of the new millennium.'' &QL;

HALF-HOUR `ALLY' EPISODES JUST FILLING TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By DAVID KRONKE 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The most impressive thing about reformatting
hourlong episodes of ``Ally McBeal'' into bite-size, half-hour
chunks called ``Ally'' is that it can be done with any sense of
comprehensibility at all. That it can be done, of course, doesn't
mean it should.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ally Lite'' basically extracts one of the subplots that worked
in tandem with other story lines on past episodes of David E.
Kelley's perky, Emmy-winning comic concoction and forces it to
stand on its own. What the people overseeing this prime-time
experiment seem to have overlooked is that the reason such stories
were only used as complements to an overall hourlong episode is
because they don't necessarily hold up alone.
</P>
<P>
   Of three episodes made available for screening, only one _
Ally's wacky confrontation with the Pringles lady and her
subsequent hearing on charges of instability _ passes muster as a
viable tale. The others _ Ally saves an obese man's life, then must
fend off his romantic overtures; Ally referees a romantic spat
between a minister and a choir leader, which causes her to reflect
on her own miserable love life _ simply feel thin and truncated.
What's most noticeable in ``Ally'' is what's missing _ the
accumulation of Kelley-created quirky moments that lead to an
emotional payoff at the end.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, to pad the episodes to the appropriate length,
there's all sorts of twee nonsense, from an excess of meaningless
establishing shots, to gobs of footage either choppily edited or
sped up (people were no doubt getting sick of cutesy overuse of
fast-motion back in film's silent era). Music figures in a lot,
too; too much for a half-hour show, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   Why would Kelley even bother with this, especially given the
fact that he currently has four other shows on the air? Apparently,
he's noticed that when it comes to syndication, he's getting a raw
deal _ even middling sitcoms pull in bigger bucks than his
acclaimed hour-long series. When average viewers channel-surf,
they're more likely to agree to waste a half-hour of their lives on
an old sitcom they liked than fritter away an entire hour on a
drama.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley's gambit, however, comes at a time when sitcoms are on
the wane _ the only decent new one of the fall season, ``Action,''
is getting awful ratings _ and Kelley himself has been a pioneer in
the hourlong comedy genre. With luck, that may translate into
syndication success down the line, as well.
</P>
<P>
   It boils down to this: ``Ally McBeal'' is a phenomenon that
spoke to the Zeitgeist; ``Ally's'' just a way to kill some time. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The show: ``Ally.'' &QL; 
What: A slenderer ``Ally McBeal,'' if that's possible. &QL; 
Who: Calista Flockhart, Gil Bellows, Courtney Thorne-Smith, Lisa
Nicole Carson, Jane Krakowski, Greg Germann. &QL; 
Where: Fox (Channel 11). &QL; 
When: 8 tonight. &QL; 
Rating: 2 1/2 stars &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Russia, it seems, is not the only part of the former communist
world where large injections of western money have fostered
corruption rather than promoting reform.
</P>
<P>
   In Bosnia, four years of intensive care by well-wishers, and
over $5 billion-worth of aid, have failed to create either a
self-sustaining economy or the sort of interdependence among its
feuding ethnic groups that would make a return to war unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators from the American House of Representatives
recently found evidence that hundreds of millions of dollars given
for reconstruction had been misappropriated. Soft loans and corrupt
procurement practices had been used to enrich Bosnia's ruling party
and its cronies, under the noses of western envoys.
</P>
<P>
   Even the money earmarked to provide gravestones for the
thousands of people massacred at Srebrenica in July 1995 had been
stolen.
</P>
<P>
   With criminal revenues like this, there is little wonder that
Bosnia's politicians have shown scant interest in creating an
economy that might one day stand on its own feet.
</P>
<P>
   But the Balkan countries do not have to go on like this. NATO's
victory in Kosovo, and the outside world's well-intentioned, if
sometimes clumsy, efforts to help the province back on to its feet
have opened up some historic opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   For better or worse, new economic and geopolitical facts are
being created. Within the next few months, it will become clear
whether the western world is learning from the Bosnian experience
and aiming for something more ambitious than the mere avoidance of
renewed war.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, the West has two choices. It can rely solely on
compacts with the region's existing power brokers, which often
means conniving at, or even reinforcing, the corrupt practices by
which they shore up their own authority and squash the emergence of
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Or it can work to undermine the current power structure, with
huge potential benefits for the region's people.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of that structure _ especially in Bosnia, Serbia
and Albania _ lie venal customs services whose inspectors owe more
loyalty to mobsters and warlords than to governments. These
services quite literally create ``barriers to entry'' for
legitimate manufacturers and traders who lack the necessary
connections in the world of politics and crime.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever possible, western governments should be urging Balkan
ones to dismantle all barriers to legal trade, and concentrate
their efforts on forms of commerce that do need be reined in: the
trade in drugs, guns and prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   If that means temporarily compensating governments for the loss
of customs revenue, so be it. But instead of throwing more money at
the region than its economies can honestly absorb, the European
Union, in particular, should think harder about opening up markets:
its own, as well as the region's.
</P>
<P>
   Such a policy could create a virtuous circle. It might be
easier, for example, to stop Macedonia levying huge sums on the
vehicles ferrying reconstruction materials to the Kosovars if its
own industrial products were flowing more freely to European
markets.
</P>
<P>
   It could be easier to stop the farmers of southern Albania
producing drugs if there were some other crop they were allowed to
supply to European consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The politicians and smugglers of Montenegro, a notorious haven
for contraband, may at last be willing to ``go straight'' _ but
only if they have some legitimate outlet for their talents.
</P>
<P>
   The last thing West European governments should worry about is
the ``threat'' posed by cheap Balkan food or industrial
manufactures to their own producers.
</P>
<P>
   In one form or another, the desperation and poverty of the
Balkans will affect the lives of many people in more prosperous
places. They are already doing so in the shape of prostitution
rackets and the proliferation of small arms on the streets of Milan
and London; in southern Italy, convoys of Balkan smugglers brazenly
travel about in armor-plated vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   It is naive to imagine that either NATO's bombs, or huge sums of
poorly supervised aid money, will be sufficient to keep at bay the
potentially malign consequences of Balkan misery for Europe as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
   How much better that the ``Balkan effect'' should be felt in the
form of legitimate exports which flow through the region, and
beyond it, without impediment. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   When The Economist described America's economy as a bubble in
April 1998 and advised Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve's
chairman, to raise interest rates to pop it, many people dismissed
our warnings.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Dow is even higher than it was, the economy is
enjoying robust growth and the core rate of consumer-price
inflation has fallen to a 33-year low.
</P>
<P>
   So were we wrong? Sorry to be party poopers, but America's
economy still looks horribly bubble-like.
</P>
<P>
   A drop in share prices this week, as central bankers and finance
ministers gathered for the annual meetings of the IMF and the World
Bank, was a timely reminder that a collapse on Wall Street remains
the biggest threat to the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   Not convinced? Consider the three most common criticisms of the
idea that there is a financial bubble.
</P>
<P>
   First, it is argued, higher share prices are justified by
improved fundamentals. In a month that has seen the publication of
three books with progressively ambitious titles _ ``Dow 36,000,''
``Dow 40,000'' and ``Dow 100,000'' _ it seems churlish to quibble.
</P>
<P>
   But the climb in share prices over the past year proves neither
that the market is correctly valued nor that the bubble is a
figment of our imagination.
</P>
<P>
   History shows that markets do overshoot and that bubbles can
persist for some time _ indeed, that is their nature. It also shows
that the bigger a bubble gets, the greater the excesses it creates
in the economy _ and the bigger the bang when it eventually pops.
</P>
<P>

deficits and current-account deficits.

   Greenspan has worried long and hard about share prices since his
``irrational exuberance'' speech in December 1996, but he seems to
have concluded that there was nothing he could do.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Partly, perhaps, because of the third popular criticism of
our bubble thesis: that it is too risky, both economically and
politically, for a central bank to prick a bubble by raising
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to tell when and by how much rates should be raised.
And the Fed, like other central banks, has a mandate only to
deliver stability in consumer prices. If the Fed deliberately tried
to push down share prices, it would quickly come under fierce
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Deciding when to prick a bubble is indeed devilishly hard. But
that is no reason for inaction. Instead, it argues for acting
preemptively to prevent a bubble inflating in the first place _ as
the Bank of England recently tried to do by raising interest rates
in response to rising house prices, even though inflation was below
its target.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank sensibly wants to prevent a repeat of the late-1980s
housing bubble. And its action also belies the claim that it is
politically impossible to raise interest rates without hard
evidence of rising inflation.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Greenspan has been taking a big risk by not
having tightened policy when he first thought a bubble might be
forming, or subsequently.
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of signs of overheating, such as rampant
consumer borrowing, that he could have used to justify higher
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   His second risky move was to cut rates three times last autumn
in response to financial turmoil, when policy was already lax, and
then to fail to take back this easing as soon as financial markets
had stabilized.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has thereby fostered the impression that it will slash
interest rates when share prices fall sharply, but not increase
rates when they shoot up. This apparent asymmetry has created a
form of moral hazard that encourages investors to take bigger
risks.
</P>
<P>
   What should the Fed do now? Trapped by the bubble, Greenspan's
room for maneuver is limited. Perhaps Wall Street will slide slowly
downwards, letting air gently out of the bubble. But history
suggests that this is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   America's economy shows no sign of slowing; July's record trade
deficit confirms that strong consumer spending is sucking in
imports. Unless share prices collapse, the Fed should raise
interest rates again to cool things down and to signal that it is
not underwriting the market's value.
</P>
<P>
   If it does nothing, the Fed runs the risk that, when Wall Street
does eventually fall, inflation will be rising and the dollar
falling, making it harder to ease monetary policy to offset the
effects of a crash.
</P>
<P>
   One bonus is that the rest of the world economy is in a much
healthier state now than it was a year ago. By the same token, a
sharp fall on Wall Street may be less of a worry.
</P>

vital that policymakers in Europe and Japan ensure that their
economies pick up the extra slack.

refusal to ease monetary policy even as America's economy stalled,
the world economy would take a nasty tumble.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When The Economist described America's economy as a bubble in
April 1998 and advised Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve's
chairman, to raise interest rates to pop it, many people dismissed
our warnings.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Dow is even higher than it was, the economy is
enjoying robust growth and the core rate of consumer-price
inflation has fallen to a 33-year low.
</P>
<P>
   So were we wrong? Sorry to be party poopers, but America's
economy still looks horribly bubble-like.
</P>
<P>
   A drop in share prices this week, as central bankers and finance
ministers gathered for the annual meetings of the IMF and the World
Bank, was a timely reminder that a collapse on Wall Street remains
the biggest threat to the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   Not convinced? Consider the three most common criticisms of the
idea that there is a financial bubble.
</P>
<P>
   First, it is argued, higher share prices are justified by
improved fundamentals. In a month that has seen the publication of
three books with progressively ambitious titles _ ``Dow 36,000,''
``Dow 40,000'' and ``Dow 100,000'' _ it seems churlish to quibble.
</P>
<P>
   But the climb in share prices over the past year proves neither
that the market is correctly valued nor that the bubble is a
figment of our imagination.
</P>
<P>
   History shows that markets do overshoot and that bubbles can
persist for some time _ indeed, that is their nature. It also shows
that the bigger a bubble gets, the greater the excesses it creates
in the economy _ and the bigger the bang when it eventually pops.
</P>
<P>
   It is, in truth, impossible to know whether share prices are
overvalued right now. But over the past year or so, evidence of a
bubble has mounted with every sign of excess elsewhere in the
economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Babies should be a reason for joy. Instead, the arrival of the 6
billionth member of humanity some time around now is being greeted
with gloom.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) worries that the
fastest growth is in the poorest countries. A new study financed by
Cornell University frets that 12 billion people will suffer
miserably by 2100.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the days of Malthus, demography seems to have
inspired despondency. At a local level, in overcrowded places, such
gloom can be justified.
</P>
<P>
   In 50 or 100 years' time, however, most countries are more
likely to worry about the lack of babies than the excess. For there
is now a serious possibility, encapsulated in the lowest of three
projections made by the U.N., that world population growth will
stabilize by around 2040 at about 7.5 billion _ and then start to
decline.
</P>
<P>
   Improbable? Economists have predicted a birth dearth before, on
the eve of the Second World War, and been wrong. But fertility
decline is now universal and rapid. Repeatedly, the U.emographers have revised down their population projections.
</P>
<P>
   In the rich world, the fall in fertility has had much attention:
in 61 countries, it is at or below replacement rate, implying an
eventual fall in population. But the change has occurred even
faster in poor countries. Since 1969, developing countries have
seen fertility fall from six children per woman to three.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, the effect of this astonishing trend has been
disguised by the fact that the number of women of childbearing age
has almost doubled, and that child survival and the average life
span have both risen.
</P>
<P>
   It will be clearer around 2010 when, if the U.N.'s ``low
fertility'' projection turns out to be the right one, the number of
babies born into the world will fall below the number needed for
replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Making long-term projections, even demographic ones, for such
things is notoriously hazardous. And many of the immediate
problems, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, will continue to be
those of growth, not decline.
</P>
<P>
   But with so much emphasis on the notion of an explosion, it is
well worth contemplating the opposite, and now at least as likely,
development: what Nicholas Eberstadt, an American demographer,
calls a ``population implosion.''
</P>
<P>
   If the low-fertility projection were to come about, the median
age of the world's population, close to 20 at the start of this
century, would rise to more than 40 by the middle of the next
century. In Germany and Japan, where the median age is already
almost 40, it would pass 50.
</P>
<P>
   The rich countries are already fretting about the implications
for public pensions, health care and the job market. Some are
embroiled in political rows over provision for the old: Germany's
government is trying to restrain pension promises, Britain's
pensioners have begun to clamor for more cash.
</P>
<P>
   Such clashes between young and old seem unimaginable in the
developing world. With the main exception of China, which has been
loosening its one-child policy to try to boost the numbers of
youngsters, poor countries have given barely a thought to what lies
ahead. Yet many will grow old long before they grow rich enough to
care for a growing army of grey heads.
</P>
<P>
   Caring for granny will be the most obvious consequence of an
aging planet. A more subtle but equally profound change will be in
the structure of the family.
</P>
<P>
   The chances are that today's 6 billionth child will enjoy two or
three siblings, a bevy of adoring aunts and uncles, a clutch of
cousins.
</P>
<P>
   Baby number 7,500,000,000 is more likely to be an only child,
with few relatives of her own generation.
</P>
<P>
   Will all this happen? At this stage, no one can know. But with
fertility rates in rapid decline, the debate about the global birth
rate is now over when, not whether, it will fall below replacement
level.
</P>
<P>
   Some countries will remain preoccupied with birth control. But
in many others, attention will have to switch to finding ways to
provide for old folk when families can no longer do the job. &QL;

THE SIBLING RIVALRY OF AL GORE AND BILL BRADLEY

 c.1999 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The contest between Al Gore and Bill Bradley has some of the
bitterness of sibling rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   Although they have certain policy differences, at root theirs is
a clash of personalities, not of backgrounds or beliefs. They are
like members of a family who exhibit the same characteristics in
different and hostile guises.
</P>
<P>
   Consider their styles. Both are self-confident and wooden. Their
stump speeches are models of dullness. Neither has faltered in his
desire to be president. They trundle towards one other
relentlessly, like tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Gore's determination has a controlled, disciplined character
about it. Perhaps because he has spent so long in a White House
under perpetual attack, or perhaps because as the front-runner he
has so much to lose even from a single gaffe, he has become
habitually defensive and restrained.
</P>
<P>
   Listeners respect, but do not warm to, his slick and competent
speeches. He seems to be sticking to a script someone else has
written.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's uncharismatic relentlessness has a different quality.
He too is sticking to a script _ but one he has written himself,
obscurities and all. His low-key nonchalance, the opposite of
slick, comes across as unvarnished sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   His introspective manner, his maddening refusal not to speak
about the big issues yet, even his decision to run for the
presidency now, when he claims he ``is ready,'' rather than
earlier, when it might have been politically more convenient _ all
these suggest an unflashy but deep self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is even beginning to display, on the evidence of last
weekend, an unexpected talent for good humor on television.
</P>
<P>
   The two men also display different forms of a more admirable
quality: integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has avoided most of the sleaze of the Clinton White House
(though not a certain part of the blame for it). He was a dutiful
son of a senator and is now a stalwart of the moderate wing of the
Democratic Party. His is the integrity of the loyal vice-captain.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's is that of the high-minded independent. He is a man
who, first as senator and now as candidate, likes to carve out a
position on matters that appeal to him and pursue it with dour
scrupulousness.
</P>
<P>
   He is not necessarily loyal. He resigned from the Senate in
1996, abandoning to others the task of defending the Democrats from
the then-rampant Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   He even flirted, a year earlier, with leaving the party, saying
that ``politics is broken'' and complaining that ``neither
political party speaks to people where they live their lives.'' It
is impossible to imagine such words coming from Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast between the two men has a bearing on how voters
think they would do one of the most important jobs of a president:
that of commander-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
   More than any other world leader, the American president must
show good judgment in matters of war and peace. Bradley scores
better (on an admittedly tiny sample) in this dragon-slaying test.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'll make an exceptional commander-in-chief,'' says
Bob Kerrey, the only senator to have backed Bradley so far.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has 14 senators in his camp but not one has used this form
of praise in their endorsements. This does not mean that Gore would
be a bad commander-in-chief, but it does suggest that his
supporters do not associate him with the qualities that are needed
when American soldiers have to go into the line of fire.
</P>
<P>
   Now consider the policies of the two men. Both are pushing for a
more energetic and intrusive role for government than anything
Clinton has offered since the Republican landslide of 1994. But
Gore's activism comes in the shape of a swarm of small reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Putting limits on urban sprawl, employing more teachers to cut
class sizes, expanding health insurance for children _ all these
are one cautious step beyond Clintonian micro-initiatives, such as
encouraging school uniforms or boosting parental leave.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Bradley's governmental activism is that of the
broad brush. He wants much tougher gun controls, universal health
care and an overhaul of the campaign-finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   These last two would require nothing less than defeating the
special-interest groups that cling to the status quo and changing
the way the government works.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is an incrementalist, though his many small policies would
add up to a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley wants to transform politics through a few bold strokes.
He is the John McCain of the left _ an outsider with inside
knowledge, determined to clean up a corrupt political system.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Bill Bradley seems more gawkily sympathetic as a man,
higher-minded as a leader and bolder as a policymaker. These
qualities explain why he is now running neck-and-neck with Al Gore
in all sorts of recent opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   But can he win the nomination? That is a different matter. To be
nominated (and to be an effective president) requires
wheeler-dealer skills as well _ the ability to maintain a network
of allies and a knowledge of political trench warfare. In this
respect, Gore has the advantage.
</P>
<P>
   When Bradley was in the Senate, he gained a reputation as the
sort who sees the big picture but overlooks his constituents'
parochial concerns. This has helped him widen his appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Over one-third of Republicans say they would consider voting for
him, a much higher share than would dream of choosing Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But the vice-president has cemented support within his own party
so successfully that he has almost shut Bradley out. Most
Democratic officials support him, and they alone have a fifth of
the vote at the party convention.
</P>
<P>
   Among black voters, two prefer Gore for every one who prefers
Bradley. And in the South, a recent Gallup poll suggested that 72
percent of Democrats support Gore and only 19 percent Bradley. The
vice-president has a big advantage in states that control about a
third of the delegates.
</P>
<P>
   A Gore nomination is not yet a foregone conclusion. Bradley's
success is creating uncertainty among Democratic voters, and is
nourishing the view that he would be better than Gore at winning
Republican and independent votes.
</P>
<P>
   But the delegate arithmetic is powerful. The Democratic race is
evolving into a contest between the man better placed to win the
presidency and the one who is far more likely to win the
nomination. &QL;

qualities explain why he is now running neck-and-neck with Al Gore
in all sorts of recent opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   But can he win the nomination? That is a different matter. To be
nominated (and to be an effective president) requires
wheeler-dealer skills as well _ the ability to maintain a network
of allies and a knowledge of political trench warfare. In this
respect, Gore has the advantage.
</P>
<P>
   When Bradley was in the Senate, he gained a reputation as the
sort who sees the big picture but overlooks his constituents'
parochial concerns. This has helped him widen his appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Over one-third of Republicans say they would consider voting for
him, a much higher share than would dream of choosing Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But the vice-president has cemented support within his own party
so successfully that he has almost shut Bradley out. Most
Democratic officials support him, and they alone have a fifth of
the vote at the party convention.
</P>
<P>
   Among black voters, two prefer Gore for every one who prefers
Bradley. And in the South, a recent Gallup poll suggested that 72
percent of Democrats support Gore and only 19 percent Bradley. The
vice-president has a big advantage in states that control about a
third of the delegates.
</P>
<P>
   A Gore nomination is not yet a foregone conclusion. Bradley's
success is creating uncertainty among Democratic voters, and is
nourishing the view that he would be better than Gore at winning
Republican and independent votes.
</P>
<P>
   But the delegate arithmetic is powerful. The Democratic race is
evolving into a contest between the man better placed to win the
presidency and the one who is far more likely to win the
nomination. &QL;

<P>
   SYDNEY _ Officials have long described East Timor as the one
``thorn'' in Australia's relations with Indonesia, its closest
neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   If East Timor's independence referendum on Aug. 30 went
smoothly, it was argued, the thorn would be plucked out: Australia
and Indonesia would be headed for a bright future as regional
partners.
</P>
<P>
   The slaughter carried out in East Timor since the ballot by
pro-Indonesia militias, with the blessing of the army, has left
Australia's policymakers shocked and its relations with its
northern neighbor in tatters.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of embarking on a new partnership with Indonesia,
Australian soldiers are leading an international force to bring
peace to East Timor. They are facing a possibly hostile Indonesian
army, and Australia is being abused in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 21, Indonesia's president, B.J. Habibie, accused
Australia of being ``excessive and unhelpful,'' and said his
government ``deplores the stance of Australia.''
</P>
<P>
   John Howard, the Australian prime minister, told a special
sitting of Parliament that the country's relations with Indonesia
were under ``great strain.''
</P>
<P>
   This was an understatement. The chaos in East Timor has
presented Australia with its biggest foreign-policy and defense
crisis since the Vietnam War 30 years ago _ some would say since
the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Dibb, the head of strategic and defense studies at the
Australian National University, and formerly one of the architects
of Australian foreign policy, says, ``We're now in an era of
discontinuity. All the givens are gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The givens for Australia have rested on two blocks: the American
alliance, born of the Cold War, and an engagement with Asia,
stemming from a need to tame old Australian fears about invasion
from the north.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Indonesia has been central to Australia's Asian
attentions, sometimes obsessively so. The overcrowded archipelago _
whose population, the world's fourth-biggest, is 11 times
Australia's _ lies close to the underpopulated expanses of ``the
lucky country.''
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia has never shown any inclination to expand into
Australia, but many Australians remain nervous of the idea, never
more so than now.
</P>
<P>
   Australia turned a blind eye when Indonesia invaded East Timor
in 1975, after Portugal, the colonial power, had bolted. Australia
then became the only western country to recognize Indonesia's claim
of sovereignty over East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Appeasing Indonesia rather than making a fuss about its
brutality in East Timor was the order of the day.
</P>
<P>
   A review in 1986 of Australia's defense capabilities by Dibb
served to reinforce the policy. It argued that any military threat
to Australia was most likely to come from or through the Indonesian
archipelago, which lies across vital air and sea lanes, but that
such a threat was likely to be remote as long as Indonesia was
stable.
</P>
<P>
   Australia's former Labor government put much effort into keeping
Indonesia stable. Paul Keating, prime minister from 1991 to 1996,
counted ex-President Suharto, Indonesia's dictatorial leader at the
time, as a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Keating's government signed a security treaty with Indonesia in
1995. It involved a degree of cooperation between the two
countries' armed forces that many Australians found uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   All that now counts for nothing. The fall of the Suharto regime
last year, and the violence that swept through East Timor before
the ballot, caught Australia's conservative coalition government by
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   It was Howard who had written to Habibie in December suggesting
a process of self-determination for East Timor. This was seen as a
bid by Australia to expedite the removal of the East Timorese
thorn. It has not worked.
</P>
<P>
   Howard's critics, mainly among the pro-Indonesia lobby, say the
referendum should never have been held, certainly not until
democracy was more strongly established in Indonesia itself.
</P>
<P>
   If the government had been prepared to wait, argues Rawdon
Dalrymple, a former Australian ambassador to Indonesia and the
United States, ``we would not now have found ourselves truly and
definitively the odd man out in the region.''
</P>
<P>
   As if to emphasize how far out, Indonesia on Sept. 16 cancelled
the security treaty that Australia thought would bring the two
countries together in a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie's adviser on foreign affairs, Dewi Fortuna Anwar, a
young woman educated at an Australian university, said Australian
troops would be ``singled out'' as targets by militias and
Indonesian soldiers in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   The debacle has also exposed Australia to a new reality over its
other foreign-policy block, the American alliance. Howard asked
President Bill Clinton to commit ``boots on the ground'' to the
United Nations force, meaning troops.
</P>
<P>
   It was a request more appropriate to the Cold War, when
Australia supported the United States with troops in Korea and
Vietnam, than to an era when the Americans expect allies to pull
their own weight in their own regions.
</P>
<P>
   Australia is stretching itself to the limit by committing 4,500
troops to East Timor; America has offered 200 logistical personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Australia's relations with Indonesia will take years to recover.
Already, Howard has proposed spending more on defense, and he is
cautious about making Australia an Asian power, as Keating seemed
to be ready to do. ``Foreign policy needs to be based on national
interest and on our values,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Dibb suggests East Timor will be a turning-point for
Australia's assessment of its place in the world: ``We are now more
alone than we have been probably at any time since the 1930s.'' &QL;

   JOHANNESBURG _ Sun, surf, seafood and sauvignon blanc are not,
it seems, enough. To entice visitors to Cape Town, the local
tourist office has decided to emphasize the city's thriving sex
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing that foreign tourists may have been deterred by bombs on
the waterfront and gloomy crime reports, the Cape's official
boosters are letting it be known that those who seek illicit
thrills will find them in Cape Town. This follows an earlier
promotion of the city as a gay-friendly city, which indeed it is.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cape Town has long prided itself on a relatively free,
almost Californian image, none of this could have happened under
apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa's old state was not only racist, but also prudish.
Commercial sex, interracial sex, homosexuality and even Playboy
were all suppressed.
</P>
<P>
   The new South African constitution, by contrast, is perhaps the
most protective of gay rights in the world. In fact, the country
has become more permissive than most of its rather conservative
citizens, black or white, find comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Massage parlors and gay bars appeared towards the end of
apartheid, but they have grown more numerous and blatant since
1994, when the African National Congress came to power.
</P>
<P>
   Most ANC members probably disapprove of prostitution; some frown
on homosexuality. But few think it worthwhile to police what
happens between consenting adults.
</P>
<P>
   The new permissiveness affects city-dwellers more than country
people, the rich more than the poor. But it is still a change.
</P>
<P>
   Under the old regime, policemen cruised parks and beaches
looking for homosexuals to entrap; 300 people a year were jailed
for sodomy. Now, same-sex couples openly hold hands in
Johannesburg's mall cafes, and the police are more likely to
protect gay pickup spots from muggers than to persecute those
cruising.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, the censors banned an Iris Murdoch novel with a
Picasso nude on the cover. Now, plays such as ``Shopping and
F------'' (EDITORS: EXPLETIVE REMOVED) enjoy full houses.
</P>
<P>
   The laws against interracial sex were particularly cruel and
stupid, though they had been repealed by the time the ANC took
over. On stage, performances of ``Othello'' were allowed, but only
with an all-white cast and audience, so the Moor left smudges on
Desdemona's cheek.
</P>
<P>
   The speed of change has left many South Africans confused.
Liberals applaud the new tolerance for homosexuals, which contrasts
starkly with the situation in many other African countries, where
they face long jail terms.
</P>
<P>
   But some worry that tolerance for commercial sex may be unwise
when AIDS threatens to kill a third of the population. The Cape
Town tourist office counters that it will direct punters only to
brothels that treat their employees well and encourage condom use.
</P>
<P>
   Not all attempts to cash in on South Africa's new permissiveness
succeed. Not long ago a farmer tried to organize a ``hooker hunt,''
in which punters were to pay to stalk naked prostitutes in the
bushveld, and shoot them with paint balls. This proved unappealing
to all but a tiny handful of oafs. So the ladies kept their shirts
on, while the farmer lost his. &QL;

<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ Sun, surf, seafood and sauvignon blanc are not,
it seems, enough. To entice visitors to Cape Town, the local
tourist office has decided to emphasize the city's thriving sex
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing that foreign tourists may have been deterred by bombs on
the waterfront and gloomy crime reports, the Cape's official
boosters are letting it be known that those who seek illicit
thrills will find them in Cape Town. This follows an earlier
promotion of the city as a gay-friendly city, which indeed it is.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cape Town has long prided itself on a relatively free,
almost Californian image, none of this could have happened under
apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa's old state was not only racist, but also prudish.
Commercial sex, interracial sex, homosexuality and even Playboy
were all suppressed.
</P>
<P>
   The new South African constitution, by contrast, is perhaps the
most protective of gay rights in the world. In fact, the country
has become more permissive than most of its rather conservative
citizens, black or white, find comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Massage parlors and gay bars appeared towards the end of
apartheid, but they have grown more numerous and blatant since
1994, when the African National Congress came to power.
</P>
<P>
   Most ANC members probably disapprove of prostitution; some frown
on homosexuality. But few think it worthwhile to police what
happens between consenting adults.
</P>
<P>
   The new permissiveness affects city-dwellers more than country
people, the rich more than the poor. But it is still a change.
</P>
<P>
   Under the old regime, policemen cruised parks and beaches
looking for homosexuals to entrap; 300 people a year were jailed
for sodomy. Now, same-sex couples openly hold hands in
Johannesburg's mall cafes, and the police are more likely to
protect gay pickup spots from muggers than to persecute those
cruising.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, the censors banned an Iris Murdoch novel with a
Picasso nude on the cover. Now, plays such as ``Shopping and
F------'' (EDITORS: EXPLETIVE REMOVED) enjoy full houses.
</P>
<P>
   The laws against interracial sex were particularly cruel and
stupid, though they had been repealed by the time the ANC took
over. On stage, performances of ``Othello'' were allowed, but only
with an all-white cast and audience, so the Moor left smudges on
Desdemona's cheek.

   BALTIMORE, MD. _ Two months ago, it would have seemed nonsense.
A 36-year-old white lawyer who plays electric guitar in an Irish
band, and is almost unknown to most local people, will become the
next mayor of 65 percent-black Baltimore?
</P>
<P>
   Farfetched though it sounds, it is likely to happen. Having
handily won the Democratic nomination in the primary election on
Sept. 14, and with nine in ten Baltimore voters registered as
Democrats, Martin O'Malley will almost certainly be elected mayor
on Nov. 2.
</P>
<P>
   He has the endorsement of some key black leaders. His proposals
for cutting down crime in a city riddled with it are clearly
popular. And he has so far been unspattered by the mud thrown up in
the politics of a city that embodies the worst of urban America.
</P>
<P>
   Can O'Malley save Baltimore?
</P>
<P>
   ``Charm City,'' 35 miles north of Washington, sometimes seems
like one huge crack-cocaine and heroin market; city officials think
that as many as an eighth of its people are addicts.
</P>
<P>
   It has the country's highest venereal-disease rate and its
fourth-highest murder rate, three times that of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   It is also desperately short of money. Each month about 1,000 of
the city's population of 630,000 understandably depart to live in
the suburbs, draining its tax base and causing a projected $153
million budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Until about 30 years ago Baltimore had a strong blue-collar
economy based on a busy port, bustling factories and the fruits of
the vast Chesapeake Bay. No longer.
</P>
<P>
   David Bositis, a political analyst in nearby Washington, thinks
no right-minded person would want to be mayor of such a city.
``Shouldn't we have them take sanity tests?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   There was an unmistakable smile of relief on the face of the
outgoing mayor, Kurt Schmoke, when he announced that he did not
propose to run for another term in office.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, no fewer than 27 people, 17 of them Democrats,
said they wanted the job. But then it turned out that several had
criminal records, three had filed for bankruptcy, and one had
barely a primary-school education.
</P>
<P>
   An attempt was made to draw in some more impressive candidates,
including the president of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, Kweisi Mfume, who used to represent
central Baltimore in Congress; but none took the bait.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually three front-runners emerged, two black and one white.
One of the blacks, Lawrence A. Bell III, was the youngish president
of the city council and seemed a good prospect. But his campaign
was bumbling, and local journalists accused him of being sloppy
with money; he soon faded.
</P>
<P>
   The other main black contender, Carl Stokes, was a former member
of the school board and offered himself as ``the education
candidate.'' However, it emerged that he had not in fact graduated
from the local university he claimed as his alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   He apologized, and won some useful support, but by then it was
too late.
</P>
<P>
   Enter O'Malley, a fresh-faced lawyer who sauntered into the race
barely three weeks before the filing deadline. O'Malley had been a
vigorous member of the city council, yet few people knew him
outside his constituency in northeast Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   At first, he was dismissed as a white yuppie imported from the
Washington suburbs. But he gained momentum as his opponents
stumbled and as his promise to reform Baltimore caught the voters'
attention.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would immediately clean up the busiest drug markets,
and come down hard on petty criminals. He pointed to his work on
the council, where he had attacked police and housing officials for
corruption and pushed for stiffer punishment of criminals.
</P>
<P>
   He admitted that the city's middle-class northern neighborhoods
got better police protection than its poorer parts, but vowed to
change all that. It was music to the ears of people long accustomed
to hearing gun shots close to their doors.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in a racially divided city like Baltimore, even that
might not have been enough. But then O'Malley won the unprecedented
public support of some of the city's top black leaders.
</P>
<P>
   They were called ``race-traitors'' by an angry minority, but the
quiet majority were more interested in sorting out the city than in
voting for someone who looked like them.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Stokes and Bell won 25 percent and 17 percent of the
primary vote, no match for O'Malley's 53 percent. It was one of the
biggest political surprises in the city's history.
</P>
<P>
   Now O'Malley, assuming he wins election in November, faces an
even longer shot: cleaning up Baltimore. &QL;

 By TODD G. BUCHHOLZ  
 c.1999 Worth Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mighty China, which stood tall as capitalist neighbors from
Thailand to South Korea collapsed in 1997, is now struggling.
</P>
<P>
   The economy has skidded, prices are dropping, and foreign
lenders are demanding tougher terms from Chinese borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   So many forces are squeezing China simultaneously that it's
difficult to discuss the crisis systemically. But the big picture
is essentially this: The Communist Party, which celebrates 50 years
in power on Oct. 1, can't keep its stranglehold for another 50 _
and maybe not even for another 10.
</P>
<P>
   Capitalist ideas and aspirations of thriving in a global market
economy are the Western seeds taking root in Chinese soil, and
their bloom will lead to Communism's collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, fax machines, and untappable digital transmissions
have liberated Chinese entrepreneurs. And the healthy economy that
the Communist Party desperately needs cannot be had without further
freedom from state control and regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The Party may be striving to stifle the Internet's impact, but
its efforts will ultimately not succeed. Not in a country that
manufactures computers for Dell Computer and that launched its
first initial public offering for a Web site on the Nasdaq last
July (China.com).
</P>
<P>
   Because the Party seems nervous, Beijing's authority is being
challenged both at home and overseas. Thousands of citizens
belonging to a sect, Falun Gong, that stresses heavy-breathing
exercises have taken to the streets, daring arrest and brutal
imprisonment; they have been urged on over the Internet by the
sect's founder, an immigrant who lives in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the president of Taiwan verbally slapped China when he
insisted that Taiwan is a separate country. And earlier, in the
spring, U.S. President Bill Clinton contributed to Beijing's
turmoil by retracting a deal for China's entry into the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   This has cost economic czar Zhu Rongji a great deal of
credibility; increasingly he is the scapegoat for China's slow
economy, where prices are falling and the vaunted trade surplus
dropped by 64 percent during the first half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders within the Chinese government are sniping at one
another, most prominently Zhu and former prime minister Li Peng.
</P>
<P>
   Creditors sniff danger. Standard &AMP; Poor's recently cut China's
bond rating from BBB+ to just BBB. The loss of that plus sign will
force China to pay an extra quarter-point when it borrows from
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   The budget deficit will climb by about 50 percent in 1999, too,
as Beijing pumps up the money supply and increases spending on
infrastructure projects to combat a slowing economy. And China is
lagging while the rest of Asia is recovering nicely this year.
</P>
<P>
   Exporters from countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia, which
devalued their currencies in 1997, are stealing market share from
Chinese exporters, which are hampered by a strong currency, the
yuan.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the Shanghai stock exchange has been bleeding this
year. The shares that foreigners can own slumped by 28 percent
during the first three weeks of July alone.
</P>
<P>
   So why doesn't China devalue the yuan to speed up exports and
wipe out the uncertainty that is scaring investors away?
</P>
<P>
   China resists for the following reasons: First, a devaluation
might spiral out of control. Second, the G-7 might respond by
barring China from the WTO. Third _ and most important _ Beijing's
pride would suffer, especially given the 50th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese pride wouldn't be the only victim: A plunging yuan would
spook investors and rock China's recovering neighbors, robbing them
of this year's strong equity gains. &QL;

<P>
   Mighty China, which stood tall as capitalist neighbors from
Thailand to South Korea collapsed in 1997, is now struggling.
</P>
<P>
   The economy has skidded, prices are dropping, and foreign
lenders are demanding tougher terms from Chinese borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   So many forces are squeezing China simultaneously that it's
difficult to discuss the crisis systemically. But the big picture
is essentially this: The Communist Party, which celebrates 50 years
in power on Oct. 1, can't keep its stranglehold for another 50 _
and maybe not even for another 10.
</P>
<P>
   Capitalist ideas and aspirations of thriving in a global market
economy are the Western seeds taking root in Chinese soil, and
their bloom will lead to Communism's collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, fax machines, and untappable digital transmissions
have liberated Chinese entrepreneurs. And the healthy economy that
the Communist Party desperately needs cannot be had without further
freedom from state control and regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The Party may be striving to stifle the Internet's impact, but
its efforts will ultimately not succeed. Not in a country that
manufactures computers for Dell Computer and that launched its
first initial public offering for a Web site on the Nasdaq last
July (China.com).
</P>
<P>
   Because the Party seems nervous, Beijing's authority is being
challenged both at home and overseas. Thousands of citizens
belonging to a sect, Falun Gong, that stresses heavy-breathing
exercises have taken to the streets, daring arrest and brutal
imprisonment; they have been urged on over the Internet by the
sect's founder, an immigrant who lives in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the president of Taiwan verbally slapped China when he
insisted that Taiwan is a separate country. And earlier, in the
spring, U.S. President Bill Clinton contributed to Beijing's
turmoil by retracting a deal for China's entry into the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   This has cost economic czar Zhu Rongji a great deal of
credibility; increasingly he is the scapegoat for China's slow
economy, where prices are falling and the vaunted trade surplus
dropped by 64 percent during the first half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders within the Chinese government are sniping at one
another, most prominently Zhu and former prime minister Li Peng.
</P>
<P>
   Creditors sniff danger. Standard &AMP; Poor's recently cut China's
bond rating from BBB+ to just BBB. The loss of that plus sign will
force China to pay an extra quarter-point when it borrows from
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   The budget deficit will climb by about 50 percent in 1999, too,
as Beijing pumps up the money supply and increases spending on
infrastructure projects to combat a slowing economy. And China is
lagging while the rest of Asia is recovering nicely this year.
</P>
<P>
   Exporters from countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia, which
devalued their currencies in 1997, are stealing market share from
Chinese exporters, which are hampered by a strong currency, the
yuan.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the Shanghai stock exchange has been bleeding this
year. The shares that foreigners can own slumped by 28 percent
during the first three weeks of July alone.
</P>
<P>
   So why doesn't China devalue the yuan to speed up exports and
wipe out the uncertainty that is scaring investors away?
</P>
<P>
   China resists for the following reasons: First, a devaluation
might spiral out of control. Second, the G-7 might respond by
barring China from the WTO. Third _ and most important _ Beijing's
pride would suffer, especially given the 50th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese pride wouldn't be the only victim: A plunging yuan would
spook investors and rock China's recovering neighbors, robbing them
of this year's strong equity gains. &QL;

GARTH BROOKS' ROCK ALTER EGO AIN'T A PRETTY SIGHT ... OR SOUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So Garth Brooks assumes the fictitious persona of Chris Gaines,
an Australian-born pop singer who hit it big in the mid-'80s and
was seriously hurt in a car wreck in 1992, which led to four years
of recuperation. Gaines ``emerged'' in 1996 and was dubbed ``the
new Prince'' upon the release of his CD ``Triangle.'' And now, in
1999, he's releasing a greatest-hits CD.
</P>
<P>
   He faces us now with long hair flopping into his dark-blue,
piercing eyes _ Trent Reznor's big brother, bloodied but not bowed.
And according to the cover, the CD hitting stores this week is a
``pre-soundtrack'' to a movie called ``The Lamb'' _ which,
according to industry sources, has not begun filming yet.
</P>
<P>
   Got all that? Good. ``Garth Brooks In ... The Life of Chris
Gaines'' is that greatest-hits collection: 13 tunes by a man who
never lived, taken from CDs that never existed.
</P>
<P>
   And man, is it lame. Brooks has always name-dropped the most
mainstream rock acts as his favorites: Styx, Billy Joel, the
Beatles. His appropriation of pop is, thus, quite vanilla _ there's
nothing singular about his foray into rock, no compelling voice.
</P>
<P>
   This CD arrives with liner notes from Gaines, photos of old
records (two of them amazingly sexist), and a shot of his old band,
Crush, looking a lot like a trio version of Loverboy _
eeeeewwwwwww. Most worrisome, though, is a photo of Garth/Chris in
a black-and-white leotard.
</P>
<P>
   Scary. Very scary.
</P>
<P>
   And so is the music. You know how you listen to someone and they
remind you of someone else and you can't think who that someone
else is? It took me a few minutes, but I figured out who
Garth-as-Chris sounds like: Kenny Loggins and Richard Marx.
</P>
<P>
   Lightly soulful white-bread vocals. Softer-than-soft rock. Wimpy
guitar solos. Yep, it's all here. Unfortunately. Brooks makes a big
bid at pop/rock stardom, and he emulates two incredibly mediocre
guys who were never memorable solo artists in their own right? What
was he thinking?
</P>
<P>
   And to give Loggins and Marx credit, they've both done songs _
such as Marx's ``Don't Mean Nothing'' _ that are better than
anything here. Then again, so has Loverboy _ I'd trade ``Hot Girls
in Love'' for any cut here.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Loggins/Marx references aren't always there.
There are some equally limp funk-rock touches, as on ``Snow in
July,'' and a smooth Babyface-ish R&AMP;B ballad, ``Lost in You.'' None
of them holds a candle to 99.5 percent of Prince's output. And then
there's ``Main Street'' (breathe a sigh of relief, it is not the
Bob Seger tune), which sounds like something John Mellencamp wisely
decided against releasing.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the worst moment of the CD is ``Right Now,'' which
mixes Gaines' alternating rap _ sample lyrics: ``Maybe it's the
drugs/Maybe it's the parents/Maybe it's the gangs with the colors
that we're wearin' '' _ with the chorus to the Youngbloods' ``Get
Together'' _ you know, the ``smile on your brother'' tune. This is
perhaps the worst attempt at rap I've ever heard, bar none, and a
horrible stab at social consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   These songs seem to evaporate as they're being listened to:
There's nothing compelling or particularly memorable about any of
them _ and at several points, such as ``Right Now,'' the urge to
laugh becomes nearly overpowering.
</P>
<P>
   As a personal reinvention, this CD is mildly interesting at
best, if you don't ask too many questions _ such as why put the CD
out now, so far in advance of the movie, and why Brooks' '80s look
(and those CD covers) go so far to try to emulate '80s hair-metal
bands, without any of those acts' sometimes successful merging of
pop and glam-derived rock.
</P>
<P>
   If I want to hear Loverboy _ or Kenny Loggins, or the Beatles,
or Prince _ I can hear them. They're as close as my CD collection,
or the local store. Why anyone would want to hear Garth Brooks do a
bad approximation of them, and others, is beyond me.

SOUTHWEST AIRLINES' ZANY CEO IS NO JOKE TO HIS RIVALS  
 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Business Editors...RESENDING from 9-23)   (This lively 1,000-word ``separate buy'' profile of Southwest
Airlines' eccentric CEO Herb Kelleher _ is from the September issue
of ``WORTH'' magazine. To publish this article, it must be

<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe it's because he occasionally dresses like Elvis to deliver
presentations or because he calls his leadership style ``management
by fooling around.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it's because he once told top airline executives that
his proudest achievement was that he'd ``never had a really serious
venereal disease.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, it is impossible to write a reverential story about
the man who began his 1997 testimony before the National Civil
Aviation Review Commission thusly: ``My name is Herb Kelleher.
Because I am unable to perform competently any meaningful function
at Southwest, our 25,000 employees let me be CEO.''
</P>
<P>
   Reminded of these exploits, the 68-year-old Kelleher _ ``Herb''
to his employees _ rocks back in mid-drag on his omnipresent
cigarette and fills the conference room of Southwest Airlines'
Dallas headquarters with loud, wheezing laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Then he turns suddenly earnest: ``I guess I've tried to be a
little bit iconoclastic, striving to get people to think outside
the box.''
</P>
<P>
   A ``little'' bit? This from the man whose flight attendants have
been known to emerge from overhead bins to rap the pre-flight
safety instructions? From the man who won a fare war against
Braniff by offering fliers a fifth of Chivas Regal?
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher smiles and says, ``I've always said that if it's
conventional, it's not wisdom, and if it's wisdom, it's not
conventional.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-three years ago, then-lawyer Kelleher and pilot Rollin
King huddled in a Texas bar to invent low-fare airline service.
Scribbling on a cocktail napkin, King proposed a regional carrier
that would shuttle passengers between Dallas, Houston, and San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   If it could keep costs low enough, King argued, an airline could
create a new class of fliers out of folks who normally traveled
between those cities by car, train, or bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're crazy,'' Kelleher responded. ``Let's do it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the three decades since, Southwest has emerged as the most
consistently profitable venture in the history of American
commercial aviation: in the black every year since 1973, with
record profits each year since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Which suggests there's nothing funny about Kelleher's management
credo _ that a laid-back, jargon-free, slightly loony environment
inside a company breeds apostolic fervor outside it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago,'' he says, ``the business schools would ask,
`Which comes first: employees, customers, or shareholders?' It was
regarded as a conundrum; any answer would get you in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I said the employees come first, because if they're
happy and satisfied and ennobled by what they're doing, they treat
your customers better, and then the customers come back, and that's
good for your shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Southwest workers seem preternaturally happy and ennobled, and
not just because their employer was one of the first airlines to
offer profit participation and stock ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest's low annual employee-turnover rate is legendary in
the industry, and the company's one work stoppage lasted less than
a day.
</P>
<P>
   Customers are happy, too. Between 1992 and 1996, Southwest led
the industry in three key service categories: best on-time
performance, fewest flier complaints, and best baggage handling.
And Southwest consistently ranks near the top of the airline
quality ratings.
</P>
<P>
   As for shareholders, anyone who invested $1,000 in Southwest
stock (NYSE:LUV) 25 years ago is a millionaire today.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent share price of $32, Southwest stock trades at 24.7
times last year's earnings, almost double the industry norm of 13.5
The company's 1998 net income of $433 million marked a 36.4 percent
gain over 1997. First-quarter profits in 1999 beat 1998's first
quarter by 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Operationally, Southwest has hardly changed since it first took
to the air in 1971. Its fleet consists only of Boeing 737s, which
keeps service costs down and achieves economies of scale in
purchases and repairs.
</P>
<P>
   There's only token meal service; seating is first-come,
first-served; and the planes, says Kelleher, fly into ``overpriced,
underserved markets not plagued by slot controls, congestion, and
air-traffic delays.''
</P>
<P>
   That means Baltimore/Washington International, not Washington
National; Providence, not Boston. Following this regimen, Southwest
last year carried 52.6 million passengers to 52 cities, mostly in
the South and the West.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Southwest has added three cities to its route map,
but the industry is buzzing about just one of them. That city is
New York, or at least an airfield as close as Southwest's strategy
allows: MacArthur Airport, 50 miles east on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   The big question about Kelleher's foray into Gotham is whether
it will trigger the notorious ``Southwest Effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Short-haul fares out of D.C. dropped 35 percent after Southwest
set up in BWI; one-way fares to Boston sagged from about $200 to
about $120. But New York has historically resisted rate-cutting
efforts, and US Airways and Delta won't cede turf without a fight.
</P>
<P>
   The New York venture also raises the prospect of nonstop
coast-to-coast service. A Southwest Effect on the super-competitive
transcontinental routes could be devastating to larger airlines,
whose costs on longer flights are an estimated 30 to 35 percent
higher than Southwest's.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Kelleher denies any plans to fly nonstop coast
to coast. And yet there was that nonstop run from Baltimore to
Oakland last Thanksgiving, which Kelleher dismissed as a ``onetime
experiment.''
</P>
<P>
   And the airline has firm orders into Boeing for 105 new
737-700s, planes with cross-continental range.
</P>
<P>
   If Southwest does break nationwide, will Kelleher be around to
enjoy the furor? Not to be morbid, but Herb is nearing 70, was
recently diagnosed with cancer, and he's not exactly a poster boy
for clean living.
</P>
<P>
   He insists he's ``not going anywhere,'' but in any case, the
Southwest organization already bears his imprint.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the message that callers to Southwest's reservation
line hear when they're waiting on hold: ``If you have been holding
for more than 30 seconds, please press 8. It won't get your call
answered any faster, but it may make you feel better.'' &QL;

THE MAN WHO CALLS HIMSELF GARTH NOW CALLS HIMSELF GAINES?

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SHIRLEY JINKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's Chris Gaines, bad haircut and all, staring dolefully
from the cover of his retrospective CD, ``Garth Brooks In ... The
Life of Chris Gaines,'' hitting record stores this week. The hungry
and embittered look, pouting lip, smudged eyeliner all bespeak a
rough life.
</P>
<P>
   Only thing is, it's a life that's never been lived.
</P>
<P>
   Why would a wildly successful and lucky guy like Garth Brooks
want to quit being Garth Brooks for a while and instead be this
mercurial ``Chris Gaines?'' Doesn't the feds' Witness Protection
Program have the patent on creating identities?
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, why is this a surprise? He has been talking about
the film project for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad you get this,'' Brooks says indulgently in a phone
interview earlier this month. ``It's a character in a movie I was
hired by Paramount to do the music for. It's not a career move,
it's just a character.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie is ``The Lamb,'' and it won't be released until late
summer 2000. The script is being written by Jeb Stuart. ``He wrote
`The Fugitive,' which is basically what this is, with a female
lead,'' says Brooks, who has had the original idea ever since he
started his Red Strokes film production company in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Gaines may make appearances in controlled environments such as
TV guest spots and on his own TV special at 7 p.m. Wednesday, but
he'll never appear live.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we tour, it'll be as Garth. You know what's going to happen
if I tour as Chris Gaines,'' Brooks says. ``Somebody in the crowd
will stand up and yell `Come on, do ``Friends in Low Places''' and
it will all get started from there. But we might do the Youngbloods
thing (from the Gaines album) as an encore or something.''
</P>
<P>
   And there's the prospect of perhaps seeing Brooks hosting an
upcoming ``Saturday Night Live'' with Chris Gaines as the musical
guest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure one of the smart-(aleck) questions is gonna be,
`Which one is the act, Garth or Chris,' '' says Brooks, who often
pointedly refers to his stage self in the third person. (And, yes,
that was one of our first smart-(aleck) questions.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ONCE AND AGAIN: It's not the first time Brooks has taken on a
fictional identity. In January 1993, he and his band did some
small-club dates under an assumed name, at a time when he was
selling out large arenas several times over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were Yukon Jack back then and nobody said anything,'' he
says. ``We were on our way to (perform at) the Super Bowl. It would
be nice to do that again, but no.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Chris Gaines is being given unusual latitude. Brooks is
introducing him a full year before the movie comes out, in TV
specials and late-show appearances. The object is for us to get to
``know'' Chris, better than we knew Spinal Tap, as well as our kids
knew Ginger Spice. Gaines will be with us for at least a year,
until the movie comes out. Brooks calls it ``an education
process.'' He maintains that the music will stand on its own,
without the film. Two singles, ``Lost in You'' and ``It Don't
Matter to the Sun'' have been released to pop and country formats,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this thing is based on the music, it'll be a huge
success,'' he says. ``But if it's because it's Garth Brooks, then
it won't get very far.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks has other Red Strokes film projects on the table, too,
like the ongoing ``Revelations'' project, which he plans to
produce. He has been toying for several years with the idea for the
story of ``an average guy that ends up with the destiny of the
world in his hands.'' Then there is ``Samuel's Box,'' a political
movie.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks says it surprises and disturbs him that people treat him
as something of a snake-oil salesman with every new project and
expect defection from Nashville at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is that? It seems like they really expect me to, as soon
as they turn around, stab them in the back or something,'' he says.
``Every time we bring something out, you hear `He's turning his
back on country!' '' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DOING IT FOR MOM: Brooks, the real guy, has other non-Gaines
projects afoot. They include a Christmas album that will be tied
into a TV project, a duet album in the works with Trisha Yearwood,
and his work as producer on old bud Ty England's new Capitol album.
</P>
<P>
   Which is all pretty much puttering for a man who has sold more
than 60 million albums this decade and taken country music farther
than its council of elders ever dreamed possible.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his personal life, coupled with a self-imposed two-year
hiatus from touring, has left Brooks at a crossroads. His mother,
Colleen, died of cancer Aug. 6. A onetime country singer herself,
she recorded in the 1950s with meager success. She married and left
show business, then got to ride in limousines and live large when
her youngest child became famous. He has virtually taken control of
the label for which she had recorded, Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm also getting to a point where it (the prospect of touring)
scares me,'' he says. ``I'm getting older (37), my girls are
getting older. They're 7, 5 and 3, and this is the first time
they've all been in school together.''
</P>
<P>
   The question, then, is obvious: Does Garth Brooks still have
fire in the belly?
</P>

THE MAN WHO CALLS HIMSELF GARTH NOW CALLS HIMSELF GAINES?
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   There's Chris Gaines, bad haircut and all, staring dolefully
from the cover of his retrospective CD, Garth Brooks In ... The
Life of Chris Gaines,'' hitting record stores this week. The hungry
and embittered look, pouting lip, smudged eyeliner all bespeak a
rough life.
</P>
<P>
   Only thing is, it's a life that's never been lived. Why would a
wildly successful and lucky guy like Garth Brooks want to quit
being Garth Brooks for a while and instead be this mercurial
``Chris Gaines''?
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't the feds' Witness Protection Program have the patent on
creating identities? Better yet, why is this a surprise? He has
been talking about the film project for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad you get this,'' Brooks says indulgently in a phone
interview earlier this month. ``It's a character in a movie I was
hired by Paramount to do the music for. It's not a career move,
it's just a character.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie is ``The Lamb,'' and it won't be released until late
summer 2000. The script is being written by Jeb Stuart. He wrote
`The Fugitive,' which is basically what this is, with a female
lead,'' says Brooks, who has had the original idea ever since he
started his Red Strokes film production company in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Gaines may make appearances in controlled environments such as
TV guest spots and on his own TV special at 7 p.m. Wednesday, but
he'll never appear live.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we tour, it'll be as Garth. You know what's going to happen
if I tour as Chris Gaines,'' Brooks says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody in the crowd will stand up and yell `Come on, do
Friends in Low Places''' and it will all get started from there.
But we might do the Youngbloods thing (from the Gaines album) as an
encore or something.''
</P>
<P>
   And there's the prospect of perhaps seeing Brooks hosting an
upcoming ``Saturday Night Live'' with Chris Gaines as the musical
guest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure one of the smart-(aleck) questions is gonna be,
`Which one is the act, Garth or Chris,''' says Brooks, who often
pointedly refers to his stage self in the third person. (And, yes,
that was one of our first smart-(aleck) questions.)
</P>
<P>
   ONCE AND AGAIN: It's not the first time Brooks has taken on a
fictional identity. In January 1993, he and his band did some
small-club dates under an assumed name, at a time when he was
selling out large arenas several times over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were Yukon Jack back then and nobody said anything,'' he
says. ``We were on our way to (perform at) the Super Bowl. It would
be nice to do that again, but no.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Chris Gaines is being given unusual latitude. Brooks is
introducing him a full year before the movie comes out, in TV
specials and late-show appearances. The object is for us to get to
know Chris, better than we knew Spinal Tap, as well as our kids
knew Ginger Spice. Gaines will be with us for at least a year,
until the movie comes out. Brooks calls it an ``education
process.''
</P>
<P>
   He maintains that the music will stand on its own, without the
film. Two singles, ``Lost in You'' and ``It Don't Matter to the
Sun'' have been released to pop and country formats, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this thing is based on the music, it'll be a huge
success,'' he says. ``But if it's because it's Garth Brooks, then
it won't get very far.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks has other Red Strokes film projects on the table, too,
like the ongoing ``Revelations'' project, which he plans to
produce. He has been toying for several years with the idea for the
story of an ``average guy that ends up with the destiny of the
world in his hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is ``Samuel's Box,'' a political movie. Brooks says
it surprises and disturbs him that people treat him as something of
a snake-oil salesman with every new project and expect defection
from Nashville at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is that? It seems like they really expect me to, as soon
as they turn around, stab them in the back or something,'' he says.
``Every time we bring something out, you hear `He's turning his
back on country!''' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DOING IT FOR MOM: Brooks, the real guy, has other non-Gaines
projects afoot. They include a Christmas album that will be tied
into a TV project, a duet album in the works with Trisha Yearwood,
and his work as producer on old bud Ty England's new Capitol album.
</P>
<P>
   Which is all pretty much puttering for a man who has sold more
than 60 million albums this decade and taken country music farther
than its council of elders ever dreamed possible.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his personal life, coupled with a self-imposed two-year
hiatus from touring, has left Brooks at a crossroads. His mother,
Colleen, died of cancer Aug. 6. A onetime country singer herself,
she recorded in the 1950s with meager success. She married and left
show business, then got to ride in limousines and live large when
her youngest child became famous. He has virtually taken control of
the label for which she had recorded, Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm also getting to a point where it (the prospect of touring)
scares me,'' he says. ``I'm getting older (37), my girls are
getting older. They're 7, 5 and 3, and this is the first time
they've all been in school together.''
</P>
<P>
   The question, then, is obvious: Does Garth Brooks still have
fire in the belly?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was worried about this, when it was all happening,'' he says
in a dramatic whisper. ``Because the music, it was always about my
mom, more than it was for me. Now that she's gone, I don't know if
I have that fire, that motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   We'll see if Chris Gaines does.

HALF-HOUR `ALLY' TURNS UP THE NEUROSIS A NOTCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why has David E. Kelley bisected episodes of his hourlong Ally
McBeal to create the 30-minute show ``Ally?'' The answer is not
that a powerful producer does ``whatever he wants'' simply because
he can. It is instead that Kelley is a talented, shrewd competitor
whose self-exaltation prevents him from being less than perfect at
anything.
</P>
<P>
   When asked recently why he decided to pitch ``Ally,'' a
collection of previously aired scenes edited to have a beginning,
middle and end, Kelley gave the honest answer, ``Because it would
play better in syndication.'' Not that it's about money, of which
he and wife Michelle Pfeiffer have plenty.
</P>
<P>
   He's right about comedies being better sellers and therefore
revenue generators for the production companies that own them, the
local stations that run them and the producer who creates them _
Kelley is two of those three. But later in the conversation, Kelley
revealed that nothing irks him more than syndication types actually
saying that his ``Ally McBeal'' is less desirable than any
run-of-the-mill comedy. Not because the sitcoms are pleasingly
snappy and crack us up, but because half-hours play so much better
in rerunville, period.
</P>
<P>
   ``That rankled me,'' Kelley said. ``It just didn't sit well.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't sit well because Kelley is the consummate competitor,
a publicly gentle, accommodating soul privately driven to extremes.
His drive is not only to be creative in a business where that
quality is undervalued, but to be at the top of every measurable
aspect of the business. Whether it's the quantity of shows on
network television (five series with the Kelley imprint are on this
season) or the quality, which means having his series ``Ally
McBeal'' and ``The Practice'' capture best-series Emmys in their
respective comedy and drama categories in the same year, Kelley
wants it all.
</P>
<P>
   So ``Ally'' is yet another top-of-the-mountain achievement that
will leave us bowing to his royalness.
</P>
<P>
   In understanding the potential here, you must consider that
rabid fans of this witty dramedy will find a new series designed to
provide any Calista Flockhart fix they might need in addition to
the regular series airing Monday nights. As for anti-Allys, they'd
better run and hide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ally'' is Flockhart's spastic character on overdrive. Kelley
has cut out and condensed a story line (he usually has a main story
and ``B'' and ``C'' plot lines), which he follows to completion.
</P>
<P>
   He promises that new footage or outtakes that didn't make the
cut the first time will be added to enhance story lines or give
them common-sense context. What we'll get is an even more
pronounced Ally in all her scatterbrained, desk-tripping,
self-analyzing glory, which is sometimes hard to take, even when
viewers are given a rest by the shenanigans of Fish (Greg
Germann),) Elaine (Jane Krakowski) and the Biscuit (Peter
MacNicol). But this works, too, particularly if you saw subplots as
a nuisance anyhow.
</P>
<P>
   Visually, ``Ally'' moves along quickly, thanks largely to the
editing, and a speed-up device Kelley uses as if he's playing
around with the fast-forward button on a VCR. It's used when the
show is returning from commercial breaks and for scene changes, and
it's no more distracting than those dream sequences that have been
an ``Ally McBeal'' signature.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley says he's doing all the editing, which shouldn't surprise
us, since he is known for his reluctance to delegate writing
chores. (Kelley's answer to that is that complex characters are
difficult to write for.) But even at a half-hour, he has managed to
vary the pace of scenes, allowing dialogue to dictate mood and
motive. Also, the early word that the series would be comedic Ally
with none of those thorny moral dilemmas was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Ally in practically every scene over a 22-minute span
(subtracting time for commercials) offers not a different
perspective so much as a stronger one about the character's sanity.
Is, for instance, Elaine right in the upcoming episode ``100
Tears'' that Ally is ``two-thirds away from a Rice Krispy. She's
already snapped and crackling, and she's close to the final pop.''
</P>
<P>
   She was telling this to the State Bar Review Board after Ally
tripped a shopper at the supermarket and practically slugged a guy
after he accidentally bumped into her on a crowded sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think I'm nuts?'' Ally asks Whipper (Dyan Cannon), the
judge who has her own issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' she answers. ``But I'm not sure you have two feet on the
ground, either.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the surprises at this year's Emmys was that ``Ally
McBeal'' won, and that it shouldn't have, considering that last
season its quirkiness turned to wackiness, which turned to
silliness.
</P>
<P>
   I have to admit to not rushing home on Monday nights to catch
it, even to forgetting that it was on. But many of the people who
said it had fallen and shouldn't get up were those who weren't
watching it on a regular basis anymore, and who figured, wrongly,
that no one else was, either.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley's ego aside, watching ``Ally'' did a couple things. It
showed me what a gloriously prickly, multidimensional character the
producer has given us, and that all the talk that ``Ally McBeal''
no longer matters is premature.
</P>
<P>
   Laugh all you want when Ally falls into a toilet or dives for
that Dancing Baby. I'll watch to see the upcoming episode ``The
Promise,'' when the fiancee of the overweight attorney questions
her romantic future because of her own obesity, saying that ``if
you hold out for everything, sometimes you end up with nothing.''
Or ``Fools Night Out,'' in which Ally confronts her client, a
minister trying to get his scorned lover to stop putting their
business in her gospel lyrics, about how he could fall ``out'' of
love.
</P>
<P>
   Ally brings into full view a character who could cross the line
into neurosis at any moment. I don't call that weak. I call it
being strong, alive and unafraid of rolling in the mud with your
pain.

   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ Parents of 22,400 Texas A&AMP;M University
students got sobering letters from administrators last week,
warning them of an epidemic of underage drinking on campus _
especially among wide-eyed freshmen enjoying their first taste of
freedom away from home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are asking you to partner with us in addressing the
increasing use and abuse of alcohol and other drugs by college
students,'' said the letter from student life director Brent G.
Paterson, sent to the parents of all Aggie students under age 21.
</P>
<P>
   If they're lucky, the parents won't be getting a second letter
that goes something like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``Recently, I received information your son/daughter was found
in violation of a Texas A&AMP;M University Student Rule regarding
inappropriate possession and-or use of alcohol.''
</P>
<P>
   Research studies, campus arrest reports and other indicators
suggest that chances are good that any given Aggie has abused or
illegally used alcohol. One university survey found that 73 percent
of males and 71 percent of females at A&AMP;M use alcohol, and nearly
half admitted going on a drinking binge within the past two weeks.
One in three had missed class because of a hangover, and 40 percent
confessed to driving under the influence.
</P>
<P>
   Drinking-related consequences and dangers aren't unique to A&AMP;M,
but this year's two alcohol-related deaths of Aggie students drove
home the seriousness of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent letter to parents, A&AMP;M President Ray Bowen said he
wants the university to be ``free of alcohol abuse and its effects
in the classroom, in student residence communities on and off
campus, in our time-honored traditions and in those activities that
are the social fabric of our campus.''
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M is the first public university in Texas to opt for parental
notification of liquor and drug violations on campus. The notice
says that ``although we understand students are adults and need to
assume responsibility for their actions, we know that parents still
play a very important role in their development.''
</P>
<P>
   The message urges parents to talk to their kids about
inappropriate drinking behavior, which could jeopardize ``their
health, their academic performance, their relationships with others
and their future.'' It also advises parents about available
counseling, treatment, assessment and education programs, including
``Alcohol 101'' lectures.
</P>
<P>
   Research has shown that parents retain the most influence over
their children, even in college, when it comes to health-related
behaviors, said Kristin S. Harper, associate director of the
Department of Student Life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other thing we know from talking to parents is they ...
often didn't find out until a student was removed from school or
their residence hall, and then it was too late,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   University of Texas officials said they notify parents of rules
violations only if a student asks them to do so. They have no
immediate plans to adopt a policy like A&AMP;M's.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Christian University in Fort Worth is the only other
campus in the state that has joined the nationwide initiative to
make parents of minors aware of their infractions. Last year,
Congress changed the privacy protection law forcollege students
under age 21 to allow parental notification of disciplinary
violations.
</P>
<P>
   A survey in April of the 64 public and private colleges
participating in the National Core Drug and Alcohol Survey
indicates that at least 10 public universities, including A&AMP;M,
planned to begin parental notification this fall. Michigan State,
Kentucky and Virginia Tech also joined the trend.
</P>
<P>
   At least 15 private colleges, including TCU, Drake and
Georgetown universities, have adopted similar policies, although
notification isn't always automatic. Some colleges do it only after
multiple offenses or after case-by-case consideration.
</P>
<P>
   But at A&AMP;M, parents will be notified upon an underage drinker's
first offense _ once the allegation runs through the university's
nonjudicial disciplinary process and results in a guilty finding.
The first such letters will be mailed this week, based on
violations that have occurred since classes resumed a few weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you drink, you're going to have Mommy and Daddy, in
addition to other people, coming down on you,'' warned Bob Wiatt,
director of A&AMP;M security and university police.
</P>
<P>
   He applauded the administration's decision to target the drunken
``debauchery'' that accompanies some Aggie events and traditions,
especially the bonfire and pep rally preceding the annual football
game with Texas. This year, the bonfire will be on Thanksgiving
night.
</P>
<P>
   Of equal concern, Wiatt said, is the everyday drinking in
dormitories and off-campus bars, aided by computer-generated, bogus
identification cards used by those under the legal drinking age of
21.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know from high school this is a sin,'' Wiatt said. ``What
you have is a bunch of youngsters, who, for the most part, have
been protected by Mommy and Daddy, and they are now free _ free at
last. They are on their own at a university where they are
unfettered.''
</P>
<P>
   Eager to experiment and to fit in with others, under-age
students have little trouble obtaining booze, either through older
friends or with fake ID cards, according to university officials.
</P>
<P>
   While many, if not most, violations go unreported and ignored,
in each of the last four years campus police have arrested more
than 200 students for illegal possession of alcohol, public
intoxication and driving while intoxicated. That tally doesn't
include arrests made by Brazos County sheriff's deputies or police
in College Station, Bryan and other nearby jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge problem. People have died,'' said the campus
security director.
</P>
<P>
   In January, an intoxicated student fell to his death while
sliding down a bannister in a campus parking garage.
</P>
<P>
   Wiatt said the young man's parents couldn't believe their son
would abuse alcohol, so he presented them with the student's fake
ID to help them comprehend the reality.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a student celebrating on the eve of his 21st
birthday died of alcohol poisoning at his off-campus residence.
</P>
<P>
   UT has had two alcohol-related deaths in recent years. Last
year, a 23-year-old student died of alcohol poisoning following a
fraternity hazing ritual. In 1995, an intoxicated 19-year-old
student drowned in the Colorado River in another hazing-related
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   While parents may be unaware of their children's drinking, A&AMP;M
students likewise have been caught unaware by the new notification
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the first-year students who I have talked to were,
quite honestly, surprised that parents hadn't been notified
before,'' said Lorna Breault, who leads the alcohol education
program tailored for Aggie freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time, their parents know'' about their drinking,
she said, adding that ``parents still do have a great deal of
influence. If parents can set standards ... that will help us.''
</P>
<P>
   Police aren't the only officials trying to arrest the problem.
Professors occasionally report drunken students in class, and
residence hall advisers have turned in students found drunk in
their dorm rooms. In training sessions, university personnel are
urged to no longer ignore drinking offenses.
</P>
<P>
   This fiscal year, A&AMP;M will spend almost $225,000 for alcohol and
drug education programs, including an upcoming campaign to
discourage drinking before, during and after the annual bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to notify parents followed the recommendation of a
task force set up in 1997 to examine an ``environment for alcoholic
abuse'' on campus. Students, faculty, staff, community members and
representatives of the Federation of Aggie Mothers Clubs
participated in the dialogue, said Harper, who chaired the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Notifying the families is one way we address this issue,'' she
said, ``but it's part of a very big picture of our concern about
what we think is an appropriate environment here at A&AMP;M.''

IT'S NOT TOO LATE FOR A MILLENNIUM TREAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   The hype isn't working.
</P>
<P>
   With the millennium a few weeks away, travel agents and tourism
officials say there are still plenty of openings for hotels and
cruises.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, there was a flurry of demand for vacation
packages as the excitement mounted. But then prices started to
climb, travel agents say.
</P>
<P>
   ``They priced themselves right out of the market,'' said Gwynne
Balson, president of All Destinations travel agency outside Albany,
N.Y. ``I've had so many customers throw up their hands and say,
`Forget it. I'll just stay home.'''
</P>
<P>
   This New Year's Eve may be more ``home alone,'' then party
central.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the anticipated boom, many places did not roll out
much advertising. Now, many wish they had.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry thought there would be a huge demand,'' said
David Wood, co-owner of Wood Travel in Albany, ``but they scared
everyone away.''
</P>
<P>
   Circus Circus, the Las Vegas casino, is charging $399 a night
with a three-night minimum at its hotel. Rates at the hotel for the
following week are as low as $49 a night with no minimum stay. They
have vacancies for New Year's.
</P>
<P>
   Most hotels and real estate agencies are requiring some sort of
minimum stay. However, as New Year's Eve inches closer, some are
thinking of dropping the minimum.
</P>
<P>
   Disney required a refundable deposit to get to be in a lottery
for a spot on a cruise _ even before they announced a price, Wood
said. The company reported that thousands of people made a deposit
for a 1,000-person millennium cruise.
</P>
<P>
   When the price finally was announced _ $3,000 for a four-day
Caribbean cruise that would normally be about $700 _ almost
everyone asked for their deposit back. Now, Disney is struggling to
fill spots on the ship.
</P>
<P>
   Balson said that several companies already have begun to bring
down their prices and hotels and other in the industry will get a
better grip on reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be profitable, no doubt,'' said Grant Flowers,
associate editor of Travel Weekly, a U.S. Trade Publication.
``Customers just do not want to be gouged.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT MAUNA KEA, Hawaii _ On the final ascent up this volcanic
mountain, the gleaming white housing of Japan's new national
telescope, which looks vaguely futuristic with its cylindrical
shape, immediately sets it apart from the more traditional domes
that sprout nearby in the cold, thin air.
</P>
<P>
   But it is only upon closer inspection of the device, named the
Subaru, that one begins to see that the design of the telescope
responsible for Japan's great leap forward in deep-space
observation commences with what would seem to be a decided step
backward: the use of a single huge piece of glass as its primary
mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Since the completion of the revolutionary 200-inch telescope on
Palomar Mountain in 1948, telescope designers have been confronted
with a seemingly intractable problem preventing the design of ever
larger light-gathering mirrors: the gradual distorting effects of
gravity on massive pieces of suspended glass.
</P>
<P>
   Telescope designers in recent years have resorted to a variety
of tricks to overcome this problem. For example, the primary
mirrors in Subaru's closest neighbors on the mountain, the twin
400-inch Keck telescopes, the two largest in the world, are each
made up of many joined segments with a common focus.
</P>
<P>
   Several other new telescopes have featured very thin ``floppy''
mirrors, combined with computer-controlled supports that can
constantly adjust the shape of the mirror to compensate for
gravity's sag and even atmospheric blur.
</P>
<P>
   Another strategy, being used by the European Southern
Observatory for its array of four 320-inch telescopes at La Serena
in Chile, is to combine the light from separate telescopes to
obtain the resolving power of a vastly larger lens. The Kecks are
designed to be so linked eventually.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has long suffered the image of being a nation of
scientific followers. In astronomy, for example, the country had
long been limited to the use of an 80-inch device built decades
ago. But when it came to designing a new telescope, the country's
small astronomy establishment shed the follower image and wagered
boldly that the magic of the single-mirror approach _ something of
a classical ideal among telescope builders _ was far from played
out. The result was the Subaru. (The name does not indicate a
connection to the car company; instead, it is the Japanese name for
the constellation Pleiades.)
</P>
<P>
   In pulling off its creation, Japan has applied the nation's
exquisite skills in engineering, design, construction and
miniaturization in ways that experts say will strongly influence
the future course of building very large telescopes.
</P>
<P>
   Among the features that will be looked at most carefully are its
flexible, relatively thin, seven-inch-thick mirror and an enclosure
that is of a piece with the telescope itself and rotates to change
views of the sky. Scientists say that the enclosure design, once
criticized for its cost, has already proven its superiority in the
critical areas of temperature and wind-flow control.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is the system of servo-controlled active optics,
which uses 264 motors to adjust the mirror, to correct for minute
distortions.
</P>
<P>
   All of this cost Japan $400 million at current exchange rates,
or several times the price of the first Keck telescope. But
astronomers say that Japanese telescope builders, unlike those in
the United States and Europe, had to build virtually everything
from scratch, something that must be taken into consideration in
evaluating the price.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within a couple of years, a conventional wisdom will form as
to which approach to big telescope construction is most
advantageous and most economical,'' said Dr. Robert McLaren,
interim director of the University of Hawaii's Institute for
Astronomy. ``Right now, most people expect that the single-lens
approach will prove superior.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though it is not yet equipped with the devices that
astronomers will need to take full advantage of its powers, the
Subaru telescope has already exceeded many of its designers'
expectations. It has, for example, already broken the resolution
record for ground-based telescopes, with the ability to see angular
details as small as 0.196 arc seconds, about five times better than
conventional telescopes.
</P>
<P>
   When a new adaptive optics system is installed, allowing for
correction of atmospheric distortions, the resolution is expected
to increase to 0.06 arc seconds. Such sharpness, scientists say, is
the equivalent of being able to see a baseball clearly from 180
miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The next generation of space-based telescopes are expected to
take decisive advantage of the dark vacuum of space to offer
resolution superior to any Earth-bound telescope. For now, though,
Subaru's astronomers readily offer side-by-side comparisons of
their device's images with those taken by the Hubble Space
Telescope, and believe many of their images are clearly better.
</P>
<P>
   The astronomers who will operate Subaru say the telescope's
ultra-high resolution, its superb light-gathering capacity and its
so-called prime-focus view, which permits the capturing of images
of wider sections of the sky than most other telescopes, will make
the device a leader in astronomical research. Two particular areas
of expected strength are deep-field research and the quest to find
other solar systems.
</P>
<P>
   Deep-field research involves collecting information on the
darkest, most remote regions of space in an effort to understand
the evolution of the universe and predict its future. The search
for new planets outside of our solar system, meanwhile, requires
the spotting of extremely faint objects that on the scale of the
universe are not only distant, but like our own solar system's
planets, are relatively tiny.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview during testing of the telescope last March,
Subaru's director, Dr. Norio Kaifu, who previously directed
research at Japan's large radio telescope at Nobeyama, fairly
brimmed with confidence about these capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been many reports of the discovery of planets
outside of our solar system, but no one has yet produced clear
images,'' said Kaifu. ``Clearly this represents demanding work, but
we want to show these planets.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what Japanese name might be given to the first planet
discovered by Subaru, Kaifu laughed. ``We don't plan to discover
only one,'' he said. ``We will find many.''
</P>
<P>
   And in making the search, many are betting that the Subaru team
will reinvigorate Japan's interest in astronomy, and indeed, its
investment in science generally.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the history of Japan, you realize that we
imported science from the Western world only about 100 years ago,
so it is quite natural that we are behind in many ways,'' said
Kaifu. ``With Subaru we have reached a very high peak, but there is
still not much of a base beneath our feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps our biggest impact will be in encouraging the future
scientists of Japan.''

   THERAPIES: New Blood to Treat Multiple Sclerosis
</P>
<P>
   A new Mayo Clinic study has found that a treatment known as
plasma exchange can help end severe attacks of multiple sclerosis
that do not respond to standard medications.
</P>
<P>
   In plasma exchange treatment, a patient's blood is removed, and
the blood cells are separated from the fluid in which they are
carried, known as plasma. The plasma is then replaced with an
artificial substitute before the blood is returned.
</P>
<P>
   Most multiple sclerosis patients suffer periodic attacks of
inflammation of central nervous system tissue, during which they
can lose the ability to move, talk and even breathe. Most get
better on their own, or through treatment with anti-inflammatory
steroids, said Dr. Brian G. Weinshenker, a neurologist at the
clinic who was the lead investigator on the study. But not all
patients respond to steroid treatment, and repeated acute attacks
eventually lead to nerve fiber damage and progressive
deterioration.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which was presented earlier this month at a
conference in Switzerland, involved 22 patients with multiple
sclerosis or closely related diseases. Half the patients began with
plasma exchange, and the other half with a sham treatment; the
double-blinded study design called for any patient not responding
to two weeks of their initial treatment to switch to the other, so
as not to deprive desperately ill patients of a chance at recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Two patients died during the study, and one improved while
receiving the sham treatment. Of the 19 others who received plasma
exchange, 8 showed moderate to marked improvement, regaining use of
their arms and legs and their ability to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Weinshenker cautioned that plasma exchange is not a treatment
for chronic severe multiple sclerosis, but rather a potential tool
for those whose serious acute attacks are beyond the reach of
steroid treatment. ``The story as we see it is that it gives some
patients a chance to be rescued by removing something in their
plasma that was sustaining the attack,'' he said.

   PATTERNS: Heeding Doctor's Orders on Gun Safety
</P>
<P>
   Pediatricians routinely counsel families about the importance of
seat belts and smoke alarms. The American Academy of Pediatrics has
long urged its members to add gun safety to that list _ but with
less success, according to a new study reported in the September
issue of the journal Pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
   The study finds that although pediatricians are willing to
discuss the topic with their patients, they may not be good judges
of which families need the information. In a survey of 66
pediatricians, virtually all agreed that they should discuss gun
safety with families who own guns. But when it came to identifying
those families, the doctors often missed the mark: when 169 of
their patients were surveyed, it turned out that nearly a third of
the families judged least likely to own guns reported owning at
least one.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, Dr. Elise Becher of the Mount Sinai School of
Medicine and Dr. Nicholas Christakis of the University of Chicago,
concluded that rather than relying on their own judgment,
pediatricians should ask all families whether they own guns. The
two doctors noted that research has suggested that when
pediatricians do offer advice on gun safety, families are likely to
take it seriously.
</P>
<P>
   And some of them can offer firsthand advice: 14 percent of the
pediatricians surveyed reported owning guns themselves.

   NUTRITION: Eat Your Onions and Save Your Bones
</P>
<P>
   An onion a day could help keep osteoporosis away, suggests a
study reported in the current issue of the journal Nature. Drs.
Roman C. Muehlbauer and Feng Li of the University of Bern in
Switzerland found that 14 vegetables common in the diet can
significantly alter bone metabolism in rats and perhaps decrease
the incidence of osteoporosis in humans.
</P>
<P>
   When male rats were fed one gram of dry onion per day, bone
resorption _ the process in which calcium is released from bone
stores, thereby weakening the bones _ was inhibited by 20 percent.
That was slightly higher than the effect of calcitonin at doses
used to treat osteoporosis in women past menopause.
</P>
<P>
   Because osteoporosis occurs most frequently in postmenopausal
women, the researchers performed the same experiments on rats with
their ovaries removed.
</P>
<P>
   In these rats, bone resorption was 32 percent higher than the
normal rat but also was inhibited by onion intake.
</P>
<P>
   The results suggest that in addition to a moderate intake of
dairy products or a calcium supplement, the diet should include a
good mix of vegetables, Muehlbauer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that once the effects have been confirmed in humans,
it will be possible to slow down bone loss and, ultimately, reduce
the incidence of osteoporosis,'' he said.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a famous person is found to have a serious and potentially
fatal disease, it often serves as a wake-up call for the rest of
us. Just as Nancy Reagan's breast cancer stimulated a rush for
mammography, the recently diagnosed colon cancer of Justice Ruth
Bader Ginsburg of the Supreme Court should jolt all women (and men)
over 50 _ and some younger people as well _ to take advantage of
the tests that can detect this disease while it is still curable,
perhaps even before it has become cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer of the colon and rectum is the second leading cause of
cancer deaths in the United States, after lung cancer. It is also
one of the most curable of cancers, but only if it is found in its
early stages. Because colorectal cancer usually develops over many
years and has a long precancerous stage, it can be detected early
and even prevented if people adhere to the screening guidelines
recommended by the American Cancer Society, among others.
</P>
<P>
   More than 90 percent of people survive colorectal cancer when it
is detected and treated while still confined to the site where it
arose. But only 37 percent of cases are discovered that early. In
its early stages colorectal cancer is often a silent disease,
producing no symptoms at all, which is why periodic screening to
detect hidden disease is so important.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Ginsburg's cancer was found only after she experienced
significant symptoms, which were initially misdiagnosed as
diverticulitis and which suggest she may have a more advanced stage
of the disease. It is not known whether Justice Ginsburg had ever
had any of the recommended screening tests, but by her age, 66, the
guidelines suggest she should have had at least two colon exams as
well as 16 tests for hidden blood in the stool.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, women tend to think of colorectal cancer as a
man's disease, and even those women who regularly have mammograms
and Pap smears tend to ignore their colons. But the disease shows
no sex discrimination; if anything, it hits women slightly harder
than men. This year about 67,000 women _ 4,600 more women than men
_ will be found to have colorectal cancer, and 28,800 women _ 1,000
more women than men _ will die of this disease. And while overall
death rates from colorectal cancer have been dropping in this
country, among African-Americans they have risen by 9 percent in
the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1986 the incidence of colorectal cancer has been declining
by more than 1 percent a year. Researchers at the University of
Illinois at Chicago recently attributed this decline to an
increased use of screening tests and to the removal of precancerous
polyps found as a result. Their study indicated that changes in
diet and life style have played only a minor role in the decline.
But a survey conducted in 1997 among 52,754 men and women ages 50
and older by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
revealed that only a minority of Americans in that age group have
ever taken advantage of the available screening tests.
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons why such life-saving measures are not
better used: the preparation is off-putting, there is often
discomfort and embarrassment, and the screening costs money.
Insurance rarely covers the cost of the most comprehensive tests
when used as screening tools. In a typical insurance Catch-22, only
those people who already have suspicious symptoms of cancer would
be covered.
</P>
<P>
   The simplest and cheapest of the tests _ a digital rectal exam
by the doctor and a self-test for hidden blood in the feces _ are
also, unfortunately, the least accurate, although the occult blood
test can reduce the risk of dying from colon cancer by more than 33
percent, according to the Harvard Center for Cancer Prevention. The
occult blood test can help detect a problem because colorectal
cancers and precancerous polyps often _ but not always _ bleed
slightly, depositing tiny amounts of blood on the surface of bowel
movements.
</P>
<P>
   The most commonly used version, Hemoccult II, involves smearing
a bit of feces on test cards for three consecutive days, then
mailing the cards for chemical analysis.
</P>
<P>
   For two days before the test and during the three test days you
are advised to avoid certain foods and drugs that may distort the
results. Drugs like aspirin, ibuprofen and other nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatories as well as iron, reserpine and persantine can
cause slight gastrointestinal bleeding and should not be taken.
Doses of vitamin C greater than 250 milligrams, which can mask the
presence of blood, should also be avoided. You may also be told to
refrain from consuming red meat, citrus juices and fruits,
cantaloupe, radishes, broccoli, cauliflower and turnips and not to
have any dental work done until after the test.
</P>
<P>
   There are two other fecal tests on the market, EZ Detect and
Colocare, that have few dietary restrictions and do not require
direct handling of feces. But they have not been tested as
thoroughly and are subject to other sources of inaccuracy.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining tests, which allow the doctor to examine the
lining of the colon and rectum, require a thorough cleansing of the
bowel beforehand via enemas and laxatives. The old rigid
proctoscopes have been replaced by a more comfortable instrument
called a flexible sigmoidoscope, which allows the doctor to
directly view the bottom third of the bowel, where about 40 percent
of colorectal cancers arise. Of course, this means that in nearly
two-thirds of cases, a cancer will be missed. Still, this test,
which can be done in the doctor's office and requires no sedation,
can be used as an indicator: if any abnormality is found, a more
thorough exam can be done of the entire five or six feet of large
intestine.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The two most thorough exams are the colonoscopy, which uses a
lighted scope to examine the entire length of the colon and is done
in a hospital or clinic under mild sedation, and the
double-contrast barium enema, an X-ray exam in which the colon is
filled with barium and air.
</P>
<P>
   Colonoscopy has the advantage of enabling the doctor to biopsy
suspicious lesions or remove polyps during the exam. However, it
typically costs $700 to $1,100, and is usually not reimbursable by
insurance when used for screening in a person without symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Testing Guidelines
</P>
<P>
   Any of the following symptoms, if otherwise unexplained, warrant
a complete colon exam:
</P>
<P>
   A change in bowel habits _ diarrhea, constipation or narrowing
of the stool _ that lasts more than a few days.
</P>
<P>
   A need for a bowel movement that is not relieved by doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Rectal bleeding or blood in the stool.
</P>
<P>
   Cramping or steady abdominal pain.
</P>
<P>
   But no one should wait for symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   The American Cancer Society, which for years has cautioned
people not to ``be embarrassed to death'' by avoiding colorectal
screening tests, recommends that beginning at age 50, both men and
women should follow  &UR; one &LR;  of these three screening options:
</P>
<P>
   -A yearly fecal occult blood test plus flexible sigmoidoscopy
every 5 years.
</P>
<P>
   -A colonoscopy every 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   -A double contrast barium enema every 5 to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, at every colon exam, a digital rectal exam should
also be performed.
</P>
<P>
   For people known to be at unusually high risk of developing
colorectal cancer, there is a different guideline. High-risk
individuals include anyone with a strong family history of
colorectal cancer or polyps (in a first-degree relative before age
60 or in two first-degree relatives at any age); a personal history
of colorectal cancer or adenomatous polyps or a history of chronic
inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease),
and all those in families with hereditary colorectal cancer
syndromes (familial adenomatous polyposis and hereditary
nonpolyposis colon cancer). Such people are usually advised to
begin colorectal screening by age 40 and to be tested more often,
ideally with a colonoscopy.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Medicare coverage was expanded to include colorectal
cancer screening, as follows: for people 50 and older at average
risk of developing the disease, coverage is provided for an annual
occult blood test and for sigmoidoscopy every four years; for
people at high risk, Medicare covers colonoscopy every two years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to regular screening, which can detect precancerous
lesions in the colon and rectum, several behavioral adjustments can
reduce your risk of developing a cancer of the bowel. Studies of
many thousands of people indicate that the risk is increased by
obesity, diets high in red meat, smoking and having more than one
drink a day. And it is lowered by regular physical exercise, diets
rich in vegetables and possibly whole grains, and multivitamins
with folic acid.

AFTER 9,000 YEARS, OLDEST PLAYABLE FLUTE IS HEARD AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., N.Y.)   (af)  
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chinese archeologists have unearthed what is believed to be the
oldest known playable musical instrument, a seven-holed flute
fashioned 9,000 years ago from the hollow wing bone of a large
bird.
</P>
<P>
   The instrument, about nine inches long, is the best preserved of
six intact flutes found with fragments of about 30 others at Jiahu,
a remarkably rich but little known archeological site in the Yellow
River valley in Henan province in central China. Radiocarbon dating
shows the site was occupied for 1,300 years beginning around 7000
B.C., during the early Neolithic period in China.
</P>
<P>
   Nine millennia after lips last touched it, the flute was played
again and its tones analyzed. The seven holes produced a rough
scale covering a modern octave, beginning close to the second A
above middle C.
</P>
<P>
   There is evidence that the flute was tuned: a small hole drilled
next to the seventh hole had the effect of raising that hole's tone
from roughly G-sharp to A, completing the octave.
</P>
<P>
   (To hear the flute on the Internet:
http://www.nytimes.com/science.)
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to know what relationship, if any, the tones
have to six- or seven-tone Chinese scales first documented 6,000
years later (the other intact flutes have five to eight holes, but
are not playable because of their condition). But the fact that the
playable flute had a carefully selected tone scale indicates that
the Neolithic musicians may have been able to play more than single
notes, but actual music.
</P>
<P>
   While fragments of what appear to be flutes made from animal
bones have been found at much older Neanderthal sites, the Chinese
instruments are the oldest ones that have remained intact. They
were discovered more than a decade ago, but are only now being
described in the West in a paper in the journal Nature, the result
of an unusual collaboration between the Chinese researchers and a
scientist at Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese scientists had only published their work in journals
in their own country, which in terms of making it known worldwide
``is as effective as entombing it in the Great Pyramids,'' said the
Brookhaven scientist, Garman Harbottle, an expert in using nuclear
science in archeological and fine arts applications.
</P>
<P>
   Through contacts in China, Harbottle was invited to visit with
Chinese archeologists and specialists in radiocarbon dating. On a
side trip, he was taken to Henan province and shown items from the
Jiahu dig.
</P>
<P>
   ``They showed me shelves and shelves of artifacts that they had
taken out of this site over about six years,'' Harbottle said. The
artifacts included pottery and ceramics and items made from stone
and bone. Their number and variety were astounding, Harbottle said.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the visit, the Chinese scientists opened a
safe and took out the flutes. ``I was absolutely astounded,'' said
Harbottle, who persuaded his Chinese colleagues that the discovery
should be published in the West. He helped analyze the radiocarbon
data and wrote the Nature paper.
</P>
<P>
   The flutes are made from the bones of the red-crowned crane, a
fact that could have significance in Chinese culture, said James
C.Y. Watt, Brooke Russell Astor curator of Asian art at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. He said there was a Chinese
legend, first documented about 2,000 years ago, of people who could
summon cranes by playing on the flute.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is no way of knowing the origin of the legend,
Watt said he was fascinated by ``this very distant connection
between the flute and the crane.''
</P>
<P>
   The flutes, found in some of the more than 300 graves uncovered
at the site, almost certainly were used in rituals, said Frederick
Lau, an ethnomusicologist and associate professor at California
Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo. They may have been
used as bronze bells dating back 2,000 years were used, at temple
fairs, burials and other ritualistic events.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I wouldn't exclude the fact that flutes could have been
used for personal entertainment,'' Lau said. More modern bamboo
flutes were used in official rites, particularly in the military,
going back many hundreds of years, but they were also widely used
in the popular music of regional cultures and played an important
role in Chinese opera.
</P>
<P>
   The flutes are only the most remarkable artifacts from Jiahu,
less than 5 percent of which has been excavated. More than 40 house
foundations have been uncovered, as have 370 cellars and 9 pottery
kilns.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs at the site of rice cultivation, Watt said,
adding to speculation about which Asian culture first domesticated
rice. And the middens, the site's refuse pits, contain remains of
many animal species, Harbottle said, indicating that the Jiahu
people had a rich diet.
</P>
<P>
   Also uncovered at Jiahu, Watt said, were pictograms, signs
carved on tortoise shells. Similar artifacts have been found among
the remains of a culture that flourished in the second millennium
B.C., he said.
</P>
<P>
   In that culture, the shells were used as a form of divination.
They were touched by a piece of hot metal, and resulting cracks
were interpreted as good or bad omens, with the results carved
permanently on the shell. The discovery of shell pictograms at
Jiahu, Watt said, ``means that this form of divination may have
gone back thousands of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Jiahu may turn out to be one of the most important sites for
understanding the early underpinnings of Chinese society, when
humans left the caves of the Stone Age and began practicing
agriculture and establishing permanent settlements.
</P>
<P>
   ``The site would be a very exciting and important one,''
Harbottle said, given all the other artifacts discovered there.
``The flutes were just icing on the cake.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ I have a pretty odd sports closet. For one thing,
it's an armoire. For another, it's crammed with gear more suited to
mountains, rivers and ``Rocky'' than the asphalt playground known
as New York City. Open it and out tumbles a rock-climbing harness,
ski wax, a headlamp and a mouth guard. And that's just the first
wave. But you'll never be bonked by bats, clubs or balls; I've
never been much for conventional sports.
</P>
<P>
   Still, strangers always assume I play basketball.
</P>
<P>
   I wish.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 feet 10 and 33, I'm fit and agile. I can guide a raft down
the hairiest whitewater, I can run and ski faster than most men I
know, my backhand rips, and in 1996 I won the Golden Gloves of
boxing in my weight class. But make me dribble a basketball without
looking at it, and suddenly it's, ``Danger, Will Robinson.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, it has always been so. In fifth grade, while
enthusiastically trying out for my middle school basketball team, I
publicly failed dribbling and badly improvised my first layup ever,
only to become acutely aware that coaches were not seeking untapped
potential. Even at that level, coaches wanted those who showed
talent.
</P>
<P>
   So why open the old wound?
</P>
<P>
   Ever since I moved to the basketball capital of the world, I
have wanted to play pickup without being laughed into oblivion. Who
hasn't? But where do you get game in this city? Every nearby gym I
called offered an adult league, but no adult instruction. And you
hate to beg pals to sacrifice their sunny weekends, or worse, risk
ruining perfectly civilized friendships.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Never Too Late Basketball. For $219 and 10 consecutive
Tuesdays, I could join other strangers in need of dire remedial
help. We would cover ball handling, shooting and elementary
strategy, and for no additional fee, devise ways to deke around the
traffic to arrive at the West 70th Street gym on time.
</P>
<P>
   Day 1 arrives, and it feels more like a test than a lesson. The
emphasis: ball handling. I already know I am a miserable dribbler,
but I quickly learn that I am miserable at so much more: dribbling
between my legs, for example. I presume (naively, in retrospect)
that every drill we are asked to perform must be within our
capabilities and must be crucial to the game or we would not be
covering it in a novice class. Still, the keys to mastering these
moves remain mysterious, especially how to bounce the ball under
your legs without having it hit you in the crotch. Viewed en masse,
this must be hilarious, but no one laughs.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, we seven students don't chat much at all at first, but
I am thankful that the group comprises men and women, tall and
short, athletic and nonathletic.
</P>
<P>
   The first few weeks, during the summer, feature an assortment of
instructors while we await a permanent coach, and we glean the
benefits of their diverse wisdom. Still, I am forever chasing
errant balls and apologizing every time mine caroms off my
classmates. Somehow, I've turned basketball into dodgeball.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, we meet our permanent coach, Dave Olson, who
also coaches a high school team. Olson is patient, humorous,
good-natured and, though he doesn't say it, probably has an easier
time teaching teen-age boys.
</P>
<P>
   However, one beauty of learning a sport late in life is that
coaches may employ a cerebral approach, complete with mnemonic
devices. To improve our shooting, Olson recommends BEEF. B means
``Balance your weight'' evenly over both feet. E is for elbow, as
in ``Bend your elbow 90 degrees'' so your upper arm is parallel to
the floor. The next E means ``Eyes on the rim,'' and after you
shoot, remember to F, ``Follow through,'' by letting the ball roll
off your fingers. We try to shoot with one arm behind our back.
Later, we incorporate the other hand as a guide (or in my case, to
block my view).
</P>
<P>
   We also spend part of every week untangling our unwieldy layups.
Step-step-launch: This is basketball's jete as well as its bread
and butter. I expend tremendous effort on this effortless-looking
move, mostly trying to finesse the approach. And finally, when I am
able to stride up to the net with confidence and speed, I freeze
under the basket, stunned that I've just lifted the wrong arm and
leg or stepped off the wrong foot.
</P>
<P>
   For me, the layup is not only alien, it's physiologically
counterintuitive to the sports I've played. From running and
cross-country skiing, I've learned to coordinate my left arm with
my right leg, none of this same-side synchrony. From heading soccer
balls and ski racing, I've learned to jump with both feet at once,
not to make this one-legged launch.
</P>
<P>
   Olson, who also coaches track and field at Hackley School in
Tarrytown, N.Y., said, ``Think high jump.'' Once you get the
two-step approach and know which foot to take off on, just whip
your knee skyward (the quicker the better) and off you go.
Sometimes it actually works.
</P>
<P>
   Then he mercifully ends our layup circus to suggest a little
full-court four-on-four. ``Any questions?''
</P>
<P>
   I have so many, I'm momentarily mute. The coach tosses the ball
to my teammate. Belatedly, I blurt, ``Do we have to worry about
rules or anything?'' Gales of laughter echo off the floorboards. I
guess that's a no.
</P>
<P>
   So I defer to soccer, the only other team sport I've played. I
mark my man, trying to steer him out of bounds. I have good
footwork from boxing, and I'm fast. Better yet, I discover that the
faster you run, the less you have to dribble. I'm not afraid to
steal the ball, and my errant shots occasionally sink. I quickly
realize that basketball is just fancy keep-away. I can do this.
</P>
<P>
   In the next session, Olson shatters that myth. He teaches us the
only play that seems to matter (because we rehearse it every week
thereafter), and I'm immediately plagued by the pick-and-roll
blues. What is a pick and a roll? To find out, I poll more
experienced players. They all know it when they see it, but
definitions vary widely.
</P>
<P>
   Here's mine: It's offensive defense. If your teammate has the
ball, you run toward him hoping to stymie his defender. That means
you also drag your own defender into the fray. Then, somehow, amid
all the commotion, your ball-holding teammate magically eludes all
three of you and trots down the open lane for a layup. Of course,
it's effective only as long as you can read the court and your
teammate understands what you're doing when you're suddenly in her
face. It also helps if your teammate can actually do a layup.
</P>
<P>
   To insure that we learn this fundamental play, Coach Olson
offers us several creative drills. Usually, it involves a
give-and-go to the pick-and-roll, but since there are only seven of
us on a good day, and because we change lines after each attempted
drill, the pick becomes a knot and the roll becomes a revolving
door.
</P>
<P>
   Before you can say WNBA, 10 weeks are over. A few people
actually grasped the pick and roll, and by now, even I can
recognize a pick. It's the play in which I try to ram through a
three-person wall.
</P>
<P>
   My classmates are already discussing returning for the fall
session. As much as I'd love to re-enroll, a full-time job beckons.
But I've been playing weekly pickup in the meantime, learning the
rules the hard way, and though I don't completely have game yet, I
at least have the tools. Not to mention a nubby orange ball in my
armoire.

   They're not going to huff and they're not going to puff, but
researchers at the University of California at San Diego (UCSD) are
wielding 10 huge hydraulic jacks that could easily bring down a
shoddily constructed house down.
</P>
<P>
   The team is using the jacks to subject a 60-percent-scale model
of a five-story concrete building to a series of simulated
earthquakes; like the third little pig, they believe they've got a
better building technique that will keep their structure standing.
</P>
<P>
   The testing is the culmination of a 10-year collaboration
between universities, industry and the National Science Foundation
to develop seismically sound structures using prefabricated, or
``precast,'' concrete.
</P>
<P>
   Builders generally prefer precast to poured-in-place concrete _
it's cheaper and faster to erect. What's more, factory fabrication
allows for better quality control and frees a project from the
whims of the weather.
</P>
<P>
   But conventional precast construction is susceptible to damage
from earthquakes, and building codes have traditionally frowned
upon its use in earthquake-prone areas such as the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   That could be all about to change. UCSD Professor of Structural
Engineering Nigel Priestley, who coordinates the collaboration,
says that the results will form the basis of new design
recommendations and ultimately new building codes.
</P>
<P>
   Tests will give data on four different systems for connecting
columns and beams, two approaches to flooring and one method of
connecting wall panels. Researchers will simulate several
earthquakes of increasing intensity by pushing on the structure
with the hydraulic actuators.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers expect the tests to show that _ if the right
methods are used _ the precast concrete systems actually perform as
well as, or better than, those dictated by existing codes. &QL;

BUILDING ROBOT AIDES TO FOLLOW ASTRONAUTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (af)  
 By WARREN LEARY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Astronauts on the International Space Station may
get tiny robot helpers to assist them in daily chores and to buzz
around their orbiting outpost, monitoring its condition.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a page from science fiction, engineers at the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration's Ames Research Center at
Moffett Field, Calif., are developing small robot buddies that
could tag along with astronauts and act as personal assistants.
</P>
<P>
   Developers envision little round robots about the size of
softballs that are propelled by tiny fans through the
weightlessness of a space station or shuttle. Hovering over the
astronauts' shoulders and responding to voice commands, the
devices, equipped with cameras, speakers, microphones and a variety
of sensors, could serve as additional sets of eyes, ears and noses
for the crew in space and the support staff on the ground,
engineers say.
</P>
<P>
   The jobs imagined for these robot aides range from the essential
to the mundane. As an astronaut works on an experiment with both
hands in a glove box, for instance, the mechanical assistant could
serve as a communications link with an Earth-bound researcher
watching from afar.
</P>
<P>
   The devices also could patrol the corridors of the space
station, checking for gas leaks, smoke and unusual bacterial
growth, or remind astronauts about the next tasks on their daily
to-do lists or of the need to send a birthday message to a loved
one at home.
</P>
<P>
   Yuri O. Gawdiak, the principal engineer on the project, said the
idea of the personal satellite assistant, or PSA, came to him after
an experiment between the American space shuttle Atlantis and the
Russian Mir space station in 1996. That mission showed that laptop
and palmtop computers could use radio signals to exchange
information on a wireless network without interfering with other
electronic systems aboard the spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, astronauts told engineers that they wanted wireless
palmtops, or even smaller portable data assistants, that could
record and monitor data like the fictional tricorder devices
popularized by Star Trek, Gawdiak said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took it a step further when I noticed that crews on missions
left equipment to float around when they got busy,'' he said. ``I
thought they would like a device that would always face them when
floating, perhaps something stabilized by gyroscopes.''
</P>
<P>
   Gawdiak said the idea evolved further when he saw astronauts on
a shuttle mission demonstrate toys in weightlessness during an
educational program. Small wind-up toys hopped and flew around the
cabin with startling speed and ease, he said, spurring ideas of
practical mobile devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I saw `Star Wars' and there was a scene in the movie when
the characters used a remote robot object _ a fast-moving ball _ to
practice with their light sabers,'' he said. ``And that gave me
more ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   The device, as now envisioned, is a ball about 5 inches in
diameter that is studded with sensors for rangefinders, motion
detectors and position trackers to keep it from running into things
or getting lost. The battery-powered PSA could move in any
direction using six tiny enclosed propeller fans and have a
flat-screen video panel on one side to display data.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is small enough to be unobtrusive,'' and big enough to
hold the technology that will be available in the next couple of
years to do the job,'' Gawdiak said.
</P>
<P>
   It would be impossible for each PSA to carry the computing power
and instruments for all the things people suggest these helpers
could do, which is where the wireless data network comes into play.
The robots would operate from a base station that would contain
powerful computers for analyzing sensor data, running
speech-recognition and voice-synthesizer software, relaying
communications and tracking the devices.
</P>
<P>
   The station also would contain docking ports for recharging the
PSA's batteries, and a variety of sensors that could be snapped
onto the robots, depending on tasks assigned to them.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, engineers at Ames completed a crucial test
of the robots' components by mounting them on a hoverplate and
guiding them around a test table on a cushion of air. And the team
has received financing to develop a prototype.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to launch a personal satellite assistant in about two
years aboard a space shuttle and in about three years aboard the
International Space Station,'' Gawdiak said. The space station, a
$60 billion project involving the United States and 16 other
nations, will eventually house up to seven astronaut-researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Developers would like to use at least three PSAs on the station
to demonstrate the technology. That would allow the devices to work
in formation to zero in on environmental problems, such as a
temperature spike or a leak.
</P>
<P>
   The devices might also be used in conjunction with robot
sentries that are being considered for work outside the space
station.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 3, 1997, the shuttle Columbia demonstrated a
free-flying, remote-controlled robot camera called Aercam Sprint,
developed at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. Astronauts guided
the beachball-size device, powered by gas jets, outside the shuttle
for more than an hour to show that it could be used, instead of a
human space-walker, to inspect the exterior of a spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   Gawdiak said that, ideally, he would like each crew member on
the space station to have a PSA pal customized for his or her work
schedule. The device could do everything from waking the crew
member each day to checking ahead to see that equipment is in place
for the human's next assigned task.
</P>
<P>
   So far, astronauts have been very supportive of the PSA concept
and understand how the devices could be useful, he said. But
acceptance will depend upon convincing crews that the robots help
them work more efficiently, are safe and are not bothersome.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crew does not want a `Big Brother' up there that will
intrude and get in the way,'' Gawdiak said. ``If they don't want it
around sometimes, they have to be able to tell it to go away.''

   KOSOVO-ARRESTS (Mitrovica, Kosovo) _ Twenty-six men from one

since Serb police forced them out from their apartments and
separated them from their wives and children in the street below.
On Monday, their relatives were called to the main police station
here and were told by French gendarmes of the men's fate. It seems
that minutes after the women and children were ordered to flee on
that terrible day, April 14, the men were all executed. The news
brought to an end the families' long search for their menfolk, and
a conclusion to the extensive three-month investigation by the
French. The case is seen as a first in Kosovo where foreign
investigators have conducted a complete investigation, working from
the first reports of missing people to finding a mass grave and
arresting suspects. By Carlotta Gall.

STROKE VICTIM MAKES PROGRESS AFTER FETAL PIG CELL TRANSPLANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL GRONDAHL  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ A champagne cork popped as a dozen
family members and friends gathered around Maribeth Cook to toast
the homecoming of the world's first stroke patient to receive an
experimental fetal pig brain cell transplant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all been so amazing. I can't believe it was that quick
and easy,'' said Cook, 39, as she sipped from a flute of bubbly.
</P>
<P>
   Cook showed off how quickly her thick, curly brown hair had
grown in over a small surgical scar and swapped pig jokes with her
guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been walking on air since she got home,'' said her
husband, Paul Cook.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maribeth is an inspiration,'' said her father, Charles
Verdile.
</P>
<P>
   Six days earlier, on Sept. 1, Cook was in Brookline, Mass., at
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, with a metal frame bolted to
her head and a foot-long needle inserted deep into her brain
through a nickel-sized opening bored in her skull. Cook's results
on post-surgical tests have exceeded her doctors' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a dramatic, new procedure, and she did terrific,''
said Dr. Louis Caplan, neurologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Center, co-investigator of Cook's clinical trial and an
internationally renowned authority on stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Caplan considered the experiment into uncharted medical
territory already something of a success. ``What's most important
at this point is that her condition didn't get any worse,'' Caplan
said. ``That's significant.'' In fact, Cook's post-operative
progress was so strong that Caplan deemed unnecessary a scheduled
follow-up visit in Boston in three weeks. Instead, he will see her
at the scheduled one-month checkup on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Caplan cautioned that periodic follow-up tests, over the next 18
months, remain to determine whether the 30 million fetal pig brain
cells Cook received actually work as intended: to repair Cook's
stroke-damaged brain and to restore lost function on her partially
paralyzed left side.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a long way to go, and there's a lot to learn,'' Caplan
said. ``But this is potentially a very important advance for stroke
patients.'' An estimated 550,000 Americans suffer strokes each
year, with about 160,000 people dying as a result, making stroke
the third leading cause of death in the United States and the
leading cause of disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cook's homecoming party was a celebration about her
future hopes for recovery, the memories of a long, difficult
struggle could not be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Cook took a photo of her 1992 wedding off a shelf and studied
the radiant bride. ``That's when I had two arms and two legs, and I
want that back,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Cook, 51, who has a college-aged daughter in New Mexico
from a previous relationship, met his future wife in the dentist's
chair. He was her patient when she worked as a dental hygienist in
Clifton Park, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maribeth is one of those special, dynamic people who could
make a trip to the dentist fun,'' said Cook, a sixth-grade math and
science teacher for 29 years. ``You're just drawn to her energy.''
</P>
<P>
   After their marriage, the Cooks, who do not have children,
traveled extensively and enjoyed cycling and playing tennis and
golf together. Both made a point of keeping fit. She took aerobics
classes and was in excellent physical condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the perfect life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Their world was shattered on Oct. 4, 1994, when Cook, then 34,
suffered a severe stroke that left her partially paralyzed on her
left side. Doctors have not been able to determine a cause for that
debilitating stroke, or a milder one in 1993 that had left few
noticeable effects.
</P>
<P>
   Almost five years of intensive therapy and workouts with a
personal trainer restored some of the lost function in Cook's
paralyzed left side. With the help of a brace on her left calf, she
can walk with a halting, limping gait. Her left arm and hand remain
rigid.
</P>
<P>
   Cook's husband, her brothers and sister and her parents, Marie
and Charles Verdile of Mechanicville, N.Y., rallied around Maribeth
during her long rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband and family have pulled me through. If it wasn't for
them, I would have given up long ago,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cook's stroke strengthened her parents' Catholic faith. ``My mom
prayed enough for all of us,'' Maribeth said.
</P>
<P>
   That faith was tested again on May 31, 1998, when a devastating
tornado destroyed their neighborhood in Mechanicville. Her parents'
home suffered only minor damage and was one of just four on the
street left standing. A house 100 feet away was leveled.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just don't know why Maribeth suffered her stroke or why we
were spared in the tornado,'' her father said.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Verdile recalled that ``ever since Maribeth was a little
girl, she's been tough and full of determination. Her fighting
spirit has brought her back this far.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook has wasted no time in her current rehabilitation. She spent
a 45-minute session with her occupational therapist, Amy Porter,
the morning after her homecoming party. The news was upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Porter compared pre-surgery measurements on Aug. 26 with
post-surgery measurements on Sept. 8 and found modest improvements
in range of motion of Cook's partially paralyzed left shoulder and
elbow, and better tone in her rigid left arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still tight, but there was a noticeable improvement in
tone,'' Porter said. Before and after tests confirmed a 5-percent
to 10-percent increase in Cook's range of motion. ``That's pretty
significant in therapy circles,'' Porter explained.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after the surgery, Cook started a part-time job
answering phones and taking reservations at the Saratoga Spa State
Park Golf Course, where her father works as a cashier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives me a place to go and a purpose,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cook has increased her therapy sessions to six per week. She
said she seemed to have more control and walked less rigidly and
flat-footed three weeks after the surgery. Friends have noticed a
new spark of optimism in her voice, too. ``I've got hope now.
Before, I didn't,'' she said.

EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT MAKES STRIDES IN TREATING PATIENTS WITH
GLAUCOMA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ERIC BERGER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A new treatment for glaucoma, one of a growing arsenal
of therapies, may offer hope to the millions of Americans affected
by the painful and incurable eye disease.
</P>
<P>
   The South African physician who developed the new therapy early
this decade, Dr. Robert Stegmann, boasts it has succeeded in
stopping the progression of the disease for 80 percent to 90
percent of his patients, but only in the last few years have other
ophthamologists begun to practice the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment, called a viscocanalostomy, offers a number of
advantages over traditional surgical techniques _ it does not cut
as deeply into the eye as other procedures _ but has yet to win
universal acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still experimental,'' said Dr. Amy Coburn, a clinical
associate professor of ophthamology at Baylor College of Medicine
in Houston. ``I don't think it's something necessarily offering a
distinct advantage over other treatment methods.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, glaucoma specialists say the technique provides an
alternative for cases in which medicines are ineffective and other
surgical techniques fail or are too risky.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Texas-Houston Medical School's Dr. Robert M.
Feldman, believed to be the first to offer the new surgery to
Houston-area patients, has successfully performed
viscocanalostomies since November.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no long-term data,'' Feldman said. ``So we need to
make sure we have a little caution before we come out and say,
`Hey, this is a great thing.' But it may be.''
</P>
<P>
   About 3 million Americans have glaucoma, a disease in which the
normal fluid pressure in the eyes slowly rises, possibly leading to
blindness.
</P>
<P>
   The disease is five times more likely to occur in blacks than
whites.
</P>
<P>
   At least half of those affected don't know they have glaucoma
because the disease initially lacks noticeable symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Recent public information campaigns on the disease have been
bolstered by former President Bush's admission that he has
glaucoma. The disease also blinded performer Ray Charles.
</P>
<P>
   If glaucoma is diagnosed early enough, doctors can use topical
or oral medication to control the disease.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, however, laser or conventional surgery, in which
physicians essentially cut a hole in the eye to drain excess fluid,
is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an unnatural thing,'' said Dr. Alan L. Robin, an
ophthamologist who teaches at Johns Hopkins University and the
University of Maryland. Robin has traveled to South Africa to study
Stegmann's work. ``We're trying to find a safer way of getting the
fluid out of the eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditional surgery carries several complications, such as
irritation on the eye's surface, infection and a greater likelihood
of developing a cataract. In addition, the operation may need to be
repeated after several years as the hole closes up.
</P>
<P>
   Although viscocanalostomies take about as long as conventional
surgery, about 35 minutes, they do not require an incision that
cuts entirely through the eye and so have shown fewer postoperative
complications, doctors said. And if Stegmann's results hold up, it
should prove to be equally effective as traditional methods.
</P>
<P>
   One drawback to the procedure is its technical difficulty, said
Feldman, noting the surgery has ``a steep learning curve.'' There
are few peer-reviewed studies on the procedure, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Feldman hopes his success will generate funding from the
National Institutes of Health for a five-year study of the
technique. If the study is successful, he said, it would likely
lead to wider acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first heard of a non-penetrating approach to glaucoma
surgery, I was quite curious and very skeptical,'' wrote Dr. Gavin
Bahadur, a Santa Monica, Calif., ophthamologist in the July 15
issue of Ophthamology Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``As with any new technique, many experts remain quite guarded
about viscocanalostomy,'' added Bahadur, who, like Robin, has
traveled to South Africa to see Stegmann's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nonetheless, this procedure promises excellent results with
few complications and is clearly worthy of additional
investigation.''

THE `HISTORY' OF CHRIS GAINES
</HEADLINE>

(Runs with GARTH-BROOKS mainbar) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Just who is Chris Gaines, the fictional rock star
Garth Brooks portrays on his new album?
</P>
<P>
   Well, according to his extensive fake bio, his full name is
actually Christian Gene Gaines, born Aug. 10, 1967, in Brisbane,
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   His father was Gene Gaines, a former swim coach for Long Beach
State University and former coach of both U.S. and Australian
Olympic swim teams. His mom was Carolyn Johnns-Gaines, a former
swimmer for Australia's Olympic team and a Commonwealth Games
medalist.
</P>
<P>
   The family moved to Los Angeles when only-child Chris was 5.
While expected to follow his parents in athletic pursuits, he
instead developed an interest in music and dropped out of
Morningside High School in his senior year to pursue it
professionally.
</P>
<P>
   His first success came when Gaines and pal Tommy Levitz, plus
Marc Obed, formed the band Crush, signed by Capitol in 1985. The
band's debut album was released the following year, and the second
single from the record, ``My Love Tells Me So,'' became one of
1986's top sellers.
</P>
<P>
   After Levitz perished in a plane crash that same year, Gaines
began work on his solo debut, ``Straight Jacket,'' released in
1989. The album spent 224 weeks on the Billboard Top 200, earning a
Grammy Award for album of the year. Hits included ``Maybe,''
``White Flag'' and ``Digging for Gold,'' while the album remains
Gaines' most popular effort.
</P>
<P>
   A year after his father's death in 1990, Gaines' dark-themed
sophomore album, ``Fornucopia,'' was issued, spending 18 weeks on
the Billboard charts. The disc included a remake of the 1972 Ramsay
Sellers classic ``It Don't Matter to the Sun'' and ``Main Street,''
which became a hit.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1992, Gaines was involved in a car crash that nearly did
him in. Following six weeks in the hospital, he underwent two years
of plastic surgery on his face, shoulder and hands.
</P>
<P>
   Like a rock-era Garbo, Gaines didn't allow himself to be seen or
photographed, and Capitol released his third solo album,
``Apostle,'' in 1994. It spent two months on the albums chart,
spawning the singles ``Way of the Girl'' and ``Unsigned Letter.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Gaines launched a comeback in 1996 with the album
``Triangle.'' The media dubbed him ``the New Prince'' because of
his look and the r&AMP;b slant in his new music. Hits included
``Driftin' Away,'' ``That's the Way I Remember It'' and ``Snow in
July.''
</P>
<P>
   And that brings us to this Tuesday, when Brooks-as-Gaines
releases the ``greatest hits'' album ``Garth Brooks ... in the Life
of Chris Gaines,'' featuring the hits listed above plus two new
cuts, ``Lost in You'' and ``Right Now.''
</P>
<P>
   The album will supposedly act as a bridge between the early work
and a new solo disc, ``The Lamb,'' already being called the
``definitive album of the new millennium.'' &QL;

THE THEORY BEHIND PIG BRAIN CELL IMPLANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: THIS SIDEBAR accompanies story slugged CELL-TRANSPLANT)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL GRONDAHL  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 30 million fetal pig brain cells injected into Maribeth
Cook's stroke-damaged brain on Sept. 1 were expected to begin
changing and growing immediately in the initial phase of the
transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Dinsmore, senior director of cell transplantation
research for Diacrin Inc., provided this chronology:
</P>
<P>
   _ Once injected into Maribeth Cook's brain, the cells, stored at
36 degrees F., will begin to warm up to body temperature. At body
temperature, the cells begin to metabolize and to consume the
glucose (sugar) in the injection solution for energy.
</P>
<P>
   _ After two days, the fetal pig brain cells, also known as
neurons, will grow an axon extension, a tiny tail-like appendage
capable of conducting impulses away from the cell body.
</P>
<P>
   _ The fetal pig brain cells will continue to grow and divide.
(In laboratory experiments with rats, some recovery from stroke
symptoms was detected after one week following transplant, but
researchers could not determine if that was specifically
attributable to the cell transplant.)
</P>
<P>
   _ An unknown percentage of the fetal pig brain cells will die in
Cook's brain, but researchers have factored in the mortality rate
with the size and shape of Cook's stroke damage and determined that
30 million cells is adequate. The fetal pig brain cells are known
for their ``plasticity,'' meaning they can grow and transform into
several types of cells.
</P>
<P>
   _ The fetal pig brain cells, placed into precise locations of
Cook's stroke-damaged brain, are expected to take their cues from
Cook's own living brain cells in surrounding areas and to follow a
normal human progression.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the weeks and months after the transplant, the fetal pig
brain cells will continue to grow and form tissue indistinguishable
from human tissue. The tissue will form connections with the
healthy and functioning human cells in Cook's brain and begin to
reconnect the burned-out circuitry.
</P>
<P>
   _ The fetal pig brain tissue will eventually stop growing after
it fills in the deadened ``black hole'' of Cook's brain and
receives messages that there is no room left to grow. This natural
cell process is known as ``contact inhibition.'' Humans have
billions of brain cells and each neuron, or brain cell, connects to
hundreds of other neurons, creating trillions of cell connections.
</P>
<P>
   If the fetal pig brain cells successfully complete each of these
stages and restore enough of the cell connections destroyed by
Cook's stroke, theoretically she should regain some of the lost
function in her partially paralyzed left side.
</P>
<P>
   Since Cook is the first stroke patient in the phase-one human
clinical trial, there is no past history to suggest a time frame
for detectable improvement. Some Parkinson's patients transplanted
with fetal pig brain cells showed measurable improvement within 90
days.
</P>
<P>
   The next stroke patient has not yet been scheduled for the
transplant procedure, although discussions are under way with
several other patients who meet certain requirements. Six patients
are being sought for the phase-one trial.

DAVIS CONSIDERS BILL ON E-MAIL EAVESDROPPING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ California Gov. Gray Davis is considering a
bill that would outlaw the monitoring of employee computer e-mail
unless management first produces a written policy everyone is told
about. It would be the first such law in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Like an increasing number of U.S. businesses that rely on
e-mail, the Davis administration has scrutinized the electronic
messages of its employees and reprimanded staff members who spend
too much time goofing off.
</P>
<P>
   Although the administration insists it looked at employee e-mail
in only two cases, several Capitol staff members said they feel
they are being constantly watched.
</P>
<P>
   Many businesses regularly _ and legally _ snoop on their
employees. But staff members in the Legislature say they are
offended that high-level administration officials would even think
about tracking anyone's e-mail. Many of them write to friends in
the administration to discuss legislation, send jokes or just vent
about their pressure-cooker jobs.
</P>
<P>
   After taking office in January, Davis hired several former
employees of the Legislature to shape policy and monitor important
bills. Now some worry the relationship between the Legislature and
Davis could be further chilled because the administration might
read what they write to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Davis spokesman Michael Bustamante said the administration has a
``trigger'' system that sends out an alert when too many messages
are passed back and forth in a short period of time. One employee,
he said, was reprimanded for sending 70 messages, some of them
risque, in a single four-hour period.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's something out of the ordinary,'' Bustamante said,
``then we need to remind people why they're here, which is to work
for the governor and the taxpayers of California.''
</P>
<P>
   Bustamante said everyone in the administration knows about the
e-mail policy.
</P>
<P>
   Bustamante said that a top Davis aide not only counted the
number of e-mails by the employee who sent 70 messages, but had
them printed out and read some of them. But Bustamante said
``nobody is being monitored,'' except when computer staff notice an
``odd amount of usage.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Davis staff director Vince Hall or other top officials
reading e-mail on a regular basis, Bustamante said: ``They have too
much work to do to concern themselves with trying to do what some
people are erroneously suggesting. ... There is no Big Brother
sitting around reading e-mail.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill on Davis' desk, written by state Sen. Debra Bowen,
D-Marina Del Rey, would require businesses to inform their
employees about their electronic eavesdropping policy by March
2000. Otherwise, the practice would be outlawed.
</P>
<P>
   If Davis doesn't veto the bill before his Oct. 10 deadline, the
new law would be the first such protection against secretly reading
e-mail in the nation. A federal attempt failed a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The business-friendly California Employment Law Council opposed
the bill, saying it would require ``overwhelming proof and
mountains of paperwork'' to get every employee to sign a form, as
required by the bill, saying he or she had read the eavesdropping
policy.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by the American Management Association found that
45 percent of large businesses monitor employee e-mail, computer
files and phone calls, an increase of about 10 percent in the past
two years.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 27 percent of the companies surveyed said they
specifically review e-mail messages of their employees, still a 15
percent increase since 1997. The vast majority _ 84 percent _ said
they informed employees about policies regarding reading e-mail or
listening to phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   In the few lawsuits involving office e-mail, the courts have
ruled that even secret monitoring is allowed because the company
owns the computer equipment.

 &HT;     WILLIE McCOVEY RETURNS TO THE S.F. GIANTS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN SHEA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Willie McCovey is coming home.
</P>
<P>
   Before an enthusiastic Candlestick crowd. As an employee of his
longtime team. As arguably the most popular Giant in San Francisco
franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the past decade, McCovey and the Giants have been at
a distance and, sometimes, at odds. It's been a painful time for
the Hall of Fame first baseman _ and not just because of his
separation from the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Once seen as the epitome of youth and strength, McCovey isn't
walking these days. He isn't playing golf. Or driving from his
Woodside home to catch a Giants game. The things he loves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only get around on crutches and walkers,'' said McCovey,
who has undergone more than a dozen knee surgeries in four years
and has three more scheduled, the first in early October.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my last hope of being able to walk on my own and play
golf again. I'm hoping by next season I'll be up and walking. At
least that's my hope.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants are in his corner again, and rehiring the 61-year-old
McCovey to the front office, a move that will be announced at a
Tuesday press conference. His specific duties aren't yet defined,
but more significant is that the sides have reunited and McCovey is
back where he played 19 of his 22 big-league seasons.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to be at Tuesday night's Giants-Dodgers game, the
opener to a series that will serve as Candlestick's last hurrah.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a pregame ceremony, he'll present the Willie Mac
Award, given annually to the most inspirational Giant.
</P>
<P>
   During the ceremony, fans will be informed of the aptly named
McCovey Cove, the area of the China Basin Channel beyond the
right-field wall at Pacific Bell Park, which opens in April. Home
runs to right field will splash into McCovey Cove, where Big Mac
himself would have hit 'em.
</P>
<P>
   Given the magnitude of the moment _ Giants-Dodgers, the last
series, his return to the organization _ McCovey may likely hear
cheers rivaling those of Sept. 18, 1977, when he beat Cincinnati
with a ninth-inning single on Willie McCovey Day at the 'Stick.
</P>
<P>
   That was the year McCovey returned to the Giants following three
seasons with San Diego and Oakland, and now after another absent
stretch, ``Stretch'' is a Giant again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to reassociate myself with the organization,''
McCovey said. ``I know Dusty (Baker) has always wanted me to do
something with the team. There are a lot of things now possible,
now that I'm officially back.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a time McCovey presented the Willie Mac Award, but
he's been relegated to congratulatory phone calls in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   He said his knees have worsened, but he's determined to make a
personal appearance to greet the fans and say farewell to the
'Stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure it'll be a little sad,'' McCovey said. ``But not as
sad as if they were tearing it down. As long as the 49ers play
there, I know I can drive up the Bayshore Freeway and see
Candlestick right there.''
</P>
<P>
   With memories intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the exception of Seals Stadium, all my memories are of
Candlestick,'' McCovey said. ``But it's funny. I always thought
that we should be playing downtown. Even early on, I thought it was
a mistake to build a park so far from the city. With Seals Stadium,
I liked the idea of office people taking a break and coming down
and watching the Giants. But we settled at Candlestick and made the
best of it.''
</P>
<P>
   At least McCovey did. When the curtain closes on Candlestick
following the Dodger series, McCovey will be the stadium's all-time
leader in home runs (236), RBIs (698), hits (925), games (1,085)
and at-bats (3,369).
</P>
<P>
   It's one reason he's regarded as the most popular San Francisco
Giant. Willie Mays and others had played in New York, but McCovey
was San Francisco's very own, beginning in the city, ending in the
city and enjoying a Hall of Fame career in the city.
</P>
<P>
   During his years away from the team, McCovey was sentenced to
two years probation and fined $5,000 by the federal government in
1996 for tax evasion on unreported card-show income, though he says
now the experience was ``more positive than negative. So many
people, from the mayor on down, rallied behind me. I don't think it
was as big of an issue as it was in the newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   McCovey's biggest setback, of course, has been his knees. He had
trouble late in his career but blames ``ill-advised surgeries'' for
his recent woes. He said procedures designed to help actually hurt,
and artificial replacements were inserted. But a staph infection
has developed, requiring doctors to remove a replacement. After six
to eight weeks, they'll redo the replacement.
</P>
<P>
   McCovey said he pushed back his next surgery to early October so
he could attend the Candlestick functions. He also was voted by
fans to the all-time San Francisco Giants team, which will be
honored at Sunday's game.

   WEBHEALTH _ In the hyperkinetic universe of Internet companies,
health care sites may be the fastest-rising stars. Young startups
such as Austin's Drkoop.com and healthanswers.com are fighting to
be your doctor's office on the Web and grab a share of the $1
trillion Americans spend on health care every year. They are
drawing hoards of money and the endorsement of some of the most
trusted names in medicine. But how useful are these sites?
Consider: They are mostly run by people who don't have medical
training. They offer frequent disclaimers urging that you seek a

   DELL-EXPANDING _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Dell Computer Corp. is
reinventing itself right before our eyes. No longer statisfied to
be just a PC maker _ with profit margins shrinking and the U.S.

an agreement that will make IBM Global Services a strategic
provider of computer-related services to Dell customers. (Mahoney,

   WEBHEALTH _ In the hyperkinetic universe of Internet companies,
health care sites may be the fastest-rising stars. Young startups
such as Austin's Drkoop.com and healthanswers.com are fighting to
be your doctor's office on the Web and grab a share of the $1
trillion Americans spend on health care every year. They are
drawing hoards of money and the endorsement of some of the most
trusted names in medicine. But how useful are these sites?
Consider: They are mostly run by people who don't have medical
training. They offer frequent disclaimers urging that you seek a
doctor's advice if you have questions about a medical condition.
Most of them offer the same warehouses of well-known, general
information on diseases, first aid and prevention. Wire stories and
press releases from General Mills and Gatorade are presented as
``medical news,'' and fluffy stories on herbal remedies and keeping
cool in the summer abound. And in chat rooms and support groups,

   VOLS-CHEATING _ Saturday's 17-16 near loss to Memphis appears to
be the least of Tennessee's problems. A seven-week investigation by

   HKN-THRASHERS _ The new overtime rules in the NHL should be a

Four-on-four gives the edge to teams with a lot of skilled

four-on-four in hopes of having more games decided in the
five-minute sudden-death period, rather than remain tied. (Schultz,

HISTORY, FAITH EMERGE IN NUANCED PORTRAIT OF THE POPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for time and channel.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once, Karol Wojtyla seemed the perfectly modern pope. He zipped
through cities in his ``Popemobile.'' He skied. He played stadiums.
He welcomed rock stars to the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frontline'' quickly dispels that old pop pope business Tuesday
night. In time, it also nicks the contrary notion that John Paul II
is hidebound and angry in his confrontation with modernity.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Whitney, the producer who sought meaning in the lives of
Bill Clinton and Bob Dole for the award-winning ``The Choice'' TV
biographies in 1996, puts the pope under the same sort of
microscope in ``John Paul II: The Millennial Pope.'' She finds him
tough to pigeonhole.
</P>
<P>
   She finds too that John Paul II is Polish. Very Polish.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't a facile conclusion. Over two hours, Whitney shows just
how deeply his nationality affects the pope and the Roman Catholic
Church. It's Poland's blanket of melancholy. The palpable presence
of mysticism and faith. The Polish church's sanction of
anti-Semitism, which stung the future pope. The totalitarian double
whammy of Nazism and communism.
</P>
<P>
   Whitney sees these themes revealing themselves in John Paul II's
rapprochement with Judaism, in his suppression of ``liberation
theology'' as too chummy with Marxism in Latin America, and in his
opposition to contraception, abortion and capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   She also seeks roots for the pope's fervent devotion to the
Virgin Mary, and for his refusal to accept the ordination of women
as priests. The suggestion here is that after the death of his
mother when he was a boy, the future pope transferred his feelings
for her to the Virgin Mary _ and to what Mary represents about the
function of women.
</P>
<P>
   ``He deeply believes, in a way that I think is simply difficult
for the modern sensibility to grasp, in the reality of the Virgin
Mary,'' says Tony Judt, a New York University professor. ``This
makes him peculiarly sensitive to what he thinks of as the crossing
over of roles ...''
</P>
<P>
   The documentary is remarkable for Whitney's ability to find the
right person with the right quote at the right point in the
program.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``The Millennial Pope'' may be too much of a slog for any
viewer who isn't rabidly interested in the subject. That is, until
it soars heavenward in the final 30 minutes or so.
</P>
<P>
   Whitney seems to step out from behind a biographical program and
addresses John Paul II's powerful faith. In fact, ``The Millennial
Pope'' suddenly becomes a paean to religious faith, period, and one
of the most extraordinary segments of TV programming I've ever
seen.
</P>
<P>
   With deep feeling and uncommon articulateness, four people talk
about the experience of the divine. Or about the quest for it.
They're physicist David Berlinski, feminist writer Germaine Greer,
singer Andrea Marcovicci and Romanian priest Raymond Braga, who was
imprisoned for 11 years by the Communists.
</P>
<P>
   A show that was thoughtful and good, if pokey and limited in
viewer appeal, abruptly transforms itself into something else
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost like witnessing a miracle. Can you find that
anywhere else on your TV tonight?

THE NEW OAKLAND RAIDERS ARE EQUAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY RATTO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Lance Johnstone was asked if he could have
seen any of his previous Raider teams committing five turnovers and
nine penalties and winning. It didn't take him long to dismiss the
notion as madness.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' the Raider defensive end said almost dismissively. ``But
this is a different team.''
</P>
<P>
   That much, we established a week ago. The Raiders showed what
they can do in Minneapolis last week. Sunday, against the far more
mundane Chicago Bears, they showed what they must do.
</P>
<P>
   Namely, win a game they seemed hell-bent on losing.
</P>
<P>
   True, we speak here of the Bears, who for all their newfangled
looks play pretty much as the same old Bears have, which is to say
ineffectively. For all the pregame yap about the new Chicago
offense with its hurried tempo and extravagant formations, it is
still a team with no discernible running game (Curtis Enis? Please)
and a practiced inability to keep the officials happy (17
penalties, including seven holding calls, one by the marvelously
named Warrick Holdman).
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, a really good NFL team would have beaten this Chicago
team half-stupid. The Raiders are not a really good NFL team, but
as we look at today's standings, we find that there are no really
good NFL teams out there, making the Raiders anyone's equal for the
first time in years.
</P>
<P>
   In short, these Raiders are not the old Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can compare this team to previous years,''
linebacker Greg Biekert said. ``To 1995, or '96, or whatever you
want to do. There just aren't a lot of guys left from back then.
There have been a lot of changes here, players, and character.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, if the choice is whether this was a win by virtue of
talent or a win by virtue of character, you'd be better off taking
option (b). This was, after all, a win based on defense, and the
Raider defense has carried this team long enough to be considered
its spine, and therefore its character.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears and their fancy-schmancy new offense managed two
concerted drives all afternoon, and each of them resulted in a
missed field goal by the strangely unpopular former Raider, Jeff
Jaeger. The two Chicago touchdowns came as a result of two former
Stanfordites _ a 92-yard kickoff return by Bear Glyn Milburn in the
first quarter, and Raider Darrien Gordon's fumble on a punt return
in the third.
</P>
<P>
   The old Raider defenders might have thrown up their hands (or
worse, just thrown up) and prepared themselves for another tour
through football hell, let down by the underdeveloped half of the
depth chart.
</P>
<P>
   The new Raiders didn't give it a thought. Indeed, they were more
annoyed with the Bears and their attempts to bluff a victory they
plainly hadn't the skill to achieve on their own.
</P>
<P>
   We turn now to defensive tackle Darrell Russell, who thought the
Bears far more talky than walky, especially Enis.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're a professional, so act like it,'' Russell said of Enis,
who carried 15 times for 35 yards and had no impact on the day.
``He's talking all the time, pushing people in pileups, and I
finally just had enough. We were walking up the tunnel, and I told
him, `I want you to run the ball more. I want you to run it at
me.'''
</P>
<P>
   We'd like to report that Enis did just that, but frankly,
watching him carry the ball is too tedious an exercise to analyze
in any depth. If he did run at Russell, good on his father. If not,
well, who cares?
</P>
<P>
   ``Talking like that, it's just something I don't respect,''
Russell said, the contempt staining his shirt. ``It's just not
called for.''
</P>
<P>
   The other Bears were more circumspect, but not much more
enlightening. Even the much-vaunted hurry-up offense with all the
pretty formations yielded the same plays every other team runs,
only not quite as well.
</P>
<P>
   Safety Eric Turner dismissed it as ``window dressing . . . they
didn't do anything we hadn't practiced against all week.''
</P>
<P>
   It showed. The Bears lost 1 yard in total offense in the fourth
quarter, which is hardly the way to close out what under normal
circumstances would be a very winnable game. The NFL keeps
statistics on a team's record when turning the ball five times, and
while the numbers are not readily available to us, it is believed
to be a galactically horrible figure.
</P>
<P>
   And, at least in this case, irrelevant. The Oakland Raiders, the
team with the spine-snapping schedule, the limited offense and the
proud decade of non-achievement, are tied for the AFC West lead,
and have a two-game edge on the defending Super Bowl champion
Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone figured on that,'' Biekert said with a
laugh. ``But I think that's something for when we play them (in two
weeks). It's not something we need concern ourselves with right
now.''

DOLE FAILS TO IGNITE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Presidential candidate Elizabeth Dole likes to
tell the story of a young girl, maybe 10 or 11, who came up to her
recently with a complaint: ``But I wanted to be the first woman
president,'' the girl said, worried that Dole would steal her
dream.
</P>
<P>
   Some political strategists and Republican Party insiders say the
young girl may have nothing to worry about. Dole is coasting, they
say, when she really needs to be snapping at the heels of
front-runner George W. Bush, taking advantage of favorable poll
numbers and making bolder statements about policy and national
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she doesn't do it soon, the momentum will fade and her
ability to do so will diminish,'' Ed Gillespie, a Republican
strategist, said recently. ``She's going to lose the chance to
strike while the iron is hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole attended the California Republican Party convention on
Saturday in Anaheim, delivering a campaign speech and mingling with
the party faithful. She told a few jokes, spoke about cracking down
on drug smuggling, about the proliferation of pornography in public
libraries and about a general decline in values as the country
grows more prosperous.
</P>
<P>
   But her half-hour speech contained many elements the same party
faithful had heard her say word-for-word at their last meeting,
including a long story about riding a motorcycle with Jay Leno.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike Bush, the Texas governor, and Sen. John McCain of
Arizona, Dole has been virtually invisible in vote-rich California,
except to Republican insiders.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates at the weekend convention said Dole doesn't really
stand much of a chance against the well-funded Bush campaign, which
has collected $52 million in contributions and could easily take in
an unprecedented $75 million before the primaries begin early next
year. The brief campaign stop in Anaheim didn't convince everyone
Dole was ready for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a canned speech that was very low on specifics,'' said
Adam Sparks, chairman of the San Francisco Republican Assembly.
``She was entertaining and she certainly had that talk-show
quality. She'd probably make a good talk-show host. But we're sort
of in the 11th hour and we want to know where she stands.''
</P>
<P>
   Sparks said the party appears ready to back Bush, even if he
thinks Dole, Steve Forbes or McCain may be qualified candidates
with good ideas. ``I think the Republicans in this state have been
so beat up after the big defeat in '96, they are going to ride any
train out of Dodge.''
</P>
<P>
   Others liked Dole's style, but weren't so sure she could make it
the whole way. Gale J. Enderlin, who attended the convention from
Castro Valley, said of Dole: ``I'm still thinking of her as a
running mate.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole, the former president of the American Red Cross and a
member of the Cabinet in the Reagan administration, said she would
return to California for two days in early October and is raising
money in the state.

 &HT;    READ OF THE WEEK: Eating Disorders
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ ``When You Eat at the Refrigerator, Pull Up a Chair'' by
Geneen Roth. Hyperion. 1998. $15.95 hardback.
</P>
<P>
   This petite volume of 50 tips aimed at helping people cope with
compulsive eating might conceivably blend in with all the other
petite self-help books crowding bookstore shelves these days. Pick
this one up, whether or not you know what it's like to consume an
entire half-gallon of ice cream in a single sitting and then hate
yourself for it. Roth's sixth book includes suggestions such as
``Be willing to lose the suffering contest'' and ``Begin to gently
let go of friends who don't want the best for you,'' which apply to
a much broader audience than just those who struggle with their
weight or feelings toward food. Part of Roth's appeal is that she
doesn't advocate any particular eating plan or diet method; on the
contrary, the book's first tip is, ``Whatever you do, don't diet.''
She reminds readers to eat enough protein but adds that how much is
``enough'' varies from person to person; she stumps for a daily hot
meal but doesn't stipulate when or how large it should be.

   _ ``Surviving an Eating Disorder: Strategies for Family and
Friends'' by Michele Siegel, Ph.D., Judith Brisman, Ph.D. and
Margot Weinshel, M.S.W. HarperPerennial. 1997. $13 paperback.
</P>
<P>
   This book is an excellent resource for those affected by the
eating disorder of a friend or family member. It provides a basic
overview of the symptoms of anorexia, bulimia and binge eating, as
well as suggestions on how to deal with people with disordered
eating.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Eating Disorder Sourcebook'' by Carolyn Costin, M.A.,
M.Ed., M.F.C.C. Lowell House. 1997. $17 paperback.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat clinically written but extremely informative, this book
describes eating disorder symptoms in detail and outlines treatment
approaches, including individual therapy, medication and
hospitalization. Those with eating disorders as well as their
relatives and friends will find this book helpful in telling them
what to expect from treatment.

 &HT;    Q and A with Geneen Roth
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Compulsive eating expert Geneen Roth will host a
workshop Oct. 8-9 at the Atlanta Airport Hilton. ``The New Breaking
Free,'' an updated version of her popular ``Breaking Free''
workshops, focuses on the emotional reasons behind compulsive
eating.
</P>
<P>
   Roth, 48, battled anorexia and compulsive eating in her teens
and 20s. At 28, she stopped trying to diet and instead began
searching for the emotional roots of her relationship with food.
</P>
<P>
   She has since published several best-selling books, including
``Feeding the Hungry Heart'' and ``When Food Is Love.'' Her latest
book, ``When You Eat at the Refrigerator, Pull Up a Chair,'' offers
esteem-boosting suggestions for people battling poor self-image and
eating problems.
</P>
<P>
   Roth, who lives in Northern California, spoke recently with The
Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Compulsive eating doesn't seem to get as much attention as
bulimia and anorexia, even though obesity is a national epidemic.
Why do you think that's the case?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think (anorexia and bulimia) are more dramatic, and in some
cases more urgent. But what I call emotional eating, the
run-of-the-mill dieter who binges, is just as much if not a bigger
problem. It doesn't get addressed very much.
</P>
<P>
   The sad part is, many, many people are in pain about their size.
They're putting their lives on hold until they get thin.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can one overcome compulsive eating?
</P>
<P>
   A: Absolutely and without a doubt. I think I am a perfect
example. I was a tortured, crazed being. There is nothing that
people can tell me they've done with food that I haven't done. I
never thought I would spend a day in my life where I wasn't
obsessed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I can't even remember the last time I binged or overate. It
is an amazing thing.
</P>
<P>
   My basic message is that you don't have to suffer with this for
the rest of your life. In order not to suffer with it, it's
important to see that it's both a physical and an emotional
process.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You emphasize that people should eat when they're hungry, and
stop when they're full. It seems like common sense, but you mention
that people have reacted angrily to this suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   A: People were furious with me. They thought it was just another
fad diet. We're so accustomed to these fad diets, and people are so
removed from that initial and instinctive reason to eat, that when
someone says to tune into your hunger, it sounds like another diet.

 &HT;    Fast facts about the new inhaled flu drug
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Friday, Relenza will be available for sale by prescription in
U.S. pharmacies. Relenza, also known as zanamivir, is the first
anti-viral drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
to treat both major strains of influenza.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a substitute for a flu shot. Relenza has not been
approved for preventing the flu, although a recent study shows that
the drug can greatly reduce your chances of catching the flu from
another household member. Glaxo Wellcome, Relenza's manufacturer,
plans to seek FDA approval for preventative uses of the drug by the
end of the year. Until then, a flu shot remains the best defense
against the illness.
</P>
<P>
   People with flu symptoms should begin taking Relenza within the
first two days after symptoms start. The drug is taken twice daily
for five days and reduces the duration of sickness by an average of
1 1/2 days.
</P>
<P>
   Relenza is inhaled through a plastic inhaler device called a
Diskhaler. The device holds a disc-shaped blister package
containing a powder mixture of Relenza and lactose. When the disc
is loaded into the inhaler, the blister is punctured. The user
inhales the released powder.
</P>
<P>
   People with asthma or chronic heart or lung disease should
consult their doctors before taking Relenza. Relenza's wholesale
cost for a five-day treatment course is $37.
</P>
<P>
   Another anti-flu drug, Tamiflu, probably will be approved soon.
Tamiflu will be available in pill form, also for flu treatment but
not prevention.

 &HT;    `Once and Again' team tackles angst of divorce, dating
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   They're at it again: Ed Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz are back
digging into baby boomer family life _ or what's left of it. Just
as the writer-producer team did with ``thirtysomething'' and ``My
So-Called Life,'' Zwick and Herskovitz have created a drama that
heads to the heart of baggage-heavy lives _ this time of
40-somethings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once and Again,'' which debuted last Tuesday, stars Sela Ward
and Billy Campbell as divorced parents in their 40s who fall in
love again _ a complicated enterprise with teens and exes around.
It's airing in the coveted ``NYPD Blue'' time slot, where it will
stay until ``Blue'' returns in November. ``Once and Again'' is then
scheduled to go on hiatus until January, when it slips into the
slot vacated by ``Monday Night Football.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a complicated arrangement that shows ABC's excitement in
airing the drama as soon as possible (last week's premiere had the
highest ranking among viewers 18 to 49 of any network's premiering
drama in four years), and its frustration in finding it a perfect,
permanent home in an era when news magazines rule. The drama also
repeats Friday nights at 11 on Lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Zwick, 46, and Herskovitz, 47 _ friends since film school _ sat
with us recently on a crowded veranda at the Ritz Carlton hotel in
Pasadena, Calif., and did what they do best: talk.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A lot of people in their 40s have the same reaction to ``Once
and Again'' that they had in their 30s to ``thirtysomething'': You
have a camera trailing my life?
</P>
<P>
   Zwick: It's about a willingness to look inward and try to make a
very scary leap that what you see will not only be understood by
you, but by many others. It's coming to understand that one's own
experience is not singular, but universal.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is this show a 40-something version of ``thirtysomething''?
</P>
<P>
   Herskovitz: ``thirtysomething'' came out of our concerns and
interests, this show came out of our concerns and interests, so of
course there can be some similarity.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You guys have tapped into the psyche of baby boomers the way
Pottery Barn tapped into their tastes...
</P>
<P>
   Zwick: He's calling us the Pottery Barn of TV! How do you feel
about that, Marshall?
</P>
<P>
   Herskovitz: I like to think we're the Restoration Hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is this a particularly interesting generation to dramatize?
</P>
<P>
   Zwick: We're a much more self-conscious culture _ you had the
president talking about his marriage. It's the legacy of so many
things _ leisure time, money, social opportunity. So it is more
verbal and self-conscious, and in that way we're only reflecting
the time in which we live. Q: How was the idea for the series born?
</P>
<P>
   Herskovitz: It had been running around our lives and brains for
years _ it's almost impossible to spot when it was born, and I was
there. We're always talking about the aspects of life you can
dramatize. That's what we do every day.
</P>
<P>
   Q: ``thirtysomething'' was criticized by some viewers as ``too
real.''
</P>
<P>
   Herskovitz: After the pilot of ``thirtysomething,'' my best
friend from high school called and said, ``I am so sorry. I just
found out that show I turned off last week after 10 minutes because
I turned to my wife and said, `I'm living this, why do I have to
watch it on TV?' turned out to be your show.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will that happen with ``Once and Again''?
</P>
<P>
   Zwick: We'll see. What better opportunity: You got them
(viewers) in the house, alone in the dark _ it's too ripe.
</P>
<P>
   Herskovitz: We felt when we started to do ``thirtysomething''
the paradox was TV is so intimate, and yet usually not emotional.
We gave a lot of time to what were the ways we could draw someone
in to the experience of the show.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How?
</P>
<P>
   Herskovitz: There's the craft we learned in film school, the
craft that the great classical directors used, starting in the
'20s, what we call generosity. Giving gifts to the audience of
being entertaining.

   Zwick: Gifts of perspective, humor, unexpected turns.
</P>
<P>
   Herskovitz: In ``It's a Wonderful Life,'' in the scene near the
end where Jimmy Stewart is in despair and he's come home after the
$5,000 is missing and he's throwing things in his house and
screaming at his kids, and the little boy follows him around,
tugging at his leg, going, ``'scuse me, 'scuse me,'' and Jimmy
Stewart finally goes, ``What!'' And the kid goes, ``I burped.'' Why
put that in there? Because it's what life is.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What traits define baby boomers?
</P>
<P>
   Zwick: There are two rivers. One is the river of writers,
comedians, monologuists, that voice of the internal monologue of
novels, the stream of consciousness. The other river is therapy.
Therapy has had an effect on a generational voice. It presumes to
say that the examined life is worth living.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How much has therapy effected your work?
</P>
<P>
   Herskovitz: It's deeply imbedded in our world view. In my
family, my mother and brother are therapists. I believe in it
philosophically. I believe in the romantic illusion that we can
change and grow.

 &HT;    The alter-Garth: What's it all about, anyway?
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's going to be a hard sell.
</P>
<P>
   Garth Brooks' much-hyped pop CD as the fictional rock star Chris
Gaines, arrives in stores today, reintroducing the country
superstar to the world as a pop artist. It's followed by a week
packed with ceaseless promotion, from a prime-time concert on NBC
to a series of talk show couches where Brooks will no doubt explain
(and explain and explain) what the project is all about.
</P>
<P>
   In the CD and television special, however, Brooks' alter ego
turns out to be a bit of a letdown, an adult-contemporary performer
with lots of energy but little spark in his material. Even with
studio wizard Don Was (Bonnie Raitt, the Rolling Stones) at the
boards, Brooks-as-Gaines seems like a passionless version of Kenny
Loggins, alternating between forgettable acoustic ballads and
charged-up rock anthems.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks' distinctive voice is intact, but even the
million-selling pipes can't keep ``Gaines'' from sounding
contrived. Perhaps that's because it is. By adopting an alter ego,
creating a fictionalized bio and then writing a greatest hits
package to span two decades of changing style and music forms,
Brooks has approached his leap over the country fence like an
assembly line draftsman.
</P>
<P>
   The companion NBC television special (8 p.m. Wednesday), in
which the country star performs the new material in a live-on-tape
concert, has a little more soul simply because Brooks is so
bizarrely fired up about Gaines. We hear not only the songs, but
are invited into an elaborate and detailed fantasy world. There are
video clips of a 15-year-old Gaines (played by an actor) performing
an early hit with the band Crush. At one point, Garth, wearing dark
shirttails over black jeans (sans hat), even flips a finger into
the camera only to quickly apologize, saying ``That wasn't me doing
that; it was Chris.''
</P>
<P>
   As you follow the story, keep in mind that the character of
Chris Gaines comes from a movie, ``The Lamb,'' that has yet to be
written. The project might have made much more sense if it had been
a soundtrack, for at least we could connect to a plot. But with no
film to support the premise, it gets weird and out-of-touch.
</P>
<P>
   What's even stranger is that Brooks has already proven to be a
passionate, provocative rocker. One of his biggest hits,
``Shameless,'' was penned by Billy Joel. ``Ain't Going Down 'Til
the Sun Comes Up'' is better arena rock than anything by Chris
Gaines. The only tune that even remotely rattles around the brain
is ``Right Now,'' where Brooks lays down walkie-talkie rap protest
about guns and parents over Buffalo Springfield's classic '60s
tune.
</P>
<P>
   Should Brooks be condemned for working outside the country box?
No. But his transition should have come more naturally than this.
Let the music do the talking, Garth, not the publicity machine.

'TIS THE SEASON FOR LAKE TAHOE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM STIENSTRA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH LAKE TAHOE, Calif. _ Every hotel room in town has been
full on weekends for months at South Lake Tahoe, the roads jammed,
with some of the drivers certifiable lunatics.
</P>
<P>
   But from Angora Peak, looking down across cobalt-blue Lake
Tahoe, circled by miles of forest and the granite mountain rim, it
can seem as if you are the only person on earth.
</P>
<P>
   Yet only a few miles separates these two universes.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the sterling beauty, gambling and nearby recreation,
especially driving tours, hiking, biking, golf and boating, Tahoe
is approaching Yosemite and Disneyland as the regional two-day
vacation of choice. For months on end, there have been so many
people here that it resembles feeding time at the zoo.
</P>
<P>
   But with the first cool nights just starting to arrive here and
so many in the Bay Area and Sacramento paying more attention to the
49ers and work rather than Tahoe and play, the best time of year to
venture out here is now at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Though autumn is still more than a month off in the Bay Area,
it's arrival is imminent at Tahoe. The aspens are just about to
start turning color, with full color likely within two weeks and
temperatures expected to drop into the 30s at night for the first
time of the season. The cool mornings give a pristine feel to go
with the long-distance views, then give way to Indian summer days
in the 70s.
</P>
<P>
   From South Lake Tahoe, it is only a short drive to the best
launching point to take it all in.
</P>
<P>
   From the Y, as they call it here, the intersection of U.S. 50
and Highway 89, it is only a few miles north on Highway 89 to
Fallen Leaf Lake Road. From here you turn left, then take the
narrow, often-bumpy two-laner up along the ridge (follow the signs
at two turns), past a fire lookout and to a small parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   It is only a half-mile walk to Angora Lake, one of the prettiest
easy-to-reach lakes anywhere in the Sierra. It is set at 7,400
feet, nestled in a small granite bowl backed by a dramatic high
wall. The water is clear, fresh and pristine.
</P>
<P>
   It is only a start. There is a small resort here with eight
cabins available for rent, complete with a 10-year waiting list,
where folks who have signed up make a few prayers each year for
cancellations. That operation closed last weekend. For those who
desire less traffic in a beautiful setting, it is just what they
have been waiting for.
</P>
<P>
   The swimming here is best described as ``refreshing,'' that is,
the water is not warm, yet not yet frigid. For all partaking, it is
cold enough to activate distinct anatomical changes. The swim is
best taken after exploring the area, by foot or bike, on a warm
afternoon. By bike, there is a network of excellent mountain bike
trails below Lower Angora Lake, as well as near-flat bike routes
near Fallen Leaf Lake (another parking lot is available directly
off Fallen Leaf Lake Road).
</P>
<P>
   But the best of adventure and views comes for the enterprising
few who make the climb to Angora Peak, 8,588 feet elevation,
overlooking the entire Tahoe Basin. From the shore of Angora Lake,
there is a route that follows the ridge above the lake in a
counter-clockwise direction, with a few steep spots, a few
scrambles, with a 1,150-foot climb over the course of about a mile.
</P>
<P>
   As you clear the trees, the expanse of Tahoe suddenly comes into
view, the Lake in the Sky. Directly below is little Angora Lake,
small, round and glowing, and beyond is Fallen Leaf Lake, Emerald
Bay and the giant cobalt-blue Tahoe, edged by a tourmaline tint
along its southern shore. The sweeping beauty is simply
eye-popping.
</P>
<P>
   Because of forest, most of the development and roads are
well-hidden from view, and other than the distant white streaks of
power boats at Tahoe and perhaps a few jumping swimmers at Angora,
it feels as if you have the place to yourself.
</P>
<P>
   To get this experience, I used to think you had to make the
butt-kicking, six-mile, 6,500-foot climb to the top of Mount Tallac
(9,735 feet). Nope. Tallac is very special, but the view here is
similar, just as breathtaking. Note that Angora Peak is not quite
atop the Sierra crest. Beyond to the west across a few miles of
sculpted granite is the crest, topped by Echo Peak at 8,895 feet.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, I have wondered how the Tahoe experience could
be improved. How can the divine beauty and recreation be guaranteed
into the forever? Yet without having to fight off the crowds to get
it, especially the encounters with the handful of maniac drivers?
The best suggestion is that perhaps the entire Tahoe Basin could
become a national park, without barring any of the current industry
and development, with an entrance fee charged to pay to keep Tahoe
blue, and provide for stellar recreation opportunities.
</P>
<P>

P.O. Box 8897, South Lake Tahoe, CA 96158; For a map of Eldorado
National Forest, send $4 to Maps, Forest Service, 1323 Club Drive,

   50 year-old ``''Peanuts'''' still worth devouring
</P>
<P>
   By Gary Schwan
</P>
<P>
   C. 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ What is the perfect ``Peanuts'' comic
strip?
</P>
<P>
   Charles Schulz has an opinion. He's allowed, since he created
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was drawing a strip where Linus is sitting under a tree, and
he's got his blanket,'' Schulz said from his studio-office in Santa
Rosa, Calif. ``Snoopy's cuddling up under the blanket with him.
Linus says he doesn't remember inviting him _ `but I have to admit
you are kind of warm and fuzzy.'
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it was the perfect punch line,'' Schulz added.
``Everybody brings something to the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Through his gentle, all-too-human comedy, Schulz has brought the
world to the ``Peanuts'' party for half a century. The world-wide
anniversary celebration is being kicked off at the International
Museum of Cartoon Art in Boca Raton, Fla., on Saturday with ``50
Years of ``Peanuts: The Art of Charles M. Schulz,'' which runs
until Jan. 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peanuts'' has been ``explained'' by everyone from Christian
evangelists to the brainy semiologist Umberto Eco, who loves the
strip he once translated for Italian newspapers. He calls Schulz a
Poet, with a capital P. The artist, a notoriously modest man, seems
largely unaffected by the musings of the intelligentsia.
</P>
<P>
   But he's passionate about the perils of ``growing up.'' He talks
as if he knows first-hand the sort of insecurities and anxieties
that Charlie Brown and his pals often display.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a kid is not easy,'' he said. ``It's a fearful world out
there, and the playground is a dangerous place. Going to school
every day is not easy. If it isn't the teacher, it's the bully.
Most adults forget about these struggles, and ignore the problems
little kids have. As an adult, you learn how to get around these
problems and how to survive. But little kids are struggling with
that survival.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulz said he's ``always accused of putting adult things in
kids' mouths. But they come up with the most remarkable statements.
I just give a slight exaggeration to what is real life.''
</P>
<P>
   The first strip, from Oct. 2, 1950, had a rather _ good grief! _
snarky tone: Two kids, Shermy and Patty, watch a smiling Charlie
Brown stroll down the street. ``Good ol' Charlie Brown . . . Yes
sir,'' Shermy says. ``Good ol' Charlie Brown . . . How I hate
him!''
</P>
<P>
   ``That first strip is the only one Sparky wishes he could take
back,'' laughed Brian Walker, using Schulz's childhood nickname,
taken from the horse Spark Plug in the comic strip ``Barney
Google.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker, son of ``Beetle Bailey'' cartoonist Mort Walker, has
known Schulz for years and curated the exhibition at the cartoon
museum. (When the museum began raising money for its Mizner Park
building, Schulz became the largest private donor, plunking down $1
million. The 76-year-old cartoonist won't attend the show. ``Only
because I have no interest in visiting Florida.'')
</P>
<P>
   Although not a retrospective, the show will have a ``timeline''
tracing ``Peanuts''' impact on popular culture _ from the first
strip, to the 1999 Broadway revival of ``You're A Good Man, Charlie
Brown,'' which won two Tony awards. There will be artifacts,
posters, toys, dolls and blow-ups of historic strips.
</P>
<P>
   A second section will feature original art and comic strips. A
third will be a sculptural re-creation of the world of ``Peanuts''.
Visitors will encounter life-size characters. They can visit Lucy
at her psychiatry booth, or spot Linus in the pumpkin patch with
his security blanket. ``With cartoons, a cultural context should be
addressed,'' said Walker. ``A comic strip hanging on the wall with
a light on it is meaningless to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Christina Orr-Cahall, director of the Norton Museum of Art,
worked closely with Schulz on a ``Peanuts'' exhibition at the
Oakland (Calif.) Museum and marvels at his output. ``He's very
self-effacing, very modest,'' she recalled. ``He doesn't see
himself as an artist, which I would disagree with. He has never
really lost his working class roots.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Walker: ``Despite the riches and worldwide acclaim, he's
still the same awkward kid that he probably was when he was
young.'' (But not the real-life Charlie Brown. Schulz's hero was
modeled after a boyhood friend.)
</P>
<P>
   Schulz simply calls himself a cartoonist _ a rare one who still
creates the entire strip, from the gag to the drawing to the
lettering. He's known as a stickler for quality control, but he
sounds rather nonchalant about the workload.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cartooning is just something you do,'' he said. ``It's just
something I always wanted to do. I'm not obsessed by traveling. I'm
not obsessed by getting everything done in this lifetime. I draw
comic strips for the same reason people do watercolors, or go
bowling. I love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in St. Paul, Minnesota in 1922, Schulz used to discuss
comic strips over breakfast with his beloved father, a barber. ``I
always drew, but I didn't know it was possible to be a cartoonist
until my teens,'' he recalled. ``When I began professionally, the
only vague ambition I had was to do a comic strip as good as
(George Herriman's) 'Krazy Kat'.''
</P>
<P>
   During his senior year in high school, Schulz enrolled in a
correspondence course in cartooning. After serving with the Army in
Europe during World War II, he returned to St. Paul and got a job
as a letterer for a Catholic comic magazine. In 1947, his panel
cartoon ``Li'l Folks,'' the forerunner of ``Peanuts,'' appeared in
the St. Paul Pioneer-Press. It ran for nearly three years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, Schulz hand-carried some strips based on L'il Folks to
United Feature Syndicate in New York. The syndicate snapped them
up, renaming the strip ``Peanuts'' because of copyright
considerations.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz couldn't come up with a name for the new strip, and
thought ``Peanuts'' sounded ``dumb. I was afraid people would think
that 'Peanuts' was the name of the lead character. I'd never heard
of kids being called 'Peanuts.' I had to give in, of course. ``
</P>
<P>
   ``Peanuts'' debuted in seven newspapers. Today, it appears in
more than 2,600 newspapers in 75 countries. The ``Peanuts''
franchise generates $1 billion a year in retail sales alone. Each
year, more than 20,000 new products appear bearing ``Peanuts''
character art. There are some 800 licensees throughout the world.
One out of every five Hallmark greeting cards sold has a
``Peanuts'' theme.
</P>
<P>
   And every item must pass Schulz's inspection. In between, he
also finds some time for cartooning. ``The strip is not what you
would call a chore. I work on one strip at a time, seven days a
week. Finishing three a day is pretty good for me. Two kind of
empty. One very empty. I've never done more than six a day a half
dozen times in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulz freely acknowledges that his once precise drawing style
has become scratchier over the years. ``It's age. Simple as that.
Sometimes I have to prop one hand in the other. Some days it's
worse than others.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulz said the ``Peanuts'' strip will die with him. ``I can
quote my daughter, Amy. We were meeting with lawyers and such, and
she said, `I don't want anyone drawing Daddy's strip.' ''
</P>
<P>
   There's a practical consideration, as well. ``Another artist
might be able to duplicate it _ bring the strip up to the level it
is now. But he wouldn't be able to take the strip forward,'' Schulz
said. ``This is an extremely personal medium. A comic strip
shouldn't just lay there. It should always advance.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Schulz isn't going anywhere. He plays center for a
hockey team in the annual seniors tournament that he hosts each
year at the beloved ice arena he built for the community of Santa
Rosa. Shulz's day usually begins with coffee and an English muffin
at the arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see kids skating in the morning. It's a nice, pleasant way
to start the day.''
</P>
<P>
   He then walks to his office a few blocks away, reads the papers
and works until about 11:30. Then it's lunch back at the arena,
talking to the locals. His workday ends around 4 p.m. Lately, he's
been doing his Sunday strips at home. Schulz has five children from
a previous marriage. His second wife, Jeannie, has two.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz said the day-to-day grind isn't a problem. ``The most
difficult part of cartooning is finding a theme around which you
can do variations,'' he said. ``The Red Baron. Charlie Brown losing
the ballgame. The Great Pumpkin.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulz avoids becoming too ``deep'' when talking about his
famous characters. For example, what would the ``Peanuts'' gang be
like if they ever grew up? ``People have been trying to force me to
think about that for a long time, but I wouldn't have the slightest
idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Schulz calls himself politically concerned, politics
rarely, if ever, appears in his strips. ``Political humor is too
easy,'' he said. Causes do show up on occasion. For example, Schulz
once did a series of strips on the ``lazy eye'' medical problem in
children. And ``Peanuts'' was an advocate for Title IX _ women's
equality in sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``His cartoons had a lot to do with making that happen,'' said
the Norton's Orr-Cahall. ``He could bring the issue into everyone's
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulz is generous in praise of younger cartoonists. Two of his
favorite strips are Patrick McDonald's ``Mutts'' because ``it's
just funny, that's all. The writing is funny, the drawing is funny,
and he's not trying to save the world.'' He also admires Mark
Tonra's ``Top of the World.'' ``It's about two funny guys in
prison, and I like the stylized drawing.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Schulz's drawing style may have changed over the past
15 years, its virtues remain the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sparky has an uncanny ability to tap into the emotions that
other people leave behind,'' said Brian Walker. ``By varying those
lines and the position of the eyes, he can make a character happy,
wistful, sad _ all those subtle emotions from those simple lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker compares Schulz to Mark Twain.
</P>
<P>
   ``His contributions to American culture are just as significant
as Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn. He created Charlie Brown and Snoopy.
This show may remind us how much they've become a part of our
collective consciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   BOX
</P>
<P>
   If the ``Peanuts'' gang grew up, we wondered how they would be
spending their modern maturity years:
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Brown: Now on his second marriage (after that fling with
``the little red-haired girl''), he works as assistant manager for

 &HT;    Braves still feel there's something to prove with MetsBy Thomas
Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York _ With the heavy-lifting finished, the NL East champion
Braves have just two reasons for breaking a sweat in the season's
last week.
</P>
<P>
   First, by going 4-2 over the last six games, Atlanta can assure
itself of the best record in the league and assume home-field
advantage in the first two rounds of the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the Braves get another chance to trash the New York
Mets.
</P>
<P>
   And don't underestimate inspiration No. 2. They won't admit to
it publicly, but the Braves' relationship with the Mets has
darkened. Atlanta's current dominant status, 14-4 the past two
seasons, spiced with New York charges that Chipper Jones was tipped
off on pitches last week, has made for hard feelings. With the Mets
reeling in a six-game collapse, the three-game series beginning
tonight offers the Braves a chance to make an uncomfortable
situation nastier.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to protect the integrity of the baseball,'' Jones
said. ``When we take the field, we're going to try to win. What
nine players are going to do it? I don't know. But if I take the
field in New York, I'm not going out there to tune up for the
playoffs. I'm going out there to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people expect us to take the last week off, they're badly
mistaken.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets caused some of that attitude with the tipping charges.
But as with almost every other team in the league, Mets manager
Bobby Valentine has managed to inspire an opponent by his mere
haughty presence. In some ways, the Mets' swoon is the worst in the
franchise's 38-year history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say it can't get any worse,'' catcher Mike
Piazza said. ``I really don't want to say that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves would not mind contributing to their troubles. The
club was incensed about the charges against Jones, who has hit .448
with seven homers and 14 RBIs in nine games against the Mets.
Valentine has become a lightning rod for the Atlanta response.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say those things sounds like you're crying,'' right fielder
Brian Jordan said. ``His job is on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been a weird few days for the Mets manager, who over the
weekend pledged that the Mets would make the playoffs or management
should replace him. Mets co-owner Fred Wilpon had to shoot that one
down personally, leaving Valentine to return to his recurring chirp
that the team's bad luck is bound to change.
</P>
<P>
   With Cincinnati beating St. Louis on Monday, New York enters
play today 1 1/2 games out of playoff contention. When Philadelphia
completed last weekend's sweep over the Mets, the P.A. system at
Veterans Stadium blared ``Taps.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mets are still in it,'' Braves manager Bobby Cox said.
``You can't go up there and just lie down. We'll go as hard as we
can.''

   KOSOVO-ARRESTS (Mitrovica, Kosovo) _ Twenty-six men from one

since Serb police forced them out from their apartments and
separated them from their wives and children in the street below.
On Monday, their relatives were called to the main police station
here and were told by French gendarmes of the men's fate. It seems
that minutes after the women and children were ordered to flee on
that terrible day, April 14, the men were all executed. The news
brought to an end the families' long search for their menfolk, and
a conclusion to the extensive three-month investigation by the
French. The case is seen as a first in Kosovo where foreign
investigators have conducted a complete investigation, working from
the first reports of missing people to finding a mass grave and
arresting suspects. By Carlotta Gall.

LONDON SUBWAY MAP LEADS TO CONFUSION ABOVE GROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN FLINN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ It's all Harry Beck's fault. On my recent visit to
London I realized, once again, that I still don't have the foggiest
idea where anything is. I have absolutely no clue whether
Westminster Abbey is within walking distance of Piccadilly Circus
or whether Covent Garden is east or west of Trafalgar Square or
whether Soho is close to Big Ben or not.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the London I know isn't the London of clock
towers and double-decker buses and leafy green parks. The London I
know is an alternative, underground London, with its own
idiosyncratic coordinates and geography. The London I know is the
London of Harry Beck.
</P>
<P>
   One of the underappreciated geniuses of this century, Beck was
an unemployed draftsman who devised the London Underground map in
1931 (for which he was paid the sum of five guineas.) In a leap of
transcendent brilliance, Beck realized that as long as he put all
the tube stations and transfer points in the correct sequence,
scale didn't matter at all. He was free to expand the crowded city
center and shrink the outlying suburbs and bend and stretch lines
this way and that, so they all ran horizontally, vertically or
diagonally. The result was a schematic diagram so intuitive and
easy to read that it is still in use, with updates, today.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't make the mistake of confusing it with above-ground
London.
</P>
<P>
   When I'm in London I ride the Underground everywhere, popping up
here and there like a gopher blinking in the harsh sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this, I have absolutely no spatial orientation of the
city.
</P>
<P>
   As Bill Bryson pointed out in ``Notes From a Small Island,'' an
out-of-town visitor using Beck's map to get from, say, Bank Station
to Mansion House would quite understandably board a Central Line
train to Liverpool Street, transfer to the Circle Line and continue
for another five stops to Mansion House _ and emerge 200 yards down
the street from where he started.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it's easy to make the mistake, as I once did,
of assuming that Hounslow West and Hatton Cross must be quite close
to one another, because they're cheek-by-jowl in Beck's London.
Twenty minutes into my trek I realized my error and backtracked to
the tube station.
</P>
<P>
   The other problem with Beck's alternative London is that the
station names are so enchanting and fanciful that above-ground
London, beguiling as it may be, can never live up to their
suggestion. As you rumble through the dark, dank bowels of the
city, your mind conjures up the fairy-tale world of Elephant &AMP;
Castle, Swiss Cottage, Chalk Farm and Pudding Mill Lane.
</P>
<P>
   Some stations seem to be echoes of long-ago London: Shepherd's
Bush. Parson's Green. West India Quay. Mudchute. West Ham. Others
sound straight out of a P.G. Wodehouse novel: Finchley Road &AMP;
Frognat, Chorleywood, Ickenham. Tooting Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   It goes without saying that the world above these underground
stations seems sadly mundane compared to your fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   But the underground stations, built like Victorian catacombs,
are fascinating worlds unto themselves. They're peopled with
world-class musicians cheerfully ignoring the ``No Busking'' signs
and decorated with advertising posters displaying dry British wit.
A sign on a candy machine said: ``Cadbury's chocolate inside.
Please remain calm.''
</P>
<P>
   A billboard for the London Dungeon museum proclaimed: ``Now
worse than ever!''
</P>
<P>
   On my next visit perhaps I'll give myself over completely to
Beck's London, riding the Piccadilly Line from Hammersmith to
Cockfosters, or the Metropolitan Line out to Harrow-on-the-Hill and
back, never emerging into the sunlight of above-ground London.

<P>
   Solid scientific information about herbal medicine is difficult
to find in this country, since federal law classifies herbs as food
supplements, not drugs. In Germany, by contrast, a government

   When the Pathfinder mission beamed images from the surface of
Mars two years ago, Yogi, Stimpy and Flat Top were among the stars
of the show. They were not characters in some Three Stooges remake;
they were rocks at the landing site, and the mission's
remote-controlled rover spent a lot of time photographing, X-raying
and otherwise examining them.
</P>
<P>
   The three rocks and others are back in the limelight, the
subject of new studies by scientists from NASA's Johnson Space
Center in Houston. Poring over Pathfinder photos, the scientists
have found evidence that impacts from small objects from space may
be altering rocks on Mars.
</P>
<P>
   Such landscaping occurs on the moon, where there is no
atmosphere to burn up objects and thus every Tom, Dick or Harry of
a meteor _ even specks of dust _ helps sculpt the surface. But the
thin atmosphere of Mars, by burning up the smallest objects, was
thought to have limited those that get through to ones that would
make a crater of about a yard in diameter or larger.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists, writing in Science, observed an impact crater of
about a quarter of a yard in diameter on Stimpy. As for Yogi, they
suggest that it too was hit by something that decapitated it. And
Flat Top got that way, they say, from a similar collision. In these
cases, the colliding object had to be small, or else the rocks
would have been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, wind and water were thought to be largely
responsible for shaping the Martian landscape. But the scientists
say that the Pathfinder evidence points strongly to small
extraterrestrial impacts as having a role.
</P>
<P>
   Dangers for Birds
</P>
<P>
   It may be an open question whether modern communications
technology is changing peoples' lives for the better, but there is
little doubt that birds are worse off. All those towers for
cellular telephones, television and radio are potential killers.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, as presented last month at a meeting of the
American Ornithological Union at Cornell University, is
particularly acute in bad weather at night, when birds are
attracted by tower lights. One of the worst incidents occurred on a
snowy night in January 1998 in western Kansas, when about 10,000
migrating birds died at the site of a television tower. Some hit
the tower directly, but others became disoriented and circled,
eventually hitting guy wires or dying from exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon is not new, the ornithologists say, but with the
increase in the number of towers in recent years it appears to be
growing worse. Of particular concern, they say, are digital
television towers, which can easily reach 1,000 feet and which are
just beginning to be built around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Some steps can be taken, however. In Canada, a power company
found that bird kills at generating station smokestacks were cut
significantly when spotlights were replaced by flashing strobes.
</P>
<P>
   The Iceberg Cometh
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have had their first close encounter with a giant
iceberg that is adrift off Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   The iceberg, about 48 miles long and 24 miles wide, is a remnant
of one that calved off the Thwaites ice tongue into the Amundsen
Sea in West Antarctica nearly a decade ago. (And quite a fatted
calf it was: It was originally more than 100 miles long.)
</P>
<P>
   The iceberg was locked in pack ice for several years, then split
into two pieces in 1995, and it is the larger piece, named B-10A,
that is being tracked.
</P>
<P>
   A National Science Foundation research ship encountered the
iceberg earlier this month, taking photographs, sizing it up with
radar and collecting ice samples. At a speed of 10 knots, the ship
took 12 hours to circumnavigate it.
</P>
<P>
   B-10A will eventually go the way of all icebergs, but because it
is so large there may be enough left as it drifts into warmer
waters to pose a threat to shipping around Cape Horn, the
southernmost tip of South America.

 &HT;    Funk, rubber eyewear and a $2 million dress
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILAN, Italy _ Punk and funk collided Sunday when designers
Domenico Dolce and Stephano Gabbana presented looks from their
spring/summer bridge collection, D&AMP;G. Their models, outfitted
frequently in garb embellished by chains, crucifixes and safety
pins, strutted to a soundtrack of rap diva Missy Elliott.
</P>
<P>
   It was a show of decadence and extravagance. The D&AMP;G skirts were
tiny enough to be mistaken for belts. Eyelets made the leather
goods that much lustier, and pinstriped blazers were paired with
stretch lace leggings. The runway space adjacent to Dolce &AMP;
Gabbana's inner-city villa was decorated to look like a tropical
retreat: a good setting for the animal-, floral- and postcard-print
separates.
</P>
<P>
   As if that weren't enough to chew on, the designers also
announced the launching of two new D&AMP;G licenses: a rubberized
eyewear collection called Gum, and a chewing gum brand by the same
name (which tastes like Juicy Fruit in designer wrapping). Both
should reach stores by month's end.
</P>
<P>
   Wedded bliss: If Antonio D'Amico learned anything during his
long love affair with the late designer Gianni Versace, it's that
fashion is as much about theatrics as anything. So, for his show
that brought the first day of Milan's Fashion Week to a close,
D'Amico rented space at the Teatro Des Artes and capped off his
spring/summer show with a wedding dress that even the richest women
can only dream about.
</P>
<P>
   The white satin gown, with an asymmetrical zipper running up the
front, was festooned with 350 diamonds weighing a total of 140
carats. Its $2 million price tag makes it the most expensive
garment ever manufactured in Italy. (The queen of Belgium
reportedly is interested in buying or borrowing it.) After spending
a respectable length of time mourning Versace, D'Amico, who
formerly co-designed the lower-priced Versus collections, opened
his own firm last year. His latest warm-weather collection is sleek
and simple _ a stark departure from the ostentatious looks for
which Versace was renowned.
</P>
<P>
   A prairie home companion: While some designers sketched their
collections with jet-set or space age clienteles in mind, Alberta
Ferretti brought her Philosphie line down to earth. Her
handkerchief-headed models wore clothes the color of moss, grass,
dirt, wildflowers and spent dandelions. Except for ruffles around
the necks, sleeves and hemlines, Ferretti's frocks were mainly
fuss-free. Pristine cottons, crocheted knits, ginghams, suedes and
leathers were her key fabrics. To drive home the modern-milkmaid
mind-set, models were outfitted in knee-high mud boots.
</P>
<P>
   High karate: New York-based designer John Bartlett always has
fanciful females in mind for inspiration. Backstage Monday, after
showing his collection for the Milanese label Byblos, Bartlett said
his muses are ``Jackie Kennedy on acid,'' ``Western geishas'' and
``Judy Jetson at the prom.'' Virginal white dresses, suits and
separates _ all sheer, slit at the hems and asymmetrically wrapped
_ started off the show. They were followed by black-and-gold
ensembles, souped up with jet beading. Then Bartlett showed Asiatic
satin ensembles in pastel colors. Key details included martial arts
belts encircling coats, blouses and dresses, and origami folds of
fabric on his skirts.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrity sighting: R&AMP;B diva Mary J. Blige was at Sunday
afternoon's D&AMP;G preview, in exceedingly tight red leather and
close-cropped hair.

EARTHQUAKES: A MATTER OF LUCK, MOST OF IT BAD

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The doom mongers are wrong, scientists say. The killer
earthquakes that have shaken the globe in the last month and taken
thousands of lives in Turkey, Greece and now Taiwan are no sign
that the end is nigh.
</P>
<P>
   By all estimates, the number of large jolts around the globe is
below average this year, and it is simply bad luck that the recent
upheavals have ripped through populated areas, leveling thousands
of buildings and leaving tens of thousands of people dead, missing
or homeless.
</P>
<P>
   But more bad luck is coming, experts agree. Even though the rate
of earthquakes over time seems to be more or less unchanging, the
world's population explosion means that more people are moving into
quake zones, which are often near coasts. The result, experts say,
is the prospect of continuing trauma as urban areas erupt with what
seems like nearly endless bursts of destruction.
</P>
<P>
   A million people have died in earthquakes this century, experts
say. The next century might see 10 times as many deaths, with a
million lost in a single blow, they add, unless major steps are
taken to fortify dozens of sprawling cities that are expected to
teem with billions more residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is inevitable,'' said Klaus Jacob, an earthquake expert at
Lamont-Doherty, the earth sciences research center of Columbia
University. ``More and more people, and more and more buildings,
are at stake. As the world gets more populous and richer, allowing
a more built-up environment, higher buildings and all the
infrastructure that supports our civilization, communications and
the like, the risk goes up.''
</P>
<P>
   John Boatwright, a geophysicist at the U.S. Geological Survey in
Menlo Park, Calif., agreed. ``In many places in the world, we've
been building up infrastructure like crazy,'' he said. ``We have to
regard ourselves as really lucky'' and the rash of recent tragedies
as warnings of trouble ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Bilham, an earthquake expert at the University of Colorado
now at Oxford University on a Guggenheim fellowship to study the
rising urban risk, said the next quarter-century might see three
``megacities'' hit hard, with 3 million lives lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's quite possible,'' he said, adding that disasters of
such biblical dimensions might finally prod the world to get
serious about quake-resistant structures. ``That will be the
spur.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Press, author of ``Understanding Earth'' (Freeman, 1998)
and a past president of the National Academy of Sciences, said
Tokyo was one of the biggest worries, given its global financial
importance and history of devastating quakes. One in 1923 took
143,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
   He said a future blow to the Tokyo area, now home to more than
10 million people, might ``damage the world economy,'' setting off
a downward spiral in advanced and developing nations. Press added
that the Bank of Tokyo has quietly studied the likely cost of such
an upheaval to Japan and the world, and concluded that it would be
dire.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations is accelerating studies of the urban
earthquake hazard as part of its global effort to help stem the
toll of natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, given the growing danger to cities, experts say that
the earth's dynamism, including its volcanoes and earthquakes,
restless plates and splintering rocks, is essential to making the
planet habitable. For life in general and humans in particular,
they add, the overall benefits far outweigh the risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``A planet without plate tectonics is dead,'' said Press, who as
President Jimmy Carter's science adviser helped spur the United
States' program to explore other worlds.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the earth alive geologically is the slow release from
its interior of heat, which fires out molten rock as volcanoes and
pushes a dozen or so huge crustal plates into one another, causing
rocks to break apart in earthquakes. As in most rocky bodies of the
solar system, the planet's heat arises mainly from the slamming
together eons ago of its rocky components and the radioactive decay
of such elements as uranium, potassium and thorium.
</P>
<P>
   This heat forces the earth's plates to move like conveyor belts,
recycling millions of tons of crust each day. New plate material is
ejected volcanically at long mid-ocean ridges. From there it
spreads out across the ocean floor and is eventually destroyed
hundreds or thousands of miles away as the cooling slab collides
with and then sinks beneath other plates, plunging headlong back
into the hot earth.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, scientists say, all this action has helped produce
the oceans, the atmosphere, the continents and fertile dirt, making
the planet remarkably lush.
</P>
<P>
   Does the solar system harbor hints of similar dynamism? Are
there extraterrestrial quakes?
</P>
<P>
   The Apollo astronauts found the moon to be geologically dead.
Its small size, which makes for a large surface area relative to
its mass, was judged as having let its interior heat radiate into
space long ago.
</P>
<P>
   But now scientists are looking closely at Mars and several of
Jupiter's moons, which are squeezed and probably heated by enormous
tidal forces from the giant planet. Such places are seen as likely
candidates for quakes and possibly life thriving in warm, dark,
alien ecosystems down below inhospitable surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Torrence Johnson of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.,
said planetary scientists were drawing up plans to land quake
sensors on such remote bodies, adding that similar dreams had gone
unfulfilled for decades and might be sidetracked again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's embarrassing,'' he said. ``We have a good qualitative
view of what happened'' in the early days of the solar system but
few details about its current state of geological activity.
</P>
<P>
   On earth, the action can be disastrous when square miles of
homes and buildings are erected near the borders of the ambulatory
slabs of crust that make up the planet's surface and slowly grind
past one another about as fast as fingernails grow. These seams are
the world's main quake zones, producing the vast majority of jolts.
</P>
<P>
   Over the ages, the collision and separation of plates has
produced the continents and their coastlines. The invisible seams
are often nearby and potentially deadly for cities. California's
famed San Andreas fault, for instance, is part of the larger
process whereby the Pacific plate inches past the North American
plate, keeping the Golden State jumping and Angelenos edgy. The
whole Pacific is ringed by analogous seams.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan is near the border of the Philippine and Eurasian plates,
ensuring a long history of upsets. Last week's quake had more than
1,000 aftershocks and took at least 2,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of earthquakes occur around the globe every day,
though most are small and only a few strike cities.
</P>
<P>
   Waverly Person, director of the National Earthquake Information
Center, in Golden, Colo., an arm of the U.S. Geological Survey,
said historical records showed that the shaking of the earth was in
a relative lull now, despite the apparent rash of recent upsets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people say these quakes are a sign that the earth is
ending,'' Person said. ``Well, the earth has been coming to an end
for a long time.''

 UNDATED: long time.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite the lull, experts say the dangers will rise as more
people inhabit cities near coasts and quake belts. Today, a third
of the earth's population lives within 60 miles of a coast, experts
say, and that fraction is expected to grow, increasing their
vulnerability to both earthquakes and hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   Bilham of the University of Colorado wrote a pioneering paper on
the rising quake hazard that was published in the journal Nature in
1988 and he has explored the field ever since. He said that the
world currently has 27 megacities, which the United Nations defines
as holding at least 8 million people, and that more than a third of
these dense urban regions were located near quivering plate
boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   The major cities at risk, he said, in addition to Los Angeles,
Tokyo and Taipei, the capital of Taiwan, include Athens, Greece;
Istanbul, Turkey; Tehran, the capital of Iran; Islamabad, the
capital of Pakistan; Calcutta, India; Jakarta, Indonesia; and
Manila, the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The probability of any one megacity being hit is quite low,''
Bilham noted. ``But if you take a plate boundary that has 10
cities, then the probability increases and I would not be surprised
if one of those went quite soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Seih, a seismic expert at the California Institute of
Technology, said the overall risk was rising. ``There are a lot of
big cities around the world that are going to be eaten in the
coming century,'' he said, ``unless we pay better attention'' to
erecting stronger homes and buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``These earthquakes in the last year of the millennium are going
to be an interesting test,'' Seih added. ``Do we go on with
business as usual, and fatalistically accept that we're going to
lose tens of thousands of people a year? Or do we say, `No, we have
the know-how to survive more completely'?''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had just returned from Turkey, where he had examined
a jumble of devastated buildings. ``A lot that collapsed were
new,'' he said, noting that many deaths occurred in such buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Both Turkey and Taiwan have building codes similar to
California's, which are meant to let people get out alive in a
major earthquake even if a structure is seriously damaged.
Protective measures include reinforcing concrete walls and pillars,
digging deep foundations and adding special joints to ease internal
stresses on buildings that suddenly start to shake and sway.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the codes are better enforced in Taiwan than in
Turkey. That discrepancy, they say, added to the size of the
Turkish disaster, which killed more than 15,000 people, and perhaps
as many as twice that number. The total is unclear because of the
slow recovery from the ruin.
</P>
<P>
   Bilham of the University of Colorado, who recently returned to
his sabbatical at Oxford from inspection trips to Turkey and
Greece, said he was optimistic for the new century because so many
new buildings would be constructed that in theory would be much
stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's buildings that kill people,'' Bilham, a geophysicist,
said, ``not earthquakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Retrofitting to modern earthquake standards is very expensive,
he said, costing upward of half a building's value. But in new
construction, quake precautions add just 10 percent to 20 percent
to building costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the good news is that if we come to grips with the reality
that earthquakes will keep hitting planet earth, and acknowledge a
certain future of shaking in cities, then we'll build buildings
that don't fall down,'' Bilham said. ``By acting now, we can save a
lot of lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, he added, is that developing countries, which have
the greatest need of safeguards, are often mired in economic
conflicts exacerbated by exploding populations. For instance, in
one part of India, he said, planners faced a choice of whether to
erect 150 buildings that were quake-resistant or 200 that were not.
</P>
<P>
   ``They built 200,'' Bilham noted. ``That's the kind of decision
that's going on around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In time, he added, probably after a series of urban disasters,
and surely by the year 3000, ``I'd be very surprised if we don't
build buildings that don't fall down.''

THE PATIENT'S NOT CRAZY, JUST LITERATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(lb) 
 By ERICA GOODE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before your next hospital stay, you might want to ponder a
question raised in last week's New England Journal of Medicine: Do
the doctors and nurses on staff know their literature?
</P>
<P>
   Not medical literature. Just literature, of the type studied in
English classes.
</P>
<P>
   A letter to the journal described the case of a 51-year-old high
school teacher who entered the hospital for treatment after a heart
attack. Surrounded by tubes, wires and machines, the patient
remarked that he felt as if he were ``in Peter Coffin's inn.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Coffin was the proprietor of Spouter-Inn, the lodging
house in Herman Melville's 1851 novel, ``Moby-Dick,'' where Ishmael
had to share a bed with the magnificently tattooed Queequeg.
</P>
<P>
   The nurse, however, heard the word ``coffin,'' and immediately
called in psychiatric consultants, who interviewed the patient for
several hours to determine if he was suicidal. He was not.
</P>
<P>
   No one at the hospital ``seemed to recognize the reference to
`Moby-Dick,''' lamented Dr. Howard Fischer of Detroit in the letter
to the journal. ``No one had read the novel.''
</P>
<P>
   Fischer concluded that two lessons could learned from the case.
``Medical personnel,'' he wrote, ``need to listen more closely to
patients' remarks and ask about unfamiliar phrases.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Second (and less readily changed),'' Fischer continued,
``physicians and nurses need a broader education in the
humanities.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, one can imagine other misunderstandings that
might occur when medical personnel are deficient in literary
expertise. In the course of having his blood drawn, for example, a
patient might say: ``Though I am not splenetive and rash / Yet have
I in me something dangerous'' (``Hamlet,'' Act V, Scene One), and
be whisked off to see an oncologist.
</P>
<P>
   Or a patient might borrow a line from ``Henry VI'': ``The first
thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers,'' sending hospital
administrators into an uproar.
</P>
<P>
   And what about the man who opines: ``I grow old, I grow old, I
shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled'' (T.S. Eliot)? Should
he consult a geriatrician?

IN THE ETHICS STORM OVER HUMAN EMBRYO RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Tenn., N.Y.)   (af)  
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE _ On the white paper tablecloth, Brigid Hogan is
sketching a diagram with the children's Crayolas the restaurant has
thoughtfully provided. The daughter of two artists, she draws
rapidly and precisely. The structure of an embryonic lung billows
out across the table.
</P>
<P>
   Words like ``sprouty,'' ``breathless,'' ``branchless,'' playful
names for the genes that control the process, appear alongside
arrows and curlicues.
</P>
<P>
   Watching this gentle English biologist reach for another
Crayola, it is hard to believe she could ever occasion a threat,
let alone one Congress has deemed so severe that it has thrice
passed a law to thwart it.
</P>
<P>
   A leading expert on the embryology of the mouse, Dr. Hogan was
the scientific co-chairwoman and principal author of a National
Institutes of Health report on human embryo research. The report,
published in 1994, presciently described the benefits to be
expected from the study of embryonic stem cells, the primordial
human cells that were first isolated last November, and it said
biologists should be allowed to derive the cells from the surplus
embryos created in fertility clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Some biologists hope the cells will provide a universal repair
kit for human tissues.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of destroying human embryos, even surplus ones, was
daring enough, but the report went on to recommend letting embryos
be created by mixing eggs and sperm in a dish, a procedure that
could help treat infertility.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton swiftly repudiated the notion of creating
human embryos for research purposes. And Congress was so perturbed
by the report that for the last three years it has specifically
forbidden the National Institutes of Health to pay for any research
in which a human embryo is destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The agency now believes it can legally finance researchers to
use the cells, though not to derive them, under rules recommended
by a group of experts, including Dr. Hogan. The guidelines are
expected to be issued imminently but abortion opponents hope to
have Congress override them.
</P>
<P>
   A clash of competing values was perhaps inevitable as biologists
started to part the veils around the mystery of life's earliest
moments. The report by Dr. Hogan and her colleagues, who included
ethicists as well as biologists, precipitated the maelstrom because
it was a ringing scientists' manifesto, a public declaration of the
various types of human embryo research that were about to become
technically feasible and the medical benefits to be expected from
each.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Hogan works at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in
Nashville and holds a coveted fellowship from the Howard Hughes
Medical Institute, a munificent patron of biomedical researchers.
</P>
<P>
   In her office overlooking a graceful courtyard on the Vanderbilt
campus, she seems far removed from the political fray set off by
her panel's report.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a tremendous shame that people funded by the
National Institutes of Health cannot work on embryonic stem
cells,'' she said. But she has no present plans to do so herself.
Apart from one foray into human embryology, an attempt to derive
stem cells from fetuses, her chief interest has always lain with
the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   As a scientist, her purpose is to understand how embryos
develop. For the most part, that requires manipulations that would
be unacceptable with human embryos. But, because people seems to be
constructed with a very similar set of genes, research by mouse
embryologists like Dr. Hogan is laying the groundwork for
understanding and repairing the many human imperfections caused by
defects in the embryo-shaping genes.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Hogan's interests in embryos are esthetic as well as
practical. Ever since she was a girl growing up near High Wycombe,
a town 28 miles northwest of London, she has viewed embryos as
things of particular beauty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I carry a picture of a mouse embryo in my wallet to look at if
I'm feeling low, like people carry pictures of their family,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She studied biochemistry at Cambridge University and did
postdoctoral work at Massachusetts Institute of Technology on sea
urchins. But the genetics of sea urchins are not well understood,
and besides, she said, ``You don't feel that warmly about the sea
urchin embryo.'' On returning to England, Dr. Hogan switched to the
mouse, which was then becoming easier to study because of new
advances.
</P>
<P>
   Although scientists are supposed to be able to reproduce
another's work by following the recipes given in published
articles, there are often details of technique that never get
written down. Dr. Hogan soon realized that there was a whole body
of arcane lore, known only to specialists, about how to mate mice
and manipulate their embryos.
</P>
<P>
   During a meeting at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New
York City, a leading teaching center for biologists, she mentioned
to its director at the time, James Watson, the idea of holding a
course there to teach researchers how to do mouse embryology.
</P>
<P>
   Watson abruptly left the table where they had been talking,
leaving her to wonder what she could have said to offend him. But a
few minutes later, the time necessary to visit his business office,
Watson returned, saying, ``It's all organized.'' Dr. Hogan began
teaching a summer course, now in its 16th year.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Watson's enthusiasm was not mirrored by the National Institute
of Medical Research in London, where she then worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Cold Spring Harbor, everything is organized to get things
done,'' she said. ``In the NIMR, people thought you were a nuisance
if you asked for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   During Christmas vacation, the institute's building was closed
for two weeks, and those who wanted to work had to bring in their
own heaters. Dr. Hogan recalled how her ankles would burn while the
rest of her shivered. She decided one Christmas Eve that she
couldn't be competitive in such circumstances. Writing round to
friends, she heard of a job at Vanderbilt, where she moved in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   With a group of 11 people, including graduate and postdoctoral
students, she is trying to reverse-engineer the mouse by analysing
the genetic program that guides its development from an egg. Mouse
researchers now have many powerful techniques at their disposal.
</P>
<P>
   They can remove a gene, creating a strain of `knock-out' mice
that by their physiological defects may reveal what the gene is
meant to do. Or they can replace the gene with one that makes a
blue stain that shows when and in which tissues the gene is active.
</P>
<P>
   With colleagues at Vanderbilt and elsewhere, Dr. Hogan has found
that a particular gene, known as BMP-4, must be switched on if the
embryo is to set aside germ cells for the next generation of mice.
She is also studying the development of organs like the lung and
the lens of the eye.
</P>
<P>
   Both require interactions between cells belonging to two of the
three sheets of tissue of which the early embyro is formed. These
interactions are governed by specific genes, whose roles she is
trying to define.
</P>
<P>
   Though she focuses on the mouse, Dr. Hogan is keenly interested
in how the techniques she and colleagues have developed may be
applied in medicine. Now that human embryonic stem cells have been
isolated, they allow human embryos to be manipulated with the same
mastery as mouse embryos, although of course most of the changes
made to mouse embryos would be ethically unacceptable with humans.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Hogan agrees with researchers who believe that human
embryonic stem cells are likely to be useful in repairing ordinary
tissues in adults or in a fetus. But she opposes the use of altered
embryonic stem cells to make changes to an individual's germ line,
as is done routinely in making knock-out mice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the technique is far too risky and is unlikely to ever
be perfected to the stage when it is absolutely 100 percent
reliable, which is what one would have to insist on,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at a dual-eyepiece microscope, Ray Dunn, one of Dr.
Hogan's graduate students, shows a visitor the magical moment when
the mouse embryo changes from a blob to a being. Up to six days
after fertilization, the embryo is a tiny white opalescent
cylinder, still far more like an egg than an animal.
</P>
<P>
   But by the eighth day it has billowed out into a tier of buds
and whorls, visibly destined to form head, heart, limbs and tail.
Human embryos look much the same, though they have a more
flattened-out appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Though embryologists are far from being able to understand how a
mouse or human is put together, the problem does not seem
insoluble. Five families of signaling genes, many used over and
over again at different stages of development, seem to control a
major part of the mouse embryo's development.
</P>
<P>
   When all the developmental genes and their functions are known
and entered in the databases, won't the mystery of life be
dispelled and its awe destroyed? Dr. Hogan doesn't think so.
</P>
<P>
   The embryo, she said, ``is to me the most beautiful thing in the
world, quite exquisitely beautiful, and the idea that one could
eventually describe how it is formed and grows just in terms of
molecules and genes and pathways doesn't detract from the beauty at
all, makes it more awesome, in fact.''

   Flight of the Monarchs
</P>
<P>
   Q. In mid-September, I saw many monarch butterflies headed south
down Sixth Avenue in Manhattan. Is this unusual? Do they congregate
around New York City somewhere?
</P>
<P>
   A. This is the right time of year for the Eastern monarchs'
migration, and they do congregate in Cape May, N.J., by the
thousands.
</P>
<P>
   The monarchs seen in and around New York City are flying through
on the way to their wintering sites in the mountains of central
Mexico, according to the Monarch Project, a clearinghouse for
information on their migration. The butterflies seek out
microclimates congenial to an overnight rest and are off again in
the morning.
</P>
<P>
   The migration happens every year, but is much more noticeable in
some years because insect populations are highly variable. Factors
like wind patterns may influence the exact route. However, each
year there are reports of sightings in Manhattan, even of big
groups flying by office windows 30 floors up.
</P>
<P>
   The Eastern population of monarchs overwinters in the
Transvolcanic Range in Mexico, on the border of the states of
Michoacan and Mexico. The site, 10,000 feet above sea level, was
discovered in 1975. The Western population overwinters on the coast
of California.
</P>
<P>
   General information on the monarchs' migration and their
overwintering sites, but not on their specific travel plans, is
available from the Monarch Program at (760) 944-7113.

   When you hear hoofbeats, don't think of zebras.
</P>
<P>
   To doctors, the axiom is a call to focus on common ailments and
not waste time on the exotic. But on those rare occasions when they
do detect a zebra, doctors say they need to take extra steps in
their investigation to make sure they have identified the right
one.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point is the encephalitis outbreak that is blamed for
at least three deaths in New York City. Earlier this month, the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta and the New
York City Health Department said the cause was the mosquito-borne
St. Louis virus, which had never been identified in New York City
before.
</P>
<P>
   But last weekend the CDC, responding to findings from laboratory
tests performed by Dr. Tracey McNamara, a pathologist at the Bronx
Zoo, announced that the outbreak was caused by an even rarer zebra:
the West Nile virus from Africa. Dr. W. Ian Lipkin, of the Emerging
Diseases Laboratory at the University of California at Irvine,
confirmed the findings.
</P>
<P>
   The viruses are closely related, causing virtually the same type
of inflammation of the brain. But the West Nile virus had never
before been detected in the Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``CDC would not have made the diagnosis of West Nile virus as
quickly without Dr. McNamara's persistent medical sleuthing,'' Dr.
Duane J. Gubler, the head of CDC's arbovirus field station in Fort
Collins, Colo., said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The change in diagnosis, though not important in terms of the
spraying and other public health measures taken to combat the
outbreak, was scientifically embarrassing to the CDC, the premier
federal agency that is responsible for tracking infectious diseases
in this country.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, CDC and other health officials have led a
campaign against the threat of new and emerging infections, warning
doctors to expect more infectious disease ``zebras,'' like the
sudden appearance of old microbes in new areas.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, health officials thought they had scored a coup when
they diagnosed the mysterious illness as the St. Louis virus. The
disease is usually found in the Southeastern states, and humans are
usually bystanders in such infections. Birds are the principal
reservoir for the arboviruses, but they do not become sick.
Instead, mosquitoes transmit the viruses to people who may become
ill.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, the concurrent deaths of an unusual number of
birds in the city has turned out to be an important but
underestimated clue. Federal and local medical sleuths did not
immediately relate the bird die-off to the human outbreak because
West Nile, St. Louis and similar encephalitis viruses generally do
not kill birds.
</P>
<P>
   Now the CDC is retesting blood and spinal fluid from patients
who had symptoms of encephalitis and who did not show evidence of
St. Louis virus.
</P>
<P>
   The new findings mean that health workers need to investigate a
number of other possibilities, Gubler said.
</P>
<P>
   A critical one is that the CDC can no longer be certain that the
West Nile virus has never been present in the United States,
because federal scientists never specifically checked for it in
earlier outbreaks and individual cases. In testing mosquitoes and
specimens from humans with encephalitis, CDC routinely checks all
types of viral encephalitis known to have caused infection in the
Western Hemisphere, Gubler said.
</P>
<P>
   There can be considerable overlap in findings from the
laboratory tests unless extra steps are taken to distinguish
between the many types of encephalitis-causing arboviruses. In a
sense they are all one virus, but with many variations that can be
detected in the laboratory. The encephalitis they cause is the same
disease, although there can be subtle differences in the type of
brain damage they produce.
</P>
<P>
   The viruses occur in different geographic areas, and by
scientific custom they are named for the area where they were
discovered. They include Murray Valley encephalitis in Australia,
Japanese encephalitis, and Rocio virus in Brazil and Argentina.
They are distinguished in the laboratory by small differences in
the proteins in the covering of the virus known as its envelope.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't include West Nile, Japanese and other encephalitis
viruses because they have never been known to be here,'' Gubler
said, adding that in the New York outbreak, ``we had tunnel vision
on St. Louis virus, because all the clinical, epidemiological,
laboratory and geographic features pointed to St. Louis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've learned a lesson here,'' Gubler continued. ``We've got
to be more open-minded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we get past this crisis, we are going to have to go back
and check specimens from CDC and state health departments to see if
it has been here, and if so, for how long.''
</P>
<P>
   The West Nile virus was discovered in 1937 in Uganda. Since then
``it has rarely reared its head,'' Gubler said, though outbreaks
and occasional cases have been reported from Israel, France,
Romania and elsewhere in Europe. Presumably the virus was carried
northward by birds migrating from Africa.
</P>
<P>
   After a nearly two-decade silence, West Nile virus caused a
large outbreak in Romania in 1996. This year West Nile virus
apparently caused illness among humans in Volgograd, Russia, though
Gubler said he had received no reply to an inquiry he has made to
Russian scientists about the outbreak. Lack of communication among
scientists thwarts efforts to learn why a virus is spreading.
</P>
<P>
   When birds began dying in and near the Bronx Zoo, McNamara, the
pathologist there, initially thought they might be due to viruses
that cause avian influenza, Newcastle disease, fowl cholera or
Eastern equine encephalitis, Gubler said.
</P>
<P>
   McNamara sent the specimens to the Department of Agriculture
Laboratory at Ames, Iowa, where scientists eliminated those
candidates as the cause. Because the Ames laboratory lacked the
material to test for the pertinent arboviruses, they forwarded the
specimens to CDC, Gubler said.
</P>
<P>
   Gubler said scientists also needed to investigate whether the
deaths of the birds indicated that West Nile virus had become more
virulent.
</P>
<P>
   The virus has been shown to stay in the blood of humans longer
than other types of encephalitis virus, so that mosquitoes are more
likely to pick up and transmit it to other humans. But whether such
transmissions occur on a regular basis is not known, Gubler said.
</P>
<P>
   A main focus will be to prevent a recurrence of the outbreak in
New York next summer. Scientists do not know whether the virus can
persist in infected mosquitoes while they hibernate over the
winter, Gubler said. In the absence of definitive information,
health officials will consider the need to begin control of storm
drains to decrease the probability of infected mosquitoes'
surviving the winter.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When Dr. Yehuda Ben-Zion visited Turkey three days after the
recent earthquake there, he saw the deadly capriciousness that is
familiar to survivors of such cataclysms. The dividing line between
a seemingly untouched building and a pile of rubble might be no
more than a few yards wide, said Ben-Zion, a seismologist and
geophysicist at the University of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could find a house that was destroyed standing next to a
house that is not,'' Ben-Zion said. Similar stories were told by
survivors of last week's earthquake in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   What looks like the skipping finger of fate can partly be
explained by a combination of mundane factors like variations in
construction quality and fault lines in the underlying rock. But
increasingly, scientists like Ben-Zion are finding those factors
inadequate in explaining the spotty nature of the destruction and
are making an effort to understand why the seismic fury of an
earthquake is focused on one spot and not another.
</P>
<P>
   Hints are turning up in simple laboratory experiments in which
containers of granular materials like sand, beads, powders, poppy
seeds and even peanuts are shaken, vibrated or otherwise agitated.
Vibrating a shallow dish containing sand or beads, for example,
does not simply spread particles randomly.
</P>
<P>
   Under certain conditions, the vibration produces rising and
falling bumps called oscillons and moving structures that resemble
``little Loch Ness monsters,'' said Jay Fineberg, a physicist at
The Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel. Fineberg and other
scientists suspect _ although they still cannot prove _ that
something similar happens when an earthquake shakes the soil and
sediments on the earth's surface.
</P>
<P>
   A team led by Fineberg will soon publish the results of
experiments showing that the oscillons and Loch Ness structures
occur in an even wider range of materials than had been known. The
experiments, which will be described in the journal Physical Review
Letters, vibrated what in technical jargon are known as colloidal
suspensions. ``It's essentially mud,'' said Fineberg, who mixed
potter's clay with water.
</P>
<P>
   The experiments, Fineberg said, show that the oscillons do not
just occur in granular media.
</P>
<P>
   Fineberg's work could lead to explanations of why some of the
greatest destruction from earthquakes often occurs in swatches of
land reclaimed from the sea, like the Marina District in the San
Francisco earthquake of 1989. Such land, when shaken with extreme
violence, can liquefy and begin to flow. ``In several places where
earthquakes caused damage, there have been clear indications of
this liquefaction phenomenon,'' Ben-Zion said.
</P>
<P>
   Fineberg's laboratory experiments could have an impact on how
buildings are constructed and reinforced in regions prone to
earthquakes. But because scientists are still far from pinning down
the connection between Fineberg's laboratory experiments and actual
earthquakes, they are pushing for an understanding of the basic
physics of oscillons and the Loch Ness structures.
</P>
<P>
   Fineberg's experiments offer promise, said Paul Umbanhowar, a
physicist at Northwestern University. ``The exciting thing about
the system is that this is a material that's a lot closer to water
than to a granular material,'' said Umbanhowar, meaning that its
properties should be similar to those of a substance that is well
understood.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The oscillons and the Loch Ness structures are related to
humplike waves discovered in water confined by a canal, and found
in a variety of natural settings _ including the electrified gases
surrounding the earth.
</P>
<P>
   Umbanhowar and two colleagues discovered oscillons in a
vibrating dish of beads in 1996. ``No one predicted it,'' said
Sidney Nagel, a physicist at the University of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Fineberg went looking for the structures in colloidal
suspensions both because of Umbanhowar's work and because of
anecdotal reports of earthquakes producing large terrestrial
ripples. In one case, a farmer reported such a wave rumbling across
a cornfield ``kind of like if you shook a rug,'' Fineberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The muddy suspensions were also expected to share a crucial
property with the granular materials that is similar to the way a
glob of peanut butter retains its form but flows easily when it is
pushed with a knife.
</P>
<P>
   This means that the oscillons can bounce up and down in a
vibrating dish while the material around them stays in place.
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly what the Hebrew University team observed when
they vibrated shallow, mud-filled dishes the size of large saucers
up and down at frequencies from 10 to 60 times a second. Once the
experimenters induced oscillons to form, in some cases by blowing
on the surface of the mud, the structures remained in one place,
rising and falling from a hill shape to a crater shape and back
again.
</P>
<P>
   The Loch Ness structures also rose and fell, but also moved
around in the dish. ``They're kind of neat critters,'' Fineberg
said.
</P>
<P>
   If structures like these were generated during earthquakes,'' he
said, it would mean that some buildings should be protected not
only against drastic side-to-side motions, as many are now, but
also against vertical jolts. Areas that are most at risk from these
structures might be identified in advance.
</P>
<P>
   For all the apparent similarities between the laboratory
experiments and nature at its most destructive, other scientists
caution that such analogies go only so far, and that there is
probably more than one way for seismic waves to concentrate their
power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of the `spherical horse' approximation,'' Nagel said
of the tendency of physicists to make highly idealized assumptions
about nature. He was alluding to a joke about a physicist hired by
a dairy to increase milk production. To simplify his calculations,
the physicist assumed all cows to be spherical. ``None of this is
presumably the right prescription that takes into account the full
complexity of the situation,'' Nagel said.
</P>
<P>
   But those who have lived through a devastating earthquake must
surely hope that science can at least turn the uncontrollable into
the comprehensible.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Tropical air streaming northward along the southeast and middle
Atlantic coasts will be laden with rain clouds. On Monday, over 2
inches of rain fell in Raleigh, N.C., raising the September total
to 18.5 inches, their wettest month ever.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, showers will spread as far north as central
Pennsylvania as humid air flows inland from the western Atlantic. A
large high-pressure system near Nova Scotia will circulate dry and
mild air into New England where intervals of clouds and sunshine
prevail.
</P>
<P>
   The leading edge of a very cool air mass will push quickly
southward into Texas and very slowly eastward across the
Mississippi Valley. A widening band of showers will attend the cold
front from Kansas and Oklahoma to Michigan. A wedge of sultry air
will precede the front in the Ohio and Tennessee valleys, perhaps
leading to the development of strong thunderstorms later Tuesday or
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Despite high pressure cresting over Wyoming, low clouds and
mixed showers will persist along the east slopes of the Rockies
from the Laramie Mountains to the Sangre De Cristo Mountains in
southern Colorado. It will be much cooler in western Texas on
Tuesday. Most of the plains will be dull and rather cool.
</P>
<P>
   Strengthening winds will blow off the Pacific coast as surface
pressures rise over the central Rockies. Record heat and gusty
canyon winds will aggravate the forest-fire problems in California.
It will be very chilly Tuesday morning in the interior West with
ample sunshine bringing milder afternoon conditions. The Northwest
will be bright and warmer in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: The State of Contrast
</P>
<P>
   At daybreak on Saturday, the mercury slipped to a record low of
30 degrees at the Alpena airport in northern lower Michigan.
Shortly after 3 p.m. on Sunday, the temperature tied a record high
of 82 degrees at Muskegon in southwest Michigan. These contrasts
stem from the rapid temperature changes associated with an
increased vigor in the jet stream. A polar air mass brought a touch
of autumn chill to northern Michigan at the start of the weekend,
but its return circulation was strong enough to draw very warm air
back into the Great Lakes by late Monday. A more active jet stream
may bring record chill back to the region this week.

TRIPP SUES WHITE HOUSE, DEFENSE DEPARTMENT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Accused phone-tapper Linda Tripp sued the White
House and Defense Department on Monday, alleging that federal
officials illegally used confidential records to discredit her
during the Monica Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit accuses the Clinton administration of misusing
Tripp's confidential personnel records, FBI files and security
forms to obtain and spread ``embarrassing or damaging information
... for partisan political purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   It names only two Pentagon officials individually as defendants,
then lists 11 White House figures, including first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton, as having ``engaged in communications ... about
Linda R. Tripp.'' The lawsuit does not allege that the
communications by Hillary Clinton and others close to the president
were unlawful.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp, a former White House employee who was transferred to the
Pentagon, swore in several documents during her 25-year government
career that she had never been arrested, when in fact she had been.
Her lawsuit alleges that information from those documents was
disclosed to the news media in violation of the federal Privacy Act
as part of a campaign to discredit her in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, Tripp was accused of grand larceny in the alleged theft
of $263 in cash and a $600 watch, charges that her lawyers say were
dropped. Tripp said the items were planted in her handbag by
friends as part of a teen-age prank.
</P>
<P>
   Named as defendants in Tripp's lawsuit are the White House, the
Department of Defense, Assistant Secretary of Defense Kenneth Bacon
and former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Clifford Bernath.
At the time of the disclosure, Bacon and Bernath worked in the
Pentagon's public affairs department.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington, asks for
unspecified damages.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp's lawsuit says the effort to smear her reputation and
intimidate her began immediately after she gave independent counsel
Kenneth Starr tapes of secretly recorded telephone conversations
with Lewinsky. In those tapes, Lewinsky described her affair with
Clinton and their efforts to hide the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes prompted Starr to expand his investigation of Clinton
to include his affair with the former White House intern, a line of
inquiry that led to the president's impeachment by the House in
December 1998. Clinton was acquitted by the Senate in February.
</P>
<P>
   In July, a state grand jury in Maryland, where Tripp resides,
indicted her on charges of illegally taping a December 1997
telephone conversation with Lewinsky. Tripp also was charged with
illegally directing her attorney to disclose the contents of the
tape to Newsweek magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp's lawsuit was assigned to U.S. District Judge Royce
Lamberth, who was appointed to the bench by President Reagan.
Lamberth also is handling several other lawsuits in which the
Clinton administration is accused of misusing FBI files of various
Republicans, including Rep. Bob Barr, a Georgia conservative and
frequent Clinton critic; Billy Ray Dale, who was fired from the
White House travel office; and M. Dennis Sculimbrene, a former FBI
agent.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration declined comment. ``Since there is
litigation pending, this is not something we should comment on in
any respect,'' said Jim Kennedy, a spokesman for the White House
counsel's office.

A DEBATE OVER SAFETY OF SOFTENERS FOR PLASTIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By HOLCOMB B. NOBLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   They are called phthalates, and their job is to make plastic
flexible so it can be used in tubes for blood transfusions,
intravenous feeding and other life-support systems at hospitals and
clinics around the world _ and in some children's toys.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with these chemicals, some scientists and consumer
advocates say, is that they may be dangerous: small amounts can
leach into the bloodstream and have been shown in animal studiecs
say.
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists say phthalates (pronounced THAL-ates) are
perfectly safe, and the chemicals won a significant ally in June,
when a panel of scientists led by Dr. C. Everett Koop, the former
Surgeon General, backed that view. But instead of quieting the
critics, the panel's findings have provoked an outcry.
</P>
<P>
   Health Care Without Harm, an international coalition of 180
organizations of health workers, advocacy groups and
environmentalists, has issued its own report sharply critical of
the Koop panel's findings, calling them ``an incomplete, deceptive
and misleading analysis of the scientific literature.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ted Schettler, director of the Science and Environmental
Health Network, a group of doctors and research scientists that is
a member of the coalition, accused the panel of omitting
significant scientific work, reporting findings not made in the
studies it cited, and misrepresenting data from others.
</P>
<P>
   The American Council on Science and Health, the nonprofit group
that organized the Koop panel and paid for the study, denied that
the findings were in any way deceptive. Dr. Elizabeth M. Whelan,
president of the council, said it ``stands firmly behind the
conclusions drawn from the weight of the scientific evidence by Dr.
Koop and his distinguished colleagues,'' and added, ``As Dr. Koop
has said, `Consumers can be confident that vinyl medical devices
and toys are safe.'''
</P>
<P>
   The issue is under investigation by the Federal Food and Drug
Administration, the National Institutes of Health and National
Academy of Sciences. They are all looking at human risks associated
with two phthalates studied in the Koop report: Di(2-ethylhexyl)
phthalates, or DEHP, the primary plasticizer in medical devices,
and diisononyl phthalates, or DINP, in toys.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, the Consumer Product Safety Commission asked
manufacturers to stop using the DINP phthalates to make plastic
teethers, rattles and nipples because of safety concerns. The next
month, the National Environmental Trust and 11 other consumer
groups sought a ban of phthalates from toys for children under 5.
Previously, eight European countries had banned or regulated the
substance in toys.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Whelan says that at that point Koop suggested that she
organize a panel of experts, which he would ultimately head, to
evaluate the concerns. In December, the Consumer Product Safety
Commission urged parents to throw away nipples and pacifiers
containing DINP, but said it did not have enough evidence to issue
a ban.
</P>
<P>
   In February, after Health Care Without Harm reported on apparent
risks in medical equipment, the American Council on Science and
Health expanded its study.
</P>
<P>
   Schettler did not analyze the toys portion of the Koop report.
But he said the section on medical devices had several problems.
Among them, he said was that in reviewing whether the chemical
exposures caused reproductive problems in animals, it cited studies
of animals too old to prove or disprove the question.
</P>
<P>
   The damage, he said, appears to occur in fetuses or infant
animals, and at much lower doses of exposure than those the panel
used for evaluating risks to humans _ particularly in testicular
development.
</P>
<P>
   The author of the Koop panel's report, Daland R. Juberg,
director of the International Center for Toxicology and Medicine in
Rochester, disputed those criticisms. For one thing, he said, the
panel ``clearly indicated'' that young animals appear to be more
sensitive than older animals.
</P>
<P>
   And he said the panel had indeed been interested in whether
testicular effects had been observed in various species, and
specifically noted that species like hamsters and marmoset monkeys
had not shown a similar sensitivity to phthalate exposure.
Moreover, he said, nonhuman primates are relatively resistant to
testicular effects.
</P>
<P>
   Schettler said Koop and the other panelists made no mention of a
study of three premature babies whose poorly oxygenated blood
needed mechanical ventilation. The infants developed lung disorders
while they were being ventilated with oxygen through a vinyl tube
in the trachea attached to a respirator, and phthalates in the
tubing were transported to the lungs.
</P>
<P>
   One died of complications from the ventilation; the other two
recovered after the tubing was replaced with a phthalate-free
material, ethylenevinyentilation, the very small number that this
case involved and the thousands of infants that received artificial
ventilation on a daily basis without evidence of health effects,
that a causal relationship between DEHP exposure and effects in
these infants could not be inferred from this study.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief among Schettler's other complaints was that the Koop panel
was deceptive in stating that no harm to kidneys were reported in
one study, because, in fact, the study was not done on kidneys at
all but rather on liver, cardiac and lung effects.
</P>
<P>
   Juberg replied that the panel ``was not deceptive in any way,
but rather assessed all of the evidence available to render a
conclusion as to possible renal effects in humans.'' He cited a
review of the animal and human toxicology literature, published in
1990, concluding that there was no evidence to support the
hypothesis that phthalates caused of kidney cancer in humans.
</P>
<P>
   Until the federal agencies weigh in on the issue, the debate is
likely to rest there, leaving consumers to wonder whether what gets
under their skin is safe for them.

 &HT;    Falcons try to pinpoint reasons for slow startBy Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Falcons coach Dan Reeves fiddled with an empty cup
Monday, avoiding as long as possible the team meeting.
</P>
<P>
   At 2 p.m., as players filed inside, Reeves, most of his staff
and even general manager Harold Richardson waited outside, where _
fittingly _ it was gray and gloomy.
</P>
<P>
   After an 0-3 start, the Falcons are shocked and melancholy. Last
year's dream ride to the Super Bowl is starting to fade, just as
the 1999 team seems to be making a hauntingly similar return to
Atlanta's pre-1998 history, when the franchise had just seven
winning seasons in 32.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a win bad,'' Reeves said. ``When you are losing, you
never have confidence. Losing brings the wrong kinds of things _
people second-guessing you, people talking about how bad you are
playing. That is constantly all you read and all you hear.''
</P>
<P>
   After Sunday's 35-7 loss at St. Louis, the Falcons have many
more questions than answers.
</P>
<P>
   The most basic is, when will quarterback Chris Chandler's
strained right hamstring allow him to play again? Don't bet on
Sunday's game against Baltimore (1-2).
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't feel good,'' Chandler said Monday after
re-aggravating the injury a day earlier and then wondering if he
should have played at all. ``It doesn't feel like (he should have)
today.''
</P>
<P>
   On a bigger scale, how can the Falcons turn things around? They
are going through more problems than the injuries alone.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves noted that the Rams `` looked like they were playing a
different speed than what we were.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what is going on,'' second-year right tackle
Ephraim Salaam said. ``All I've known as a Falcon was 14-2, when we
got on a good roll and felt good about ourselves. There's a lot
more pressure on us. Every game is a playoff atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams get real jacked up to play us,'' Salaam said. ``We just
played slow.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting off to a slow start didn't help.
</P>
<P>
   The season-opening 17-14 loss to the Vikings _ a game in which
Atlanta had three turnovers, Minnesota none, and Morten Andersen
missed two field goals under 40 yards _ is three weeks old. But
it's still fresh in the minds of the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I've been in the league, if you win early, you go
farther,'' nine-year strong safety Marty Carter said. ``Teams that
lose games they had a chance to win, it seems like their attitude
and morale change. You're trying not to lose instead of win.''
</P>
<P>
   Injuries _ especially a season-ender to All-Pro running back
Jamal Anderson and to Chandler _ have been painful. But healthy
players aren't executing, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``There probably was not anybody . . . that didn't have at least
one or two plays that we really bad,'' Reeves said. ``You know,
bone-head type plays. I didn't see the intensity, the flying
around.''
</P>
<P>
   The players have not held their own meeting, just several
informal gatherings. ``Talking ain't going to get it done,'' Salaam
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we can play,'' running back Byron Hanspard said.
``It's an individual mental process right now. Everybody has to
look in the mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can read stuff, Hanspard said, ``and . . . get discouraged
or upset. Or, if you know who you are, you won't allow that to
affect you.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Ray Buchanan said the end is not as near as some
might think. It would help, he said, if the Falcons could get back
to opportunistic football.
</P>
<P>
   They led the NFL last year with a plus-20 turnover ratio. This
year, they are minus-six and haven't recovered a fumble, after
leading the league with 25 last season. Atlanta also has only two
sacks in there games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ain't no real biggie right now,'' Buchanan said. ``I've
been beaten before. We got to get heat on the quarterback. We got
to get turnovers; that's how we won games last year.''
</P>
<P>
   If over-reacting is not a concern, Reeves also said he doesn't
believe under-reacting is, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our guys take it seriously,'' he said. ``Again, it is
the mental aspect of it.''

POP REVIEW: TWO FRIENDS ROCKED IN THE BOSOM OF COUNTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris, sisterly
solidarity means harmony: a sweet, close, carefully aligned blend.
Their concert at the Beacon Theater on Sunday night, part of a tour
promoting their new duet album, ``Western Wall'' (Asylum/Elektra),
was a night of ballads, full of promises of nurturing affection. It
was also a reflection on their long friendship and a valedictory
for the country-rooted rock that built both women's careers.
</P>
<P>
   They are as different, as Ms. Harris said onstage, as a city
mouse and a country mouse. Since 1980 Ms. Ronstadt has applied her
big, torchy voice to Tin Pan Alley standards, Mexican mariachi, new
wave rock and Gilbert and Sullivan operettas as well as the
soft-rock songs that made her one of the most consistent hit makers
of the 1970s. Ms. Harris, with her wiry soprano, has stayed closer
to bluegrass and country-and-western music; keeping an Appalachian
twang in her voice, she helped create country's new-traditionalist
movement and provided a template for the alternative country of the
1990s. They looked back to straightforward country when they made
albums with Dolly Parton as Trio; recording as a duo, they found
common ground in folk rock and country rock.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Harris, who is 52, and Ms. Ronstadt, 53, have nearly stopped
singing about youthful passions. The songs they chose were
reflective, wistfully looking back on lost romances and offering a
maternal kind of love, directly in Sinead O'Connor's ``This Is to
Mother You'' and in ``The Sweetest Gift,'' a bluegrass chestnut.
The music clung to 1970s style, except for ``Sweet Spot,'' a song
by Ms. Harris and Jill Cunniff of Luscious Jackson that relies on a
terse bass riff. Most of the songs were steady-strummed folk-rock,
rising methodically from lone voice and guitar to stately full-band
arrangements; Ms. Ronstadt and Ms. Harris traded lead vocals and
sang self-effacing harmonies. They rocked, mostly, like a cradle.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the songs from ``Western Wall,'' like David Olney's
``1917'' (a French-cabaret-tinged song about a woman's night with a
doomed soldier) and Rosanne Cash's ``Western Wall,'' had a dulcet
grace. But too often, their determined cooperation and restraint
made the music too careful, with more effort expended on shaping
perfect syllables than in telling the songs' stories. The band held
back, too, sparking briefly in a speedy banjo solo by Bernie Leadon
and in hints of honky-tonk from Buddy Miller and Greg Leisz on
guitars.
</P>
<P>
   When Phoebe Snow stepped up for the last encore, she revealed
what the concert had lacked: a sense of risk and rivalry. Singing
``Bring It on Home to Me,'' Ms. Ronstadt swooped down to the melody
from above, and Ms. Snow set out to top her, whooping a few
gospelly phrases. Then they harmonized, having dared to cut loose.

GOODWILL'S BOOKS-ONLY STORE WILL BE SECOND IN COUNTRY

   SARASOTA, Fla. _ Sarasota's newest bookstore stocks national
best sellers, including novels by Tom Clancy and Stephen King, all
with a deep discount.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not one of those new megastores, and there's no coffee
shop or reading room with comfy chairs. This scaled-down operation
comes from Goodwill Industries, where operating on a lean budget to
make a few bucks to help others is the norm.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people think of Goodwill, books are not the first thing
that come to mind,'' said Mary Lou England, manager of the new
Goodwill Centergate Bookstore. ``But if you need a Turkish-American
dictionary, we've got it.''
</P>
<P>
   The store, which will open Friday, is the second Goodwill store
in the country to be devoted entirely to books. The first store
opened in Lakeland, Fla., nearly seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The stock includes about 16,000 softcover and 2,000 hardcover
books. Each donated book is inspected, cleaned and shelved
according to category. Area Goodwill outlets have been sending all
of their books to the new location for two months, and nearly 300
titles are expected to arrive daily from collection sites
throughout Southwest Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The Sarasota store is expected to raise $500,000 annually, which
will go toward Goodwill ManaSota's $8.5 million budget. The
nonprofit agency has 36 other retail outlets in Sarasota, Manatee,
Hardee and DeSoto counties that raise the bulk of the funds for its
programs. Goodwill teaches jobs skills, fosters educational
opportunities and helps people with physical and mental challenges
improve their housing conditions, among other programs.

`FRONTLINE': PORTRAIT OF THE POPE, CONFRONTING THE TIDES OF
HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: Production notes at end of review.) 
(nk) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sunday night's thoughtful ``Frontline'' portrait of John Paul II
presents the popular pope as a man resisting, in the name of the
church he leads, many of the century's movements of which he
despairs. He has been a triumphant force against Communism, a
somewhat embattled opponent of church reforms, particularly as they
might affect women, and a critic of capitalism run amok. In
powerful exhortations that sometimes cut across the usual
ideological lines, he has become the world's voice against what he
calls a prevailing ``culture of death,'' whether it be in the form
of capital punishment or abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Whitney, the producer of ``John Paul II: The Millennial
Pope,'' begins with sensitively evoked scenes of the Poland in
which Karol Wojtyla grew up and the religious traditions that in
time drew him to the priesthood. Anti-Semitism was prevalent, and
although the young man had many Jewish acquaintances, during the
Nazi occupation, says Arthur Hertzberg, a professor of Jewish
studies at New York University, ``He did not defy the Nazis in any
overt way,'' and did nothing to save their victims.
</P>
<P>
   Yet after the war he earned a reputation for helping Jews, and
as pope he has made several gestures, like declaring anti-Semitism
to be a sin, that suggest a recognition that his church had failed
during the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Although the young priest remained apolitical when Poland was
dominated by the Soviet Union, he later added a forceful voice to
the anti-Communist Solidarity movement. His message to his
countrymen was, ``Be not afraid.'' Without his support of Poland's
nonviolent revolution, the program goes so far as to suggest, the
Soviet empire would not have collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   But his anti-Marxism also carried the day when it came to
dealing with despots in Latin America. He opposed liberation
theology among the Roman Catholic clergy and did what he could to
destroy that revolutionary movement and suppress its supporters.
</P>
<P>
   A particularly telling passage connects the pope's devotion to
the Virgin Mary with his steadfast opposition to birth control and
the ordination of women as priests. It is as though such changes in
the role of women offend his deeply held vision of the purity of
Mary.
</P>
<P>
   In his most important encyclical, ``The Gospel of Life,'' John
Paul II denounced not only contraception and abortion but also
euthanasia. In his dark vision abortion and capital punishment are
linked as the sins of a materialist culture that is willing to end
life for the convenience of individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Whitney concludes her otherwise illuminating biography with
the purported spiritual experiences of Robert Stone, Germaine
Greer, the cabaret singer Andrea Marcovicci and others. Whatever
one makes of them, they tell little about the Pope. but the rest of
these insightful and provocative two and a half hours easily make
up for that lapse.

 &HT;    UT officials respond to ESPN report on possible violationsBy
Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Tennessee will investigate a report that tutors wrote
papers and did other academic work for football players, athletics
director Doug Dickey said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the allegations are not proved, the school might
have violated NCAA rules by failing to follow procedures when the
possibility of academic fraud was raised.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN reported Sunday night that its Internet web site, ESPN.com,
had posted a copyrighted story detailing possible violations of the
Tennessee honor code and NCAA rules, dating back to 1995. ESPN's 11
p.m. ``SportsCenter'' show aired a version of the story, which was
based on confidential memos and a six-week investigation
</P>
<P>
   The story claimed that as many as five athletes and four tutors
were involved in situations that could constitute academic fraud.
The charges came from memos written by Robin Wright, a former
coordinator for academic programs. The charges range from tutors
writing papers for athletes to tutors actually going to the classes
and taking notes for Volunteer players. Wright has since Tennessee
and is working at Stephen F. Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the players involved in Wright's memos have left the
school, and at least two of the tutors were fired.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee officials learned about the ESPN story Saturday
morning, just hours before the Volunteers' game with Memphis. The
school then held redshirt freshmen Leonard Scott, Reggie Ridley,
Keyone Whiteside and Ryan Rowe out of the game, pending an
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Head football coach Phillip Fulmer was not named in any of the
allegations. Fulmer said Monday he will defer comment to Dickey and
University president J. Wade Gilley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a lot of facts right now, and, until we get
them, we have to do what's best for these young men and what's best
for the university,'' Dickey said. ``We have to deal with the
eligibility of these players in the short term and then we have to
turn our attention to the larger issue.''
</P>
<P>
   That larger issue is whether the claims in the ESPN piece are
true and whether they represent a more widespread problem of
academic fraud involving Tennessee athletes. Earlier this year, a
former tutor at Minnesota claimed she had written more than 400
papers for athletes. After an investigation, basketball coach Clem
Haskins was forced to resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The allegation is that some of this goes back three or four
years, which is something we can't deal with in a week,'' Dickey
said. ``We need some time to get all the information we need. Then
we will deal with the specifics of the allegations.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the allegations are not proved, Tennessee still could be
in trouble with the NCAA. The ESPN story said that Wright sent
copies of all of her memos to Carmen Tegano, the school's assistant
athletic director of student life, but that the information never
was forwarded to Tennessee officials in charge of NCAA rules
compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Malcolm McInnis, Tennessee's NCAA compliance officer,
nor Carl Asp, the faculty athletic representative, knew about the
situation until contacted by ESPN for the story. Dickey said he,
too, was not aware of the charges until Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA requires that all alleged rules violations, no matter
how insignificant they might appear to be, be subject to specific
university reporting procedures.
</P>
<P>
   At Georgia, for example, all senior members of the athletics
staff must sign compliance forms stating that they have reported
all known violations to responsible university officials. In UGA's
case those officials are athletics director Vince Dooley, president
Michael Adams and Hoke Wilder, the assistant athletics director for
compliance and legislative services.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to send information on alleged rules violations up the
chain of command is in itself an NCAA violation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very basic requirement at every school,'' said Wilder,
Georgia's compliance director since 1991. ``You have an obligation
to disclose and report any violation or potential violation. The
procedure has to be followed.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickey said, ``If we had a procedure that broke down, then we'll
fix that procedure and move on. But right now, we don't know the
scope of what we're dealing with.''

McCAIN ISSUES `NEW PATRIOTIC CHALLENGE' IN ANNOUNCING RUN ATBy GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ Conceding that his campaign will be an uphill
battle against money and the son of a former president, Republican
Sen. John McCain of Arizona officially opened his bid for the
presidency Monday, promising to restore dignity and honor to a
``corrupt'' national political system he described as ``a spectacle
of selfish ambition.''
</P>
<P>
   Issuing what he called ``a new patriotic challenge,'' McCain
called on Americans to join him in his crusade to overhaul campaign
finance laws and eliminate ``pork-barrel spending,'' which he said
has drained precious resources away from the nation's defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``As president, I won't ask how much security we can afford.
I'll ask, how much security do we need,'' said McCain, a former
Navy pilot who was shot down over North Vietnam and held prisoner
for 5 1/2 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will find the resources to pay for it. But I won't tolerate
one dime of our defense budget being wasted to re-elect
shortsighted politicians who put their own ambitions before the
national interest,'' McCain added in a reference to many of his
fellow lawmakers caught up in the quest for special interest money
to finance their political careers.
</P>
<P>
   Although McCain has been the leading champion of eliminating
unlimited and unregulated ``soft money'' from the political system,
his repeated efforts to push campaign reform through Congress have
failed.
</P>
<P>
   But he insisted Monday that the cause of reform must be won to
help restore Americans' faith in their government.
</P>
<P>
   McCain set his speech in Greeley Park, where John F. Kennedy
formally announced his run for the presidency 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He emphasized his positions on a host of issues, including his
support for education vouchers, preserving Social Security, free
trade, and giving tax cuts to low- and middle-income individuals
over corporations. But it was his hard-line stand against what he
called the corruption of the nation's political system through
campaign donations and for strengthening the nation's military that
roused the hearts of 500 of his supporters who showed up to cheer
his announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``When our government has been taken from us by the special
interests, the big-dollar donors, pride is lost to shame. When our
politics are corrupted by money and lies, trust is lost to
cynicism,'' McCain said to heavy applause. He declared the current
campaign finance system to be ``nothing more than a sophisticated
influence peddling scheme,'' where government is ``auctioned to the
highest bidder.'' The result, he said, is wasted spending that
drains precious resources from defense and other important
programs.
</P>
<P>
   He called on Americans to join him in reclaiming ``our
government'' from ``the power-brokers and special interests.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our new patriotic challenge ... Restoring honesty to
our political system is the gateway through which all other policy
reforms must pass,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's announcement in New Hampshire, site of the nation's
first primary next year, was delivered shortly before former Vice
President Dan Quayle formally withdrew from the Republican
presidential contest. Quayle's departure narrows the Republican
field to eight, and could help McCain or other GOP hopefuls,
including Elizabeth Dole, in their effort to stop Texas Gov. George
W. Bush from steamrolling his way to the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has already raised $55 million and remains the preferred
choice among likely GOP voters in New Hampshire and most other
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   But a Boston Globe poll last month showed McCain up from single
digits among New Hampshire Republicans to 16 percent against Bush's
40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   McCain spokesman Howard Opinsky said the senator's ``challenge
now ... is to get better known, and that's what we're going to be
focusing our efforts on in the coming weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's Nashua speech was the beginning of a four-day campaign
swing through the three states where he plans to focus his campaign
before the primary season begins early next year.
</P>
<P>
   But before climbing aboard his campaign plane Monday morning,
McCain visited his alma mater, the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis,
Md. Aides said he had breakfast there with 4,000 midshipmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I began this day as I began my career of service to our nation
_ in the company of United States Naval Academy midshipmen,''
McCain told the Nashua crowd. ``There is no more appropriate place
for me to have begun this mission than Annapolis.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, the son and grandson of Navy admirals, did begin his
military and government service at the academy, where, he often
notes, he finished next to last in his class. He went on to become
a Navy flier in the Vietnam War. In 1969, on a bombing mission over
Hanoi, he was shot down and imprisoned until the end of the war.
McCain endured torture and refused an early release on several
occasions, adhering to the military's tradition of ``first in,
first out.''
</P>
<P>
   He won election to Congress in the early 1980s along with other
Reagan Republicans. He was elected to the Senate in 1986, where he
says the discipline and pride in country he learned as military
officer has guided his decisions as a lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on his military record, McCain sought in his speech to
distinguish himself from Bush, who served in the National Guard in
Texas. Although he did not mention Bush by name, he said no other
candidate running has been as well-prepared as he to assume the job
of commander-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a president makes life-and-death decisions he should draw
strength and wisdom from broad and deep experience with the reasons
for and risks of committing our children to our defense. I am not
afraid of the burden. I know both the blessing and the price of
freedom,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   And in a reference to President Clinton, McCain vowed to restore
dignity to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will do everything in my power to make you proud of your
government,'' McCain said, adding that ``something has gone
terribly wrong'' when parents no longer want their children to grow
up to be president.

 &HT;    Profile of Bill Bradley
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Bill Bradley joined the Senate in 1979 after
10 years with the New York Knicks, he turned down interview
requests that focused on his storied basketball career. Bradley
said he wanted to be known as a senator, not a basketball player.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as he campaigns for president, Bradley usually works in one
or two jokes about his basketball playing days, particularly to
audiences in the Northeast where the Knicks-Boston Celtics rivalry
is hot.
</P>
<P>
   The stories help remind voters that Bradley was a star, and they
feed into the fascination that many voters have with the 6-foot-5
forward as he campaigns for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But hoop jokes aside, playing basketball helped transform
Bradley into a fierce competitor and a disciplined, focused
athlete. It made him rich and famous years before he entered
politics. Bradley also credits basketball with shaping many of his
views on life, especially on race relations in America.
</P>
<P>
   Tall for his age, Bradley enjoyed an immediate height advantage
when he began playing basketball in his hometown of Crystal City,
Mo. But it was his discipline and relentless devotion to practice
that made him the best player on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I took a shower, he'd be up there shooting, 10-15 shots
from different places on court,'' says Tom Haley, his former high
school teammate. ``He'd make them all before he quit.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley had more than 70 scholarship offers from around the
country, but chose to attend Princeton, an Ivy League school.
</P>
<P>
   ``By physical standards, he was an average player, and yet he
was an all-American for three years,'' says Bill van Breda Kolff,
his former coach. It was all done by practice, practice, practice,
hard work and dedication.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Breda Kolff says he told Bradley one year to stop using an
ineffective left hook shot. The next year, Bradley made sure van
Breda Kolff was watching during one of the first practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw in a lefty hook and it went right in,'' van Breda
Kolff says. ``And I said, `You must have worked on it all summer,'
and he said, `Yup.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's greatest knack, van Breda Kolff says, was his ability
to make his teammates play their best game, a talent that helped
him succeed in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not as big, not as strong, couldn't run as fast,
couldn't lift as many weights, but he was smarter, so smart about
the game,'' says van Breda Kolff.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was a member of the 1964 U.S. Olympic basketball team
that defeated the Soviets in Tokyo. He was featured extensively in
Sports Illustrated and was the subject of a book by John McPhee,
``A Sense of Where You Are.''
</P>
<P>
   He signed a $500,000 contract with the Knicks in 1967, a huge
sum for the time, and began his pro career with intense
expectations. His first two years were disappointing. Instead of
cheers, Bradley frequently was booed.
</P>
<P>
   Those two years seem to get lost among all the records Bradley
set and the championships he won. But he recalls them as among the
most difficult in his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was down awhile, because I was failing and people were
throwing coins at me and booing and spitting and accosting me on
the street,'' he says. ``It wasn't a pleasant time.''
</P>
<P>
   All the early hype was tough for Bradley, says Willis Reed, his
former Knick teammate. ``He did not want all the limelight,'' Reed
says. ``I think he kind of wanted to live his own life.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks won the NBA championship in 1970 and 1973, and
Bradley was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1982, his
first year of eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, writing about his basketball days, Bradley said his
experience with the Knicks made him more sensitive to racial
inequality in America. He turned down product endorsements, because
he felt they were coming to him instead of his more talented black
teammates because he was white.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, however, shared none of these views with his teammates
at the time, says Reed. ``There was no indication of that,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone on the team, however, joked that Bradley would one day
become president, calling him ``Mr. President'' and demanding White
House jobs when he got elected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always used to say I want one of those no-show jobs,'' says
Reed. ``But he was always reserved and would kind of blush a little
bit about it. He said to me that he didn't know what he wanted to
do.''

MANAGERS SHOULD COACH AND COMMUNICATE

By KEN LLOYD  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Q. I was given a very demanding assignment by my
manager, and it did not go well. I take responsibility for the
failure, but I must say that my manager was unresponsive to my
numerous attempts to communicate with him. All he said at the end
was he assumed that if I took on a project, I would get it done.
What do you think of this and what should I do now? F.M.
</P>
<P>
   A. Rather than spending his time making assumptions about what
his staff is doing, your manager should be spending his time
managing, coaching and communicating. When managers disappear and
start making assumptions about their staff, it is time to start
making assumptions about their managerial skills.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, you and he should sit down and discuss what
happened on this project. You need to hear his full evaluation of
your performance, and he needs to hear your thoughts as well. Let
him know about any parts of the project that you enjoyed and that
went particularly well, and then tell him that you believe the
overall project would have met its objectives if you had more
contact and communication with him.
</P>
<P>
   However, rather than dwelling on his ability to be invisible,
try to focus on ways to avoid this kind of problem in the future.
Your next project should include some formal benchmark dates for
the two of you to meet, along with the flexibility to have
additional meetings if key issues, problems or questions arise. You
can assume that anything short of this will only lead to another
failure.
</P>
<P>
   Q. We have a manager whose department is profitable, but his
style is far too aggressive, abrasive and difficult. Turnover in
his department is the highest in our company, and exit interviews
have shown that he is the problem. How do you deal with someone
like this? C.P.
</P>
<P>
   A. This manager may be able to contribute to the bottom line,
but the real bottom line is that he is contributing to
dissatisfaction, conflict, turnover and the possibility of serious
claims against the company. The effectiveness of a manager should
be measured against more than the extent to which his or her
department is profitable.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, when managers are as combative as yours, their
ability to run a profitable department is often short-lived.
Employees may respond to these kinds of managers over the short
term, while over the long term they tend to sabotage, undermine or
quit.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the costs, damage, and potential exposure generated
by this manager, it is important that he be given some specific
feedback on his behavior. He needs to understand the problems that
they cause, along with the expectation that he try to make some
changes. He also needs to understand the consequences if such
behavior continues.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of running a profitable department, it is important to
note that providing this manager with additional coaching and
training could also be profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I need regular information from the business office, but it
is always a battle to get anything from them. I call them, e-mail
them and visit them, and I am able to gradually get what I need,
but this is a big waste of time. How do I get them to do their job?
S.B.
</P>
<P>
   A. When the business office seems to be giving you the business,
there are a number of steps to take, and you have already taken
step one. Namely, you have met with the people in the department
who are supposed to be getting the information to you. Since it
sounds like you have been regularly calling, e-mailing and visiting
them, they obviously know what you need and when you need it, but
nothing is delivered.
</P>
<P>
   This means that it is time for step two, a discussion of the
issue with your manager. After all, this is a situation that is
interfering with the performance, productivity, and general
satisfaction in your department, and hence is an issue that should
interest your manager. Let him know about your efforts to resolve
the matter on your own.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is up to your manager. If your manager is actually
managing, he or she will look into the situation and ultimately
communicate directly with the business office manager. They may be
able to solve the problem on their own, or perhaps there are other
issues that are generating the problem in the first place. It may
even be helpful to bring key employees from the two departments
together to discuss and jointly resolve the matter on their own.
While some conflict between departments is inevitable, letting it
slide is unacceptable.

 &HT;    To forgive is divinely human, Tutu tells youths
 &HT;    By Jennifer Brett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Archbishop Desmond Tutu looked into the rows of young
faces and saw a powerful army.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people are among God's greatest collaborators,'' the
Nobel Laureate told students at Holy Innocents' Episcopal School in
Atlanta Monday. ``God has a dream of a society that is kind and
gentle. God has no one except you to help accomplish that dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Tutu, the former Anglican archbishop of South Africa and a
visiting professor at Emory University, talked about the horrors of
apartheid, intolerance and violence in society. Yet his address was
uplifting, interwoven with humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knock-knock,'' he said, beginning his story of the immaculate
conception of Mary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's there?
</P>
<P>
   ``Gabriel, the archangel. Hi, Mary. God would like you to be the
mother of his son.''
</P>
<P>
   His eyes twinkling, Tutu continued with Mary's response.
</P>
<P>
   ``What? You want me to be what? An unmarried mother? Sorry, I'm
a decent girl. Try next door.''
</P>
<P>
   Tutu's slight frame shook with laughter, but the lighthearted
story had a serious point.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that had been the response of Mary, we would have been up a
creek,'' he said. ``Mary was a teenager. It is interesting how we
see God looking to young people for those who would be God's
special partners. God looks to you.''
</P>
<P>
   In his role as chairman of South Africa's Truth and
Reconciliation Commission, Tutu said he was ``quite shattered at
the awfulness of evil human beings can visit upon other human
beings.'' But he was also moved at victims' ability to forgive.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled the testimony of the daughter of a murdered
activist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked her whether she might have it in her to forgive,'' he
said. ``You could have heard a pin drop as this woman said, `Yes,
we would like to forgive. We need to know who to forgive.' If we
are to have reconciliation and forgiveness in South Africa, it is
going to be because people who have suffered are willing to be
magnanimous and forgive.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that racial strife in the United States will never be
obliterated without similar forums where people can share their
stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it is traumatic to open those wounds that appear to be
healed,'' Tutu said. ``We thought it was important that those
wounds be opened, cleansed, and a balm put on those wounds so this
time when those wounds heal, they will not be festering.''
</P>
<P>
   Tutu told the students they have important roles in making the
world better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes there may be a bully on the playground,'' Tutu said.
``God doesn't usually send a lightning bolt to dispense the bully.
He depends on some of you to stand up to that bully.''
</P>
<P>
   Tutu told the students to think happy thoughts and closed with a
prayer. After his remarks, students surrounded Tutu. He shook their
hands and blessed them and looked delighted to be in the midst of
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're great fun, aren't they?'' Tutu said.

   KOSOVO-ARRESTS (Mitrovica, Kosovo) _ Twenty-six men from one
street in this town have been missing for over five months, ever
since Serb police forced them out from their apartments and
separated them from their wives and children in the street below.
On Monday, their relatives were called to the main police station
here and were told by French gendarmes of the men's fate. It seems
that minutes after the women and children were ordered to flee on
that terrible day, April 14, the men were all executed. The news
brought to an end the families' long search for their menfolk, and
a conclusion to the extensive three-month investigation by the
French. The case is seen as a first in Kosovo where foreign
investigators have conducted a complete investigation, working from
the first reports of missing people to finding a mass grave and
arresting suspects. By Carlotta Gall.

GROUPS PRESS BUSH TO EXAMINE NON-VIOLENT DRUG CASES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A handful of groups hoping to decriminalize some
drug offenses asked Gov. George W. Bush on Monday to examine the
cases of an estimated 28,000 people imprisoned in Texas for
non-violent drug offenses with an eye toward commuting some
sentences or granting pardons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Warehousing the nonviolent (inmates) in Texas prisons does not
increase the safety or security of Texans, nor does it do anything
to help the inmate,'' said Alan Robison, executive director of the
Drug Policy Forum of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, Bush spokeswoman Linda Edwards noted
that under Texas law a governor can commute a sentence or pardon an
individual only at the recommendation of the Texas Board of Pardons
and Paroles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush is reluctant to grant pardons because of his
basic belief that those who commit crimes should suffer the
consequences of those crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing Bush's references to unspecified ``mistakes'' in refusing
to answer questions about whether he used illegal drugs more than
25 years ago, the groups said Bush is proof that young people can
overcome poor choices to experiment with illicit substances and
become productive citizens.
</P>
<P>
   If unsubstantiated allegations that Bush used drugs are true,
then a ``terrible double standard'' exists, Robison added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush thinks that if he did it, it should be regarded
as a youthful indiscretion,'' Robison. ``Whereas if we do it, or at
least if we get caught doing it, we should be punished for it by
being sent to prison.``
</P>
<P>
   Robison's group and several others, including Families Against
Mandatory Minimums and the Texas Hemp Society, said the nation's
War on Drugs and harsh prison sentences have failed to end drug
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``A criminal record for what is often a youthful indiscretion
makes it very difficult for an individual to be fully productive,
tax-paying citizen,'' Robison said. ``It also prevents people from
participating in electoral politics as voters or candidates for
office.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Zeese of the group Common Sense for Drug Policy said Texas
ranks second in the number of disenfranchised voters as a result of
criminal convictions, a situation that has the greatest impact on
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to former first lady Barbara Bush, a Dallas woman
who has three sons in prisons on drug conspiracy charges, asked
Mrs. Bush's help in convincing the governor that drug policies
should be changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Youthful drug use, an issue that you and your son both claim
is `irrelevant' to the governor's personal history, has been made
permanently relevant to us by drug policies of the federal
government and the 50 states, including Texas,'' wrote Virginia
Traylor. ``Our sons will have no second chances.''

 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In its first three months, Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's government has authorized new construction in the West
Bank's Jewish settlements at a pace exceeding that of the
right-wing administration of Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians had hoped that Barak would curtail Netanyahu's
expansion plans for the Jewish settlements to create a better
climate for peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
   But Barak's Housing Ministry, which is controlled by the
settlers' political party, has proceeded with housing projects
begun under Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Housing Ministry officials confirmed Monday that since July the
new government has sought bids for some 2,600 new housing units in
the settlements. Under the previous government, the Israelis
authorized construction of about 3,000 new units a year, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the development is slated for the large urban
settlements close to Jerusalem, although some will take place in
isolated settlements deep inside the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The government's housing plans were revealed on Sunday by Peace
Now, an Israeli group that monitors and opposes settlement
activity.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, condemned
Israel's construction plans as ``destructive to peace.'' The
Palestinians see any settlement expansion as a provocative act
whereby the Israelis seize disputed land whose fate is supposed to
be decided at the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Sunday, Barak himself ordered a review of the Housing
Ministry's plans and procedures.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Monday exactly what happened within the Barak
government.
</P>
<P>
   Questions were raised about whether the Housing Ministry, which
is controlled by the setters' National Religious Party, had
authorized the building starts with the prime minister's tacit
consent or without his direct knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   An official in the prime minister's office implied Monday night
that Barak had been unaware of the construction plan. ``You don't
check every activity of every minister of every office,'' the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   But it seemed unlikely that National Religious Party leaders
would act without at least the presumption that Barak backed them.
And Palestinian officials considered the distinction meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   ``At any rate, he is the prime minister of Israel and the one
responsible,'' said Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestinian official.
``And if he doesn't revoke this decision immediately, he makes
future final status negotiations meaningless.''
</P>
<P>
   Yitzhak Levy, the housing minister and National Religious Party
leader, made it clear that he saw the construction as directly
related to the final status peace talks that recently began. During
those negotiations, the Israelis and the Palestinians will seek
agreement on such deeply emotional issues as the fate of Jerusalem
and of the West Bank settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Settlements near Jerusalem, Levy said, ``certainly have to
undergo a beefing-up process if the government intends to safeguard
Jerusalem in the negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   While settlement activity had increased in the final months of
Netanyahu's administration, the Palestinians had hoped that Barak
would reverse the trend.
</P>
<P>
   Barak himself, however, has pledged only that no new settlements
will be built. His government's written guidelines address the
issue of expanding existing settlements obliquely: ``The government
will offer a response to the ongoing development needs of existing
settlement communities,'' the guidelines say.
</P>
<P>
   The new development is in line with a master plan established by
the Netanyahu government. New construction is to be concentrated in
four settlements ringing Jerusalem, all of which are likely
candidates for annexation to Israel during a final peace agreement:
Maale Adumim, Givat Zeev, Har Adar, and Betar Ilit.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining new units would be scattered through outlying
settlements, for instance near Hebron to the south and the
Palestinian town of Qalqilya to the north.
</P>
<P>
   A Housing Ministry spokesman, Moshe Eilat, said that in past
years about 3,000 new units were built annually. But he said that
no decision had been made ``to build more than last year.'' He said
that it was coincidental that the activity was occurring all at
once, and that it was related to what the Israelis call the
``natural growth'' of the existing settlements.
</P>
<P>
   But Peace Now volunteers said that construction work had not
been bottled up or frozen. And they said that the construction
plans far exceed the natural growth rate of about 2 percent a year.
In Betar Ilit, for instance, an ultra-Orthodox settlement, some
1,100 building starts were just authorized in a community that now
has 2,000 units.
</P>
<P>
   A Cabinet committee on settlements is expected to examine the
development plans and whether the expansion violates the coalition
government's position on settlements. The committee, which is
supposed to meet for the first time in October, is also scheduled
to consider the fate of some 37 illegal outposts set up by settlers
during the Netanyahu days.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, who intentionally included the small settlers' party in
his coalition government, is seeking a broad consensus to back his
peacemaking plans. He does not want to antagonize the settlers,
whose fate depends on the process.
</P>
<P>
   And, if Barak indeed signed off on the expansion plans, it is
possible that he believes he can take a gamble with this move. In a
recent interview with the Jerusalem Post, the Israeli prime
minister said that he is certain Arafat knows that he will not get
back the entire West Bank. The settlements slated to be enlarged
are those least likely to be dismantled.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Barak may be trying to show some support for
the settlers to keep his coalition government behind him on the
peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's hope he's not cutting off his nose to spite his face,''
said Galia Golan, a political scientist at Hebrew University and a
leader of the Peace Now movement. ``Because by expanding the
settlements he is jeopardizing the peace process itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Erekat, the Palestinian official, pointed out that this news
comes three weeks after Barak signed the latest interim peace
agreement at Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt. He noted that Netanyahu
initiated the Har Homa building project on disputed land outside
Jerusalem three weeks after he signed the Hebron Protocol, a
previous interim agreement. The Har Homa project brought
international condemnation and paralyzed the peace negotiations for
18 months.
</P>
<P>
   In a lead editorial, the Haaretz newspaper on Monday called on
Barak to make clear what it described as his ``ambiguous'' and
``contradictory'' position toward settlements, saying that the
construction plans do not square with his desire to make and abide
by peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is quite clear that this kind of building momentum in the
settlements contradicts international commitments that the
government of Israel assumed,'' the editorial said. ``Barak, who is
seeking the confidence of the world's leaders, of his Arab
neighbors and of the public that brought him to power, has the
obligation to resolve this contradiction.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chris Ofili is hunkered down in his central London studio,
screening the avalanche of phone calls he has been getting for the
last few days and trying not to obsess about the uproar over ``The
Holy Virgin Mary,'' his 1996 painting of a black Madonna with a
clump of elephant dung on one breast and cutouts of genitalia from
pornographic magazines in the background.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all seems very distant and confusing to me,'' Ofili said.
``It's like a play, and somehow I got mentioned in the script. I
think there's some bigger agenda here.''
</P>
<P>
   His painting is part of ``Sensation: Young British Artists From
the Saatchi Collection,'' scheduled to open at the Brooklyn Museum
of Art in New York on Saturday. When Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
threatened to cut off the museum's city subsidy and remove its
board if the show was not canceled, he singled out ``The Holy
Virgin Mary,'' along with several other works, as ``sick stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal John O'Connor called the show an attack on religion
itself. The Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights said it
found Ofili's painting offensive, too. After seeing a photograph of
``The Holy Virgin Mary'' in the exhibition's catalog, the league's
president, William Donohue, issued a statement saying people should
picket the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Monday to explain his ``Holy Virgin Mary,'' Ofili said in
a telephone interview: ``I don't feel as though I have to defend
it. The people who are attacking this painting are attacking their
own interpretation, not mine. You never know what's going to offend
people, and I don't feel it's my place to say any more.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews since he won the Turner Prize for young British
artists last year, Ofili spoke broadly about his unconventional
approach to art, including his use of elephant dung and his Roman
Catholic upbringing.
</P>
<P>
   The British-born artist talked about his African heritage, which
led him to visit Zimbabwe, where he was disturbed by the remnants
of colonialism he encountered and was moved by the beauty of the
land and its wildlife, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Ofili's painting is the one most frequently mentioned in
criticism of the Brooklyn show, other works that have drawn fire
also use organic materials, including a shark suspended in a tank
of formaldehyde, a bust of a man made from his own frozen blood and
a folded-over mattress with a water bucket, melons and a cucumber
standing erect between a pair of oranges.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time that Ofili, 31, has found himself in
the center of a hailstorm. After he won the Turner Prize, the
$32,000 award given annually by the Tate Gallery of Art in London,
several London critics denounced the choice as gimmicky and dubbed
Ofili the Elephant Man.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that this time he felt besieged by the public outcry
because he and his work had been singled out.
</P>
<P>
   Ofili, who has a master's degree from the Royal College of Art
in London, is widely known in the art world, and his work is in the
permanent collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Tate
Gallery in London and the Museum of Modern Art in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Elephant dung, which has become something of a signature in
Ofili's paintings, is in large part a cultural reference to his
African heritage, he said. Although he was born in Manchester,
England, both his parents were born in Lagos, Nigeria, and their
first language was Yoruba. (His parents are now divorced, Ofili
said. Both work in biscuit factories, his mother in Manchester and
his father in Nigeria.)
</P>
<P>
   He describes himself as a churchgoing Catholic, although he does
not attend every Sunday. Ofili went to state schools in Manchester
and became interested in furniture design before gravitating to
art.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 24 he decided to learn more about his roots. He won
a scholarship to travel and paint for eight weeks in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was struck by the beauty of the landscape and of the animals
in their natural surroundings,'' he said. ``When a giraffe taller
than the average house in Britain would walk by, it gave me that
particular feeling of being shocked and simultaneously finding
something beautiful. It gave me an excitement and a fear of the
new.''
</P>
<P>
   In Zimbabwe, he said, he was aware of its colonial past. There
were still signs calling the nation Rhodesia, he said, and he
encountered colonialist behavior among some of the people there,
both black and white.
</P>
<P>
   His use of elephant dung, which he gets from the London Zoo, is
in many ways a reaction to what he saw and felt in Africa, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something incredibly simple but incredibly basic about
it,'' Ofili said. ``It attracts a multiple of meanings and
interpretations.''
</P>
<P>
   While news reports have described his paintings as being
splattered with dung, the clumps are actually carefully placed on
each canvas. In one painting a clump of dung is a jeweled brooch
encrusted with gold sparkles on a goddess; in another it is an
abstract element floating in a densely painted background. In yet
another five balls of dung descend in a line, each with a letter
formed from colored pins spelling out the name Rodin. Many of the
works rest on two large clumps of dung, which act almost as feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way of raising the paintings up from the ground and
giving them a feeling that they've come from the earth rather than
simply being hung on a wall,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Ofili's works are vibrantly colored and use multiple
layers of dots (inspired, he said, by images from ancient caves in
Zimbabwe). He frequently uses cutouts of circles reminiscent of
1960s op art or of triangles, based on a set of etchings he made
while visiting New York. His oil paintings often include images cut
from magazines, comic-book-like characters and splashes of
translucent resin.
</P>
<P>
   While he has detractors, the Victoria Miro Gallery on Cork
Street in London and Gavin Brown Enterprises in New York, the two
galleries that represent him, report that they have waiting lists
of collectors demanding his work. One painting sold last year for
$36,052 at Christie's in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was an underbidder on some of those paintings at
Christie's,'' said Dean Valentine, president and chairman of UPN
Network and a collector. ``Of all the young British painters I
think he's by far the best. The paintings have a depth of
expression. He has something to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine admitted that at first the elephant dung did give off
an unpleasant odor. ``It took some work to air it out,'' he said.
``He's not trying to offend but to make you think.''
</P>
<P>
   Gavin Brown, who first showed Ofili's work in 1995, said he
believed the uproar at the Brooklyn Museum ``doesn't bear any
relation to his art.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Paintings aren't offensive,'' Brown added. ``They don't kill
people.''

CLINTON UNVEILS ESTIMATED $115 BILLION BUDGET SURPLUS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton unveiled a projected $115 billion
surplus Monday, hailing it as a ``landmark achievement'' and
calling on Congress to work with him on Social Security, Medicare
and a modest middle-class tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   The new estimate, which would be the largest in history, likely
will be revised again by the Office of Management and Budget after
the 1999 fiscal year ends Thursday. The previous estimate was $99
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The White House sought to use the new financial figure to
underscore its budget battle with Congress. The Republican
leadership has shown no indication of working with Clinton since
the president last week vetoed the GOP's $792 billion tax cut bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a landmark achievement for our economy,'' Clinton said
of the nation's first back-to-back budget surplus since 1957.
``When you consider where we were just seven years ago, it's as
great an American comeback as the Ryder Cup was,'' he said,
referring to the U.S. victory over European golfers Sunday . ``It
is further proof that we're on the right road to prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   Lower debt service costs helped lead to the higher projected
surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called on Congress to work with him to extend the life
of Social Security by 32 years to 2050, to bolster the solvency of
Medicare and provide a prescription drug component. He also wants
investments in education, the environment and agriculture and to
provide incentives for economic development in rural and urban
areas overlooked by the nation's thriving economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do all that and still have an affordable tax cut for
the middle class and pay down our debt so that by 2015, we are
debt-free for the first time since 1835 when Andrew Jackson was
president,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton again asked Congress ``not to throw in the towel'' but
to negotiate with the White House and congressional Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, continued to press Clinton on the issue of tax cuts.
Archer, R-Texas, championed the $792 billion, 10-year tax relief
bill that the president dismissed as ``too big and too bloated''
and a danger to the nation's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``More surplus money for Washington means less money for
families and workers across our country, and tax relief is the only
way to balance the scales,'' Archer said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``But since President Clinton killed tax relief, Republicans
will guard these funds to protect Social Security and Medicare and
pay down the debt - and stop Washington from spending them on a
smorgasbord of government programs.''
</P>
<P>
   The president announced the revised budget estimate during a
Rose Garden ceremony in which he wrote the new figure on a chart as
cameras whirled. Clinton told reporters he remained optimistic
about negotiating a budget agreement that addressed many of his
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``One way or the other the taxpayers are going to be all right,
because we can do pretty well by conflict, I suppose, and
eventually drag this out to where we've at least got a decent
education budget and we're still paying down the debt,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Clinton added that if the nation is going to address
other important issues, such as extending the life of Social
Security and Medicare, then the Republican leadership must work
with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still plenty of time to do this and I hope they'll do
it with me,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress this week will work on a resolution to keep government
operating after the 2000 fiscal year begins on Friday. A temporary
spending measure will give Congress time to complete work on the 13
appropriations bills that fund the government.
</P>
<P>
   The White House also issued a press statement decrying the House
appropriation subcommittee's work on the spending bill for the
Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services and Education.
</P>
<P>
   The statement said the Republican bill ``would devastate
critical investments in education and training and other
programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans want to eliminate many specific federal programs
such as Clinton's plan to place 100,000 new teachers in the
classrooms, place the program money into block grants and allow
states to decide how to spend the money.
</P>
<P>
   While campaigning later for Rep. Bill Jefferson, a Democratic
candidate for governor in Louisiana, Clinton blasted Republicans
over their education measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is wrong to blame the kids and it's wrong not to give the
schools a chance,'' Clinton said.

 UNDATED: kill people.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This fall is to be a big moment for Ofili in the United States.
He has been chosen as one of the 41 artists whose work will be
shown in the Carnegie International, a survey of contemporary art
that opens at the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh on Nov. 6.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 16 Brown is mounting a second show of Ofili's work, five
new paintings that are together being called ``Afrobiotics.''
</P>
<P>
   Ofili said he was concerned about his notoriety. ``I find it
off-putting that people judge you before they know you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While he liked being included in ``Sensation,'' he said he
worried about being seen as one of the Young British Artists and
not as an individual.
</P>
<P>
   ``People see me as part of a package,'' he said. ``It scares
me.''
</P>
<P>
   During an interview in his London studio in August, Ofili worked
on two paintings at once. The larger of the two was of a character
he calls ``magic monkey'' holding up an empty turquoise vessel. He
said the monkey was trying to capture the three powerful elements
of life: sex, money and drugs, which are represented by three
separate clumps of elephant dung bearing the three words formed out
of straight pins with colored tops that he buys at his local
grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   The painting's surface was thick with beads of paint applied
with a thin stick that is actually a brush that has no hairs on it.
Using the kinds of aluminum containers that Chinese takeout food
comes in, Ofili mixed the paint to a consistency he described as
cream. He spread layer upon layer of glitter, besides the painted
dots. On top of that he applied coats of translucent resin to give
the surface a transparency.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's to make it seem that in some ways it's more imagined
than real,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Across the room was another painting, its background
three-quarters finished. Ofili applied large black and white
spirals with a thin brush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I roughly know what I'm doing,'' he said, moving from
the magic monkey to the black spirals. ``It might be a female
portrait. I need a princesslike figure.''
</P>
<P>
   He likened the process to writing a song. ``You know the
lyrics,'' he said. ``Then you want to get the right rhythm and base
line.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the entrance to his London studio that day, several
teen-agers huddled together smoking crack. Above their heads was a
sign warning, ``This area is being constantly watched and patrolled
by the Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   Ofili said he made the sign because he wanted the addicts who
regularly used his doorway to think about what they were doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was brought up a Catholic and was an altar boy,'' he said.
``I believe in God, but I'm not dominated by it. We all studied
math, but we don't go around spewing numbers. Religion should be
used in the appropriate way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The church is not made up of one person but a whole
congregation, and they should be able to interact with art without
being told what to think,'' he continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all about control,'' he added. ``We've seen it before
in history. Sadly, I thought we'd moved on.''

(nk) 
 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the annals of weight loss on Broadway, ``The Scarlet
Pimpernel'' stands out as a model dieter. Frank Wildhorn and Nan
Knighton's retelling of Baroness Orczy's 1905 novel of derring-do
and secret identity during the French Revolution was bloated,
flabby and listless when it opened at the cavernous Minskoff
Theater in 1997, a dinosaur blimp at a moment when even Lord Lloyd
Webber was saying the overblown musical was dead.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a year into the show's run, there occurred the sort of
unlikely transformation found in Jenny Craig commercials. A new
team of producers rushed in with the mission of whipping the
sagging ``Pimpernel'' into shape, and under the direction of Robert
Longbottom (who replaced Peter Hunt), the musical was rewritten,
restaged and significantly recast, giving it discipline, focus and
a newly streamlined shape. It was a makeover that even Cher, the
queen of self-reinvention, might envy.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to the ruling wisdom on Park Avenue, however, it really
is possible to be too thin. After a summer hiatus from New York,
``The Scarlet Pimpernel'' has resurfaced in an even trimmer
incarnation: in a smaller theater (the Neil Simon, which has 400
fewer seats than the Minskoff) with a shallower stage, matched by a
smaller cast (29 instead of 41) and reduced scenery.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a production with a bus-and-truck feeling that,
while still stronger than its original incarnation, is definitely
weaker than its second. With a new trio of stars enacting the
work's central love triangle in scaled-down performances in a more
intimate setting, this latest ``Pimpernel'' asks to be accepted
without the camouflage of spectacle. The show's bones are now
clearly visible, and _ let's face it _ bone structure was never its
strong suit.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Knighton's Harlequin Romance-style book and lyrics remain
essentially as they were in the reworked version of a year ago,
while the score by Wildhorn (``Jekyll and Hyde,'' ``The Civil
War'') is the same old bottle of pop, all carbonated fizz and
syrup. Everything else, from Kim Scharnberg's orchestrations to the
interpretations of its leading characters, feels gentler this time
around, less oversold. Andrew Jackness' revised sets now ask the
audience to fill in the blanks with its imagination, so that the
catacomb-like prison that once stretched across the stage is now
represented by a barred box beneath a guillotine.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, such an approach, so scintillatingly represented by
the current revival of ``Chicago,'' is to be encouraged. But
``Pimpernel,'' which purports to recreate the swashbuckling vigor
of old Warner Bros. costume movies, needs to be loud and flashy if
it is going to work at all.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, its plot, jokes and lyrics are easier to grasp now.
Its leading characterizations, especially from Ron Bohmer and
Carolee Carmello as the English fop with a heroic alter ego and his
plucky French wife, approach psychological realism in ways they
didn't before, and there is a new respectfulness in both the
playing and the singing of Wildhorn's songs.
</P>
<P>
   For once, however, enhanced clarity is not a virtue. The
romantic friction among Percy, a k a the Scarlet Pimpernel
(Bohmer), his wife, Marguerite (Ms. Carmello), and her former
lover, the blood-thirsty French official Chauvelin (Marc Kudisch),
is meant to be rendered in exaggerated postures and declamations.
</P>
<P>
   Outright braggadocio was what made the show's original Percy,
Douglas Sills, so much fun. He had an exuberance verging on camp
that paralleled the boy's-adventure-fantasy aspect, a sense that he
was saying, with every gesture, ``Look, Mom! I'm starring in a
musical on Broadway!'' Tall and handsome in the style of paperback
cover boys, Sills also managed to wear Jane Greenwood's glittery
costumes without looking too much like Liberace.
</P>
<P>
   The same cannot be said of Bohmer, a round-cheeked actor of
greater emotional delicacy and less natural charisma. He has a
charmingly quiet spark of glee in his eyes and a shimmery, sincere
voice. But he does ask you to take him seriously, which no
Pimpernel, especially one dressed like this, can afford to do.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carmello, a first-rate interpreter of the new school of
cerebral musicals (``Hello Again,'' ``Parade''), gives her heart
and soul to every song she sings. In the case of the cartoonishly
Gallic Marguerite, however, all that's required is her vanity.
Kudisch, a stalwartly handsome man with a forbidding forehead,
plays Chauvelin with committed, as opposed to winking, melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   Though all three principals are in excellent voice, they bring a
taming quality of domesticity to the evening. A few ensemble
numbers, especially those involving the chorus of English
aristocrats making like peacocks, register with an invigorated wit.
But overall, the production has shed its commanding sweep and
energy.
</P>
<P>
   I never thought I would miss that barnlike echo chamber called
the Minskoff, but its vastness served ``Pimpernel'' better than the
cozy Neil Simon does. Being bigger than life is what this show is
about. When Sills, Rachel York and Rex Smith sang the concluding
number of the first act, an earnest trio about deception and trust
called ``The Riddle,'' they did so with an over-the-top fierceness
that gave off real sparks and sent you grinning foolishly into the
lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Bohmer, Ms. Carmello and Kudisch deliver the same song with more
gravity and finesse than their predecessors, and the effect is
close to soporific. Certain shows not only do not deserve respect;
they also suffer from it.
</P>

 &HT;    CLINTON PROJECTS RECORD SURPLUS, BUT U.S. DEBT CONTINUES TO
CLIMB
 &HT;    500&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal government will post a record $115
billion budget surplus this year, President Clinton estimated
Monday, thanks mainly to a booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   Coming on the heels of last year's $69 billion surplus, the
performance for the 1999 fiscal year _ which ends Thursday _ marks
the first time since 1957 that the federal government has balanced
its books two years in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a landmark achievement,'' Clinton told reporters at the
White House. ``It is further proof that we're on the right road to
prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   But behind the rosy talk, the government remains, strictly
speaking, in the red.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called surplus includes payments workers made into the
Social Security program, money that by law cannot be used for other
government programs. Not counting money from Social Security _
which ran a sizable surplus this year _ the government still spent
roughly $4 billion more than it took in, according to the latest
Congressional Budget Office estimates.
</P>
<P>
   And the federal debt piled up during a generation of budget
deficits _ a whopping $5.6 trillion _ continues to grow. Clinton
inherited a $4.4 trillion debt when he took office in 1993; the
government hadn't been in the black since 1969.
</P>
<P>
   The debt is projected to continue rising to as much as $5.7
trillion next year.
</P>
<P>
   It's an expensive problem. Servicing the debt is one of the
largest single expenses in the federal budget. It cost taxpayers
roughly $235 billion in interest payments this year alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington is not awash in excess cash,'' said Robert Bixby,
policy director for the Concord Coalition, a Washington think tank
focused on budget issues. ``They still have a way to go before they
can balance the budget without getting into the Social Security
surplus.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton isn't the only one touting good fiscal times.
Congressional Republicans said Monday that the surplus provided
more evidence to support their call for tax cuts. Clinton last week
vetoed a $792 billion GOP tax cut package, claiming that the plan
would put future budgets at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Pushed by one of the strongest economic booms in history, the
government balance sheet has been moving in the right direction
since Clinton took office.
</P>
<P>
   The year before that, the budget deficit hit a record $290
billion. More red ink was projected.
</P>
<P>
   This year's numbers are decidedly better, owing to continuing
growth in an economy that has expanded by 40 percent since Clinton
first took office.
</P>
<P>
   With unemployment down and more Americans working than ever
before, income tax receipts are up, as are the fees and taxes that
businesses pay on their swelling profits and expanding activities.
</P>
<P>
   Government spending continues to increase. Spending this year
alone is up some $55 billion over 1998 levels _ but revenues grew
faster.
</P>
<P>
   The result: this year the government took in roughly $115
billion more than it spent_ a turnaround of $404 billion as
compared with the 1992 ledger.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's unquestionably good news for the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``By balancing the budget, we put in motion a virtuous cycle of
budget surpluses, low interest rates and low unemployment,''
Clinton said. ``For business, this makes it easier to invest, to
create jobs, wealth and opportunity. And for working people, lower
interest rates makes it easier to own a home, afford a car, send a
child to college.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight years into the economic expansion, however, the deficit
dragon has yet to be slain.
</P>
<P>
   As Congress views budget matters, folding Social Security into
the overall calculus is mixing apples and oranges.
</P>
<P>
   The distinction goes beyond accounting jargon.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Social Security is essentially a government-run
insurance program, providing retirement payments to workers who pay
premiums during the years they're employed. Congress treats that
differently from taxes paid to fund government programs such as
defense, highways, education or foreign affairs. Lawmakers have
erected something of a fiscal firewall between Social Security and
other government programs.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Social Security program will take in an estimated
$125 billion more in premiums than it will pay out in retirement
checks, according to a CBO report issued Sept. 14.
</P>
<P>
   That's the source of the surplus Clinton crowed about on Monday.
Strip it out and the budget remains well into deficit territory.
</P>
<P>
   The White House Office of Management and Budget differs slightly
with the CBO on such estimates. Using CBO numbers, however, the
government remains $4 billion in deficit this year, if the Social
Security surplus isn't included.
</P>
<P>
   That money is being counted on to fund a rising tide of Social
Security benefit checks once the Baby Boomer generation begins
retiring en masse a dozen years from now.
</P>
<P>
   ``That Social Security surplus is really supposed to be used
like a savings account,'' said Bixby. ``We shouldn't be using it to
pay our grocery bills.''

TEXAS LOBBYIST SAYS HE CALLED GUARD ON BUSH'S BEHALF 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
and STEVE OLAFSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Austin lobbyist Ben Barnes said Monday that as
speaker of the Texas House more than 30 years ago, he recommended
George W. Bush for a pilot's position in the Texas Air National
Guard at the request of a Bush family friend.
</P>
<P>
   But Barnes, in a statement issued by his lawyer, said he was not
contacted by a member of the Bush family and had ``no knowledge''
that either the future governor or his father, former President
Bush, who was then a congressman from Houston, knew of his
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   The question of whether Gov. Bush received preferential
treatment in securing a National Guard spot to avoid going to
Vietnam during the Southeast Asian conflict has surfaced in Bush's
presidential race. The governor joined the Guard in 1968, at the
height of the war, and served until 1973 as an F-102 pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has repeatedly denied that he joined the Guard to avoid the
draft or that his family intervened on his behalf at a time when
many young men seeking Guard slots in Texas found long waiting
lists.
</P>
<P>
   He repeated those denials Monday during an appearance in
Brazoria County to announce a land conservation initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if Ben Barnes did or not, but he was not asked by
me or my dad,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also noted that Houston oilman Sidney A. Adger, the Bush
family friend whom Barnes said contacted him, is dead.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes' role in helping Bush was raised in a federal lawsuit
filed against Gtech, the company that operates the Texas Lottery,
by former lottery director Lawrence Littwin.
</P>
<P>
   Littwin, who was dismissed as lottery director in 1997, contends
Gtech, for whom Barnes used to lobby, was responsible for his
firing. And, according to court records, Littwin's lawyers wanted
to question Barnes about whether Gtech was allowed to keep its
lucrative state contract in exchange for Barnes' silence about
helping Bush get into the Guard.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, a former Democratic Texas House speaker and lieutenant
governor who was once considered presidential material himself
until he lost a 1972 race for governor, was questioned by lawyers
in the Littwin-Gtech suit for more than five hours at his Austin
office Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes did not speak with reporters afterward, but his lawyer,
Charles Burton, issued a written statement on Barnes' behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Burton said Barnes answered all the questions in the deposition
but could not discuss his answers because of a federal judge's
confidentiality order. But, he added, the order did not prevent
Barnes from ``setting the media record straight on events occurring
more than 30 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Burton's statement, Barnes was ``contacted by Sid
Adger and asked to recommend George W. Bush for a pilot position
with the Air National Guard. Barnes called General Rose and did
so.''
</P>
<P>
   Brig. Gen. James Rose, who also has since died, was in charge of
the Air National Guard at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither congressman Bush nor any other member of the Bush
family asked Barnes' help,'' Burton's statement continued. ``Barnes
has no knowledge that Governor Bush or President Bush knew of
Barnes' recommendation.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer also said that Barnes met with Don Evans, a longtime
friend of the governor and his chief presidential fund-raiser, and
told him of Adger's request in September 1998, when the governor
was running for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush wrote Barnes a note thanking him for his candor
in acknowledging that Barnes received no call from any member of
the Bush family,'' the statement added.
</P>
<P>
   Evans told The Associated Press that he met with Barnes on his
own initiative, without informing Bush in advance. At the time,
Evans was Bush's gubernatorial campaign chairman and was concerned
only about any potential effect on the re-election race.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are relying on whether a man who is deceased tried to
help, and I can just tell you from my perspective, I never asked
for (and) I don't believe I received any special treatment,'' Bush
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Any allegation that my dad asked for special favors
is simply not true. The former president of the United States has
said that he in no way, shape or form helped me get into the Guard,
and I didn't ask anybody to help me get in the Guard either.''
</P>
<P>
   Any accusations to the contrary are ``just politics,'' he said.

BOSTON'S FORTUNES SOARING, STUDY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Growing diversity in Boston's population has coincided
with an economic renaissance that has lifted the fortunes of its
black and white populations, according to a study released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, the Boston area was predominantly a white community,
with a small black population. Three decades later, after a period
in which the city was torn apart by a controversy over race and
busing, the minority population in the Boston area has jumped to 41
percent amid a historic influx of immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Poverty, housing shortages, and wage disparities continue to
affect many of the city's minority residents, according to a report
released Monday by Barry Bluestone, professor of political economy
at Northeastern University, and Mary Huff Stevenson, professor of
economics at the University of Massachusetts at Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But with unemployment at new lows amid a high-tech and financial
services boom, the report found that members of minority groups in
Boston, particularly blacks, have fared much better than those in
other large US cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is stunning about Boston is how quickly this history of
decline and distress has been reversed,'' Bluestone and Stevenson
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is rare to find the wholesale deprivation and hopelessness
that describe large parts of Detroit, Gary, Philadelphia, Los
Angeles, or Chicago,'' the authors said.
</P>
<P>
   The study was released at an economic summit on the Boston
campus of Northeastern University as US Labor Secretary Alexis
Herman stressed the need to close the yawning wage gap that exists
between college-educated workers and high school graduates.
</P>
<P>
   College graduates once earned about 30 percent more than those
without a degree, who tend to be disproportionately drawn from
minority groups. That gap has widened to 71 percent ``and it is
growing,'' said Herman, who attended the summit with US Senator
Edward M. Kennedy and Mayor Thomas M. Menino.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is particularly acute in cities such as Boston that
are enjoying an economic boom due to a large presence of
knowledge-based industries, she said. ``We don't have a worker
shortage in this country, but we do have a skills shortage.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such problems, Boston fared better than many other
metropolitan areas. Its economic renaissance has lifted the
fortunes of some minority residents, according to the five-year
economic study, ``Greater Boston in Transition,'' which was based
on surveys of 128,000 families.
</P>
<P>
   The metropolitan area had the fastest-growing family income
during the 1980s, and the income gains ``have not been restricted
to white families,'' the study noted. For example, household
incomes of blacks rose 40.2 percent during the decade, the fastest
of any urban black population in the United States, according to a
1996 report cited in study released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been absolutely an amazing turnaround, and it has
turned around so fast,'' Bluestone said.
</P>
<P>
   Poverty is high in Boston, with the city ranking 32d among US
cities. But less than a quarter of the city's black population is
in poverty, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   What has kept overall poverty high in Boston is the fact that a
third of Hispanic and Asian residents fall below the poverty line,
the report said. White poverty is 14 percent in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Bluestone also said that one of the most surprising results of
the study was that the labor participation rate among blacks,
whites, and Hispanics is the same. But, he added, ``we still have
large earnings gaps.''
</P>
<P>
   High poverty rates, low wages, and soaring housing costs have
been particularly burdensome for new immigrants, which have
accounted for much of the sharp rise in the city's minority
population. Bluestone said one family's rents in a Roxbury
apartment rose from $450 a month to $800 in three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the standards of the countries they left, they are doing
well,'' the study said. ``By the standards of their newly adopted
home, they are impoverished.''

FOR ADULTS, A FRISSON: TV SHOWS FOR GROWN-UPS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ ``Hallelujah! Forty-year-olds are sexy!''
</P>
<P>
   The exuberance of Stuart Bloomberg, co-chairman of the ABC
Entertainment Group, is probably overstated. After all, the new
series he was talking about, ``Once and Again,'' about divorced
middle-aged people who find one another, appeared last week on
television only for the first time as the new season began.
</P>
<P>
   But what seemed evident, at least early on, was that the
overabundance of teen-age and ``let's-share-an-apartment in New
York'' television shows was being challenged by some grown-up
series that seek to appeal to _ perish the thought _ viewers over
30.
</P>
<P>
   In their initial week, such series as ABC's ``Once and Again''
as well as NBC's ``West Wing,'' about the White House staff, and
CBS's ``Judging Amy,'' starring Amy Brenneman (``N.Y.P.D. Blue'')
as a judge who is also dealing with her bossy mother (Tyne Daly),
have lured large television audiences despite the absence of the
kind of 20-something angst that dominates many shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is obviously a hunger on the part of audiences that
might have felt ignored,'' said Ed Zwick, who created ``Once and
Again'' with his partner, Marshall Herskovitz. The critically
acclaimed show gave ABC its highest rated drama premiere since
1995, when Steven Bochco's ``Murder One'' began.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Moonves, president and chief executive of CBS Television,
put it another way. ``The fascination with youth, as everything on
network television, is probably overdone this season,'' he said.
``And some of the shows that appeal to baby boomers suddenly have a
great deal more appeal than Madison Avenue first thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Moonves' network deliberately courts older viewers, giving it
often hefty ratings. But advertisers, seeking youth audiences, have
not been as enthusiastic as viewers in seeking out such CBS shows.
``We're going a different road,'' Moonves conceded. ``The shows
that are glorifying the 18-year-old will cancel each other out and
will not appeal to a broad enough audience to work on network
television. They're fine for niche programming.''
</P>
<P>
   Even creators of some of the more successful new shows appealing
to adults were cautious about the early results. ``We've been on a
first date, and we're looking forward to a second date,'' said
Aaron Sorkin, creator of ``The West Wing,'' whose audience ``skewed
fairly old,'' according to Variety and was especially popular in
larger markets like New York and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But Sorkin said: ``I'd be very cautious about calling this an
early success. It's a surprise, a terrific surprise. For me, I'm
always a little surprised when someone other than my mother and
father watch one of my shows.'' (The show's premiere drew 16.9
million viewers.)
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not all the new series appealing to older audiences
fared as well as ``Once and Again'' and ``The West Wing.'' Some of
the initial disappointments included Fox's cutting-edge series
``Action,'' about an out-of-control Hollywood producer, ABC's ``Oh
Grow Up,'' about men sharing an apartment in Brooklyn, and ABC's
``Mike O'Malley Show,'' about a still-adolescent 30-year-old man
who realizes he has to change his ways.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Berger, executive vice president at International Creative
Management and a television agent, said that while highly
anticipated and well-reviewed shows like ``Once and Again'' and
``West Wing'' were first-rate, it was probably a bit early to make
judgments about the success and failure of the new programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of these and some other shows got off to a good start
because they're well done,'' Berger said. ``But overall, people
were just hungry for new shows, hungry for the new network season.
It's been a long summer and people were ready to get back to seeing
new shows on television.''
</P>
<P>
   But some television executives saw deeper meaning in the notion
that some television series, with older actors, had struck a nerve.
Especially ``Once and Again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wonderful that there's a successful drama out there about
a relationship that's not just the domain of 20-somethings,'' said
Bloomberg, who is 50.
</P>
<P>
   His partner, 40-year-old Lloyd Braun, co-chairman of the ABC
Entertainment Television Group, said: ``This really gives you hope
that there's a broad audience out there who will come to a show
that does break a few of the established rules about what people
will watch. There are people in their 40s, or older, who can be
romantic.''
</P>
<P>
   To executives and writers, the network's near-obsession with
youth shows has threatened to turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy:
As shows aimed at younger audiences proliferate, older audiences
drift off to cable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a certain blindness out here: If something is
successful, everybody tries to copy it,'' said Alan Ball, who wrote
the film ``American Beauty'' and created the ABC series ``Oh Grow
Up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What may be happening now is encouraging,'' he said. ``I'm 42.
I'd rather watch television shows I relate to than shows about
teen-agers, most of whose problems seem insignificant.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said that television's obsession with youth would hardly
disappear anytime soon. ``I have a friend, an actor in his late
30s, who's on a new show and plays the venerable old senior
partner,'' Ball said with a laugh. ``He's not old at all but the
rest of the cast is, like, 17-year-old models. It's absurd.''

   The biggest problem with getting into the routine of daily

are forbidden to talk to top-level editors unless they are spoken
to first. And the New York Post reports that  &UR; Kate &LR;

initial hesitance to make the trip.
</P>

   Brokaw told the Washington Post he was ``surprised'' by his

TEXAN QUESTIONED ON ROLE IN HELPING BUSH JOIN NATIONAL GUARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A former speaker of the Texas House of
Representatives, Ben Barnes, was questioned Monday for more than
five hours in a deposition in which he was expected to discuss his
role in recommending George W. Bush for a pilot's slot in a
National Guard unit during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes did not meet with reporters after the deposition, and one
of his lawyers, Charles Burton, said a confidentiality order
prevented discussion of the deposition. But Burton released a
statement confirming reports that a Houston businessman who was a
friend of the Bush family had asked Barnes, then serving as
speaker, to recommend Bush for a Guard slot. Barnes later called
the general overseeing the Texas Air National Guard. Bush became an
airman in May 1968.
</P>
<P>
   The statement said Barnes was never contacted by anyone in the
Bush family and ``has no knowledge that Gov. Bush or President Bush
knew of Barnes' recommendation.'' Bush, the Texas governor and
Republican presidential front-runner, has for years denied that he
sought to join the Guard to avoid the draft or that he received any
preferential treatment in attaining a slot.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes' deposition was part of a federal lawsuit involving
allegations by a fired director of the Texas Lottery that the
company operating the lottery, Gtech, had been given the state
contract as a payback to Barnes for keeping quiet about Bush and
the Guard. Barnes, whose lawyers deny the accusation, once worked
as a lobbyist for GTech.
</P>
<P>
   The statement said that in September 1998, Barnes relayed
details of his role in 1968 to Donald Evans, the finance director
of the Bush campaign. Afterward, the statement said, Bush wrote
Barnes a note ``thanking him for his candor'' in saying he had not
been called by the Bush family.

CMGI TO GO PUBLIC WITH ALTAVISTA IN JANUARY 
</HEADLINE>

 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CMGI Inc. is planning to take its Wide Web search service
AltaVista public in January.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI chairman David Wetherell talking to reporters in a
conference call Monday about the company's fourth-quarter earnings,
said AltaVista would file for an initial public offering after
CMGI's first quarter, which ends Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI, which invests in up-and-coming Internet firms, completed
its $2.3 billion purchase of a majority stake in AltaVista in
August. The company said then that it wanted eventually to spin the
search engine off as a separate company.
</P>
<P>
   Before selling AltaVista to CMGI, Compaq also had plans to take
the search service public as a way to profit from the Internet
boom.
</P>
<P>
   Besides its AltaVista announcement, the company said it produced
fourth-quarter profits of $452.7 million, largely due to a $661.2
million pretax gain from the sale of GeoCities to Yahoo Inc. for
$2.87 billion in May. CMGI owned 27 percent of GeoCities. Apart
from the GeoCities deal and other one-time gains, CMGI lost $51.4
million for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the GeoCities bounty, CMGI's fourth-quarter revenues
were $53.6 million, up from $25.9 million the year before. Revenues
for the fiscal year were $175.7 million, compared to $81.9 million
in 1998. Total 1999 net income was $476.2 million, compared with
$31.9 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, CMGI announced it would acquire Palo Alto,
Calif.-based 1stUp.com, which provides free advertising-supported
Internet access to consumers, in a stock-swap transaction. No
further details of the deal were released.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI shares jumped 8 5/16, or 9.8 percent, to 93 1/8, and the
stock rose as high as 95 after the close of markets. CMGI is based
in Andover, Mass.

MCCAIN, DECLARING RUN, EMPHASIZES HIS INDEPENDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ Once a prisoner of war and now a senator, John
McCain promised Monday to run for president with dignity and to
take the government back from the special interests and big-dollar
donors who now exert undue influence on Congress and the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's announcement, which came as no surprise to anyone who
has seen him campaigning furiously this year in the Granite State,
took swipes at President Clinton, Congress and Texas Governor
George W. Bush, the Republican frontrunner. At bottom, however, he
underscored his independence, forged, he said, during five and a
half years as a POW in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is because I owe America more than she has ever owed me
that I am a candidate for president of the United States,'' he said
from the bandstand in Greeley Park before about 500 friends and
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, which holds the first-in-the-nation primary,
McCain has been making steady progress all year, with most polls
showing him gathering support as an alternative to Bush. The
campaign is organized in every county and in 75 percent of the
towns so far. While McCain has targeted veterans for support, he
also has developed a following among people who care about
overhauling the campaign finance system, and he draws from both
parties as well as Independents.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got great potential,'' said Steve Duprey, chairman of the
Republican Party here. ``This is a fabulous turnout, he's working
the state hard.''
</P>
<P>
   His campaign has long stressed McCain's life story, particularly
the chapter in which the daring young Navy pilot was shot down over
Hanoi in 1967 while on a bombing mission. McCain opened his
announcement tour Monday at his alma mater, the Naval Academy in
Annapolis speaking to 4,000 midshipmen.
</P>
<P>
   Later in Nashua, McCain, 63, told a crowd that he would protect
Social Security, cut taxes, eliminate pork-barrel spending, create
a nationwide school voucher test program, and improve students'
access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said money intended to go toward Social Security would
only be used for Social Security in his administration. He said he
would use 60 percent of the current surplus to save the retirement
program during his first year in office.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has long championed campaign finance legislation in
Congress and Monday he said he would give tax cuts to ``working men
and women,'' not the special interests that invest in members of
Congress. And he said he would refuse to sign any pork barrel
spending bill that crosses his desk.
</P>
<P>
   On education, McCain said he wants to send 90 percent of all
federal education dollars to classrooms, rather than to government
bureaucrats. He said all teachers should be paid based on merit,
and they should be tested periodically for competence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason on earth a good teacher should be paid less
than a bad Senator,'' McCain said, in an appearance that his
campaign filmed for use in future television ads.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, in South Carolina, McCain plans to propose paying for a
three-year demonstration of school vouchers -- to help students pay
for private or parochial school -- by canceling federal subsidies
for ethanol, sugar, gas and oil producers.
</P>
<P>
   On defense matters, McCain said Clinton failed the country by
weakening its defenses, and that both parties in Congress wasted
precious money on unneeded weapons systems and other pork barrel
projects while some enlisted personnel continue to live on food
stamps.
</P>
<P>
   And, for the first time, he was sharply critical of Bush, the
leader of the Republican pack who has made light of his
inexperience in foreign affairs. Until now, McCain has taken pains
to avoid criticizing him. But McCain's advisers believe the
senator, more than any other candidate, has a rich life experience
that gives him the ability to make life and death decisions on
sending troops abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``If America is to lead, then America's leader must be prepared
for that challenge,'' said McCain, the son and grandson of
admirals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There comes a time when our nation's leader can no longer rely
on briefing books and talking points, when the experts and the
advisors have all weighed in, when the sum total of one's life
becomes the foundation from which he or she makes the decisions
that determine the future of our democracy,'' he said. ``For no
matter how many others are involved in the decision, the president
is a lonely man in a dark room when the casualty reports come in.''

FIDELITY TURNS TO LYCOS TO SPIFF UP ONLINE INVESTING ARM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a bold move that reflects a growing trend among
Web-based brokerages to offer information on just about everything
under the sun, Fidelity Investments has given its burgeoning online
investing service a makeover through an alliance with Lycos Inc.,
the Internet portal company.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity, the nation's biggest mutual fund firm, joins a pack of
competitors in betting that cyberinvestors want sports scores and
weather reports as well as stock quotes and financial data.
</P>
<P>
   Under a deal announced Monday, Fidelity customers can use Lycos
to create personalized Web pages that display their investment
portfolios alongside links to Web sites on everything from health
and travel to sports and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have long been able to trade stocks on line at
Fidelity, whose discount brokerage, which includes a Web-based
unit, is the nation's second largest.
</P>
<P>
   But starting next month, investors can use their Lycos-fashioned
pages to trade stocks directly from their Fidelity accounts while
keeping tabs on, for example, the latest hurricane. The all-in-one
page, aimed at investors who trade often, makes Fidelity the latest
electronic bazaar, with a potpourri of information and data. Lycos'
dozens of directories have links to scores of Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   But Fidelity's revamped Web brokerage, now called Powerstreet,
comes at a time of fierce competition for the pockets of a trader
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity is going head-to-head with Charles Schwab and Co.,
which in May launched a similar service with Excite, a leading
Internet portal that competes with Lycos, of Waltham, Mass. ETrade
Group Inc., an online-only brokerage, also offers personalized
investor pages.
</P>
<P>
   The fast-changing world of on-line investing has jolted
traditional Wall Street brokerages and forced other financial
services firms to come up with new strategies fast.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity's ``product is clearly designed to encourage active
trading, and is targeted to what investors are likely to look like
in the future,'' said James Lowell, editor of Fidelity Investor, an
independent newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Lured by the do-it-yourself ethic, bargain-basement trading
prices, and a record bull stock market, about 12.5 percent of all
US investors now buy and sell stocks on line _ a figure expected to
quadruple in the next two years. The trend has brought products and
services once reserved for professionals into the homes of ordinary
investors and spawned a sub-culture that is increasingly
mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   At Fidelity, customers now conduct nearly four in five stock
trades through the firm's online brokerage. Fidelity is most
interested in keeping its active traders _ those who buy and sell
securities at least 36 times a year _ on board.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web is becoming more central to the way we serve our
customers,'' said Gary Burkhead, who heads Fidelity's brokerage
services, adding that the company was making ``very major
investments'' to develop its Internet capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Kobren, who publishes the independent Fidelity Insight
newsletter, speculated that Fidelity was less able to attract
active traders than Web-only brokerages such as ETrade because of
its image as a mainstream fund firm. By keeping the Fidelity name
off Powerstreet, he said, the firm might draw new customers more
easily.
</P>
<P>
   Kobren also said privately held Fidelity might be tempted to one
day spin off its online brokerage as a publicly traded company.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity and Lycos declined to discuss the financial terms of
their deal. Fidelity did not say when it would start charging
customers for the Lycos service, which for now is free.
</P>
<P>
   Longer term, the arrangement will benefit Lycos, now the
third-largest portal service, by leading scores of wealthy Fidelity
investors to Lycos' sites and advertising. Fidelity, whose mutual
fund assets total $849 billion, and whose brokerage assets are
around $455 billion, will include Lycos' name and logo in a blitz
of advertising for Powerstreet.
</P>
<P>
   Powerstreet, which is accessible through Fidelity's Web site,
fidelity.com, will offer free Nasdaq Level 2 quotes _ live buy and
sell prices, and a hot commodity for individual investors _ next
month. It will also provide customers access to CBS'
Marketwatch.com, a financial Web site. Fidelity already provides
corporate research from Lehman Brothers, the investment bank.

ARIZONA SEEKS A `HIRED GUN' TO TREAT KILLER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KIM COBB 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The state of Arizona has been looking for a ``hired gun'' for
more than six months _ a physician or nurse willing to medicate a
mentally ill prisoner aggressively enough to make him competent to
face execution.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody at the Arizona State Hospital in Phoenix is willing to do
it. They have agreed to medicate 42-year-old Claude Eric Maturana
only enough to keep him from harming himself, forcing the state
hospital's top executive to look for a contract worker to do what
his own employees will not.
</P>
<P>
   If the hospital does not find someone to treat Maturana toward
his ultimate death, the Arizona attorney general's office is
prepared to file contempt of court charges against the institution,
which may force a choice between medical ethics or the law.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that it's unconstitutional to
execute someone so mentally ill that he is incompetent to
understand the circumstances of his punishment. But legal and
medical observers think the Arizona conundrum may be the case that
forces the Supreme Court to directly address whether the state can
forcibly medicate someone to make them competent.
</P>
<P>
   Maturana was sentenced to die in 1992 for the grisly murder of a
16-year-old boy two years before. Prosecutors said Maturana and an
accomplice suspected young Glen Estes had stolen an auto part from
Maturana.
</P>
<P>
   They drove their victim into the desert, shot him repeatedly and
tried to decapitate him before leaving his body floating in a
rancher's water tank.
</P>
<P>
   Maturana had been paroled from a Texas prison just five months
before, having served time for burglary and aggravated assault.
</P>
<P>
   Maturana was not yet scheduled for execution but had run out of
appeals early this year when his most recent attorney convinced a
superior court judge that her client was schizophrenic and
therefore incompetent to face execution. Attorney Carla Ryan, who
based her argument on the evaluations of two court-appointed
doctors, said her client spoke so much gibberish she couldn't
communicate with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's shocking to me that nobody ever raised this before I got
on the case,'' Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling temporarily bought Maturana some time, since the U.S.
Supreme Court ruled in 1986 that a condemned prisoner must be
stable enough to understand that he is going to die for his crime.
Maturana was ordered to the care of the Arizona State Hospital in
February to be ``restored to competence.''
</P>
<P>
   But the state hospital's medical staff dug in their heels,
claiming treatment that leads to execution is a violation of
medical ethics.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital chief executive Jack Silver advertised twice in Arizona
for someone to treat Maturana, but didn't get a single response. He
said the state hospital also mailed out individual letters to more
than 1,400 licensed psychiatrists and nurse practitioners in
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one wanted the job. He has now expanded the search
nationally. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``An individual's opinion on capital punishment is the personal
moral decision of the individual,'' states AMA ethical policy. ``A
physician, as a member of a profession dedicated to preserving life
when there is hope of doing so, should not be a participant in a
legally authorized execution.''
</P>
<P>
   Under that umbrella, AMA ethical policy specifically forbids
treating a prisoner to restore mental competency unless the
prisoner's sentence has already been commuted to life.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Arizona Attorney General's office has threatened to
file contempt of court charges against the state hospital
physicians for failing to comply with the judge's orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, if it gets to that point,'' said Silver, ``the
question becomes: `Do ethics supersede law or does law supersede
ethics?'''
</P>
<P>
   Paul McMurdie, the attorney general's criminal appeals section
chief, says it bothers him that Maturana's is being discussed as a
possible test case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it does, because I think he's faking it,'' McMurdie said.
``I think there should be a better case to challenge ... the whole
debate over forced medication. But this doesn't seem to be the
case, because I think he's faking it.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors believe Maturana saves his ``crazy'' behavior for
the psychologists, but stops acting when conversing with
corrections officers. ``He's totally oriented to time, place, and
reality,'' McMurdie said. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Ryan said records she submitted in Superior Court indicate
Maturana has had symptoms of mental illness for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not one medical expert who disagrees'' that Maturana
is incompetent, Ryan said. McMurdie tried unsuccessfully to force a
rehearing on the question of Maturana's competency, based on the
affidavits of two young corrections officers ``who have no mental
health training at all,'' Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   Both corrections officers were prepared to testify they'd had a
``normal'' conversation with Maturana, she said, but the symptoms
of schizophrenia can come and go.
</P>
<P>
   Medical experts say people suffering from schizophrenia
sometimes experience delusions and hallucinations, alteration of
the senses, and an inability to sort incoming sensations and
respond to them appropriately. The delusions can cause people to
believe they are being plotted against, and about three-fourths of
all people with schizophrenia will hear voices.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thinks the CIA comes to take him to do assassinations,''
Ryan said of her client. ``At times he thinks there's some kind of
machinery the Department of Corrections has implanted in him so he
can talk to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Maturana's first attorney had questions about Maturana's mental
status at the time of his trial and arranged for court-ordered
psychiatric testing. Based on that evaluation, the presiding judge
found Maturana competent to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   But the pretrial competency report prepared by Tucson
psychologist Todd Flynn in 1991 notes that in spite of Maturana's
claims even then to hallucinations, hearing voices, and apparent
suicide attempts, the supervising physician was not ready to
believe him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could believe (the) patient's claim of
hallucinations, but his thought processes are so fluent and clear
... that it is hard for me to believe it,'' wrote a physician who
observed Maturana in the Pima County Jail.
</P>
<P>
   Maturana's mental state at the time the crime was committed is
not being challenged.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1986, the Supreme Court used the case of a convicted
Florida killer to rule that a mentally incompetent inmate cannot be
executed, establishing guidelines the states must follow in
evaluating sanity.
</P>
<P>
   Alvin Bernard Ford was sentenced to death in 1975 for killing a
Fort Lauderdale, Fla., police officer during an armed robbery. His
attorneys said the stay on death row caused him to lose his mind _
he claimed to talk to space aliens.
</P>
<P>
   Ford was ultimately ruled competent, after the state of Florida
followed the guidelines for hearing that issue set out by the
Supreme Court. He died in 1991, still on Florida's death row, of
complications from respiratory problems.
</P>
<P>
   The high court's ruling in the Ford case does not require a
prisoner to be completely free of mental illness to be eligible for
execution. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``But you have to be aware you committed a crime, you have to
be aware you've been sentenced to death and you have to be aware
that when the sentence is imposed you're going to die,'' explained
state hospital administrator Silver.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a fairly low standard.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver is sympathetic to his staff's objections and says he
fully understands the dilemma for a medical professional, but
thinks there may be a window through which someone can treat
Maturana to a level of legal competency
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the determinations they're going to have to make is
whether or not they think he has a mental illness and whether he's
suffering &UR; ( &LR; as a result of) that mental illness,'' Silver said. The
American Medical Association has ruled that a physician has a duty
to treat an incompetent prisoner if he ``is undergoing extreme
suffering as a result of psychosis or any other illness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are experts in determining whether or not people suffer
from mental illness, what would be effective, and whether or not
that individual is in pain or discomfort,'' Silver said. ``I think
there can be disagreements, differences of opinions between
psychiatrists as well.''
</P>
<P>
   But Silver said he is not ``fishing'' for a medical practitioner
who is willing to say Maturana is suffering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a responsibility as the director of the hospital to
uphold the law, and the law says we have a responsibility to
provide treatment for this individual,'' Silver said.

QUAYLE EXIT FIRMS UP GOP RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Five months before a single vote is cast in a
presidential caucus or primary, the Republican race has taken on
the look of spring _ the political season of settling and sorting
that follows the crucial winter primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Four candidates have dropped out, including former Vice
President Dan Quayle Monday, while George W. Bush's $55 million war
chest has led some to consider his nomination inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``In lieu of caucuses and primaries, the straw polls, media
appearances and financial filing reports are winnowing the field,''
New Hampshire Republican Party chairman Stephen Duprey said Monday.
``Four or five candidates are cut before we even get to a vote.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's not over yet, Duprey said. The contest now enters a new
phase, the ``primary within a primary'' among the candidates to
survive the next few months and become the leading alternative to
Bush. The clash between the remaining eight Republicans will become
much more intense, with negative advertisements, debates and
scrutiny of the issues.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the race has been notable for Bush's strength and the
remarkably early rush to the exit door by some GOP hopefuls. That
is a result of the compressed primary schedule that could mean the
nomination will be sealed within a few weeks of the vote in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Unless a candidate has piled up money this year, there probably
will be no time to collect the funds next year necessary to be
competitive, even if someone pulls a stunning upset in Iowa or New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, candidates who are failing to collect much money now view
their campaigns as hopeless and are either dropping from the race
or seeking a new political party or base for their ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Bush has benefited from being the popular choice
in a crowded field of about dozen candidates. But as more
candidates drop out, the shrinking field is likely to produce one
or two significant alternatives to Bush. At that point, anti-Bush
sentiment might coalesce around one candidate, who then might rise
quickly in the national polls and become a real competitor to the
Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Senator John McCain of Arizona, who has been
running for president all year but formally kicked off his campaign
Monday in New Hampshire, hopes to benefit from a backlash against
Bush's fund-raising prowess by highlighting the issue of campaign
finance.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is expected to report this week that he has collected $55
million, well on his way to meeting predictions that he will have
between $75 million and $100 million to spend during the primaries.
To put that in perspective, candidates are prohibited from spending
more than $33.5 million during the primaries on direct campaign
costs if they take federal matching funds, not including expenses
for fund-raising and legal bills.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, by rejecting the matching funds, could have three or four
times as much money as his closest competitors, with the exception
of Steve Forbes. The multimillionaire publisher is using mostly his
own funds and is the only candidate aside from Bush who is
rejecting the federal funds and thus avoiding the spending cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Republican primary for the presidency is unprecedented,''
Quayle said Monday in Phoenix while announcing he is dropping out
of the race. ``Never before have we had a Republican primary like
we have today. The front-runner apparently will have up to $100
million to spend in the primary.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is where the GOP race stands. The four candidates who have
dropped out are Quayle, Representative John Kasich of Ohio, former
Tennessee Governor Lamar Alexander and Senator Bob Smith of New
Hampshire, who is making a longshot independent bid. A fifth
candidate, Patrick J. Buchanan, is expected to leave the GOP and
seek the Reform Party nomination.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves as Bush's competitors McCain, Forbes, former Red
Cross president and cabinet secretary Elizabeth Dole, former Reagan
aide Gary Bauer, Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah and talk-show host
Alan Keyes. The latest CNN poll shows Bush with 53 percent, and
each of the other candidates in the single digits. Ironically,
Quayle was in second place in that poll with 9 percent, but he said
he lagged too far behind in the money race to compete.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best way to think about the presidential race is to
throw out the old perception that the campaign begins in January,
picks up steam with the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary and
then is decided with the Southern states and Super Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The new way to look at the contest, analysts said, is to view
the first phase as the fund-raising race, which Bush clearly is
winning. The next phase is the fight for the support of political
activists, symbolized by last month's straw vote in Iowa, which
Bush won handily. While the straw vote was criticized as a
meaningless, undemocratic affair, it clearly played a role in the
decisions by Alexander and Quayle to drop out. Both men performed
far below expectations in a state where they had invested much time
and money.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming phase, the remaining candidates will fight to
emerge as the alternative to Bush. To do this, several competitors
are hoping the race will focus on which candidate will emerge as
the ``true conservative,'' with an emphasis on tax cuts, opposition
to abortion and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the race is expected to be over within weeks of the
New Hampshire primary, possibly by March 7 when 11 states hold
their primaries, including delegate-rich California.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, meanwhile, is banking on support from women and younger
voters to bolster her bid. But in the CNN poll released Monday,
Dole had dropped to 8 percent from 17 percent in March. McCain,
Forbes and Buchanan were tied with 5 percent, Keyes had 3 percent,
and Bauer and Hatch had 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   All of the candidates, meanwhile, are waiting for Bush to
stumble. The GOP field is beginning to harp on Bush for ducking
some events, with Forbes noting over the weekend that the Texas
governor skipped a California gathering of candidates to attend the
Ryder Cup in Brookline, Mass. In the coming days, several campaigns
are expected to put pressure on Bush to attend a series of New
Hampshire debates and town meetings, the first of which is
scheduled for later this month.

EUROPEAN COURT REJECTS BRITAIN'S BAN ON GAYS IN THE MILITARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The European Court of Human Rights declared Monday that
Britain's longstanding ban on homosexuals in the military was a
violation of the basic human right to privacy.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous decision by the European court, based in
Strasbourg, France, means that Britain will almost certainly be
forced to allow openly gay men and women into the military for the
first time, human-rights lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politically the government, which has made human rights part
of its manifesto, cannot be seen to be ignoring the policy of the
European court,'' said Di Luping, a lawyer for Liberty, a
human-rights organization. Ms. Luping represented two of the four
people who took their case to the European court after they were
discharged from the military when their homosexuality was
discovered.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Ministry, which responded to the legalization of
homosexuality in Britain some 30 years ago by forbidding gay men
and lesbians to serve in the armed forces, said that as a result of
the ruling, it would halt pending disciplinary cases involving
military personnel suspected of being gay. But beyond that, it said
the government would have to review the decision and decide how to
proceed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This government, like all governments, has to accept the
rulings of the European Court of Human Rights,'' said the defense
secretary, Lord Robertson. ``The detail of this complex judgment
and the practical implications are presently being studied. We will
be looking at it quickly, thoroughly, and making our recommendation
speedily.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the ban on homosexuals in the military was put into
effect, at least 600 gay men and lesbians, by official count _ but
possibly thousands more _ have been discharged unfairly because of
their sexuality, said Steve Johnston, chairman of Rank Outsiders, a
support group for gay members of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who serve or who elect to serve their country,'' he
said, ``do so with the commitment that the ultimate sacrifice might
be to give up their lives for their country. They don't join the
navy or the army or the air force to find same-sex partners.''
</P>
<P>
   The case before the European court, which serves as a court of
last resort for Europeans, much as the Supreme Court does for
Americans, concerned four people: Ms. Luping's clients and two
others. All were dismissed from the military in the mid-1990s after
their homosexuality was disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Graeme Grady, an intelligence officer with the Royal Air Force
who was married and the father of two children, was discovered
going to a counseling group for gay married men. Jeanette Smith, an
air force nurse, was dismissed after her relationship with a
civilian woman was revealed by an anonymous tip. Duncan
Lustig-Prean was a supply officer on a naval ship whose superior
officer received an anonymous letter alleging that he was gay. And
John Beckett, a weapons engineer mechanic in the navy, confessed
his homosexuality to the chaplain on his ship.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with glowing reports from superior officers about their
conduct and professionalism, the four appealed the dismissals to
the British courts, but their applications were rejected. In 1996,
they took their cases to the European court.
</P>
<P>
   Defending its policy in Strasbourg, the British government
argued that the presence of gay men and lesbians in the military
depressed morale, incited anti-gay prejudice and disrupted people's
ability to do their jobs. It pointed to a survey it conducted in
1996 in which a preponderance of members of the armed services
polled said they did not want to serve with homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has been a hotly contested one in Britain, and the
Defense Ministry has always made clear that it believes, as its
guidelines say, that homosexuality is incompatible with military
service.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not only because of the close physical conditions in
which personnel often have to live and work, but also because
homosexual behavior can cause offense, polarize relationships,
induce ill-discipline and as a consequence, damage morale and unit
effectiveness,'' the guidelines say.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But the court, composed of judges from Britain, Cyprus, France,
Lithuania, Austria, Norway and Albania, was not convinced. In a 7-0
judgment, it ruled that the Defense Ministry had violated Article 8
of the European Convention on Human Rights, which says that
``everyone has the right to respect for his private and family
life, his home and his correspondence.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain has no American-style bill of rights or written
constitution, but along with 40 other countries, it has signed the
European Convention on Human Rights, which obliges it to abide by
the court's rulings, even to the extent of changing its laws if
necessary. Previous cases have forced Britain to end corporal
punishment in state schools and to give greater rights to prisoners
and people suspected of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   In this case the European court found the investigations of the
applicants' sexuality, which included searches of their possessions
and detailed interrogations of them and others by military police
officers about specific and highly personal aspects of their sexual
practices, to be particularly intrusive. The court said this
``constituted a direct interference with the applicants' right to
respect their private lives.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Nor was the court swayed by the Defense Ministry's contention
that members of the armed forces do not want to serve with
homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``These negative attitudes cannot, of themselves, be considered
by the court to amount to sufficient justification for the
interference with the applicants' rights outlined above, any more
than similar negative attitudes toward those of a different race,
origin or color,'' the ruling said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The four people whose cases were the subject of Monday's ruling
said they were gratified by the result, and hope the Defense
Ministry will lift the ban on homosexuals as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm absolutely thrilled with the decision,'' Ms. Smith told
Sky News, comparing the effort to keep gay men and lesbians out of
the military to earlier efforts to ban people from other groups.
``They weren't happy when women joined the forces, or ethnic
minorities and blacks and different religious groups. I can't see
why we can't be accepted in, either.''

 By CATHY HORYN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ With some pride, British fashion designers used to be
the most commercially inept in the world. They were too wayward and
eccentric to do much more than, in effect, blow marvelous soap
bubbles across the water at the French and the Italians, who
instantly exploited their playpen ideas. And even now, one can't
say that John Galliano and Alexander McQueen are bona fide English
successes, since their money comes from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   So there was something very ironic about going to a show last
week in the East End here and seeing a Polish immigrant named
Arkadius Weremczuk, who already is a minor star even though he just
finished design school, pretend to be giving birth on a stage
spotlighted with the logo of his corporate sponsor, Ebel, the Swiss
watchmaker. And Ebel wasn't in it strictly for art's sake. When a
model who had been lying under a sheet for most of the show rose up
and began wobbling like a new lamb _ well, you could see that in
addition to being covered in body paint, she had a wristwatch on.
</P>
<P>
   Ebel wasn't the only company putting its name and money behind
the London spring 2000 collections, which ended on Friday. A lot of
designers had corporate sponsors _ Topshop, Marks &AMP; Spencer _ or at
least they had sacks of corporate goodies to give out. ``Official
deodorant!'' chimed a trio of women in the rain outside the Jasper
Conran show.
</P>
<P>
   What with the roll-on, the logos and the softening rain, it
didn't seem like London at all, but rather the infield of a
Southern stock car raceway fluttering with Coca-Cola banners.
</P>
<P>
   One can argue that British designers need sponsors, because
otherwise many could not afford to have shows. Yet, the presence of
so much corporate swag, as the British put it, seemed to heighten
the banality of many presentations. It's one thing if you are as
boldly original as Hussein Chalayan, who put on one of the best
shows seen  &UR; anywhere &LR;  in the last few years, or as gloriously
nonconformist as Boudicca, which showed laced white leather with
Flash Gordon pantaloons, crash helmets and strangely bulbous
footwear.
</P>
<P>
   Those designers have such an instinctive need to tweak the
Establishment _ which, after all, is what has kept London fashion
swinging for 40 years _ that you can't imagine anything really
affecting them. But for newcomers like Anthony Symonds or even
Elspeth Gibson, who owns a store and has a following, the perky
attempts to make the London collections seem commercially with-it
just had the effect of reducing their shows to nice, homogeneous
balls of clothes.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of the better shows were away from the official tent in
South Kensington, or off the schedule altogether. Preen, which is
designed by Justin Thornton and Thea Bregazzi, cleverly mixed
prissy dotted swiss with its signature ragged leather and caught
the wave for girlish clothes with their baby rompers and puckered
strapless tops. Luella Bartley, a former British Vogue editor, put
across a similar look one night in Notting Hill. Cosmopolitans were
served, people got drunk, and some models pranced around in rompers
and campy versions of ladylike town-and-country shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Smith went to a garden in Chelsea. This was the bookish,
posh England of Lawrence (T.E. and D.H.), with models in Turkish
slippers traipsing about in caftans and crisp men's shirts wrapped
with vivid sarongs. It was a lovely idyll, modern in its
uncomplicated use of the past, and now and then on the soundtrack
there was a drowsy meadow hum of insects and English motorbikes.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Williamson went abroad, too, with a collection he called
Exotikarma. It was neither. A reprise of familiar shapes, like
beaded cashmere shells, long flounced skirts and coin-embellished
tops, it was all colored in a predictable sari palette. Williamson
knows how to put together a cool, worldly mix, but this time it
didn't say ``open sesame.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clements Ribeiro show was disappointing. Colors were fresh _
buttercup, pistachio mixed with chocolate, natural linen spritzed
with big rainbow paillettes. But a program-note promise of ``a more
complex femininity'' yielded blouselike strapless tops and
voluminous halter dresses that might be endearing _ to pregnant
women.
</P>
<P>
   In her notes, Tracey Boyd described a regenerated Eve on a
``fruitful encounter with her sexuality.'' That was just a sly way
of Ms. Boyd having fun. She has a knack for taking fabrics like
lacquered lace and dotted swiss right to the tacky edge, and then
pulling back with something arcane, like a top of tucked white
batiste. Electric pastels amplified the collection's good, clean
sinfulness. And very fruity it was, too.
</P>
<P>
   To say that Burberry looks more Italian than English since
Roberto Menichetti took over the design is to ignore the realities
of a global brand. Menichetti would likely admit to being
obsessive, given how he likes to point out every detail _ from new
plaids in lilac, green and ashy gray to the modern fit of a stretch
raincoat. ``It took 32 fittings to get that coat right,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   All that is wonderful, but it's not what one comes to London
for. Arkadius _ that's how he likes to be called _ left Poland
seven years ago, he said, with nothing but a rucksack. In London,
he met someone who became his benefactor, paying for his tuition at
Central St. Martin's. Isabella Blow, the stylist, discovered him
and made the introduction to Ebel, which, he said, has agreed to
finance him for three years.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the front row at the show was Gary Djanogly, an Ebel
brand manager. It was obvious Djanogly didn't know a lot about a
raw talent like Arkadius' _ the paint-slathered white leather tops,
the bell-bottoms ballooning out with bean-bag stuffing, or what it
means, as the designer said, ``to give birth to my own self.'' And
when asked if he was aware of the risks involved with supporting a
new designer, Djanogly looked nonplused and said, ``Ask me a
question about geography.''
</P>
<P>
   But he could see that Arkadius generated buzz, the way McQueen
did, and he added, ``We're hoping he's going to be great.''
</P>
<P>
   Fashion is a long-term proposition, and designers should have
the luxury of expressing ideas, especially in their raw vitality.
Five years ago, Chalayan was burying clothes in his backyard, to
see how they'd decay, and not long ago he was designing T-shirts.
He has never made a lot of money.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday night at Sadler's Wells Theater, he sent out a
collection that was as personal and brilliant as it gets. He didn't
look to history books or vintage rags for inspiration. It all came
out of his head. Here were dresses of marigold, sea foam and light
blue cotton, or voile cut closely on top and left to fall in soft,
funnel-like ripples to the knees. Ruffles trickled down the front
of simple chemises, but they looked refined.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the collection was a rare combination of refinement and
childish innocence. At one point, a young boy came out holding a
remote control, which he aimed at a model in a pale plastic cone of
a dress. Slowly the back of her dress opened, like a car port, to
reveal a frisky layer of tulle. Other gestures were more grown-up,
like white chemises printed with the sort of abstract trees Philip
Johnson might sketch from his glass house.
</P>
<P>
   When the show was over, three rounds of applause could not bring
Chalayan out.

 &HT;    Backpacks to backaches: Kids toting moreBy Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Anthony Williamson, 11, likes his nickname: ``Short
Man.''
</P>
<P>
   But the 72-pound sixth grader said his stature works against him
as he hauls an 18-pound backpack from class to class. This year, he
asked his mom for a book bag with wheels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to hurt,'' he said. ``It seemed like a smart
thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   To see beasts of burden, visit a middle school _ where the
children lug around as heavy a load of books as college students.
In a random sample Monday of eight students at Atlanta's Inman
Middle School, the weight of their backpacks ranged from 13 pounds
to a whopping 29 pounds. Five of the bags exceeded health experts'
recommendations that they weigh no more than 10-15 percent of
bodyweight.
</P>
<P>
   The students are prime candidates for aches and pains, experts
say. And although doctors and chiropractors hotly debate the
seriousness of the complaints, the American Academy of Pediatrics
and the American Chiropractic Association have issued warnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got patients, young kids _ in second and third grade _
complaining of back and neck problems,'' said Steven Katz, a
chiropractor. ``And I link it back to those doggone backpacks.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission estimates children
make up 64 percent of all patients treated for injuries related to
carrying a book bag _ with about 5,500 Americans treated annually
for backpack-related injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Some orthopedic specialists dispute the seriousness of the
backpack syndrome. ``I don't perceive this as much as a problem as
the public does,'' said Dr. E. William Schmitt, chief of pediatric
orthopedics at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston.
</P>
<P>
   But talk to kids, and they'll tell you it can be a real pain.
</P>
<P>
   Meredith Anderson, 13, weighs 120 pounds and was hauling a
29-pound bookbag around Inman. ``It really hurts in my shoulders
and back after I've been walking for a while,'' she said. ``It's no
fun.''

 &HT;    IOC to investigate Atlanta Games bid
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The International Olympic Committee said Monday it
will investigate improprieties by its members during Atlanta's bid
for the 1996 Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   However, the investigation, which will be conducted by the IOC's
new ethics commission, is not likely to exact any more changes in
what a U.S. congressman calls a ``culture of corruption'' within
the bidding process.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the most flagrant offenders of IOC edicts in Atlanta
already have been expelled or have resigned in the wake of the Salt
Lake City bribery scandal. And other rule benders have been accused
of less serious offenses than some IOC who were let off the hook
earlier by the ethics panel.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the ethics commission has no choice but to study the
report on the Atlanta bid submitted to the U.S. House Commerce
Committee by former Attorney General Griffin Bell. Rep. Fred Upton
(R-Mich.) said the report showed that ``votes were for sale.''
</P>
<P>
   The report detailed gifts and travel, and offers of college
scholarships, job assistance and other perks to IOC members and
their families by the Atlanta bid team.
</P>
<P>
   A copy of the report was sent last week to IOC President Juan
Antonio Samaranch after he asked the U.S. Olympic Committee to
provide details on any abuses related to the bid.
</P>
<P>
   Six IOC members were expelled and four resigned in connection
with the Salt Lake City vote-buying scandal. IOC members and their
relatives received $1.2 million worth of cash payments, college
scholarships and other favors from that city's bid team.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Atlanta's biggest beneficiaries, for example, Agustin
Arroyo of Ecuador and Jean-Claude Ganga of the Congo, already have
been ousted.
</P>
<P>
   Arroyo and his wife made at least three trips to Atlanta and
received $14,682 in travel and gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Ganga and various family members made three trips to the city,
with a side trip to New York, ringing up travel expenses of
$15,702. The bid committee also spent $35,216 for sports equipment
and tennis camps for Congolese athletes at Ganga's request.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC at the time only allowed one visit to bid cities.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the eight-man ethics panel, IOC Vice President
Keba Mbaye, a former vice president of the World Court at The
Hague, will examine the Atlanta report, according to IOC spokesman
Franklin Servan-Schreiber.
</P>
<P>
   If Mbaye finds ``anything meaningful,'' he will submit the
information to the full commission for review.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC received a letter from Upton asking Samaranch to testify
Oct. 14 during a House hearing on the Atlanta bid excesses. The
spokesman said he did not know if Samaranch would attend.
</P>
<P>
   The ethics commission is composed of three IOC members and five
from outside the IOC. The outside members include former U.S. Sen.
Howard Baker and former U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de
Cuellar.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has demonstrated leniency before, dropping the
cases of Australia's Phil Coles and South Korea's Kim Un-Yong.
</P>
<P>
   Coles had been cited for accepting travel perks from Salt Lake
City.
</P>
<P>
   And his ex-wife also claimed that representatives of Athens,
Greece's, unsuccessful bid for the 1996 Olympics gave the couple
jewelry worth $6,000.
</P>
<P>
   Coles could come under scrutiny again. Coles made two visits to
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   One was a trip with his then-wife and daughter, which included a
six-day stay at Disney World, for a total bill of $13,326.
</P>
<P>
   Kim, the highest-ranking official implicated in the Salt Lake
City affair, was cleared when the commission said it couldn't prove
he knew that the Salt Lake City committee paid for his son's salary
at a telecommunications company. His son, John Kim, and his
employer have been indicted for their roles in the scandal.

STOCKS REBOUND SLIGHTLY BUT CONDITIONS REMAIN UNSETTLED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices rebounded a bit Monday, as investors
became selective buyers of shares that were particularly hard-hit
by last week's steep sell-off. Still, major market averages closed
well under their session highs and some analysts said conditions
were still unsettled, suggesting that prices could fall a bit
further.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a little bounce that was not as convincing as I would
have liked,'' said Henry Herrmann, chief investment officer at
Waddell &AMP; Reed of Overland Park, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   By the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 24.06, or
0.2 percent, to 10,303.39. Earlier in the day the Dow was up more
than 100 points.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the blue-chip index recorded its worst one-week point
drop ever, falling 524.30, or 4.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Broader market averages did a bit better.
</P>
<P>
   Paced by gains in big technology stocks like Intel, Lucent
Technologies and America Online _ stocks that were hammered last
week _ the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index gained 5.95, or 0.5 percent,
to 1283.31.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the NASDAQ composite index rose 21.34, or 0.8
percent, to 2761.75. And the Russell 2000 index of small company
stocks gained 4.77, or 1.1 percent, to 421.86.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with recent Mondays, activity was a bit more brisk.
</P>
<P>
   Trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 780.8 million
shares. On the NASDAQ stock market, 932.6 million shares changed
hands.
</P>
<P>
   Signs from Japanese officials over the weekend that Tokyo will
take steps to bolster the value of the dollar against the yen
provided a brighter backdrop for the stock market Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus for the last two weeks has clearly been on the
dollar/yen relationship,'' said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst
at Jefferies &AMP; Co. ``We finally got a breather on that, and that is
probably why we ran up today.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from selected technology companies, gold stocks had a very
good day.
</P>
<P>
   The stocks rallied after European central banks said they will
limit bullion sales. Following the announcement, bullion prices
shot up 4 percent, the biggest gain for the metal in 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   Newmont Mining jumped 4 7/8, to 27 13/16. And Homestake Mining
rose 1 5/8, to 9 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, which was battered last week, was the most active stock
Monday. The leading computer-chip manufacturer rose 2 33/64, to 78
3/16. Meanwhile, Lucent rose 1 9/16, to 66 5/16. And America Online
gained 3 5/8, to 101 1/8.
</P>
<P>
   Proctor &AMP; Gamble was the Dow's biggest gainer. The consumer
products giant rose 2 1/16, to 99 3/8.
</P>
<P>
   Other Dow winners included General Electric, which was up 2, to
120, and Johnson &AMP; Johnson, which closed at 91 13/16, up 1 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a good day for interest-sensitive financial stocks.
American Express dropped 1 7/16, to 134 15/16. Citigroup lost 1, to
42 1/16. And BancAmerica fell 1 15/16, to 55 5/8.
</P>
<P>
   Concern that the Federal Reserve Board will vote to raise
short-term interest rates at a policy-making meeting next week has
dissipated, Hogan of Jefferies &AMP; Co. said. The concern has been
replaced by a widespread belief that a tightening will occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fed can't hurt us because the market has corrected for
another tightening,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we can start to focus on third-quarter earnings, which are
going to look terrific.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all technology stocks gained.
</P>
<P>
   IBM, a Dow component, fell 2, to 123.
</P>
<P>
   And Rambus Inc. slid 12 1/16 to 59 1/16, extending a loss of
more than 16 points that it suffered on Friday.

<P>
   PHOENIX _ His voice firm but his eyes glistening, former Vice
President Dan Quayle bid farewell Monday to a national political
career that has made him a household name _ and occasionally a
household laughingstock _ for more than a decade, announcing that
he would abandon his quest for the Republican presidential
nomination for lack of money and support.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a time to stay and there's a time to fold,'' Quayle
said quietly as his wife, Marilyn, stood beside him at a hotel news
conference in his adopted home state here. ``There's a time to know
when to leave the stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle endorsed none of his rivals, but pledged to work for the
Republicans' eventual nominee, which he said appears all but
certain to be Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   He took pains to note that at 52, he is hardly over the hill,
and referring with a twinkle to Richard Nixon's famously premature
farewell, said: ``I seriously doubt if this will be my last press
conference.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was an air of poignancy to the occasion, as Mrs.
Quayle seemed to struggle to hold back tears and misty-eyed aides
lined the wall of an elegant Frank Lloyd Wright ballroom at the
Arizona Biltmore Resort &AMP; Spa. It is always possible that Quayle,
who was a senator from Indiana, could run for lesser office
someday, but even longtime aides said his days as a national
candidate were effectively over, a casualty of his lingering _ if
in their eyes often unfair _ reputation as a lightweight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was sort of a sad moment today, though in some ways perhaps
an inevitable one,'' said William Kristol, Quayle's
vice-presidential chief of staff and now the editor of The Weekly
Standard. By chance Kristol watched his old boss' announcement from
the Bush campaign headquarters in Austin, Texas, where he had gone
to interview the Republican front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he underestimated how much damage had been done from
the vice-presidential years, and that he couldn't just sit out a
few years and then come back,'' Kristol said. ``I think if he were
on a successful second term as a governor, things would look
different.''
</P>
<P>
   In his news conference, and in a telephone interview afterward,
Quayle expressed no bitterness over the image problems that dogged
him from the moment of his debut as George Bush's running mate in
1988, from questions about his national guard service during the
Vietnam war, to doubts about his spelling ability when he put an
extra ``e'' on potato with a group of New Jersey school children.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he sounded only optimistic notes of gratitude for the
help of his family and friends, blended with frustration at his
inability to raise enough money to compete in the string of
front-loaded primaries next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, there's about 15 different ways you could conclude
a campaign,'' Quayle said in the interview. ``This would've been
No. 16.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle said that his New Hampshire campaign chairman, former
Gov. John H. Sununu, who was chief of staff in the Bush White
House, had convinced him that he had a reasonable shot at winning
the primary there, and his own polls showed him gaining, aides
said. But even if he won New Hampshire, Quayle said, he concluded
he could not afford to compete with Bush in the 18 contests that
will occur within 30 days afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reality set in,'' Quayle said, and in discussions over the
weekend, he decided winning the nomination would be ``virtually
impossible.'' For months, he had said he would not go through the
exercise of running if he did not think he could win, and so made
his announcement Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In the first six months of this year, Quayle raised about $3.5
million, to about $37 million for Bush, but aides said that was not
the former vice president's only problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money's a part of it but it's not all of it,'' said Quayle's
poll-taker, Kellyanne Fitzpatrick, who noted how sped-up the
current election cycle seems. ``At this point in the fall of 1991,
George Stephanopoulos was just making his first acquaintance with
Bill and Hillary Clinton,'' she said, adding that so much has
changed since then in how the nation judges and selects its
presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always say to be nominated as a Republican, you need cash,
conservatism, character and chits,'' Ms. Fitzpatrick said, ``but
you also need chatter, and this year the emphasis on buzz-building
has surpassed so many of these other nuts and bolts.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Quayle, who had sought to define himself in
large measure by his support for traditional family values, was at
pains to compete against other candidates, like Steve Forbes and
Pat Buchanan, for the support of the party's more conservative
voters. And indeed he said Monday that the way to win elections was
to offer a clear contrast to the Democrats, not try to soften
Republican positions to mimic them.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Like former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who with Rep.
John R. Kasich of Ohio and Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire preceded
him in dropping out of the Republican race, Quayle said he would
favor increasing the $1,000 individual limit on presidential
campaign contributions, to make it easier to raise money. But he
said he remained opposed to any proposals for more
taxpayer-financed matching funds for campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fitzpatrick and other aides said Quayle had also been
handicapped by having to run against Bush, whose father plucked
Quayle from comparative obscurity in the Senate to run for vice
president. She said Quayle was ``too much of a gentleman to take a
chain-saw to the front-runner.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Quayle also reflected on the challenges of
facing the son of his old patron.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never imagined in my wildest dreams that I would be running
against George Bush's son,'' Quayle said. ``Things would have been
a lot different had that not happened. A lot. It was very awkward.
I was very loyal to President Bush and the whole family.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, George W. Bush said of his rival, ``I wish him all the
best.''
</P>
<P>
   Since leaving the White House, Quayle has written books,
appeared on the lecture circuit and served on corporate and
charitable boards. He said Monday that he and his wife planned to
take some time off ``to decompress,'' but that it was too early to
talk about what he might do next, except that he would ``continue
to fight for those ideas that I believe in, fight for the
philosophy of smaller government, lowering taxes, strengthening the
American family and reinvesting in our national defense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the ideas of the Republican Party as well,'' he
added. ``I'm going to work to unite this party.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Like Bush, Quayle said he hoped that Buchanan would not bolt to
the Reform Party, saying, ``I don't think we ought to write anyone
out of the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Kristol said he thought time had already vindicated some of the
views for which Quayle was once roundly mocked, like his broadside
against the plot-line celebrating single motherhood in the TV
sitcom ``Murphy Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was willing to take abuse for saying something that
everyone now acknowledges was pretty important,'' Kristol said.
``In that respect, he will have a kind of intellectual and moral
vindication.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Kristol added, ``One of the odd things about politics is
when you get out, you get treated more fairly.''

CHINA'S NEW LEADERS EXEMPLIFY THE NATION'S CHANGES

 By ERIK ECKHOLM and ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Officially, power in China is concentrated in the
hands of a small number of men, all career communist politicians
who were alive when the People's Republic was declared on Oct. 1,
1949.
</P>
<P>
   But today a new class of leaders is emerging that will form
China's public face in the decades to come. They are men and women
in their 30s and 40s whose aims and experiences exemplify the
growing diversity of China after two decades of market-oriented
change.
</P>
<P>
   While ultimate power remains tightly linked to party politics,
many in the new generation exert influence in a wide variety of
other fields such as business, art or science.
</P>
<P>
   And in many ways they tend to be different from the ruling
generation, more flexible and cosmopolitan in their ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They automatically accept reform, they know it must happen,''
Li Qiang, a sociology professor at People's University in Beijing,
said of the generation coming into influence. ``They have often
been abroad and welcome the cultures of other countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Born toward the end of the tumultuous Maoist era, many younger
adults did not internalize the fear and caution that were essential
to survival then.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most older Chinese have the habit of listening to the radio in
the morning, because they did so every day in the 1960s to learn
what Mao wanted them to do,'' Li said. ``The younger generation is
more independent; it doesn't look for instructions.''
</P>
<P>
   Some emerging leaders, to be sure, join the Communist Party and
pursue careers in the government. In a country where the party
still has the final say in every field, most people who are out to
make a mark are careful to cultivate ties with the government.
</P>
<P>
   The six individuals profiled below represent an arbitrary
selection, in Beijing, from the multitudes of rising young stars.
Together, they provide a taste of the China being born.
</P>
<P>
   DONG YUNHU
</P>
<P>
   With his striped Pierre Cardin shirt and his easy smile, Dong
Yunhu doesn't fit the stereotype of a tow-the-line Communist. Yet
at just 37, he is a prime architect of China's sensitive human
rights policy.
</P>
<P>
   The phrase ``Chinese human rights policy'' might seem an
oxymoron to many in the West, where China is perhaps better known
for silencing political opponents with prison.
</P>
<P>
   But as founder and director since 1993 of the China Society for
Human Rights Studies, Dong organizes human rights exchanges with
other countries, publishes articles on the topic and advises the
government on how to mold and present its ideas.
</P>
<P>
   With a Ph.D in Western philosophy from a Chinese university, he
cites Kant, Hegel and the U.S. Bill of Rights in his quest to
develop ``a concept of human rights appropriate for China's
reality,'' which he freely acknowledges has non-Western priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West stressed personal and individual rights; we stress
the need for harmony between the individual and the collective,''
he said, from his office in the Tibet Hotel. ``The West stresses
political liberties, and we stress the right to subsistence.
</P>
<P>
   The child of a poor peasant family with 14 children, he defends
China's insistence that freedom from hunger is the most important
human right. But he adds, ``I don't think we'll ever be totally at
one with the West on these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a decade ago, Dong was something of a intra-party rebel,
daring to write about human rights at a time when the very topic
was considered a bourgeois obsession. By laboriously collecting
speeches and writings from the likes of Marx and Mao, he attempted
to convince party leaders that ``socialism and human rights were
not incompatible.''
</P>
<P>
   At first many balked, even blocking publication of his first
book. But ultimately his view prevailed, which he views as a great
personal triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very big change for the '90s _ opening up human
rights as a legitimate topic of study and concern,'' he said. ``Now
we can talk about it with foreign governments.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he notes that once China entered the world stage, it
needed to confront pressure from the West. ``Some of the criticism
seemed justified, but it seemed wrong to paint China as black as
they did,'' he said. ``China needed to speak out to develop its
arguments.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he admits that China still has problems, he maintains
that it now supports many of the same rights as the West, even
signing last year, though not ratifying, the International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights. To prove his point he, perhaps
surprisingly, uses free speech as an example. He points out that
the streets of Beijing are filled with people grumbling about the
Communist Party to each other, a great change from the past.
</P>
<P>
   The difference, he said, is how and where countries limit such
freedoms in the interest of national development.
</P>
<P>
   But even skeptical Westerners may find much to support in Dong's
human rights agenda. He relentlessly harps on the need for rule of
law and for officials to follow legal procedures. He has urged
better protection for women against discrimination and more
openness in government, including trials accessible to the public
and press.
</P>
<P>
   It is because of people like Dong that officials such as U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and U.N. Human Rights
Commissioner Mary Robinson say they can now have a human rights
dialogue with the Chinese government _ even though there is little
evidence yet that the two sides always speak the same language.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   LIU JUNNING
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Liu Junning does political theory, not politics,
which is why this 38-year-old scholar is able to do much of
anything at all. As one of China's most influential liberal
intellectuals _ that's liberal as in ``Western liberal democracy''
_ he operates on the boundaries of the permissible here,
disseminating ideas that he thinks are vital to the country's
progress.
</P>
<P>
   Liu has no illusions about the prospects for change. But when
the moment comes, he wonders, will anyone be ready? With their
constant talk of ``political reform'' and ``rule of law,'' Chinese
officials and scholars _ let alone common people _ often just show
how little they understand the concepts. Hence Liu's mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese need to know how `liberal democracy' differs from
`people's democracy,''' Liu said, ``They need to know how the rule
of law differs from using the law to rule, and how federalism
works. They need to know what constitutionalism is, and why it's
more than just having a written constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where I see myself,'' he said. ``People have different
jobs, and I think it's my job to answer these questions.'' He
pauses, a smile revealing that he knows how pertinent this sounds,
especially from such a polite and quiet man.
</P>
<P>
   Liu spends most of his time reading and writing, emerging from
his home for the occasional bookstore salon or speech on, say, the
relationship between private property rights and limited
government.
</P>
<P>
   He writes serious essays, often for the journal he started in
1995, Res Publica, which has given liberals a crucial forum and
students an alternative to their sterile textbooks. In keeping with
his mission, he also writes shorter articles for newspapers and
magazines. He has not been silenced, because he does not get
involved in political organizing or direct criticism of leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Many of his essays were collected in a recent book called
``Republic, Democracy, Constitutionalism: Studies of Liberal
Thought.'' He said he was influenced by Adam Smith, de Tocqueville
and the federalists; in print he can sound like Milton Friedman.
``Property rights are the core of human rights, economic activity
and legal activity, because they are the material precondition for
the exercise of other rights,'' one essay declaims.
</P>
<P>
   Climbing China's educational merit system, Liu emerged from a
small town in Anhui province to reach the top scholarly ranks in
Beijing. He has a doctorate in political theory from Beijing
University and a research position at the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, as Liu became a figure in the heady
intellectual scene in Beijing, an open-minded editor of the
official New China News Agency took him to Hong Kong for a stint in
journalism. Perhaps luckily he was there, away from trouble, during
the 1989 demonstrations and crackdown in Tiananmen Square. His boss
left for the United States, but Liu decided to return to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not optimistic, but there is still room to do something
useful,'' Liu said of the coming year. ``These kinds of ideas are
in great demand in China. The demand is great, the supply is
scarce.''
</P>
<P>
   ZHAO SHUJING
</P>
<P>
   Zhao Shujing became a feminist only in 1994, after she read
``The Second Sex'' by Simone de Beauvoir, then recently translated
into Chinese. Today, she is the executive producer of China's most
influential women's show, ``Half the Sky,'' which broadcasts three
times a week on state television.
</P>
<P>
   Outspoken and independent, Ms. Zhao represents a new breed of
Chinese women who pursue careers at an age when, earlier in this
century, they might already be approaching grandmotherhood. And she
said she belongs to a new brand of Chinese woman's movement _ one
initiated by women themselves rather than being prescribed by the
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last decade, women's consciousness has been stronger
than at any time in the last 100 years,'' she said recently at a
Beijing teahouse, wearing a trendy black pants outfit and lugging a
distressed leather bag.
</P>
<P>
   Her show's name is a nod to Mao's line ``Women hold up half the
sky'' _ his statement of female empowerment. But in fact, Ms. Zhao
said, reality did not always live up to that ideal in the early
years of communist rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, the women's movement was developed by men _ it
was not their own, it was Mao's,'' she said. The few women in power
were mostly wives of important officials and had little independent
claim to high status.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Zhao's generation that has largely changed, as women's
advocates _ often still with some connection to the government,
through jobs at state-run news media and universities _ are
increasingly vocal and speak their minds.
</P>
<P>
   These women, like Ms. Zhao, are taking on both society and
officialdom on topics like discrimination in housing and jobs. They
are encouraging open debate on issues not normally mentioned in
China, like the changing relationship between conservative mothers
and their more liberal daughters regarding dating and sex.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zhao said she never thought about feminist concerns as a
girl in Beijing, having absorbed her society's biases. ``I thought
the difference was just biological and that being a woman was a lot
of trouble,'' she said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   She said the publicity leading up to the 1995 International
Conference on Women, which was held in Beijing, impelled her and
many others to rethink their ideas. It was then that she switched
from general programming to the women's show.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in the early 1990s her television station _ like
most state institutions _ would not allocate apartments to single
women, who were forced to live in dormitories. Shortly after the
women's conference, senior women at the station protested to
government officials and, at age 35, she got an apartment for
herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, I think things are getting better,'' she said.
``But there is still lots to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   On her show she has run segments on the discrimination facing
women when they enter the job market from college, on domestic
abuse and on the educational problems of rural girls. She said
Chinese women over 40 carry a particular burden, since they often
have little schooling and are dismissed by society as being over
the hill.
</P>
<P>
   Still, at 37, she feels confidently unbound by such notions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't fear the threshold,'' she said. ``Women of my
generation, especially educated women, care much more about
capabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   She is traveling a new route, increasingly common among
professional women today: She is now married, but plans not to have
children. ``Many people in my circle don't want children _ it's too
much trouble,'' she said. ``The world has 6 billion people and so
many orphans. Is it necessary for me to give birth to be a woman?''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ZENG QIANG
</P>
<P>
   In China, too, hackers and MBAs dream of silicon jackpots. Among
the many start-ups trying to emulate everything from Yahoo to eBay,
3-year-old Sparkice I-Com Ltd. is already the old guard, and its
36-year-old founder Zeng Qiang _ Edward Zeng to foreigners _ is
already famous. All this before his company has made a dime or
seriously begun carrying out its plan for global e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   It is all on the verge, said Zeng, who conjures up wild success
with his spiel. ``We want to be the cyber-bridge between East and
West,'' he said, pointing to the large map of the world behind his
desk, next to the picture of President Clinton shaking his hand
last year at one of the Internet cafes that Zeng started here in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Others may dream of selling the proverbial shirt to a billion
Chinese, but Zeng's idea is instead to use the Internet to sell the
products of a million Chinese companies to wholesalers, retailers,
factories and individuals abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the future, connecting the merchandise made in China
with the global buyer,'' he said. ``We aim to be the dominant
mega-portal,'' he said, ``and I don't think anyone can compete with
us.'' Hedging his bets, though, he and several competitors are also
exploring the potential for domestic e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Zeng's history may entitle him to some confidence. Born in
Beijing, he studied economics at Qinghua University there and in
1987, after securing a master's degree, he became a policy adviser
in the central government's State Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
   He declines to discuss the tumultuous events of 1989, when
Beijing was engulfed in pro-democracy demonstrations, only
commenting that things look different in hindsight. But the facts
are suggestive: On June 4, when the tanks rolled in, he was
attending an econometrics conference in Tokyo. Instead of returning
home, he flew to Toronto with scarcely a dollar in his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as he could save $20, he bought a book called ``How to
Succeed in the Stock Market,'' he recalls fondly. He soon was in
another master's degree program; then he took a job as a
statistician for the Canadian government and started building his
own capital.
</P>
<P>
   The big flash came in early 1996, he said, when he read about an
Israeli company developing an Internet telephone service. He flew
to Israel to see for himself, and then hurried to Beijing,
establishing his chain of Internet cafes that are popular with
computerless students.
</P>
<P>
   No big business in China is entirely private, and Zeng is
building a series of strategic alliances at home, which are
necessary to obtain suppliers and gain official cooperation. He
already has a partnership with a state telecommunications company
and is exploring joint ventures with government ministries and
companies. He is also pursuing ties with some giant electronic
stores in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   So far the company has relied on capital _ ``something over $10
million,'' Zeng said _ from his own pocket and a handful of foreign
investors. Like other entrepreneurs here, he hopes to raise big
money abroad, perhaps with a public offering in New York. But all
investments are in limbo now, after a key minister's surprise claim
that foreign investment in Chinese Internet services is illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Projected revenues? ``We're targeting billions of dollars a
year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This year, between the cafes and modest Web sales, Sparkice
should take in $5 million, he said, but it projects five times more
for next year, and then ....
</P>
<P>
   SUN JIANJUN
</P>
<P>
   His style is more Hollywood than Beijing at the reception
announcing his latest baby, an ``entertainment gala'' featuring
Chinese and Russian classical performers in the Kremlin, destined
for broadcast on Chinese television.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Jianjun, the 43-year-old impresario who pulled off a similar
event in the Hollywood Bowl two years ago, darts among the
celebrities and executives, making sure that the right
introductions are made, whispering urgent messages into the right
ears.
</P>
<P>
   It is a prestigious project, but Sun's bread and butter right
now is the weekly television show he produces, Global
Entertainment, which features clips from new movies abroad
(endlessly fascinating to Chinese who buy the latest American hits
on pirated videodiscs) and interviews with Chinese directors and
actors. It has high ratings on the leading Beijing network, and its
sponsors include Hewlett-Packard, Panasonic, Coca-Cola and Pepsi.
</P>
<P>
   With longish hair, immaculate clothes and a knack for intricate
deals, Sun is emblematic of a new generation of producers and
directors who operate on the competitive fringes of the stodgy
government studios, trying to entertain and make money rather than
preach.
</P>
<P>
   His company, Pegasus Film &AMP; TV Production Center, produced a
modestly successful imitation of the American series ``Three's
Company'' two years ago and is developing a more ambitious family
comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government control is not the main problem for the
entertainment business,'' he said in his spacious, rose-colored
office inside the government's aging Beijing Film Studio compound.
``The main problem is quality,'' he said. ``Writers, especially,
just don't know how to entertain people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many people in China _ not just the government, but
producers and directors too _ still think that the main purpose of
television is to educate people,'' he said. ``They want to tell
people how to live their lives, which is kind of stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   He seems to be friends with everyone, from the conductor of the
Beijing Symphony to hot film directors like Fang Xiaogang, a
neighbor at the hip, expensive Asian Games Village apartments. Sun
has cultivated what the Chinese call good guanxi, or
``connections,'' not just in the arts but also in the powerful
ministries and networks that still call the shots.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from art college in the southern city of
Nanjing in the late 1970s, Sun found his way to the University of
California at Irvine, where he studied fine arts. He stayed in
California working as a photographer.

   By 1990, Sun and three partners from China and Taiwan sensed
that opportunities were opening in the entertainment business. They
incorporated Pegasus in the United States and created a joint
venture with Beijing Film Studio, in hopes of co-producing movies.
</P>
<P>
   That hope was dampened by the dismal state of the country's film
industry, so he dived into television and special events. But now,
after six years of experience and contacts, Sun feels ready to make
his move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the people, and I know the industry,'' he said of
filmdom. ``I just need the right time.''

 BEIJING: right time.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LU ZHI
</P>
<P>
   Lu Zhi, a leading light in China's nascent conservation
movement, was only 16 in 1981 when she was accepted by elite
Beijing University from her home in the northwestern city of
Lanzhou.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen years later, she has more than fulfilled her early
promise, distinguishing herself as a scientist and an awesomely
hardy field researcher who may know more than anyone about China's
most famous species, the giant panda.
</P>
<P>
   And now, looking younger than her years, she has thrown herself
into the most complicated challenge yet: saving the mountain
redoubts of the thousand or so surviving pandas, regions that
happen to be densely populated by poor farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a government group named her one of China's ``Top 10
Young Intellectuals,'' an unusual honor for a Chinese employed by
one of the few foreign-based nongovernmental organizations allowed
here, the World Wide Fund for Nature.
</P>
<P>
   As a college senior and an unhappy biochemistry major, Ms. Lu
said, she went on a field trip with Pan Wenshi, the doyen of
Chinese panda researchers, and found her calling. So for her
doctorate, she switched to zoology.
</P>
<P>
   It was a personal breakthrough. ``Up to then, I always did what
people told me to do,'' she said in her Beijing office the other
day, just before taking off for rugged western Sichuan province.
</P>
<P>
   When she started her research, little was known about pandas'
living habits, and she would spend most of seven years tracking
them in the wild, often without adequate food or warmth for
herself. Today, she plays down those hardships and notes how lucky
she was to find pandas quickly and then come to know them ``like
members of a family.''
</P>
<P>
   In path-breaking publications, Ms. Lu and her mentor, Pan,
refuted the impression, derived from pandas in zoos, that the
species has trouble breeding. Left alone in their bamboo havens, it
turned out, they do fine; the problem is protecting the land.
</P>
<P>
   Another big question was whether pandas are dangerously inbred.
So Ms. Lu took a fellowship at the National Institutes of Health in
Maryland, where she mastered genetic analysis and found that
inbreeding is not yet serious. Passing up offers abroad, she
returned home to make another leap, from science to sociology. She
now spends her time with local farmers trying to harmonize economic
development with wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   No panda pictures grace her office walls. ``Sometimes I get
tired of them,'' she said. The panda is the global logo of her
organization and a lucrative tool for fund raising, all of which
leaves her cold. ``To me, the panda picture becomes a symbol of
conservation politics,'' she said. ``And a panda in the office is
different from a panda in the wild.''
</P>
<P>
   She has turned down offers of government jobs, but is well aware
of the government's power. She expects to return to Beijing
University, where, she said, she could be in a better position to
help shape national policies, train a new generation of
conservation scientists and perhaps even find time to reacquaint
herself with some pandas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see them any more,'' she lamented. ``I see people
now.''

CHINA TAKES SECURITY PRECAUTIONS BEFORE CELEBRATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ As they complete preparations for extravagant
festivities on Friday marking 50 years of communist rule, the
Chinese authorities are leaving nothing to chance. This week, as
rehearsals involving hundreds of thousands of marchers, rumbling
convoys of tanks and screaming squadrons of fighter jets taper
down, the focus has shifted to security.
</P>
<P>
   In one sign of the meticulous planning, Zhao Ziyang, the former
Communist Party chief and prime minister, has been moved from his
home in central Beijing to a distant suburb and his visitors are
more tightly restricted than usual, his friends say. Zhao has been
under house arrest since 1989, when he was deposed for sympathizing
with pro-democracy student demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   Zhao's successors apparently hope to prevent him from dampening
the big party by sneaking out a call for political change, as he
sometimes has in the past.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the superlatives surrounding the celebration,
last Friday 660,000 pensioners _ most of whom have already served
on local government committees _ were deputized as ``activists'' to
vigilantly patrol their neighborhoods, local newspapers reported.
</P>
<P>
   Each was given a new red armband, and they are visible on back
streets, sitting or strolling as they keep a lookout for potential
bombers, illegal migrants, die-hard practitioners of the banned
Falun Gong mystical exercises, and other threats to public safety.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities are determined to prevent any demonstrations by
spiritual groups or pro-democracy dissidents, let alone bombings by
ethnic separatists or other angry citizens. In an exhortation to
the police last week, Public Security Minister Jia Chunwang said:
``This day of joy for the country's people is one that hostile
elements at home and abroad find painful.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of migrant workers from other regions of China have
been sent packing, and anyone who is not a legally registered
resident of Beijing has generally been warned to stay away. For the
last few weeks, the police have screened arriving passengers at
train and bus stations, sending home some who lacked Beijing work
permits and could not show a legitimate purpose for visiting. Every
hotel and hostel has had to report the identities of all guests to
the police.
</P>
<P>
   Even Beijing residents, apart from the 500,000 taking part, will
have little chance to actually see the parade. Nearby streets will
be barricaded and the public will have to watch the festivities on
television, with any disappointment perhaps assuaged by the special
seven-day holiday decreed last week. There will also be fireworks
displays in 10 parks around the city.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Residents of some apartments along the parade route received
written instructions to remain inside their homes, with windows
closed, from 2 p.m. Thursday until 8 a.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Beijingers have enjoyed some tangible benefits. The
reported 10 million pots of flowers now gracing city streets will
wilt, but newly widened streets and sidewalks are here to stay.
</P>
<P>
   A newly opened pedestrian mall along several blocks of
Wangfujing Street, not far from Tiananmen Square, was an instant
hit. Last weekend, hundreds of thousands of people strolled the
area, snapping pictures of one another and watching a water
fountain dance to the sounds of a Strauss waltz.

 &HT;    GUC workers start recovery process
 &HT;    By Dawn Bryant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ Greenville Utilities has traded in the soggy
sandbags for cleanup gear.
</P>
<P>
   With the city's electric and water services stabilized after
last week's record flooding, GUC has shifted its attention to
salvaging what it can from its soaked Operations Center off Mumford
Road.
</P>
<P>
   Workers had to evacuate the building _ which houses the
emergency center during storms _ Sept. 17 after record-high Tar
River levels started seeping in the doors and windows.
</P>
<P>
   Employees raised all computers to the desktops thinking that
would keep them safe. It didn't. Papers, maps, pictures and
vehicles were left behind, and are likely ruined.
</P>
<P>
   It could take months before the cleanup is finished and normal
activity resumes there.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 275 employees have been relocated to GUC's main
office. Officials are searching for rentable space.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now they are just trying to find somewhere,'' said Sue
Bizzaro, GUC's public information officer. ``People are doubled up
at this site (downtown).''
</P>
<P>
   More than a week after the hasty evacuation, two 30-ton off-road
dump trucks shuttled workers through the receding waters to the
center to pick up what was left.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like a bomb went off. I try to warn everybody. If you
can live without it, don't go get it,'' said Gilbert Smithwick of
Sawyer's Land Developing, which is shuttling workers. ``Go buy
another one. It's not worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   One worker took a large plastic container with him to gather
belongings. He came back in tears with everything salvageable in
his pockets.
</P>
<P>
   The 4- to 8-foot floodwaters wiped out files, maps, furniture
and every vehicle parked in the GUC lot, including some workers'
personal cars. Damage estimates for heavy equipment only totals
nearly $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came so fast, and we were so busy responding to emergency
needs, they had no time to rescue the commission vehicles or their
own,'' said Ed Askew, GUC's director of support services. ``When we
went in there (last week), the only thing we could see was the
antennae sticking up above the water.''
</P>
<P>
   A disaster recovery firm from Memphis, Tenn., hired by GUC for
$120,000, arrived Monday to salvage irreplaceable files. GUC crews
hope to retrieve information from computer hard drives.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also have ordered more vehicles after nearly half the
fleet _ 75 to 90 trucks and vans _ fell victim to the floodwaters.
</P>
<P>
   During an emergency meeting Thursday, the GUC board approved
spending $764,017 for vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Costs for cleanup and damage likely won't cause any rate hikes,
said Malcolm Green, GUC's general manager/CEO.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't envision that being the case,'' he said. ``A lot of
what we are doing is going to be covered by insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   What insurance doesn't cover, the Federal Emergency Management
Agency should, Green said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, workers _ donning waders, green rubber gloves and
face masks _tried to rescue what they could from the center, the
garage and the warehouse. The engineering part of the building
opened just a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nasty,'' said Rodney Sutton, a GUC load management
technician for five years. ``Our office is destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton was one of several workers loading cardboard boxes with
whatever wasn't ruined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that the water didn't get to, and that ain't much,''
Sutton said.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the center, warped desks sit lopsided in the offices;
bookshelves have collapsed, spewing the contents, and clumps of
waterlogged papers are strewn across the gray carpet, which sloshes
as workers step on it.
</P>
<P>
   A 4-foot water mark taints the light-colored walls, and
everything is coated in a brown film. A strong stench makes the
cleanup task more challenging.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to gather up what we can,'' said Howard Corey,
GUC's water resources engineering coordinator. ``There are 22 years
worth of work here I've been working on in my career. It is hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Signs of employees' hurried exit held up through the flood. In
Corey's office, a can of Pepsi and a snack still sit on a table. In
another office, a ruler sits on a soggy map spread across the desk.
</P>
<P>
   Officials don't have a damage estimate, in part because so many
items and cars are still submerged.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are still discovering things that are missing,'' Askew
said.
</P>
<P>
   The cleanup has been more challenging because so many telephone
numbers, insurance records and equipment descriptions were kept at
the center. Askew's office also was in the operations center.
</P>
<P>
   Now working from the MIS director's vacant office downtown, he
has tried to organize what few papers he has. On Friday he
frantically searched for the little things he needed to do that _
file folders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating,'' Askew said. ``You have nothing. You don't
have phone numbers. There's so much work to do and you have
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   GUC's downtown office is expected to remain closed through the
week. GUC Express, 509 S.E. Greenville Boulevard, is open from 7:30
a.m. to 5:30 p.m. weekdays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll clean up everything we've got. We'll have to,'' Corey
said.

RESEARCHERS TESTING ENDOSTATIN BEGIN ENLISTING VOLUNTEERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Volunteers can begin signing up Tuesday for the
long-awaited first human trials of endostatin, the tumor-starving
cancer drug from the laboratory of Dr. Judah Folkman.
</P>
<P>
   Endostatin, an angiogenesis inhibitor, has demonstrated in mice
a striking ability to shrink tumors by cutting off the blood supply
they must have to grow and spread. But until now it has not been
given to humans.
</P>
<P>
   Only 15 to 30 patients will receive the drug during the first
phase of testing, whose purpose is strictly to determine if
endostatin has harmful side effects and to establish what doses can
be safely tolerated. It is called a Phase I trial, and there will
shortly be two more of them opening at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center
in Houston and at the University of Wisconsin in Madison.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston trial is being sponsored by EntreMed, a Maryland
biotech company that has licensed the rights to develop the drug
from Children's Hospital, where Folkman and his colleagues have
been studying angiogenesis _ the formation of new blood vessels _
and ways to block it for decades.
</P>
<P>
   The development of endostatin as a drug has been surrounded by
enormous publicity, stock market speculation, and some controversy
because of the difficulty some other researchers have had in
duplicating Folkman's results. Officials involved with the clinical
trial are braced for an avalanche of volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the high visibility of Endostatin and the small size of
this study, we have done everything possible to make our procedures
open, impartial and objective,'' said Dr. Donald Kufe, a physician
at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute who is the principal investigator
of the study.
</P>
<P>
   Written with a capital ``E,'' Endostatin is the trade name of
the drug being made synthetically by EntreMed. The name endostatin
refers to the substance that is made naturally as part of the
body's blood-clotting system.
</P>
<P>
   As volunteers call or access the Web sites, their names will be
put into a computer database, from which names will be chosen at
random for further screening. Those who are picked will be invited
to one of the participating hospitals to determine if they are
clinically eligible for the study.
</P>
<P>
   Those who pass the screening will be selected, in the order in
which they were determined eligible, to receive the drug.
</P>
<P>
   The names of those who passed the screening but were not chosen
for the trial will go back into the database, together with those
who apply later.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer patients wanting to participate in the Boston trial can
call a telephone hotline, visit any of three Web sites, or call a
service that will send information by fax.
</P>
<P>
   Participating medical centers are Dana-Farber/Partners Cancer
Care (which includes Brigham and Women's and Massachusetts General
hospitals) and the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone hotline number is (617) 632-5100. It will be
answered between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. Eastern Standard Time by nurses
who specialize in cancer care.
</P>
<P>
   The Web sites' addresses are
http://www.dana-farber.net/endostatin at Dana-Farber;
http://www.cancer.mgh.harvard.edu at Mass General; and
http://www.bidmc.caregroup.org/endostatin/default.asp.
</P>
<P>
   To be eligible, volunteers must satisfy a number of criteria.
They must be 18 or older and have a solid malignant tumor that is
not reponsive to any form of therapy. The trial excludes patients
with leukemia, lymphoma or myeloma or a primary brain tumor or
involvement of the central nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers must be expected to live at least six months and are
required to be mobile and able to carry out normal life activities.
</P>
<P>
   Other criteria are available in the information that is on the
Web site or can be obtained on the hotline.
</P>
<P>
   The study is expected to run for nine months to a year, with
small groups of patients (3 to 6) taking the drug in succession.
The first group of patients will receive daily intravenous
infusions of endostatin for 28 days, then will simply be observed
for 14 days. The next group, then, will be given a higher dose for
28 days while the first group continues on its initial dose, and so
on.
</P>
<P>
   If the drug proves tolerable in the Phase I trials, it will then
enter Phase II and Phase III testing which includes greater numbers
of patients and is designed to look for beneficial effects.
</P>
<P>
   Other, less potent angiogenesis inhibitors are in early testing
in human patients, and reports suggest the drugs are well-tolerated
by patients and appear to combat tumors, though there remains too
little evidence to say how valuable they might be.

NO. 1 DESTINATION IN 2020? TRY CHINA, THEN FRANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Oct. 3)  
(lb) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It may not be too soon to start brushing up on Chinese. Why?
Because by 2020, China is expected to become the world's top
tourist destination with 130 million annual visitors, and 100
million Chinese are expected to visit other lands.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, China had a relatively modest 24 million visitors
last year, good enough for sixth place, while the 8.4 million
Chinese visitors to other lands (``outbound tourists'') ranked
ninth. But its 100 million outbound tourists will account for
almost a quarter of the 405 million Asian travelers expected by
2020, a staggering increase from the region's 84.4 million outbound
travelers in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   These forecasts are from the World Tourism Organization, a
worldwide group of 138 countries and territories, based in Madrid,
Spain, that gathers tourism statistics and publishes reports.
</P>
<P>
   At the International Tourism Asia trade show in Hong Kong last
month, the organization also predicted that by 2020 France will
drop from first to second place in arrivals (even though its
visitors will increase to 106.1 million by 2020, up from 70 million
last year) and the United States will remain third (102.4 million
visitors, up from 47.1 million currently).

<P>
   Spain, with 47.7 million visitors last year, will have 73.9
million in 2020, but will still drop a notch to fourth place. Hong
Kong, currently 18th with almost 9.7 million visitors, will vault
to fifth place with 56.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining top 10 positions are expected to be occupied by
Britain (currently in fifth place), Italy (currently fourth),
Mexico (seventh), the Russian Federation (13th) and the Czech
Republic (12th).
</P>
<P>
   The tourist organization also predicted that the ubiquitous
Germans, who have long led in outbound travelers, including 82.9
million last year, will continue to lead the list with almost 153
million in 2020. Japanese travelers, who numbered 16.8 million in
1997, the latest figure available, will soar to 141 million, for
second place, while the 123.3 million outbound Americans in 2020
will be more than twice the 52.7 million who traveled in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Predictions, of course, are informed guesses at best, but World
Tourism Organization forecasts have often been on target or close
to it. Two years ago, for example, it forecast that China would be
the world's No. 1 destination by the year 2020, and it stuck to
that prediction despite the recent economic crisis in East Asia and
the Pacific, which draws many of its tourists from the region.
</P>
<P>
   At the Hong Kong meeting, the organization said that to prepare
for the expected influx, the Chinese government is investing a lot
of money in promoting tourism and relaxing laws governing the
tourist industry.
</P>
<P>
   The tourism organization also predicted almost a year ago that
tourism to East Asia and the Pacific would bounce back stronger
than ever after 2000, barring any new major incident. And at the
Hong Kong conference, Deborah Luhrman, a World Tourism spokeswoman,
told delegates that the economy of the region seems to be
stabilizing.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the economic battering, East Asia and the Pacific still
drew a respectable 87 million tourists last year, according to
Francesco Frangialli, the organization's secretary-general. Much of
the shortfall in Japanese tourists, he said, was offset by
Europeans and North Americans attracted by lower prices and good
package deals.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of a comeback are already apparent in several Asian
nations. Tourist arrivals to Hong Kong, for example, increased 11.1
percent for the first seven months of this year, compared with the
same months of 1998. Thailand posted an 11 percent increase through
June of this year over the first six months of 1998. And Singapore
tourism rose 9.5 percent through July, compared with the same seven
months of 1998, even though visitors from Japan fell almost 13
percent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it is important to remember that many predictions
about tourism are as fleeting as the life span of the mosquito. Two
years ago, for example, the World Tourism Organization predicted
that ``the tourists of the 21st century will be traveling further
afield on their holidays, with the percentage of long-haul travel
increasing from 18 percent in 1995 to 24 percent by 2020.''
</P>
<P>
   But 13 months later, in November 1998, the WTO's Business
Council (a group representing the private sector within the larger
organization) released a study saying that because the amount of
leisure time available for many people is likely to decline, the
trend to shorter, more frequent holidays closer to home will
accelerate _ a trend that has been pronounced in the United States
for almost a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that the periodic warnings _ the first more than a year
ago from the World Congress on Snow and World Tourism, the most
recent a report for the Worldwide Fund for Nature in Britain _ that
global warming could erode beaches, reduce snowfall over ski areas
and otherwise play havoc with tourist areas, and the future is
probably as uncertain as ever. But barring widespread economic,
political or climatic upheaval, one thing seems certain _ tourism
will continue growing at record rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our results for 1998 confirm that people do not stop traveling
altogether, even during tough times,'' Frangialli said. Instead,
they underscore that tourism ``has become a deeply rooted part of
our culture at the end of the 20th century.''

CALIFORNIA MAKES SWEEPING CHANGES IN REGULATION OF HMOS

 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Gov. Gray Davis signed on Monday a package of
bills that will make radical changes in the relationship between
patients and health maintenance organizations in the state and
could well influence managed health care coverage across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The broad set of bills, hammered out between advocates on both
sides over several months, will give patients in HMOs the right to
sue their health insurers for punitive damages and entitle patients
to an external review of decisions denying medical coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation will also require managed care providers to pay
for second opinions on some treatments, require coverage for the
testing and treatment of breast cancer, require coverage of
contraceptives and expand coverage for serious mental illnesses. It
will create a new state Department of Managed Care to regulate the
massive industry, which covers about 23 million people in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   The provision that gives patients the right to seek damages when
they have suffered substantial harm provides a way around a
25-year-old federal law that prohibits many such suits. It has been
championed by consumer advocates for years and was the most
contentious part of the package.
</P>
<P>
   A battle at least as contentious over the issue is also under
way in Congress as part of the debate on a Patient Bill of Rights.
Representatives of health care insurers have long criticized this
provision, saying that its potential costs would outweigh its
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   While there is no guarantee that the changes in California will
adopted by other states or be a decisive factor in the
congressional debate, California has long been a leader in the
development and regulation of managed care, and many of the
country's largest insurers are based here.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many other states look to California for guidance
on regulatory issues, and it was clear that Monday's signing was
being watched closely. Texas has, for two years, had a similar law
allowing patients to seek damages, and the experience there has
also pushed reform elsewhere, in part by demonstrating that the
avalanche of lawsuits some insurers warned against has not
materialized.
</P>
<P>
   But both consumer advocates and HMO industry leaders ultimately
found something to praise in the package of 21 bills, the product
of a series of compromises that have created what many
characterized as landmark legislation in the struggle on the
slippery financial and ethical terrain of managed care to make it
both profitable to the insurers and responsive to patient needs.
</P>
<P>
   At one time Davis, a centrist Democrat, was perceived by
consumer advocates as resistant to giving patients such broad
rights to seek punitive damages, but on Monday he hailed the bills
as a solid middle ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``None too infrequently, Californians fighting for their lives
are forced at the same time to fight HMOs,'' Davis said at the
signing, held at the Family Medical Center in North Hollywood.
``It's time to make the health of the patient the bottom line with
California HMOs''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I want to make sure managed care is more about
quality care than it is about managed cost, and that's what these
reforms will do.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter Zelman, president of the California Association of Health
Plans, a trade group that represents most of the HMOs in the state,
said: ``This is going to be a shot in the arm for those advocating
reform bills in Congress and in other states.'' He said that he
felt the cost of law suits would drive up premiums for consumers,
but that, overall, ``this was a good package of bills.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the industry particularly supported the bill providing
for external review of decisions by HMOs denying coverage to
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Court, the advocacy director of the Foundation for
Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, which sponsored the bill creating the
right to punitive damages, said that the threat of lawsuits would
help patients, even if they never have to go to court, by
pressuring the companies to put medical concerns first.
</P>
<P>
   ``The threat of lawsuits and of substantial damages forces HMOs
to give better care and it shifts the balance of power over medical
decisions to the people who really have the medical knowledge,''
Court said.
</P>
<P>
   One did not have to go far to hear some of these views from
patients. Ira Horn, 69, was at the signing at the medical center
and said the law would hurt people like himself who cannot afford
an H.M.O.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the measures signed into law on Monday were fought
successfully by Davis' predecessor, Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican.
But the political ground has shifted in recent years with more
patients and consumer groups criticizing the way financial
considerations were being used to limit access to medical care by
HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, despite the federal prohibition against certain
kinds of suits against HMOs, some suits have succeeded, putting
further pressure on legislatures to put regulations in place.
Earlier this year a jury in California gave a record punitive award
of $116 million to the widow of a former prosecutor who died
because of what were said to be delays in providing treatment for
his stomach cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Court explained that federal law prohibited suits in disputes
over benefits, but not if the basis of the challenge was the
quality of the care provided. That interpretation, he said, had
already been tested in Texas and the courts upheld the state law,
thus giving a green light to California and other states.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The right to sue for punitive damages has been the most prickly
provision in the Patient Bill of Rights that the Congress has been
working on. The Senate passed its version of the bill earlier, and
it has a measure providing for independent, external review of
decisions denying medical care, but does not permit suits for
damages. The measure appears to have a better chance of passing in
the House, which is expected to take up the measure next month.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Ignagni, the president of the American Association of
Health Plans, the national representative of the HMO industry,
called much of the California package a model, saying, ``This is
the first process we have seen where all sides have come together
to do the real work.''
</P>
<P>
   However, she criticized the provision on law suits, saying it
would prove expensive and unnecessary.

NEWS SOURCE IDENTIFIED BY EX-REPORTER SUES PAPER

<P>
   In a move with serious implications for the relationship between
reporters and sources, former Chiquita Brands lawyer George Ventura
filed suit Monday against The Cincinnati Enquirer and its owner,
Gannett. Ventura, who faced criminal charges for providing the
Enquirer with inside information on Chiquita, said the paper
violated an agreement to treat him as a confidential source, by
revealing his identity to law enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter-century after ``Deep Throat'' contributed to the
toppling of a president, the Cincinnati case was further evidence
that whistle-blowers, the lifeblood of investigative journalism,
seem to be an endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   In November Disney will create shock waves with the release of
``The Insider,'' a film detailing how a tobacco-industry
whistle-blower, Jeffrey Wigand, risked health and happiness trying
to get CBS executives to let him tell his story on ``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   A former CNN producer, April Oliver, who was dismissed for her
role in the ill-fated Operation Tailwind story, recently identified
retired Major General John Singlaub as her confidential source in a
countersuit she filed against him.
</P>
<P>
   And the judge in the libel suit by the former Olympic Park
bombing suspect, Richard Jewell, is threatening to jail two Atlanta
Journal-Constitution reporters unless they identify the sources who
discussed the Jewell investigation with them.
</P>
<P>
   The Ventura controversy is another ``example of where ethics and
law cross each other,'' said a University of Minnesota media
professor, Jane Kirtley. ``It's got more issues than a law
school.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit stems from the Enquirer's series, published in 1998,
on Chiquita's business operations. Shortly after it ran, the paper,
acknowledging that it had illegally obtained Chiquita voice-mail
messages, fired Mike Gallagher, the reporter who had broken into
the system; publicly apologized; and paid Chiquita at least $10
million in reparations.
</P>
<P>
   The purloined voice-mail messages spawned a criminal case.
During that investigation Gallagher struck a deal with the
prosecutor in which he agreed to disclose his sources. Ventura _
who is now unemployed _ ultimately pleaded no contest to charges
connected to providing access to the voice mails.
</P>
<P>
   In his breach-of-contract suit filed in US District Court in
Cincinnati, Ventura states that his cooperation ``was predicated
strictly upon the numerous, explicit and unconditional
representations of these reporters . . . that his identity as a
source of these documents and information would forever remain
anonymous and confidential.'' He claims that his ``identity as a
source'' was subsequently revealed, subjecting him to criminal
prosecution and ``great harm in his personal and professional
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher's attorney Patrick Hanley said Monday that ``as far as
Mike Gallagher is concerned, we've always maintained that there's
no breach of contract to Mr. Ventura on his behalf.'' Enquirer
president Harry Whipple issued a statement saying: ``The Enquirer
has never disclosed any information that would identify a source.
This case is without merit.'' Gannett had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a purely legal matter, (Ventura's) on good ground,''
declared Gregg Leslie, acting executive director of the Reporters
Committee for Freedom of the Press, referring to the Cohen vs.
Cowles Media precedent. In that case, public relations consultant
Dan Cohen successfully sued after he provided two Minnesota papers
with documents on a rival candidate on the condition of anonymity
and they later published his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``That certainly is a significant decision with respect to the
rights of sources,'' said Ventura's attorney Marc Mezibov.
</P>
<P>
   Mezibov says a victory for Ventura would be a boon to journalism
by reinforcing ``the integrity of relationships between sources and
newspapers. It will encourage sources to be more forthcoming.''
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts say the suit creates a dicey tradeoff between
the need to protect sources and the desire to keep the courts from
intervening in the reporting process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reporter-source agreement is not something that should be
enforced by a court of law,'' said Leslie, who is uncomfortable
with the courts ``playing editor.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Rosenstiel, director for the Project for Excellence in
Journalism, worries that the effort to ``make the negotiations with
(sources and) journalists a part of the contract law'' is part of a
growing trend for litigants ``to address press misdeeds through
legal means.''
</P>
<P>
   But even among those concerned about the court's role, there is
a recognition of the sanctity of the confidentiality agreement.
Leslie said that Ventura is ``certainly a very sympathetic case.''
</P>
<P>
   And Rosenstiel noted that that ``one fundamental public good is
that the press be able to keep watch on the powerful. To chill that
would have dire consequences. . . . If the press lies to sources,
what good are we?''

 &HT;    Huffy halts manufacture of bikes in U.S.
 &HT;    By Tim Tresslar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Even as Huffy Corp. cedes its longstanding battle
with low-cost Chinese imports, Mexico now stands to become the
United States' next major importer of low-cost bikes, industry
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Huffy announced Monday it will stop domestic bike production by
Dec. 31, closing plants in Farmington, Mo. and Southaven, Miss.,
and instead relying on Asian and Mexican imports.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes after years of Huffy slugging it out in an
increasingly competitive market that pitted the local
manufacturer's products against those made overseas by companies
with lower labor costs. Now high-end bicycle producers comprise
most of the domestic bike-making market.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 10 years, the Peoples Republic of China has become
a low-cost bike-making center for Taiwan manufacturers because
Chinese workers will labor for lower wages, said Michael
Gamstetter, editor of ``Bicycle Retailer and Industry News.''
Chinese plants turn out mostly low- and mid-priced bikes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to industry estimates, the U.S. ranks as Taiwan's
biggest customer, receiving 43.5 percent of Taiwan's bicycle
imports during the first 10 months of 1998. In total, Taiwan during
that period shipped an estimated eight million bikes worth $717.8
million, experts said. Japan, Holland, England, Germany, Belgium,
Sweden and France also rank as heavy consumers of Taiwanese
products.
</P>
<P>
   Frustration over low-cost imports in the mid-1990s prompted
domestic manufacturers such as Huffy and Roadmaster to accuse China
of dumping cheap bikes into the U.S. market, said Huffy Chief
Financial Officer Thomas Frederick. The Federal Trade Commission
found some evidence to support these claims, but the International
Trade Commission later overturned that decision and refused to
level any duties, he said.
</P>
<P>
   European bicycle makers have launched similar campaigns against
imports from Taiwan. The European Union recently enacted
``anti-dumping'' duties against Taiwanese manufacturers, a move
some saw as legalized protectionism.
</P>
<P>
   As U.S. bicycle companies increasingly rely on imports, Mexico
could become a hotbed for bicycle manufacturing by Taiwan
companies, Gamstetter said. Mexico is close enough to supply U.S.
companies with bicycles quickly. In addition, trading with Mexico
presents fewer language barriers and lower tariffs than trading
with Taiwan, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Huffy to import more bikes from Mexico because its competitor,
Brunswick Corp., already has done so, he said. Industry experts
have estimated Huffy and Brunswick have enough capacity in Mexico
to make four million bicycles. Brunswick has two plants in Mexico
and Huffy buys more than half of its bikes from plants in Mexico
and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Gamstetter said Huffy enters the international market with
greater buying power than its competitors because of the sheer
volume of the company's purchases. Buying from foreign
manufacturers also will give Huffy better bikes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a smart business move,'' he said.

NEWS SOURCE IDENTIFIED BY EX-REPORTER SUES PAPER
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   In a move with serious implications for the relationship between
reporters and sources, former Chiquita Brands lawyer George Ventura
filed suit Monday against The Cincinnati Enquirer and its owner,
Gannett. Ventura, who faced criminal charges for providing the
Enquirer with inside information on Chiquita, said the paper
violated an agreement to treat him as a confidential source, by
revealing his identity to law enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter-century after ``Deep Throat'' contributed to the
toppling of a president, the Cincinnati case was further evidence
that whistle-blowers, the lifeblood of investigative journalism,
seem to be an endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   In November Disney will create shock waves with the release of
``The Insider,'' a film detailing how a tobacco-industry
whistle-blower, Jeffrey Wigand, risked health and happiness trying
to get CBS executives to let him tell his story on ``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   A former CNN producer, April Oliver, who was dismissed for her
role in the ill-fated Operation Tailwind story, recently identified
retired Major General John Singlaub as her confidential source in a
countersuit she filed against him.
</P>
<P>
   And the judge in the libel suit by the former Olympic Park
bombing suspect, Richard Jewell, is threatening to jail two Atlanta
Journal-Constitution reporters unless they identify the sources who
discussed the Jewell investigation with them.
</P>
<P>
   The Ventura controversy is another ``example of where ethics and
law cross each other,'' said a University of Minnesota media
professor, Jane Kirtley. ``It's got more issues than a law
school.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit stems from the Enquirer's series, published in 1998,
on Chiquita's business operations. Shortly after it ran, the paper,
acknowledging that it had illegally obtained Chiquita voice-mail
messages, fired Mike Gallagher, the reporter who had broken into
the system; publicly apologized; and paid Chiquita at least $10
million in reparations.
</P>
<P>
   The purloined voice-mail messages spawned a criminal case.
During that investigation Gallagher struck a deal with the
prosecutor in which he agreed to disclose his sources. Ventura _
who is now unemployed _ ultimately pleaded no contest to charges
connected to providing access to the voice mails.
</P>
<P>
   In his breach-of-contract suit filed in US District Court in
Cincinnati, Ventura states that his cooperation ``was predicated
strictly upon the numerous, explicit and unconditional
representations of these reporters . . . that his identity as a
source of these documents and information would forever remain
anonymous and confidential.'' He claims that his ``identity as a
source'' was subsequently revealed, subjecting him to criminal
prosecution and ``great harm in his personal and professional
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher's attorney Patrick Hanley said Monday that ``as far as
Mike Gallagher is concerned, we've always maintained that there's
no breach of contract to Mr. Ventura on his behalf.'' Enquirer
president Harry Whipple issued a statement saying: ``The Enquirer
has never disclosed any information that would identify a source.
This case is without merit.'' Gannett had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a purely legal matter, (Ventura's) on good ground,''
declared Gregg Leslie, acting executive director of the Reporters
Committee for Freedom of the Press, referring to the Cohen vs.
Cowles Media precedent. In that case, public relations consultant
Dan Cohen successfully sued after he provided two Minnesota papers
with documents on a rival candidate on the condition of anonymity
and they later published his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``That certainly is a significant decision with respect to the
rights of sources,'' said Ventura's attorney Marc Mezibov.
</P>
<P>
   Mezibov says a victory for Ventura would be a boon to journalism
by reinforcing ``the integrity of relationships between sources and
newspapers. It will encourage sources to be more forthcoming.''
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts say the suit creates a dicey tradeoff between
the need to protect sources and the desire to keep the courts from
intervening in the reporting process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reporter-source agreement is not something that should be
enforced by a court of law,'' said Leslie, who is uncomfortable
with the courts ``playing editor.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Rosenstiel, director for the Project for Excellence in
Journalism, worries that the effort to ``make the negotiations with
(sources and) journalists a part of the contract law'' is part of a
growing trend for litigants ``to address press misdeeds through
legal means.''
</P>
<P>
   But even among those concerned about the court's role, there is
a recognition of the sanctity of the confidentiality agreement.
Leslie said that Ventura is ``certainly a very sympathetic case.''
</P>
<P>
   And Rosenstiel noted that that ``one fundamental public good is
that the press be able to keep watch on the powerful. To chill that
would have dire consequences. . . . If the press lies to sources,
what good are we?''

PANEL URGES PROSECUTORS TO REOPEN DNA CASES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A high-level study commission appointed by Attorney
General Janet Reno urged prosecutors across the United States on
Monday to be more amenable to reopening cases where convictions
might be overturned because of the use of DNA testing.
</P>
<P>
   The National Commission on the Future of DNA Evidence, in
effect, urged prosecutors to drop their adversarial stance in cases
in which suspects have already been convicted and sent to prison,
cases they would traditionally resist revisiting. In addition, the
commission urged prosecutors and judges to allow such cases to be
reopened even if the legally prescribed time for appeals has
expired.
</P>
<P>
   Using DNA is a ``fundamentally different proposition'' from the
usual efforts to reopen convictions with new evidence, said
Christopher Asplen, a federal prosecutor and executive director of
the commission. Prosecutors, defense lawyers and judges are
suddenly being exposed to something they have had little experience
with, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The use of DNA as a tool to acquit the innocent has produced
dramatic results, sometimes setting free people who have been
imprisoned wrongfully for years. Jane Siegelgreen, the executive
director of the Innocence Project at the Cardozo School of Law,
which tries to reopen questionable convictions, said that her group
has tallied 67 cases (62 in the United States and five in Canada)
since 1988 in which the use of DNA technology resulted in
overturned convictions.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's report suggests that prosecutors might
themselves initiate DNA testing in cases where it might overturn a
conviction. But in the typical case, in which the request comes
from a defense lawyer, the commission said that a prosecutor
``should make every effort at cooperation'' and be especially
helpful in locating and preserving tissue samples for testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prosecutors have an interest not only in exonerating the
wrongly accused but in bringing the guilty to justice,'' the report
said. ``A groundless conviction means that the real perpetrator is
still at large.''
</P>
<P>
   The message to prosecutors to accept the reopening of cases
after convictions may appear at odds with the well-established goal
of finality and closure in criminal proceedings. In practice that
means there has always been a presumption of a high threshold to
reach before cases are reopened.
</P>
<P>
   But the use of DNA technology is relatively new. Sophisticated
devices can determine whether microscopic samples of tissue, such
as skin, blood and semen, may be positively identified as coming
from a specific individual.
</P>
<P>
   ``The science involved is blind to the adversary system,'' said
Lisa Forman, a scientist who is the deputy director of the study
commission. ``This is the most dispassionate type of evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   In practice, DNA testing has been most commonly used in cases
involving rape where there is a usable semen sample available from
the victim or her clothing, Ms. Forman said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has identified different categories in which the
use of DNA testing may be used. One category that it considers the
most appropriate would involve cases like one in which a sexually
inactive girl, say 6 years old, is raped by one assailant. In such
a case, if there is a residue of semen, it could only have come
from the single rapist. And if it does not match the person
convicted, that should prove innocence.
</P>
<P>
   A different, more ambiguous scenario might involve a sexually
active woman who is raped by more than one man. The absence of the
convicted person's semen does not then conclusively prove his
innocence.
</P>
<P>
   It is in the instances identified by the commission as belonging
to category one, those in which it could be agreed in advance that
the absence of someone's DNA would prove innocence, that the
commission has urged prosecutors to be especially cooperative.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Siegelgreen of the Innocence Project said that some
prosecutors retain a traditional mind-set that once someone is
convicted, it is overwhelmingly difficult to then declare that
person innocent. She cited the case of Vincent Jenkins, who served
nearly 17 years of a life sentence in a New York state prison for a
rape he did not commit, as shown recently by DNA tests.
</P>
<P>
   The Erie County district attorney's office did not oppose his
release but has tried to block any action to undo the conviction.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is also working on a model law to recommend to
states, obliging prosecutors to reopen cases in which DNA might
overturn a conviction. Currently only New York and Illinois have
such statutes, Ms. Siegelgreen said.
</P>
<P>
   The Illinois law has led to six overturned sentences, including
some for murder, according to Larry Marshall, the Northwestern
University Law School professor who wrote the law.
</P>
<P>
   When the measure was being debated in the Illinois Legislature,
some lawmakers raised concerns that allowing for DNA-based appeals
would start an avalanche of prisoners demanding such tests. But
Marshall said that there has not been an excessive number of such
motions. Prisoners who were justifiably convicted of crimes, he
said, know that DNA tests would only underscore their guilt.
</P>
<P>
   The most famous use of DNA was in the O.J. Simpson trial.
Prosecutors in that case said that blood of Ronald Goldman, one of
the victims, was found in Simpson's vehicle, and blood from his
former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, was found on his socks. The
defense did not challenge the theory of DNA testing, but rather
raised doubts about how the samples were collected and tested by
the Los Angeles police crime lab.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is also urging better collection and testing
techniques.

UNCERTAINTY OVER SAFETY KEEPS EAST TIMOR REFUGEES IN HILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DARE, East Timor _ Bendito Freitas' daughter was born 12 days
ago in the thickly wooded mountains above East Timor's capital,
where her parents fled to escape the bloody backlash following the
landslide vote for independence. Freitas' wife gave birth on a
tarpaulin shaded by dried palm leaves, and when it was clear the
baby would survive, her parents named her Patricia, to remind them
of ``patria,'' which means ``nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Patricia was born a couple of days after the United Nations
agreed to send peacekeepers to quell the one-sided violence
fomented by pro-Indonesia security forces. Her healthy birth at a
hidden campsite away from the smoldering ruins of Dili was a clear
omen to her parents that they and their homeland would get a fresh
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-Indonesia forces ``said if they lost, blood would flow like
a river, they would destroy everything. And they did. But this is
the cost for freedom, and now that we have independence, we will
start again,'' said Freitas, 35, rural development coordinator here
for the Catholic relief agency Caritas.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as of Monday, when Indonesia's army said it transferred
power to a multinational peacekeeping force that arrived a week
ago, there were still an estimated 63,000 people like Freitas
hiding in the hills a day's hike above the capital. Distrustful of
the Indonesian military since the brutal 1975 invasion of this
former Portuguese colony, the people in the mountains _ many of
them in the same hiding places they used 24 years ago _ are too
nervous to go home, even with more than 3,000 international troops
here.
</P>
<P>
   There is reason for their skepticism. Monday, the commander of
the international force contradicted his Indonesian counterpart,
saying Indonesia remained in control of security in the province
until East Timor becomes independent, a transfer expected in
November. Indonesia's commander said he had only 1,000 troops left,
but many have disputed the constantly changing figures.
</P>
<P>
   Retreating troops have torched barracks, government offices and
utilities. Monday, patches of Dili could be seen burning from the
hills above.
</P>
<P>
   The mandate of the international force is to ensure a safe
environment so that people can return home and start rebuilding
their lives. But with Australian-led troops just beginning to move
out from the capital and Baucau, the second-largest city, it is
unclear when it will be safe for people to go back to depopulated
areas, particularly those in the volatile western part of the
territory.
</P>
<P>
   The resilience of the refugees, who have survived by foraging on
roots, leaves and flowers for a fortnight, is striking by any
measure. But the success of this peacekeeping mission will be
judged by how quickly these people feel secure enough to come down
and start constructing their new nation.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Freitas and his family are staying put, like most of
those concealed between terraced coffee plantations and wild palm
trees above the hill station of Dare. Many families started sending
down teams of men to scope out the capital and scrounge for food in
the days after the peacekeepers deployed. But most have returned,
lugging sacks of rice and telling tales of a city of burned-out
shells and new fires every day.
</P>
<P>
   Still, every day also brings good news for some: those who
venture into their charred homes or into the refugee camp in Dili's
stadium and find relatives who they feared were slaughtered by
militias and Indonesian troops.
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers have been anxious about conditions here in the
hills, but early search teams say that most people seem to have
survived, apart from the weakest elderly and already malnourished
children. Relief workers marvel at the organization of the
resistance movement centered around the Falintil guerrillas, who
have been waging a struggle from these mountains for 24 years.
</P>
<P>
   Falintil resisted the urge to fight back, telling people instead
to burrow in and survive as best they could. Its system of sentries
and regional commanders made it impractical or impossible for
militias to penetrate the hills. Pro-independence political leaders
used satellite phones throughout the two-week bloodbath to
communicate information to reporters and diplomats overseas. Even
now, the disciplined network is coming in use, as regional Falintil
commanders take charge of aid dropoffs and coordinate
distributions, using their loyalists to carry food to the neediest
in the hills.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the seeming impossibility of accounting for everyone,
the coordinator in charge of counting heads in the campsites said
foot patrols and list-takers have ticked off 63,339 people from the
farflung towns of Dili, Aileo, Liquica, Ermera and Suai who are
still in the hills.
</P>
<P>
   An hour's hike off the switchback roads that snake up from the
smoking remains of Dili, one finds around every corner huts
fashioned of woven palm leaves and tarpaulins. Strikingly, these
people seem safer and more at ease than those who have been camping
on the beach by Dili's main street or stubbornly remaining in the
burned hulks of their homes in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Independence leaders said they are concerned about tens or
hundreds of thousands of East Timorese who were forcibly moved to
West Timor and other Indonesian islands by marauding troops. There
are documented reports of East Timorese men being seized from
refugee camps and killed. And it is unclear how those who want to
return among the 200,000 people, or a quarter of the East Timorese
population now believed to be in West Timor, will be able to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Francisco Barreto, 47, the head of Caritas and a priest
whom the Vatican reported was slain, was actually secreted away in
these hills, walking miles to say Mass twice a day to refugees, and
moving camp every night.
</P>
<P>
   Barreto said he heard that the Indonesian military offered 20
million rupiah (about $2,500) to the assassins of Catholic priests,
many of whom were seen as moral pillars of the independence
movement. After men in military uniforms stormed his tiny church in
a clearing in Dare, destroying his office and killing a middle-aged
woman called Inocencia Ribeiro, Barreto guessed he was reported
dead so that some military commander could collect his bounty.
</P>
<P>
   It was reported Monday that nine people, including a priest and
two nuns, were slain on Saturday on the road from Baucau to Los
Palos, in eastern East Timor. A man who identified himself as
Father Martins told Portuguese radio that the killings were
confirmed by Baucau's bishop.
</P>
<P>
   It is stories like this that make people like Father Barreto and
the Freitas family reluctant to emerge from their hiding places
anytime soon.

 &HT;    ON THE NEWSSTANDS: `Filtering' future of book recommendations
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a special issue on fall books, The New Yorker ($3) predicts
that the era of the blockbuster best seller may be over. What we
read will be determined more by the Internet and ``collaborative
filtering,'' Malcolm Gladwell writes in ``The Science of the
Sleeper.'' With collaborative filtering, a Web site collects data
you provide about your taste in books, movies or jokes. The Web
site compares your preferences with those of thousands of other
people and suggests fresh books, movies or jokes you might like. In
effect, the Web takes the place of friendly bookstore owners. ``The
phenomenal success in recent years of Oprah Winfrey's book club,''
Gladwell writes, ``suggests that, in this age of virtually infinite
choice, readers are starved for real advice, desperate for a
recommendation from someone they know and who they feel knows
them.''
</P>
<P>
   George's future: The late John F. Kennedy Jr.'s magazine, George
($3), will wobble into the next year, but with 10 issues instead of
12 and a slowly declining circulation, now at 405,153. The October
issue, basically a tribute to the founder, features excerpts from
interviews Kennedy conducted with evangelist Billy Graham, North
Vietnamese Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap and other prominent figures. A
companion article by Inigo Thomas describes Kennedy's meeting with
Fidel Castro two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Friendly machines: For years, science fiction writers have
dreamed of robots' acting as helpful servants and concerned
companions. Now, says Discover ($4.99), that dream is closer to
reality than we may have imagined. In MIT's Artificial Intelligence
Lab, engineer Cynthia Breazeal has created a robot that responds to
bright colors and movements with humanlike emotions. At some point
robots won't just be appliances, Breazeal says; they'll be friends.
``What we're doing is putting humanity into the humanoid.''
</P>
<P>
   Centennial scrapbook: Life ($9.99) pays tribute to the 20th
century in a special-edition book, ``The Way We Were,'' a
photographic journey through everything from Adm. Robert Peary's
polar expedition to the first man on the moon. Amid the historic
pictures are ordinary images _ the first McDonald's, hot rods,
school vaccinations _ that will surely jog the memories of baby
boomers.
</P>
<P>
   The Great Communicator: Newsweek ($3.50) pairs an excerpt from
Edmund Morris' ``Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan'' with an
interview with the author, who defends his technique of using a
fictional narrator to tell the story. ``The narrator of `Dutch' is
only semifictional,'' Morris says. ``Indeed, for most of the later
parts of the book, the narrator is me, and my observations of
Ronald Reagan are direct and documented.'' Time ($3.50), however,
doesn't buy that argument. In a review of ``Dutch,'' John Stacks
criticizes Morris for resorting to ``dramatic trickery.'' The
writing is dazzling, Stacks says, but in the end ``the fact/fiction
bipolarity erodes some of the book's brilliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Like mother, like daughter: When U.S. News &AMP; World Report
($3.50) polled juvenile justice agencies in 21 states, it found
some troubling statistics. In Iowa, 64 percent of female juvenile
delinquents have mothers with criminal records. It has long been
known that sons of criminal fathers often follow them to jail, but
police and prosecutors are now seeing the same trend among women.
``A major culprit is crack,'' says reporter Toni Locy. ``It didn't
just make addicts of women; it made them criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick reads: Stuff ($3.95), a magazine for men, features
articles on the latest fashions and the newest high-tech gear, such
as waterproof CD players and vibrating shavers, and an eye-catching
photo layout of TV star Alyssa Milano. . . . And, speaking of sexy
TV stars, Entertainment Weekly ($2.99) devotes a big chunk of its
issue to Sarah Michelle Gellar and TV's ``Buffy the Vampire
Slayer.'' Included are reviews of all 56 episodes and a sneak peek
at the new season.

DUES DISAGREEMENT COULD COST U.S. ITS U.N. ASSEMBLY SEAT  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ With fewer than 100 days left before the United
States faces losing its General Assembly vote for not paying its
dues, some members of Congress said on Monday that sufficient
support exists on Capitol Hill to pay much of what is owed to the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   But they said that President Clinton as well as the Republican
leadership in Congress had to give the problem higher priority in
negotiating a budget that would begin releasing the nearly $1
billion in payments that already has been appropriated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the president is going to have to be a little more
outspoken,'' Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., said.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton presses Congress on the arrears, Shays said, ``his
efforts will pay off.'' But Shays added: ``He's going to have to
make it clear that this has to be in the budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nita M. Lowey, D-N.Y., said that Congress needs a wake-up
call. ``To be the biggest deadbeat at the U.N. is wrong, is
embarrassing, is outrageous,'' Ms. Lowey said.
</P>
<P>
   Shays and Ms. Lowey visited the United Nations on Monday to
focus attention on paying the American debt to the world
organization. They were joined by Rep. Eliot L. Engel, another New
York Democrat, and Rep. Tony Hall, D-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of August, the United States had run up $1.739
billion in unpaid dues and other assessments, according to Joseph
E. Connor, the U.N. undersecretary for management. By the end of
September, he said, he expected some American payments to trim the
arrears to $1.546 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Washington estimates that it owes $1.025 billion, the amount
that Congress and the administration agreed to set aside.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining $521 million in dispute includes $324 million in
differences over how much the United States should be assessed for
peacekeeping missions, $97 million in costs that the United States
has refused to pay for its own policy reasons, and $100 million
tied up in a dispute about double taxation of Americans employed by
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Charter says that member states whose arrears total
more than their assessed dues for two years automatically lose
their vote in the General Assembly, which could happen on Jan. 1,
2000.

 &HT;    NHL's new OT policy not a favorite among ThrashersBy Jeff
Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The reaction was what you would expect from a
goaltender just subjected to an NHL-aided two-on-one break.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not real happy with the new rule,'' the Thrashers' Damian
Rhodes said about the break by the Rangers' Theo Fleury and Valeri
Kamensky. ``I like five on five better.'' The latest rule change
designed to open up the game and increase scoring borders on
gimmick. Teams tied at the end of regulation will play the
five-minute, overtime with only four skaters each, plus the goalie,
creating more room on the ice and presumably more scoring chances.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams will be guaranteed a point in the standings, perhaps
making them less fearful of losing that point in the overtime and
more willing to go for the win.
</P>
<P>
   NHL commissioner Gary Bettman orchestrated the change after 27
percent of the games that went into overtime last season _ 60 of
222 _ ended in one team winning. In the past five seasons, 28.6
percent of overtime games concluded in a victory, down from 34.5
the previous five years.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL experimented with the four-on-four rule in the American
Hockey League for the final 44 games last season, and the change
was significant. The AHL had 33 percent of its overtime games
decided before the rule, 61.4 percent after it. The AHL already had
been awarding one point to each team tied after regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction among players generally is mixed. Rhodes, who
allowed a goal to Kamensky two minutes into overtime of an
exhibition game at Philips Arena, understandably felt safer under
the old rules.
</P>
<P>
   Thrashers center Ray Ferraro also said he the league went too
far. ``I don't like it,'' he said. ``I understand why they're doing
it. But to me, if you're trying to gimmick it up for a little more
excitement, play a five-minute overtime five on five. Then if it's
still tied have a shootout. Fans like that better, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   But wing Andrew Brunette said, ``It's going to make things a lot
more exciting. If you didn't do something, the overtimes were going
to be just like killing penalties for five minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   The new rule probably will favor teams deep in skill players,
such as Colorado, or with enough superstars to carry them for five
minutes, such as the Rangers. Colorado and Dallas, whose forwards
also are excellent defensively, could play four forwards.
</P>
<P>
   But the rule seemingly does not help the Thrashers, given the
apparent lack of goal-scorers on the roster. Ferraro did not say
that the rule would hurt the team, but he said, ``We're going to
have to work for our goals, whether it's five on five or four on
four. We don't want to get into a situation where we're trading
chances.''
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers have played two overtime games in the preseason _
the 3-2 loss to New York and a 3-3 tie in St. Louis. In the
newfanged NHL standings, their record is 3-2-1-1 _
wins-losses-ties-regulation ties _ for eight points.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's strategy in overtime games, and that of most teams,
will depend on the opponent. If the Thrashers are playing an
Eastern Conference opponent, they probably will lean toward
conservatism, for fear of giving an extra point in the standings to
another team in the playoff race. But those concerns would be
erased against Western teams, given the postseason format.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we play the Western teams, we'll probably go for it,''
coach Curt Fraser said. ``You figure you've got the point already
and you've got nothing to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Thrashers right wing Kelly Buchberger said he would prefer that
the NHL merely have two teams play a five-on-five overtime ``until
somebody scores.'' But then he thought better of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``With scoring down,'' Buchberger said, ``I guess we could be
playing all night.''
</P>
<P>
   NHL TRYING TO BREAK TIES
</P>
<P>
   _ The rule change: Beginning this season, teams that are tied at
the end of regulation will be assured of one point in the
standings. The teams will play a five-minute, sudden-death overtime
period with a goalie but only four skaters, instead of five. If
neither team scores, the game will end a tie. If one team scores,
that team will be awarded a win and two points in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ramifications: League officials say that assuring teams at
least one point by reaching overtime will lead them to be more
aggressive in the extra period. And the four-on-four skating is
expected to make the overtime more open.
</P>
<P>
   _ Who it helps or hurts: The fast-skating, highly skilled teams,
such as Colorado and Toronto, and those with a handful of talented
scorers, including the New York Rangers, figure to do well in
overtime. The slower teams and those short on scoring talent might
have difficulty keeping pace four on four. The Thrashers could fall
into the second category.
</P>
<P>
   _ New look for standings: The NHL standings this year will have
four categories for a team's record: wins, losses, ties, regulation
ties. For example, the Thrashers are 3-2-1-1 in exhibitions.

THE CREW MAKES A BOAT A YACHT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 3) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Basically, what I am is a matchmaker,'' said Sandy Carney, who
manages yacht charters for the Alden Group in Jamestown, R.I. Ms.
Carney, whose venerable organization sells and charters the output
of many builders along with designing and building Alden yachts,
regularly visits the major charter shows here and abroad, checking
out the boats and most particularly their crews. She wants to be
sure crew personalities will fit with those of her clients.
</P>
<P>
   Experienced yachters often want to sail and navigate themselves,
but others may want someone else to set the course, do the cooking
and rev up the dinghy. The charterers can decide to moor in one
agreeable harbor or visit many; the crew's task is to get them
there enjoyably.
</P>
<P>
   Bad chemistry between passengers and crew can sour a charter
faster than almost anything. If you rent a house in the Caribbean
and do not like the gardener, avoid the garden; on a yacht charter,
there is no way to walk away. Ms. Sanderson spends a big proportion
of her time talking to boat owners or the professionals whose
services are part of the charter price.
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Stewart of Roswell, Ga., president of the Charter Yacht
Brokers Association, said that crew quality was so important that
contracts permitted cancellation by the broker if the crew was
changed.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a ``bare boat,'' one without a crew, there should be a
local presence to help in difficulty. A few years ago, my sister,
brother-in-law and two friends chartered a 40-foot sailboat in
Greece, using the Moorings, a broker with offices around the world.
When the two weeks were nearly up, my relatives, experienced
sailors, found themselves on Mykonos in high winds that they could
not handle.
</P>
<P>
   They called the broker in Athens, who took the ferry over. They
met him on the dock, turned over the keys and rode the ferry to
Piraeus. There was no extra charge.
</P>
<P>
   The yachts offered by brokers sleep 2 to 20. Some boats can make
long ocean passages, but typically they go island-hopping in the
Caribbean or the Bahamas. Family groups are common. Charter brokers
do not put together groups; chartering is like renting a beach
cottage for yourself and friends.
</P>
<P>
   Rates vary widely, but a boat under 75 feet, with a crew of two,
is likely to cost $10,000 a week. In August, I looked at luxurious
``megayachts'' offered by Bob Saxon Associates. These 100-foot
villas of the ocean, white carpets and all, run $55,000 to $60,000
a week for 10 passengers. Whether these prices include provisions
mostly depends on the custom of the area of the charter.
</P>
<P>
   The yacht charter business is unregulated. But three major
associations of brokers have set criteria for membership and
recommendations for keeping the clients' money safe, usually in
escrow accounts. These are the Charter Yacht Brokers Association,
with 65 members, of which Ms. Stewart is president; the American
Yacht Charter Association, with 22 members, who sell only crewed
charters, of which Tina Hinckley of Southwest Harbor, Maine, is
president, and the Mediterranean Yacht Brokers Association, with 82
members, whose president, Alex Braden, is based in London.
</P>
<P>
   The membership criteria require that the broker have been in
business for a certain time: three years for the Mediterranean
group, five for Charter Yacht Brokers, seven for the American Yacht
Charter Association. The broker must have a good reputation among
colleagues who approve the membership.
</P>
<P>
   The most important requirement is that brokers offer only
vessels they have seen. All three groups require that the brokers
attend several major charter shows a year _ in Europe, the
Caribbean and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Yacht brokers say they seldom deal with travel agents, even
though they are willing to share the 15 percent commissions. The
brokers deal directly with clients, usually by phone and fax,
coaxing out details on preferences.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Ms. Stewart said, she would not charter a boat for
herself if the crew members smoked. She likes to dive; her husband
hopes the owner will let him steer the boat for a while. The
abilities of the chef are more important to some clients than to
others.
</P>
<P>
   One of Ms. Carney's favorite boats is the Shellette, a 55-foot
catamaran sloop in the British Virgin Islands that is almost
completely booked for the winter. Shellette has four cabins to
accommodate eight and is sailed by the owners, Mike and Pam
Donnelly, the captain and first mate-chef. In winter, the boat
costs $11,900 a week, including all expenses except for phone
calls. In the low season, the price is $10,900.
</P>
<P>
   Food and liquor, except for champagne and exotic liquors, are
part of the Caribbean contracts. Crew tips, usually 15 percent of
the cost, are not, said Ms. Carney, whose company has been around
since 1909. In the Mediterranean, the 54-foot sloop Daphne's Smile,
as an example, costs $9,100 a week for six, but few expenses are
included.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, a charter requires a 50 percent payment in advance _
how far in advance depends on the popularity of the vessel. The
rules for protecting clients' deposits vary, and Ms. Hinckley said
that her group was pressing the Caribbean yacht organizations not
to release all the escrowed money to the boat owners before the
charter starts.
</P>
<P>
   These customs can vary even by country, so it is important for a
client to learn these details and to ask about trip-cancellation
insurance. Cancellation by the client will probably mean forfeit of
the deposit, although if the boat can be rebooked, all but the
broker's commission will probably be returned.
</P>
<P>
   Twice a year, in September and March, Yachting magazine
publishes a long list of brokers. All are either members of at
least one of the trade groups, or are Yachting advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   This month, the magazine is putting out a separate publication,
Vacations Afloat, with broker and boat listings and articles,
costing $5. Yachting also has a Web site, www.yachtingnet.com,
which Kenny Wooton, editor in chief of the magazine, said was being
upgraded. &QL;

 DOLE TELLS STUDENTS ABOUT HER FOREIGN POLICY PLATFORM 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ The seats were taken and so the
undergraduates plunked down in the center aisles, and when those
filled they lined up along the walls and then across the back. A
heavily female crowd turned up Monday to hear Elizabeth Dole
outline her foreign policy platform in an auditorium at the College
of Charleston, drawn more by the marvel of a woman running
seriously for president than by the subject of her speech.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking a week after Gov. George W. Bush of Texas delivered his
own foreign policy address at the Citadel, the city's legendary
military academy famous for its efforts to bar women, Mrs. Dole
covered many of the same themes as Bush, the front-runner for the
Republican Party's presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Invoking former President Reagan, whom she credited with
bringing down communism, Mrs. Dole proposed a kind of post-Cold War
weapons buildup to reinforce the country's nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   She described the current administration as being taken in by
the ``empty promises'' of weak treaties, and by ``rogue and outlaw
nations'' threatening the United States with weapons of mass
destruction. She criticized aid to Russia, saying the money had
``disappeared into offshore accounts and the wallets of Russian
officials,'' while ``the Russian people suffer.'' Her own
administration, she said, would work with ``policies, not
personalities,'' an implicit slap at the White House for propping
up the increasingly discredited president of Russia, Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Coming a few days after Mrs. Dole delivered a policy speech on
education, the foreign policy speech Monday appeared to be an
attempt to lend heft to a campaign in which Mrs. Dole keeps
soldiering on despite Bush's daunting financial advantage. The Bush
campaign has so far collected $52 million; Mrs. Dole would not say
how much she had collected.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bush, Mrs. Dole vowed to increase military spending and
abandon the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, criticizing an
administration that, she said, ``failed to develop a strong
national or theater missile defense system.''
</P>
<P>
   She also opposed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which she
called ``neither effective nor verifiable.'' The treaty, which bans
nuclear test explosions, was signed by President Clinton in
September 1996, but has not been ratified by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole also criticized the administration for treating China
as a ``strategic partner'' despite its human rights violations and
its development of advanced weapons systems that, she said, could
threaten the United States. She said China ``imprisons and
persecutes dissidents and religious believers. It employs prison
labor. It steals our nuclear and other military secrets.''
</P>
<P>
   However, it was not clear how the ``two-track policy'' she
proposed, to promote open markets and political reforms in the
communist nation, would differ from current policy objectives. She
pledged that, under a Dole administration, ``throughout the world,
the United States will treat authoritarian and totalitarian states,
such as North Korea, as rogue regimes, not as our equals,'' and
that ``We will encourage and strengthen democratic oppositions
within these countries wherever possible.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bush attempted to build credibility for his foreign policy
platform by listing experts he consulted in preparing it, Mrs. Dole
spoke of a trip she made to Poland in 1989 when she served as
secretary of labor for her rival's father, President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   She reminds audiences that as secretary of transportation under
Ronald Reagan, she became the first woman to head a branch of the
armed forces _ the Coast Guard. And on Monday, she spoke of trips
she had made to Somalia, Bosnia and Croatia as head of the American
Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Several women who turned out to hear Mrs. Dole said they did not
normally keep up with political issues, but grew interested when
teachers mentioned that Mrs. Dole would be speaking here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the whole idea of her being the first woman running
for president,'' Laura Bogan, a senior majoring in business and
marketing, said. ``I think it's just kind of neat that she's
running.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, however, Ms. Bogan said she did not usually keep up
with foreign affairs, and so did not understand much of Mrs. Dole's
speech. And though she voted for Bob Dole in 1996, she remained
unconvinced after listening to Mrs. Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Several students apparently had not been told that the speech
would focus on foreign policy, and so appeared disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Sharniqua Austin, a sophomore studying biology who recorded the
speech, said she wanted to hear Mrs. Dole talk about domestic
issues. ``I was wondering about the state of the U.S., like what
she thought about things here, as opposed to things in other
countries,'' she said.

held in a regard that approaches reverence. In Spanish Harlem, he's
been referred to as ``a flame that walks.''
</P>
<P>
   But the largest-selling salsa singer in the world didn't catch
fire immediately. Growing up in New York City, Anthony got started
singing in English as a teen in underground clubs specializing in
the minimal electronic dance music known as house, in which a
singer, used merely as another textural instrument, repeats a
phrase over and over with slight variations to the accompaniment of
a pre-recorded rhythm track.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, percussionist and band leader Tito Puente asked Anthony
to open his revue at Madison Square Garden. After appearing in
front of such a large crowd, Anthony lost his appetite for clubs
and a year later transformed a song made popular by Latin superstar
Juan Gabriel into a salsa number.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, he began recording a string of
multi-million-selling salsa albums, ``Otra Nota (Another Tune),''
``Todo a Su Tiempo (All in Time)'' and ``Contra la Corriente
(Against the Flow),'' which snagged the best tropical Latin
performance Grammy this year.
</P>
<P>
   Other audiences took note of Anthony in 1997 when he was the
first actor cast in Paul Simon's short-lived Broadway musical,
``The Capeman.'' Simon had gone to a Latin record store and asked
for examples of the best young salsa singers around.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave me two or three guys and I listened to (Anthony) and
thought, `This is good ... really good,''' Simon said. ``In fact,
he was clearly the best.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, the skinny kid from a crowded working-class home in
East Harlem is about to explode. Last year, Columbia signed Anthony
to a multirecord contract worth more than $30 million. He's
returning to singing in English, and his hotly anticipated
self-titled collection of love songs goes on sale today.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, the 31-year-old singer has a high-profile role
with Nicolas Cage in Martin Scorsese's ``Bringing Out the Dead,''
opening Oct. 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just great,'' Scorsese said. ``He has this great face
and eyes, a very small build. He'd never done anything quite like
(the part as a deranged street person) before. It was a very
physically demanding performance.''
</P>
<P>
   We met Anthony while he was in town to talk about the Scorsese
film.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's your take on the number of Latino performers,
including Ricky Martin and Jennifer Lopez, who've suddenly been
anointed hot?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't know what we're crossing over from or to. We've been
here all along. It's so disappointing the lack of education as far
as our culture is concerned. Latin music is Latin music, and what I
recorded on this album and what Ricky recorded on his album and
what Jennifer recorded on her album does not represent Latin music
at all. It's pop music and the only common denominator is we're all
Puerto Rican. And I've heard it all, starting with, ``Wow, you
people are ...'' Like we're aliens or something.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you think this trend has been portrayed?
</P>
<P>
   A: If I see another article with a jalapeno pepper next to my
name or a set of maracas or a sombrero or the words muy caliente
... you know what I'm saying?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has too much been made of the ethnicity of these performers? &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; A: I don't want to be known as ``that Puerto Rican pop
singer.'' What does Puerto Rican have to do with it? I'm proud to
be Puerto Rican, but it's not all there is. You have to be in my
shoes to know what it feels like. It's almost like you don't belong
in your own back yard. Or you're stepping into someone else's
world. It's like, ``Here they come, here they come.'' But it's all
a matter of educating people. We're all Latin performers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does your new ballads album represent your taste in music? &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; A: I was born and raised Puerto Rican _ very Puerto Rican _ and
American, so I'm bicultural. For the last 7{ years, I've been
tapping into the Latin side of it. And it's been a trip. I've seen
some amazing things. I've also tapped into other influences _ being
born and raised in New York as American as the next one. This album
truly represents my taste in music and where I'm at as a man, an
artist and a father (of a 5-year-old girl) _ as everything.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who have been your main influences musically? &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; A: Paul Simon and Ruben Blades, who's my absolute all-time
idol. I was his water boy when I was 15 on tour. I was in charge of
the water. And I sat back and had the pleasure and honor to be in
the same room as Paul Simon as he wrote the songs (for ``Capeman'')
and he'd throw ideas at me. We developed this rhythm where my
opinion became important. He became one of my closest friends. It
was amazing. The realization that I'd learned enough to be
respected by those I respected was sobering. I have nothing but
incredible things to say of the whole experience.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How was your acting experience in ``Bringing Out the Dead''?
</P>
<P>
   A: Acting and singing come from the same place. It's all about
storytelling at the end of the day. It just takes different
techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It's been predicted your latest album will do very well in
terms of sales. Does that part of it concern you? &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; A: I handed in the record and said, ``I'm in the business of
making records. You guys who sell records, do what you've gotta
do.'' But you're looking at one satisfied human being. I couldn't
be happier.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's next for you? &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; A: I'm going to record two albums _ a salsa one and a
Spanish-rock album. And a world tour.!end! &QL;

   MITROVICA, Yugoslavia _ French police serving as peacekeep- ers
in Kosovo on Monday notified the families of 26 men missing from
this town for five months that the men had been killed by Serbs and
dumped in a mass grave, and that four suspects have been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The case is the first time in Kosovo that foreigners have
completed a war-crimes investigation, working from the first
reports of missing people to finding the graves and making arrests.
Their speed demonstrates a greater commitment than was the case in
the former Yugoslavia to catch those responsible for war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The killings occurred on April 14, when, according to the
French, the Serbian police forced families out from their
apartments on Popovic Street and separated the men from their wives
and children. Minutes later, after the others in the families had
been ordered to flee, the men were all executed. Their bodies were
dumped in a grave 10 miles away, outside the Serbian town of
Zvecan. Investigators from the War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague,
who have been digging up the bodies this week, have established
that they were the men from Popovic Street.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the relatives reconciled themselves to the news.
``They are dead for sure,'' said Sala Meha, a peasant in a head
scarf, whose two brothers and nephew were among those missing.
``Seven of them had identification papers on them, including
Rexhep,'' she said, naming one of her brothers.
</P>
<P>
   The news ended a three-month investigation by the French.
``Usually, the bodies are found first,'' spokesman for the French
forces here, Lt. Col. Philippe Tanguy, said. ``This time, it was
the other way around. We followed a judicial process, with a
judge's issuing warrants, and eventually one of the witnesses
brought in for questioning revealed where the bodies were.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most important witnesses were children of the
victims. ``The special police came and kicked in the door,'' said
Naila Sejdiu who was at home at noon on April 14 with her husband
and five children, as well as a brother-in-law and a nephew who had
been chased from their own apartment days before.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ordered us out,'' Ms. Sejdiu recalled on Monday. ``In the
street, paramilitaries put all the children to one side. They lay
all the men face down on the street. They were shooting in the air.
Our men were beaten on the head, because they were looking
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Gesturing to her son Besnik, 20, Ms. Sejdiu said, ``He is the
only man of his age who survived, who was not taken.''
</P>
<P>
   Crouched down and surrounded by his sisters and younger
brothers, Besnik Sejdiu managed to avoid the gaze of the police.
</P>
<P>
   From where he hid against a shop window, Sejdiu could see his
father, uncle and cousin among the men on the ground in an alley.
Watching over them with an automatic rifle was a Serbian neighbor,
Serzen Aleksic, the Albanians contend. The man was masked. But
Sejdiu said that he knew the man well, because they used to play
basketball together, and that he had recognized him instantly, as
did his sister Mirvete, 16.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were all there,'' Sejdiu said of his Serbian neighbors.
Some held Kalashnikov rifles, and some held hammers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs were masked, but some of the Albanians knew them by
their physiques, Sejdiu said. Aleksic ``was a very nervous guy,
always moving his arms and his legs,'' Sejdiu recounted, adding,
``You could recognize him from his movements.''
</P>
<P>
   After having been turned out of their houses, the family members
fled and began a frantic four-day flight on foot as far as the
Albanian border, only to be sent back, the said. For two months
they roamed from village to village, trying to escape Serbian
forces, all the time wondering what had happened to the men of the
family.
</P>
<P>
   When the townspeople returned in June and when NATO forces
arrived, they found no trace of the men. Neighbors began to report
the missing to the gendarmes. Besieged by crowds of 150 people a
day, the gendarmes began an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   It was painstaking work matching the testimonies, but gradually,
the gendarmes said, there was enough evidence to pinpoint several
Serbs who were living here, having moved to the Serbian district on
the northern side of the river that divides the town.
</P>
<P>
   The gendarmes have arrested four suspects, according to Tanguy.
Among them were Aleksic, and his father, Vlasta, a Serbian daily,
Blic, has reported.
</P>
<P>
   One man called in for questioning tipped the police to the
burial site, investigators said. He had not taken part in the
killing, but was ordered to bury the men, and he drew a map for the
gendarmes. After a few hours' search they found the graves.
</P>
<P>
   This week, as the bodies were exhumed, the facts emerged about
their deaths. On Monday morning the local judge and the gendarmes
gathered the families and told them that seven men had been killed
by knives or bayonets. It is still unclear how the rest died, but
some had bullet wounds, Ms. Sejdiu said.
</P>
<P>
   She has been asked to return on Tuesday to identify the clothes
of her husband and relatives, she said, adding: ``And we don't know
what will happen, when we will get the bodies, and where will we
bury them. The cemetery is on the Serbian side, in Zvecan.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight bodies were found, more than had been expected, and
the suspects continue to be interrogated. The reported leader
remains unidentified, said Tanguy.

TRIAL OPENS FOR PINOCHET WITH LISTING OF 35 CRIMES 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Lawyers arguing that Gen. Augusto Pinochet should be
extradited to Spain to stand trial on torture charges said at a
hearing Monday that he faces ``some of the most serious allegations
of crime ever to come before English criminal courts.''
</P>
<P>
   The 35 charges, which took the clerk of the court 15 minutes to
read in a steady monotone, include allegations of beating, burning,
caging, binding, starving, sodomizing and suspending victims when
he was the Chilean dictator.
</P>
<P>
   The list covers the enforced use of hallucinogenic drugs,
threats of rape and disfigurement and the use of electric shocks on
a 17-year-old youth, leading to his death. In one case, a woman was
said to have been interrogated while she was naked, and threats
were made to attack her 9-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet, 83, who is under house arrest in the London suburbs,
was not at Bow Street Magistrates Court for the start of the week
of hearings, but he will be required to appear next month when the
judge, Ronald Bartle, issues his ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet has said he was not responsible for what others might
have done, and a Scotland Yard official testified Monday that the
general rejected allegations of torture read to him at his rented
house in April during the presentation of a formal arrest warrant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't agree with this,'' the police officer, Detective
Inspector Andrew Hewitt, quoted Pinochet as saying. ``I had
absolutely nothing to do with any of these charges. All these
charges, I completely negate them.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt said that Pinochet continued: ``I am being humiliated. I
am a general, 64 years' service. I'm a gentleman who knows about
honor. Don't worry, I'm not going to comply with this. That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chanting and flag-waving supporters of Pinochet outnumbered
opponents outside the court in downtown London, but it was the
anti-Pinochet faction that took heart from the day's proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is that for the first time a head of
state is the subject of an extradition hearing,'' said Juan Garces,
55, a Spanish lawyer who was an adviser to Salvador Allende, the
president ousted in the 1973 coup that brought Pinochet to power.
</P>
<P>
   Reed Brody, advocacy director of Human Rights Watch, said many
victims of the Pinochet years had waited 25 years for this moment.
``For the Crown prosecutors to formally read out the charges of
torture and conspiracy against General Pinochet and to utter the
names of people who were killed, tortured or disappeared by his
regime has given them a form of justice for all their suffering,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   All the alleged crimes were said to have occurred after 1988,
the period declared relevant for the extradition case by England's
highest court in a March decision that threw out nearly 3,000
charges of murder, kidnapping and crimes against humanity and
reduced the scope of the case to torture and conspiracy to torture.
It was in 1988 that torture overseas became a crime punishable in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet was arrested in London last Oct. 16 on an extradition
request by Baltasar Garzon, a Spanish magistrate investigating the
so-called dirty wars in Latin America in the 1970s. The case has
been through a number of rulings and appeals involving this
country's highest tribunal, the Law Lords of the House of Lords,
and leading to Monday's session.
</P>
<P>
   Bartle will rule solely on whether the Spanish petition is in
order and whether the alleged crimes are extraditable ones under
British law. Under the European Convention on Extradition, Spain
does not have to offer any evidence to support the charges.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Alun Jones, the British lawyer representing the Spanish
prosecutors, noted that the 1984 Convention Against Torture _ which
Britain has ratified, as has Spain and Chile _ was incorporated
into the law of the United Kingdom in December 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not engaged in these proceedings in consideration to
some broad, sweeping rhetorical declaration of international
intent,'' he said. He declared that the matter under consideration
was now ``black-lettered U.K. law.''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, he added, it was ``simply facile'' to contend
that the charges are a matter for Chile and no one else. The
general's supporters contend that Chile is the proper place for him
to be judged, and in his only court appearance since his arrest,
Pinochet told a bail hearing in December that he did not recognize
any court other than a Chilean one to pass judgment on him.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' assertion of international law and jurisdiction in the
case anticipated a challenge from Pinochet's lawyers later this
week of Spain's right to try him because none of the alleged
victims were themselves Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The allegations against General Pinochet do indeed constitute
some of the most serious allegations of crime ever to come before
an English court,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   He also argued that the court could consider ``disappearances''
that occurred before the 1988 date as conspiracy to torture
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our case that the continuing offense of conspiracy to
torture after December 1988 has, as one of its objects, that the
fate of these people would continue to be concealed from families
causing severe mental pain, suffering and demoralization,'' Jones
said.

FOR SAN FRANCISCO OPERA'S NEXT DIRECTOR, A HOMECOMING OF SORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSHUA KOSMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO &LR;   &LR; _ Pamela Rosenberg has spent her entire career
in Europe, but when she becomes general director of the San
Francisco Opera in August 2001, she'll be returning to the company
where she first fell in love with opera.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Francisco is where my roots are,'' she said Monday from
her office at the Stuttgart Opera, where she's been co-director
since 1991. ``From 1962 to 1966 I saw every single production
there, and it's where I got my first taste for opera.''
</P>
<P>
   In those days the Los Angeles-born Rosenberg was an
undergraduate at the University of California at Berkeley, studying
history while pursuing a burgeoning interest in music. Now, at 54,
she's poised to become the only woman running a major American
opera company.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment became official Monday, when the board named
Rosenberg the company's fifth general director. She will succeed
Lotfi Mansouri, who has held the post since 1988 and in February
announced his decision to step down.
</P>
<P>
   Board President William W. Godward said the board had approved
the appointment without reservation. ``We were looking for someone
with artistic knowledge and experience in actually putting opera on
stage, and (Rosenberg) had them both,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, a large part of Rosenberg's appeal was her
combination of American background and European experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a European administrator, I have something to bring to the
American scene _ particularly when it comes to showing some of the
visual and psychological exploration that has been going on in
Europe over the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm also an American, and I'm tuned in to American
sensibilities. So even though I'm known for having done some
adventurous theatrical work, they know that I will be sensitive to
what I bring to San Francisco. I'm not going to come in and shove
radical things down their throats.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Mansouri, Rosenberg started her career as a director,
although she gave it up when she became an administrator (``I was
solid, but to direct you have to be better than that''). She went
to Europe in 1966 to study at Bayreuth, then at the Guildhall
School of Music and Drama in London.
</P>
<P>
   Her formative experience, though, was her stint from 1977 to
1987 at the Frankfurt Opera under the innovative music director
Michael Gielen. That was where she acquired her commitment to the
adventurous theatrical style that has marked her Stuttgart tenure
and that she considers a distinctively European value.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about being in Europe, and Germany in particular, is
that there are so many opera houses. Within one hour's train ride
of Stuttgart there are seven houses, and within an hour's flight
there are too many to count. And the fact that you can see so many
different productions of `Fidelio,' say, means that you can comment
on the piece or explore different aspects of it, instead of
producing something definitive that will stay around for the next
20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American approach is more like preserving a piece frozen
in time, whereas exploration in Europe tends to develop much more
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rosenberg's track record in Stuttgart extends to repertoire as
well, with productions of operas by such modernist masters as Luigi
Nono and Wolfgang Rihm, as well as commissions to younger
composers. ``I do think this is a living art form, and part of our
mission is to present the substantial works of our time. But I also
have the full intention of tapping the artists and composers of the
Bay Area, most obviously John Adams.''
</P>
<P>
   She also expressed interest in trying to pull off the
long-overdue American stage premiere of ``Saint Fran &LR; c &LR; ois
d'Assise,'' the towering 1983 magnum opus of the late Olivier
Messiaen.
</P>
<P>
   A project like that, of course, depends on financing, which is
where Rosenberg _ accustomed to the generous artistic subsidies
provided by the Germans _ may face her stiffest challenge. But she
sounds undaunted. ``It's true that I haven't had to go out and do
lots of fund raising here,'' she says, ``but I know what I'm
facing. I'm an American _ I know my Californians.''

DON'T DRESS FOR DINNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., Oct. 3)  
(jt) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   During a fall and winter cruise season in which discounts
abound, in which more ships will sail from more ports than ever and
in which there will be a plethora of new ships, it may not seem
especially newsworthy that beginning this month Silversea Cruises
has revised its dress code for passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the revision also explains why, as the year 2000 draws
nearer, there are so many discounts, so many new ports and why when
Royal Caribbean's new Voyager of the Seas begins it Caribbean
cruises from Miami in November, it will have berths for 3,100
passengers. It is also the reason industry officials speak
hopefully of attracting 6 million passengers this year, up from
last year's record 5.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   But first things first. And for most cruise aficionados, that
means anything in the way of discounts and new ports of call. This
fall, winter and spring there are plenty of both. Crystal Cruises
alone is adding new calls in 60 countries and territories,
including Easter Island, Pitcairn Island and Abidjan, Ivory Coast.
</P>
<P>
   As for discounts, Cunard and Seabourn Cruise Line, both owned by
Carnival Corp., are offering big reductions this fall on business
class air fare for select Mediterranean cruises. In addition,
Cunard is offering free passage between New York or Miami and San
Francisco via the Panama Canal for passengers who buy the New York
or Miami segments to Hong Kong, Bombay or Singapore. And fares for
most Cunard cruises next year will average 20 percent less than in
1999, to bring them more in line with prices at resorts.
</P>
<P>
   Couples sailing on Costa Cruises' seven-night Caribbean cruises
can save up to $1,000 if they book at least 120 days ahead.
Passengers who book any cruise of a week or more in the new year on
the Delta Queen, Mississippi Queen or American Queen will receive
free round-trip air fare. Discounts of up to $2,000 off published
rates are available on two World Cruise Co. voyages beginning next
March, including $500 a person for a 110-day cruise from the
Antarctic to the Arctic.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller ships are also offering a variety of discounts. Lindblad
Special Expeditions will take 20 percent off the total voyage cost
for passengers who book any two consecutive voyages next year
aboard its Caledonian Star. Silversea Cruises will give repeat
passengers 15 percent off both its millennium voyages, as well as
free first-class air fare for certain other cruises. The Radisson
Diamond and the company's new Seven Seas Navigator are offering 50
percent savings off the second-person fare for an array of cruises
between Nov. 20 and May 10. And Clipper Cruise Line's 17-day
cruises from Australia and New Zealand include free round-trip air
fare from Los Angeles to each country.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that cruise discounts are not always what they
seem. While most advertised discount fares doubtless result in
savings, most are also larded with restrictions, and markdowns are
generally off fares listed in the brochures, which few passengers
pay.
</P>
<P>
   No one is quite sure why there are so many discounts so far in
advance of the sailings, especially with the strong economy. But
there is some concern that without them, many people will wait to
book until well after the millennium, when prices return to normal.
There is also industry concern that another mild winter will dampen
enthusiasm for sailing to the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Others attribute the discounts to fear of a delayed backlash
resulting from the $18 million fine imposed on Royal Caribbean this
summer for having dumped hazardous chemicals and oil from nine
ships in coastal waters around the United States, then trying to
cover up. Worse, the $18 million fine came just two years after
Royal Caribbean was fined $9 million after pleading guilty to nine
counts of dumping, and after promising to stop polluting. This
summer also, Carnival Cruise Lines disclosed in court that in the
five years ended last August, members of its crews had been accused
of sexually assaulting passengers or fellow workers 62 times _ a
number since raised to more than 100. In addition, Carnival's
Tropicale was disabled by a fire in the engine room Sept. 18 in the
Gulf of Mexico, forcing it to return to Port Manatee, 30 miles from
Tampa. (The cruise line said it planned to resume sailings of the
vessel Oct. 18; passengers were offered alternative cruises,
refunds, future discounts and transportation.) This fire followed
one on Carnival's Ecstasy last year.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One of the more significant changes in the industry is the
expansion to nontraditional cities and ports. In just a few years
Boston has grown from a mini-cruise port to the home port for the
Norwegian Majesty. Last year it received 62 ship visits; this year
it will receive 80, by ships large and small _ from the Royal
Caribbean's Splendour of the Seas with more than 2,000 passengers
to the Silversea's Silver Cloud with 296 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The Carnival Destiny has scheduled three cruises from Boston
next spring, as well as a one-night cruise and a five-day cruise to
the Bahamas from both Charleston, S.C., and Newport News, Va.
Carnival will also sail from Texas for the first time, beginning
next October, with year-round cruises from Galveston to the western
Caribbean on the 1,486-passenger Celebration. Next May, Premier
Cruises' Island Breeze will sail to Veracruz, Cozumel and Playa del
Carmen from Houston, which is also the home port for the Norwegian
Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Also in May, the Norwegian Sky will begin seven-day cruises to
Alaska from Seattle, while Royal Caribbean's 2,000-passenger Vision
of the Seas will offer a total of six cruises between Seattle and
the Canadian cities of Victoria and Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   When Commodore Cruise Lines' new Crown Dynasty begins cruises to
Bermuda next spring, 18 will depart from Philadelphia and the
remaining four from Baltimore. More than 22 ships from nine lines
will call at San Diego next year, including Holland America's
1,260-passenger Statendam and Carnival's first ever cruises from
San Diego to the Baja peninsula (or, as the cruise industry insists
on calling it, the Mexican Riviera). The main reason for this
expansion is to attract passengers within a driving distance of
about 200 miles, and to be able to schedule more of the shorter
cruises that are so popular. Two million passengers are expected on
more than 1,300 cruises of five days or less this year, according
to the Cruise Lines International Association, compared with 1.7
million passengers last year.
</P>
<P>
   Cruises to Europe and the Mediterranean continue to grow in
popularity, largely because of the chance to combine a cruise with
visits to many cultural and historic treasures. This year's
sailings to the region will number 1,730, 16 percent more than
last, and Crystal Symphony's Mediterranean sailings this month will
include lectures on art and architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Theme cruises also remain popular, including jazz and big band
themes, lectures about nutrition and almost anything about sports.
The Norwegian Sea's baseball cruise to the Western Caribbean
beginning Nov. 28 will include such former greats as Bob Feller
(Cleveland Indians), Ralph Kiner (Pittsburgh Pirates) and Billy
Williams (Chicago Cubs). For the first time, it will include two
former greats from the All-American Girls Professional Baseball
League _ Pepper Paire and Lefty Hohlmayer _ that was the subject of
the 1992 film ``A League of Their Own.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, about Silversea's revised dress code. Women will still be
required to wear gowns or cocktail dresses during ``formal''
nights, of which there are three on a typical 11-day sailing, and
men will still have to wear tuxedos, dinner jackets or dark suits.
But on the five ``informal'' evenings on such a cruise, women can
opt for short dresses, or pants suits, while men can dispense with
the tie, and on ``casual'' nights, of which there are typically
three, women might wear separates, and men resort attire. The
revision, the cruise line explained, is in response to ``a national
trend toward a more casual approach to attire for both business and
vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the age of elegance has ebbed, on the high seas
as elsewhere. The great majority of Americans who have been on a
cruise or intend to go on one have made it known they prefer
informality. So most cruise lines have responded by adding dining
options where neckties and dresses are not required and rarely
encountered.
</P>
<P>
   The Voyager of the Seas, for example, will have three main
dining rooms, each named for (and its decor patterned after) an
opera; three casual dining rooms (including a '50s-style Johnny
Rockets); an Italian restaurant; a patisserie, and a caviar bar.
The Carnival Triumph, which entered service in July, has two main
dining rooms plus a casual dining area with a New York-style deli,
Asian specialties and a 24-hour pizzeria _ plus a South Beach Club
bistro and a Vienna coffeehouse.
</P>
<P>
   There will always be some passengers even on megaships who will
continue to dress, and Cunard hopes to preserve a slice of elegance
with its advertising campaign that speaks of the time, as one ad
puts it, ``when gentlemen on Queen Mary dressed for dinner, and
passengers wore T-shirts  &UR; under &LR;  their clothing.''
</P>
<P>
   But for better or worse, the abundance and variety of discount
fares, the likelihood of attracting six million passengers and the
race to build new ships to sail to more and distant ports are
intimately bound up in the ``more casual approach to attire'' that
even Silversea Cruises, one of the handful of luxury lines, has
found irresistible.

RICHARDSON NOW SUPPORTS BILL THAT OVERHAULS ENERGY DEPT. 
</HEADLINE>
  (pr) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Reversing course, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson
says he will recommend that President Clinton sign a $289 billion
Pentagon budget bill that overhauls the Energy Department, creating
an agency within the department to oversee nuclear weapons
programs.
</P>
<P>
   For several weeks, Richardson has threatened to ask the
president to veto the bill, arguing that the move to revamp the
department in response to accusations that China had stolen nuclear
weapons information would undermine his authority.
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday, Richardson relented in the face of veto-proof
margins in both the House and Senate and the prospect of opposing a
popular bill that gave 1.4 million troops their largest raise in 18
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recognize the importance to the troops of the pay raise,
readiness and retirement legislation,'' Richardson said Monday
through a spokeswoman, echoing comments he made on Sunday that he
would try to redress the parts of the reorganization he found
confusing.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said Monday that Clinton would sign the
bill within the next several days.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would create an agency, the National Nuclear Security
Administration, with some autonomy within the Energy Department.
The agency's director, an under secretary of Energy, would have
broad authority over policy, budgeting and counterintelligence for
nuclear programs. The director would report to the Secretary of
Energy.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson and some Democrats in the Senate had argued that an
agreement hammered out last month between House and Senate
negotiators would blur the lines of authority between Richardson
and the new agency.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the National Association of Attorneys General wrote
Clinton to express concern that provisions of the bill would weaken
existing oversight of the Energy Department's environmental, safety
and health operations.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Richardson's lobbying, lawmakers brushed aside his
concerns. The House earlier this month approved the agreement,
called a conference report, by a vote of 375-45. The Senate
followed last week, by a vote of 93-5. Both margins were much
larger than the two-thirds majority needed to override a
Presidential veto.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, many legislators and their aides said it was
politically impossible to oppose a raise for the military at a time
when the armed services were having trouble recruiting and
retaining top-quality troops.
</P>
<P>
   In an illustration of how officials in Washington have tried to
put the best face on a bureaucratic defeat, Richardson and
Democratic critics have changed their tune, saying that provisions
they once called untenable are now tolerable.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., voted against the conference report
but voted for the overall bill last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``A strong Secretary of Energy may be able to overcome these
difficulties and address the Department's problems in an effective
manner,'' Levin said.

<P>
   RIMINI, Italy _ A two-year criminal investigation in Italy has
turned up evidence that alleged Russian organized-crime operators
have funneled millions of dollars through the Bank of New York in
what Italian prosecutors called a money-laundering scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Through an examination of bank records and telephone wiretaps,
investigators in this seaside town in northeastern Italy say they
have uncovered the first concrete examples of illicit funds moving
through a group of accounts at the Bank of New York that are under
investigation by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors here say criminal gangs were raising money in
Italy through a mixture of legitimate business activities as well
as extortion and tax fraud. The funds, investigators suspect, were
regularly routed to Moscow and New York, where, bank records show,
they were transferred to Italian bank accounts belonging to
suspected organized-crime operators.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must be assumed that part of large sums of money that have
been transferred into Italian bank accounts are the proceeds from
protection racketeering with regard to Russian businessmen,'' said
Daniele Barberini, an investigating magistrate here, in an arrest
order issued in February for the leader of the reputed Russian
crime gang.
</P>
<P>
   The case appears to involve small-time racketeers who allegedly
demanded payments from Russian traders in Italy who exported
consumer goods to Russia. Those payoffs, investigators believe,
went to the Bank of New York, passing through accounts of Benex
Corp. and winding up in Italian bank accounts belonging to
suspected organized-crime operators.
</P>
<P>
   Benex and a group of related accounts at the New York bank are
at the center of a federal money-laundering investigation. The
Benex network of accounts was the pipeline through which at least
$7.5 billion moved from Russia into the Bank of New York in the
last three years, according to the bank.
</P>
<P>
   So far there have been two arrests in Italy and international
arrest warrants have been issued for 10 more people.
</P>
<P>
   The examination uncovered three accounts in which money flowed
through the Bank of New York to bank accounts in Italy. In one
case, $5.5 million went from Benex to the Italian bank account of
Boris Rizner. Rizner, 34, is a Ukrainian and a reputed member of a
local gang for whom an arrest warrant for racketeering has been
issued in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   In another instance, Vladimir Zabolotsky, another alleged Moscow
gang member, had a bank account in Italy that received money from
the Benex and Torfinex Corp. accounts at the Bank of New York. An
international arrest warrant has been issued for him.
</P>
<P>
   Neither man could be reached for comment. The Bank of New York,
which is cooperating with the U.S. authorities, said it would have
no comment on the transactions.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation here was triggered in October 1997, when a
Russian businessman, Pavel Markovitsev, complained to the Italian
police of harassment by Russian and Ukrainian racketeers in Moscow
and in Italy, Barberini said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Markovitsev's testimony to the Italian investigators led to the
arrest in February of Yossif Roizis, a 52-year old native of
Ukraine and a naturalized U.S. citizen, who is considered by the
Italian officials to be the head of a crime gang operating in this
part of northeast Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Roizis faces trial on extortion, kidnapping and racketeering
charges. He could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The proceeds in this extortion racket, investigators said, were
considerable, but they could not specify an exact amount. Its
activities appear to have continued from the early 1990s until
1998, when it was effectively broken by the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Markovitsev was one of thousands of small-time businessmen who
began landing in towns around Rimini on Italy's eastern Adriatic
Sea coast for a mix of beach and business after the collapse of the
old Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   These small-time traders, armed with bundles of cash ranging
from several hundred dollars to $70,000, bought Italian consumer
goods with the intention of sending them back to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The region around Rimini is dotted with small family-run
companies that produce a range of goods, including apparel items
like shoes and hosiery, but also home furnishings and furniture.
The companies supply their products to big European name brands but
also sell goods under their own label through private channels.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the suppliers were known to the Russians from business
deals during the final years of the Soviet Union. And their
reputation for high quality at attractive prices lured Russian
importers here as demand for Western goods soared in the early
'90s.
</P>
<P>
   At its peak in the mid-1990s, Italian officials said, some
60,000 to 70,000 Russians were arriving at Rimini's tiny airport
each year. Today the international arrivals gate is marked in
Italian and Russian. Posters around the airport advertise, in
Russian, companies offering services for Russian businessmen
looking for Italian wholesalers. On the tarmac, Russian-built
Antonov cargo planes are often seen loading goods headed for
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   According to investigators, Roizis had grown powerful in the
Rimini area organizing the export of Italian consumer goods. His
legitimate businesses included trading in these goods, but he and
his associates boosted their income by offering to introduce
Russian traders to Italian manufacturers _ for a commission.
</P>
<P>
   Russians who refused to go along, like Markovitsev, soon found
themselves subjected to beatings and the tires of their cars were
slashed. Some were taken to local hotels, held for hours and
subjected to threats, a practice that qualifies under Italian law
as kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Another money-making ploy was to demand that the Russian
businessmen hand over the invoices for the Italian goods they
bought. Armed with these, the racketeers went to Italian tax
authorities and wangled reimbursement for the value-added tax that
the Russian businessmen had paid on the goods. Such levies are
routinely reimbursed to exporters who can prove the products were
not sold in Italy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Italian prosecutors have focused on twelve gang members,
thanks to telephone taps that were made possible by information
provided by Markovitsev.
</P>
<P>
   But before the arrests were ordered, investigators had set about
reviewing the bank accounts of the suspected mobsters.
</P>
<P>
   Barberini said that records of bank transactions between April
1997 and May 1998, brought to light numerous smaller transactions
that came out of the Bank of New York to Italy and that totaled
about $5.5 million. That included a series of transactions in which
about $700,000 was paid into an account at a local bank, the
Credito Cooperativo Ospedaletto, belonging to Rizner, an associate
of Roizis, the reputed gang leader who is under arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian investigators have been unable to trace the movement
of the money back beyond the Bank of New York, though Barberini
said he hoped the FBI would be able to help find out how the money
got to the bank and where it originated.
</P>
<P>
   His suspicion is that the proceeds from both the gang's
legitimate activities and its illegal ones were regularly
transferred to Moscow, from where it was laundered by passing
through the Benex accounts at the Bank of New York and returned to
the gang in Rimini. There the money was then used to buy fresh
Italian goods for sale in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In other transactions through the Bank of New York, over $1
million went into an account at a local branch of the Banco di Roma
in the name of Zabolotsky, another gang member, in the same period
of 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The money was traced back through the Bank of New York to
several companies in the United States, Barberini said, though the
largest amounts came from Benex and two related companies, Torfinex
Corp. of New York, and BECS International LLC, a New Jersey
corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Berlin, a Russian-born businessman, is suspected of having
opened at least one account at the Bank of New York on behalf of
Torfinex, a money-transferring firm that shared offices with Benex
in New York. Berlin is married to Lucy Edwards, a Bank of New York
vice president who has been fired since the the federal
investigation surfaced last month.
</P>
<P>
   BECS has been known to the FBI since 1998, when Russian
investigators asked it for help in tracing a $300,000 ransom
payment made to racketeers in Moscow for the release of a Russian
kidnapping victim.
</P>
<P>
   Italian investigators are continuing their inquiry and are now
looking into whether the Rimini gang's sources of income extend to
other illegal activities, like prostitution or trafficking in drugs
or arms.
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, the history of the gang leader, Roizis, gives them
reason to believe there may be more to discover.
</P>
<P>
   As early as the 1980s Roizis had been detained in Italy on
suspicion of drug trafficking between Italy and the United States,
but he was released on bail by the Italians.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1995, in a raid that Italian investigators made on
Roizis' home in Fano, a resort south of Rimini, police seized
Roizis together with Monya Elson, the reputed head of a Russian
emigre crime gang in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Elson had earlier fled to Italy to hide out with Roizis after
narrowly surviving several unsuccessful attacks on his life,
including a 1993 shooting attack in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Elson, who is believed by the FBI to have close ties to another
Russian gangland figure, Semyon Mogilevich, was indicted in New
York on charges of masterminding a five-year reign of violence in
the United States that included at least three gangland murders
related to drug trafficking, racketeering and extortion. In an
interview in May with the Village Voice, Elson called himself a
``partner'' of Mogilevich.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian police arrested Roizis and Elson on charges of money
laundering and smuggling jewelry in and out of Italy, but later
extradited Elson to the United States, where he is being held
pending trial on the racketeering and murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   Roizis faces trial in Italy, on charges of money laundering and
smuggling. He may also stand trial separately for racketeering,
extortion, threats, and kidnapping of Russian businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   Barberini, the investigating magistrate, said Roizis had
occasionally cooperated with Italian investigators. Two years ago
he supplied information that led to the arrest of 13 Russian
mobsters operating in Italy, including Yuri Essin, a reputed
Russian gang leader, and an Italian businessman who was a former
executive of the large Italian oil company Eni, on charges of
racketeering and money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   But the Russians, including Essin, and the Italian executive
were acquitted when the wiretap evidence on which the case rested
was declared inadmissible.

</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Oct. 3)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   To sense the delight of a cruise on the Skorpios III along the
southern coast of Chile, imagine this scene the day we returned to
the ship for lunch after a morning spent gazing in awed silence at
the sapphire beauty of a mile-wide glacier. As some of us competed
to find the right superlatives to describe the experience, the
Colombian priest on my right raised his wine glass and toasted the
captain, Constantino Kochifas, at the other end of the table with
the words: ``Captain, you have brought us to the gates of Heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Cutting through the waters surrounding the natural ice
sculptures in front of San Rafael Glacier at almost 47 degrees
south latitude was the high point of the six-day cruise, but every
day in the fjords, lakes and gulfs seemed made for postcards, right
up to the 10 p.m. sunsets we watched through the dining room
windows as we ate. The trip was half adventure and half lazy
pleasure, a few parts funky and a few parts luxury.
</P>
<P>
   I had traveled and lived in Chile, and had long dreamed of
taking a trip on one of the vessels of the family-run Skorpios
line. It was a special thrill to fly out of the Midwest on a
January afternoon with snow in the forecast and land 12{ hours
later in Santiago, the capital, at the height of summer.
</P>
<P>
   From Santiago, I flew almost 600 miles farther south to Puerto
Montt, the main port in the Chilean lake region, to board the
Skorpios III, a bright orange and white vessel with three sun
decks. Dinner was nearly over that Friday night when I arrived from
the airport, and a waiter put me at a table alone, but Mimi de
Kochifas, the captain's wife, walked over and set the easy,
gracious tone that was to mark the cruise. She said that because I
spoke Spanish she would to put me at her husband's table starting
at breakfast the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   I was pleased with the comfort of my twin-bed cabin. At 195
square feet, it felt roomy, and the porthole was a real window, a
good three feet wide. I was on the Acropolis Deck, the second of
five levels. Fine paneling, made from the beautiful woods for which
the south of Chile is known, went halfway up the walls. The bath
was small, sleek and modern, with a walk-in shower and an adequate
vanity. There was an ample closet, a mini-safe, two chairs and a
small table, television and internal telephone.
</P>
<P>
   The Skorpios III is the newest of the line's three passenger
vessels. Built in 1995, the 1,210-ton ship is 230 feet long and can
carry 125 passengers and a crew of 34. Its sister ship, Skorpios
II, built in 1988 with similar dimensions and room for 35 more
passengers, made the same cruise on the same schedule, usually
dropping anchor at ports just before or after we did.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, after a late breakfast, we sailed south out of
Puerto Montt, lounging on the sun decks and waving goodbye to the
snow-topped volcano in the distance. The waiters brought us festive
aperitifs, including pisco sours, the Chilean national cocktail,
made of a strong grape-based liquour, lemon juice, powdered sugar
and egg white. Our voyage was taking us to the San Rafael Glacier
and back, a distance of about 400 nautical miles each way. We would
be sailing through interior coastal waters, among the hundreds of
islands, islets and peninsulas that make up the far south of Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Chile's weather, terrain and flora have much in common with the
West Coast of the United States and Canada _ but with the seasons
in reverse. It is a skinny country that stretches for nearly 3,000
miles along the west side of South America. The desert is in the
far north, the central region has a temperate climate, and the
south is similar to the Pacific Northwest _ a green and often rainy
area with vast forests and good fishing.
</P>
<P>
   We spent all of the first day sailing, passing through the
Llanquihue Archipelago, the Gulf of Ancud and the Gulf of
Corcovado. The scenery was a blend of tranquil farm scenes, an
occasional fishing village and, in the distance, the lower Andes,
dwindling down to a mere 7,000 to 8,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   At lunch, as the waiters generously poured fine Chilean wines,
we all introduced ourselves and learned that we came from 14
countries. Argentines and Brazilians were the most numerous,
followed by Chileans. Others came from elsewhere in Latin America.
A few came from Europe and Japan, a family of three from Australia;
I was the only passenger from the United States. Several children
were aboard, ranging in age from 7 or 8 to the early teens. An
English-speaking interpreter helped those who didn't speak Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Kochifas told us his family's story. His father immigrated to
Chile from Greece and eventually settled in Puerto Montt and set up
a tailoring business. The sons, growing up surrounded by water and
fishing boats, learned to sail. Starting from scratch, the captain
first built and ran a series of small cargo ships, then some 20
years ago built his first passenger vessel and began to bring
passengers to the island-studded seas and secret fjords. His older
brother, Demostenes, was the second pilot on our ship. A son was
the pilot of the Skorpios II. Other Kochifases were working behind
the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   The captain promised us a cocktail called a 12 and 30 once we
reached the glacier. The ingredients: 12-year-old Scotch over
30,000-year-old ice _ the estimated age of the glacier. All of the
ice we consumed on the ship came from the huge chunks that
continually broke from the glacier and slipped into the surrounding
lagoon. The glacier and lagoon are in a national park whose unique
biosphere is recognized by Unesco; the ice is formed from snow
falling on a peak seldom visited by humans.
</P>
<P>
   We quickly settled into a pleasant routine of four meals a day _
breakfast, lunch, tea and dinner, plus morning and evening
aperitifs with nuts and chips in the Apollo and Zeus bars. The
menus ranged from haute cuisine to sturdy Chilean peasant fare, and
it was all very good. Salmon, which is farmed along the coast in
the area, was a staple along with other local fish including sea
bass, and there were heaping platters of shellfish hauled aboard
mid-voyage from small fishing boats. One night, the Chilean college
student on my left put away almost six dozen oysters on the half
shell. We also had steak and chicken, and the kitchen staff
accommodated special requests made a few hours ahead.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The weather was ideal. It felt much warmer under the midsummer
sun and cloudless skies than the projected 54 to 72 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   On our third day out, however, I awoke and looked out the window
to something awesomely different. The glacier was rising out of the
surrounding gray mist as a steady rain beat down on the ship and
the waters of the lagoon. The mass of ice glistened white and
crystal blue. Two small ice cutters had been lowered from the ship
and were waiting to carry us closer to the glacier. The rain was
going to make our excursion rather cold and uncomfortable, but it
lent drama to the day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I put on layer upon layer of clothing; as we stepped onto the
ice cutters, the crew handed out life jackets.
</P>
<P>
   Approaching the glacier, we first noticed floating around us the
huge chunks of ice, pieces that had broken off as if an artist had
been wielding a chisel, creating free-form sculptures in strikingly
varied shades of blue, gray, green and stark white.
</P>
<P>
   San Rafael Glacier, the centerpiece of a national park of the
same name, is part of an ice field created by ice and snow tumbling
down Mount San Valentin, which towers 13,300 feet above the lagoon.
The captain told us that the glacier was first seen by Europeans
some 400 years ago and that, at the rate it was crumbling, would be
gone in 200 years. The ice field extends well inland from the
lagoon into an area virtually inaccessible except by foot across
rugged terrain. On maps of the region, the ice appears to cover
about 60 miles north-south and roughly half that east-west. What we
saw was a section an estimated 7,300 feet wide that forms an icy
path between mountain peaks, rising to a height of 230 feet above
the water and reaching a depth of more than 750 feet into the
lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   As promised, while we circled before the glacier, crew members
jumped up onto one of the chunks of ice and chipped off enough to
fill several ice buckets, then brought out fine glassware and
poured everybody a hefty amount of Scotch over those crystal-clear
rocks. They opened a hamper filled with small sandwiches and
followed with hot coffee. With the food and drink gone _ along with
most of our film _ we began to feel the chill and were more than
ready to return to the comfort of the Skorpios III.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, as a whisper of sun began to peek through the
clouds, Demostenes Kochifas guided the ship closer to the wall of
ice, and some of us crowded around him on the bridge to watch as,
every few minutes, a piece would split from the front of the
glacier and cascade into the lagoon. Those of us with cameras tried
capturing the moment when the ice splashed into the water.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 p.m., we turned our backs on the glacier and sailed back
north toward sunny skies and warmer weather.
</P>
<P>
   We reached Quitralco Fjord, jutting deep into another national
park, this one covered with forests and fields of wildflowers. We
dropped anchor at a dock beside a dining hall and thermal baths
that the cruise line operates on the edge of the wilderness, and
some passengers went ashore for a quick dip in the 90-degree
waters.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, we raced in small boats through the fingers of
water branching off from the main fjord, then returned for what
Latin Americans call a parrillada _ a mixed-grill feast. We began
with the tasty meat pies, empanadas, followed by steak, sausages,
potatoes, salad and the usual good wines. On the wall behind our
table were models of the nearly dozen boats and ships the captain
had built, from his first tiny cargo vessel. There were also old
family photos and a big one of the captain and Gabriel Garcia
Marquez, the Nobel Laureate in literature, together at the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   From Quitralco, our ship continued lazily north, through
countryside that had the look of Switzerland _ black and white
cattle grazed in neat pastures on rolling hillsides, framed by vast
stands of trees. We were back to basking in the sun in our bathing
suits. On the west lay the large island Chiloe, some 125 miles long
and one of the places identified with Darwin's voyage to the area
on the Beagle in the 1830s.
</P>
<P>
   Our last stop before returning to port was Castro, Chiloe's
principal town and a significant fishing and artisan center. It
also marked our return to the money economy. The night I boarded, I
simply stashed my money in the mini-safe, and then enjoyed the
unusual sensation of not having to spend any for the next five
days. But now, it took cash to satisfy my urge to buy the hand-knit
woolen cloche hat I found in the handicrafts market for $4. And
then $30 more to buy a hand-woven woolen jacket. But the true
souvenir of the trip was that first sight of the glacier _ fixed in
my mind, as a glimpse of what Heaven should be.
</P>
<P>
   Booking a trip on Skorpios III
</P>
<P>
   Getting There
</P>
<P>
   I flew American Airlines nonstop from Dallas to Santiago, then
bought a round-trip ticket on Ladeco, a Chilean airline, to Puerto
Montt, about 600 miles to the south. There is a flight every few
hours on Ladeco or LAN Chile. By waiting until I got to Santiago to
buy the ticket, I paid $250, while the price to buy it in advance
in the United States was $376.
</P>
<P>
   Contacting the Line
</P>
<P>
   The Skorpios III and her sister vessels, Skorpios I and II, sail
between Puerto Montt and the San Rafael Glacier in the far south of
Chile from September through May _ which covers the Southern
Hemisphere's spring, summer and fall. For the 1999-2000 season, the
weekly cruises began Sept. 4 and continue through the week of May
27.
</P>
<P>
   Prices vary according to the month and the ship. High season
runs from mid-December through mid-March, which is the Chilean
summer. Everything else is low season.
</P>
<P>
   On the Skorpios III, the newest of the three vessels, built in
1995, high season prices for a double cabin range from $3,400 to
$5,000 a cabin, with suites at $5,300 and $5,800 a cabin. Low
season prices range from $2,600 to $3,700 double and $3,850 and
$4,100 for suites.
</P>
<P>
   The Skorpios II, built in 1988, has prices ranging from $2,800
to $4,200 for double cabins in high season and from $2,100 to
$3,220 in low season. She also has three- and four-person cabins
with bunk beds, plus suites. The Skorpios I, built in 1978 and with
bunk beds in many of the cabins, has doubles ranging from $2,100 to
$3,240 a cabin in high season and $1,600 to $2,400 low season. It
also has three-person cabins and some junior suites.
</P>
<P>
   The prices cover everything on board _ four meals a day,
cocktails and wine _ and the mixed grill at the cruise line's
dining hall near Quitralco Fjord. I needed money during the cruise
for taxis at a couple of fishing villages where we stopped,
handicraft purchases and tips for the crew.
</P>
<P>
   Pleasant as the cruise is, making arrangements for it from
outside of Chile requires some tenacity. The cruise line has a Web
site at www.skorpios.cl, where I found useful information on the
schedule and itinerary, but when I used the e-mail address to ask
about availability of particular dates, I got no response, even
after a couple of proddings. Eventually, I called the cruise line's
agency in Santiago, (56-2) 231-1030, fax (56-2) 232-2269, and
quickly got answers and made a reservation. Telephone numbers for
the Skorpios headquarters in Puerto Montt are (56-65) 255050, fax
(56-65) 258315.
</P>
<P>
   I was asked to pay by direct transfer to a bank in Miami, for
which the agency in Santiago faxed me the necessary forms. But an
Australian traveler on my voyage said he was able to pay by credit
card at his hometown travel agency.

   WASHINGTON _ With four days left before the start of the new
fiscal year, Republican leaders in Congress formally conceded on
Monday that they would not meet the deadline for passing the annual
spending bills, and the White House laid down a new deadline, three
weeks away.
</P>
<P>
   That set in motion a $500 billion confrontation between Congress
and the Clinton administration, which has vowed to veto half of the
Republicans' spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   The White House is sitting back and watching Congress fail to
complete its appropriations work before the fiscal year ends at
midnight on Thursday, hoping and expecting that when negotiations
over spending begin next month, President Clinton will once again
outmaneuver the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The president appeared to step up the pressure on the
Republicans on Monday when he announced that the surplus for the
1999 fiscal year ending Thursday will be a record $115 billion. The
surplus, which had been projected at $99 billion, grew because of a
surge in tax revenues, Clinton said in a Rose Garden statement
before departing for New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   October will be a month of ``pretty contentious'' arguments
between the White House and Congress over the way the government
will spend more than half a trillion dollars, predicted Jack Lew,
the White House budget director.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you that we're not going to be facing
brinksmanship,'' Lew said.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, in a previous bout over spending bills, Clinton
won almost every round. The Republicans were bruised, and Congress
wound up lashing together a 4,000-page omnibus spending bill
replete with billions for pet projects. Almost no member of
Congress read that bill before it was passed.
</P>
<P>
   The fight, members say, was not ennobling, and few Republicans
are looking forward to a rematch.
</P>
<P>
   The result was even worse for them in 1995. When the White House
and the newly elected Republican Congress failed to strike a deal
then, much of the government shut down. Voters blamed Congress for
the closing of national parks and Washington's museums and the
snarling of federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the next fiscal year rapidly approaching, Congress has
yet to complete work on 9 of the 13 spending bills needed to
finance government agencies. Further, Clinton and his senior
advisers say he will veto seven of the bills if Congress passes
them in their current form.
</P>
<P>
   So, in the absence of an organizational miracle this week to
speed final congressional passage of the outstanding bills, and
unless the president changes his mind about the vetoes, the new
fiscal year will start with 10 of the 13 spending bills either
incomplete or unsigned.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, formally acknowledging that they could not complete
their work on time, Republican leaders in Congress began preparing
a ``continuing resolution,'' a stopgap bill that will finance
government agencies at the current year's spending levels for three
weeks, until Oct. 21.
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials struck an impatient posture on
Monday, calling for a two-week continuing resolution, and implying
that Congress should hurry up and get to the bargaining table.

 OSEOLA McCARTY, 91, WASHERWOMAN WITH A HEART OF GOLD  
(ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers

<P>
   HATTIESBURG, Miss. _ She had not even known exactly what the
word philanthropy meant, but the elderly washerwoman who gave away
practically every dollar she ever made to endow a scholarship fund
for poor students in Mississippi would become a symbol of selfless
giving.
</P>
<P>
   Oseola McCarty, who gave away a life savings of $150,000 to help
complete strangers get a college education at the University of
Southern Mississippi here in her hometown, died late Sunday
afternoon in the little frame house where she took in laundry and
ironing and made her small fortune a dollar or two at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Miss McCarty was told that she had liver cancer three weeks ago,
about a year after she underwent surgery for colon cancer. She
wanted her last days to be spent in the little house where she
spent most of her life. She was 91.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to close my eyes because I don't know if I'll
open them again,'' the tiny, frail woman told a visitor recently.
``But I am not afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of her death, she decided in the summer of 1995
to give away most of her life savings, saying that there was
nothing in particular she wanted to buy and no place in particular
she wanted to go. An only child who had outlived her relatives, she
lived a solitary existence, surrounded by rows of clothes she made
pretty for people who knew her only as the washerwoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm giving it away so that the children won't have to work so
hard, like I did,'' she said in July 1995.
</P>
<P>
   She did not want any monuments, any proclamations, said people
that knew her. But the selflessness of her gift would bring her
worldwide attention. The woman who had gone out only for some
preaching at the Friendship Baptist Church in Hattiesburg and to
buy groceries would be honored by the United Nations, would shake
hands with President Clinton and would receive more than 300
awards. People all over the world knew who she was and what she
did.
</P>
<P>
   The woman who acted in anticipation of death found a life she
could have never imagined. She flew on a plane for the first time
in her life and laughed out loud when the food did not fall off the
tray as the plane rumbled through the sky. She stayed in a hotel
for the first time in her life, and before she checked out, she
made the bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``People treated her like a monument,'' said Jewel Tucker, the
secretary to the president of the university and Miss McCarty's
traveling companion in those almost giddy years after the gift.
``But she was really a movement. It will keep moving.''
</P>
<P>
   Contributions from more than 600 donors have added some $330,000
to the original scholarship fund of $150,000. After hearing of Miss
McCarty's gift, Ted Turner, a multibillionaire, gave away a billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `If that little woman can give away everything she
has, then I can give a billion,''' Ms. Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone can say they felt adoration in their life, Ms. Tucker
said, Miss McCarty could. People would see her in airports and
flock to her. Some people just wanted to touch her, as though she
was good luck.
</P>
<P>
   Along with all the plaques and trophies or other honors _ she
received the Presidential Citizen's Medal, the nation's second
highest civilian award, and an honorary doctorate from Harvard
University _ she was awarded other things that were pure fun.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, she carried the Olympic torch through part of
Mississippi. Later that year, hers was the hand on the switch that
dropped the ball in Times Square in New York's wild New Year's Eve
celebration. In fact, she said at the time, it was the first time
she had actually stayed up past midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Miss McCarty will lie in state in the rotunda of the
university's main building on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Friends like Aubrey K. Lucas, president emeritus of the
University of Southern Mississippi, said it warmed him and others
that came into contact with her to know that a lifetime of
loneliness had been pushed aside by all the positive attention that
her gift brought.
</P>
<P>
   Horace Fleming, the university's president, said he sometimes
wondered if all the attention that came her way was really welcome.
But he believes now that it was.
</P>
<P>
   Her traveling companion, Ms. Tucker, knows that Miss McCarty did
enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   Although she never asked for it, ``She loved every minute of
it,'' Ms. Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   In time, people came to see her almost like an oracle and
listened closely for pearls of wisdom at the little woman's knee.
</P>
<P>
   But her friends know that Miss McCarty's wisdom was really a mix
of common decency and common sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of talk about self-esteem these days,'' she once
said. ``It seems pretty basic to me. If you want to feel proud of
yourself, you've got to do things you can be proud of. Feelings
follow actions.''
</P>
<P>
   The university's president said that a New York reporter once
asked him out of earshot of Miss McCarty to tell him the true story
of her gift.
</P>
<P>
   ``How did it really happen?'' the reporter asked him.
</P>
<P>
   The president told the reporter that it happened just as Miss
McCarty said, that she had wanted to do something good with the
money she had made. It is not any more complicated than that,
Fleming said.
</P>
<P>
   In a world in which people are suspicious of things too good to
be true, he said, Miss McCarty really was good and true.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The central banks of Europe, which own nearly half of the gold
held by governments and institutions, have begun a rescue mission
for gold, which slid to a 20-year low earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   By agreeing on Sunday to limit the annual sales of their
reserves, the banks eased fears that they would flood the market.
Now that they have taken this OPEC-like step to support prices, it
may be hard to explain why they did not do so earlier. Since 1996,
when fears of massive selling by central banks really began to
drive down prices, gold has lost nearly 40 percent of its value.
And the banks' gold reserves plunged in value as well.
</P>
<P>
   Initially at least, the belated effort worked. The price of gold
soared $14 to end Monday at $281.90 an ounce on the New York
Commodity Exchange, after jumping as high as $288 an ounce. The
stocks of gold mining companies, in turn, got a big lift. Newmont
Mining jumped 21 percent and Barrick Gold 16 percent, as both
companies hit new highs for the year and wiped out all their losses
since May.
</P>
<P>
   What the rescue effort means for the price of gold over the
longer term is hard to know since the details of the banks'
agreement were not announced. In addition, buyers may thin out in
response to a big spike in gold's price. Many analysts expect that
to happen around the relative stratosphere of $300 an ounce.
</P>
<P>
   Further increases will depend on how the agreement is carried
out, what other central banks do, and whether the limits on gold
lending in the agreement discourage speculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The devil is in the details,'' said Peter Beaumont, head of
precious metals at Warbug Dillon Read. ``The impact is not clear
and forecastable.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the announcement by 15 central banks was a victory for
gold producers. The producers also won a round with the
International Monetary Fund, which announced over the weekend that
it would not sell a big portion of its reserves on the open market
to raise money to help the world's poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
   The producers had lobbied to block the IMF gold sale and for an
orderly process for gold sales by central banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a coordinated effort to control the flow of central bank
gold to the market, and you wouldn't want to underestimate how
powerful that could be,'' Beaumont said. ``This is a very
significant change.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, the price of gold has fallen on the threat of yet
another central bank announcing it will or has sold millions of
ounces of gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has not been the central bank sales that have been the
problem,'' said George Milling-Stanley, the manager of gold market
analysis at the World Gold Council, which represents the world's
major gold producers. ``It has been the perception of central bank
sales coming down the pike that has been a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1989, central banks have sold 2,053 tons of gold, equal to
half of last year's total supply, which includes mine production,
scrap recycling and central bank sales, according to Gold Fields
Mineral Services, a London-based precious metals research firm. The
effective coup de grace came in May, when the Bank of England
announced that it would sell 415 tons of gold over several years.
The price of gold plunged nearly $7 on that day.
</P>
<P>
   According to the agreement, which was announced Sunday night
during the semi-annual meeting of the IMF and the World Bank in
Washington, the 15 central banks have agreed to limit their annual
sales to 400 tons of gold, or 10 percent of the total supply, for
five years. That amounts to a little more than the 315-ton annual
average over the last 10 years of net sales _ sales minus purchases
_ by all governments and their institutions, like the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the 2,000 tons in sales outlined for the next five
years includes the 1,300 tons the Swiss plan to sell and the 365
tons the Bank of England still has to dispose of to complete its
announced program. So very little more can be sold by the other
banks, including the European Central Bank, which represents the 11
nations joined in the euro currency, the Swiss National Bank and
the Bank of England.
</P>
<P>
   The central banks also said they would limit their lending of
gold to current levels. Speculators, who want to sell borrowed gold
and profit on its decline by buying gold back at lower levels, and
gold producers, who want to lock in prices by hedging, need to
borrow gold. Transactions by both groups have put significant
downward pressure on gold.
</P>
<P>
   Wim Duisenberg, the president of the European Central Bank,
acknowledged that the rescue effort was self-serving. Referring to
the 16,200 tons held by the group of central banks, he said the
agreement was aimed at ``keeping the value of that gold where it
is.'' He also said ``the purpose of this action is to give
certainty to the gold market.''
</P>
<P>
   The question now is how much higher can the price of gold go.
The answer will depend on how other central banks, speculators and
producers respond to this initiative.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Philip Klapwijk, managing director of Gold Fields Mineral
Services, said that Gold Fields' price forecast of $240 to $270 an
ounce ``has already been punctured.'' But he also said that if
investor uncertainty over central bank gold sales was ``the only
thing holding back the market, the price would have risen more
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia, Venezuela and other major gold owners not part of the
agreement could disrupt the market if they decide to sell now.
Kevin Crisp, vice president and precious metals strategist at J.P.
Morgan in London, said: ``Admittedly, there are plenty of central
banks that weren't part of the announcement. One wonders what they
will do.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Sokalsky, the chief financial officer of Barrick Gold
Corp., a major producer and hedger of gold, said he expected that
many of the hedge funds and speculators who had sold gold to profit
on its decline have reversed their bets buy buying back gold and
may be on the sidelines for a while.
</P>
<P>
   The five percent jump in the price of gold last week, he said,
seemed to be powered, in part, by this reversal of speculators'
positions to protect their profits or limit their losses. The rally
was set off by strong demand at the Bank of England's sale of 25
tons of gold last Tuesday, the bank's second sale since May. If the
speculators have largely left the market, much of the punch has
already been felt.
</P>
<P>
   But Sokalsky said the lending limit would not hinder gold
producers who want to hedge. ``There is not going to be a squeeze
as a result of this announcement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a word of warning from Lawrence Kudlow, chief
economist at Schroder &AMP; Co. and a longtime believer in gold,
especially as an inflation barometer. He says that gold is still
signaling that inflation is contained or moving lower. And that
leads him to calculate that a ``normal'' gold price is around $288
an ounce, not very far from where it is now.

ARIZONA'S SEN. JOHN MCCAIN FORMALLY ANNOUNCES CANDIDACY FOR
PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JAY ROOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arizona Sen. John McCain, a political maverick who spent five
years as a Vietnam war prisoner, formally launched his bid for the
White House on Monday with a rebuke of pork-barrel spending, a call
for renewed patriotism and a vow to restore military greatness.
</P>
<P>
   An outspoken champion of campaign finance reform, the Republican
lawmaker said removing the corrupting influence of special interest
money from politics is the linchpin of virtually every important
government reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must eliminate the special-interest loopholes and
pork-barrel spending that are the result of a campaign financing
system that is nothing more than a sophisticated influence-peddling
scheme,'' McCain said at a rally in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Giving the broad outlines of his presidential agenda, McCain
said he would push for middle class tax cuts by expanding the
lowest income tax rate of 15 percent to couples earning up to
$70,000.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he'd push for vouchers allowing parents to send
their children to private school at taxpayer expense, and vowed to
return 90 percent of federal education dollars to local communities
instead of ``wasting it on Washington bureaucrats.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he would pay for his programs by using a projected
surplus and by cutting fat. He promised never to touch a dime of
the Social Security trust fund to offset government spending, ``no
ifs, ands or buts.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain began running for president months ago but waited until
Monday to formally announce his campaign for the GOP nomination. It
is likely to be an uphill battle.
</P>
<P>
   He has raised an estimated $10 million, respectable under the
old rules but only about a fifth of what record-setting fund raiser
George W. Bush has pulled in.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor is also far ahead of McCain and his other
Republican rivals in opinion polls. In New Hampshire, the
first-test primary where McCain has concentrated his resources,
Bush is beating McCain 45 percent to 12 percent, according to a new
University of New Hampshire poll.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted by the odds, McCain said he is running for president
to help ``reinvigorate our sense of national purpose'' and restore
America's standing in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the world's only superpower,'' he said. ``We must
accept the responsibilities along with the blessing that comes with
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Along those lines, McCain blasted President Clinton, saying he
has failed as commander-in-chief by ``weakening our defenses.'' But
he also blamed ``both parties in Congress'' for wasting money on
unneeded weapons systems while thousands of rank-and-file soldiers
subsist on food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a disgrace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The son and grandson of admirals, McCain drew upon his own war
and military experiences as he issued a ``new patriotic challenge''
to fight cynicism and return to the ``noble cause of freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   A Navy pilot shot down over Vietnam in 1967, McCain was a
prisoner of war for more than five years. Released in 1973, he
counts the Silver Star, Purple Heart and Distinguished Flying Cross
among his military honors.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year Navy veteran was elected to the House of
Representatives in 1982 and has been a senator since 1987. In 1992,
the Senate investigated McCain and four other senators for their
ties to savings and loan executive Charles Keating.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was cleared of any wrongdoing, but says the episode still
embarrasses him.
</P>
<P>
   Bucking his own party's leaders, McCain went on to lead the
fight for campaign finance reform, an effort that has not endeared
him to many of his colleagues in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he warned he would punish any member of Congress who
overrides his veto in order to ``waste your money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll make sure you know who they are,'' he said to raucous
applause. ``Every single one of them.''

TALKS OVER CONTROVERSIAL ART EXHIBIT BREAK DOWN AT CITY HALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In negotiations with senior City Hall officials on
Monday, the chairman of the Brooklyn Museum of Art discussed
various ways to end a dispute with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani over a
controversial art exhibition _ including the possibility of
removing a dung-stained portrait of the Virgin Mary _ but the talks
quickly fell apart after City Hall officials spread word of the
proposals to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever I discussed is now off the table,'' Robert S. Rubin,
chairman of the museum's board of trustees, said on Monday night,
clearly upset that word of his negotiations had been made public
before he had discussed them with other top museum officials.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday afternoon, City Hall officials told reporters that
Rubin had tentatively offered _ subject to approval from the
museum's board _ a package of concessions aimed at overcoming
Giuliani's objections to the exhibition, and at ensuring continued
public funding to the museum.
</P>
<P>
   The package, city officials said, included removing the Virgin
Mary painting by artist Chris Ofili, segregating five or six other
controversial works from the rest of the exhibition, and accepting
a 20 percent reduction in the city's subsidy to the museum during
the length of the show, which is scheduled to start on Saturday and
run through Jan. 9. The 20 percent reduction corresponds to the
amount of floor space the museum is devoting to the exhibit, city
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It represents a major concession on the part of the Brooklyn
Museum, and a significant victory for Rudy Giuliani,'' said Joseph
J. Lhota, deputy mayor for operations, who did not attend the
meetings but described them to reporters. ``On the money issue, in
fact, if that's true, its important that taxpayer dollars will not
be spent on a painting which desecrates religion, plus other pieces
of art which glorify a child-murderer and the other stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin acknowledged discussing the three ideas with city
officials, but he vigorously disputed their characterization of the
talks, and he emphasized that he engaged in the negotiations on his
own initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am chairman of the museum, and I _ without authorization
from the board, or without discussion with the staff of the museum
_ did raise certain ideas, that if they were acceptable to the
city, I would attempt to get agreement of all the relevant
parties,'' he said. ``Several ideas were on the table without any
commitment on my part that they could be implemented.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said he had merely asked city officials to select one of
the three ideas as the basis for a possible compromise he would
then attempt to sell to his board. But the very fact that he was
discussing the removal or segregation of art works angered museum
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Lehman, the director of the museum, declined to comment
on Monday night, although several of his aides were stunned by word
of the negotiations and vehemently denied that the museum had
agreed to withdraw the Virgin Mary painting, which has been
condemned as blasphemous by several Catholic leaders in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not withdrawing any of the works in the exhibition,''
said Sally Williams, a spokeswoman for the museum. ``None of the
works are being withdrawn.''

COMMENTARY: `BALANCE OF HARDSHIPS'  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY LEWIS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Dickens gave us the classic picture of official
heartlessness: the government Circumlocution Office, burial ground
of hope in ``Little Dorrit.'' It would take his savage wit to tell,
properly, the story of Sherol Boles and the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Boles is a 33-year-old woman from Barbados. In 1996 she
married Michael Boles, an American who served 12 years in the U.S.
Marines. They have 2-year-old twins, born three months prematurely
weighing less than two pounds each; they were hospitalized for
months and are still under medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The INS has ruled that Mrs. Boles' marriage entitles her to
permanent residence here: a green card. But for reasons in the past
she is legally deportable, and the INS says she must be deported.
If she is, it may be as long as 10 years before she can enter the
United States again.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Boles wants to have her deportation case reopened, so
account can be taken of her now-established right to a green card
and her children's fragile health. If she is deported alone, her
husband could not possibly take care of the twins by himself. If
she takes them with her, the medical care they need may not be
available in Barbados.
</P>
<P>
   But the case cannot be reopened without the consent of INS
officials, and they refuse to give it. Why? INS lawyers explained
in a brief, ``She has not shown that she would suffer irreparable
injury or that the balance of hardships tilt in her favor.''
Dickens could not have put more unfeeling words in the mouth of one
of his fictional tormentors.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Boles is still in the United States because her lawyer,
Harvey Kaplan of Boston, sought and won a stay of deportation from
the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The INS is urging the court
to withdraw the stay.
</P>
<P>
   The past chapters of the story deepen its harshness. Mrs. Boles
came to the United States in 1990, to Boston. Some years later she
tried to obtain legal permanent residence by using the services of
one Joseph Chatelain, who called himself an ``immigration
adviser.'' By 1995 Mrs. Boles and others realized they had been
defrauded by Chatelain. She testified in full and agreed to be a
witness against him, but he fled and has not been found.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, on the basis of her own statements, an immigration
judge ordered her deported. He allowed her to depart voluntarily _
legally advantageous _ by April 1996 ``or any extensions as
granted'' by the INS Immigration officials in Boston, citing her
cooperation in the Chatelain case, extended the date successively
to March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime Mrs. Boles had married and moved to her
husband's home in Phoenix. In February 1997 Michael Boles filed an
I-130 petition to get his wife permanent residence. The petition
went to the INS Texas service center, covering Phoenix. It was then
transferred to a California center, and from there back to the
local INS office in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1998, with the petition still pending and the date for
voluntary departure just past, the INS office in Boston gave Mrs.
Boles a year's stay of deportation. A year later she had still
heard nothing about her green card. She asked an INS officer in
Phoenix for a further stay. Denying it, he said the delay on the
green card petition must mean that her marriage was fraudulent _ in
effect blaming her for the notorious inefficiency of the INS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on a careful review of the facts of this case,'' an
official wrote, ``there do not appear to be any unusual
humanitarian factors.''
</P>
<P>
   The petition for a green card was finally granted this past
June, more than two years after it was filed. So far it has not
helped Sherol Boles. If she is deported, she may come within
provisions of the harsh 1996 Immigration Act that would bar her
from this country for 5 or 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Tough as it is, the 1996 law gives the INS power to reopen this
case. But the service seems determined in its refusal. In its 1st
Circuit brief it argued that the court has no power to review its
decision, right or wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Why is the INS so adamant? It must want to establish the
principle that nobody _ not even a court _ can make it pay
attention to reason and humanity.

GREENSPAN URGES JAPAN TO WIDEN CAPITAL SOURCES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board chairman,
urged Japan on Monday to develop more vibrant stock and bond
markets, saying that the country's overreliance on its moribund
banking system had deepened its economic downturn and impeded its
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the annual meeting of the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund, Greenspan said countries like the
United States that had well-developed capital markets as well as
strong banking systems weathered global and domestic financial
crises far better than those that relied primarily on banks.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's remarks covered the experiences of a number of
countries, from Thailand _ whose economy was decimated by the
financial market turmoil that swept through Asia in 1997 and 1998
in part because of its reliance on banks for capital _ to Sweden,
which withstood an acute domestic banking crisis in the early 1990s
because companies there were able to raise money from other
sources.
</P>
<P>
   But the Fed chairman's message seemed aimed most directly at
Japan. It followed two days of meetings here in which finance
ministers and central bankers from the United States and Europe
again pressed their counterparts from Tokyo to do more to revive
the Japanese economy and clean up the huge overhang of bad loans
that has all but paralyzed the country's banking system.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said Japan was the ``archetype of virtually bank-only
financial intermediation.'' When the banking system got into
trouble, he said, the result was a deep and continuing credit
crunch that has crippled an economy that had been Asia's linchpin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese government has intervened in the economy and is
injecting funds in order to recapitalize the banking system,''
Greenspan said. ``While it has made some important efforts, it has
yet to make significant progress in diversifying the financial
system, which arguably could be a key element, although not the
only one, in promoting long-term recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan also reiterated another message that the United States
has delivered to little effect for years: that Tokyo will save
money in the long run if its stops dithering and acts more
forcefully to close failed or failing banks, sell foreclosed real
estate and other assets, and create a smaller but healthier banking
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speedy resolution is good, whereas delay can significantly
increase the fiscal and economic costs of a crisis,'' Greenspan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan did not address the current state of the U.S. economy
or provide any hints of whether the Fed will raise interest rates
when its policy-setting committee meets next week. Analysts say the
central bank is increasingly likely to hold rates steady and wait
for further evidence of whether the economy is slowing sufficiently
to avert any buildup in inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan also avoided any mention of the Japanese currency. The
rise of the yen against the dollar over the last several months
prompted the Japanese central bank to hint last weekend that it
might reverse course and increase the money supply to weaken the
currency, a step favored by the United States.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Greenspan, whose speech was titled ``Lessons from the Global
Crises,'' said that one reason the U.S. economy held up so well
last year was that as the bond market seized up in the aftermath of
Russia's debt default, the commercial banking system stepped up its
lending.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the process of credit creation able to continue, the
impact on the real economy of the capital-market turmoil was
blunted,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   But Fed officials are now increasingly worried that bank lending
standards in the United States have grown too lax. Laurence Meyer,
a Federal Reserve governor, told the Institute of International
Bankers in a speech Monday that while overall loan portfolios
remain sound, there has been a modest but troubling increase in
questionable lending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lenders are relying too much on the continuation of good
times,'' Meyer said. ``They're assuming a very optimistic view of
their borrowers' operating prospects and that their borrowers
always will have ready access to the financial markets. And
sometimes they're failing to subject loans to meaningful `stress
tests' that would, for instance, tell them if their borrower could
withstand an unexpected shock to operating revenue.''

 _ SF CHRON   Willing Your IRA to a Charity 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; Q: If I were to assign my individual retirement account to a
charity in my will, would that eliminate the requirement that I
must begin to withdraw funds from the IRA after I reach age 701/2?
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm afraid not. You must obey the tax laws that apply to your
IRA during your lifetime, no matter who eventually will inherit
your account, says Internal Revenue Service spokesman Jesse Weller.
</P>
<P>
   I assume, by the way, that you are referring to a traditional
IRA. With a Roth IRA, there is no withdrawal requirement no matter
how old you are.
</P>
<P>
   With a traditional IRA, you must begin withdrawing money no
later than April 1 of the year following the year in which you
reach age 701/2. The minimum size of your annual withdrawals will
be based on life-expectancy tables that you can obtain from the
IRS. The charity will get only whatever is left in your IRA after
you die.
</P>
<P>
   There have been proposals before Congress from time to time that
would change the withdrawal requirement to give charities more
money. But that's not the law yet.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Retirement Payout
</P>
<P>
   Q: My husband works for Chevron and will be taking early
retirement either in January or June. He will come away with a
$700,000 retirement fund, consisting entirely of Chevron stock. We
know that we ought to diversify our holdings when we roll over this
fund.
</P>
<P>
   A friend referred us to a financial planner from one of the big
financial-service firms who says she would charge us either a large
fee up front or a significant annual fee to manage our money.
Should we go this route? We are pretty clueless.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: It may be that this financial planner is an incredible
investment whiz, well worth whatever she charges. However, you
ought to ask her to state in writing exactly how well she has done
for her clients in each of the past several years. Also, ask her to
show how her performance compared with the principal investment
benchmarks.
</P>
<P>
   Because you don't say exactly how much she charges and because I
have no idea how good she is, I can't say whether you should try
her.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you decide not to use a planner, then the logical
move for someone who is ``clueless'' would be to invest in mutual
funds.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to reduce your exposure to stock-market fluctuations
_ as a retired couple probably should _ you might consider putting
some of your money in mutual funds that invest in U.S. Treasuries.
</P>
<P>
   As for the portion that remains in stocks, your best bet might
be to use index funds, such as those that track the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index or the broader-based Wilshire 5000 index.
</P>
<P>
   By definition, your investments in index funds will do as well
as the market in general _ and in recent years, that has been very
well indeed. In the past 10 years, for example, the S&AMP;P 500 has
averaged roughly a 17 percent gain annually, including reinvestment
of dividends. Only a small percentage of actively managed funds did
better than that.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is no guarantee that the stock market will
continue to soar, nor is there any guarantee that the market will
continue to outperform managed funds.
</P>
<P>
   One advantage of index funds is that they charge substantially
lower fees than actively managed funds _ generally less than 0.2
percent of your invested assets per year. With a $700,000
portfolio, the annual fee would be less than $1,400. With an
actively managed fund, you probably would have to pay several times
that much.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; Figuring Estimated Tax
</P>
<P>
   Q: Sometimes I sell stocks at a capital gain, other times at a
capital loss. These sales _ and the amount I gain or lose _ can't
be predicted far in advance. This makes it difficult for me to
figure my expected income for the year when I am making my
quarterly estimated tax payments. How can I make sure that I don't
get penalized for underpaying my estimated tax?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: The law states that to avoid a penalty, you must pay in
advance an amount equal to at least 100 percent of the previous
year's tax, or 90 percent of your eventual tax bill for the present
year _ whichever is less.
</P>
<P>
   If you choose the 100-percent method, you can leave your capital
gains and losses out of the equation. Just make sure that your
estimated tax payments, combined with any money your employer
withholds from your wages, amount to at least 100 percent of last
year's tax.
</P>
<P>
   For example, suppose you paid income tax of $5,000 last year and
you expect your employer to withhold $4,000 from your wages this
year. Then you would make quarterly tax payments of $250 each time
the estimated tax falls due _ in April, June, September and
January.
</P>
<P>
   The rule is slightly more stringent if you are married filing
jointly with an income of more than $150,000, or you file
separately with an income greater than $75,000. In that case, you
would have to pay 105 percent of last year's tax bill, rather than
100 percent, to avoid a penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-percent method is more complicated, but it would be
preferable if you had an unusually large tax bill the previous year
and don't expect to approach that amount this year. In that case,
you certainly wouldn't want to prepay 100 percent of last year's
total.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, you would add up your total income to date at the end
of each quarter and assume that your income will continue at that
pace to the end of the year. You then would pay enough estimated
tax each quarter _ based on the projected annual income figure _ to
cover at least 90 percent of the year's projected tax.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if after the year is half over and you are
projecting a $6,000 tax bill, you would make sure that your
estimated tax payments plus withholding totaled $2,700 at that
point. (That's $6,000 times 90 percent divided in half.)

FOR SASQUATCH BELIEVERS THERE'S NO TURNING BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By D. PARVAZ  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, B.C. _ For those of you who thought Sasquatch fever
ended with ``Harry and the Hendersons'' _ well, you're wrong.
There's still a great deal of interest in finding one of those
creatures and making the myth a reality.
</P>
<P>
   The third annual International Sasquatch Symposium that ends
Tuesday _ or rather just the fact that there is such an event, let
alone that it's annual, international and five days long _ may
convince you.
</P>
<P>
   And as long as the creature's existence remains an unanswered
question, there are those willing to take a shot at answering it.
</P>
<P>
   Once you stop rolling your eyes at what might initially appear
to be an auditorium filled with nuts, some of the stuff actually
starts to make sense. So let's start asking some questions, like
what, exactly, is a Sasquatch and who the heck are these 200-or-so
people who believe it exists?
</P>
<P>
   The myth: The Sasquatch has been part of the mythology of just
about every culture. Among them: Yeti in Tibet, Yowie Man in
Australia and, of course, the Northwest's Sasquatch.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Page, a First Nations elder and storyteller from Mission,
B.C., says ``Sasquatch'' is the Chehalis band's word for ``Crazy
Man of the Forest.'' The Chehalis call the Sasquatch crazy because
of his solitary ways, not because they think there's a lunatic
roaming the woods. In fact, they believe the creatures are somewhat
spiritual and help tribal members when necessary.
</P>
<P>
   In a dedication ceremony, Page gave some background. ``It was
the Sasquatch that taught our people how to build our long house,''
he says. He follows his talk with a prayer that refers to the
Sasquatch as ``our brother,'' and asks for his wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in the room stands during the prayer, apparently
needing all the help they can get.
</P>
<P>
   The believers: Pity the plight of the Sasquatch hunter. People
tend to think he's crazy because, well, he has no proof that the
creature he's devoted his life to discovering even exists.
</P>
<P>
   The flimsy collection of ``evidence'' _ shaky, grainy footage,
unidentifiable hair samples, gnarled casts of big footprints _ is
inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   In quieter moments, the believer admits this to himself. And yet
he can't help himself. He's hooked.
</P>
<P>
   When considering all the eyewitness testimony and the
possibility that he's been consistently lied to, Sasquatch
investigator Thomas Steenburg shakes his head and says, ``Stop the
planet, I want to get off.''
</P>
<P>
   Steenburg, of Calgary, Alberta, even seems a little depressed
when he realizes he's spent 20 years of his life trying to find a
Sasquatch. ``Twenty years ... goes by like that,'' he says,
snapping his fingers.
</P>
<P>
   While Steenburg is one of the more outspoken characters at the
symposium, the most colorful personality is Rene Dahinden, who in
his absence, is referred to as ``The Rene Factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Dahinden is the guy everyone in the Sasquatch community knows _
for a couple of reasons.
</P>
<P>
   First off, he's been on the creature's trail since 1956, three
years after he moved to Canada from Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the matter of visibility _ Dahinden is everywhere.
He's appeared in two Kokanee beer TV commercials. Plus, the
69-year-old has a voice that can be heard in all four corners of
the symposium, denouncing findings and investigations in his thick
Euro-accent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw enough fake films. You just take one look, you dig
around a little and bingo,'' he says. And then came what Dahinden
refers to as ``that damn film'' _ aka the Patterson film.
</P>
<P>
   Shot in 1967 on 16 mm color film _ 24 feet, 60 seconds, 900
frames, each and everyone of them under copyright _ the film shows
what looks like a cross between a female human and a gorilla
(affectionately dubbed ``Patty'' by Sasquatch enthusiasts) crossing
a clearing in Bluff Creek, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   How familiar this crowd is with the film becomes evident when
John Kirk, president of the British Columbia Scientific
Cryptozoology Club _ http://www.ultranet.ca/bcscc _ is spotted
pointing out the significance of frame 352 to a timid radio
reporter in his fast-clipped English accent.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk is excited about the film, but Dahinden seems defeated by
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I set out to prove that the film is fake, because that was the
only thing that I could think you could prove,'' says Dahinden of
the footage shot by Roger Patterson, a rodeo cowboy, and Robert
Gimlin, a cattleman.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I've done for the last 30 years _ investigate this
damn film. ... But this damn film, we can't crack. People say it's
a guy in a fur suit. I don't want to listen to one more idiot. They
know nothing about nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   He says what just about everyone else does: that people in the
scientific community tend to stay away from the Sasquatch
investigation because they fear what it will do to their
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``So they are not getting involved ... but they say `bring us a
body.' If we have the body of the Sasquatch, we don't need you
(bleeps) to tell us we have one!''
</P>
<P>
   Them skeptics and them bones: So the contentious question of
Sasquatch's existence remains.
</P>
<P>
   Bigfoot believers hate to deal with that question because,
really, there's just no getting around it.
</P>
<P>
   They've never found any remains, but to most of the folks at the
symposium, that's beside the point. Take black bears, for example.
</P>
<P>
   The wildlife branch of the provincial Ministry of Environment,
Lands and Parks says there are 120,000 to 160,000 black bears in
British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mortality rate will conservatively be, say, at 10
percent,'' says Dahinden, leaving us with about 14,000 dead black
bears each year. ``One would think that you could ... step out 10
feet in the bush and fall over one of these black bears. ... You
know damn well that this isn't the case.''
</P>
<P>
   So OK, there aren't any bones because the Sasquatch is a rare
animal and its bones either get buried by dense foliage and/or
snow, or maybe it just goes to extremely remote places to die.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe the Sasquatch is an alien from another planet, a
``Hairy Angel,'' a ``Star Person.''
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, refers to the panel discussion on the
``Bigfoot/UFO Connection.''
</P>
<P>
   At the risk of sounding dismissive _ oh, what the heck _ trying
to follow the arguments by paranormal supporters John Cotton and
Jack ``Kewaunee'' Lapseritis is like trying to discuss NAFTA with
the Cheshire Cat.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy-handed with vague references to quantum physics and
metaphysics, the two hold that Sasquatch is an extraterrestrial
being, transported by aliens to Earth. They _ the Sasquatch _ are
here to give indigenous people guidance on herbal medicine and to
teach us about the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The paranormalists are not popular among the more zoologically
minded Sasquatch investigators, but symposium organizer Steven
Harvey says he feels obliged to include them in the event. ``By my
estimate ... they are 25 percent of the (Sasquatch) people, and 25
percent is something I can't ignore,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The UFO people aren't the only ones who get attacked. When Chad
Deetken, a member of the Sasquatch Society and a crop-circle
specialist, played his copy of ``The Bigfoot Recordings,'' narrated
by Jonathan Frakes of TV's ``Star Trek: The Next Generation,''
Dahinden piped up again.
</P>
<P>
   Before moving on, Deetken responded: ``I know better than to try
and argue with you, Rene.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Larry Lund, a Bigfoot investigator from Vancouver, Wash.,
also challenged the tape, calling it a total hoax. (The tape
sounded like Tom Waits, ``Sesame Street's'' Gonzo and Don Knotts
having a coughing fit at the same time.)
</P>
<P>
   Dahinden also had a bit of an outburst when Grover Krantz, a
retired professor of anthropology at Washington State University,
referred to some footprint casts.
</P>
<P>
   Krantz says the emotional reaction to Sasquatch theories is
understandable.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a little too close. This thing is close to us, close
to human,'' says Krantz, who is tall, has a head full of thick
white hair and big beard.
</P>
<P>
   He adds that some of the animosity also stems from competition
and jealousy.
</P>
<P>
   ``See, the guy who shoots the first Sasquatch gets the first
prize, the big prize,'' he says. ``After that, the scientists will
descend on this, and that's that.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no second prize.''

 _ SF CHRON  
 Netting Young Investors Through the Internet  &HT;     By Arthur M. Louis 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Financial-service companies have begun reaching out to
schoolchildren via the Internet in an effort to teach them how to
save and invest wisely.
<P>
   Educating young people about money matters certainly makes sense
in this era of 401(k) plans, individual retirement accounts and
other self-managed pension vehicles. Most of today's kids will need
to become savvy investors if they hope to remain solvent through
their sunset years.
</P>
<P>
   The educational outreach also makes sense from a business
standpoint. If a broker or mutual-fund group grabs the attention of
kids now, the kids might become customers later when they are
earning money and looking for ways to invest.
</P>
<P>
   Using the Internet to connect with the next generation of
investors is essential for any financial-services company, says
James Punishill, an analyst with Forrester Research.
</P>
<P>
   ``This generation doesn't know life without the Net, just like
you don't know life without a car,'' he observes. ``If you are a
financial institution that does business strictly the old-fashioned
way, you are dead with these consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   The full-service brokerage firms have been quickest to recognize
the importance of reaching kids through the Internet, notes Dan
Burke, a senior analyst with Gomez Advisors. Among online discount
brokers, he says, such efforts appear to be practically
nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't really realized yet the value of these potential
customers,'' Burke says.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the firm doesn't try to establish a relationship with the
children, and if something happens to the head of the household,
the account will go somewhere else,'' he observes. ``This is not
rocket science. We're just talking about keeping the relationship
open, so you don't have to constantly go out and look for new
accounts to replace ones you've lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke says kids are most likely to sample the Web sites of
financial-service firms with which their parents do business.
However, some firms attract attention to their sites by actively
marketing to kids, for example, by sending representatives to
schools to give lectures or to conduct seminars on investing.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the financial advice on youth-oriented Web pages
tends to be bland and superficial. Nobody is likely to emerge from
an online session armed with the investment wisdom and skills of a
Warren Buffett.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch, which operates what it calls a SaveLab at &QL;
</P>
<P>
   www.plan.ml.com/family/kids, exhorts children to ``curb the
spending impulse.'' It advises them to raise their own fruits and
vegetables and to go get their pizzas rather than paying tips for
delivery.
</P>
<P>
   On the Strong Funds Web site _ at www.strongkids.com _
youngsters are asked: ``Do you baby-sit or mow lawns? Maybe you
wash cars or paint picnic tables. These are all good ways to
exchange services for money.''
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly the kind of economic theorizing that wins Nobel
prizes.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the sites encourage youngsters to test their investing
skills by putting together make-believe stock portfolios. This lets
them experience the thrills of investing without the financial
risks.
</P>
<P>
   Youngsters can use the A.G. Edwards &AMP; Son site _ at &QL;
</P>
<P>
   www.agedwards.com _ to participate in monthly stock-picking
contests.
</P>
<P>
   They must choose five stocks from a list of 25, most of them
with names and products familiar to kids, such as Disney, Gap,
Kellogg, Mattel, McDonald's and Reebok. A.G. Edwards promises that
the contestants whose stocks do best each month will receive
``cool'' T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Another leading broker, Salomon Smith Barney, lets young people
create a mock portfolio of up to eight stocks _ any ones they
choose _ on its Web site at www.salomonsmithbarney.com/yin. They
can track its progress from day to day to gauge their investment
talents.
</P>
<P>
   Mindy Ross, a Salomon senior vice president for marketing, says
the youth-oriented Web program was designed to combat some common
misconceptions kids have about the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Research among young people indicates that they know a lot
about savings banks because their teachers took them there on field
trips,'' she observes. ``Kids think that savings accounts or U.S.
savings bonds are the best investments.''
</P>
<P>
   What kids do know about the stock market seems to center on the
highly volatile Internet stocks, which get a lot of publicity in
the newspapers and on television, Ross remarks. ``What we're
telling them is that you should adopt sensible investment
strategies that match your personal and financial goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Some financial-service companies insist that they aren't trying
to sell anything to the kids who surf their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch spokeswoman Katie Hynes emphatically denies that
her firm's motives are anything but selfless. '`Our main objective
is to provide financial education, which encourages better savings
habits later in life,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Other firms will admit _ after a little prodding _ that they
have a business motive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drawing new investors wasn't the main objective, but if it
happens, that's wonderful,'' says Stephanie Troug, a spokeswoman
for the Strong Funds.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Clem, manager of the Internet Services Group at A.G.
Edwards, says: ``Sure, we hope they will become customers. If we
demonstrate good corporate citizenship by providing education,
there's a hope these folks will become familiar with us and become
clients down the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Happily, none of the financial Web sites subjects the kids to
the kind of shameless, clamorous product pitches they get from toy
manufacturers and soft-drink purveyors on Saturday morning
television. You won't find any out-and-out advertisements on the
sites.
</P>
<P>
   However, most of the sites do contain a certain amount of
soft-sell mixed in with the investment text. If you are interested
in investing, the message usually goes, you could do worse than put
yourselves in our hands.
</P>
<P>
   A.G. Edwards, for example, laces its Web site with gentle
reminders that its research department provides ``many value-added
services,'' and that ``an A.G. Edwards financial consultant can
help you determine the best investment plan to meet your needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberty Financial, whose subsidiaries include the Stein Roe &AMP;
Farnham mutual fund group, ``thought it would be a great kind of
public service to go out and teach kids about investing,'' says
Jeremy Jaffe, vice president for electronic commerce. ``It had less
to do with selling our own mutual funds.''
</P>
<P>
   However, anyone who scrolls through the Liberty Financial Young
Investor site _ at www.younginvestor.com _ quickly will discover,
from repeated references, that the company sells mutual fund
shares.

 _ SF CHRON   Fogdog Nabs Nike in One Fell Swoosh 
 &HT;     By Tom Stein 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Fogdog Sports scored the Internet-partnering equivalent of a slam
dunk, hole in one and hat trick yesterday. The Redwood City firm
won an exclusive contract to sell Nike Inc.'s full line of sporting
goods on Fogdog's Web site.
<P>
   Until now, Nike had resisted joining forces with a Web retailer,
preferring to confine its online sales to its own Web site. That's
because the company did not fully trust the Internet as a retail
medium and feared that the Nike name could be tarnished through its
association with new and untested ``e-tailers,'' according to
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement will not come cheap for Fogdog. The company,
which filed to go public on Friday, has agreed to sell a 12 percent
stake to Nike.
</P>
<P>
   According to the filing statement, Nike will acquire about 6.2
million shares of Fogdog stock at $1.03 per share. Fogdog did not
disclose at what price it would offer shares to the public, but
judging from other Internet IPOs, the listing price should be well
above that figure.
</P>
<P>
   Nike chief executive Phil Knight said in a conference call that
he decided to partner with Fogdog because ``in our view, Fogdog is
the best and most aggressive sports retailer on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   John Taylor, an analyst with Arcadia Investment Group, said Nike
needed to give consumers wider access to its products and could not
continue to limit Internet sales to its own Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, Nike probably thought they could go it alone on the
Internet,'' he said. ``But then they decided it was better to be
part of something bigger. I think it was just a matter of
determining which horse to ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Nike will continue to sell its products on its own site at
www.Nike.com as well as on the sites of its traditional retail
partners, such as Nordstrom. But under the terms of the deal,
Fogdog is the only ``pure play'' Internet company with the rights
to sell Nike's complete product line on the Web. The exclusive
agreement is for six months, after which time the two companies
will reassess the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Fogdog now sells about 150 Nike products on its www.fogdog.com
Web site, but that number could balloon to many thousands under the
agreement. In the past, Fogdog consumers only had access to a
limited number of Nike's soccer products, but now, they can shop
for much more popular items such as Air Jordan basketball shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time in and time out, our customers ask us for the most
complete selection of sporting goods,'' said Fogdog chief executive
Tim Harrington. ``Nike is clearly the No.1 brand in sports
retailing. To provide a true consumer experience on Fogdog, we knew
we had to offer more than just a limited selection of Nike stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the six-month exclusive arrangement is more than
enough time to give Fogdog a leg up on its competition. Harrington
said he also would consider taking investments from other sporting
goods giants, such as Reebok and Adidas.
</P>
<P>
   Fogdog was founded about five years by three Stanford students.
Originally, the company designed Web sites for sporting goods
companies, but last November, the founders changed the name to
Fogdog and began selling products online.
</P>
<P>
   According to Media Metrix, Fogdog received more visits in July
than any other online sporting goods retailer. It competes online
against the likes of the Sports Authority and Global Sports
Interactive. But the company is still unprofitable. It lost $6.6
million on revenue of about $1 million in the first six months of
this year.
</P>
<P>
   According to its registration statement, Fogdog expects that it
will continue to incur ever-increasing operating losses for the
next several years.
</P>
<P>
   Nike, which had 1999 revenue of $8.8 billion, rose $2.56, to
$56.38, in yesterday's trading.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Now you see it, now you don't. Mayor Edward Rendell
of Philadelphia, the new chairman of the Democratic National
Committee, has un-endorsed Vice President Al Gore in the
increasingly heated campaign against former Sen. Bill Bradley of
New Jersey for the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Months ago Rendell had endorsed Gore, and he has raised hundreds
of thousands of dollars for him. Rendell was installed Saturday as
the new party chairman at the behest of Gore and President Clinton
so that the vice president would have an effective fund-raiser at
the top of the party hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   But Rendell soon began to say he wanted to be fair to both
candidates. On Sunday, Rendell was asked on the ABC News program
``This Week'' whether he still supported Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said. ``I think the vice president understands that
the _ I told the president I'd have to be scrupulous and neutral.''

 _ SF CHRON   Free-Lance Writers Win Electronic Victory 
 &HT;     By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
A union representing free-lance writers has won a federal appeals
court ruling that print publishers cannot freely reproduce their
work in electronic media.
<P>
   National Writers Union President Jonathan Tasini hailed the
court decision reversing a lower court ruling as a victory for &LR; 
thousands of &LR;  free-lance writers and photographers around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are thousands of writers who can step forward and get
the industry to do what is right,'' said Tasini, the lead plaintiff
in the case. ``That's all we're after, trying to get our fair
share.''
</P>
<P>
   The trade union, which has two main offices in New York and
Oakland, represents about 5,500 members throughout the country. The
union sued six publishers, including the The New York Times,
Newsday Inc. and Time Inc., on grounds that free-lance work
purchased for print publications could not be reproduced without
permission in electronic databases or on CD-ROMs without infringing
on the writers' copyrights.
</P>
<P>
   The case covered work published between 1990 and 1993 and did
not include work published on the Internet, which flourished after
that period.
</P>
<P>
   The recent ruling does not prevent free-lancers from signing
contracts that allow publishers to use their work in any medium,
including electronic ones. Today, free-lance contracts frequently
include rights to use the material in electronic media, although
the writers' union opposes such contracts without extra
compensation.

   In August 1997, U.S. District Judge Sonia Sotomayor of New York
ruled in favor of the publishers, saying that electronic versions
were revisions of the original work that did not require extra
payments to the free-lancers.
</P>
<P>
   The writers' union appealed the ruling, contending that
electronic reproduction on CD-ROM encyclopedias and databases like
NEXIS constituted an entirely new publication.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, a three-judge panel from the Second District Court
of Appeals in New York reversed the lower-court ruling, saying
copyright laws cover free-lance material published in their
original form, but do not extend to electronic versions.
</P>
<P>
   The court rejected the publishers' argument that the electronic
versions were merely `'revisions'' of the originals.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago attorney Patricia A. Felch, who represented the writers'
union, said the ruling ``draws a very clear line in the sand and
makes it easier for writers to understand what their rights are.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bruce Keller, the lead attorney representing the publishers,
said the ruling flies in the face of previous court rulings and
laws passed by Congress that automatically gave publishers the
electronic rights to free-lance materials.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the latest ruling could affect electronic archives
of newspapers and magazines that used stories and photographs
produced by free-lancers. He said publishers may have to seek
permission to use any free-lance story or photograph stored in
electronic archives going back several decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is impractical to suggest we go back and acquire these
rights by contract,'' Keller said.

EXPERTS WARN OUTBREAK COULD SPREAD SOUTH AS INFECTED BIRDS MIGRATE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., the Southeast)   (nk) 
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Health and wildlife officials said Monday that a mosquito-borne
illness had stricken nearly twice as many people in the New York
region as previously recognized, and they said the virus might be
present in a far larger geographic area than they originally
suspected.
</P>
<P>
   The new assessment came as experts confirmed that the virus was
not St. Louis encephalitis, as first believed, but a strain called
West Nile virus that had never been reported before in the Western
Hemisphere. Officials also attributed a fourth death to the
outbreak: a woman in her 60s from New Rochelle, N.Y., in
Westchester County, just north of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The virus is transmitted to humans from mosquitoes that have
bitten infected birds. That fact has led experts to suspect that
the virus may exist in many parts of the region, since scores of
dead crows have been turning up from Connecticut to Suffolk County
on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen crows dying in this kind of pattern in 30
years of studying them,'' said Ward Stone, the wildlife pathologist
for the New York state Department of Environmental Conservation.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, as birds continue their fall migration, some
scientists are concerned that birds carrying the virus will take it
with them as they move south. ``I think this is something we need
to be very concerned about,'' said Duane Gubler, the director of
the division of vector-borne infectious disease at the federal
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   There are now 37 confirmed cases of the West Nile virus in the
region, 25 in New York City, eight in Westchester and four in
Nassau County on Long Island. Officials had previously put the
total number of confirmed cases at 18 _ 14 of them in the city _
and no confirmed cases had been reported in Nassau before Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors are still studying human tissues and blood of eight
other New Yorkers who died since the outbreak began in August for
traces of the illness. Further, 162 cases remain under
investigation in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   One bird from Westport, Conn., has tested positive for the
illness, as has one crow from Scarsdale, N.Y., officials said. Last
Friday, health officials from the CDC confirmed that several birds
from the Bronx Zoo and its surrounding area were infected with the
West Nile strain. The state has received 523 reports of dead birds
around the region; many more are being reported among birdwatchers,
conservationists and the like.
</P>
<P>
   ``These viruses do travel with birds and bird migration has been
in process now for a better part of the month,'' Gubler said.
``There is a good possibility that this virus has already been
taken to areas further south. We are going to rethink our whole
surveillance approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Other federal agencies have put states bordering the
metropolitan region on alert to look for large pockets of dead
birds.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Monday that the change in diagnosis,
and the rise in the numbers of sick, would not change the city's
plans to spray for mosquitoes periodically as the need arises, nor
should it worry New Yorkers, because the illnesses are similar and
are prevented the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should emphasize that this is just reclassification,'' said
the mayor said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms of the illness, including fever and headache, are
usually mild. But in rare cases the virus can cause neurological
disorders and even death. Elderly people, young children and people
with weakened immune systems are most vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Experts attributed the original mistaken diagnosis to several
factors. For one thing, scientists were not specifically looking
for West Nile virus, since it had never appeared in this part of
the world. Further, the two viruses are very much alike, and can
produce similar results in diagnostic testing.
</P>
<P>
   State officials, who had not publicly commented on the outbreak
until last Friday, appeared to be taking a more active role on the
issue Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The state held its first news conference on the matter, and
Health Commissioner Antonia C. Novello announced that a
multi-agency response would now be made to an illness that is weeks
old and that the the city and other municipalities have already
responded to with mosquito spraying and other measures.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, the state Department of Health quietly enlisted
the help of a laboratory at the University of California at Irvine,
but state officials did not inform New York City or the CDC until
Sunday that the California lab had found a West Nile-like virus in
humans. ``It was not normal,'' said Gubler of the CDC, adding that
multiple labs are often called in on major health investigations.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The story of the changing diagnosis has been a fascinating one
for epidemiologists and other health experts. In early August, the
city announced that scores of people were suspected to have
contracted St. Louis encephalitis, an illness that had never been
diagnosed in New York City before and is more often found in the
South.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, wildlife experts in Albany, N.Y., and at the
Bronx Zoo, as well as birdwatchers and various other people, began
to notice the deaths of large numbers of crows around the state and
in New Jersey. Over Labor Day weekend, alarmed by the death of
birds at the Bronx Zoo, a pathologist there sent samples to the
U.S. Department of Agriculture as well as to the CDC and an Army
lab in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, state Health Department scientists
conferred with a group from the Emerging Disease lab at the
University of California at a conference in Albany, and told them
about the deaths in New York City. Officials were concerned that
although a diagnosis for St. Louis encephalitis had been made in
several cases, there will still many people who had turned up sick
and then tested negative for the illness.
</P>
<P>
   Intrigued, Dr. W. Ian Lipkin, who heads the California lab,
agreed to test New York's samples with some advanced equipment that
is used to diagnose rare and emerging illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Almost simultaneously, but without talking to each other, the
CDC was discovering a West-Nile strain in bird samples, and
Lipkin's lab was discovering it in a human brain. Although the lab
came up with its findings late Friday night, it did not immediately
alert the CDC or the city. ``Their procedure was such a novel one,
they wanted to present a credible case before presenting it,'' said
Kristine A. Smith, a spokeswoman for the state Health Department.
``And it made no difference from a public health stand point.''
</P>
<P>
   The city Department of Health stressed that public health
initiatives will not change as a result of the new diagnosis.
``This is question of two very, very rare diseases and there was
just some confusion about it but it has no impact at all,'' said
city Health Commissioner Neal L. Cohen. ``If anything, the disease
we are dealing with now is somewhat less severe than the one we
were dealing with before, so nothing about this is particularly
positive, but I guess that's movement in the right direction.''

TOLEDO SHUFFLES BRUINS LINEUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The secondary is UCLA's primary concern as its
season reaches a critical juncture. The Bruins are one loss from
Rose Bowl elimination and desperately seeking a solution after
their porous performance at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be blind not to see it,'' coach Bob Toledo said.
``The secondary played horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal passed for 465 yards _ a UCLA opponent record _ and
averaged a stunning 17 yards per attempt. As a result, the Bruins
have moved senior safety Ryan Roques to cornerback to replace
freshman Joe Hunter. Senior Eric Whitfield will fill Roques' spot
at strong safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were starting two freshmen cornerbacks, and (Stanford)
exploited us,'' Toledo said, referring to Hunter and Ricky Manning
Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins don't have many options _ in part because of injuries
and suspensions, in part because of poor play.
</P>
<P>
   Junior cornerback Marques Anderson has been suspended for the
fall quarter and senior cornerback Jason Bell is out indefinitely
with a heel injury. Without them, the Bruins have four freshman
cornerbacks: Hunter, Manning, Lovell Houston and Paul Nelson.
Houston and Nelson aren't ready to play, Hunter performed poorly
and Roques isn't in top form after missing two games for the
disabled-parking suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   The safety situation is equally dire. Joey Strycula is solid but
limited athletically. Jason Stephens, an opening-game starter,
botched several assignments and was benched. Whitfield hasn't
played to his talent level. Sophomore Julius Williams is a
converted cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got what we've got,'' Toledo said. ``There's no quick
fix. We can do patchwork stuff, but there's no quick fix.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Heel of misfortune: Bell doesn't expect to return for at
least two weeks and could miss the season if his heel does not
heal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if he'll ever be healthy,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Bell had surgery in the spring to remove bone spurs from the
inside of his right heel and it was sore throughout training camp.
To compensate for the pain, Bell placed excessive stress on the
outside of the heel, which is now the problem area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a specialist and he said I could play with pain, but if
it's not healed, I could snap the Achilles or have chronic
damage,'' Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   He won't return until he's fully recovered, both for his
football future _ he wants to play in the NFL _ and fear of
permanent damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not coming back at half speed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bell is eligible for a medical redshirt if he doesn't return.
</P>
<P>
   __ A new man? If Bell's right, the Bruins will see a new,
improved Anderson when he returns from suspension in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Marques this weekend and this thing has opened his
eyes,'' Bell said. ``It's one of the greatest things that's
happened to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was suspended in August by the dean of students for his
involvement in the handicapped-parking scandal and a prior
infraction with the dean.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's taking five or six classes at Compton College,'' Bell
said. ``He's not playing around. He's lifting weights and working
out (at Long Beach Poly). He's not taking any time off. It's a
totally different Marques.''

   WASHINGTON _ With four days left before the start of the new
fiscal year, Republican leaders in Congress formally conceded on
Monday that they would not meet the deadline for passing the annual
spending bills, and the White House laid down a new deadline, three
weeks away.
</P>
<P>
   So began the final act in a $500 billion confrontation between
Congress and the Clinton administration, which has vowed to veto
half the Republicans' spending bills. The fight is one that
President Clinton has reason to relish, and Republicans in Congress
have cause to dread.
</P>
<P>
   The White House is sitting back and watching Congress fail to
complete its appropriations work before the fiscal year ends at
midnight on Thursday, hoping and expecting that when negotiations
over spending begin next month, Clinton will once again outmaneuver
the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   October will be a month of ``pretty contentious'' arguments
between the White House and Congress over the way the government
will spend more than half a trillion dollars, Jack Lew, the White
House budget director, predicted in a discussion with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you that we're not going to be facing
brinksmanship,'' Lew said.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, in a previous bout over spending bills, Clinton
won almost every round, from the standpoint of both politics and
policy. The Republicans were bruised, and Congress wound up lashing
together a 4,000-page omnibus spending bill replete with billions
for pet projects. Almost no member of Congress read that bill
before it was passed.
</P>
<P>
   The fight, members say, was not ennobling, and few Republicans
are looking forward to a rematch.
</P>
<P>
   The result was even worse for them in 1995: when the White House
and the newly elected Republican Congress failed to strike a deal
then, much of the government shut down. Voters blamed Congress for
the closing of national parks and Washington tourist attractions
and the snarling of federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the next fiscal year rapidly approaching, Congress has
yet to complete work on nine of the 13 spending bills needed to
finance government agencies. Further, Clinton and his senior
advisers say he will veto seven of the bills if Congress passes
them in their current form.
</P>
<P>
   So, in the absence of an organizational miracle this week to
speed final congressional passage of the outstanding bills, and
unless the president changes his mind about the vetoes, the new
fiscal year will start with 10 of the 13 bills unsigned, some not
even complete.
</P>
<P>
   In formal acknowledgment that they could not complete their work
on time, Republican leaders on Monday began preparing a
``continuing resolution,'' a stopgap bill that, with the
president's signature, will finance government agencies at the
current year's spending levels for three weeks, until Oct. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials struck an impatient posture, calling
for a continuing resolution of only two weeks and implying that
Congress should hurry up and get to the bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
   ``If in the end Congress insists'' on a three-week continuing
resolution, Lew said, ``we have the expectation that Congress will
complete its work by the end of the continuing resolution. There
should be no expectations of a willingness to go on with extensions
beyond that, to just have it extended by weeks and weeks and
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   In a Rose Garden appearance on Monday, Clinton took credit for a
record surplus in the current fiscal year that the White House now
estimates at $115 billion _ $16 billion more than was projected
over the summer. Although that surplus for the current year has no
financial bearing on the debate over next year's spending, it may
increase the pressure on Congress to strike a bargain closer to the
president's position. That might allow for more spending.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, once the bargaining begins, it can end in either
compromise or chaos.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and Congress could agree on a package of
spending bills, perhaps including tax cuts far smaller than the
$792 billion, 10-year Republican package that Clinton vetoed last
week. The Republicans might bend to the president's will and
approve some of his favorite programs, in areas ranging from
foreign policy initiatives to elementary-school education. Or the
president and the Republicans could fail to strike a bargain, which
could bring a new government shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Republicans assumed control of Congress in January
1995, they have completed the appropriations process before the
deadline only once. This year the disarray and dissent in
Republican ranks over spending has been particularly strong. Fiscal
conservatives have stopped several appropriations bills in their
tracks, objecting to any increases in spending. They have warned _
and they may be proved right _ that Congress will once again spend
surplus Social Security revenue to finance government operations,
despite the solemn vows of Republican leaders not to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy in the House, where spending bills originate, has
been run in large part by the majority whip, Rep. Tom DeLay of
Texas. DeLay has said that his plan was to pass as many spending
bills as possible, try to hew to the spending limits that Congress
imposed on itself in 1997, keep away from the money in the Social
Security trust fund and then ``negotiate with the president, after
he vetoes the bills, on his knees,'' requiring him to dip into
Social Security if he wanted any new spending.
</P>
<P>
   It looks as if this strategy may fail. Most of the bills have
not passed, the spending caps are busted, and Congress is on course
to drain billions of dollars from the Social Security surplus, a
course that could have political repercussions for the Republicans
in the coming election year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Stan Collender, who advises corporate executives on government
spending as head of the Federal Budget Consulting Group at
Fleishman-Hillard, a public relations firm, said: ``There's almost
no way the Republicans can come up with a plan for the coming
fiscal year without tapping into the Social Security surplus. They
clearly have opened themselves up to a whole new level of
criticism.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In each of the seven bills Clinton threatens to veto, the
Republicans have either cut billions of dollars for his favorite
programs, or attached policy amendments that offend the White
House, or both.
</P>
<P>
   They include the House measure financing the Labor, Health and
Human Services, and Education departments, which cut close to $3
billion from Clinton's initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill for the Veterans Administration and the
Department of Housing and Urban Development kills Clinton's
Americorps job training program. Bills financing the Interior
Department and federal energy and water programs include provisions
that the White House deems anti-environmental.
</P>
<P>
   The bills for foreign operations and for the State Department
contain too little money for diplomacy, the White House argues. And
the bill financing the operations of the District of Columbia
unfairly restrict the principle of home rule for the city, the
White House contends.

ATLANTIC MONTHLY IS SOLD TO PUBLISHER OF NATIONAL JOURNAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mortimer Zuckerman has sold the venerable,
140-year-old magazine, The Atlantic Monthly, to David Bradley, a
Washington millionaire who has been trying to raise the profile of
a fledgling media empire, it was announced Monday night. The sale
was for an undisclosed sum.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of the magazine, which is known for its political and
social commentary, has been in the works for months, but came to
fruition suddenly in the last week. Bradley, who broke into the
media publishing world just two years ago by buying The National
Journal Group, approached Zuckerman about the deal, executives on
both sides said.
</P>
<P>
   Zuckerman, who made a fortune in real estate, made the magazine
his first media purchase in 1980 and since then bought U.S. News
and World Report, The Daily News and Fast Company, a rapidly
growing business magazine. Zuckerman said that the decision to
sell, which he called ``painful,'' was based on personal
considerations. ``In part, I want to spend more time with my family
and focus on fewer properties,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But it is apparent that Zuckerman is having a tough year in some
parts of his media empire. The Daily News is faced with a labor
arbitration ruling that could cost it tens of millions of dollars,
and the stock of Applied Graphics Technologies, a preproduction
publishing firm in which Zuckerman owns a significant stake, has
been trading at a fraction of its price two years ago. According to
a Conde Nast executive, Zuckerman was in serious discussions
earlier this year to sell Fast Company to Conde Nast for more than
$200 million, but the talks came to naught.
</P>
<P>
   According to both Zuckerman and Atlantic Monthly sources, the
owner and pundit did not have his heart in the relationship
anymore. A person inside Zuckerman's organization said the
magazine, which did not make a profit, had become eclipsed by Fast
Company. Morale at the magazine was down, the executive said,
because upper management had let it drift like an orphan.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1980, the magazine has been edited by William Whitworth
and has won nine prestigious National Magazine Awards as well as
dozens of lesser citations for editorial content and design. Among
the stories that garnered the magazine high praise was a detailed
history of a gun used in a murder and an article called ``Dan
Quayle Was Right,'' supporting the then vice president's attack on
single motherhood.
</P>
<P>
   But the publication, whose circulation was 459,000 at the end of
1998, does not have the stature in intellectual circles that it did
two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's interest in the publication seems to stem from a
desire to increase his new empire's media profile. A come-lately to
the publishing game, Bradley, 45, made his fortune by developing
Corporate Executive Board Co., which does management and operations
research for industrial firms. Bradley netted $142 million when the
company had a public offering, according to The Washington Post.
Bradley, who was traveling, could not be reached for comment Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The National Journal Group is well known within Washington, but
not beyond. Its glossy flagship publication, The National Journal,
has a tiny circulation of 6,600 and a reputation for serious,
nitty-gritty, policy-focused coverage. In addition, it owns several
online ventures that offer in-depth coverage of the political
machinations in the capital, including Congress Daily and The
Hotline.
</P>
<P>
   National Journal editor Michael Kelly said Bradley was buying
media properties ``primarily because he loved magazines and was a
passionate reader.'' He added that he did not believe that Bradley
was looking to be ``some kind of glitzy media player.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, serious magazines like The Atlantic and The National
Journal are hardly as lucrative as corporate consulting. ``If you
look at the history of thought-leader magazines, you do not find a
history where people have made much money,'' admits John Fox
Sullivan, The National Journal's president and publisher. Sullivan
said he expects some advertising synergies from the acquisition.
The two magazines already share a lot of the same advertisers,
</P>
<P>
   But Sullivan said that neither he nor Bradley are expecting any
easy surge in revenues. He acknowledged that to maintain such
magazines costs money, but said Bradley was committed to the task.
``We joke about having a `Field of Dreams' strategy: If you build
quality, they will come,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although National Journal makes a small profit, Bradley had used
his own resources to bolster editorial coverage. In the last 18
months, the magazine has increased the editorial budget by 60
percent, paying for a growth in staff from 125 employees to 200
</P>
<P>
   William Whitworth, The Atlantic Monthly's editor, will step down
from the helm. Bradley has not named his replacement, but Kelly is
seen as the favorite for the job. The rest of The Atlantic Monthly
staff has not be asked to move on.

IT'S A CHALLENGE FIGURING OUT WHO TO BELIEVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   We are living in the era of the Big Lie.
</P>
<P>
   Who to believe?
</P>
<P>
   No one.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, it seems, takes the cue these days from our beloved
Prez, who, with grave solemnity, peered into the television cameras
a while back and swore to an entire country, ``I did not have sex
with that woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Columnists are booted off major newspapers for fictionalizing
their prose. CNN has to recant a phony report alleging the U.S.
Army used chemical weapons during the Vietnam War. The FBI, after
six years of denial, finally admits to using pyrotechnic tear gas
canisters against the Branch Davidians. Pulitzer Prize recipients
turn out to be fabricating frauds.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in these politically correct times when the most
innocuous pronouncement can be perceived by some uptight cultural
partisan as being offensive, one has to be extremely cautious even
if what one is relating happens to be the truth, or if it happens
to be anti-establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Just look at the case of the esteemed right fielder for the Los
Angeles Dodgers, Mr. Raul Mondesi, reviled by the media for such a
dastardly deed as airing publicly his feelings about Davey Johnson
and Kevin Malone in a most colorful, X-rated manner.
</P>
<P>
   How dare Mondesi speak his mind!
</P>
<P>
   How dare he not utter those practiced, homogenized,
monosyllabic, trite quotes favored by most modern athletes!
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, a contrite Mondesi has apologized for his unseemly
outburst, and I doubt he ever again will be so rash as to betray
his innermost thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   There are those in the media who are loudly applauding Mondesi's
mea culpa
</P>
<P>
   in what smacks of blatant hypocrisy on the media's part.
</P>
<P>
   It's the media that feeds hungrily on jocks like Mondesi bold
enough to speak out, and then too often it's the media that
prissily winds up demeaning them for such candor.
</P>
<P>
   The latest person on the sporting scene to give his unvarnished
views amid controversy is the manager of the New York Mets. Mr.
Bobby Valentine, who has gone on record as saying he deserves to be
fired if the Mets fail in their pursuit to qualify for the National
League playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Now the fact that Valentine should
</P>
<P>
   be unhinged if the talented Mets continue their fascinating free
fall they have lost six straight and now find themselves a game
behind the Cincinnati Reds in the wild card race is quite
irrelevant in the context of Valentine's startling statement.
</P>
<P>
   After all, who in these deceitful times admits culpability?
</P>
<P>
   I think Pete Rose belongs in the Hall of Fame, and, for sure,
he'd have been there by now had he come clean on his past baseball
gambling sins. But he won't do so.
</P>
<P>
   The Prez blithely continues his verbal acrobatics and outrageous
parsing, no matter what the subject, or scandal, is.
</P>
<P>
   We should all follow the noble example of Valentine, who, in
voluntarily serving his noggin up on a platter, might be breaking
revolutionary new ground in tell-like-it-is ethics.
</P>
<P>
   I don't ever recall a major league manager coming out and saying
that he should be fired if his team doesn't fulfill expectations,
and Valentine should be saluted for such a gallant gesture.
</P>
<P>
   It's hoped here that Valentine has started a trend, and that
others will be as forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Kevin Malone, the Dodgers' general manager, will be moved
to say during the off-season, ``If the Dodgers are as lousy and
disappointing next season as they have been this season, I will
hand in my resignation to Rupert Murdoch and even hand him over
back pay for all the senseless money I've blown on this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the moronic coach at Baylor, Kevin Steele, who recently
cost his team a victory over UNLV when he failed to have his
quarterback take a knee on the final play of the game, will say,
``I should be banished forever from the coaching fraternity and
held up to lasting ridicule for allowing my team to lose a game it
had won.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Oscar De La Hoya, recently involved in the greatest
retreat since Dunkirk, will say, ``I embarrassed my country, my
sport and myself by running for 12 rounds against Felix Trinidad
and accepting $24 million for engaging in less serious combat than
you see in a WWF match.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Al Davis will say, ``The Raiders are finally winning now
because I'm not interfering with Jon Gruden (Raiders' head coach)
or any of the other coaches on my staff as I did so often in the
past with such disastrous results. I do nothing now but dream about
returning to L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Jerry West will say, ``I never wanted to trade Elden
Campbell. I knew how valuable he was. But the Busses (Jerry &AMP;
Jimmy) wanted him out of here, and so I got rid of him. We
certainly could use him now.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Terry Collins will say, ``We should have signed Randy
Johnson and let Mo Vaughn sulk in Boston. What a pain in the
posterior Mo turned out to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Paul Tagliabue will say, ``I've promised the networks L.A.
because they know this area has far greater visibility and
marketability than Houston. And I'll do whatever it takes for L.A.
to get an expansion team except stick it at the Coliseum.''
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't it be refreshing if people began following Valentine's
course and began bearing their souls honestly?
</P>
<P>
   Alas, it won't happen because to do so might not only set a
person up for wide-spread stricture as Mondesi discovered but, even
worse, might also cost a person enormous amounts of money.

waste. In Key West, antiquated, leaking sewage lines are allowing
raw sew age to seep into the shallows, and work crews are tearing

Weiner, administrator of Tarzana Treatment Center, after signing a
pioneering package of compromise HMO reform bills on Monday. The
bills, which among other things, make it easier for patients to sue

operations over what is left of the Sung-sam Hotel last week. Even
though the rate of earthquakes over time seems to be more or less
unchanging, the world's population explosion means that more people
are moving into quake zones. The result, experts say, is the
prospect of continuing trauma as urban areas erupt with what seems
like nearly endless bursts of destruction. (David L. Ryan/New York

 By CALVIN SIMS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOBARA, Japan _ In the center of this verdant peninsula, just
east of Tokyo, is one of the world's largest computer-screen
factories, where hundreds of humming robots and uniformed workers
in clean rooms assemble 200,000 flat panels a month.
</P>
<P>
   The factory operates around the clock. Workers have taken no
vacations for more than a year. But they still cannot work fast
enough to feed the enormous appetite for the flat-panel screens,
used in computer notebooks, video games, communications terminals
and now, increasingly, in desktop monitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we are operating nonstop at full capacity, and we
have more orders than we can possibly fill,'' said Zenzo Tajima,
product manager for Hitachi Ltd.'s displays division, which expects
its sales of the flat screens, known as liquid crystal displays, or
LCDs, to more than double this fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Business is booming for flat-screen manufacturers across Japan,
South Korea and Taiwan. The main reason is a surge in demand from
consumers and businesses around the world for personal computers
and other electronic devices that feature the flat screens, which
are increasingly appealing because they save space, look stylish
and are technologically capable of providing brilliant color images
and graphics.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for the screens is so strong that Asian producers cannot
fill 10 percent to 20 percent of orders, industry analysts and
executives said.
</P>
<P>
   The earthquake that struck Taiwan last Tuesday could worsen the
shortage if manufacturers based there cannot quickly restart
production. Power failures could delay screen-making assembly lines
on Taiwan for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Screen makers will see a huge jump in revenues this year,''
said David Mentley, a vice president at Stanford Resources Inc., a
market research firm in San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts estimate that the sales of advanced flat screens used
in laptops and desk monitors will reach $11 billion this year, up
from $7 billion last year, and that sales could reach $15 billion
in 2000 and $17 billion in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   While the shortfall has been a boon to screen producers after
years of oversupply that depressed prices and profits, it has
created big headaches for computer makers like IBM, Dell Computer
and Toshiba, which are scrambling to satisfy the appetite of
customers for notebook computers and large desktop monitors.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage has come at an awkward time. The back-to-school
buying season has been under way for weeks, and the year-end
holiday gift season is just a couple of months away. Many parents
and students are shopping for personal computers. Moreover,
companies are upgrading their computer equipment in advance of the
new millennium. Many want to get rid of the clunky cathode-ray tube
monitors that dominate their desk space and replace them with flat
screens.
</P>
<P>
   But computer industry analysts say that neither large nor small
customers are finding the discounts on notebooks and other computer
equipment that they encountered at this time last year. That partly
reflects the limited supplies of screens, which have helped push up
the prices that screen manufacturers are charging computer makers
by about 20 percent to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers also find that they often cannot buy the machine they
want without a long wait.
</P>
<P>
   Adriana Maixner, a first-year MBA student at Babson College
outside Boston, said Dell Computer's representatives told her it
would take at least three weeks to ship a popular $2,800 laptop
model with a 14-inch screen. Dell, which helped pioneer direct
sales of computers to consumers, typically can ship an order within
five days.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what they told me, that there's one supplier for the
entire industry for this size screen,'' Ms. Maixner, 26, said.
``And they said, `You're welcome to call anyone else, but you're
going to have the same problem anywhere.'''
</P>
<P>
   Neisha Frank, a spokeswoman for Dell Computer, acknowledged that
the shortage had forced the computer maker to extend its normal
lead time for product delivery. ``Some large corporate customers
cannot get what they want right away,'' Ms. Frank said. ``Yes, we
could be selling more if it were not for the LCD shortage, but
exactly how much more, who can say?''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, corporate customers are waiting several months
for delivery of popular models of computer notebooks and large
desktop monitors with advanced flat screens.
</P>
<P>
   ``All personal-computer makers are feeling the impact of this
shortage, because they can't make or sell as much product as they
would like,'' Masahiro Ono, a Tokyo-based analyst for Wahlberg
Securities, said. ``They also can't offer low discounts that
consumers like, because the companies are paying more for what used
to be an insignificant part of the computer _ the screen.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM said that the company was experiencing record demand for its
Thinkpad notebooks and that despite the screen shortage, it was
meeting the needs of most long-term customers. New customers,
however, are facing delays, which the company declined to quantify.
</P>
<P>
   Rick McGee, an IBM vice president, said that because of the
shortage, IBM was paying 30 percent to 40 percent more for flat
screens but that the increase had not been passed on to consumers,
because the company had significantly reduced the cost of other
components in its computers.
</P>
<P>
   Some U.S. computer companies said the shortage had affected them
only slightly. ``We haven't had trouble getting a steady supply of
LCDs from our supplier, but it has been hard to get them at a good
price,'' Ray Aldrick, a spokesman for Hewlett-Packard Co., said.
``It used to be the processor was the most expensive part of a
personal computer, but now it's the flat panel display.''
</P>
<P>
   Gateway Inc., which recently introduced a desktop flat-panel
model, called Profile, said that it had encountered no difficulty
meeting demand for laptops or desktops.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage in flat-screen production is partly rooted in
demand for larger screens in notebooks and desktop computers. At
the same time, Asian manufacturers, hurt by the region's severe
economic slump a few years ago, cannot increase production quickly,
because they failed to make necessary capital investments.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, responding to consumer requests for larger screens,
manufacturers shifted production of standard 12-inch displays to
13-, 14- and 15-inch screens. That reduced the number of screens
they could produce from the same raw materials.
</P>
<P>
   The shift in consumer tastes and the industry's seeming
inability to foresee it has also contributed to the shortage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers want bigger, finer-looking screens with brighter
colors and less battery power,'' said Aston Bridgman, a spokesman
for NEC Corp., which makes flat-panel screens. ``That's what's
driving this surge in demand for LCDs.''
</P>
<P>
   Many panel makers and industry analysts expect the shortage to
continue for another six months to a year, as worldwide demand for
computers continues to grow. Analysts, however, expect the shortage
to abate by the third quarter of 2000, when new factories begin
production. Eventually, supply will once again outweigh demand and
prices will drop, these analysts said.

 MOBARA, Japan: analysts said.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The industry shortage underscores how dependent the United
States is on Asia for flat-panel screens. While U.S. companies have
the basic technology to make them, they have been reluctant to
invest the hundreds of millions of dollars needed to build
large-scale factories.
</P>
<P>
   Japan accounts for about 63 percent of global production of the
flat-panel screens, while South Korea contributes 36 percent and
Taiwan about 1 percent, according to an industry study by ING
Barings Securities. The brokerage firm expects those percentages to
shift to 52 percent for Japan, 30 percent for Korea and 18 percent
for Taiwan next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``American computer companies had their chance to invest in LCD
manufacturing years ago, but they chose to let the Japanese and
Koreans duke it out, spending tens of millions of dollars on new
factories,'' Mentley of Stanford Research said. ``I don't think
that the LCD guys have a lot of sympathy for these computer
companies that have been squeezing them all these years.''

COMMENTARY: A BIRDIE IN THE BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I don't know where you were Saturday night, but it now becomes
clear that a small segment of the American population _ tiny in
number but mighty in per capita income _ was worrying about whether
our golf team could win the Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The Ryder Cup tournament is a contest between Europe and the
United States that happens every two years. Despite the
disadvantage of having to say things like ``I'm honored to be
playing for my continent,'' the Europeans won in 1995 and 1997. The
Americans had hopes that this time things would change, despite
their own burden of having to wear team shirts silly enough to have
been cribbed from ``Gilligan's Island.'' But on Saturday night,
with one day's play to go, the United States was far behind. Hope
was dwindling that our guys would be able to take home this
prestigious prize for getting a ball in the hole with the fewest
shots. Our national honor, already shaky since the Senate began
trying to balance the budget with a 13-month calendar, was on the
line.
</P>
<P>
   Then George W. Bush saved the day. The Republican candidate for
president, a friend of team captain Ben Crenshaw, came to visit the
team meeting Saturday night and read our golfers a letter from the
Alamo.
</P>
<P>
   This letter, from Col. William Travis to the American people, is
a famous, but decidedly mixed message, written by a man who was
making a valiant but unnecessary stand against an enemy that was
about to kill every person in the fort. Almost every nation
cherishes a story about a handful of brave men who willingly ride
into certain death on behalf of their country. The Alamo is our
Charge of the Light Brigade, our Siege of Thermopylae. It is sort
of hard to see it as a useful metaphor for golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have sustained a continual bombardment and a cannonade for
24 hours and have not lost a man ... Our flag still proudly waves
from the wall. I shall never surrender nor retreat ... VICTORY OR
DEATH,'' wrote Travis. As Bush read, the golfers listened intently,
perhaps imagining themselves either sinking the winning shot or
winding up impaled on their putters.
</P>
<P>
   Amazed by the incredible number of similarities between the
plight of the Texans facing death at the hands of a mass of angry
Mexican soldiers and that of the golfers facing the possibility of
entering a Cupless new millennium, the Americans rallied. Perhaps
seeing himself as Jim Bowie, firing from his sickbed at the
oncoming hordes, the final player, Justin Leonard (a Texan!), made
a 45-foot putt that put the Americans ahead. It was, as a friend of
mine remarked, an extraordinarily rare example of ``the
juxtaposition of golf and the word exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the secret of George W. Bush's success.  &UR; Things work out
for him. &LR;  Bush had stiffed the California Republican Party
convention to go to Brookline, Mass., to watch the tournament. At
first, the Texas governor's staff claimed he had a prior commitment
to attend a dinner for the Republican National Hispanic Assembly.
When it turned out later that the real scheduling conflict was
golf, Steve Forbes raced into Anaheim to remind the Californians
which candidate had blown them off and challenge Bush to about 187
debates. But by then, Bush was already part of the great victory
story. Thank heaven he went where he was needed. Otherwise those
Europeans might have marched out of Brookline with the Ryder Cup,
and Monday morning would have dawned a little dimmer from sea to
shining sea.
</P>
<P>
   Even though golf is still burdened by a long history of racial
bigotry, and frequently carried on in country clubs that make an
absolute life style out of discriminating against somebody, it's
hard to argue that it's a symbol of Bad Republicanism when
practically every politician in the country plays. Richard Nixon
forced himself to learn so he could bond with President Eisenhower,
who nevertheless continued to dislike him. Bill Clinton is probably
out on a course right now, getting a few gimmies, in the company of
Vernon Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   What I am worried about, however, is this indiscriminate use of
the Alamo pep talk. If George W. wastes it on a golf game, what
will he save for the Olympics, let alone a war?

EUROPEAN WHINE LEAVES A BITTER AFTERTASTE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Enough already.
</P>
<P>
   Enough whining from a European golf team that wouldn't look at
itself for blowing the Ryder Cup with a 4-point lead heading into
Sunday. Instead, they fell back on the tiresome refrain and blamed
``ugly Americans'' for Jose Maria Olazabal being 4-up on the 11th
and then long gone by the 18th.
</P>
<P>
   Sour grapes, it is called.
</P>
<P>
   Enough of the reaction of Sam Torrance, the assistant European
captain, who moments after one of the greatest moments in golf
history first called the behavior of the US team ``disgusting'' and
then chose these words to chastise US golfer Tom Lehman for
exulting: ``Tom Lehman's behavior was disgusting. He may call
himself a man of God, but his behavior was disgraceful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor sport'' wouldn't begin to describe Torrance. And to bring
in the words ``a man of God'' to chastise Lehman is beyond the
pale.
</P>
<P>
   Enough of the comments of Mark James, the European captain, who
said with a straight face, ``I would like to think it would not
happen with any of my players.''
</P>
<P>
   Please. If the situations had been reversed, if a European had
made such a dramatic putt, it is more likely than not that the
European team on that 17th green also would have burst into
spontaneous celebration. Human nature is no different on this side
of the Atlantic; Europeans aren't any more reserved than Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Enough of the remarks from Torrance and others on the European
team who said, incorrectly, that the American players and
supporters ``ran across Ollie's line when he had a putt to keep us
in the match.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not what happened. Justin Leonard immediately ran toward
the bottom edge of the green when his putt dropped, and the US
players, wives, and caddies sprinted from the top of the green
along the right edge (looking toward Leonard) and were nowhere
close to Olazabal's line or marker. Some media members may have
been near or on the line of the Spaniard's ball, but not the US
contingent.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt the celebration by the US team was not proper etiquette
for golf; far from it. But that was far from ordinary golf played
Sunday at The Country Club; it was emotional war between two
continents. The US team, for sure, should have waited for Olazabal
to putt before celebrating, and its celebration was certainly
ill-timed but not ill-mannered.
</P>
<P>
   Enough of the dispatches from England and other locales of how
the natives feel Americans are boors and, as one newspaper put it,
the ``United Slobs of America.'' It is all so dreary, repetitive,
and predictable. The Ryder Cup is similar to the Olympics _ which
supposedly unify different cultures _ in that many fans and media
come to the games with prejudices in full flame; they also leave
with the same prejudices. And, as any American who travels knows,
foreigners have many prejudices toward Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Enough of the bias of some in the foreign media who claimed
American fans purposely led Andrew Coltart astray on the ninth hole
when he was searching for his lost ball, who openly rooted for
Tiger Woods to miss putts, who blithely wrote that the American
team ran through Olzabal's line, and who had Jeff Maggert saying
words he had not said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most surprising were the commentators for the BBC,
supposedly a bastion of objectivity. The BBC broadcast was heard by
some at the course via radios sold at concession stands. The BBC
had a fixation on Woods and apparently brought Sigmund Freud back
from the dead as a guest commentator as, time and again, and then
again and again, the commentators chided Woods for not smiling as
much as Sergio Garcia and probed why Woods so often looked, to
them, sullen. ``Tiger does not smile after he misses a putt,'' was
one of the more amazing comments.
</P>
<P>
   Enough of the ``woe is us'' comments from Lee Westwood, Colin
Montgomerie, Paul Lawrie, and others who felt beleaguered by the US
team or its fans. Westwood, for instance, said, ``I played with
somebody (Tom Lehman) who teed it up (Saturday) when we weren't
even on the tee and I found that to be the most appalling thing
I've ever seen on a golf course.''
</P>
<P>
   Westwood had been playing slowly, and Lehman felt it was too
slow; Lehman answered with a tit-for-tat. Hardball, after all, is
played in the Ryder Cup. As for Montgomerie, a man who seems to
genuinely dislike merely being on US soil, his preoccupation with
hecklers seems beneath a golfer of his caliber and only serves to
incite more. Montgomerie's golf, though, is beyond reproach.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all who were at The Country Club Sunday, except for
the European team, will treasure it as one of the greatest sporting
days of their lives. And, from the American perspective, the
comeback was reminiscent of the US hockey team's victory over the
USSR at Lake Placid in 1980. Of all Boston's great sports moments
in our lifetimes, this ranks among the best two or three, if not
the best.
</P>
<P>
   Enough is enough.
</P>
<P>
   Americans already bash themselves and each other enough,
especially in sports. And for the Europeans to bash those American
boors and portray themselves as victims _ when they suffered one of
the great collapses in sports history or the US had pulled off one
of the great comebacks _ is unseemly. Victimhood seldom is
inspiring.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrating before Olzabal putted his ball on 17 was wrong by
the US team. But whining and complaining and moaning immediately at
day's end, instead of first acknowledging the magnificent golf the
US team displayed just to overtake them, is also far from golf's
highest standard.

IMITATING NATO: A SCRIPT IS ADAPTED FOR CHECHNYA 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Story was slugged earlier as RUSSIA-CAUCASUS)  
(nk) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's military leaders have a simple explanation for
the bombs raining down on Chechnya. They say they are copying
NATO's air campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   From the fiery explosions at the Chechen republic's oil
refineries to the attacks on the television station in Grozny,
Russia's generals say they are taking their cues from NATO's
tactics in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Gen. Anatoly Kornukov, the commander of the Russian air
force, even gave a NATO-style briefing on Saturday. Waving his
pointer, he narrated combat videos of Russian air strikes against
Chechen targets, evoking comparisons in the Russian press to NATO's
commander at the time of the Kosovo campaign, Gen. Wesley K. Clark.
</P>
<P>
   But while NATO's 78-day air campaign forced the Yugoslav
president, Slobodan Milosevic, to withdraw his troops from Kosovo,
military experts here do not anticipate an easy Russian victory.
</P>
<P>
   They warn that there are enormous differences between Yugoslavia
and Chechnya, particularly the fact that Chechnya lacks an
effective central government that could bring to heel the Islamic
militants Moscow is fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of delivering a knock-out blow, Russia's bombing strikes
may merely plunge an already lawless region into utter chaos, sow
hardship among the civilians and win new recruits for the very
militants Moscow wants to neutralize.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian military is copycatting NATO,'' said Pavel
Felgengauer, a military specialist. ``But Chechnya is not
Yugoslavia. There was one guy in Belgrade named Slobodan Milosevic
who could make decisions. In Chechnya, nobody is in charge. You
can't bomb Chechnya into submission because there is nobody to
submit.''
</P>
<P>
   In a political sense, it is not hard to understand why Moscow
might be tempted to imitate NATO's success.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's latest trouble in the Caucasus began in August when
thousands of Islamic militants streamed across the border into
Dagestan, seeking to establish an Islamic state. The militants were
under the leadership of Shamil Basayev, a Chechen warlord, and a
man known as Khattab, a Chechen who was born in the Middle East.
Neither is under the control of the Chechen president, Aslan
Maskhadov.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel incursion into Dagestan was an unwelcome challenge to
the Kremlin, already preoccupied by political intrigue. None of its
options was good.
</P>
<P>
   The most conservative approach, and the one that Russia
initially seemed to settle on, was to evict the rebels from
Dagestan and then try to contain them within Chechnya. That was the
least risky course but one that left the initiative with the
militants.
</P>
<P>
   A second option was to mount an all-out ground invasion to rid
Chechnya of the rebels once and for all. That approach evoked
bitter memories of the disastrous Chechen war, which ended in 1996.
Many military experts believe an invasion is politically
unsustainable and beyond the means of the deteriorating Russian
military.
</P>
<P>
   A third option was air power, the high-tech, relatively low-cost
approach that NATO applied so effectively in Yugoslavia. It offered
a way to strike back at the militants while holding down Russian
losses.
</P>
<P>
   After a month of tangling with rebels in Dagestan, and a series
of mysterious fatal bombings in Russia that left the people fearful
and the government blaming the militants, Moscow embraced an air
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Kornukov proudly declared that there were ``certain parallels''
between the Russian air strikes in Chechnya and the NATO campaign
in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kremlin is using the scheme NATO applied in Kosovo,'' the
newspaper Vremya declared Monday.
</P>
<P>
   As did NATO, the Russian air force first moved to establish its
superiority in the skies over Chechnya. It began by bombing a radar
unit at the Grozny airport and destroying the Chechen ``air
force,'' which consisted of a single, propeller-driven biplane.
</P>
<P>
   As did NATO, the Russian air force moved on to Chechnya's
communications network. It bombed the republic's cellular telephone
exchange, saying it needed to prevent the rebels from talking to
each other. And it attacked Chechnya's television station.
</P>
<P>
   And as NATO did, Russian warplanes bombed oil refineries. The
Russian justification was that the rebels traded in oil on the
black market and the air strikes would deprive them of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   And as with NATO, Russia's commanders have sought to prepare the
public for a drawn-out campaign. Russian officials have even left
open the option of a limited ground offensive. But so did NATO,
though Western officials insisted it would be a last resort.
</P>
<P>
   It is the differences, however, that worry many analysts here.
</P>
<P>
   With all of its training and precision-guided ordnance, NATO had
its share of ``collateral damage,'' the military's antiseptic term
for the accidental killing of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian air force says it is attacking targets in Chechnya,
using SU-25 attack aircraft and SU-24 bombers, equipped with
precision weapons. It is likely, however, that most of its ordnance
consists of ``dumb'' gravity bombs.
</P>
<P>
   One Chechen said in a telephone interview Monday that there were
many civilian casualties. ``They are hitting houses and
buildings,'' he said. ``The hospitals are full of injured people.''
</P>
<P>
   Kazbek Makhashev, a deputy minister in the Chechen government,
said in a statement that more than 420 people have been killed by
the Russian air strikes since early September and that more than
1,000 have been wounded.
</P>
<P>
   According to reports from the neighboring republic of
Ingushetia, much of the Chechen public is in a state of panic. More
than 30,000 Chechens, and perhaps as many as 50,000, have fled
across the border seeking refuge from the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest dissimilarity between Russia's air assault and
NATO's campaign involves strategy.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's attacks put enormous pressure on Belgrade to withdraw its
soldiers from Kosovo. But no matter how hard Russia bombs Chechnya,
Maskhadov has little, if any, influence with Basayev and the
militants, most analysts say. The attacks may even end up
strengthening the rebels by fueling public resentment against
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to justify the Russian bombardment, a senior Russian
official said that there was a vacuum of authority in Chechnya and
that Russia's military campaign would show who was in control.
</P>
<P>
   Boris A. Berezovsky, the tycoon who has involved himself in
politics in the region, took a different tack. He said only
dialogue with the Chechen authorities and efforts to rebuild the
republic would contain the rebels' influence and prevent future
acts of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   With anti-Chechen feeling running high in Moscow, some analysts
have questioned whether the air raids are simply a matter of
settling scores. They warned that the fighting might spin out of
control with unpredictable consequences for Russia, as well as the
Caucasus.

IMITATING NATO: A SCRIPT IS ADAPTED FOR CHECHNYA 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Story was slugged earlier as RUSSIA-CAUCASUS)  
(nk) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's military leaders have a simple explanation for
the bombs raining down on Chechnya. They say they are copying
NATO's air campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   From the fiery explosions at the Chechen republic's oil
refineries to the attacks on the television station in Grozny,
Russia's generals say they are taking their cues from NATO's
tactics in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Gen. Anatoly Kornukov, the commander of the Russian air
force, even gave a NATO-style briefing on Saturday. Waving his
pointer, he narrated combat videos of Russian air strikes against
Chechen targets, evoking comparisons in the Russian press to NATO's
commander at the time of the Kosovo campaign, Gen. Wesley K. Clark.
</P>
<P>
   But while NATO's 78-day air campaign forced the Yugoslav
president, Slobodan Milosevic, to withdraw his troops from Kosovo,
military experts here do not anticipate an easy Russian victory.
</P>
<P>
   They warn that there are enormous differences between Yugoslavia
and Chechnya, particularly the fact that Chechnya lacks an
effective central government that could bring to heel the Islamic
militants Moscow is fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of delivering a knock-out blow, Russia's bombing strikes
may merely plunge an already lawless region into utter chaos, sow
hardship among the civilians and win new recruits for the very
militants Moscow wants to neutralize.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian military is copycatting NATO,'' said Pavel
Felgengauer, a military specialist. ``But Chechnya is not
Yugoslavia. There was one guy in Belgrade named Slobodan Milosevic
who could make decisions. In Chechnya, nobody is in charge. You
can't bomb Chechnya into submission because there is nobody to
submit.''
</P>
<P>
   In a political sense, it is not hard to understand why Moscow
might be tempted to imitate NATO's success.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's latest trouble in the Caucasus began in August when
thousands of Islamic militants streamed across the border into
Dagestan, seeking to establish an Islamic state. The militants were
under the leadership of Shamil Basayev, a Chechen warlord, and a
man known as Khattab, a Chechen who was born in the Middle East.
Neither is under the control of the Chechen president, Aslan
Maskhadov.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel incursion into Dagestan was an unwelcome challenge to
the Kremlin, already preoccupied by political intrigue. None of its
options was good.
</P>
<P>
   The most conservative approach, and the one that Russia
initially seemed to settle on, was to evict the rebels from
Dagestan and then try to contain them within Chechnya. That was the
least risky course but one that left the initiative with the
militants.
</P>
<P>
   A second option was to mount an all-out ground invasion to rid
Chechnya of the rebels once and for all. That approach evoked
bitter memories of the disastrous Chechen war, which ended in 1996.
Many military experts believe an invasion is politically
unsustainable and beyond the means of the deteriorating Russian
military.
</P>
<P>
   A third option was air power, the high-tech, relatively low-cost
approach that NATO applied so effectively in Yugoslavia. It offered
a way to strike back at the militants while holding down Russian
losses.
</P>
<P>
   After a month of tangling with rebels in Dagestan, and a series
of mysterious fatal bombings in Russia that left the people fearful
and the government blaming the militants, Moscow embraced an air
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Kornukov proudly declared that there were ``certain parallels''
between the Russian air strikes in Chechnya and the NATO campaign
in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kremlin is using the scheme NATO applied in Kosovo,'' the
newspaper Vremya declared Monday.
</P>
<P>
   As did NATO, the Russian air force first moved to establish its
superiority in the skies over Chechnya. It began by bombing a radar
unit at the Grozny airport and destroying the Chechen ``air
force,'' which consisted of a single, propeller-driven biplane.
</P>
<P>
   As did NATO, the Russian air force moved on to Chechnya's
communications network. It bombed the republic's cellular telephone
exchange, saying it needed to prevent the rebels from talking to
each other. And it attacked Chechnya's television station.
</P>
<P>
   And as NATO did, Russian warplanes bombed oil refineries. The
Russian justification was that the rebels traded in oil on the
black market and the air strikes would deprive them of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   And as with NATO, Russia's commanders have sought to prepare the
public for a drawn-out campaign. Russian officials have even left
open the option of a limited ground offensive. But so did NATO,
though Western officials insisted it would be a last resort.
</P>
<P>
   It is the differences, however, that worry many analysts here.
</P>
<P>
   With all of its training and precision-guided ordnance, NATO had
its share of ``collateral damage,'' the military's antiseptic term
for the accidental killing of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian air force says it is attacking targets in Chechnya,
using SU-25 attack aircraft and SU-24 bombers, equipped with
precision weapons. It is likely, however, that most of its ordnance
consists of ``dumb'' gravity bombs.
</P>
<P>
   One Chechen said in a telephone interview Monday that there were
many civilian casualties. ``They are hitting houses and
buildings,'' he said. ``The hospitals are full of injured people.''
</P>
<P>
   Kazbek Makhashev, a deputy minister in the Chechen government,
said in a statement that more than 420 people have been killed by
the Russian air strikes since early September and that more than
1,000 have been wounded.
</P>
<P>
   According to reports from the neighboring republic of
Ingushetia, much of the Chechen public is in a state of panic. More
than 30,000 Chechens, and perhaps as many as 50,000, have fled
across the border seeking refuge from the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest dissimilarity between Russia's air assault and
NATO's campaign involves strategy.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's attacks put enormous pressure on Belgrade to withdraw its
soldiers from Kosovo. But no matter how hard Russia bombs Chechnya,
Maskhadov has little, if any, influence with Basayev and the
militants, most analysts say. The attacks may even end up
strengthening the rebels by fueling public resentment against
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to justify the Russian bombardment, a senior Russian
official said that there was a vacuum of authority in Chechnya and
that Russia's military campaign would show who was in control.
</P>
<P>
   Boris A. Berezovsky, the tycoon who has involved himself in
politics in the region, took a different tack. He said only
dialogue with the Chechen authorities and efforts to rebuild the
republic would contain the rebels' influence and prevent future
acts of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   With anti-Chechen feeling running high in Moscow, some analysts
have questioned whether the air raids are simply a matter of
settling scores. They warned that the fighting might spin out of
control with unpredictable consequences for Russia, as well as the
Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   ``A war is not planned this way,'' Andrei Piontkovsky, a
political analyst, wrote in the newspaper Novaya Gazeta. ``Only a
bloody massacre.''

MIXED REVIEWS ON THE US TEAM'S GAUDY SHIRTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER AND MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ The Americans made a statement with their
play on the final day of Ryder Cup competition, and they also a
statement with their uniform tops. Justin Leonard's putt and the US
shirts remained the two major topics of conversation Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The shirts, manufactured by Jeff Rose &AMP; Co., feature photographs
of victorious Ryder Cup teams from the last six decades. The
photographs are framed in antique Burlwood and silver and arranged
on a burgundy background. &UR;  &LR; It took 14 different screens to complete
the print.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story behind the shirt is that when (Ben) Crenshaw won the
1995 Masters, he was in a Jeff Rose &AMP; Co. shirt with antique Bobby
Jones photographs printed on it,'' said Preston Piermattei of the
company. ``He felt like it was a good-luck piece for him. So when
he went to decide players' uniforms, he asked for a Ryder Cup
evolution to that shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Rose &AMP; Co. printed 33 shirts for team and PGA officials,
and they're not for resale. If they were to retail, the shirts
would cost approximately $150, slightly more expensive than the
manufacturer's regular line.
</P>
<P>
   But the question remains, would golf fans buy them? A survey of
Ryder Cup spectators Sunday found the shirts unattractive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the shirt very much at all,'' said Fred Wahlers
of Charlestown. ``Something in red, white, and blue would have been
appropriate. I think the wives are dressed superbly. I can
understand the concept of past champions, but it doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   But others were willing to sacrifice good taste for the sake of
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all right,'' said Mike Lindsey of Lake View, Mich. ``I
wondered at first. They're a little different from your stripes and
colors. But look at the scoreboard, they're working.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Please Mr. Postman
</P>
<P>
   Unwilling to carry hundreds of dollars of merchandise around 18
holes? Looking for a convenient post office open on a Sunday? A
tent along the first fairway housed a full-service post office
during the tournament. You could mail letters and buy stamps, but
most patrons were mailing home large loads of merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little unusual to be open Sunday,'' said Carolyn Derby,
manager of retail for the Boston postal district, ``but when people
have special events, they need you through the course of the
events.''
</P>
<P>
   Derby estimated the office mailed 800-1,000 packages each day of
the tournament, with the parcels costing an average of $4 to ship.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hold the tuna
</P>
<P>
   The fan outburst that ticked off Colin Montgomerie and sent
security scrambling and Payne Stewart into a fit on the fifth hole
Sunday was a cry of, ``Tuna!'' During Montgomerie's backswing on
his second shot on the par-4 hole, a fan yelled out the nickname of
Jets coach Bill Parcells, who bears a resemblance to the Scot . . .
Football was on the mind of a few fans at the fifth. When
Montgomerie paused after being heckled, a fan shouted, ``Come on,
Monty, hit the ball. We've got to get home for the Sunday night
Patriots.'' . . . Inappropriate fan before was not limited to
catcalls. As Leonard and Jose-Marie Olazabal walked up the 18th
fairway, a spectator donned a plastic mask, ran across the first
fairway, and belly-flopped into a sand trap. He got up and said,
``That was fun,'' then wobbled away as a marshal pursued him.
During the Americans' victory celebration on No. 18, a few fans
received a Brookline Police escort off the premises, but no arrests
were made.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Using the drivers
</P>
<P>
   The traffic nightmare that organizers and local residents feared
never became reality. Public transportation ended up working out
better than anyone expected, according to operations overseer Mike
Gilligan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was such a community effort like I've not seen before,''
said Gilligan. ``I think that was the whole key here. We really
showed why the PGA of America goes into communities and customizes
our events to the community. The T service was unbelievable and so,
so, so successful. It was our biggest success story as far as
public transportation at any event we've ever come across, without
question.''
</P>
<P>
   The only problem Gilligan and his staff had not anticipated was
a shooting in the Jamaica Plain area that diverted Ryder Cup
traffic as police searched for the gunman.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Remember this?
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw, a Texan through and through, recalled Texas's greatest
scene of bravery _ the Alamo _ to motivate his nearly dispirited
team for the decisive singles matches in the Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   And Gov. George W. Bush of Texas just happened to be in
Brookline to add the final touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Bush came in and read us the speech of the Alamo that
William Barrett Travis wrote before the Alamo fell in 1836,'' said
Crenshaw. ``And it was a great speech, great words.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first line of it: `We were beieged by the enemy . . .,'
and we were at that time, against some pretty insurmountable
odds.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw, his wife Julie, and other members of the entourage
also put together a video (``part of it funny, part of it
serious,'' said Phil Mickelson), for that team meeting Saturday
night, which was described by all the US golfers as emotional.
Player after player spoke to the team. ``From the heart,'' said
Crenshaw. ``They all spoke from the heart. It was very emotional.''
</P>
<P>
   The team, Crenshaw went on, ``already had a closeness in spirit
and bond. And it's very strong when you put together those feelings
in writing to do something, put them together.''
</P>
<P>
   And the result of the emotional motivational meeting . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a pretty powerful machine out there,'' said Crenshaw,
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The matchup game
</P>
<P>
   When that precious final half-point had been earned by Leonard,
US assistant captain Bruce Lietzke shouted out, ``It was the
pairings.'' Lietzke jumped around the 17th green repeating those
words over and over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how much we agonized over our pairings,''
said Lietzke. ``And it was agony since we kept moving guys around,
changing the pairings, and moving a guy up or bringing a guy down.
It was hell.''
</P>
<P>
   The US captains had two tasks: front-load their pairings so the
team could gain a quick edge during the early matches Sunday to
build momentum. But, said Lietzke, ``We also had to try and guess
what (the Europeans) would do.'' The US brain trust didn't know
about its final pairings of the day _ aside from Jeff Maggert _ and
kept juggling names.
</P>
<P>
   If Tom Lehman was a natural to start out the day, in case the
Europeans started with a Colin Montgomerie, for instance, ``We were
also pretty sure we wanted to go with Jeff in the final match,''
said Lietzke. ``He's our most solid ball-striker and we were
confident with Jeff there. Of course, it didn't turn out that
way.'' Maggert was beaten by Scotland's Paul Lawrie.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real agony was over the middle pairings,'' said the
assistant captain. ``Ben and the rest of us wanted to do this and
then we wanted to move it around. We kept moving guys back and
forth until the very last minute.''
</P>
<P>
   And the name of Leonard?
</P>
<P>
   ``He was around the eighth or ninth pairing but we moved him a
few times,'' said Lietzke. ``He'd be up one or down one or two. And
then we put Justin ninth.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, was the perfect slot for the Americans.

CLINTON RAPS GIULIANI ON ART THREAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hillary Rodham Clinton criticized Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani Monday for threatening to close down the Brooklyn Museum
of Art if it goes ahead with an exhibition that he finds offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Giuliani lashed back, saying Clinton's
comments meant that ``she agrees with using public funds to bash
the Catholic religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a source close to the mayor said the museum had
agreed to a compromise that would let the show go on, but a museum
spokesman denied this claim.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor and the first lady, the likely candidates in the race
for US Senate, have not clashed so intensely on any issue until
now.
</P>
<P>
   A Giuliani-Clinton race is predicted to be close one, and close
races in New York are often decided by the Catholic vote, which is
particularly crucial ``upstate.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Clinton way ahead of Giuliani in New York City, where
Democrats outnumber Republicans 4 to 1, and Giuliani way ahead of
Clinton in the city's suburbs. Upstate, which is what city and
suburban New Yorkers call everyplace else in the state, is where
the race is likely to be particularly intense. It is no coincidence
that, in her pre-campaign ``listening tour,'' Clinton spent most of
her time upstate.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over the Brooklyn Museum was sparked last week,
when Giuliani became aware of its much-publicized show of British
art, called ``Sensation,'' scheduled to open Oct. 2.
</P>
<P>
   The show, which drew vast crowds and controversy in London and
Berlin two years ago, includes a shark in formaldehyde, a cut-up
pig, and _ most provocatively _ a painting of the Virgin Mary
smattered with elephant dung.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani took offense and issued an ultimatum to the museum:
Cancel the exhibit or he will terminate city financing of the
museum.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of New York City's cultural centers, the Brooklyn
Museum is in a city-owned building and receives heavy subsidies for
routine operating expenses: $7 million a year in the Brooklyn's
case, plus $14 million for a capital-improvement project.
</P>
<P>
   Without the city subsidy, these centers, which also include the
Metropolitan Museum, the Natural History Museum, and the
avant-garde gallery P.S. 1, could not function.
</P>
<P>
   This may explain why every other cultural director in the city
has remained uncannily silent in the face of the mayor's attack.
``They're shaking in their boots,'' said a lawyer, who spoke on
condition that he not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton worded her criticism of the mayor very carefully Monday.
Asked about the dispute, she said outside a school in Harlem, ``I
share the feeling, that I know many New Yorkers have, that there
are parts of this exhibit that would be deeply offensive. I would
not go to see this exhibit.''
</P>
<P>
   However, she noted that Peter Vallone, the speaker of the New
York City Council, ``is a devout Catholic who attends Mass every
day,'' and yet Vallone ``understands that it is not appropriate to
penalize and punish an institution such as the Brooklyn Museum that
has served this community with distinction over many years, that
employs more than 500 people, that had over 500,000 visitors last
year, and provided a lot of services to citizens of New York and
especially the people of Brooklyn.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said she agrees with Vallone, and added, as an extra jab
at the mayor, ``That is the position that everyone who thinks about
this issue should be taking.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has said that while the First Amendment protects free
expression, it does not guarantee taxpayer dollars for expression
that many people find ``disgusting.''
</P>
<P>
   Some constitutional lawyers disagree, arguing that the
government does not have to subsidize art but, once it does, it
cannot withdraw the money for reasons having to do with the art's
content.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and the mayor, have not yet formally announced their
candidacies for senator, but she recently said she is leaning very
heavily in that direction, and she now seems to be attacking her
likely foe with new enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   She also attacked the mayor Monday for allowing the
deterioration of New York public schools.

CARDINAL LAW TROUBLED BY SJC NOMINEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Cardinal Bernard Law has raised objections to two of
Governor Paul Cellucci's nominees for positions on the Supreme
Judicial Court, saying their records leave them ``open to serious
charges of anti-Catholicism.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone call and private letter to Cellucci, Law said
past legal actions taken by Supreme Judicial Court Justice Margaret
Marshall and Superior Court Judge Judith Cowin give him a ``sense
of unease'' about the two.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern has to do with an attitude and mentality, which I
find troubling,'' Law said in the Sept. 22 letter to Cellucci, a
copy of which was obtained by the Globe. ``I fear that in both
these nominees there has been evidenced a certain mindset which at
times is open to the serious charge of anti-Catholicism.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci is seeking to elevate Marshall from associate SJC
justice to chief justice, and appoint Cowin to fill an SJC vacancy.
</P>
<P>
   Law stopped short of asking Cellucci to withdraw the
nominations, but urged him to investigate what he said is evidence
of the judges' negative feelings about Catholicism. Neither
Marshall nor Cowin is Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   Objections from the cardinal, who commands respect and clout on
Beacon Hill, could signal the most serious challenge the jurists
will face as they seek confirmation from the eight-member
Governor's Council. Marshall's nomination to lead the court will be
taken up Wednesday, while Cowin will be considered in the weeks
ahead. A majority of council members are Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   John Walsh, a spokesman for the archdiocese, said Law was out of
the country Monday and unavailable for comment. Walsh refused to
confirm the cardinal had sent a letter to Cellucci and would not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, Law referred to a complaint Governor's Councilor
Edward O'Brien received this month from a Springfield attorney who
said Cowin displayed anti-Catholic bias in a 1997 case involving
Carney Hospital. In the case, a Norfolk County Superior Court jury
found the employee was wrongly fired because managers at the
church-affiliated facility thought he was gay. He was awarded $1.2
million.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer said Cowin increased the award the plaintiff received
from the hospital, which is part of the archdiocese-run Caritas
Christi network. The lawyer, John J. Egan, quoted Cowin's
justification for the increase on the problems ``inherent in suing
a respected Boston Charitable institution . . . (and) the strength
of the Catholic Church.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot believe such a stereotype exists in a Judge's mind,''
Egan wrote in his letter to O'Brien. ``The church was not a party
to this case. The idea that it is a strong public force advocating
discrimination is offensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Egan also cited another case in which Cowin allowed for the
cross-examination of a Catholic woman's religious views in an
employment termination case. ``The whole situation is outrageous,''
said Egan.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci spokeswoman Sean Feddeman said the governor was not
available to comment on the letter Monday. The governor's chief
counsel, Leonard L. Lewin, who oversees judicial nominations, did
not return a phone call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Cowin, whom former Governor William F. Weld appointed to the
bench in 1991, did she not return a phone call late Monday. O'Brien
confirmed Monday that he had received the letter from Egan, but
would not comment on it.
</P>
<P>
   Law said his concern with Marshall stems from a letter she wrote
while general counsel at Harvard University to Mary Ann Glendon, a
Harvard law professor and leading American Catholic intellectual
who is an antiabortion advocate. The cardinal did not detail the
contents of the letter, but he told the governor that Councilor
David Constantine has a copy of the letter and urged him to review
it.
</P>
<P>
   Constantine, a Democrat from New Bedford, did not return calls
made to his office and home Monday. Marshall was not available for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Law's letter to Cellucci surfaces as Marshall faces opposition
on another front from several members of the Governor's Council,
which much approve her nomination.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien, the council's longest-serving member and father of
state Treasurer Shannon O'Brien, said he would oppose Marshall
because he feels that she does not have enough courtroom experience
on the SJC to be its chief. Marshall was appointed by Weld in late
1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned she hasn't had the time in service,'' said
O'Brien, an Easthampton Democrat. He said he has reviewed her
opinions and has no ``quarrels'' with her judicial decisions.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Brien also denounced Cellucci for suggesting that his
opposition to Marshall and his questioning of Cowin is based on
their gender. On several occasions since he nominated Marshall,
Cellucci has denounced the opposition to her and other appointments
of women as gender bias.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very unhappy the governor would stoop to that kind of
language,'' O'Brien said. ``If I disagree with him, I disagree with
courtesy.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien said his daughter had called him urging him to support
Marshall's elevation, which would make her the first woman to lead
the court.
</P>
<P>
   But he has not budged. He is expected to be joined by
Constantine and Councilor Michael Callahan, a Democrat from
Medford, in opposing Marshall's elevation. Lieutenant Governor Jane
Swift can cast the deciding vote if there is a tie.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci's nomination of Appeals Court Judge Francis X. Spina to
the SJC is also before the council. Spina is expected to be
confirmed, despite concerns raised about his hiring a paralegal who
is a convicted murderer serving a prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Law and Cellucci have sparred over issues involving the Catholic
Church in the past, including the death penalty and abortion.
Cellucci favors the death penalty, which Law has opposed as not in
line with Vatican teaching on capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1991, Law said Cellucci should not be permitted to
deliver a commencement address at Hudson Catholic High School,
Cellucci's alma mater, because the then-lieutenant governor
supported abortion rights.

 &HT;    Dell signs multi-billion dollar agreement with IBM
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Dell Computer Corp., continuing to expand its
offerings beyond the build-to-order personal computers that made
the company famous, said Monday it signed another multi-billion
agreement with IBM Corp. that will help Dell move up the computer
industry's food chain.
</P>
<P>
   IBM, the world's biggest computer company, will install and
maintain Dell equipment for government agencies, schools and major
corporate accounts in an alliance valued at $6 billion over seven
years.
</P>
<P>
   With a separate $16 billion pact announced in March that gives
Dell access to IBM components, Monday's deal adds up to the biggest
alliance in the industry's history, Dell Vice Chairman Kevin
Rollins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view this as a strategic relationship that will continue to
evolve over time,'' Rollins said during a press conference in New
York. While Dell shows little desire to be Little Blue _ a smaller
version of IBM, _ the Round Rock-based company continues to add
products and services that broaden its appeal beyond the desktop
that launched its business in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Dell has announced a variety of programs _
from Internet access to an auction site for used computers and
accesssories to an online superstore of PC peripherals _ designed
to capture more of the consumer business.
</P>
<P>
   While Dell executives say those moves are a natural extension of
the company's contact with customers, they also provide continuing
revenue beyond the sale of a PC.
</P>
<P>
   What's pushing the changes at Dell _ and similar changes at
other PC makers _ is steadily declining prices for desktop
computers. Average PC prices are down about 13 percent from a year
ago, according to Forrester Research Inc., and after years of
growth, Forrester predicts consumer spending on PCs will begin to
decline next year.
</P>
<P>
   For all the attention focused recently on Dell's overtures to
consumers, the company is only No. 6 in the market, according to
another research company, International Data Corp. Consumers
account for only about 15 percent of Dell's sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if they're ever going to succeed as much as they
would like to in the consumer space,'' said Forrester's Eric
Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's announcement is a reminder that Dell's primary focus
remains large corporate, government and educational customers that
accounted for most of the $11.7 billion in sales during the first
two fiscal quarters. Sales of workstations, servers and
data-storage products used by businesses and other organizations
increased by 85 percent in the second quarter over the same quarter
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement surprised some industry analysts more than the
March deal because it means one IBM division will become a key
partner in Dell's efforts to win business that IBM's money-losing
PC division may also be bidding for. Even for a fast-changing
industry that is forcing former foes into strategic alliances, the
Dell-IBM agreement is unusual, said Eric Rocco, an analyst with
Dataquest Inc. in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have a situation where Dell is using a neck-and-neck
competitor to do its service,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dell has similar service alliances with companies such as
GetronicsWang, Unisys Corp., NCR Corp. and BancTec, which provide
large Dell customers a range of services, from designing and
installing systems to offering simple repairs, known in the
industry as ``break-fix'' repairs.
</P>
<P>
   But with offices in 162 foreign cities, 131,000 employees and
22,000 field technicians, IBM significantly bolsters the services
that Dell can offer. Those services initially will be limited to
U.S. customers when the program is started in the first quarter of
next year, but they will expand overseas in subsequent months,
Rollins said.
</P>
<P>
   Dell Senior Vice President Rosendo Parra said Monday that many
large customers indicated they would do more business with Dell if
they could get service from IBM. That created the dilemma of
forming a close linkage with someone that Dell regularly bids
against for corporate business.
</P>
<P>
   ``When customers first brought the companies together, it was
very awkward,'' Parra said. ``The thought was, here's one of our
competitors for hardware servicing our machines.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Monday's deal, IBM had to convince Dell that its
technicians wouldn't favor IBM PCs over Dell machines, Parra said.
</P>
<P>
   While Dell executives say computer services can be a $10 billion
business for the company in several years _ up from an estimated
$1.4 billion last year _ they have no plans to grow a large
computer-services organization. Dell's in-house service operation _
small by industry measures _ has only about 3,500 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Dell executives point to Compaq Computer Corp.'s stumble this
spring as vindication for their strategy of partnering with
established service providers instead of acquiring them.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq's problems, including staggering losses and the departure
earlier this year of its chief executive and a handful of other top
executives, are blamed in part on Compaq's inability to mesh
Digital Equipment Corp.'s culture with its own.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts nearly unanimously praised Compaq's decision to
purchase DEC in the months following the January 1998 announcement
because Digital had a worldwide services operation. At the time,
many pointedly warned that Dell risked falling behind its top
competitors unless it acquired a service provider such as Unisys or
what was then Wang Global.
</P>
<P>
   That advice is less common these days, as Dell has consistently
been the most profitable and fastest-growing PC company.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent meeting with analysts, Chief Executive Michael Dell
reiterated that he thinks his company can make money off the
burgeoning services industry _ expected to be a $500 billion market
by 2003 _ without a large in-house operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the sweet spot of profit opportunity for us is not
deploying arms and legs in a break-fix context,'' he said.

 &HT;    Barnes admits to helping Bush get into Air National Guard
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Former Texas House Speaker Ben Barnes put in a
well-placed good word to help young George W. Bush get into the Air
National Guard when thousands of Bush's contemporaries were
shipping out to Vietnam, his lawyer said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued on his behalf, Barnes said he made the
phone call to the head of the Texas Air National Guard at the
request of the late Sidney Adger, a Houston oilman and longtime
Bush family friend.
</P>
<P>
   But Barnes said nobody in the Bush family had asked him to
intervene. When Bush joined the Guard in 1968, his father was a GOP
congressman from Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither Congressman Bush nor any other member of the Bush
family asked for Barnes' help,'' the lawyer's statement said.
``Barnes has no knowledge that Governor Bush or President Bush knew
of Barnes' recommendation.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement said Barnes ``was contacted by Sid Adger and asked
to recommend George W. Bush for a pilot position with the Air
National Guard.''
</P>
<P>
   At a Houston campaign stop on Monday, Bush said he did not know
whether Barnes had intervened on his behalf in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never asked for, (and) I don't believe I received, any
special treatment,'' said Bush, who served in the Guard, based in
Houston, from 1968 to 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's military record became part of a federal lawsuit when
former Texas Lottery Director Lawrence Littwin alleged that Gtech,
operator of the state lottery, was behind his 1997 firing after
five months on the job.
</P>
<P>
   Littwin's lawsuit claims Gtech held sway over the Texas Lottery
Commission because of Barnes' knowledge about how Bush got into the
Guard. But Gtech had severed its ties with Barnes, formerly the
firm's top Texas lobbyist, before Littwin was hired by the Lottery
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Gtech and Bush have denied any involvement in Littwin's firing.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, the front-running Republican presidential
candidate, continued to defend his service as a fighter pilot in
the Air National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you what happened,'' he said Monday of how he wound
up in the Guard. ``Nothing happened. My Guard unit was looking for
pilots, and I flew for the Guard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of my service,'' Bush added, ``and any allegation
that my dad asked for special favors is simply not true. . . . I
didn't ask anybody to help get me to the Guard, either.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the elder Bush has said that Adger was a close
family friend but that the former president knew nothing about any
attempts by Adger to get the younger Bush into the Guard.
</P>
<P>
   The statement issued on Barnes' behalf said he called Brig. Gen.
James Rose, then the head of the Texas Air National Guard, and
recommended Bush for a pilot slot, which was available at the time.
Rose is now deceased.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, Barnes met with Midland oilman Don Evans,
chairman of Bush's re-election campaign and now finance chairman
for Bush's presidential bid, and told him about the efforts to get
Bush into the Guard. The statement issued Monday on Barnes' behalf
said Bush sent Barnes ``a note thanking him for his candor in
acknowledging that Barnes received no call from any member of the
Bush family.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes' statement was issued Monday after a deposition that
lasted more than five hours. Attorney Charles Burton, representing
Barnes, declined to say whether the Guard question came up during
the session at Barnes' downtown Austin office.
</P>
<P>
   But Littwin's lawyers, in court filings, have said it was among
the main lines of questioning they wanted to pursue with Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   In motions filed earlier this month, Barnes had claimed
``executive privilege'' protection against answering questions
about whether he helped Bush get into the Guard. Burton said no
objections were raised to questions asked Monday by Littwin's
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Burton said the deposition is covered by a judge's
confidentiality order and eventually could become public.
``However, that order does not prevent (Barnes) from setting the
media record straight on events occurring more than 30 years ago,''
the statement said.

 &HT;    NetSolve plans IPO for Wednesday
 &HT;    By Heather Cocks
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Amid a renewed flurry of initial public
offerings, another Austin company is planning to go public this
week, solidifying what has already been a record year for IPOs in
Austin.
</P>
<P>
   NetSolve Inc., which provides computer network management and
security services, is expected to raise $38.5 million in an IPO
planned for Wednesday, offering more than 3.5 million shares in the
$11- to $13-per-share range. The final price should be set today.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, another Austin company solidified its IPO plans on
Monday. Crossroads Systems Inc., which announced its IPO plans last
month, filed documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission
that sets its offering at 3.5 million shares priced between $11 and
$13 apiece. Crossroads Systems makes servers and systems aimed at
reducing congestion on computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   NetSolve will be Austin's seventh IPO in as many months, and
comes during a renewed interest in high-tech offerings _ despite
the fact that the stock market dropped precipitously last week.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the NetSolve, as many as 30 companies are planning
IPOS this week, which would make it the busiest week of the year
for IPOs. So far, the busiest week this year for initial sales was
the week of July 26, when 27 companies went public, said Rich
Peterson, spokesman for Thompson Financial Securities Data Co.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in planned offerings comes after a lull of a few
months for Internet IPOs, during which many companies postponed
sales rather than brave a lackluster market.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, 22 IPOs were postponed amid market volatility,
including Austin's Garden.com Inc. For the first time ever, four
Internet IPOs declined from their offer price by the close of trade
on their first day in August.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Austin companies have generally fared well with their
IPOs.
</P>
<P>
   Only one, Hoover's Inc. has seen its shares decline from their
offering price. Monday, Hoover's closed at $13 a share, down $1, or
7 percent, from its offering price.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Vignette Corp. _ the first Austin Internet company
to go public _ has been one of the most successful IPOs this year.
It s stock is up about 354 percent from its offering price, closing
Monday at $86.25.
</P>
<P>
   The continued strength of Internet and other high-tech IPOs will
depend on the strength of the broader market for Internet and
technology stocks, said Steven Disanctis, head of small-cap
research at Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the market holds up, then we can see a lot of these deals
get done . . . but it all depends,'' Disanctis said. ``If we see
poor performance by the overall equity market, by the overall
Internet stocks, then we may see a slowdown.''

AMERICA ONLINE UNIT TO REDUCE SUBSCRIPTION COSTS IN BRITAIN  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Hoping to stem its market slide in Britain, America
Online said Monday that it would lower the monthly cost of
subscribing to its service here.
</P>
<P>
   AOL will charge users one British penny a minute, or 1.65 cents,
in addition to the monthly subscription fee of (PS)9.99, or $16.45,
making it more competitive with Freeserve PLC, the British market
leader, which requires only the cost of a local phone call to
connect to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The move surprised some analysts because AOL U.K. had introduced
Netscape Online, a subscription-free service similar to Freeserve,
with considerable fanfare only a month ago. AOL U.K. is a unit of
AOL Europe, which in turn is a joint venture between America Online
and the German media conglomerate Bertelsmann.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the United States, where Internet access over a
telephone line is relatively inexpensive, access in Britain and
most of Continental Europe can seem prohibitive. Users pay by the
minute for local phone calls, in addition to the charge levied by
the Internet access provider.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, the cost can be high as 6.6 cents a minute during
peak hours, and range downward to 1.65 cents a minute at night or
on weekends. As a result, Internet services like Freeserve and its
imitators have emerged, luring customers by not charging a monthly
subscription fee for Internet access. These subscription-free
services make money by sharing a percentage of the revenue
generated by the cost of the user's phone call with the telephone
company.
</P>
<P>
   AOL U.K. users spend an average of 17 minutes a day on line
while users of America Online in the United States spend an hour a
day on line. Now, AOL hopes to increase its share of business by
keeping its metered charges on a par with those of its
free-subscription competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you make it cheap enough to use it all the time, people
will use it all the time,'' said Robert W. Pittman, the president
of America Online, in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said the new pricing system could cannibalize
subscribers from America Online's new sister brand, Netscape
Online. Bruce Kasrel of Forrester Research said, ``It undermines
Netscape Online, but they are willing to put Netscape Online on the
chopping block if it means all of the subscription-free services
are on the block with it.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL has traditionally relied on the monthly subscription model,
which tends to provide significantly higher profit margins than the
free-subscription model. As well as getting a part of local phone
charges, the free services depend on revenue from advertising and
electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Pittman maintained that America Online would not encroach on
Netscape Online's customers because, he said, the two brands
appealed to different segments of the market. Netscape Online, he
said, is for the budget user, while AOL's proprietary content
appeals to families.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts speculated that the move to what AOL U.K. labeled
``off-peak all the time'' would result in a surge of new
subscribers that might overwhelm the company's network, much as
happened in the United States in late 1996 and early 1997, when the
parent America Online introduced flat-rate pricing. But Pittman
said, ``I hope we've learned from our mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Noah Yasskin, an analyst at Jupiter Communications here,
predicted that as phone companies like British Telecommunications
moved toward flat-rate pricing for local calls, the war between
free-subscription Internet services and subscription-based services
would blur.
</P>
<P>
   Freeserve said on Monday that it would offer 10 free hours of
Internet access a month during off-peak hours if users placed a
certain total of calls with its partner, Energis PLC.
</P>
<P>
   Freeserve is expected to announce its first-quarter financial
results on Tuesday, and analysts expect its growth to have slowed
as a result of increased competition.

   Freeserve said on Monday that it would offer 10 free hours of
Internet access a month during off-peak hours if users placed a
certain total of calls with its partner, Energis PLC.
</P>
<P>
   Freeserve is expected to announce its first-quarter financial
results on Tuesday, and analysts expect its growth to have slowed
as a result of increased competition.

CRUISE LINES GETTING WIRED TO SATISFY PASSENGERS' E-MAIL
ADDICTION  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 3) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is not nearly as romantic as a message in a bottle, but
electronic mail is certainly a much faster and more efficient way
to communicate with friends and family back on shore from a ship at
sea. For example, passengers on the Norwegian Sky, the first ship
to offer 24-hour Internet access to passengers, were able to write
home instantly when the ship, on one of its first voyages, ran
aground in Canada last month.
</P>
<P>
   This inauspicious beginning for this new era of floating e-mail
access notwithstanding, nearly every other major cruise line is
also going full speed ahead to equip its ships with
Internet-connected computers.
</P>
<P>
   Shipboard Internet communications will not be ubiquitous for
several years, in part because it is expensive and complicated to
rewire existing ships, and in part because the companies want to
make sure that their systems are impervious to such potential
Internet problems as hackers, software viruses and pornography. But
within a few years, cruise industry executives say, Internet access
will be as common as satellite telephone access is today.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail aboard cruise ships is not new, but until 1997 it was
exclusively for the crew. (If passengers feel cut off from loved
ones during a one-week cruise, imagine how the crews feel when they
are at sea for six to eight months at a time.) Crystal Cruises, the
first line to offer a broad array of computer classes at sea,
started the trend in 1997 by allowing computer users to send and
receive e-mail at a few times of the day.
</P>
<P>
   As passengers grew more accustomed to having Internet access at
home, they began asking for full-time Internet access at sea as
well. Cruise passengers want to track and trade stocks on line. Or,
they have become attached to the instant gratification of e-mail,
which allows them to stay in touch with friends and family.
</P>
<P>
   Internet access from a ship at sea is accomplished via
satellite, just as ship-to-shore (and shore-to-ship) telephone
calls are made. A laptop or decktop computer aboard the ship is
connected to a local network that connects to a satellite
transceiver dish. The dish is pointed precisely at a communications
satellite, which is no trivial feat given the constant movement of
the ship. The satellite in turn relays the digital information to
ground stations called teleports, which in turn are connected to
the backbone of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The streams of digital bits going to and from the ship can take
many different forms, including e-mail, stock quotes and news
headlines, video clips, still pictures, electronic-commerce orders
and even voice.
</P>
<P>
   Voice is one of the more intriguing applications for maritime
Internet services. One principal advantage of Internet-based voice
calls over conventional land lines is cost, and the same is true
for voice calls made via Internet at sea. But while using voice
over the Internet will save the cruise lines a lot of money, it is
unclear whether those savings will be passed on to passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Making a satellite phone call typically costs $10 a minute or
more, or at least $600 an hour. The new Internet-enabled ships are
expected to charge about $30 an hour, or 50 cents a minute, for
surfing.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of instant e-mail is obvious, but the cruise
companies do not appear to be overly concerned that e-mail will cut
into their hugely profitable satellite phone business. As one
Norwegian Cruise Line official noted, passengers often use the
phone service to ask friends and relatives for their e-mail
addresses, or to call for help with a forgotten password.
</P>
<P>
   In the digital world, there is no practical difference between
sending a block of text, a picture, a fax document or a voice file.
Bits are bits. But to maximize their profits, the cruise ships
typically impose a surcharge depending on the type of message being
sent.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of revenue potential for the cruise line operators,
``It's like Disneyland with the doors closed,'' said Glenn
Farrington, chief executive officer and president of Digital Seas
International, the company that supplied Internet access to
Norwegian Cruise Lines. Digital Seas is also to be the Internet
service provider to a number of other cruise line companies.
</P>
<P>
   For passengers who do not already have a Web-based e-mail
account like those offered by America Online or Microsoft Hotmail
and who as a result must use the ship's Cruise Mail service, each
piece of e-mail sent costs an additional $5.95, and each video
message, consisting of 15 to 20 seconds of video, costs $9.95.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Passengers can receive e-mail, too. If they do not already have
an Internet e-mail account, they will be assigned one when they buy
their cruise passage, so that they can give it to friends, family
and colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   The same 50-cent-a-minute fee applies to Norwegian Sky
passengers connecting to the Internet from their cabins using their
own laptops. At least one ship plans to rent laptops for $30 a day.
</P>
<P>
   There are also surcharges for non-Internet applications. Each
time the passenger uses a word processing or spreadsheet program,
the ship charges $2.95. Each time the passenger plays a computer
game like Tiger Woods Golf or You Don't Know Jack, the fee is
$3.95.
</P>
<P>
   Although the technologies are most likely to be used initially
for simple communications like electronic mail, they could also be
used for more intensive applications like video conferencing and
electronic white boards for business meetings. Norwegian and other
lines say they will eventually offer passengers the ability to play
computer games against passengers on other ships.
</P>
<P>
   Even cruise lines wonder what would compel a passenger to book a
voyage and then spend hours cloistered in a cabin surfing the
Internet or competing in Quake death matches against passengers on
a rival cruise ship.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever concerns the cruise industry had that Internet access
might not be popular vanished within hours of the Norwegian Sky's
maiden voyage. The ship has lots of blond wood, a number of dining
spots including a Chinese-Italian restaurant called Ciao-Chow, a
cigar bar and a sizable health club. But the computers were a big
draw.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were three deep at the computer terminals in the
Internet Cafe on the Sky,'' Farrington said. The interest in
Internet access does not evaporate when the stock markets close.
``There's a really interesting group of users who show up at 2 or 3
in the morning, when their spouses are asleep,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (The grounding Sept. 24 forced the evacuation of 1,924
passengers and 787 crew members. The ship was scheduled to go into
dry dock last Wednesday in Quebec City to assess the damage; at
least one cruise had been canceled.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I rue the day that we finally put telephones in the cabins,''
said Tim Gallagher, vice president of public relations at Carnival
Cruise Lines in Miami, wistfully recalling when he could be aboard
a ship and the office could not reach him. ``I'm also not one who
wants to go see a movie on board. But my taste is not everybody
else's taste.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ships have evolved,'' Gallagher said. ``They have become
floating resorts. Our guests expect all the luxuries and amenities
they find in first-class resorts, and that includes instant access
to communications.'' Several Carnival ships now have Apple iMacs in
children's game areas; most already have Internet connections for
use by the crew. Internet access for passengers will be added
within a year, Gallagher said.

GOOD REVIEWS AFTER A BAD YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Shortstops are like groomsmen; the really good
ones give a lot of assistance and don't get much attention. So the
nicest compliment you can pay the Los Angeles Dodgers' Mark
Grudzielanek is to say you've hardly noticed his fielding this
season.
</P>
<P>
   His defense has been solid as the Dodgers' disappointing season
has been long.
</P>
<P>
   The error Grudzielanek committed Sunday against San Diego was
his 13th of the season. That's two fewer than perennial Gold Glove
winner Omar Vizquel of Cleveland and an immense improvement over
Grudzielanek's 33-error showing last year in 105 games with
Montreal and 51 with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   His offense, meantime, is as good as it ever was. Despite going
hitless in his last two games _ the first time he has failed on
consecutive days to get a hit since the first week of August _
Grudzielanek is batting .337 for September and .320 for the season.
</P>
<P>
   You have to go all the way back to 1963 to find a Dodger
shortstop who batted over .300. Maury Wills hit .302 that year, and
if you think that's neither here nor there, you've never been in an
arbitrator's lair.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball, as Grudzielanek discovered last year, is a team sport
until it comes time to calculate your worth. Then it's as cutthroat
an individual competition as the 100 meters. You're judged solely
on your numbers at the finish line and where you stand in relation
to your competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers took Grudzielanek to arbitration last year when the
two sides couldn't agree on a multi-year deal and it was a
miserable new experience for the fifth-year veteran.
</P>
<P>
   It was a performance review void of any pluses. Though he had
his agent in the room with him during the session, Grudzielanek,
29, felt like he was alone with his deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   As with any conscientious shortstop, he didn't like being caught
out of position like that. The pointed criticisms were hard to
handle. So last winter he worked with former Yankee Bucky Dent on
shoring up his defense. The results have been like a balm to the
Dodgers' infield.
</P>
<P>
   ``By him playing well, what it does is it prevents everybody
from any letdown,'' said Dodgers' first baseman Eric Karros,
suggesting that solid fielding isn't contagious but sloppy fielding
can be.
</P>
<P>
   The clubhouse culture rejects players who can accept a losing
season as long as their numbers are good. It would be like a relay
runner rejoicing over his career-best split after his team finished
out of the medals at the Olympics. It would be considered horribly
bad form.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek the baseball player can't feel good about about a
season ending on the short side of the playoffs. Grudzielanek the
businessman recognizes he has salvaged something valuable from the
wreckage. Namely, his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely disappointing we're not winning,''
Grudzielanek said. ``The satisfaction for myself is not as great as
it would be if the team was doing well. When all is said and done
you've got to take care of your role on the team individually and I
think I've done that.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Dodgers signed noted ground-ball pitcher Kevin Brown to
the richest contract in baseball, the pundits had a field day at
Grudzielanek's expense. Everybody was sure Brown would shrink the
6-foot-1 Grudzielanek to Eddie Gaedel's size with his glares.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were writing about how the Dodgers have that middle
infielder who makes mistakes,'' Grudzielanek said. ``That was fine.
I was making mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet he continued to believe in his fielding abilities even
if nobody else did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had the arm, I had the tools to play the position and
be one of the better shortstops in the league,'' Grudzielanek said.
``Most of the time when I made mistakes, it was a mental thing. I
just couldn't concentrate every pitch, every inning. I wanted to
come out this year and really make a statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek is an offseason neighbor of Dent's in South
Florida. The two played a couple of rounds of golf together last
winter and eventually got on the subject of fielding. Grudzielanek
said he could use some help, Dent told him about his fielding
school and next thing Grudzielanek knew, Dent was ``busting my
chops'' under the hot Florida sun.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek said he is indebted to Dent. ``He's been
instrumental in getting me straightened out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not an unassisted play by Dent. Grudzielanek deserves
credit for making a concerted effort to improve his defense. How
can the Dodgers not be gratified by the results?
</P>
<P>
   ``Just to get the belief of the pitchers, not have them be
afraid I'm out there, it's something I really worked hard on,''
Grudzielanek said.
</P>
<P>
   If Grudzielanek winds up back in arbitration, the numbers this
year will be on his side. ``I've built up a good argument, no
question,'' he said with a wary smile. ``We'll have to see how
things play out.''

CLINTON VISITS POOR SCHOOL TO VOICE EDUCATION THEME 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: La.) (nk) 
 By MARC LACEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ A week after the Sophie B. Wright Middle School
was labeled ``academically unacceptable,'' President Clinton used
the school's aging, overcrowded campus Monday as a backdrop for his
call for beefed-up education financing.
</P>
<P>
   The president criticized congressional Republicans for unveiling
a spending bill last week that would cut White House initiatives to
modernize school campuses, reduce class sizes and improve the
quality of teaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``The congressional majority in the other party in the House
unveiled an education budget that was $3 billion below what I asked
for: no money to finish hiring the 10,000 teachers, no money to
help modernize or build 6,000 schools,'' Clinton told several
hundred students and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the president, the Wright Middle School stood as an
example of the need for attention. The roof of the 87-year-old
school leaks when it rains. The average class size hovers at 32
students. And last week, Louisiana's first statewide performance
rating put Wright Middle and numerous other New Orleans schools
near the bottom academically.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte L. Matthew, the principal of Wright, said the problems
included pupils several grades behind in their reading levels and a
building rife with safety hazards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a leaky roof,'' Ms. Matthew said. ``We have ceiling
tiles falling. We have floor tiles buckling.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House said a House bill for labor, education, health
and human services programs would not do enough to improve such
needy schools. The spending bill provides no financing to reduce
class sizes and no guarantee that 30,000 teachers hired last year
can continue teaching. The Republican tax bill would modernize only
644 schools, vs. 6,000 in the president's plan, White House aides
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans maintain that their approach to education would
send money to local schools and not the Washington bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the grim status of Wright Middle School, which is named
after a New Orleans educator, the president found plenty to praise.
</P>
<P>
   He complimented the students on their school uniforms, a concept
he has been promoting in districts nationwide. He singled out a
young girl who scored in the 95th percentile on the science portion
of an achievement test. And he told students they could succeed
even in a less-than-ideal environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may have visited more schools than any president in
history,'' Clinton said. ``And I have never met a child that
couldn't learn or a school that couldn't do better and be turned
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides its need for attention, Wright Middle fit the
president's itinerary for another reason: It is just across the
street from Clinton's next stop.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton visited St. Elizabeth's Orphanage, now an art gallery,
to address a $2,500-a-person fund-raiser for Rep. William J.
Jefferson, a New Orleans Democrat who is seeking to become
Louisiana's first black governor.

   Legendary Opera House Rises Again in Spain &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After its opening in Barcelona in 1847, the Gran Teatre del
Liceu quickly became one of Europe's most highly regarded opera
houses. After it burned down in 1861, the handsome neo-classical
building was reconstructed, and its reputation continued to grow
until another fire destroyed it in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 11, the theater _ once again rebuilt _ will reopen with
a performance of Puccini's ``Turandot,'' starring Sharon Sweet,
Maria Bayo and Jan Blinkhof and conducted by the Gran Teatre del
Liceu's musical director, Bertrand de Billy.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999-2000 season, which runs through July, features
``Lohengrin,'' staged by Peter Konwitschny; ``The Marriage of
Figaro,'' staged by Robert Carsen; Verdi's ``Requiem'' and
orchestral music of Richard Wagner; recitals by Montserrat Caballe,
Marilyn Horne and Jane Eaglen; and performances by the Frankfurt
Ballet, Bolshoi Theater Ballet and Spain's Compania Nacional de
Danza.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was decided to update the theater and go beyond the demanding
task of recreating the original building _ with its Italian
Renaissance entrance hall, with blue silk-covered walls and marble
columns leading to the majestic curved staircase, and lavish
putti-filled murals. To preserve the auditorium's intimacy, its
former dimensions were kept, but the seating, acoustics and
lighting were greatly improved.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the 2,320 red-velvet seats with their elaborate
cast-iron bases now have better sightlines; a new foyer under the
stalls, with space for 800 people, allows dining during
intermissions. The building is accessible by wheelchair. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tickets for the Gran Teatre del Liceu, 51-59 La Rambla, (34-93)
417-00-60, range from $19 to $1,260.

   Samovars and Borscht: A Russian Star Returns &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If a restaurant can have a soul, the Russian Tea Room's must be
that of Rasputin. The jewel box on 57th Street has shrugged off
everything from Prohibition to nouvelle cuisine as New York City
has expanded and evolved around it for the better part of the
century. This month, after an extensive redesign by the new owner,
Warner LeRoy, who also owns Tavern on the Green, the restaurant
will open once again, with a modern Russian menu by Fabrice
Canelle, formerly of the Brasserie Savoy in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Although the entrance level is in the restaurant's famous
original style, replete with red leather banquettes, samovars and
perpetual Christmas ornaments dripping from the lights, as one
ascends, the fantasy quotient rises, too. On the second floor, upon
a jeweled base, there is a 15-foot revolving bear that functions as
an aquarium filled with sturgeon.
</P>
<P>
   The third story, with a double-height ceiling, has a ballroom
that continues the motif with glass bears etched on mirrors and
brass bears dangling from chandeliers. On the fourth floor there's
a diorama of pre-revolutionary Red Square in which special effects
depict the changing seasons, a moving river and tiny Russian troops
awaiting the czar. Throughout the restaurant, vodka will be
distributed from a 700-pound ice castle on a trolley.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant will serve updated traditional Russian dishes
such as Georgian spiced, seared cod, served with plum sauce, and
such Asian dishes as pelmeni, a dumpling filled with ground veal
and beef, onion, Dijon mustard, mint and cilantro. Dinner entrees
are $22 to $34, lunch $13 to $24.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Tea Room is at 150 West 57th Street. Reservations:

   Designer Show House Opens in Delaware &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Delaware's First Lady, Martha S. Carper, is helping preserve a
slice of Dover history. Under her guidance, Hall House will open
its doors and grounds Sunday as a designer showcase. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1886 by Thomas Wilson Jr., Hall House was purchased in
1983 as a guest annex to Woodburn, the governor's residence. Named
for Delaware's 46th governor, John Wood Hall, the 20-room Victorian
combines elements from several styles popular during that era
including Eastlake, Stick and Gothic. Victorian furnishings, from
the collections of the state's museums, will remain in place after
the show. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eleven Delaware design firms were chosen to refurbish the house
in styles consistent with the period. Richard Scott from J. Conn
Scott in Selbyville, for example, has selected a soft salmon-toned
Scalamandre damask fabric to cover the walls in the West Parlor.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Thomas from Little Creek Inn in Dover will incorporate
framed needlepoints, period portraits and pastoral tapestries along
with Jacobean furniture in a third-floor bedroom. In addition,
three local landscape designers are redoing the grounds in a
Victorian style. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hall House, at 181 Kings Highway, (302) 739-3610, will be open
daily through Oct. 31. Tickets: $12 in advance, $15 at the door.
Proceeds benefit the Boys and Girls Clubs of Delaware and Friends
of Woodburn, which oversees the restoration and upkeep of both Hall
House and Woodburn. A gift shop features the work of local artisans
and vendors. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   London Bans Cars On Some Soho Streets &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several streets in Soho, one of central London's busiest areas,
are now closed to traffic every afternoon and evening in a one-year
trial period. The plan, which includes new one-way traffic routes
and bicycle lanes, will be monitored, and the findings discussed at
the end of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Soho is a neighborhood of narrow streets with many restaurants,
bars and clubs as well as small shops, markets and media-industry
offices. It is bounded by Shaftesbury Avenue, home to many West End
theaters; Charing Cross Road, known for its bookshops; and Oxford
and Regent Streets, two of London's main shopping areas.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, drawn up by the Westminster City Council and Central
London Partnership, aims to reduce congestion in an area that has
become increasingly crowded. The street closings are from noon to 4
a.m. (to allow for deliveries) and include parts of Old Compton
Street and Frith Street, as well as Fareham, Moor and Soho Streets.
More street closings in Soho and around Regent Street are planned
for March.  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hotel Rooms Scarce for Sydney's Games &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you plan to attend the Olympic Games in Sydney in September
but have not yet ordered tickets, they are still likely to be
available, although the hardest to find are those for the opening
and closing ceremonies, diving, the basketball finals and certain
swimming and gymnastics events.
</P>
<P>
   Cartan Tours, the official United States agency, said that
Olympic committee rules decreed giving priority to those who
applied by April 30, then to those applying between May 1 and Sept.
15 and then to those who apply now through next Jan. 31. In all
cases, Cartan said, ticket distribution for particular events is
determined by a ``lottery'' _ a random selection by computer.
</P>
<P>
   If you do not have room reservations or family or friends in
Australia, do not be surprised if you wind up in anything from a
college dorm to a campground. But even that will be expensive, and
probably a long commute to the event.
</P>
<P>
   Although 11,000 new hotel rooms are expected to be ready by
September, including the new 417-room Westin Sydney, there will be
only 35,000 rooms for the expected 250,000-plus visitors. And 80
percent of those are reserved for Olympic officials and visitors on
packages that usually include games tickets, air fare and lodging.
The cheapest such package from Cartan, at $4,900, includes six
nights at a private home. Visitors who go on their own will be
lucky to find a room in a private house, and if they do, they can
expect to pay $1,800 to $2,500 a week.

WORLD WAR I CEMETERIES  
 AWAITING VAT REFUND  
 THE MILLENNIUM IN HONOLULU  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 3) 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Q. (italics) My husband and I plan to visit the World War I
battlefield graves in France of two relatives, one at the Ste.-Olle
British cemetery in Raillencourt, the other at the Bois-Carre
military cemetery in Haisnes. We hope to see both in one day and
then go to Scotland and Ireland. How can we get from one cemetery
to the other? What's the most direct way to go to Edinburgh? _
Diane S. Gaffney, Jackson Heights, N.Y.(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The cemeteries are 40 miles apart so they can, indeed, be
visited in a single day. One way to minimize the constraints of
timetables is to take a train to Arras and then rent a car to get
to the cemeteries, which are near the Belgian border. Leaving the
Gare du Nord in Paris at 7:22, 8:22 or 9:22 a.m., for example, it's
a journey of about 40 minutes to Arras. Avis, (800) 331-1084,
Budget, (800) 472-3325, and Hertz, (800) 654-3001, have branches in
or near the railroad station.
</P>
<P>
   If you want more frequent service, take the train to Lille;
Avis, Budget and Hertz have branches at one or both of the rail
stations there. The fares to Arras are $49 first class and $42
second class; to Lille they are $68 and $52.
</P>
<P>
   The Bois-Carre cemetery is near Haisnes, a village that remained
in German hands until the final advance, mostly by British units,
in 1918. Bois-Carre is about a mile and a quarter south of La
Bassee village. You can walk or reserve a taxi by calling Taxi
Allard, (33-3) 20.49.99.44. Many of the more than 200 soldiers
buried there were members of the 16th (Irish) Division. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To drive from Haisnes to Raillencourt, take the D947 to Lens,
then the A21 east to Henin-Beaumont, where you pick up the A1/E17
toward Paris. Get off at exit 8 and follow the signs to
Raillencourt. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you prefer public transport, you will have to go to La Bassee
train station and take the regional train to the Flandres Station
in Lille and change there for Cambrai. Raillencourt can also be
reached by bus from the Cambrai depot, 1 Rue Vauban. Information:
(33-3) 27.82.28.55. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Ste.-Olle cemetery is 500 yards south of the village of
Raillencourt, near the Chemin des Vignes. The village was liberated
by the Canadian Corps in the Battle of the Canal du Nord in 1918.
Most of the 97 Canadian soldiers with graves at the cemetery
belonged to the 116th Battalion. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From Raillencourt, it's a 45-minute drive to the Lille Europe
Station, where you can board a Eurostar train. It leaves for
Waterloo Station in London daily except Sunday at 10:12 a.m., 12:45
p.m. and 6:45 p.m. Travel time is two hours. The fare is $199 first
class, $129 second. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you continue by rail, remember that the train to Edinburgh
departs from Kings Cross Station. Rail Europe suggests allowing an
hour for transfer between the terminals. Information: (800)
438-7245 or www.raileurope.com. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first-class train fare to Edinburgh is $185 one way ($315
round trip); the standard-class fare is $130 one way ($185 round
trip). Travel time is four hours. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you would rather fly, British Airways, for example, has 12
flights a day on weekdays from Heathrow alone. The flight takes an
hour and the advance-purchase round-trip fare is as low as $77.
Information: (800) 247-9297.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Web sites that you may want to consult is that of the
Britain-based Commonwealth War Graves Commission, www.cwgc.org. It
lists the names and military units of the 1.7 million commonwealth
troops who died in the two world wars. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)In May on my way back from Charles de Gaulle Airport
in Paris, I stopped at the tax-free counter and handed over two
envelopes for purchases made in Paris and Florence. I am still
waiting for a refund, not knowing how to proceed. How long should
one wait? _ Milka S. Burstein, New Smyrna Beach, Fla. (end
italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The largest VAT refund service is Global Refund so chances
are that's the company that handled your paperwork. It is
affiliated with 130,000 stores in 25 countries. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you asked that your refund be credited to your charge card,
the entry on your monthly statement would read ``tax refund'' and
be followed by the name of country where the purchase was made.
Sometimes such entries are overlooked, according to Julia Ryan,
Global Refund's director of marketing for North America. In any
event, the refund should have shown up in two to three billing
cycles, she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are several ways to get in touch with Global Refund: Call
(800) 566-9828, the customer service line, and leave a message;
call (203) 674-8145 to speak to a representative; send a fax to
(203) 674-8709, or write to Global Refund, 707 Summer Street,
Stamford, Conn. 06901.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you made a purchase elsewhere, Global Refund may be able
to suggest where to turn for help. &QL;

   Q. (italics)We will be in Honolulu to celebrate the year 2000,
but cannot find information about festivities and programs. The
Hawaii Visitors Bureau Web site calendar.gohawaii.com, has nothing
about that period. We are interested in a public celebration, under
some official auspices, so it will not be too wild. Can you help? _
Joan Margol, Newport Beach, Calif.(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Like you, we struggled to find year-end events at that site.
An official of the Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau said that
after checking ``Oahu'' and ``all categories,'' users should enter
``millennium'' in the box labeled ``Title/Description.'' Or one can
click on ``Special Events.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the dawning of a millennium, one cannot expect calm to be
the order of the day _ or night. Among the quieter events will very
likely be Starlight MADDness, an alcohol-free event at Ala Moana
Beach Park from noon to midnight. Sponsored by Mothers Against
Drunk Driving, Hawaii, and the city and county of Honolulu, the
event will offer free entertainment, food booths and children's
activities and, at midnight, a pyrotechnic salute to 2000.
Admission is free. Information: (808) 532-6232.
</P>
<P>
   At the Aloha Tower Marketplace, a shopping-entertainment complex
on Honolulu harbor, the new year will be celebrated as it begins in
each of five time zones, starting with New York at 7 p.m. At
midnight, there will be a Grucci fireworks display. Information:
(808) 528-5700.
</P>
<P>
   A 10-minute drive away, there will be yet more fireworks at
midnight _ from barges off Waikiki Beach. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At major hotels, leading musicians and dancers will perform
contemporary and traditional Hawaiian works.

YEN POLICY STAYS THE SAME, JAPAN INSISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Japanese monetary officials have spent the last few days
trying to dispel the impression that they changed monetary policy
to weaken the yen as a result of foreign pressure at a weekend
meeting of rich industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts by the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance
came after the Group of Seven countries issued a surprisingly frank
statement Saturday night that they considered the yen's recent
strength undesirable.
</P>
<P>
   The statement from the meeting, which was held in Washington,
went further than financial markets had been expecting, and the yen
plunged in value against the dollar when markets reopened Monday on
speculation that central banks of the G-7 nations might act
together to weaken the Japanese currency.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently worried that the statement might have sent a wrong
signal about possible concessions, Japanese officials said Sunday
and Monday that they had made no policy changes.
</P>
<P>
   But the dollar, which hit a series of three-and-a-half-year lows
last week, still ended the day higher. In late New York trading,
the dollar cost 106.00 yen, up from 104.17 yen late Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The yen has risen over 15 percent in value in recent months on
evidence that Japan's long-stagnant economy is finally expanding.
But a stronger yen could threaten that recovery by making Japanese
exports more expensive, hurting sales and profits in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has said that Japan must take more aggressive
steps to weaken the currency, like expanding the supply of money in
the banking system _ a proposal the Japanese central bank rejected
last week. So the G-7 statement of unity concerning the yen
suggested that Japan had changed its position.
</P>
<P>
   As headlines around the world crowed that the bank had caved in
to pressure, Masaru Hayami, the bank's governor, hastily summoned
reporters to a news conference on Sunday in Washington, where he
told them they were misconstruing what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing has changed,'' he said in response to reports that the
bank planned to print yen to spark inflation; that it had declared
foreign-exchange rates would play a role in setting monetary
policy, and that it had otherwise amended its recent hard-line
opposition to further easing its already loose monetary stance.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when the statement Hayami issued at the G-7 meeting is
compared with the one issued after the bank's policy board met last
Tuesday and voted not to change monetary policy, it seems nothing
has shifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The distinctions in what the bank has been saying have been
lost in the very high level of politics between it and the Ministry
of Finance,'' said Jeffrey Young, an economist at Nikko Salomon
Smith Barney in Tokyo.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Washington, the bank said its policy of maintaining
short-term interest rates at zero percent has ensured enough
liquidity in the banking system _ the same thing it said last
Tuesday. It said it was concerned that the yen's rise might
negatively affect the Japanese economy _ which it also said last
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the bank said it would use what flexibility its
current monetary policy offers to respond to changes in the economy
and in the financial markets. Hayami made a similar statement at a
news conference last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   And the bank said it was considering how to change its money
market operations to increase the money supply, something it has
also previously said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that matters about that is by how much _ and
Hayami has never said how much,'' said a senior bank official here.
``I'm afraid the press has been fooled.''

<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Friday, Sept. 24,
about United Nations sanctions against Iraq misattributed the
accusation that the United Nations has taken most of the money from
Iraqi oil sales in the last three years and used it to subsidize
arms inspections and to compensate Kuwait for Iraq's invasion of
that country. The charge was made by Iraq's Foreign Minister,
Mohammed Said al-Sahaf, not by James P. Rubin, the spokesman for

FREELANCE WRITERS WIN APPEAL IN COPYRIGHT SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a copyright decision that establishes the new
rules of the electronic road, a federal appeals court in New York
ruled Monday that three major publishers cannot include the work of
freelance contributors in electronic databases without the
freelancers' permission.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous ruling by the three-judge panel in the 2nd U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a lower court ruling that had
agreed with the arguments of New York Times Co., Newsday Inc. and
Time Inc. Magazine Co. and their co-plaintiffs, University
Microfilms International and Mead Data Central Corp., the former
owner of the Lexis-Nexis databases.
</P>
<P>
   The publishers had argued that the electronic databases like
Nexis were analogous to anthologies or other ``collective works''
that can be revised without the permission of the individual
copyright holders. But the appeals panel held that ``the privilege
afforded authors of collective works'' under existing law ``does
not permit the publishers to license individually copyright works
for inclusion in the electronic databases.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, based on a suit by several freelancers, comes as
online publishing is exploding and as many publications are
expanding and leaning on freelance contributors to supplement the
work of their regular staff. It could force the companies to offer
retroactive electronic-rights payments for everything from opinion
pieces submitted for op-ed pages to full-length magazine pieces,
and for photographs and graphics. Alternatively, it could force the
publishers to go into their databases and pull out any freelance
work covered by the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Recent work, however, is less likely to be subject to the
ruling, since a number of media companies, including New York Times
Co., Newsday and Time Inc., have for several years required
freelance writers to sign contracts that allow electronic
republication of the work without additional compensation. Other
companies _ it is unclear how many _ have not, relying on contracts
that make no mention of electronic rights or handshake agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the decision on media companies could be
``devastating,'' said E. Leonard Rubin, a former general counsel at
Playboy Enterprises who now heads the intellectual property section
at the Chicago law firm of Gordon &AMP; Glickson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Publications that have hastened to take advantage of the
electronic age, and have an incredibly vast inventory of
interesting articles and works of fiction, and wanted to post them
on their Web sites and in databases for the sake of researchers,
are now going to have to go back to their databases and make
adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's going to be incredibly expensive and time-consuming,''
Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Judge Ralph Winter, writing for the three-judge panel that
made the ruling, held that ``there is no feature peculiar to the
databases at issue in this appeal that would cause us to view them
as `revisions.' Nexis is a database comprising thousands or
millions of individually retrievable articles taken from hundreds
or thousands of periodicals. It can hardly be deemed a `revision'
of each edition of every periodical that it contains.''
</P>
<P>
   While the case refers specifically to publication of material on
electronic databases, lawyers involved in the case said it would
almost certainly apply to publication of material on Web sites as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an issue of technology outpacing the law of
contracts,'' said Elizabeth McNamara, who specializes in copyright
law. ``Arguably, each individual freelancer will be able to go to
the publisher and say you've got to compensate me.''
</P>
<P>
   Opinions on copyright law from the 2nd Circuit, copyright
experts say, are given widespread deference around the country
since so many copyright cases are litigated here in the unofficial
capital of the media industry. Lawyers for the three publishers
said Monday that they were studying the decision and had not yet
decided whether to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   George Freeman, an assistant general counsel for New York Times
Co., said Monday, ``Certainly in the case of The New York Times,
our complete record is a historical archive. If one takes this
decision at its word it would seem to require, absent an agreement
with the freelancers, that we delete articles that were part of
that historical record.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``This opinion's effect appears to be tampering with
the historic record. That is very problematic.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Tasini, the president of the National Writers' Union
and the lead plaintiff in the case, was jubilant Monday at the
panel's decision to overturn the U.S. District Court ruling by
Judge Sonia Sotomayor. ``Every single data provider now is at risk.
We could go into court tomorrow if we wanted and ask to shut down
every database.''
</P>
<P>
   In letters the writers' union sent to 22 publishers Monday,
Tasini argued that the ruling ``potentially puts your company at
great financial and legal risk.'' But, the letter added, ``we want
to emphasize that neither the NWU nor the freelance writing
community is seeking to undermine the distribution of magazine and
newspaper articles via online networks.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the letter urged widespread adoption of a licensing
system that would allow publishers to obtain electronic rights to
works through the Publication Rights Clearinghouse, a group that
already handles licensing issues for some writers. The result,
Tasini said, would be a system analogous to that operating in the
music industry, in which organizations like BMI and ASCAP license
the use of music by anything from dance studios to high school
musical productions.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the American Society of Magazine Editors said
Monday that they had not had time to review the decision and could
not comment on it until they did. And lawyers for the publishers
pointed out that the appeals court sent the case back to the
District Court with orders to craft a final order. ``Of course as
you know we don't have an order yet, so we don't know the precise
contours of our obligations,'' said Robin Bierstedt, the deputy
general counsel at Time Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Felch, the lawyer for Tasini and the other writers,
disagreed, saying ``the opinion is the opinion,'' and the order
could not modify it, only follow it.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the lawyers involved in the case said, the decision
will give freelancers the ability to negotiate richer contracts. As
Rubin pointed out, since the Web knows no geography, electronic
rights are tantamount to worldwide rights. ``Worldwide rights
always cost more than domestic rights,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   But in practice, as Rubin and other experts noted, publishers
usually can set their own terms. ``If, in fact, many writers like
to think of themselves as starving, they'll capitulate to the new
terms. Important writers won't.'' Nonetheless, he believes that
publishers may well find themselves readjusting their contract
scales upward as a result of the decision.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Most publishers started selling their archives to databases like
Lexis-Nexis or Dow Jones Interactive in the early 1980s. Lexis and
Nexis were owned by Mead Data Central when the lawsuit was filed in
1993, but in 1995 were sold to Reed Elsevier PLC, a British-Dutch
conglomerate, which paid $1.5 billion for the electronic legal and
news retrieval business.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Tasini said in a telephone interview Monday, ``Way back when
this first started they should have been smart and come to writers
and asked permission. Now it's going to cost them more, because
they were arrogant and walked all over us and didn't bother to ask
permission.''
</P>
<P>
   But several lawyers for the publishers said that the statute of
limitations on copyright violation lasts only three years; if the
copyright violations were said to have occurred only when the
material was first put into a database, in many cases writers would
have lost their chance to file a complaint.

   ``Jus' da mostest hoss.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the way Will Harbut described the horse he groomed and
cared for _ the powerful Man o' War.
</P>
<P>
   Though the memory of Secretariat capping his 1973 Triple Crown
by 31 lengths in the Belmont remains with many of today's sports
fans, a horse racing magazine, ``The Blood-Horse'', recently listed
Man o' War the greatest horse to race in the 1900s.

   A remarkable career: 21 starts. Just one loss. But loads and
loads of controversy over it, and a term that entered into the
language forever.
</P>
<P>
   Man o' War was showing tremendous promise as a 2-year-old in
1919. With six easy victories in as many races, the
chestnut-colored colt was in upstate New York as the odds-on
favorite in Saratoga Race Course's Sanford Memorial Stakes for
2-year-olds on Aug. 13. So the track's racing office assigned ``Big
Red'' to carry 15 pounds more than his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Racetracks then had no starting gate. Horses were brought onto
the track and led behind a tape that was stretched across the
starting line.
</P>
<P>
   Their energy and anticipation often got the best of them. Horses
often false-started. The start of a race could be delayed by a
half-hour before the official starter could maintain order.
</P>
<P>
   But for reasons most historians have lost, Saratoga starter Mars
Cassidy was not on the job that day. A replacement _ a man in his
70s named Charles Pentingill _ tried to line up the field for a
start.
</P>
<P>
   Under jockey Johnny Loftus, Man o' War broke through the tape
early at least five times. An energetic horse rarely could be
backed up perfectly. His return trip consisted of alternating
sideways moves.
</P>
<P>
   And so it was with Man o' War _ sideways when Pentingill pulled
the tape. Since it was a 6-furlong sprint (three quarters of a
mile), there wasn't much ground for a horse to come back.
</P>
<P>
   But Loftus' ride was the next questionable move. He placed Man
o' War down by the rail behind a horse named Golden Broom to
apparently wait for an opening.
</P>
<P>
   In contact with the field at the top of the stretch, Loftus was
still looking for an opening. With just an eighth of a mile to go,
Loftus angled Man o' War off the rail.
</P>
<P>
   The rally was on. And down the stretch he came. Man o' War _
beaten. Second, by a half-length. To a horse named ... Upset.
</P>
<P>
   Horse racing's importance in that era of sports _ U.S. society
was yet to depend on the horseless carriage _ caused Man o' War's
loss to reverberate forever in the language.
</P>
<P>
   So the Jets beat the Colts 50 years later? It was an upset.
</P>
<P>
   Overconfidence may have done in the Colts. But what got the best
of the ``Big Red'' colt?
</P>
<P>
   The 15 extra pounds he had to carry? But Man o' War later
spotted rivals as much as 32 pounds and still won easily; he set
three world records and once won a race by 100 lengths.
</P>
<P>
   Pentingill, it turns out, was hardly a suitable replacement as a
starter. It once took him 40 tries _ a delay of an hour and a half
_ to get the horses started for the American Derby in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Did the jockeys fix the race? There was no official ruling, but
The Jockey Club later refused to license Loftus and Upset jockey
Willie Knapp, though both eventually were named to racing's Hall of
Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Man o' War's induction to the hall went without question. Even
with his Upset, he was ``jus' da mostest hoss.''

CAMPING ON AN ISLE OF MENACING MICE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 3) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BARBARA STRAUCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was near the end of our two-hour boat ride off the California
coast when we finally got our show.
</P>
<P>
   My daughter, Meryl, 11, and I were near the bow when she spotted
them _ off to the left _ not one, not two, but dozens of dolphins,
their sleek, gray-black bodies leaping out of the green ocean. They
jumped in pairs, in unison, playing in the wake. One cruised
alongside the boat in the full force of the foam _ getting a
massage? just showing off? Others pirouetted only feet away, so
close and so many it was thrilling.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're jumping really high,'' shouted Meryl over the boat
engine's roar. ``They're so cool!''
</P>
<P>
   Her delight, however, would not remain undiluted. My husband,
Richard, Meryl and my other daughter, Hayley, 14, and I were on our
way in July to spend two nights at one of the newest additions to
the National Park system, the campground on Santa Cruz Island in
the Channel Islands National Park. This family adventure proved
decidedly mixed, both glorious and _ at certain dicey moments _ a
bit grotesque.
</P>
<P>
   The first hint of the latter came just after our dolphin show
with the arrival of a park ranger, Derek. Our boat, the 65-foot
Vanguard, dropped anchor in the harbor and Derek paddled up in a
yellow kayak. With his long blond hair, shorts and sandals, Derek
looked suitably beachy. But after gathering would-be campers on the
deck, his message was tinged with grimness.
</P>
<P>
   First, he said, the island was still digging out from an El Nino
storm in 1997 that sent a four-foot wall of water and mud down the
canyon, destroying the campground and upending historic ranch
houses. We might, he said, ``see a lot of heavy equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   OK
</P>
<P>
   Second, to restore the island's ecosystem, the park service was
removing thousands of feral sheep, left from the days of ranching,
that were now wild and eating the island naked. So, he said, we
might hear a lot of helicopters dropping noise devices to scare
sheep into corrals.
</P>
<P>
   OK
</P>
<P>
   Third, he said, there were the deadly mice.
</P>
<P>
   Oh dear.
</P>
<P>
   With recent rainy winters and few predators on the island, the
deer mouse population, he said, had exploded. And many of the mice
were infected with sin nombre hantavirus, the same lethal virus
that in 1993 killed about two dozen people in the Four Corners area
of the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot emphasize enough,'' said Derek, his California-sunny
face in a stern frown, ``you must secure all your food _ away from
the mice. Once the sun goes down, the island belongs to the mice.''
</P>
<P>
   This was not absolutely news. Planning the trip beforehand, I'd
found local newspaper articles that mentioned the problem. The
campsite receipt from the park service said ``... bring own water
... pit toilets ... hantavirus in mice.'' But a park service worker
whom I had spoken to on the phone emphasized, as Derek later did,
that no one had ever been infected with the hantavirus on the
Channel Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I thought, every place has something wrong. At least there
were no bears. I wanted to camp on an island. How many mice could
there be?
</P>
<P>
   Besides, as Derek also told us, by way of a brighter
afterthought, ``you have come to a remarkable place.''
</P>
<P>
   The Channel Islands are, indeed, remarkable. Formed by volcanic
and plate tectonic activity beginning about 14 million years ago,
they rise in steep, sheer cliffs from the Pacific. They consist of
eight islands 11 to 60 miles offshore, between Santa Barbara and
San Diego. Growing up in California, I was well aware of one of the
islands, the populated Santa Catalina. But few Californians, myself
included, ever gave much thought to the others in the chain.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some have a rich history. One, San Nicolas, was the
setting for the popular children's book ``Island of the Blue
Dolphins'' by Scott O'Dell, based on the true story of a lone
Indian woman found on the island in 1853 living in a whale rib
house and wearing a cormorant feather dress.
</P>
<P>
   All the islands were inhabited by Chumash or Gabrielino Indians,
who fished, paddled canoes and traded with mainland Indians
starting about 13,000 years ago. A Spanish conquistador, Juan
Rodriguez Cabrillo, came across them in 1542; he died a few months
later when he fell off an island cliff.
</P>
<P>
   The islands passed through Spanish and Mexican ownership, then
to various private owners who engaged in a whole range of
activities from running hunting safaris (with imported wild pigs,
which remain on Santa Cruz), sheep and cattle ranches and wineries.
</P>
<P>
   The islands are rich scientifically, too. The rare blue whale
(the largest creature on earth with a heart the size of a
Volkswagen Beetle) feeds off its shores, as do sea lions and huge
elephant seals.
</P>
<P>
   Onshore, Darwin would have been happy. Because of their
isolation, the islands have endemic plants and animals that don't
exist anywhere else. The island fox is as small as a cat and the
island blue jay is huge compared to its mainland counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for a Channel Islands National Park came up in 1938
when President Franklin Delano Roosevelt proclaimed two islands,
Santa Barbara and Anacapa, national monuments. In 1980, Congress
designated five of the islands a national park and later protected
six miles of ocean surrounding each as a marine sanctuary. Then, in
1997, the park service acquired the last sliver of land it wanted,
our destination, the campground and old ranches on the east end of
Santa Cruz Island.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Of all the islands, Santa Cruz is perhaps the most romantic.
It's the largest, 22 miles long, four times the size of Manhattan.
Today, the western 90 percent is owned by the Nature Conservancy, a
private environmental group, while the rest is owned by the
National Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1800s, a Californian, Justinian Caire, developed a
nearly self-contained community with cattle ranching and wineries.
Later, there was a popular inn, and Hollywood used the island as a
backdrop in silent movies, including ``Adam and Eve'' in 1918 and
``Male and Female'' in 1919, starring a young Gloria Swanson.
</P>
<P>
   It's doubtful, however, that Miss Swanson ever had to contend
with what we found at Campsite No. 33 on Santa Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   It was a little past sundown when we saw the first one. After
hauling our gear a half-mile in Park Service wheelbarrows, we had
set up our tent in what we thought was a perfect spot, under a
stand of eucalyptus trees facing a stunning yellow-gold canyon with
clumps of green oaks and a crayon-blue sky.
</P>
<P>
   We spent the afternoon hiking along high white cliffs, walking
for hours without seeing anyone. It felt far away, like trekking
through Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   Later, after a pasta dinner, we were putting the food away when
Hayley said, ``There's a mouse!'' and then, ``There's another
one!''
</P>
<P>
   They were scurrying across a log. As I looked, more arrived _
not one, not two, but dozens. It was like some perverse inverse of
the dolphin show. All at once, tiny gray mice were everywhere,
under the picnic table, around the fire ring.
</P>
<P>
   Still, we thought, we're not ninnies; we can beat this. We put
the food in a strong bag in the tent, as the ranger had advised,
zipped the tent and lay back to go to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, we heard them. It was dark now and they were
rustling in the leaves, first a few feet from the tent, then
inches. Richard started making Alfred Hitchcock jokes; Hayley
thought they sounded cute. I was horrified.
</P>
<P>
   I had to concede my own wishful thinking. Before coming, hearing
about the mice, I thought they would be mostly in the fields,
perhaps a few around campsites, numbers we could avoid. But they
were everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the rest of the family fell asleep and it was only me
listening. The mice were getting bolder, flinging themselves at the
tent, then sliding down, making a terrible scratching sound. Deadly
mice were using my tent as a ski slope. I felt ill: I was a bad
mom.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, the moon was full and bright, and I glanced up at the
closed screen on the front of the tent. One big dark mouse, a
stalwart one that had made it to the top, slid all the way down the
netting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard,'' I said, jabbing my husband, ``I want to go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, of course, the sun came up. When we ventured out of
the tent, there were no mice, not a peep. An informal poll of the
few campers nearby found they had not had as much of a problem as
we did. They had heard mice, but none had used their tents as ski
jumps.
</P>
<P>
   We decided to go down to the pristine beach, where lone campers
and a family with small children were kayaking around sea caves. We
played and swam a bit in the clear, chilly water. We could see
giant kelp growing 35 feet below, and only yards away, around some
rocks, sea lions popped their heads up through a tangle of seaweed.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, we decided to move the tent to a campsite farther
into the canyon without as many logs. And on the second night,
there was, as far as we could tell, not one mouse.
</P>
<P>
   That second afternoon, we hiked up into the canyon, scrambling
over boulders, watching hawks circle, feeling better.
</P>
<P>
   The island at this time of year was sunbaked dry, its parched
hills covered with golden grass. Aside from the occasional oak or
eucalyptus, the yellow fields were broken only by rows of giant
coreopsis _ a five-foot-tall island version of the mainland plant _
that in spring produce brilliant flowers but in summer stand brown
and bare, like scraggly cactus. Near barren, the island had the
calming beauty of a desert.
</P>
<P>
   Since many of the animals are nocturnal, we saw no wild pigs or
foxes, but climbing the quiet, steep trails we'd often startle
quail. One morning, we watched, a bit sadly, as park workers and
dogs herded dozens of wild and frightened sheep onto trucks to be
taken off the island by barge.
</P>
<P>
   Later, back in New York, I found out that while we were on
vacation, the Channel Island mice had been the focus of a
mini-political dustup. When an Oxnard family returned from a visit
to Santa Rosa Island and reported that their 7-year-old son had
been playing with a mouse, which later tested positive for
hantavirus antibodies, a California Republican, Rep. Elton Gallegly
convened a hearing in late June before the House subcommittee on
National Parks and Public Lands asserting that notification was lax
for the more than 60,000 tourists who visit the islands each year.
</P>
<P>
   James Mills, chief of the medical ecology unit for special
pathogens branch at the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta, who participated in the hearings, said that
the situation was being taken seriously and that it had now been
decided, if funds were available, to start routinely sampling mouse
populations for the presence of the virus in a number of western
national parks. Mills said the National Park Service would also
increase education efforts.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But he, too, stressed that the disease is rare _ there have been
only 227 cases since it was identified in 1993, but 42 percent of
those ended in death _ and that there is a lower risk of infection
outdoors because wind dissipates the virus and sunlight deactivates
it.
</P>
<P>
   The virus, which can spread to people through bites or
feces-tainted dust, has been mostly found in western regions of the
nation, with its prevalence varying greatly from year to year. At
one point, as many as 70 percent of the mice on Santa Cruz were
found to have been infected, but now the exact prevalence in the
park is unknown. In the last couple of years, the park says, the
highest prevalence on any island was 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't hesitate to go to the park myself,'' Mills said.
``But you have to take certain precautions. Tell children that even
friendly deer mice can be dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Spears, a spokeswoman for the park, agreed, adding that
visitors have a chance to see an unusual and beautiful place.
``This is one of the least visited and most unique parks in the
system,'' she said. ``Here you have completely undisturbed islands
so near an area with thousands of people.''
</P>
<P>
   On the boat back to the mainland, those two sides of this
national treasure were aptly summed up. A middle-aged man from
Santa Barbara who had spent two days camping near us and showing
his niece how to kayak talked of what the Channel Islands offer.
``It is,'' he said, ``like California was 100 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' agreed a woman from Connecticut, sitting nearby who had
been to the island for the day, ``I loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' she said, turning to me, sitting on the deck with my
children. ``I hear they have a lot of mice _ and that virus. Don't
you have to worry about that?'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Far from the freeways &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Channel Islands National Park comprises five of the eight
California Channel Islands: San Miguel, Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz,
Anacapa and Santa Barbara. Information is available from the park's
Visitor Center, 1901 Spinnaker Drive, Ventura, Calif. 93001; (805)
658-5730, fax (805) 658-5799, and at www.nps.gov/chis. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Getting There &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Transportation to the islands, including for activities like
snorkeling and whale-watching, is provided year round by three
concessionaires, Island Packers, Truth Aquatics or Channel Island
Aviation.
</P>
<P>
   Island Packers, 1867 Spinnaker Drive, Ventura, Calif. 93001,
(805) 642-1393, fax (805) 642-6573, runs boats daily between
Ventura and the park islands. Each way, the trips take from an hour
to Anacapa to five hours to San Miguel. Round-trip fares are $37 to
$90; campers pay $54 to Santa Cruz, ages 12 and under $40.
</P>
<P>
   Truth Aquatics, Sea Landing, 301 West Cabrillo Boulevard, Santa
Barbara, Calif., 93101, (805) 963-3564, fax (805) 564-6754, charges
campers $60 ($45 for 12 and under) round trip to Santa Cruz. Among
other offerings, a three-day trip to Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa and San
Miguel, with dorm-style accommodations and food on the boat, costs
$393.
</P>
<P>
   Channel Island Aviation, 305 Durley Avenue, Camarillo, Calif.
93010, (805) 987-1301, fax (805) 987-8301, flies daily to Santa
Rosa and Santa Cruz. Day trips, including a tour with a park
ranger, are $98, $78 for ages 12 and under. Drop off and pick up of
campers is $150 a person. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Where to Camp &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Camping is permitted on all the park's islands. A year-round
primitive (no water, pit toilets) campground with 45 sites is
operated by the Park Service at Scorpion Ranch on Santa Cruz
Island. Camping on the islands require reservations from the Park
Service, $2.50 a night from (800) 365-2267, but there are no other
fees to visit the park.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About the Virus &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is a respiratory disease, for
which there is no cure, caused by sin nombre virus and carried by
the common deer mouse. Since it was identified in 1993, there have
been 227 reported cases nationwide, 42 percent of which ended in
death. The virus has been detected in 30 states, mostly in the
West.
</P>
<P>
   The Park Service says that mice infected with the hantavirus are
on Santa Cruz, San Miguel and Santa Rosa Islands in the park, but
none have been found on Anacapa or Santa Barbara. There have been
no human hantavirus infections linked to the Channel Islands.
</P>
<P>
   People become infected by breathing air contaminated by the
feces or urine of mice that carry the virus, being bitten by an
infected mouse, or ingesting food or water contaminated by the
urine or droppings of infected mice. The virus initially causes
flu-like symptoms, and eventually causes the lungs to fill with
liquid.
</P>
<P>
   If symptoms appear, you should seek medical help immediately.
The only treatment, according to the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, is to support a patient's respiration, with a
ventilator, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid infection, the Park Service recommends avoiding all
contact with rodents and burrows, using tents with floors to avoid
sleeping on bare ground, keeping food in rodent-proof containers,
and promptly discarding garbage in rodent-proof containers.

 By DAVID BARSTOW and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN c.1999 N.Y. Times News
Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Seeking to end a dispute with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
over a controversial art exhibition, the chairman of the Brooklyn
Museum of Art on Monday discussed with city officials the
possibility of removing the painting that had become the flashpoint
of the controversy _ a dung-stained portrait of the Virgin Mary.
</P>
<P>
   But after the officials disclosed the discussions to reporters,
other museum officials responded with dismay and the museum
chairman said on Monday night the exhibition would proceed as
planned.
</P>
<P>
   The development appeared to only deepen a battle that the mayor
has embraced with gusto and that on Monday spilled into his likely
Senate campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton, who was forced to
speak out on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever I discussed is now off the table,'' Robert S. Rubin,
chairman of the museum's board of trustees, said on Monday night,
clearly upset that word of his negotiations had been made public
before he had discussed them with other top museum officials.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday afternoon, City Hall officials told reporters that
Rubin had tentatively offered _ subject to approval from the museum
board _ a package of concessions aimed at overcoming Giuliani's
objections to the exhibition, and at ensuring continued public
funding to the museum.
</P>
<P>
   The package, city officials said, included removing the Virgin
Mary painting by the artist Chris Ofili, segregating five or six
other controversial works from the rest of the exhibition, and
accepting a 20 percent reduction in the city's subsidy to the
museum during the length of the show, which is scheduled to start
on Saturday and run through Jan. 9. The 20 percent reduction
corresponds to the amount of floor space the museum is devoting to
the exhibition, city officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this offer is true, it represents a major concession on the
part of the Brooklyn Museum, and a significant victory for Rudy
Giuliani,'' said Joseph J. Lhota, deputy mayor for operations, who
did not attend the meeting. ``On the money issue, in fact, if
that's true, it's important that taxpayer dollars will not be spent
on a painting which desecrates religion, plus other pieces of art
which glorify a child-murderer and the other stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin acknowledged discussing the three ideas with city
officials, but he vigorously disputed their characterization of the
talks, and he emphasized that he engaged in the negotiations on his
own initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am chairman of the museum, and I _ without authorization
from the board, or without discussion with the staff of the museum
_ did raise certain ideas, that if they were acceptable to the
city, I would attempt to get agreement of all the relevant
parties,'' he said. ``Several ideas were on the table without any
commitment on my part that they could be implemented.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said he had merely asked city officials to select one of
the three ideas as the basis for a possible compromise he would
then attempt to sell to his board. But the very fact that he was
discussing the removal or segregation of art works angered museum
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Lehman, the director of the museum, declined to comment
on Monday night, although several of his aides were stunned by word
of the negotiations and vehemently denied that the museum had
agreed to withdraw the Virgin Mary painting, which has been
condemned as blasphemous by several Catholic leaders in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not withdrawing any of the works in the exhibition,''
said Sally Williams, a spokeswoman for the museum. ``None of the
works are being withdrawn.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hillary Rodham Clinton joined on Monday in denouncing
Giuliani's threat to cut city financing to the museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our feelings of being offended should not lead to the
penalizing and shutting down of an entire museum,'' said Mrs.
Clinton, who is likely to run against Giuliani for U.S. Senate next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, appearing at a news conference in Harlem, added:
``I share the feeling that I know many New Yorkers have that there
are parts of this exhibition that would be deeply offensive. I
would not go to see this exhibition.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani seized on Mrs. Clinton's remarks, suggesting to
reporters that the first lady, who is Methodist, was countenancing
attacks on Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, then she agrees with using public funds to attack and
bash the Catholic religion,'' Giuliani said outside Hunter College
in Manhattan.``There is no way out of this. These public funds are
being used to aggressively bash the religious views of a
significant number of people in this city and state and country.
And the question is, can taxpayer dollars be used for this kind of
disgusting, anti-religious _ in some ways really aggressively
anti-religious _ kind of demonstration?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement on Monday, Rubin said that ``the ideals
of the institution are not on the bargaining table.'' But later, in
an interview, Rubin said he had indeed broached the possibility of
removing the painting, something other museum officials had vowed
for days would never happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the mayor had selected this painting by Chris Ofili as
the symbol of his disagreements with this exhibit, I felt that it
might be possible from his point of view that removing the symbol
of his disagreement with the museum might satisfy the city's
requirements to let us proceed with the exhibit,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting took place late Monday afternoon in the office of
Corporation Counsel Michael Hess. Also at the meeting was Schuyler
Chapin, commissioner of the city's Department of Cultural Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a meeting with Schuyler Chapin and Mr. Rubin, and we
discussed how to possibly resolve this dispute, and Mr. Rubin came
up with three separate ideas upon how to resolve this and I told
him that we would consider it if it was all three ideas,'' Hess
said. ``Not one, not two, but all three ideas. He said that was
okay and I discussed that with some of my staff and I came back to
him and said that those three ideas that he had come up with
together made up a proposal that I could live with. He said fine
and that he would take it back to his board members.''
</P>
<P>
   Hess added: ``I asked him, `Are you proposing A, B and C?' He
said yes, and I said I am telling my client about that.''
</P>
<P>
   According to city officials, if the museum board agreed to the
three provisions, Giuliani would then agree to abandon any efforts
to assume control of the board. The mayor would also end efforts to
cut all city funding to the museum, which this year amounts to
about $7 million a year toward operating expenses and another $20
million toward capital improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said city officials misinterpreted his remarks at the
meeting. He said he left without giving them a firm commitment to
make any recommendations to the museum board. ``What did I agree to
do when I left the meeting? I agreed that I would think about how I
could sell this to the relevant parties,'' he said, adding that ``I
have offered nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Stressing that ``each one of these three items was my idea,''
Rubin said he thought, ``based on my 40 years experience as an
investment banker,'' that one of them ``might fly'' with both the
mayor and the members of his board, who are scheduled to meet at
the museum on Tuesday at 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the discussions followed days of intense debate
throughout the city about freedom of expression and whether the
mayor has the right to withhold public funding from artistic
institutions that display art he finds offensive.

   RIMINI, Italy _ A two-year criminal investigation in Italy has
turned up evidence that alleged Russian organized-crime operators
have funneled millions of dollars through the Bank of New York in
what Italian prosecutors called a money-laundering scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Through an examination of bank records and telephone wiretaps,
investigators in this seaside town in northeastern Italy say they
have uncovered the first concrete examples of illicit funds moving
through a group of accounts at the Bank of New York that are under
investigation by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors here say criminal gangs were raising money in
Italy through a mixture of legitimate business activities as well
as extortion and tax fraud. The funds, investigators suspect, were
regularly routed to Moscow and New York, where, bank records show,
they were transferred to Italian bank accounts belonging to
suspected organized-crime operators.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must be assumed that part of large sums of money that have
been transferred into Italian bank accounts are the proceeds from
protection racketeering with regard to Russian businessmen,'' said
Daniele Barberini, an investigating magistrate here, in an arrest
order issued in February for the leader of the reputed Russian
crime gang.
</P>
<P>
   The case appears to involve small-time racketeers who allegedly
demanded payments from Russian traders in Italy who exported
consumer goods to Russia. Those payoffs, investigators believe,
went to the Bank of New York, passing through accounts of Benex
Corp. and winding up in Italian bank accounts belonging to
suspected organized-crime operators.
</P>
<P>
   Benex and a group of related accounts at the New York bank are
at the center of a federal money-laundering investigation. The
Benex network of accounts was the pipeline through which at least
$7.5 billion moved from Russia into the Bank of New York in the
last three years, according to the bank.
</P>
<P>
   So far there have been two arrests in Italy and international
arrest warrants have been issued for 10 more people.
</P>
<P>
   The examination uncovered three accounts in which money flowed
through the Bank of New York to bank accounts in Italy. In one
case, $5.5 million went from Benex to the Italian bank account of
Boris Rizner. Rizner, 34, is a Ukrainian and a reputed member of a
local gang for whom an arrest warrant for racketeering has been
issued in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   In another instance, Vladimir Zabolotsky, another alleged Moscow
gang member, had a bank account in Italy that received money from
the Benex and Torfinex Corp. accounts at the Bank of New York. An
international arrest warrant has been issued for him.
</P>
<P>
   Neither man could be reached for comment. The Bank of New York,
which is cooperating with the U.S. authorities, said it would have
no comment on the transactions.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation here was triggered in October 1997, when a
Russian businessman, Pavel Markovitsev, complained to the Italian
police of harassment by Russian and Ukrainian racketeers in Moscow
and in Italy, Barberini said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Markovitsev's testimony to the Italian investigators led to the
arrest in February of Yossif Roizis, a 52-year old native of
Ukraine and a naturalized U.S. citizen, who is considered by the
Italian officials to be the head of a crime gang operating in this
part of northeast Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Roizis faces trial on extortion, kidnapping and racketeering
charges. He could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The proceeds in this extortion racket, investigators said, were
considerable, but they could not specify an exact amount. Its
activities appear to have continued from the early 1990s until
1998, when it was effectively broken by the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Markovitsev was one of thousands of small-time businessmen who
began landing in towns around Rimini on Italy's eastern Adriatic
Sea coast for a mix of beach and business after the collapse of the
old Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   These small-time traders, armed with bundles of cash ranging
from several hundred dollars to $70,000, bought Italian consumer
goods with the intention of sending them back to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The region around Rimini is dotted with small family-run
companies that produce a range of goods, including apparel items
like shoes and hosiery, but also home furnishings and furniture.
The companies supply their products to big European name brands but
also sell goods under their own label through private channels.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the suppliers were known to the Russians from business
deals during the final years of the Soviet Union. And their
reputation for high quality at attractive prices lured Russian
importers here as demand for Western goods soared in the early
'90s.
</P>
<P>
   At its peak in the mid-1990s, Italian officials said, some
60,000 to 70,000 Russians were arriving at Rimini's tiny airport
each year. Today the international arrivals gate is marked in
Italian and Russian. Posters around the airport advertise, in
Russian, companies offering services for Russian businessmen
looking for Italian wholesalers. On the tarmac, Russian-built
Antonov cargo planes are often seen loading goods headed for
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   According to investigators, Roizis had grown powerful in the
Rimini area organizing the export of Italian consumer goods. His
legitimate businesses included trading in these goods, but he and
his associates boosted their income by offering to introduce
Russian traders to Italian manufacturers _ for a commission.
</P>
<P>
   Russians who refused to go along, like Markovitsev, soon found
themselves subjected to beatings and the tires of their cars were
slashed. Some were taken to local hotels, held for hours and
subjected to threats, a practice that qualifies under Italian law
as kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Another money-making ploy was to demand that the Russian
businessmen hand over the invoices for the Italian goods they
bought. Armed with these, the racketeers went to Italian tax
authorities and wangled reimbursement for the value-added tax that
the Russian businessmen had paid on the goods. Such levies are
routinely reimbursed to exporters who can prove the products were
not sold in Italy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Italian prosecutors have focused on twelve gang members,
thanks to telephone taps that were made possible by information
provided by Markovitsev.
</P>
<P>
   But before the arrests were ordered, investigators had set about
reviewing the bank accounts of the suspected mobsters.
</P>
<P>
   Barberini said that records of bank transactions between April
1997 and May 1998, brought to light numerous smaller transactions
that came out of the Bank of New York to Italy and that totaled
about $5.5 million. That included a series of transactions in which
about $700,000 was paid into an account at a local bank, the
Credito Cooperativo Ospedaletto, belonging to Rizner, an associate
of Roizis, the reputed gang leader who is under arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian investigators have been unable to trace the movement
of the money back beyond the Bank of New York, though Barberini
said he hoped the FBI would be able to help find out how the money
got to the bank and where it originated.
</P>
<P>
   His suspicion is that the proceeds from both the gang's
legitimate activities and its illegal ones were regularly
transferred to Moscow, from where it was laundered by passing
through the Benex accounts at the Bank of New York and returned to
the gang in Rimini. There the money was then used to buy fresh
Italian goods for sale in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In other transactions through the Bank of New York, over $1
million went into an account at a local branch of the Banco di Roma
in the name of Zabolotsky, another gang member, in the same period
of 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The money was traced back through the Bank of New York to
several companies in the United States, Barberini said, though the
largest amounts came from Benex and two related companies, Torfinex
Corp. of New York, and BECS International LLC, a New Jersey
corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Berlin, a Russian-born businessman, is suspected of having
control over the Benex accounts. He is also believed to have opened
at least one account at the Bank of New York on behalf of Torfinex,
a money-transfer firm that shared offices with Benex in New York.
Berlin is married to Lucy Edwards, a former Bank of New York vice
president who was dismissed after the federal investigation
surfaced last month. A lawyer for both of them said they had done
nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   BECS has been known to the FBI since 1998, when Russian
investigators asked it for help in tracing a $300,000 ransom
payment made to racketeers in Moscow for the release of a Russian
kidnapping victim.
</P>
<P>
   Italian investigators are continuing their inquiry and are now
looking into whether the Rimini gang's sources of income extend to
other illegal activities, like prostitution or trafficking in drugs
or arms.
</P>
<P>
   The suspected gang leader, Roizis, has been the subject of a
number of Italian investigations.
</P>
<P>
   As early as the 1980s Roizis had been detained in Italy on
suspicion of drug trafficking between Italy and the United States,
but he was released on bail by the Italians.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1995, in a raid that Italian investigators made on
Roizis' home in Fano, a resort south of Rimini, police seized
Roizis together with Monya Elson, the reputed head of a Russian
emigre crime gang in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Elson had earlier fled to Italy to hide out with Roizis after
narrowly surviving several unsuccessful attacks on his life,
including a 1993 shooting attack in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Elson, who is believed by the FBI to have close ties to another
Russian gangland figure, Semyon Mogilevich, was indicted in New
York on charges of masterminding a five-year reign of violence in
the United States that included at least three gangland murders
related to drug trafficking, racketeering and extortion. In an
interview in May 1998 with the Village Voice, Elson called himself
a ``partner'' of Mogilevich.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian police arrested Roizis and Elson on charges of money
laundering and smuggling jewelry in and out of Italy, but later
extradited Elson to the United States, where he is being held
pending trial on the racketeering and murder charges. Elson could
not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Roizis faces trial in Italy, on charges of money laundering and
smuggling. He may also stand trial separately for racketeering,
extortion, threats, and kidnapping of Russian businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   Barberini, the investigating magistrate, said Roizis had
occasionally cooperated with Italian investigators. Two years ago
he supplied information that led to the arrest of 13 Russian
mobsters operating in Italy, including Yuri Essin, a reputed
Russian gang leader, and an Italian businessman who was a former
executive of the large Italian oil company Eni, on charges of
racketeering and money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   But the Russians, including Essin, and the Italian executive
were acquitted when the wiretap evidence on which the case rested
was declared inadmissible.

METS' DIVE: HISTORIC (HYSTERIC?) PROPORTIONS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If squandering a one-game lead with five games to
play is considered a collapse and blowing a four-game lead in a
five-game span represents a collapse, the New York Mets would
appear to be the first team ever to suffer collapses in consecutive
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   It makes for a striking epitaph.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets aren't dead yet, are they? With six games to play,
they can still catch Cincinnati and win the wild-card spot in the
playoffs, can't they? Or is it Houston the Mets have to catch now
that the Reds have tied the Astros for first place in the National
League Central?
</P>
<P>
   Since the Mets can't control what the Reds and the Astros do in
the next six days, they have to attend to their own business.
Theirs will not be funny business. They play the Atlanta Braves the
next three nights.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves are the guys who began the Mets' problems, beating
them three times in Atlanta last week and sending them skidding
down a slippery slope that knocked them out of the NL East race.
The Braves have won the division championship, their eighth in
succession, and now can help determine which team they meet in the
first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   They did that last year, defeating the Mets in the final three
games of the season. The Braves didn't let down in that series
because they didn't want the Mets to be the wild-card team. They
don't want the Mets to be the wild-card team this year either. Poor
Mets.
</P>
<P>
   If the Mets are the wild-card team, the Braves can't play them
because the wild-card team can't play the champion of its own
division in the opening round. The Braves would have to play the
Arizona Diamondbacks or the Central Division winner.
</P>
<P>
   No one wants to play the Diamondbacks in the three-of-five-game
division series because Randy Johnson can dominate it. The Astros
can match the Braves' good starting pitchers with good pitchers of
their own. The Reds, as resourceful as they have been, would seem
to be the best match for the Braves. The Reds have the league's
best road record (49-27), but they lost all six games they played
in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Because they want to help determine their opponent next week,
the Braves are using their regular starting pitchers in this
series, Tom Glavine, Greg Maddux and Kevin Millwood. No break there
for the Mets, whose two-runs-a-game average in their six successive
losses represents their low point of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Cox, the Braves' manager, has another incentive for
keeping the Mets out of the playoffs. Like many managers, he
doesn't like his Mets counterpart, Bobby Valentine, and would be
delighted to help send him home for the winter.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds have been as remarkable as the Mets have been dreadful.
Two days ago they beat St. Louis, 7-5, with a 12th-inning three-run
home run. Monday they overcame a 6-1 deficit and beat the
Cardinals, 9-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys are playing relaxed, they're confident, they're
playing hard,'' Jack McKeon, the Reds' unlikely manager, said by
telephone from Cincinnati after the team's latest victory. ``We're
not thinking about anything but today. We're not thinking about the
Mets; we're not thinking about the Astros. Let the pressure be on
those guys. We weren't supposed to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   About a week and a half ago, McKeon expressed a ``gut feeling''
that the Reds would win the division title or beat the Mets for the
wild-card spot. The Mets thought his comments were good enough for
their bulletin board. So much for manufactured motivation.
</P>
<P>
   As well as McKeon has done in managing a low-payroll team to the
brink of the playoffs, his employer has not rewarded him with a
contract for next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they'll talk after Oct. 1,'' he said. ``I guess I
have to show them I can do a good job. I guess they're still
evaluating me.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the Mets' owners, in contrast, has said that no matter
how the Mets finish the season, their manager will be back next
year. Many people find it hard to believe that Valentine could
survive two consecutive collapses, but that's the word from Fred
Wilpon. Then again, if Valentine returns next year and manages at
least 135 games, he will move to No. 2 on the list of most games
managed without finishing in first place.
</P>
<P>
   And to think that the Mets went into their game in Atlanta a
week ago a mere game behind the Braves, and now the Braves come to
New York championship already in hand.
</P>
<P>
   If they do lose their chance to be the wild-card team, the Mets
will take their place alongside teams like the 1962 Los Angeles
Dodgers, the 1964 Philadelphia Phillies, the 1978 Boston Red Sox,
the 1987 Toronto Blue Jays and the 1995 California Angels.
</P>
<P>
   The '62 Dodgers had a four-game lead with seven games to play,
but the San Francisco Giants caught them when the Dodgers lost the
last four games. They also lost a three-game playoff to the Giants,
the pennant-deciding run scoring on a bases-loaded walk.
</P>
<P>
   The '64 Phillies led the N.L. by 6{ games with 12 to go but lost
10 in a row and the pennant. The '78 Red Sox squandered that
infamous 14-game lead over the Yankees and lost to the Yankees in a
one-game playoff for the division title.
</P>
<P>
   The '87 Blue Jays held a 3{-game lead with seven games to play
and lost all seven, including the last three to the Detroit Tigers,
who finished first.
</P>
<P>
   The '95 Angels forced a playoff for the division title by
winning their last five games, but that was after they had lost an
11-game lead they had in the second week of August.
</P>
<P>
   And now the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Corrections usually appear on page A2 of The New York Times, but
one correction would be more appropriately made here. Three weeks
ago in this space, it was written, with neither qualification nor
equivocation, ``The Mets will open one of two National League
division series four weeks from today.''
</P>
<P>
   The author of those words acknowledges the error.

AMID SWIRL OF DOUBT, METS HOPE FOR REDEMPTION
</HEADLINE>
   (With BBO-COLLAPSES, BBN-RHODEN-COLUMN) 
(nk) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In an attempt to break out of the slump that has sent
them plummeting in the standings and jeopardized their playoff
chances, the Mets have tried everything short of joining hands to
sing ``It's a Small World.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, for the good old days, one week ago, when the Mets were just
one game out of the division lead and had a firm four-game grip on
the wild-card slot.
</P>
<P>
   That was before a six-game losing streak squashed their chances
for the National League East title, made them the pursuers in the
wild-card race and raised the anxiety level around Manager Bobby
Valentine's dugout.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets can still qualify for the post-season, which begins
next week, but they need a quick turnaround beginning Tuesday night
at Shea Stadium in the opener of a three-game series against the
Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' three-game sweep in Atlanta last week put the Mets
in a spiral, which continued with three losses in Philadelphia over
the weekend. ``You'd like to think it's some kind of test and if we
can get through this, then there's some hope left,'' said Mike
Piazza, the Mets' catcher.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their alarming fall, the Mets do have a clear-cut recipe
for redemption. If they can win their final six games, they will be
guaranteed the wild-card spot. If they lose one or more, their fate
will depend on how Houston and Cincinnati perform in the final
week. If the Mets don't qualify, they will have collapsed in the
final weeks for the second straight season. They lost their final
five games of 1998 to miss the playoffs by a game.
</P>
<P>
   Even though they were idle Monday, the Mets lost ground as the
Reds beat St. Louis. Cincinnati is now tied with the Astros atop
the Central Division standing, with both teams holding a one and
one-half game lead over the Mets in the wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   The day off was a welcome respite for the Mets, according to
pitcher Rick Reed: ``I think getting away for one day is the best
medicine. I'm not even going to think about baseball. I'm not going
to watch SportsCenter. If you have to drive to upstate New York, do
that. Not to Cooperstown. Stay away from anything to do with
baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the losing streak started, the Mets have had two team
meetings, and Valentine has foreshadowed his firing. There has been
a lineup switch, a note of dissension from a veteran reliever, and
a complete collapse in the standing. A week ago, the Mets went to
Atlanta as energetic and frisky as puppies. And Atlanta essentially
rolled up a newspaper, whacked them on the snout, and sent them
whimpering away. They continued to cower against the Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Mets could slip into gear as quickly as they slid into
a funk, the mantra the Mets repeated all weekend. But that would
mean beating Tom Glavine, Greg Maddux and Kevin Millwood of the
Braves. In the six games they have faced those pitchers this
season, the Mets have won none, been shut out three times and have
scored a total of seven runs.
</P>
<P>
   Not one Met got a big hit in the last six days, and nobody came
close to hitting his batting average. The team left 21 men in
scoring position and struggled as much against journeymen like Joe
Grahe and Wayne Gomes of the Phillies as they did against Atlanta's
John Smoltz.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza hit .261 on the trip and he had two home runs against
Atlanta, but he did not drive in a run against the Phillies. Robin
Ventura hit an abysmal .150. Edgardo Alfonzo, who said he agreed
with Valentine's decision to drop him to the sixth spot in the
batting order, hit just .182.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine talked incessantly about the bad luck that seemed to
have enveloped the Mets and there were a few hits _ most notably
Benny Agbayani's hard liner Saturday with two on and two out, that
turned into a game ending double play _ that might have had a
better result.
</P>
<P>
   But bad luck doesn't account for Bobby Bonilla striking out with
the bases loaded in a monumental eighth inning against the Braves,
a matchup that Valentine had anticipated and desired. And it
certainly doesn't explain the week Rickey Henderson had.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson has been breathtaking this season, hitting over .300
and stealing 37 bases at age 40. But baseball has a way of evening
things out, and it leveled Henderson last week. In the first game
against Atlanta, he struck out with two on and two out to end the
Mets' best threat. In the final game against Philadelphia, with two
on and two out, he grounded into a double play to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine, looking worn and weary himself Sunday, said that his
team was exhausted and bereft of the energy it needed to spring it
from this rut.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm on the slopes, I say that fatigue makes cowards of
all of us,'' Valentine said. ``That's what mental fatigue is. You
can't concentrate enough because you're physically tired.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets get one break in that the Reds and Astros, each with
one loss fewer than the Mets, play each other twice in the next two
days. So if the Mets sweep the Braves and the Pittsburgh Pirates,
they're automatically in as the wild-card team.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because if either Houston or Cincinnati loses both games to
the other, it will have one more loss than the Mets _ provided New
York can run the table. And if the Reds and Astros were to split
their two games, and then win every other game they play, they
would end up in a three-way tie with the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   And a three-way tie is a godsend for the Mets. The Reds and
Astros would have a one-game playoff for the N.L. Central title,
with the results counting on the regular-season record. So the
loser would have one more defeat than the Mets, and New York would
automatically be the wild-card team.
</P>
<P>
   If there is anything more startling than the results of the last
week, it is the reaction it has flushed out in the clubhouse. The
players have remained preternaturally calm, as if they are
completely delusional or in denial. There is no panic and, at least
on the surface, just as little division.
</P>
<P>
   John Franco seemed perturbed that Valentine did not use him
instead of Dennis Cook to hold a lead against the Phillies, but he
was the only player who seemed anything other than frustrated and
perplexed by what has happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody is at the point where we don't think
we're going to make it the post-season,'' Ventura said. ``You play
the games just like you have before. When you've played this game
long enough, you've seen worse.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Braves here for a three-game series, the Mets may see
worse and pretty soon. The scenario this season is almost exactly
the same as last. The Mets set an undesired standard then, and have
only one week to avoid a repeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the only consolation is we have a little time left,''
Piazza said.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether that is a blessing or just an
extension of this curse.

ADVERTISING: GOOD, BAD AND UGLY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)  (mk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; NEW YORK _ Turn to the pages of the thesaurus where synonyms for
``sexist,'' ``demeaning'' and ``stereotype'' are found. Dust off
the airbrushes for obscuring or deleting gratuitous pulchritude and
smarmy double-entendres. And cue the CD of movie theme songs by
Ennio Morricone. It's time for another annual installment of what
are called the Good, the Bad and the Ugly Awards, meant to
encourage improvement in how women are portrayed in advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The awards, to be announced at a luncheon Tuesday at the New
York Hilton, are being presented for the third time by an
organization known as Advertising Women of New York. The effort
represents the first sustained attempt by women who work on Madison
Avenue to influence their colleagues to counter what the
organization calls ``the images we love to hate,'' among them ``the
babe, the superwoman, the be-bopping queen of everlasting
housework.'' &UR;  &LR;  The awards are also an effort by women in
advertising to offer ``attaboys'' _wait, better make that
``attagirls'' _ to marketers and agencies deemed to produce
campaigns that are more sensitive, inclusive and contemporary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judging by the entries submitted, the creative juices are
flowing in the right direction,'' said Jane Talcott, co-chairwoman
of the 1999 awards. ``But I would say we're not out of the woods
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be the media police,'' said Ms. Talcott, who
is also an executive vice president and creative director at the
New York office of Young &AMP; Rubicam Advertising. ``We simply want to
say that someone's watching _ and consumers are watching, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The latter point is underscored with the release Tuesday of a
study of 556 young women conducted on behalf of Advertising Women
of New York by Smart Girl Internette Inc. in New York. For
instance, when the respondents were asked whether they had ``ever
seen an ad that made you feel like you needed to go on a diet,'' 55
percent replied, ``Yes, I see them all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's frightening,'' said Ellen Flahive, president of
Advertising Women of New York, adding that the study ``points to
the power advertising has to influence young women.''
</P>
<P>
   And the respondents, ages 12 to 19, described 13 ways that ads
``insulted'' them, ranging from portraying women as if they ``only
care about their looks'' to depicting models as ``too skinny'' to
skewing camera angles to ``focus on sexy body parts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly there are marketers who are portraying women in a way
I'd like my son or daughter to see, but there's room for growth,''
said Ms. Flahive, who is also publisher of the American Park
Network in New York, a unit of Meredith &UR;  &LR; Corp.
</P>
<P>
   That seems clear from the ads declared ``bad'' by the judges, a
panel of 26 women that included an 18-year-old student in addition
to executives from agencies, consumer product companies and media
outlets.
</P>
<P>
   The award for a single ad considered negative, the Grand Bad, is
being given to the Frito-Lay unit of Pepsico Inc. and BBDO New
York, part of the BBDO Worldwide unit of Omnicom Group, for a
television commercial for a barbecue-flavored Doritos snack chip.
The spot showed a library packed with male students studying human
anatomy in the form of the model Ali Landry as she sashayed by in a
slinky dress.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Bad for a campaign will go to Victoria's Secret, a
unit of Intimate Brands, and Tarlow Advertising in New York, for a
series of commercials that depicted pouty models strutting and
fretting in particularly revealing lingerie.
</P>
<P>
   Other ads being singled out for condemnation include a Super
Bowl commercial for the World Wrestling Federation, created
in-house, which featured female characters behaving like, well,
wrestlers, and a spot for Anheuser-Busch by Leap Partnership in
Chicago, a unit of Leap Group, which showed a man expressing his
love for his special lady by calling her ``Michelob.''
</P>
<P>
   The award for a single ad judged to be positive, the Grand Good,
is being given to a commercial by the Chicago office of FCB
Worldwide, part of True North Communications, that brought together
Michael Jordan and the soccer star Mia Hamm to enact a modern-day
version of the Irving Berlin song ``Anything You Can Do I Can Do
Better.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Women's World Cup soccer tournament, which was won
by Ms. Hamm and the other members of the U.S. team, generated
several ads that were praised by the award judges.
</P>
<P>
   Among them were two commercials centered on the U.S. team done
for Nike Inc. by Wieden &AMP; Kennedy in Portland, Ore. The spots
carried the theme ``We will take on the world together,'' which was
exaggerated for comic effect; in one, a member of the team who
finds out from her dentist that she needs two fillings is joined by
her teammates who each proclaim, ``Then I will have two fillings.''
By the end, even the dentist's nurse-receptionist joins in.
</P>
<P>
   And the Grand Good for a campaign will go to the San Francisco
office of Leagas Delaney for four spots for Adidas, part of
Adidas-Salomon AG, which celebrated the players in the World Cup
tournament with humorous re-creations of their childhoods.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Apart from the awards ceremony and the release of the results of
the survey, the luncheon is also to include the showing of a
videotape from Leo She, a unit of Leo Burnett USA in Chicago _ part
of the Leo Burnett Co. unit of Leo Group _ that asked female
residents of Peoria, Ill., to respond to the judges' choices of
good, bad and ugly ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``They agreed on most counts, especially on the `goods,''' said
Denise Fedewa, vice president and planning director at Leo She,
``but they differed on some of the `uglies.'''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the New York women, Ms. Fedewa said, the Peoria women
``did not think it necessarily bad if the ads had strong sexual
aspects'' _ if the women were also ``portrayed as sexually
confident, using their sexuality as a source of power.''
</P>
<P>
   That was true, she added, even if, as in the Doritos commercial,
the models or actresses ``were in scanty clothes or bathing
suits.''
</P>
<P>
   So to advertisers asking the old vaudeville question, ``Will it
play in Peoria?'' the answer could be yes, if your female models
make up in self-confidence around men what they may lack in
clothing. &UR;  &LR;

HOW TO KEEP METS' SEASON IN PERSPECTIVE
</HEADLINE>
   (With BBO-COLLAPSES, BBN-METS) 
(nk) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fred and Judy Wilpon celebrated their 41st wedding
anniversary Monday. The Wilpons celebrated with a romantic dinner
and pleasant thoughts about all the beautiful things they shared: a
good marriage, a long marriage, three children and their
grandchildren. For at least an evening the Wilpons could put the
dismal events of the last week behind.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day Fred Wilpon, co-owner of the Mets with Nelson
Doubleday, conceded that he could not entirely stop thinking about
a disastrous stretch of six days that began last Tuesday in Atlanta
and ended, six consecutive losses later, in Philadelphia. The worst
was a devastating loss on Sunday that ended when Rickey Henderson
hit into a game-ending double play with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to sit here and tell you I didn't think about
it,'' Wilpon said. ``I thought about it all last night, in the
middle of the night. I replayed the game 100 times. But we'll get
up and play tomorrow. Yesterday is yesterday. Today is the
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   The lightning rod question is the fate of the Mets' manager,
Bobby Valentine. After the club's fifth consecutive loss on
Saturday, Valentine, in an emotional, unsolicited post-game
interview, said that if the Mets failed to make the playoffs he
should be removed as manager.
</P>
<P>
   For Valentine critics, the comment illustrated the manager's
fragility under pressure and a self-centeredness.
</P>
<P>
   For Valentine supporters _ and Wilpon says he is in this group _
the manager's comments underlined a deep emotional commitment to
his team, to winning and, yes, to pursuing a goal that has eluded
him for so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not just in this for the paycheck,'' Wilpon said. ``The
way Nelson and I judge personnel is on productivity and the way
people handle themselves. Bobby has executed his job beautifully.
He cannot hit, he cannot run. He managed them well. He's coach them
well and prepared them in every way. He's done a good job. A week
ago we wouldn't be having this conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside Shea Stadium Monday afternoon, a trickle of fans stood
at the ticket window to buy post-season tickets. Despite the recent
tumble the Mets are sold out for the first playoff game, if there
is one.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Meyers said he was keeping the faith, but barely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think at this point it's a bit of a long shot,'' he said.
Meyers blamed the Mets' tumult on Valentine. ``The players are
really struggling; they definitely look scared. But I think the
manager looks more scared than the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely seems that the manager has been panicking a
little bit also.''

<P>
   When Ben Crenshaw awoke Monday morning, the United States had
still won the Ryder Cup. Crenshaw, however, should be excused if he
pinched himself.
</P>
<P>
   So many visions will linger from Sunday. Who will forget
Crenshaw kissing the 17th green at The Country Club in celebration?
Or the normally placid David Duval pumping his fist, holding his
hand to his ear, urging the already delirious crowd to cheer
louder? Or the 45-foot birdie putt at No. 17 by Justin Leonard, a
putt that will be shown over and over into the next millennium?
</P>
<P>
   The Ryder Cup brings out the best in golfers. It moves them to
tears, unites them toward a common goal, and elevates their games
to heights that create compelling theater. The United States pulled
off the greatest comeback in Ryder Cup history, overcoming a 10-6
deficit to win by 14{-13{. A team that had been criticized for
being disjointed and underachieving rose to silence its critics
with each roar from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sick and tired of hearing everyone saying we weren't a
team,'' Duval, who made some poignant comments during the Saturday
night team meeting that helped galvanize the United States, said.
``I said: `I think we're better. Let's go show it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Duval and company did show it, and in a memorable way. Despite
the inspired nature of the victory, two hard facts also led to
Sunday's turnaround. The United States had the stronger and deeper
team. And in the singles format, when every player was forced to
stand alone, the Americans' edge in talent finally showed.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the matches that looked like mismatches on paper were
also mismatches on the course. As expected, Davis Love III beat
Jean Van de Velde, Phil Mickelson handled Jarmo Sandelin and Tiger
Woods beat Andrew Coltart. Van de Velde, Sandelin and Coltart had
been benched by the European captain, Mark James, until the
singles, and it was easy to see why. James knew his team wasn't as
deep as the United States' team all along, so he rode his top
players and tried to build a lead big enough to last during
Sunday's final round. It nearly worked.
</P>
<P>
   As dominant as the Americans were on Sunday, winning the
singles, 8{-3{, Europe still came within a half-point of retaining
the cup. Had the Europeans gotten just a half-point from Sergio
Garcia, Lee Westwood, Darren Clarke, Jesper Parnevik or Miguel
Angel Jimenez on Sunday, they would be celebrating instead of the
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, America's top players lifted a heavy burden, bringing
the United States its first Ryder Cup victory since 1993. It was
easy to gauge how badly the Americans wanted to win, not only by
how hard they played, but also by how hard they celebrated.
</P>
<P>
   No one should blame the Europeans for being angry about the
celebration scene on the 17th green after Leonard's putt. Jose
Maria Olazabal was still facing a birdie putt that would have kept
Europe's chances alive had he made it, and it was premature for the
players and the wives on the U.S. side to mob Leonard as if the cup
had already been won.
</P>
<P>
   But anyone with a pulse probably would have reacted the same
way. It was such an improbable putt, at such an opportune time,
that it was impossible for the Americans to hold their emotions in
check. The celebration had no impact on the outcome. But the
Europeans will certainly remember it, giving them even more
motivation for the 2001 Ryder Cup at The Belfry in England.
</P>
<P>
   No player is happier that the next Ryder Cup will be in England
than Colin Montgomerie, who showed not only talent, but heart,
playing superb golf while being rudely heckled by American fans.
The sooner that kind of behavior ceases, the better. Perhaps the
only drawback to golf's increasing popularity is that a few
ignorant fans have been drawn to the sport as well. Montgomerie
showed restraint by not reacting to most of the comments, but
Parnevik, who lives in Florida, could not believe some of the
things he heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of the American on the European team, and I had a lot
of friends in the crowd,'' Parnevik said. ``They were embarrassed
to hear some of the heckling that happened to Monte. I can
understand the Americans root for the Americans. But it should
never get personal, not in golf anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the actions of the minority did not spoil a
memorable weekend for the majority. And not only will the 1999
Ryder Cup be remembered as one of the greatest, but the year in
golf has been one of the greatest as well. All four majors had
riveting finishes.
</P>
<P>
   At the Masters, it was Olazabal, proving he was all the way back
from health problems that threatened his career, outlasting Greg
Norman, who showed resiliency by almost winning a tournament that
has caused him major heartbreak.
</P>
<P>
   At the U.S. Open, it was Payne Stewart making the putt of his
career to beat Mickelson, who played a brilliant tournament knowing
that his wife was due to deliver their first child.
</P>
<P>
   At the British Open, it was the incredible collapse by Van de
Velde at the 72nd hole, who tripled-bogeyed to set the stage for
Paul Lawrie's victory, yet handled a crushing defeat with grace and
humor.
</P>
<P>
   At the PGA Championship, it was the classic back-nine battle,
won by Woods, who continued to be the world's best player, over
Garcia, who is certainly the world's best teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   But the Ryder Cup may have topped them all. The Europeans may
grow tired of hearing and seeing Leonard's putt. But Leonard and
his teammates never will.

GRUPO MEXICO BID FOR ASARCO TOPS ITS RIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo.)  (lb)

<P>
   Asarco Inc. and Cyprus Amax Minerals Co. said Monday that they
would seek alternatives to their merger agreement of last July,
which could result in both companies being put on the auction
block.
</P>
<P>
   Phelps Dodge Corp., which has made a hostile bid now worth a
total of about $2.8 billion for Asarco and Cyprus Amax, and Grupo
Mexico, Mexico's largest copper producer, which offered to buy
Asarco for $1.03 billion in cash on Friday, are both pursuing
takeovers.
</P>
<P>
   Grupo Mexico, which was once part of Asarco and is its largest
shareholder with a 10 percent stake, has offered $26 a share in
cash for Asarco, only slightly more than Phelps' cash and stock
bid.
</P>
<P>
   Phelps has offered 0.288 Phelps share and $9 in cash for each
share of Asarco, or a total of $25.31 a share based on the $56.625
closing price of Phelps on Monday. Phelps shares rose $2.0625 on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Phelps has also made a bid of $6.89 and 0.22 share of its stock
for each share of Cyprus Amax, or a total of $19.35 a share based
on Monday's Phelps price.
</P>
<P>
   The offer by Phelps Dodge, based in Phoenix, amounted to a
premium of about 40 percent for the stocks of both companies at the
time of the bid.
</P>
<P>
   Asarco stock rose $3.375 Monday, closing at $26.9375, on the
expectation that higher bids were coming. Cyprus Amax stock rose
93.75 cents, closing at $19.5625. Grupo Mexico fell 0.1 peso, to
38.9 pesos, or $4.18.
</P>
<P>
   In statements on Monday, both Asarco and Cyprus Amax said that
their boards had authorized management to explore other options.
</P>
<P>
   Cyprus Amax, based in Englewood, Colo., said discussions were
under way on alternatives to the merger with Asarco and the offer
made by Phelps.
</P>
<P>
   It added that it ``could give no assurance that any transaction
would result from these efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Asarco, based in New York, said that its board had ``authorized
management to explore all available strategic alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   It said these included completing its merger with Cyprus Amax; a
merger with another company or reorganization; a purchase, sale or
transfer of assets; a tender or exchange offer, or a change in the
capitalization or dividend policy.
</P>
<P>
   A court in Wilmington, Del., ruled Monday that Phelps could not
require Asarco and Cyprus Amax to drop provisions in their merger
agreement that do not allow them to consider a new bid separately.
</P>
<P>
   Clarence Morrison, an analyst with Prudential Securities, said
Phelps Dodge might decide to make a direct bid for Cyprus Amax and
then pursue Asarco separately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phelps Dodge always had the best chance of gaining control''
until Grupo Mexico's offer for Asarco complicated matters, he said.

BAIL IS $5 MILLION IN KILLING OF BRIDE-TO-BE
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Agustin in 2nd graf cq.) 
(nk) 
 By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HACKENSACK, N.J. _ A prominent businessman charged with
murdering his former girlfriend on her wedding day was ordered held
on $5 million bail Monday.
</P>
<P>
   As sheriff's deputies escorted the suspect, Agustin Garcia, 47,
into court here, his friends and business clients in the
Dominican-American neighborhood of Washington Heights in Manhattan
said they were shocked at the charges against him. The authorities
say that on Sunday, he fatally shot the woman, Gladys Ricart, 39,
as she was about to marry another man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh God, oh man, I can't believe this, Agustin,'' Fernando
Mateo, a Dominican businessman in New York, said after he learned
of the charges in a call to the Dominican-American Chamber of
Commerce in Manhattan. ``I'm in a state of shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Mateo and others who have known Garcia for years said he
immigrated to the United States in poverty as a teen-ager and then
spent his adult life developing businesses that helped other
Dominican immigrants in New York City. He owns a multipurpose
service center called Ilusiono, in Washington Heights, that helps
Dominicans with taxes, legal problems, airline tickets and
immigration problems.
</P>
<P>
   The center was closed Monday. Some of the customers who stopped
by were in tears. ``I feel bad for this woman, but I'm crying for
Garcia,'' Dulce Minior, 49, said.
</P>
<P>
   Ana Pagan, 23, said: ``I'm shocked and very depressed. I believe
that everyone who knows him here feels that way. He's a decent,
hard-working, honest man.''
</P>
<P>
   Early this decade, Garcia, of North Bergen, N.J., served on a
committee that advised New York Gov. Mario M. Cuomo on relations
with Dominican residents. He is executive vice president of the
Dominican Associations, a nonprofit center in Manhattan that
provides immigrants with computer training and English-language
instruction. He is also president of the Dominican-American Chamber
of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a hard-working, amicable guy with lots of energy,'' said
Apolinar Trinidad, who served on the Cuomo advisory board with
Garcia. ``There was no indication he had any personal problems or
that he would react violently like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Until early this year, he and Ms. Ricart were fixtures at social
and political gatherings in Washington Heights, friends said. They
apparently began their relationship in the late 1980s or early
1990s, after he was divorced and began raising his children, a
daughter, now 19, and a son, 15, as a single parent, friends said.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, Ms. Ricart, an accountant at a Manhattan travel
agency, broke off their relationship and began seeing a Brooklyn
man, James L. Preston, 36. They were to be married on Sunday in
Queens. Ms. Ricart, her bridal party and family members were
minutes away from leaving her home in Ridgefield, N.J., when Garcia
arrived at the house uninvited. He entered the living room as Ms.
Ricart was posing for pictures in her wedding gown, took a
.38-caliber pistol from a leather bag he was carrying or from a
pocket in his suit and fired two shots at Ms. Ricart, an assistant
prosecutor, James V. Santulli, said Monday in court. Santulli said
the authorities believe that both shots hit her.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ricart's brother, Juan, began grappling with Garcia,
Santulli said. As they struggled, three more shots were fired, and
the authorities believe that one of those bullets also hit Ms.
Ricart, he said.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy showed that bullets struck Ms. Ricart in the right
arm, back and head, and she died instantly, Santulli said.
</P>
<P>
   During Garcia's court appearance, Santulli told Judge William C.
Meehan that the prosecutor's office was considering seeking the
death penalty. Santulli said the suspect had stormed into Ms.
Ricart's home and started shooting in a room full of adults and
children. ``This was a person who was out to kill the victim,''
Santulli said.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia's lawyer, Fernando Oliver, said that his client did not
intentionally shoot Ms. Ricart. Oliver said that the shots were
fired after Garcia and Ms. Ricart's brother began struggling and
said, without elaboration, that ``certainly some self-defense
issues are involved.''
</P>
<P>
   As he granted Santulli's request for bail of $5 million, Meehan
called the shooting a ``horrendous event.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This should have been one of the happiest days of her life.
Instead, it was the last day of her life,'' he said.

SEWAGE POLLUTION TAINTS PARADISE IN FLORIDA KEYS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   KEY WEST, Fla. _ For a minute or two, as the tall, tanned,
beautiful woman from Norway splashed and laughed in the shallows,
it was just another picture-postcard moment in the blue-green
waters of Key West.
</P>
<P>
   The vacationing Norwegian, Linda Eng, had not seen the signs on
George Smathers Beach that warned that this water she was wading in
was swimming with potentially deadly bacteria, and she was still
flashing a 60-watt smile when a passerby told her that the placid,
inviting water was contaminated.
</P>
<P>
   ``With what?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Human feces, she was told.
</P>
<P>
   Her smile turned upside down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to take a shower now,'' she said, looking stricken.
</P>
<P>
   Signs warning of that hazard have been posted most of the summer
on beaches on this coral rock island of Key West, perhaps the most
storied and romantic tropical hideaway in the eastern United
States. Earlier this month, health officials posted more signs on
beaches on Marathon and Tavernier Keys, after water there showed
fecal contamination.
</P>
<P>
   In Key West, antiquated, leaking sewage lines are allowing raw
sewage to seep into the shallows, and work crews are tearing up
streets all over the city to repair the sewer system, a project
that the state _ even before this crisis _ordered the city to
complete by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   State health officials are still trying to determine why the
human waste showed up in the Upper Keys off Marathon and Tavernier,
closer to the Florida peninsula. Probably, Keys residents reason,
it is coming from old septic tanks and sewer lines there, too,
overwhelmed by overdevelopment, and never compatible with the high
water table and porous limestone ground in the first place. It is a
serious health risk. E. coli bacteria, found in human waste, can
kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young children and the elderly are at the most risk,'' said
Stephanie Walters, administrator for the Monroe County Health
Department, ``especially children, because they tend to drink the
water while they are swimming.'' The bacteria in the water can
cause nausea, diarrhea, ear and eye infections and respiratory
illness, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The contamination has had only a minor impact on tourism _ in
part because vacationers usually learn about the hazard only after
they have arrived, in part because most people who come to Key West
are more interested in diving in cleaner reef waters offshore _ but
the hazard has prompted some to cut vacations short, hotel managers
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come all this way, just to find a sign on the beach with
a skull and crossbones,'' said Carl Hiaasen, the best-selling
novelist whose books on South Florida, beginning with ``Tourist
Season'' and, more recently, ``Lucky You,'' have harpooned
politicians and developers for their ruination of Florida's
ecology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time a toilet is flushed in the Keys, these E. coli
paddle out on their little surfboards,'' said Hiaasen, who lives in
Islamorada in the Upper Keys and writes a popular, politically
acerbic column for The Miami Herald. ``We're poisoning it,'' he
added, more seriously. ``It's heartbreaking.''
</P>
<P>
   A survey by the Key West Hotel and Motel Association, expected
soon, will determine how much contaminated beaches are costing the
Keys in tourism dollars, said Jack Smith, the association's
executive vice president. But more than money is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the thing that kills the Keys if we don't do
something about it,'' said Nora Williams, the Monroe County
commissioner who called for water testing earlier this year. She
did that, she said, because the water looked dirty, something other
Keys residents have noticed with increasing dismay. Water is what
lures people here, to live or to play.
</P>
<P>
   Although the city of Key West has an airport that can handle
commercial jets, many people choose to drive down from Miami,
across a connect-the-dots highway of bridges, more than 120 miles
in all, that link the island chain with the rest of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Look to the west, driving from the peninsula to Key West on
Route 1, and small, green islands stretch across the shallows
toward Florida Bay and the Gulf of Mexico. Look to the east, and
the Atlantic shimmers blue toward a seemingly endless horizon, but
with Cuba just 100 miles away. Some islands are barely wider than
the road, with just enough room between asphalt and open water for
tiki bars, charter-boat businesses and, of course, real estate
offices.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to believe, floating in such beauty, that it is still
paradise, residents here say, but for a long time, it has been
changing. Route 1 creeps with bumper-to-bumper traffic, even on a
weekday afternoon, the convertibles and rental mini-vans of
tourists sandwiched by trucks hauling mobile homes and concrete. At
night, on Marathon Key, it is possible to hear the electricity hiss
and buzz through the power lines as it travels from the peninsula
to the bars on Key West's Duval Street, where the venerable Sloppy
Joe's, where Ernest Hemingway drank, now shares the street with the
Hard Rock Cafe and Planet Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Bureau of Economic and Business Research at the
University of Florida, the 1990 population of Monroe County, which
includes the Keys, was 78,000 people, and environmental groups were
screaming that the chain of islands, with so little dry ground, was
overdeveloped. In 1998, the population of the islands had swelled
to 85,646.
</P>
<P>
   In April, there were 27,698 people living in Key West, compared
with 24,832 in 1990. But in Key West alone, more than 18,600
visitors a day, on average, fill the island, according to the Key
West Planning Department.
</P>
<P>
   To see the impact, just stroll to any canal. ``In the past
couple of years, I've seen largely reduced visibility and increased
murkiness,'' said Ms. Williams. ``Most visitors would not notice it
_ people thought it was so clean they could drink from it _ but it
has become pretty noticeable to natives and residents.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Key West City Commission voted unanimously last week to put
a bond referendum on the Nov. 2 ballot, asking voters to decide if
the city should borrow up to $23 million to accelerate work on the
sewer lines and upgrade the city's sewage treatment plant.
Elsewhere in the Keys, county officials have a block-by-block plan
to repair damaged and obsolete sewage systems, said Jack Teague,
environmental administrator for Monroe County.
</P>
<P>
   What is really needed is a new waste-water treatment plant for
the Upper Keys, some residents and environmental groups say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mother Nature is saying, `Enough is enough,''' said Lynne
Cameron, who heads a privately financed social service agency in
Miami, but lives part of the week in Tavernier.
</P>
<P>
   Fran Decker, who lives in Marathon and heads the local advisory
council to the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, has seen the
canal behind her home grow murky, and the fish and lobster
populations there have dwindled. ``I feel like many people were in
denial,'' Ms. Decker said. ``They didn't feel like it could happen
here. It kind of contradicts what the Keys are about.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It only became a real issue, said Hiaasen and others who live
here, when it became an economic one. ``The sad truth is, this had
been around for a long time,'' Hiaasen said. ``They only just
started testing for it. Some people were actually upset that the
news was published before Labor Day. God forbid we should warn
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   But even then, city and tourism officials have put a positive
spin on it. ``I've read that the beaches here are closed, but none
of the beaches are closed,'' said Smith, of the Key West Hotel and
Motel Association. Sunbathing, he said, is perfectly safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' he added, ``going in the water is another story.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoteliers are taking the threat seriously, posting the warning
at front desks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had our grim days this year,'' with cancellations, said
Mike Proimos, general manager of the Marriott Casa Marina Resort in
Key West. But like many others here, he points out that Key West
has much more to offer than beaches.
</P>
<P>
   Diving trips to the coral reef that runs alongside Key West have
been mostly unaffected, because that water is not tainted with the
feces, and the Key West bars _ the real reason many people come
here _ are still open. Like New Orleans, Key West is one of those
cities where it is common, if not acceptable, for people to be
dog-drunk at 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come down here because they like the atmosphere, the
landscape, the partying,'' Marshall of Sloppy Joe's said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would still go swimming. It wouldn't bother me,'' he said.
``You don't see raw sewage floating around beside you or
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   At night, people still gather to watch the sunset, drinks in
hand. But Smathers Beach was recently deserted, except for a
middle-aged couple who were very careful not to get their feet wet.

PHILIP MORRIS LINKED TO GROUP THAT PAID FOR GOVERNOR'S TRIPS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Four years ago, Gov. George Pataki took a widely
publicized trip to Hungary to promote trade and trace his roots in
the homeland of his paternal grandparents. Newly elected, the
governor cut a triumphant swath through the country, meeting
political leaders in Budapest and distant cousins in ancestral
villages. A year later, he visited again.
</P>
<P>
   The governor emphasized at the time that the trips did not cost
the taxpayers a cent. A nonprofit group called the
Hungarian-American Chamber of Commerce of New York and New Jersey
agreed to shoulder the costs for him and a handful of family
members and aides, and Pataki dismissed criticism about accepting
such a gift by asserting that the chamber had no business before
the state. A state ethics panel, working with information from the
governor, concurred and gave its blessing.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, though, never learned that before the trips, the
chamber had gained a benefactor: Philip Morris, the cigarette
giant, which has long been a powerful lobbying force in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   A week before the first trip in September 1995, the company
contributed $10,000 to the chamber, having never given to the
3-year-old group before, according to Philip Morris. A few weeks
before the second trip in October 1996, the company contributed
$10,000 more, and it gave another $10,000 a year later.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Philip Morris sent a senior executive who was
overseeing the lobbying of New York and other state governments to
attend a dinner for Pataki in Budapest on the 1995 trip.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki declined to be interviewed for this article. His press
secretary, Michael McKeon, said the governor and his aides were not
aware of the donations and had not asked the chamber about its
backers. ``Did we know about the chamber's fund-raising or who was
giving?'' McKeon said. ``An emphatic no.''
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the trips has never been made public. McKeon said
the governor would not disclose how much the chamber paid and would
not ask the chamber to make its finances public. He said Pataki and
his aides had not helped the chamber raise money and had strictly
adhered to the ethics rules.
</P>
<P>
   The chamber would not discuss its finances, the cost of the
trips or whether the Philip Morris money had been spent on them.
But the group's tax records show that it financed few other major
events or functions in those years and that Philip Morris' $30,000
in donations amounted to nearly 30 percent of the chamber's entire
revenues in that period.
</P>
<P>
   The tax records also show that the chamber was spending nearly
everything that it took in: After receiving the $30,000 and paying
for the trips and other expenses, the chamber had $543 in the bank
at the end of its fiscal year on Sept. 30, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The donations would be in violation of the ethics rules if it
could be shown that they were linked to the trips. A spokeswoman
for Philip Morris, Tara Carraro, said the company did not give the
donations to underwrite the trips, adding that it routinely
contributed to such trade groups.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carraro said she did not believe that the company had taken
part in any other chamber functions besides the 1995 dinner in
Budapest.
</P>
<P>
   While the state Ethics Commission permitted the trips, one of
the members who voted on it said after being told of the Philip
Morris donations that they were troubling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ethics Commission should at least go back and see if
having known that, they would have voted differently,'' said the
member, the Rev. Robert E. Eggenschiller, a Republican who was on
the panel from 1992 to 1997. ``Why was there this sudden infusion
of cash? What was the purpose? Were they just being generous? Or
was there some ulterior purpose? Were they, in a sense, lobbying?''
</P>
<P>
   The ethics rules prohibit administration officials from
accepting gifts of $75 or more from companies with business before
the state. The rules also bar officials from directing that a
nonprofit group receive a gift that they cannot legally accept. A
separate state law requires that companies disclose all spending on
lobbying of state officials, including funds funneled through third
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris, the maker of Marlboro and other cigarettes, has
vigorously opposed anti-smoking measures in Albany, and some health
groups contend that its lobbying explains why New York's
anti-smoking programs and laws lag behind those in some other big
states. In July, The New York Times reported that from 1993 to
1996, at least 115 members in the 211-member State Legislature had
accepted gifts from the company, including meals at expensive
restaurants and tickets to sporting and cultural events.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, in response to a state inquiry prompted by
the Times article, the company acknowledged that it had not
disclosed all its spending on lobbying the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carraro, the Philip Morris spokeswoman, said the donations
to the chamber did not violate any ethics or lobbying rules because
they were unrelated to the company's activities in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the governor's trips, Philip Morris was trying to
win passage of sweeping measures in Albany that would have repealed
smoking restrictions in New York City and other localities,
replacing them with weaker statewide rules.
</P>
<P>
   The less restrictive statewide measures generally had the
support of Pataki, a Republican, and Republican lawmakers, who have
maintained good relations with the tobacco industry. In the end,
Democrats blocked the measures.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki revealed little about the costs or financing of the trips
to Hungary, other than to say that the chamber of commerce was
paying for it. He said he did not want the state government to pay
for the travel _ even though, he said, New York would benefit from
the increased trade ties with Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think having the Hungarian-American Chamber of Commerce pay
for the trip makes perfectly good sense,'' Pataki said at the time.
``We could justify it as a government expense, but I wouldn't do
that. And I think this is a better way for taxpayers.''
</P>
<P>
   He did tell the state Ethics Commission how much the chamber was
paying, but under the law, the commission does not release that
information.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Founded in 1992, the chamber says it promotes the interests of
American companies doing business in Hungary by sponsoring trade
missions, forums and other activities. Its officials say it now has
roughly 125 members, many of them small companies and individuals
paying dues of under $1,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris was different. For instance, the $10,000 it gave
on Sept. 15, 1995, about a week before the first trip, was 26
percent of the chamber's total revenues for its fiscal year _
$38,287, according to its tax filings.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Monika Szarka-Elling, the chamber's
president, would not discuss its membership, budget or the
financing of the two trips. She said that she did not know why
Philip Morris contributed but that the Pataki administration had
not helped the group to raise money.

OWNER OF CONNECTICUT NUCLEAR PLANT ACCEPTS RECORD FINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)  (mk) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ The owner of the Millstone Nuclear Power
Station in eastern Connecticut admitted Monday that it had
falsified environmental records and deliberately promoted
unqualified plant operators. The owner, Northeast Nuclear Energy
Co., pleaded guilty to 23 federal felonies and agreed to pay $10
million in fines, the largest penalty ever for a nuclear plant in
this country.
</P>
<P>
   The violations took place from 1994 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In entering the guilty plea in U.S. District Court here,
Northeast admitted that hydrazine, a toxic chemical used to reduce
corrosion of pipes, had gushed into Long Island Sound at a rate of
one gallon an hour during 1996 and that testers at the company had
diluted their samples with ocean water to hide the problem from
federal regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors said Monday that they were unable to prove
environmental harm from the hydrazine.
</P>
<P>
   The company also admitted that after it submitted fraudulent
information to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 12 control-room
operators received federal licenses. Problems with the training
program at Millstone came to light in 1996 when six of seven
candidates for control-room operator licenses failed federal exams,
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   In presenting the evidence in court Monday, the prosecutors said
the corner-cutting could have put the plant in the hands of workers
unable to prevent a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation, previously secret, came to light in court
Monday when the company waived indictment and pleaded guilty. As
part of the plea agreement, the company was put on three years'
probation, which allows prosecutors to monitor operations more
closely.
</P>
<P>
   The Millstone case is just the second time that a nuclear power
plant owner had been charged with felonies. Fifteen years ago, in
the aftermath of the 1979 accident at the Three Mile Island plant
near Harrisburg, Pa., which began the industry's plunge from public
acceptance, Metropolitan Edison pleaded guilty to falsifying
records at the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Millstone said they hoped Monday's pleas would end
the long period in which the plant has been considered a national
symbol of mismanagement in the nuclear power industry. Millstone
had held the previous record for a fine levied against a nuclear
plant _ $2.1 million in 1997. In 1986, a Time magazine cover story
treated the plant as an egregious example of lax enforcement of
federal regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The three reactors in Waterford, Conn., were shut down under
orders from the NRC because of problems with design, safety and
paperwork. One of the three reactors is being decommissioned, while
the other two have been restarted and are producing energy.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, the utility has hired new executives and taken steps
that it says would prevent violations in the future. Federal
prosecutors, while describing the old offenses in harsh terms, said
in Monday's proceedings that they had confidence in the new
managers.
</P>
<P>
   After the large number of Millstone candidates flunked their
licensing tests, investigators discovered that they had not put in
the required number of training hours nor mastered the maneuvers
that Millstone had falsely claimed, the government charged. Some of
the candidates have since been retrained and are now on the job,
the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors said economic pressure brought on by
deregulation of the nuclear industry had contributed to the
violations. ``Rather than treat the problem,'' said Joseph
Hutchison, an assistant U.S. attorney, ``the shortcut was taken so
there was some economic saving.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison said complaints by community groups and workers at the
plants had led to to the three-year federal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Robinson, the U.S. attorney for Connecticut, said of the
agreement, ``No matter who you are, no matter how big or how
powerful, if you endanger our citizens, if you violate the law, if
you lie to regulators and choose profits over the public, we will
come after you.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Morris, the chairman and chief executive of Northeast
Utilities, the parent of Northeast Nuclear, did not dispute a
statement that the violations were deliberate, but said the public
had never been in danger. As he left the courthouse Monday, Morris
attributed the violations to ``inattention to detail'' and
``inadvertence,'' not deregulation. ``The whole notion that you
react differently in a competitive marketplace is true, but it
doesn't cause this kind of behavior,'' he said. He said the lesson
for plant owners was ``it's better to operate within all of the
laws and the requirements because these kinds of fines, these kinds
of embarrassments, will come your way if you don't.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Morris was hired in 1997, after the offenses took place.
Nevertheless, Judge Robert Chatigny called him to the front of the
court Monday morning and told him sternly he hoped the plea
reflected a commitment by the company ``to be a better citizen in
the future than it was in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Chatigny added that despite the efforts of those who work in the
public interest, ``Ultimately, the public has to depend on the good
faith, honesty and integrity of the people who manage our large
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Northeast Utilities, Mary Jo Keating, said the
plea agreement should help with the plans to sell the plant, as
required by state legislation deregulating the industry. ``The
worst thing in the market is any kind of uncertainty,'' she said
from the company headquarters in Berlin, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   David Pittinos of the Toxics Action Center, an environmental
group in West Hartford, said Monday's plea vindicated residents who
had been worried about mismanagement and safety at the plant. The
admissions were especially damning, he said, because ``these
companies typically offer to do just about anything to weasel out
of criminal charges and reach some out-of-court settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 23 counts involving the nuclear plant,
another subsidiary, Northeast Utilities Service Co., pleaded guilty
to two felonies resulting from the use of a fire hose to dilute
water samples taken at Devon Station, a coal-fired power plant in
Milford. Prosecutors said that their case against the service
company was complete, but that their investigation was continuing
and that individuals might be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the $10 million in fines, Northeast Utilities agreed
to donate $1 million to endow a business ethics chair at the
University of Connecticut in Storrs, and $650,000 for an
environmental clinic at its School of Engineering; $1 million to
help local towns buy riverfront land for conversion into public
parks, and $650,000 to Riverfront Recapture, a Hartford group, for
its leadership camp for disadvantaged city youth.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement specified that the gifts were not tax deductible.
The company said it did not intend to pass the costs on to
consumers.

IRABU FAILS TORRE'S CHALLENGE AS YANKS FALL, 10-6 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was nothing Hideki Irabu could do Monday night
to force himself into the rotation for the post-season. The Yankees
will use four starters and Irabu has been the fifth option for more
than a month. What Irabu is trying to prove to Manager Joe Torre is
that he deserves to be on the 25-man roster as a long reliever.
Even that possibility is looking rather dubious now.
</P>
<P>
   Torre basically challenged Irabu to approach the start against
the Tampa Bay Devil Rays as a game the Yankees desperately needed
to win, but the pitcher lasted only two dreary innings. While Irabu
almost certainly could have pitched longer, Torre did not want him
on the mound any more. Torre appeared to be tired of Irabu's
pitches straying out of the strike zone after he was seemingly in
control of both innings and tired of Irabu's sluggish body
language.
</P>
<P>
   That the Yankees lost to the Devil Rays, 10-6, for the third
straight game at Yankee Stadium was not as meaningful as Torre's
strong message to Irabu. Torre wants a starter he can trust to
relieve one of the other starters if there is an injury or a
disastrous playoff outing, but Irabu has not shown that he can be
that emergency arm and is in a perilous position after allowing
five earned runs.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Ed Yarnall's second major league start Monday night
has become more than an innocent outing in the last week of the
regular season. The 23-year old Yarnall is supposedly going to face
the Baltimore Orioles in order to give the other starters extra
rest. But Yarnall has impressed Torre and a stellar outing could
move the left-handed rookie ahead of Irabu as the 10th pitcher for
the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees (94-62) slipped one game behind the Cleveland
Indians (95-61) for the best record in the American League and the
right to the home field edge during the playoffs, and they are only
one game ahead of the Texas Rangers (93-63). When Torre was asked
about Irabu's struggles before the game Monday night, he stressed
the importance of the outing for the pitcher and the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see him tonight,'' said Torre. ``We need this game.
I know our magic number is three. It's like we don't need a lot. We
need this game. We want to win. We want to win three games. We
can't rely on anybody else to do this for us. We need this game. I
hope he comes out of the bullpen with that attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre was speaking with reporters, but this was as much of a
challenge as the shrewd manager will ever make to a player. Irabu
did not meet the challenge. With two out in the first, Irabu had an
0-2 count on Jose Canseco. The Yankees have implored Irabu to
continue attacking when he is ahead in the count, but he stopped
challenging Canseco and walked him. Fred McGriff followed by
smashing a 1-0 fastball over the center field fence for a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the second, Irabu repeated himself. With two outs, he walked
No. 8 batter Mike DiFelice on five pitches. After Aaron Ledesma
blooped a single to center, Miguel Cairo looped a single to shallow
right. Paul O'Neill made a one-bounce throw home, but it was
slightly to the right of the plate and DiFelice barreled into
catcher Jorge Posada and knocked the ball loose to score the third
run.
</P>
<P>
   As the inning unraveled, Irabu remained stoic. The streak of
bloop singles reached three when Dave Martinez dropped a 150-footer
in front of Ricky Ledee in left to score two more and put Tampa Bay
ahead, 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   How irked was Torre with Irabu? He summoned Jeff Juden, a
journeyman who had a 5.56 earned run average at Class AAA Columbus,
for his Yankee debut in the third. Juden's first warmup sailed to
the backstop, which seemed fitting. The Yankees, who trailed 5-0
and then 8-2, briefly made the game entertaining with a late rally,
but the early damage against Irabu (11-7) was too much to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time in Irabu's last four starts that Torre
removed him after two innings. Torre lamented that the Yankees do
not know why the Japanese pitcher has sputtered in the second half
of the last two seasons, but he is 2-4 with a bloated 7.30 ERA over
his last 10 starts. Torre was searching for reasons to trust Irabu
in October. He is still waiting and time might have expired.

HOMEOWNER RELEASED FROM JAIL AFTER VOLUNTEERS CLEAN YARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 by DONALD BRADLEY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Frances Jane Todd, the 76-year-old
grandmother jailed for a trashy yard, is out of the poky.
</P>
<P>
   For that she can thank Joe Rawie, a man she had never met.
</P>
<P>
   On a rainy Monday morning, Rawie sent his construction crew _
and a few borrowed workers _ to clean the woman's south Kansas City
yard. In a steady drizzle, they hauled off three dump-truck loads
of trash and debris. They trimmed trees, fixed windows and mowed
weeds.
</P>
<P>
   Todd was released about 5 p.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could see the moon, I would jump over it,'' said Todd,
who had been incarcerated at the Kansas City Municipal Corrections
Institution since Aug. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Free Frances'' effort began when Rawie, 35, a construction
contractor from De Soto in Johnson County, woke up Monday and read
about Todd in The Kansas City Star.
</P>
<P>
   He also listened to radio station Q-104's Randy Miller, who put
out a call for volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Todd, who had a long history of property-code violations, had
been sued by the city. She lost the case, and 90 days later, with
the yard still trashed with old tires, boards and concrete blocks,
a judge found her in contempt and sent her to jail until the work
was done.
</P>
<P>
   Five adults who live at the house or stay part time _ a
daughter, a son, two grandchildren and a family friend _ had been
slow to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   Rawie got on the phone to his crew members, who typically do not
work in the rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing something special today,'' he told them. Then he
called other contractors. D.F. Freeman Contractors of Shawnee
volunteered two tandem dump trucks and drivers. Shawnee Mission
Tree Service sent trucks and workers.
</P>
<P>
   By 8 a.m. the convoy was rolling. It soon arrived at Todd's
house on a narrow, tree-lined street in the Ruskin Heights area.
</P>
<P>
   The job took four hours. As the group worked, more volunteers
arrived to help.
</P>
<P>
   Rawie gave Todd's relatives a new lawn mower. And then, he said,
he gave them ``a little preaching.''
</P>
<P>
   He told them they should do more to take care of Todd, that they
should not take her for granted. Keep her yard mowed and trash
picked up, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll do this one time,'' he told them. ``I don't want to have
to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Vassey, the family friend who stays at the house, said he
and others helped with the work. Shirin McCormick, Todd's daughter,
offered thanks to everyone who wanted to help.
</P>
<P>
   Rawie started Blacktop Paving and Construction, based in Eudora,
Kan., four years ago. Business has been good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured it was time to give something back to someone who
needed a little help,'' said Rawie, who estimated the job cost him
$1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Don't call him a hero, he said. Plenty of other people would
have done the job had he not.
</P>
<P>
   From the number of telephone calls and e-mails received at The
Star, it appeared that Rawie was right.
</P>
<P>
   Contractors, social clubs, individuals, senior citizen groups,
college students and families called to volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   Some were outraged at Holly Steinhauser, an assistant city
attorney, for pursuing Todd. But most blamed Todd's relatives for
not working harder to get her released.
</P>
<P>
   And some pointed the finger at Todd. It's about time the city
cracked down on those who do not keep their property clean, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kansas City is a great place to live, and we all have to get
along,'' Martha Sharp said. ``Sometimes, it takes somebody like
Holly Steinhauser to come along and make tough choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd has promised to keep her place neater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to do my darndest,'' she said.

ASTROS WILL PLAY FOR KEEPS AS THEIR ERA ENDS IN THE DOME 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Today is cq in lede) 
 
By DAVID BARRON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Today begins the final week in the final season of
Astros baseball at the Astrodome, but who cares about nostalgia
when there's a playoff race afoot?
</P>
<P>
   It is the sharp reality of the here and now, rather than warm
fuzzies from 35 years of Astrodome memories, that consumes the
Astros and their fans with the Cincinnati Reds coming to town for
two games beginning Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the Astros spent their day off Monday at pitcher
Shane Reynolds' benefit golf tournament in Fort Bend County, the
Reds threw the National League Central race into a flat-footed tie
with a 9-7 win over the St. Louis Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati's sixth victory in seven games, coupled with the
Astros' six losses on a just-completed nine-game road trip, put
both teams at 94-63 entering Tuesday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing. They (the Reds) don't want to go away,'' said
pitcher Jose Lima, who starts for the Astros tonight. ``They're
playing with heart, and when you do those little things, you're
going to win ballgames.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly catching them with a lot of momentum, and
hopefully they might play themselves out,'' said Astros manager
Larry Dierker. ``We have to turn it around. We haven't been playing
well, and I'm sure they will come out foaming at the mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros ran off a team-record 12-game winning streak earlier
this month, but Cincinnati stayed afloat with a 10-3 record over
the same time frame. And since that time, the Reds have won eight
of their last 12 while the Astros have dropped seven of 10.
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden, the idea of celebrating Houston's baseball
history must take second fiddle to preserving Houston's baseball
present.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thought is not that the Dome is leaving. It's us getting
into the playoffs,'' said Astros first baseman Jeff Bagwell. ``I'd
rather have a three- or four-game lead, and if we had played a
little better on the road, we would have it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we've backed ourselves into the position that we're in
right now. We knew it was going to be a big series. Now it's going
to be a bigger one.''
</P>
<P>
   It's appropriate that in the final year of Astros baseball at
the Astrodome, the team concludes with two games against the Reds
and three against the Los Angeles Dodgers on Friday, Saturday and
Sunday. Both teams have played critical roles against the Astros in
Septembers past.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1979, the Astros built a nine-game lead over the Reds in
July, only to have Cincinnati pitcher Tom Seaver predict they would
fall like a ``lead balloon'' in September.
</P>
<P>
   They did. The Astros lost the lead, pulled back within 1 1/2
games with a 3-2 win Sept. 19, 1979, before 46,178 fans, split the
next two games at home, then went on the road and stumbled again.
They eventually finished a game behind Cincinnati and missed the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nineteen years ago Monday during the magic season of 1980, the
Astros celebrated the return of J.R. Richard to the Dome for the
first time since he suffered a stroke in July. The Reds were in
town for the game, and Houston beat Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, the Astros took to the road for a three-game trip
to Los Angeles needing just one victory to clinch the NL West
title. They lost three in a row to the Dodgers, how-ever, and
required a one-game playoff win over L.A. for the first playoff
berth in team history.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1981, the Astros held off the Reds down the stretch to win
the second-half division championship during a strike-interrupted
year. However, they lost the divisional playoff series to Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   September has been kinder to the Astros the last two years, with
back-to-back division titles. Both, however, were clinched with
several days left in the season and were followed by playoff
collapses against Atlanta and San Diego, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds, whose annual tournament last year raised more than
$100,000 for the Epilepsy Foundation of Southeast Texas, said the
closer race could benefit the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've won it kind of early in the past and had some down time
going into the playoffs,'' he said. ``This year we'll see what
we're made of. With the Reds playing well and coming in for two
games, we'll see how hard we play and see what we've got.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell suggested the day off could give the Astros a chance to
recuperate mentally from recent setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to get away a little bit,'' he said. ``We didn't
play well on the road, so to take a day off and to realize what's
going on, where we have to go and how to get there will be a nice
reflection and get us ready to strap it on.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's game is a sellout except for general admission seats
in the outfield pavilion, but a few tickets remain for Wednesday's
game against the Reds. Tickets also remain for the Friday and
Saturday games against Los Angeles. The Dome regular-season finale
on Sunday is a sellout.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have worked at the Astrodome for 35 years will be
honored Friday night. Sunday afternoon will feature pre-game and
postgame ceremonies, and gates will open at 10:30 a.m., an hour
earlier than normal.
</P>
<P>
   Fans can purchase a commemorative 150-page souvenir program and
have their program or game ticket embossed as an authentic souvenir
of the final regular-season Dome game. They also can purchase a
commemorative photograph to go with their ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Charley Pride will sing the national anthem Sunday, and a
90-minute postgame celebration will include a video tribute,
introduction of the Astros' all-time team and a performance by
Willie Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, celebration may not be the operative word if the
Astros can't stop their tailspin beginning tonight against the
Reds. But 20-game winner Lima seems to think they can.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the situation, and I'm going to do it in front of
everybody,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He will be followed on the mound Wednesday by the Astros' other
20-game winner, Mike Hampton. On their performances, and those of
their teammates, hinge a season of baseball and the chance to
celebrate 35 years of memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two guys have to go out there and pitch for the day.
What they've accomplished earlier doesn't mean anything,'' said
outfielder Carl Everett. ``The goal is to win. I don't put any
emphasis on anything else. I go out there to win for the team.''

HACKETT SAYS HE'LL MAKE CHANGES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC coach Paul Hackett promised there would be
changes in playing time after Saturday's loss to Oregon, thanks to
the Trojans' school-record 21 penalties.
</P>
<P>
   So what changes are planned for this week's game against Oregon
State?
</P>
<P>
   Hackett wouldn't be specific, but one of the more noticeable
differences is expected to be a larger role for freshman linebacker
Troy Polamalu.
</P>
<P>
   Starter Sultan Abdul-Malik was flagged for a personal foul
against Oregon after clearly making a tackle out of bounds. And he
had three penalties the week before against San Diego State.
</P>
<P>
   Polamalu had a forced fumble, sack, broke up a pass and recorded
four tackles against Oregon. Abdul-Malik had two tackles.
</P>
<P>
   Another area ripe for change is the secondary, where cornerbacks
Antuan Simmons and Kris Richard each had three penalties against
Oregon. True freshmen Darrell Rideaux and Kevin Arbet are healthy
and figure to get an opportunity this week.
</P>
<P>
   The offense is a more dicey proposition. Nearly every offensive
lineman was guilty of a false start, so it's hard to single out one
target. Likely players to benefit from changes are tackle Matt
Welch and guard Faasea Mailo.
</P>
<P>
   __ Practice makes perfect: Kicker David Newbury and long-snapper
Pat Swanson worked on their timing Monday, after Swanson had
several poor snaps against Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat and I talked about that and he said he was sorry, and we
decided we were going to get in extra practice,'' Newbury said.
</P>
<P>
   Especially damaging was a poor snap that cost USC an extra point
after the Trojans took a 23-20 lead in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat said he gripped the ball too tight,'' Newbury said.
</P>
<P>
   Newbury took the blame for the missed field goals, however, and
said he knew something was wrong leading up to the Oregon game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This past week, I could tell something was there,'' Newbury
said. ``I was hitting the ball with a funny rotation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said he is leaning against reopening the kicking job and
letting kickoff specialist David Bell have a chance to win the
position.
</P>
<P>
   __ Rough weekend: It was an injury-marred three days for the
family of USC quarterback Carson Palmer. Before Palmer broke his
collarbone against Oregon, his younger brother Jordan suffered a
concussion Thursday playing quarterback for the Santa Margarita
High junior varsity team.
</P>
<P>
   __ Fox is No. 2: Senior John Fox, who started nine games in
1997, is back at quarterback full-time thanks to Palmer's injury.
He has also been practicing at linebacker this year.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on game circumstances, Hackett said he might try to
give Fox playing time against Oregon State behind starter Mike Van
Raaphorst.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 3 quarterback is walk-on Matt Dalton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm nervous,'' Hackett said about the Trojans' quarterback
depth.

THE GUGGENHEIM PROPOSES GEHRY MUSEUM FOR NEW YORK
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By RALPH BLUMENTHAL with CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum has submitted a
proposal to the city for a dramatic new curvilinear building
designed by Frank O. Gehry that would rise as high as 45 stories on
a platform over four East River piers near Wall Street in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The project, larger than one the museum had envisioned last year
for a West Side pier, has been budgeted at about $850 million and
would contain large exhibition wings, a theater, a skating rink and
other public amenities, according to an internal financial
memorandum and accounts from officials familiar with the plans.
More than a third of the cost has already been privately pledged,
said the officials, who estimated that the complex could take six
years to build.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Krens, the director of the Guggenheim, declined to
publicly discuss the proposal, one of nine for the site. The city's
Economic Development Corp. is expected to select one within the
next few months, but a spokeswoman, Bernadette O'Leary, declined to
give detailed descriptions of the proposals, which include a hotel,
a cruise-ship dock and an aquarium.
</P>
<P>
   The Guggenheim complex would be substantially larger than the
$100 million free-form museum that Gehry built for the institution
in Bilbao, Spain. Opened in 1997, the 250,000-square-foot Bilbao
museum with its rakish silhouette and titanium skin has been widely
hailed as one of the 20th century's architectural marvels and draws
more than 1.4 million visitors annually to the revived Basque
riverfront city.
</P>
<P>
   Gehry fended off questions about the project as premature.
``We're studying the way you build a building over the water and
need some input from City Planning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph B. Rose, chairman of the City Planning Commission, said
the proposal had not come before the panel and that he could not
comment.
</P>
<P>
   A model of the Gehry design has been on display in Krens'
office. It showed a cloudlike shape out of which the building rises
irregularly to a maximum height of about 45 stories. The structure
is on a platform above the piers.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-page Guggenheim financial memorandum, sent anonymously to
The New York Times and authenticated by the museum, also cites
plans for two other Guggenheim projects, an arts and technology
center on piers in Brooklyn Heights and exhibit space on Governors
Island, which the city has been seeking to redevelop since the U.S.
Coast Guard abandoned the island a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Cox, a deputy director of the museum to whom the June 24
memorandum was addressed, acknowledged receiving it from its
author, Beverly M. Wolff, a museum consultant, but said that Ms.
Wolff merely ``speculated on the potential development of related
sites, including Brooklyn.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cox added: ``That memo represents purely internal ideas that
emerged from a brainstorming session. They were entirely
speculative and have not been developed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wolff did not respond to a message left on her home
telephone Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Krens has taken the Guggenheim into a vigorous expansionist
phase, adding far-flung branches to its core location on Fifth
Avenue at 89th Street. Last year he explored building a
Gehry-designed museum on Pier 40 on the Hudson River off Houston
Street. But other groups had already made recreational proposals
for the site, and with city and state officials miffed that the
Guggenheim had not cleared its plans with them beforehand, the idea
languished.
</P>
<P>
   The new concept for the East River site was submitted to the
Economic Development Commission in February in response to a
request for proposals inviting bidders interested in developing the
site. The property includes three piers: 9, which is decrepit; and
13 and 14, with tennis bubbles on them. A fourth pier, 11, is being
retained by the city as a ferry terminal, but would be integrated
into the Guggenheim plan.
</P>
<P>
   Museum officials have briefed some outsiders on aspects of the
plan on a confidential basis, and Newsweek published a short
account of the project on Monday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Wolff's memorandum was titled ``Naming Opportunities for the
Manhattan Projects.'' While suggesting how big donors might be
attracted to a $700 million fund-raising campaign, Ms. Wolff
enumerated the features of the proposed Gehry building, which would
serve as a largely autonomous branch to the museum's flagship,
designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. The Guggenheim already has a SoHo
annex, which the museum has periodically considered closing.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to exhibition wings and galleries, she wrote, the
building would include a theater that could be sponsored by an
entertainment giant like Sony, Samsung or Warner Bros.; a grand
entry hall and visitor's center; an arts education center; a
sculpture or photography gallery; a film department; a library and
study center; an entertainment hall or boardroom, and a members'
lounge. The memorandum also cited a new department of architecture
and design, suggesting that the Guggenheim might be moving into a
field long identified with the Museum of Modern Art. Outside there
would be a promenade, sculpture garden, park and skating rink.
</P>
<P>
   The other projects mentioned were a proposed Center for Arts and
Technology envisioned for piers 1 through 5 in Brooklyn Heights,
and eight ``pavilions'' on Governors Island, where the Guggenheim
would display art.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wolff urged the museum to seek three ``founders'' who
together could put up $450 million, just over half the latest
anticipated cost. Although the Guggenheim has not approached the
city for money, the Museum of Modern Art has been promised $65
million in city money for its $650 million expansion and the
Guggenheim could be expected to request the same 10 percent
contribution, or about $85 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wolff argued against seeking to name each project for one
large donor. ``Rather,'' she wrote, ``I would recommend that
serious consideration be given to using generic names for each
complex, with naming opportunities relating only to parts of the
complex.'' Thus, she noted, the wings and each gallery within them
could be separately named.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Goldstein, the district manager of Community Board 1 in
lower Manhattan, said that residents primarily sought parks and
open space. ``We didn't want any kind of structure more than a few
stories,'' he said. Forty stories, he said, was ``huge.'' But he
perked up at the mention of Gehry, whom he called admiringly ``that
architect with the great reputation.''

GROWING COMPETITIVE PRESSURE FUSES 2 GERMAN CONGLOMERATES

   FRANKFURT, Germany _ In one of the most dramatic signs of the
pressures on European industry, the German energy and chemical
conglomerates Veba A.G. and Viag A.G. agreed Monday on a $14.1
billion merger.
</P>
<P>
   Though big, the merger itself was not the big news. Perhaps more
significant was the context: a competitive new market for
electricity in Germany that has driven prices down by 30 percent in
the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Equally startling were the two companies' plans for structural
overhaul. Their executives plan the biggest single sell-off of
``non-core'' businesses that Europe has ever seen. All told, the
plan calls for selling off almost everything outside of energy and
chemicals _ businesses ranging from aluminum production to trucking
and mobile telephone service _ with combined annual sales of nearly
$30 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The takeover still requires approval by German competition
regulators, who have already warned that the companies must do more
to open the electricity networks to rivals.
</P>
<P>
   If the merger is approved, Veba, based in Dusseldorf, and
Munich-based Viag would become the third-largest electric power
utility in Europe, after Electricite de France and Enel of Italy.
The new electricity company would have sales of about $15 billion.
</P>
<P>
   On the chemical side, the two companies would have combined
sales of $13 billion and be the world's third-largest chemical
producer. Veba owns Degussa-Huels, itself the product of a long
restructuring that included the sale of numerous subsidiaries and
the acquisition last year of Degussa. Viag owns SKW Trostberg.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, company executives said Monday that they will
keep the chemical companies separate but have them work together.
</P>
<P>
   A key impetus for the merger is the intense competition now
underway in the German electricity market. More than any other
country, Germany has deregulated the electricity market and
produced a wild spree of price-cutting as former regional
monopolies attack each other's markets with gusto.
</P>
<P>
   The competition has sent prices and revenue tumbling at most
major utilities _ including Veba's Preussen Elektra and Viag's
Bayernwerk, which serves Bavaria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Size matters, especially in the energy sector,'' said Ulrich
Hartmann, chairman of Veba, at a news conference Monday. ``It's
only by growing and by exploiting synergies that we will be able to
compensate for declining earnings brought on by increasingly
vigorous competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed merger, Viag shareholders will receive on
Veba share for every 2.8 Viag shares they own. Though the new
company will be run by both Hartmann and Viag's chief executive,
Viag's Wilhelm Simson, Veba will have control of the supervisory
board with seven out of ten seats on the board.
</P>
<P>
   Veba shares jumped 3.2 percent Monday to 55.2 euros, while Viag
shares declined 3.8 percent to 19.48 euros.
