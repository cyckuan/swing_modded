<HEADLINE> Threat of teachers strike looms over start of school; Talks continue </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - A late night round of negotiations Tuesday
apparently smoothed what had threatened to be a contentious start
of the new school year for the 47,000-student Buffalo school
district.
</P>
<P>
   The executive committee of the Buffalo Federation of Teachers
emerged from talks with district officials saying any strike action
would not occur Wednesday, the first day of school for the state's
second largest district. Talks were to continue Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''This does not mean that there still is not a crisis, anything
can fall apart tomorrow'' BFT President Philip Rumore said. ''We've
made enough progress that it would be irresponsible to do anything
tonight,'' said Philip Rumore, president of the BFT.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Maddigan, spokesman for the district, said ''we're very
encouraged with the prospect of reaching an agreement soon.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, union members unanimously authorized the executive
board to take any necessary action, including a strike, to secure a
contract. Teachers for the district are still working under the
terms of a contract that expired in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials said the five-year contract offered by the board
includes no pay raise in the first year and increases of 1 percent,
2 percent, 1.5 percent and 2 percent in subsequent years. Teachers
also are being asked to work an extra two days a year with no
additional pay and the board wants retirees to accept a cut in
health benefits, according to the union.
</P>
<P>
   The district's 3,800 teachers earn an average of $55,000 a year,
Maddigan said, and three-quarters also receive annual pay
increments ranging from 1.5 percent to 5 percent, depending on
their levels of education and service to the district.
</P>
<P>
   BTF members voted to authorize a strike last year, too, but
ended up going to work without a contract. Many teachers said that
was not likely to happen again.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than an all-out walkout, the teachers would likely stage
so-called ''rotating strikes,'' in which all of the teachers at
randomly targeted schools fail to report to work on specific days.
Such strikes cause districtwide disruptions while allowing teachers
to report for work four out of five days a week.
</P>
<P>
   While declining to comment on stumbling blocks, city officials
say a tight budget is the general problem. Adding to that is the
fact that the district is about to start making payments of $2
million a year to cover the cost of a lawsuit by teachers settled
for $73 million in March. That lawsuit stemmed from an earlier
contract dispute.

World Leaders Assemble at U.N.
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Secretary-General Kofi Annan today urged the kings,
generals and presidents descending on New York for the U.N. Millennium Summit to
use the unprecedented meeting to forge peace and end poverty in the 21st
century. But some heads of state are expected to use the three days of speeches,
discussions and meetings beginning tomorrow to push their own agendas --
including those that are critical of the United States. In a taste of what may
come, North Korea denounced the United States as a ''rogue state'' today,
claiming the government was responsible for allegedly ordering the strip search
of members of the delegation as they switched planes in Germany.

Barak Rules Out Breakthrough in Mideat Peacemaking
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak on Tuesday ruled out any
breakthrough in Mideast peacemaking unless Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
changes his stand on terms of a settlement. Barak's office made the statement
after the Israeli met with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to preview
President Clinton's planned back-to-back sessions Wednesday with the two Mideast
leaders on the fringes of the U.N. Millennium Summit. Barak's summit with Arafat
at the presidential retreat in Maryland collapsed in July largely over Arafat's
rejection of an offer by Barak for limited control over east Jerusalem.

Mich. Under Court Restraining Order
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- A federal judge today extended a temporary restraining order
forbidding the state from requiring drug testing for welfare recipients. The
state last October began requiring welfare applicants in a handful of Michigan
communities to provide urine samples for drug screening before they could be
considered for benefits. Under the rules of the state's pilot program, the drug
test results wouldn't affect access to food stamps and police wouldn't be
notified, but applicants who tested positive for drugs would be sent to
treatment and could gradually lose benefits if they failed to go.

Bush Unveils $158 Billion Drug Plan
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ALLENTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate, George W. Bush
outlined a $158 billion prescription drug plan today that he said would offer
senior citizens more choices and quicker coverage than Al Gore's competing
Medicare expansion. The Bush plan would fundamentally restructure Medicare,
forcing the government plan to compete with private plans for the first time. In
comparison, Bush said Gore's $253 billion 10-year plan would provide ''resources
without reform.'' Gore, in turn, said Bush won't have the money for a major drug
plan if he spends as much of the expected federal surplus as he has promised on
a tax cut.

Senate Moves On China Trade Vote
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As the Senate returned from its summer recess China trade
was the first order of business today, with leaders of both parties determined
to approve the normalization of trade relations before lawmakers close shop to
campaign before the November elections. Passing the bill this year is
''profoundly important for the country,'' said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., a
leading advocate of widening trade with China. While supporters believe they
have a solid majority in the Senate, they face two real dangers -- time
limitations as Congress rushes to finish its work for the year and the
determination of some senators to link normalized trade to China's weapons
proliferation and human rights record.

Prosecutor: Doctor To Plead Guilty
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- A former doctor will plead guilty Wednesday to federal
charges in the deaths of three patients at a veterans' hospital in New York
state, according to a prosecutor who plans to charge him with the death of a
patient in Ohio. Michael Swango is accused of injecting the three patients with
toxins at the Veterans Affairs Hospital in Northport, N.Y., in 1993. In two of
the cases, he told hospital staff the patients' families had issued ''do not
resuscitate'' orders, the indictment said. ''He's admitting to what he's charged
with and that's it,'' Franklin County Prosecutor Ron O'Brien said Tuesday.
Swango pleaded innocent in July.

   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- China is cutting 40 athletes and officials from its
team for the Sydney Olympics, including seven rowers who failed blood tests for
the banned performance-enhancing drug EPO. ''I'm very pleased,'' International
Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch said Wednesday of the doping
withdrawals. ''I'm very happy. This is very good news. It shows the new system
for detecting doping substances will work very well. ... The objective is to
have clean games.'' Sydney organizers said they were notified by the Chinese
Olympic Committee of the withdrawals.

<HEADLINE> Mexico's Congress Gets Under Way  </HEADLINE>
By LISA J. ADAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY -- Mexico's most diverse congress in history launched
its first working sessions Tuesday driven by a necessity to
negotiate and buoyed by promises of consensus over partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   The new political dynamics pose a great challenge to
President-elect Vicente Fox, who will have to barter like no chief
executive before him.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, presidents of the long-ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party simply passed down legislative initiatives to
be rubber-stamped by loyal soldiers in the party-dominated
congresses.
</P>
<P>
   But now the country's fractured ruling party is trying to hold
itself together after losing the presidency for the first time in
71 years. Fox is a member of the National Action Party.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people want us to formulate an agenda that represents
their interests not ours. .... They do not want clashes and
confrontations,'' said PRI legislator Eduardo Andrade. ''We need to
work together. When this happens the nation as a whole moves
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The new congress spent most of its first day behind closed doors
negotiating which members will head up its various working
committees, and giving speeches about the challenges facing the
most independent legislature in the country's history.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have the country's problems in our hands. Legislation is
going to be initiated here,'' said Green Party legislator Maria
Teresa Campoy. ''Before, for the most part, there was one official
party that made almost all of the decisions, but now today we are
all here for a common purpose, which is Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the issues legislators took up Monday was a program
criticized by many in Mexico for charging too much to register
cars. The PRI and the leftist Democratic Revolution Party proposed
getting rid of the recently implemented program.

<HEADLINE> Charges Dropped Vs. DNC Protesters  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Two reporters and 10 protesters arrested at a
bike rally last month during the Democratic National Convention
were cleared of charges Tuesday related to the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 194 people arrested during the convention Aug. 14-17, two
still remain in custody, District Attorney's spokeswoman Sandi
Gibbons said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   One is an animal rights activist accused of plotting to damage
local fur shops, and the other is accused of throwing bottles at
police from an apartment rooftop, Gibbons said. Officials are
pursuing four federal cases against five people, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy City Attorney Howard Gluck recommended charges against
the bicyclists be dismissed because most had spent time in jail and
had their bikes temporarily confiscated. Charges against 57 others
were dropped Friday. All had previously been released from jail.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't going to go tying up these courts when penalty has
been exacted and I have wife beaters and child abusers and drunk
drivers to prosecute,'' Gluck said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the bikers, who were trying to promote a more
bike-friendly environment, zoomed through traffic, ignored safety,
frightened pedestrians and nearly caused accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California has
filed a federal lawsuit charging that police targeted media members
in their attempts to control demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   Associated Press broadcast correspondent Brian Bland and Chicago
Tribune reporter Flynn McRoberts were arrested while covering the
demonstration. Their charges were among those dropped.

<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- A late night round of negotiations Tuesday
apparently smoothed what had threatened to be a contentious start
of the new school year for the 47,000-student Buffalo school
district.
</P>
<P>
   The executive committee of the Buffalo Federation of Teachers
emerged from talks with district officials saying any strike action
would not occur Wednesday, the first day of school for the state's
second largest district.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've made enough progress that it would be irresponsible to
do anything tonight,'' said Philip Rumore, president of the BFT.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Maddigan, spokesman for the district, said ''we're very
encouraged with the prospect of reaching an agreement soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Talks were to continue Wednesday. While optimistic, Rumore did
not rule out the possibility that negotiations could again
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, union members unanimously authorized the executive
board to take any necessary action, including a strike, to secure a
contract.
</P>
<P>
   State law forbids public employees from participating in
strikes, and imposes fines on those who do.
</P>
<P>
   But with a strike fund of more than $5.5 million in place,
several teachers have suggested so-called ''rotating strikes,'' in
which teachers at randomly targeted schools would fail to report to
work, Rumore said.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers' last contract expired in June 1999. Rumore said
the latest offer from the board calls for no pay increase the first
year, a 1 percent hike the next, followed by pay increases of 2
percent, 1.5 percent and 2 percent the final year of a five-year
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers are also being asked to work an extra two days a year
with no additional pay and the board wants retirees to accept a cut
in their health benefits, Rumore said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Tuesday
urged the kings, generals and presidents descending on New York for
the U.N. Millennium Summit to use the unprecedented meeting to
forge peace and end poverty in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   But some heads of state are expected to use the three days of
speeches, discussions and meetings beginning Wednesday to push
their own agendas -- including those that are critical of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   In a taste of what may come, North Korea denounced the United
States as a ''rogue state'' Tuesday, claiming the government was
responsible for allegedly ordering the strip search of members of
the delegation as they switched planes in Germany. The incident
prompted Pyongyang to call off the summit trip by its No. 2 leader,
who had been scheduled to meet South Korean President Kim Dae-jung.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's U.N. Ambassador Li Hyong Chol warned that the
humiliating security check could prove ''quite expensive'' for
U.S.-North Korean relations, even though the State Department
quickly said it deeply regretted the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is also expected to come under fire from Cuban
President Fidel Castro, who came to New York on Tuesday for the
first time in five years. He is expected to speak out against
American domination of the United Nations in his five minutes on
the podium Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque told a press conference in
Havana last week that Cuba would lambast ''the growing tendency of
a small and powerful group of countries'' to violate the U.N.
Charter and intervene militarily in member countries without
Security Council approval -- a reference to the U.S.-led NATO
bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The United States also can expect to get an earful from more
friendly countries.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Jiang
Zemin are likely to use the gathering to continue rallying
international support against U.S. national missile defense plans.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's announcement last week that he would leave
it to the next administration to decide whether and when to deploy
such a system will certainly be welcomed by many leaders who have
criticized the U.S. plans as a threat to 30 years of arms control
treaties.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts have predicted that Jiang will use the summit -- and
a one-on-one meeting with Clinton -- to pressure the United States
to cancel the missile defense proposal altogether. Beijing fears
that the anti-missile shields will render useless its growing
arsenal of missiles and force China into a costly arms race.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang, however, will have his own controversies to deal with as
members of the Falun Gong spiritual movement stage continuous
demonstrations against the Chinese leader for Beijing's crackdown
on the sect -- part of the 91 demonstrations planned this week.
</P>
<P>
   About 400 Falun Gong members, some of them wearing T-shirts that
read ''Stop persecuting Falun Gong'' held their meditation
exercises Tuesday morning outside the Waldorf-Astoria hotel, where
Jiang was hosting a breakfast meeting with American media
executives.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to rally Americans to try to do something to help
us,'' protester Gail Rachlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Other protests have been leveled against Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami, including a demonstration Tuesday outside Iran's
U.N. mission by a coalition of Jewish groups protesting the prison
sentences handed down to 10 Iranian Jews convicted of espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami, who has tried to reach out to the Iranian-Jewish
community here, presided Tuesday over a pre-summit roundtable
discussion attended by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and
other heads of state on forging a ''dialogue among civilizations''
to promote world peace.
</P>
<P>
   Annan said the presence of Albright at Khatami's event was a
good signal that a rapprochement between the United States and Iran
was moving forward -- ''Let's say the ice is being broken,'' -- but
National Security Adviser Sandy Berger quickly said Clinton had no
plans to meet with Khatami during the summit.
</P>
<P>
   While Albright and Khatami did not meet, a U.S. official said
the secretary of state ''wanted to be there because president
Khatami was speaking.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the gesture that president Khatami made in launching
the 'dialogue of civilizations' was magnanimous, and she wanted to
respond in kind,'' the U.S. official said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton does, however, have meetings planned on the U.N.
sidelines with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat to try to relaunch Mideast peace talks.
Berger, though, said Tuesday he saw little chance for a peace
agreement to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference to inaugurate the summit, Annan also
tempered expectations that the summit would magically cure the
world's ills. And he stressed that if leaders don't implement the
pledges they make in a summit declaration expected to be adopted on
Friday, nothing will change.
</P>
<P>
   The declaration vows to halve the proportion of people who live
on less than a dollar a day and to reverse the spread of AIDS while
seeking a more just distribution of the benefits of globalization
to the world's poor.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do have the capacity to tackle these issues, if we can only
muster the will,'' Annan said.

<HEADLINE> Scientist's Lawyers File Petition  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD BENKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Lawyers for jailed Los Alamos nuclear
scientist Wen Ho Lee, whose scheduled release on bail was blocked
at the last minute Friday, made another plea Tuesday to the 10th
U.S. Circuit Appeals Court to release him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Surely it does not serve the public interest to maintain an
imprisonment that erodes the basic sense of fairness that
undergirds the Constitution,'' Lee's attorneys wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The petition was their second appeal to the 10th Circuit, which
on Friday superseded a bail-release order that had been signed by
U.S. District Judge James Parker.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney John Cline said he hadn't heard from the
appeals court since filing a petition Friday for reconsideration of
its ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Betsy Shumaker, chief deputy clerk of the Circuit Court, said
the judges hadn't indicated whether they would schedule a hearing
on the petitions.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 60, is accused of downloading restricted material about
nuclear weapons to unsecured computers and tapes while he worked at
Los Alamos. He has been jailed since Dec. 10, charged with 59
counts, and could face life in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Parker, who signed Lee's release on $1 million bail last week,
sent the appeals court a 17-page memorandum on Friday explaining
his reasoning. He said he was concerned that the appeals court
might not have enough time to review all the evidence, much of it
classified, to make a well-reasoned ruling.
</P>
<P>
   In the memorandum, Parker said the government had failed to
present convincing arguments for keeping Lee in the Santa Fe County
jail pending trial, scheduled for Nov. 6. The judge also said he
wasn't convinced that the materials Lee is accused of mishandling
were the ''crown jewels'' of U.S. nuclear technology, as the
government contends.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the government ''has never presented direct
evidence that Dr. Lee intended to harm the United States or to
secure an advantage for a foreign nation.'' Prosecutors must prove
those two elements to convict Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say Lee, a naturalized citizen who was born in
Taiwan, is being singled out because of his ethnicity, a charge
prosecutors deny.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate court's decision surprised Parker, who said he had
been about to refuse the prosecution's bid for a stay.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney George Stamboulidis said he had been
unaware that the Justice Department had contacted the appeals court
until Parker read the court's order from the bench Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Parker had also set strict conditions on Lee's release,
including electronic monitoring, video surveillance, a phone tap,
restrictions on travel and severe limits on the number of people
with whom Lee could communicate.

Clinton's planned back-to-back sessions Wednesday with the two
Mideast leaders on the fringes of the U.N. Millennium Summit.
</P>
<P>
   During the 45-minute meeting, the statement said, Barak and
Albright ''agreed that without an open and realistic attitude'' by
''Arafat, it will not be possible reach a breakthrough toward an
agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the statement continued, Barak and Albright ''agreed
they still had not heard of a real change in Chairman Arafat's
position since Camp David.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak's summit with Arafat at the presidential retreat in
Maryland collapsed in July largely over Arafat's rejection of an
offer by Barak for limited control over east Jerusalem. The
Palestinian leader insisted on full sovereignty over the
traditionally Arab eastern portion of the city.
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. official, briefing reporters the meeting between
Barak and Albright at Barak's, gave a more subdued account. But the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said, as Barak's
statement did, that the Clinton's dual sessions with the Mideast
leaders Wednesday could be critical.
</P>
<P>
   The official said there were still differences at this point on
all the core issues, including the future of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, in Washington, Clinton's national security adviser,
Sandy Berger, said he saw little chance of a ''meeting of the
minds'' between Arafat and Barak.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see that happening this week,'' Sandy Berger told
reporters at the White House. He said progress is possible, but
added that ''it becomes increasingly difficult to imagine'' a peace
agreement emerging.
</P>
<P>
   Also in Washington, Saeb Erekat, the senior Palestinian
negotiator, told Americans for Peace Now, a dovish group, that
there had been ''major retrenchments'' in Israel's position since
Camp David. The senior U.S. official agreed that there had been
what he characteriaed as backsliding.
</P>
<P>
   With those assessments before Clinton's separate meetings
Wednesday, the Sept. 13 deadline set last year for agreement by
Barak and Arafat will probably be missed.
</P>
<P>
   And the October calendar isn't much brighter, Berger said. A
series of Jewish holy days will interrupt any negotiations between
the two sides. Toward the end of the month, the Israeli Knesset
will convene for what could be a vitriolic debate.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly half the Israeli parliament is ardently against many of
the concessions Barak offered at July's Camp David summit --
particularly a willingness to give the Palestinians local control
of a few neighborhoods and suburbs of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli lawmakers are expected to try toppling Barak, but if he
somehow manages to have a treaty with Arafat in hand by then he
could seize the initiative and call early elections.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has said it is up to the Palestinians to compromise, and
Israel's Foreign Ministry said Monday the prime minister was not
planning to present new ideas to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Before the summit collapsed, Barak had offered virtually the
entire West Bank to Arafat for a Palestinian state. The main
stumbling block was Jerusalem, which the prime minister has vowed
never to redivide.
</P>
<P>
   Israel gained control of the entire city in the 1967 Mideast
war, ousting Jordanian troops from the eastern portion they had
occupied since 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian refugees posed another hurdle, with Arafat insisting
Israel recognize a ''right of return'' for hundreds of thousands
now in neighboring Arab states.
</P>
<P>
   The senior U.S. mediator, Dennis B. Ross, presented undisclosed
compromise proposals to Barak and Arafat last week, said a senior
Palestinian official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The most difficult issue on the agenda is Jerusalem, with Arafat
insisting on sovereignty over all of the eastern part of the city,
including holy shrines sacred to Muslims and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Berger made plain the focus is on the Palestinian leader. The
White House official said Arafat had ''some very hard decisions to
make.''
</P>
<P>
   In another downbeat assessment, Berger virtually ruled out a
three-way ''mini-summit'' with Clinton, Arafat and Barak.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Offers Aid to Sect Member  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- An attorney asked the state's highest court
Tuesday to step in and review a lower court's decision to place a
pregnant member of a fundamentalist sect into state custody.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Murphy, a Boston attorney, said women's rights are
''chilled and threatened'' by Judge Kenneth Nasif's decision.
Murphy filed the request with the Supreme Judicial Court to review
Nasif's ruling on behalf of a pregnant woman not connected to the
original case.
</P>
<P>
   ''The lower court's decision squarely conflicts with a long line
of settled case law striking down similar infringements on the
important constitutional rights at stake here,'' Murphy wrote in
her petition.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy made the request on behalf of a woman who is six months'
pregnant and identified only as Barbara F. The petition said she
often travels in Bristol County, where the ruling was issued, and
could be affected by it.
</P>
<P>
   The petition said the woman is concerned the ruling means she
could someday be forced into custody herself.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said she wanted the court to scrutinize ''whether it's
correct that a woman who doesn't want and, by all accounts, doesn't
even need medical intervention can nevertheless be held against her
will by the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Fitzgerald, spokesman for Bristol County District Attorney
Paul Walsh's office, called the petition ''disingenuous, at best.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They're trying to make this into something it isn't,''
Fitzgerald said. ''This is a case, not a cause.''
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling, Nasif on Thursday placed Rebecca Corneau, 32, in
a facility for pregnant women in state custody. Corneau, who is
suspected of covering up the death of her last child, refused
medical examinations ordered by Nasif because the sect she belongs
to rejects conventional medicine as blasphemy.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors asked the judge to hospitalize Corneau to protect
her baby. Prosecutors said two children whose parents were members
of the sect are dead, and they say they want to prevent any more
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The court did not immediately respond to the petition.

<HEADLINE> Historic newspaper the subject of 2 lawsuits  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) - A historic South Carolina newspaper
remains locked in a New York vault while judges in the two states
consider who is the paper's rightful owner.
</P>
<P>
   The Aug. 2-14, 1776, issue of the South-Carolina and American
General Gazette was the only South Carolina newspaper to print the
full text of the Declaration of Independence contemporary to the
event.
</P>
<P>
   The Post and Courier Foundation bought the paper in May in an
auction at Christie's in New York City. The foundation is a
nonprofit corporation created by The (Charleston) Post and Courier
newspaper to facilitate community giving.
</P>
<P>
   Since the auction, the Charleston Library Society has filed suit
in the Charleston County Court of Common Pleas against Christie's,
the foundation and Mark Mitchell, a rare-newspaper dealer from
Virginia who sold the paper through Christie's. The library society
says stains on the newspaper identify it as part of the society's
collection. The society's suit seeks to return the newspaper to the
society's collection.
</P>
<P>
   ''There clearly is disputed ownership, and I believe that both
parties think, in good faith, that they have title,'' said Ivan V.
Anderson, publisher of The Post and Courier. ''Nobody likes a
lawsuit, but in this case it is a way of bringing all the parties
together to try to clear up the title.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Post and Courier Foundation continues to be receptive to
working out an agreement so that this historic newspaper can be
returned to Charleston and shared with the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, the dealer, also has sued in U.S. District Court in
New York against the Library Society, Christie's and a bidding
agent for the Post and Courier Foundation. Mitchell has asked the
court to give him the newspaper and for $131,600 - the amount he
would have gotten from the auction - for what he calls damage to
his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper has been locked in a vault at Christie's since the
auction house learned of the ownership dispute. Christie's says it
is a neutral party in the lawsuits and has asked the courts to take
possession of the newspaper until the issue is decided.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in New York has scheduled a
meeting Sept. 14 with the parties to determine whether he should
stop the South Carolina court action until the federal case is
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Although the newspaper came out weeks after the July 4 signing
of the Declaration, it was a breaking news story because it took so
long for news to travel from Philadelphia to Charleston. The paper
reports the adoption of the Declaration both in Philadelphia and,
subsequently, in Charleston.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Anderson said The Post and Courier Foundation bought
the paper wanting ''to return the only known copy of this important
edition of the Gazette to Charleston and to find a way to share it
with the community.''
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Mitchell said that when he first bought the paper
he called the Charleston Library Society to assess its rarity. He
said the society did not indicate then that it might be the
rightful owner.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was ecstatic when I heard the paper was bought by someone in
Charleston,'' Mitchell said in July. ''I'd like to see it come back
to where it's from. ... I'm devastated by this.''

World Leaders Assemble for U.N. Millennium Summit
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Secretary-General Kofi Annan Tuesday urged the kings,
generals and presidents descending on New York for the U.N. Millennium Summit to
use the unprecedented meeting to forge peace and end poverty in the 21st
century. But some heads of state are expected to use the three days of speeches,
discussions and meetings beginning tomorrow to push their own agendas --
including those that are critical of the United States. In a taste of what may
come, North Korea denounced the United States as a ''rogue state'' Tuesday,
claiming the government was responsible for allegedly ordering the strip search
of members of the delegation as they switched planes in Germany.

Mexico's Congress Gets Under Way

   MEXICO CITY -- Mexico's most diverse congress in history launched its first
working sessions Tuesday driven by a necessity to negotiate and buoyed by
promises of consensus over partisanship. The new political dynamics pose a great
challenge to President-elect Vicente Fox, who will have to barter like no chief
executive before him. Historically, presidents of the long-ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party simply passed down legislative initiatives to be
rubber-stamped by loyal soldiers in the party-dominated congresses.

The petition was their second appeal to the 10th Circuit, which on Friday

Barak Rules Out Breakthrough in Mideat Peacemaking

changes his stand on terms of a settlement. Barak's office made the statement
after the Israeli met with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to preview
President Clinton's planned back-to-back sessions Wednesday with the two Mideast

Mich. Under Court Restraining Order
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- A federal judge Tuesday extended a temporary restraining
order forbidding the state from requiring drug testing for welfare recipients.
The state last October began requiring welfare applicants in a handful of
Michigan communities to provide urine samples for drug screening before they
could be considered for benefits. Under the rules of the state's pilot program,
the drug test results wouldn't affect access to food stamps and police wouldn't
be notified, but applicants who tested positive for drugs would be sent to
treatment and could gradually lose benefits if they failed to go.

forcing the government plan to compete with private plans for the first time. In

<HEADLINE> British Gangster Icon Lies Dying  </HEADLINE>
By JILL LAWLESS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Reggie Kray, a frail, soft-spoken 66-year-old
suffering from bladder cancer, is the most popular hospital patient
around. He has received so many calls from well-wishers that a
separate phone line was set up to handle the flood.
</P>
<P>
   He also is a convicted murderer, a former king of the Cockney
underworld paroled from prison last month so he can die in freedom.
Kray's lawyer called his release ''a moral victory'' -- and many
here seem to agree.
</P>
<P>
   For a younger generation, Kray and his brothers represent an
ideal of razor-sharp '60s style, a vicarious underworld glamour.
For some older Britons, they recall a simpler time -- an era when
even criminals looked after their own.
</P>
<P>
   Kray is an icon of gangster chic, the last in a dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s and '60s, the Krays -- twins Reggie and Ronnie,
abetted by older brother Charlie -- were kings of the Cockney
underworld, with a network of protection and extortion rackets
stretching across London's rough-and-tumble East End.
</P>
<P>
   They ran West End nightclubs, wore sharp mohair suits, rubbed
shoulders with lords and rock stars, gave generously to charity --
and ruled their empire with the threat, and sometimes reality, of
fearsome violence.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to calling the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital to wish
him well, thousands of people -- from as far afield as Canada and
New Zealand -- have left cheery messages on a Web site set up by
Roberta Kray. ''Pity there weren't more guys like you!'' reads one.
</P>
<P>
   Equally enthusiastic are Kray's celebrity supporters, who
include the veteran British comedienne Barbara Windsor, once
married to a Kray associate; former Who frontman Roger Daltrey, who
once owned film rights to the twins' story; and Mike Tyson, who
publicly thanked Reggie Kray for writing him a supportive letter
during his own imprisonment for rape.
</P>
<P>
   ''They treat me like a dog in America, but I have friends like
Reggie Kray in England,'' Tyson said earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   This is the same Reggie Kray who in 1967 murdered bungling hit
man Jack ''The Hat'' McVitie, stabbing him so viciously that his
liver fell out.
</P>
<P>
   Brother Ronnie, who died in 1995 in the Broadmoor institute for
the criminally insane, was a paranoid schizophrenic with a
hair-trigger temper. When rival gangster George Cornell called him
a ''fat poof,'' Ronnie marched into the Blind Beggar pub and shot
him in the head as the jukebox played ''The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine
Any More.''
</P>
<P>
   Those acts of violence proved the twins' undoing. In 1969, they
were sentenced to life in prison with no possibility of parole for
30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Three decades later, their supporters express outrage at a
system that kept them in jail for so long, and nostalgia for a
vanished England. Unlikely as it sounds, the Krays have become
poster boys for old-fashioned family values.
</P>
<P>
   ''Among some of the older people, there's a hankering after an
old England, a '60s when London was much more Cockney, and about
looking after your own. An age when life was simpler, less
complicated,'' said Piers Hernu, editor of the men's magazine
Front, which has run a column by Reggie Kray and lists one of his
former henchmen as a regular contributor.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's always been a very strong sense of family in the East
End, and it's the same with the gangsters,'' Hernu said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not that Reggie was so great and such a nice guy and only
killed other gangsters -- though there's an element of truth there.
The people he killed were unsavory hoods -- much as the Krays were.
He wasn't a serial killer. He wasn't a pedophile.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, magazine spreads of models in tapered '60s
suits and films such as ''Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels''
have mythologized the sharp-dressed Cockney ''hard man'' epitomized
by the brothers.
</P>
<P>
   The Krays' own media savvy helped boost their appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Even while in prison, they turned their family name into a
lucrative cottage industry. The twins reportedly received $375,000
for a 1990 film version of their lives. An autobiography, ''Our
Story,'' was published in 1988. T-shirts, recordings and even books
of the twins' poetry followed.
</P>
<P>
   Now Ronnie is gone, followed in April by older brother Charlie,
who died while serving a sentence for drug dealing. And Reggie has
''days, rather than weeks'' to live, according to his lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie's funeral is likely to draw even bigger crowds than that
of Ronnie, whose coffin was carried in a coach driven by six black
horses through the streets of his native East End -- an East End
where Bengali restaurants, dot.com start-ups and trendy bars now
outnumber the Victorian pubs and pie-and-mash shops of the Krays'
youth.
</P>
<P>
   ''When Reggie dies, east London will be lined with thousands of
people mourning the passing of an era -- in much the same way they
did with Princess Diana,'' Hernu said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Look at Human Rights in China  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- To dramatize the plight of Falun Gong members
in China, the Clinton administration is citing the case of a
60-year old woman who died following torture inflicted by
authorities because of her activities in the spiritual sect.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Seiple, ambassador-at-large for international religious
freedom, told reporters Tuesday that after the woman's death, her
daughter was asked to pick up the body.
</P>
<P>
   ''Her body was totally covered with bruises,'' Seiple said.
''She had dried blood in the ears, the eyes, the nose. She had all
of her teeth broken. We have one credible report that she was made
to run outside in the snow with her shoes off until she dropped.''
</P>
<P>
   The recounting of that anecdote, replete with gory detail, may
make it difficult for the critics to accuse the administration of
sugarcoating China's human rights record as it seeks votes from
Congress on extending permanent normal trade relations to China.
</P>
<P>
   That is one of the administration's highest priorities during
the final few weeks of the legislative session. Approval would
facilitate China's entry into the World Trade Organization, which
sets rules for global commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Some in Congress do not believe China is entitled to normal
trade ties without conditions, and they cite continued repression
as a key reason.
</P>
<P>
   The House already has approved the legislation. Administration
officials are confident they have the votes in the Senate as well,
and Senate action could come within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Approval would do away with the annual process whereby China is
given normal tariff rates only after annual congressional reviews
of China's human rights performance.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton believes the legislation will bring enormous
benefit to the U.S. economy by lowering existing barriers in China
to U.S. trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion for Seiple's remarks was the release Tuesday of the
annual State Department report on the status of international
freedom worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The congressionally mandated report, covering 194 countries and
territories, said government respect for religious freedom in China
deteriorated over the past year as persecution of several religious
minorities increased.
</P>
<P>
   While finding that government supervision of religious activity
was minimal in some regions, the study said Chinese officials in
other regions ''imposed tight regulations, closed houses of worship
and actively persecuted members of some unregistered religious
groups.''
</P>
<P>
   The report said persecuted groups in China ''were subject to
''harassment, extortion, prolonged detention, physical abuse and
incarceration in prison or in 'reeducation through labor''' camps.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were credible reports of religious detainees being
beaten and tortured,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts believe China has come a long way from the days
when various Communist Party campaigns, including the 1966-76
Cultural Revolution, claimed the lives of millions.
</P>
<P>
   By that standard, China is a far more benign place than it was.
But that matters little to China's many U.S. critics, who believe
that China's record is abysmal not only on human rights but on
other issues as well.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jesse Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, gave a speech Tuesday on the Senate floor in which he
cited a whole host of reasons for not granting permanent trade
status to China. They included threats to Taiwan, alleged Chinese
adventurism in the South China Sea and ''reckless proliferation of
weapons among its fellow criminal regimes around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact is, the United States has had normal trade relations
with China for the past 20 years,'' Helms, R-N.C. ''Yet Communist
China's behavior has not improved one iota -- it has worsened
dramatically on every one of these fronts during those two decades
of normal trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Helms didn't even mention human rights on his list of
grievances. He said he would have more to say on the subject at a
later time.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Clinton will meet with Chinese President Jiang
Zemin at the U.N. Millennium Summit this week in New York. There
will be no shortage of issues to talk about.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Address World Leaders  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Plunging into three days of intense
diplomacy, President Clinton is addressing the largest gathering of
world leaders in history as they grapple with global problems
ranging from wars and poverty to disease and environmental
deterioration.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was one of the opening speakers Wednesday at the U.N.
Millennium Summit, an unprecedented gathering of about 160
presidents, prime ministers, kings and generals. With less than
five months left in his term, Clinton will be saying farewell to
many leaders he's unlikely to see again.
</P>
<P>
   A primary focus of his visit is to try to revive Mideast peace
talks between Israel and the Palestinians in the wake of the
collapse of the Camp David summit in July. But the president also
will concentrate on a handful of diplomatic challenges posed by
Russia, China, Africa and other trouble spots.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's first appointment was with President Vladimir Putin,
who is making his first visit to the United States as Russia's
leader. It will be Clinton's third meeting with Putin in the past
three months -- and the first since Clinton decided not to deploy a
national missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Russia had vehemently opposed the U.S. plan, arguing that a
missile shield could upset world stability and spark a nuclear arms
race. China also objected to the plan. Clinton will meet with
Chinese President Jiang Zemin on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision to leave the final decision on the missile
defense program to his successor set the stage for improved ties
with Moscow and Beijing, which had waged an 18-month campaign to
rally world opinion against the proposed shield. Putin said
Clinton's action had ''raised the authority of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Previewing Clinton's address to the Millennium Summit, national
security adviser Sandy Berger said the president would speak about
how to confront common problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''The basic U.N. Millennium Summit agenda is to discuss the
fundamental challenges that the world faces as we enter this new
millennium, from the prevention of conflict within and among
states, to the defense of human rights, to the fight against
poverty and disease, to the effort to promote growth and to protect
the environment,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   He said an underlying question was how to address the growing
need for global collective action ''with the still real
inadequacies of the United Nations as an instrument for collective
action.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger said the challenges for the United Nations are getting
bigger: building civil institutions from Kosovo to East Timor,
deploying peacekeeping missions to Sierra Leone, Ethiopia and
Eritrea, fighting AIDS and other infectious diseases and other
problems.
</P>
<P>
   He said U.N. members have to support peacekeepers with training,
equipment and organization.
</P>
<P>
   ''And for us to do that,'' Berger said, ''we need to have the
support from our own Congress for us to meet our obligations
because either we build this institution and share burdens, or we
leave problems unresolved, or we look to solve them ourselves.''

<HEADLINE> Miami-Dade Mayor Faces Tough Fight  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT TANNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   Miami-Dade Mayor Alex Penelas fought to avoid a runoff Tuesday
as nine challengers sought to deny him a second term after months
of tumult over the Elian Gonzalez case.
</P>
<P>
   With 89 percent of precincts reporting, Penelas had 118,391
votes, or 51 percent, to county Commissioner Miguel Diaz de la
Portilla's 47,847 votes, or 21 percent. Businessman Jay Love had
46,728 votes, or 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Penelas needed to win more than 50 percent to win Tuesday's
general election outright and avoid a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, in primaries in Florida and Nevada, favored
candidates for open Senate and House seats handily defeated their
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, Democrat Bill Nelson and GOP Rep. Bill McCollum
easily won their parties' nominations for an open Senate seat,
setting up a competitive race in the fall with national importance.
</P>
<P>
   In Nevada, former Republican Rep. John Ensign swiftly won the
GOP primary for an open Senate seat, defeating two little-known
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In the Miami-Dade race, Diaz de la Portilla, who lost the
campaign fund-raising race to Penelas by a 4-to-1 margin, said
Penelas ''split the community'' when he vowed that local police
would not help federal authorities return Elian to his father in
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Penelas later said police would help keep the peace, and has
emphasized ''healing the wounds'' left by the boy's case. The Elian
furor has not been a prominent part of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   With 98 percent of precincts reporting, Nelson, the state
insurance commissioner, got 675,731 votes, or 77 percent, to win
the nomination to seek the seat of retiring GOP Sen. Connie Mack.
McCollum had 649,544 votes, or 81 percent, for his party's
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, who have made inroads in the South in recent
years, hope to take the Senate seat given up by Mack, who is
retiring after two terms.
</P>
<P>
   The seat left vacant by McCollum, a 10-term GOP member of
Congress who is hoping to succeed Mack, becomes part of the
national battle for control of the House, as does a Republican seat
left open by retiring four-term Rep. Tillie Fowler.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Bill Sublette and first-time candidate Ric Keller
split the GOP vote 43 percent to 31 percent and went to a runoff
for the nomination for McCollum's seat near Orlando. The winner
will face Democrat Linda Chapin, who was unopposed.
</P>
<P>
   In the race for Fowler's seat near Jacksonville, former state
Senate President Ander Crenshaw won the GOP nomination. Retired
motel owner-manager Tom Sullivan won the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In Nevada, Democratic Sen. Richard Bryan's decision to retire
after two terms set off a scramble. John Ensign, a veterinarian and
former two-term GOP congressman, easily faced two little-known
candidates in his bid for the Republican nomination. Ensign lost
his 1998 bid to unseat the state's senior senator, Democrat Harry
Reid, by 428 votes.
</P>
<P>
   With 95 percent of precincts reporting, Ensign won the
nomination with 88 percent of the vote. In the fall, he will face
Las Vegas lawyer Ed Bernstein, who was unopposed for the Democratic
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Also in Florida, a white sheriff defeated a black police chief
who challenged him in a Democratic race rocked by allegations of
racism. Gadsden County Sheriff W.A. Woodham, in office for 29 years
in the state's only majority-black county, defeated Rodney Moore by
a 52 percent-48 percent margin.
</P>
<P>
   Moore was arrested last month and charged with ticket-fixing and
other corruption. He, along with many of the state's top black
leaders, complained of racism. The county is west of Tallahassee in
the Panhandle.
</P>
<P>
   Woodham faces nominal Republican opposition in the fall.

<HEADLINE> Gore Vows To Create High-Tech Jobs  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Al Gore is offering up a voluminous and richly
detailed spending plan for the nation, promising to create 10
million high-tech jobs, send poverty to historic lows and boost
family income by a third if his policies are put in place, aides
say.
</P>
<P>
   Senior aides familiar with Gore's plan, titled ''Prosperity for
America's Families,'' said one linchpin is paying down the debt,
casting the Democratic presidential candidate as the fiscal
conservative in his fight with Republican George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gore described his speech Wednesday at Cleveland State
University, in which he essentially will lay out the first budget
he would send to Congress if elected, as ''comprehensive and
detailed and chock-full of specifics.'' It is part of his ongoing
effort to argue to voters that he is offering them specifics and
real choices while Bush is serving up vague proposals.
</P>
<P>
   The 191-page, 69,000-word blueprint has 12 chapters and is
stuffed with charts, graphs and footnotes.
</P>
<P>
   By adopting more conservative budget projections, Gore also
would set aside a $300 billion ''surplus reserve fund'' to cover
any shortfalls.
</P>
<P>
   Among his promises:
</P>
<P>
   -- Increase real family income by a third over the next decade,
from this year's average of $47,000. Aides said a combination of
productivity increases, as well as new worker training would make
that happen.
</P>
<P>
   -- Boost home ownership rates to 70 percent, largely by paying
off the debt. Aides said that would keep interest rates low. He has
pledged to eliminate the debt by 2012, with most paid by 2010. Gore
also wants to boost low-income tax credits and increase community
investment incentives for lenders.
</P>
<P>
   -- Reduce poverty rates to below 10 percent for the first time in
history, largely by increasing the minimum wage, bolstering
welfare-to-work efforts and increasing Social Security benefits for
elderly women.
</P>
<P>
   -- Double the number of people with accumulated savings of more
than $50,000. There are currently 32 million such families, and
Gore said he would boost that number largely through new retirement
savings incentives he has proposed.
</P>
<P>
   -- Increase college attendance and graduation rates. Currently,
67 percent of high school seniors go to college. Gore wants to
increase that to 75 percent. His key proposal is to make up to
$10,000 in college tuition tax deductible.
</P>
<P>
   --Create 10 million new, high-tech jobs. With unemployment low,
the need is to focus more on better paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
   -- Reduce by half the pay gap between men and women, largely by
toughening enforcement of discrimination laws. Women currently make
73 cents for every $1 men earn.
</P>
<P>
   -- Cut the tax burden on average families, earning $47,000, to
the lowest level in 50 years within the first two years in office.
Aides argued that Gore's targeted tax cuts would do that because
they would go on the books quicker than Bush's larger $1.3 trillion
across-the-board reduction.
</P>
<P>
   By casting himself as a fiscal conservative while stressing debt
reduction, the vice president seeks to paint Bush as the big
spender. He argues that much of the nation's economic prosperity
comes because President Clinton has kept the nation's books in
order and interest rates low.
</P>
<P>
   His aides contend that the package of proposals Bush has
outlined -- including for tax cuts, Medicare drug coverage and
education -- would leave the nation $2.8 trillion in debt, while
Gore proposes to ''make America debt-free by 2012.''
</P>
<P>
   Most polls have shown Gore gaining on Bush since the Democratic
convention last month. He has campaigned on health care and other
proposals since then, dwelling at length on the details.
</P>
<P>
   He says much of his improvement in public opinion has come
because many voters are just now tuning into the presidential
campaign and are hungry for a real discussion of issues.

<HEADLINE> State trooper injured in multi-vehicle crash on Interstate 80  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCKAWAY, N.J. (AP) - A state trooper and two other people were
injured Tuesday night in a five-vehicle crash on Interstate 80,
according to the State Police.
</P>
<P>
   The trooper, identified as E. Schnezler from the Netcong
barracks, suffered a head laceration in the 7:30 p.m. crash. He was
taken to Morristown Memorial Hospital and was expected to remain
there overnight, the State Police said.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Burwell, the nursing supervisor at the hospital, said the
trooper was listed in stable condition.
</P>
<P>
   Schnezler was westbound on I-80 at the time of the crash. A
State Police spokesman said Schnezler was stopped in traffic when
his patrol car was struck from behind by another vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Two other people were taken to local hospitals, the spokesman
said. Joann Medina, 43, of Hazleton, Pa., had neck and back pains,
and Laszlo Ponisak, 58, of Bryan, Ohio, suffered chest pains.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the accident remains under investigation. The crash
snarled traffic on the road for several hours.

<HEADLINE> US Presses for Its Spending Demands  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- While congressional Republicans are eager to
wrap up legislative business for the year and hit the campaign
trail, White House officials say they are in no hurry to cut budget
deals unless President Clinton's spending demands are met.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not the calendar'' that gives the White House leverage in
Congress' waning weeks, White House budget chief Jack Lew said in
an interview. ''It's the substance that gives us the ability to
hold our ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers began returning to the Capitol on Tuesday after their
August recess hoping to adjourn in five or six weeks. Most are
yearning to get home for this fall's elections, in which control of
the White House and Congress are up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   But first, the 11 remaining spending bills for fiscal 2001,
which starts Oct. 1, must become law. Only two spending measures
have been signed, covering most defense programs.
</P>
<P>
   The unfinished bills cover the budgets of 13 Cabinet-level
agencies from the Agriculture Department to Veterans' Affairs, plus
spending for Congress, the courts and foreign aid. Clinton wants
about $20 billion more than lawmakers have been ready to spend, and
the two sides also differ over local control over education
programs, mining and other environmental issues, and other policy
disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say they are ready to do what it takes to get those
bills signed, including giving Clinton much of the extra money he
needs. But many of them say they believe the administration prefers
a lengthy confrontation that would minimize GOP accomplishments,
highlight Democratic issues and keep Republicans from going home to
campaign for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ''They want to get finished,'' Senate Budget Committee Chairman
Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said of his colleagues Tuesday. ''But
there's a concern about whether or not the White House and
Democrats want to get things done.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides insist there will be no government shutdown, such as
the 1995 and 1996 closures of federal agencies that the public
blamed on aggressive Republicans in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not looking for that kind of confrontation,'' Lew said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Democrats must be careful to not press their hand too
hard and risk a public backlash, given that the battle for the
White House and control of the House is expected to be close.
Democrats even have an outside chance at winning a Senate majority.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides know the GOP will have to yield to most of Clinton's
demands for billions of dollars in extra domestic and foreign aid
spending before remaining bills can be signed and lawmakers can
return to their districts. But realizing their leverage, Democrats
say they will be aggressive in pressing their budget demands.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not going anywhere until we're satisfied,'' Senate
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Though spending legislation will be Congress' chief focus in its
remaining weeks, lawmakers also will devote time to other issues.
These include some measures that have virtually no chance of
becoming law but will allow one party or the other to make
political statements in time for the nationwide elections on Nov.
7.
</P>
<P>
   The House plans to vote Thursday to override Clinton's veto of a
bill phasing out estate taxes. That effort and one next week
against Clinton's veto of a bill cutting taxes for many married
couples are virtually sure to fail but will let Republicans argue
that taxes would decrease with a Republican in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans hope, however, to pass tax bills this year expanding
the amounts people can contribute to IRAs and 401(k) plans,
repealing the 3 percent telephone excise tax and providing $6
billion in tax breaks over five years to spur investment in poor
urban and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   They also hope for small business tax breaks that they have
attached to a bill designed to meet Clinton's demand to boost the
$5.15-an-hour minimum wage by $1 hourly by Jan. 1, 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Daschle said Democrats will continue trying to force
votes on issues they want to spotlight for the elections, such as
increased rights for managed-care patients, gun safety and the
minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes for approval this session of broad new prescription drug
coverage are all but dead, amid partisan differences over the
program's scope and the desire by some Democrats to keep the
dispute as a campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   Some Senate Republicans already are discussing a scaled-down,
$25 billion to $40 billion version over five years that would give
states money to cover some low-income senior citizens, which they
think would let the GOP argue it had at least advanced something on
prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   GOP presidential nominee George W. Bush on Tuesday unveiled a
Medicare prescription drug proposal that would give states $48
billion over the next four years to help low-income seniors pay for
drugs in the short term while a broader, $110 billion overhaul of
Medicare was being phased in.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's opponent, Vice President Al Gore, has proposed adding a
prescription drug program to Medicare over 10 years at an estimated
cost of $253 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate also seems likely to provide final legislative
approval next week to a bill that would permanently extend normal
trade relations to China.

<HEADLINE> Man Admits Stalking Brooke Sheilds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A New Jersey accountant admitted in court
that he stalked actress Brooke Shields and made terrorist threats
against her, then entered a plea of no contest.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Bailey, 41, was ordered Tuesday to leave California and
return to his home state, where he will remain on probation for
five years. He had already served nearly a year in jail.
</P>
<P>
   He also was ordered to undergo psychiatric counseling twice a
week, to take medication as prescribed by his doctor and to report
to a probation officer.
</P>
<P>
   ''You must not harass or molest the victim or threaten use of
force or violence against anyone,'' Superior Court Judge Maureen
Duffy-Lewis told him.
</P>
<P>
   She told Bailey he may not have contact with Shields, her
agents, family or representatives for 10 years. Shields has said
Bailey harassed her for 15 years -- sending her nude photos of
himself and letters threatening her with harm.
</P>
<P>
   Shields, who did not attend Tuesday's hearing, submitted a
statement which was read in court expressing her gratitude to the
district attorney's office and saying, ''I believe that no one in
our society should have to live in constant terror and fear.''

<HEADLINE> Oasis Guitarist, Wife Separating  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Oasis star Noel Gallagher is separating from his
wife, Meg Mathews, after three years of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the guitarist said Tuesday the couple had
''simply drifted apart over the last year or so.'' She said the
pair had no immediate plans to divorce.
</P>
<P>
   The couple have an eight-month old daughter, Anais.
</P>
<P>
   Their separation follows the announcement in July that Noel
Gallagher's younger brother and bandmate Liam had split up from his
wife, actress Patsy Kensit.
</P>
<P>
   Oasis just concluded a world tour amid rumors that the band was
breaking up. Noel Gallagher, who writes the bulk of the band's
songs, walked away from the tour in May after disagreements with
his brother.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, he said he left the band to spend more time with
his wife and newborn daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't like the way that people are blaming it on the fact
that I want to spend more time at home,'' Noel Gallagher said
during a British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview. ''If you
tasted my wife's tea you wouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   He later rejoined the group for its final concerts in Britain.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened mixed Wednesday on the news of a
major deal in the financial services industry, surging oil prices
and a new low for the Euro currency overseas.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 29.22 at 11,289.83.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index was off 13.30 at 4,129.88, The

</P>
<P>
   Citigroup, the nation's biggest financial services company, said
it will buy lending company Associates First Capital for about
$31.1 billion in stock. The deal should speed up Citigroup's global
expansion in lending to consumers, giving it control of the U.S.'s
largest publicly traded finance company and Japan's fifth largest
consumer finance company.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup fell $2.06 to $55.88 in early trading, but shares of
Associates First Capital jumped $11 -- more than 40 percent -- to
$39.38.
</P>
<P>
   Across the ocean, European money traders Wednesday drove the
continent's common currency to record lows against the yen and
dollar because of concerns that European politicians and the
European Central Bank do not agree on monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   The euro fell to 87.88 cents, smashing through last Thursday's
previous low of 88.37 cents. The currency also fell to a new low
against the yen, falling to 93.00 yen from its previous benchmark
of 93.76 yen.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Wednesday in London, prices of Brent crude for delivery
in October hit a new 10-year high, rising to $33.50 a barrel. Crude
for delivery in October flirted with a nine-year high of $34.37 on
the New York Mercantile Exchange, reaching $34.35 before declining

<P>
   Citigroup, the nation's biggest financial services company, said
it will buy lending company Associates First Capital for about
$31.1 billion in stock. The deal should speed Citigroup's global
expansion in lending to consumers, giving it control of the U.S.'s
largest publicly traded finance company and Japan's fifth largest
consumer finance company.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup fell $2.19 to $55.75 early Wednesday, but shares of

$39.41.
</P>
<P>
   The euro fell to 87.88 cents, smashing through last Thursday's
previous low of 88.37 cents. The currency also fell to a new low
against the yen, falling to 93.00 yen from its previous benchmark
of 93.76 yen.
</P>
<P>
   The downturn could translate into a boost for U.S. currency and
markets, as those previously invested in the European exchanges
look for somewhere else to put their money.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Wednesday in London, prices of Brent crude for delivery
in October hit a new 10-year high, rising to $33.50 a barrel. Crude
for delivery in October flirted with a 10-year high of $34.37 on
the New York Mercantile Exchange, reaching $34.35 before declining
somewhat to $34.
</P>
<P>
   Higher prices could result in a corresponding increase in oil
company stock prices, although in early trading it wasn't clear if
it would. Shares of Exxon Mobil were up $1.19 to $84, but
Schlumberger, the oil services company, was down 38 cents at
$85.31.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue chip stocks moved higher Wednesday, boosted
by news of a major deal in the financial services industry,
increased U.S. productivity, surging oil prices and a new low for
the euro currency overseas.
</P>
<P>
   In late morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 75.10 at 11,335.71.
</P>
<P>

shares of Associates First Capital jumped $10.88 -- nearly 39
percent -- to $38.88.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Labor Department said Americans' productivity, a
key measure of rising living standards, surged at a 5.7 percent
rate in the second quarter. The strong gain pushed unit labor
costs, a key gauge of inflation pressures, down by a rate of 0.4
percent, the lowest since the end of 1999.

worried.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this truly was a long-term inflationary threat, that would
be showing up at the bond market in form of higher interest rates
and we don't see that happening,'' said Alan Skrainka, chief market

   In tech stocks, movement was downward. Shares of Micron
Technology fell $7.75 to $70.50 after Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette

<HEADLINE> Man Admits Stalking Brooke Shields  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A New Jersey accountant admitted in court
that he stalked actress Brooke Shields and made terrorist threats
against her, then entered a plea of no contest.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Bailey, 41, was ordered Tuesday to leave California and
return to his home state, where he will remain on probation for
five years. He had already served nearly a year in jail.
</P>
<P>
   He also was ordered to undergo psychiatric counseling twice a
week, to take medication as prescribed by his doctor and to report
to a probation officer.
</P>
<P>
   ''You must not harass or molest the victim or threaten use of
force or violence against anyone,'' Superior Court Judge Maureen
Duffy-Lewis told him.
</P>
<P>
   She told Bailey he may not have contact with Shields, her
agents, family or representatives for 10 years. Shields has said
Bailey harassed her for 15 years -- sending her nude photos of
himself and letters threatening her with harm.
</P>
<P>
   Shields, who did not attend Tuesday's hearing, submitted a
statement which was read in court expressing her gratitude to the
district attorney's office and saying, ''I believe that no one in
our society should have to live in constant terror and fear.''

<HEADLINE> 25 Killed in Somalia Violence  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) -- Fighting involving hundreds of Somali
gunmen armed with heavy machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades
left at least 25 people dead and 18 injured in clashes in villages
north of Mogadishu, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   The clashes lasted for more than five hours Monday in villages
near Johwar, 55 miles north of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   The violence began when more than 100 gunmen from the Galjaal
subclan attacked a village largely inhabited by members of the
Hawadle subclan, witnesses who asked not to be identified said by
telephone Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Somalis meeting in neighboring Djibouti elected
their first president and parliament in a decade, but neither has
yet established a permanent presence in the wartorn country. A
government has yet to be named, and there is no public security
force to impose order.
</P>
<P>
   Somalia has not had a functioning central government since
January 1991 when President Mohamed Siad Barre was ousted and the
country dissolved into clan-based fiefdoms controlled by armed
bands.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of Monday's clashes was believed to be related to an
incident last week in which Hawadle gunmen ambushed a truck and 20
people were killed. Johwar and its surrounding villages were tense
Tuesday, but there were no reports of renewed fighting.

<HEADLINE> Chess Records: Immigrant Success  </HEADLINE>
By JAMES REINDL
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- The story of Leonard and Phil Chess is a tale of
commerce intersecting culture with historic results. It easily
could have been no story at all, just the quiet lives of successful
South Side immigrant entrepreneurs -- junkmen and liquor store
owners.
</P>
<P>
   For the drive that eventually put the oldest of these two Polish
Jews in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame was aimed solely at money
and success, not fame and the founding of a record label synonymous
with American blues music.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Leonard could have made a million selling brushes, it would
have been all right,'' author Nadine Cohodas said in a recent
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Chess and his younger brother, Phil, made a
million times some with Chess Records, recording musicians that
listeners worldwide recognize as pioneers in electric blues, rhythm
and blues, early rock 'n' roll and even jazz. Names like Muddy
Waters and Howlin' Wolf. Etta James and Fontella Bass. Chuck Berry
and Bo Diddley. Ahmad Jamal and Ramsey Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Cohodas set out to tell the story of the Chess brothers and, as
such, chronicles an important chapter in the early life of modern
American music. Her book, ''Spinning Blues into Gold: The Chess
Brothers and the Legendary Chess Records,'' was published in May by
St. Martin's Press.
</P>
<P>
   It is a well-reported (and documented) work that punches holes
in some of the myths that have outlived Chess Records, though that
was not the author's mission.
</P>
<P>
   ''The story at one level of Chess Records is the immigrant story
of America played out in the music business,'' Cohodas said.
</P>
<P>
   On another level, the story is the relationship between the
white, Jewish Chess brothers and the predominantly black artists
they signed and recorded. Some of the artists and others have
alleged that the Chess brothers cheated black, uneducated musicians
out of royalties. There even have been charges that black musicians
were ordered to enter the famous studio at 2120 S. Michigan Ave. by
the backstair.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was prepared that this was going to be a much uglier story
to write than it turned out,'' Cohodas said. ''This is not to say
that people didn't have this or that to say about it. I spent a
delicious hour on the phone with Etta James and one of the first
things she said was, 'Do you know about my house?'''
</P>
<P>
   As Cohodas related it in her book, the elder Chess was concerned
about James' drug problems and well-being enough to put the title
of her house in California in his name. He made the payments but
deducted them from her royalties. A week after Chess died in
October 1969, a man showed up at James' house with the deed signed
over by Leonard Chess in her name.
</P>
<P>
   Cohodas paints no glossy picture of the Chess operation and
Leonard in particular. His language was crude and his motive was
business success. What emerges from her research is a portrait of a
pragmatist who, upon finding his fortune tied to a different race
and culture, immersed himself in two worlds.
</P>
<P>
   One of Cohodas' favorite anecdotes in the book is about the bar
mitzvah of Leonard's son, Marshall, in 1955. A cross section of the
rhythm and blues recording industry -- white record label owners,
producers and disc jockeys and black artists -- was invited to the
Chess family synagogue, Agudath Achem.
</P>
<P>
   Cohodas described it this way in the book: ''A centuries-old
ritual combined with present-day business, the event resembled an
R&AMP;B convention, Hebrew chants mixed in with blues.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Not just because I, myself, am Jewish, but the bar mitzvah was
very important to me,'' she said. ''To have a socially integrated
event in Chicago a year after Brown versus Board of Education was
amazing. These men were very comfortable living in the world where
they did business.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time of the bar mitzvah, Chess Records was a success with
a well-known stable of musicians playing a new electric style of
blues born in Chicago. There were other labels for R&AMP;B and jazz,
and a music publishing company.
</P>
<P>
   The Chess brothers were en route to the financial success they
sought, first working in their father's junkyard and later
operating liquor stores and clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Cohodas relied on as much source material as she could find,
augmenting it with interviews and research in the archives of
Cashbox and Billboard magazines. Perhaps reflecting her background
as a journalist, the book is dispassionate in its chronicling of
the Chess story.
</P>
<P>
   Cohodas, the author of two books on race and politics in the
South, said she read James' autobiography and was captivated by her
description of her relationship with Leonard Chess.
</P>
<P>
   ''And, as I thought about my own background, I thought there was
a connection there and that this would be time well spent.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohodas, 51, was born in Marquette, Mich., and raised in the
Upper Peninsula town of Ishpeming and northern Wisconsin town of
Appleton. Her grandparents immigrated from Eastern Europe and her
family ran a wholesale produce business.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of the University of Michigan with a law degree from
the University of North Carolina, Cohodas also worked for The News
&AMP; Observer in Raleigh, N.C., and for 10 years for Congressional
Quarterly magazine in Washington, where she still lives.
</P>
<P>
   The familial parallels are not quite even; the Chess brothers
had street sense from on-the-job training, not college. But Cohodas
related to the energy created by running a family business.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a wonderful story of entrepreneurship,'' Cohodas said.
''Entrepreneurship that really went across cultural lines. It was
an adventure and a very organic thing as it was happening.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sorry I'm too young to have been there at 2120 S. Michigan
Ave., but what a happening place it must have been.''

<HEADLINE> Devo Keeps Evolving  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN ROGERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- One might ask: Whatever happened to Devo, the
seminal '70s band that dressed in those funky George Jetson
spacesuits and played futuristic music?
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, the band that once represented the
''de-evolution of popular music'' went through its own evolution,
starting out as post-punk pioneers -- its 1978 debut album ''Q: Are
We Not Men? A: We Are Devo'' became a cult sensation -- and emerging
on the other side as purveyors of popular children's music.
</P>
<P>
   That's old news to true Devo fans -- or at least Devo fans with
small children, says Mark Mothersbaugh, the band's frontman, writer
and lead Devotee. But Mothersbaugh sometimes sees a distinct double
take when people learn that the creative force behind ''Whip It,''
''Mongoloid'' and ''Jocko Homo'' also wrote the gentle, infectious
theme to the ''Rugrats'' children's television show on the
Nickelodeon cable channel.
</P>
<P>
   ''But not so much at this point, because we've done a number of
things for a while now,'' says Mothersbaugh, a friendly,
soft-spoken man with a sly sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for 10 years he and his fellow Devotees have done the
music for ''Rugrats'' and its spinoff movies, including ''Rugrats
in Paris: The Movie,'' which is due out later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Devo's latest project is a Mothersbaugh-produced album, ''Heroes
&AMP; Villains,'' featuring music inspired by ''The Powerpuff Girls,''
one of the most cutting edge of the new wave of TV shows aimed at
the just-out-of-diapers set.
</P>
<P>
   The girls, as any 4-year-old with access to the Cartoon Network
knows, were created by Professor Utonium, who accidentally added
''Chemical X'' to his mixture of ''sugar and spice and everything
nice.''
</P>
<P>
   The result was a trio of crime-fighting heroines with perfect
hair, the latest designer clothes and the occasional fit of pique
common to kindergartners.
</P>
<P>
   However, ''The Powerpuff Girls: Heroes &AMP; Villains'' (Rhino
Records) is not a soundtrack but a collection of songs inspired by
the antics of Blossom, Buttercup and Bubbles.
</P>
<P>
   And with music from such alternative bands as Shonen Knife, The
Apples in Stereo and Devo, it is that musical oddity: a record with
appeal for both the under 5 and over 30 crowds.
</P>
<P>
   That's not necessarily what Mothersbaugh had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   From the time he was 7 -- when he got his first pair of
eyeglasses -- all Mothersbaugh wanted to do was create artistic
images -- first visually and later with sound.
</P>
<P>
   ''For all intents and purposes, I was legally blind,'' he says,
explaining both his childhood and those bottle-bottom-thick
eyeglasses that he wears. ''I couldn't read the big E on the eye
chart from 5 feet away. I remember the first day I got glasses. I
saw clouds, birds, the sun. ... It was a pretty amazing
discovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by a teacher, he set out to draw it all -- except on
Saturday afternoons when he had to take his weekly organ lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was absolutely certain music had been invented to torture
me,'' he says of those days.
</P>
<P>
   That opinion would change one Sunday night in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a cliche, but I was watching Ed Sullivan. And he said,
'Tonight, we have something special for you youngsters, the
Beatles!''' recalls Mothersbaugh, doing a fair impersonation of
Sullivan, host of a popular variety show.
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, Mothersbaugh came to this realization: ''So
that's why I had to learn music; why I had to spend all those years
being tortured.''
</P>
<P>
   Within days, he was playing in a band.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were awful, of course.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, when Mothersbaugh and fellow Devotee Jerry
Casale crossed paths at Ohio's Kent State University, the Beatles
were gone and rock music had grown stale, drifting toward big,
showy arena performances that shouted ''that's entertainment'' more
than ''that's different.''
</P>
<P>
   Bored by it all, the two amused themselves by melding Casale's
blues guitar riffs with Mothersbaugh's electronic keyboard
experimentation. The result sounded so strange, their brothers were
the only ones who would play it. To make it even more weird,
Mothersbaugh began taking old record albums and cutting little
loops into the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ''You'd get these skips in the vinyl,'' he recalls, breaking
into a repetitive, Devo-like voice. ''And I'd write music on guitar
or a little keyboard along with that. And it was just awful cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Cool enough that when someone at A&AMP;M Records heard ''Jocko
Homo,'' the company sent for Devo, which was now Mothersbaugh,
Casale and their respective siblings, Bob and Bob.
</P>
<P>
   The label declined to sign them, but Devo decided to stay in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had vowed once we crossed the state line from Akron, Ohio,
that we were never going back,'' Mothersbaugh says, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of its popularity, Devo was hailed as the
forerunner of New Wave music, introducing a sci-fi sound to the
music world with its heavy synthesizers and electronic music. The
group released five albums between 1978 and 1982, but as the '80s
wore on, the band was relegated to cult status and critical
indifference.
</P>
<P>
   Then Pee-wee Herman needed someone to do the music for a new
children's show, ''Pee-wee's Playhouse,'' and he called on
Mothersbaugh.
</P>
<P>
   The offer came just at the right time. Devo was an alternative
band hitting middle age, unhappy with its record contract and not
particularly happy with the music business or life on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like a really great job when you're in your 20s,'' say
Mothersbaugh, 50, of being a rock star. ''In your 30s, it's kind of
OK. And when you're in your 40s, it sucks. You realize that you
kind of should be doing something else.''
</P>
<P>
   So that's what he and the other Devotees do, working at their
Los Angeles-based company Mutato Muzika and scoring such films as
''Happy Gilmore'' and ''Rocky and Bullwinkle,'' doing commercials
and cartoons, even taking the occasional acting gig.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were the monkeys who escaped from the circus train in the
first 'Rugrats' movie,'' he points out proudly.
</P>
<P>
   They have even done the occasional Devo gig, touring with Beck
not that long ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''But, you know,'' adds Mothersbaugh contentedly, ''it's OK to
move on in life, too.''

<HEADLINE> Nashville Sound: Bill Monroe  </HEADLINE>
By JIM PATTERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Bluegrass music founder Bill Monroe
deserves to be ranked with giants of American music who achieved
wider fame, claim admirers, who include his biographer and country
star Ricky Skaggs.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is no less or no more important than Louis Armstrong or
Muddy Waters, or Elvis or any of them,'' says Skaggs, who has just
released a Monroe tribute album.
</P>
<P>
   The accomplishments of Monroe, who died four years ago Saturday
(Sept. 9), went beyond creating bluegrass, an undeniably remarkable
achievement. His 89th birthday would have been Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Bluegrass music -- acoustic, driving, emotional, earthy,
intricate, sentimental -- was a strong subgenre that rarely crossed
into the commercial mainstream when Monroe died in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But every decade of American music since the 1930s -- when he was
a member of the Monroe Brothers with his brother Charlie -- has been
touched by his genius.
</P>
<P>
   A mover and shaker in country music during the 1940s, Monroe
influenced rock 'n' roll in the '50s and helped revive folk music
in the '60s. He was a precursor to the confessional
singer-songwriters of the '70s, and a touchstone for the New
Traditionalist country artists of the '80s and the alternative
country music scene of today.
</P>
<P>
   ''He deserves to be ranked with Louis Armstrong, Gershwin,
Presley, Sinatra,'' says Richard D. Smith, author of a new Monroe
biography, ''Can't You Hear Me Callin''' (Little Brown).
</P>
<P>
   ''It's certainly true that these other artists sold more records
than he did,'' Smith says. ''While these other more famous figures
have had more specific influence, I think that Monroe has had a
much broader influence.''
</P>
<P>
   Skaggs' tribute album ''Big Mon: The Songs of Bill Monroe''
(Skaggs Family Records) features the Dixie Chicks, Dolly Parton,
John Fogerty and Bruce Hornsby, who interpret such classics as
''Blue Moon of Kentucky'' and ''Rocky Road Blues.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Haley's ''(We're Gonna) Rock Around the Clock'' bears a
suspicious resemblance to ''Rocky Road Blues,'' and Hornsby admits
that one of his best songs was a direct steal from Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's called 'Rainbow's Cadillac,''' Hornsby says. ''I made it
about a playground basketball legend. But it is 'Uncle Pen.'''
</P>
<P>
   Skaggs says Monroe's skill as a songwriter has been overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   In putting together the tribute album, ''We wanted to show him
off as ... a pioneer of the singer-songwriter-musician. He's in the
Songwriter's Hall of Fame, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the
country music and bluegrass music halls of fame -- all of those.''
</P>
<P>
   Skaggs has James Taylor, Shawn Colvin and Manhattan Transfer set
for a second volume of Monroe tributes, and he's working on Paul
McCartney.
</P>
<P>
   ''Elvis Costello is going to write lyrics to one of Mr. Monroe's
instrumentals,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Monroe was born in rural Rosine, Ky. He was a cross-eyed and shy
child who hid underneath his home to avoid people. He practiced
singing in the fields so no one could hear him.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's biography tells of nearly unbelievable emotional
cruelties that Monroe endured. He was virtually ignored by his
siblings, and when his mother died, he watched the body being
carried away without any explanation from his family.
</P>
<P>
   ''He certainly had this sense of alienation -- to put a modern
term on it -- of lonesomeness from his childhood,'' Smith says.
</P>
<P>
   As an adult, Monroe was highly competitive, desperate for love
and acceptance. Tales abound of his womanizing, feuds with Earl
Scruggs and other competitors, and snubs of other musicians. (The
latter was at least partly due to his poor vision and shyness.)
</P>
<P>
   ''Monroe was very much like an Olympic athlete in his desire to
be the best ... in everything he did with his life,'' Smith says.
</P>
<P>
   When kicked into the mud by a bull at his farm, Monroe got up
and kicked the bull back.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not apocryphal,'' the biographer says. ''I got the story
of the bull incident from an eyewitness. The bull's rear haunches
seemed to come up off the ground, Monroe kicked him so hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Monroe's romantic life inspired some of his best songs, says
Smith, who writes that Monroe's ''My Sweet Little Georgia Rose''
was inspired by an illegitimate child. The book asserts that
''Can't You Hear Me Callin''' and other love songs were inspired by
his stormy relationship with Bessie Lee Maudlin.
</P>
<P>
   Scrolling back through the pages of history, the Monroe Brothers
(''What Would You Give in Exchange for Your Soul'') stand as one of
the finest brother-harmony acts in country music.
</P>
<P>
   After the duo broke up in 1938, Monroe started the Blue Grass
Boys. With the help of key members like Lester Flatt, Earl Scruggs
and Jimmy Martin, a new kind of music began to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   ''He created this new music, taking elements from the old, white
traditional fiddle-playing, African-American blues, jazz elements,
pop-music elements,'' Smith says.
</P>
<P>
   Bucking the ''country hick'' stereotype, the Blue Grass Boys
dressed in suits and were cleanshaven.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bill's father was a prosperous farmer. That was really how
good country people dressed and behaved. They were not barefoot in
bib overalls with jugs of alcohol by their side,'' Smith says.
''When Monroe was fighting this hillbilly image, he was really
fighting for a truer image of country life than the people who were
trying to popularize it with the hillbilly image.''
</P>
<P>
   Bluegrass was wildly popular until rock 'n' roll exploded.
Presley, Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash and Jerry Lee Lewis were Monroe
fans.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was like he played the mandolin with a rock 'n' roll
heart,'' Skaggs says. ''It wasn't even called rock 'n' roll in
those days, but he played a mandolin with that kind of attitude. I
think that really did spur that whole movement with young people.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith compares Monroe to John Ford, the director of classic
Western movies.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ford had a great influence on American filmmakers and European
filmmakers because of his art and his style,'' Smith says. ''Yet
because he made Westerns, he was sort of relegated by the critics
off to just being considered somebody who directed Westerns.
</P>
<P>
   ''Monroe is considered just as the father of bluegrass. He's
really more than that. He's a great creator and much more than just
this niche artist.''

<HEADLINE> Neil LaBute Might Bite You  </HEADLINE>
By DOUGLAS J. ROWE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Careful. Don't get too close.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, ''Nurse Betty'' is a screwball comedy from the director of
those searing indictments of human nature, ''In the Company of
Men'' and ''Your Friends &AMP; Neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   No, a new Panglossian Neil LaBute is not sitting in front of
you.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you think so, come closer. Let's see if you're right. Maybe
you can pet me, and maybe I'll bite your finger off,'' the
37-year-old director-screenwriter-playwright says with a smile -- as
you keep your hands to yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nurse Betty'' stars Renee Zellweger as a woman so shocked by
her husband's murder (at the hands of hit men Morgan Freeman and
Chris Rock) that she believes her favorite soap opera is real -- and
that she's the long-lost love of its leading man (Greg Kinnear).
It's a little like ''The Wizard of Oz'' meets ''Harvey'': She's a
dreamy gal from Kansas with an imaginary friend -- except he's
played by a flesh-and-blood actor and she travels cross-country to
meet him.
</P>
<P>
   ''By going a little wacky, she actually ends up getting to that
thing that her dreams are made of,'' LaBute says.
</P>
<P>
   His writing-directing debut, ''In the Company of Men,'' which
won the Filmmakers Trophy at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival, is
the story of two men who conspire to leave a pretty, deaf woman in
a crumpled heap by wooing her and then dumping her. ''Your Friends
&AMP; Neighbors'' in 1998 focused on emotional treachery and sexual
dysfunction among people who supposedly like each other.
</P>
<P>
   The camerawork in ''Nurse Betty'' has a fluidity that LaBute's
previous work didn't. And its characters enjoy a certain redemption
and transcendence unlike those in his first two films.
</P>
<P>
   But ''Nurse Betty'' contains some lacerating violence, and it
qualifies as a dark -- as well as a screwball -- comedy. So it's not
totally dissimilar to his earlier movies: The men are
''questionable'' -- to use LaBute's word -- and they're after a
woman.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think this has suddenly made me a sunnier person. I'm
relatively sunny as it goes,'' LaBute says. ''I like, as a viewer
as well as a filmmaker, things that challenge me and make me sit up
and go, 'Whoa, what are they doing here?' So I'm sure I'll continue
to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, his fans might be forgiven for thinking his cynicism and
disgust with the human condition have abated.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've briefly given them a grace period before moving on in my
assessment of humankind,'' the burly, bearded and bespectacled
LaBute says. ''As a writer, I still continue to want to examine,
pretty ruthlessly, the way people behave.''
</P>
<P>
   One publication called his earlier films ''the meanest movies in
Hollywood.'' But he's also been compared to David Mamet, and The
Wall Street Journal has ventured that ''your reaction to Mr.
LaBute's work is a highly personal matter, depending on one's
convictions about human nature and one's threshold for emotional
queasiness.''
</P>
<P>
   LaBute, who grew up outside Spokane, Wash., earned a master's
degree in theater and film history from the University of Kansas
and studied dramatic writing at New York University.
</P>
<P>
   He decided to direct ''Nurse Betty'' because he never imagined
writing or directing a film like it, and he liked the idea that
people would be surprised that he even could make such a film.
</P>
<P>
   ''You should constantly try and surprise an audience. You should
make an audience never quite know where you're going to go, because
I think audiences like to be surprised and not be able to pin you
down completely.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also the first film he's directed that he didn't also
write, although he's directed plenty of theater productions written
by others.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a distance in it that comes from not writing it. From
saying, 'I'm working more like an editor.' I'm looking at it and
saying, 'I can see what works here, what doesn't, what needs to be
worked on.' In a way, you don't have that feeling when you've
written something; you're really close to it, and it's hard to back
away and figure it out.''
</P>
<P>
   LaBute says it's unfortunate that ''In the Company of Men'' was
tagged with a misogynistic monicker because ''it's hard to shake
something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   His rebuttal: People should see the film firsthand because they
would see it was the men who come out looking bad, not the women.
</P>
<P>
   ''You hate it when things get misread, but then sometimes it's
just inevitable,'' he says, because people often read a thumbnail
quote or review and don't know the work itself.
</P>
<P>
   He had a similar problem when the Mormon church was upset by the
Mormon characters in ''Bash,'' his trio of one-acts produced
off-Broadway last year.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Brigham Young University and a practicing Mormon
(''practicing, but probably in need of more practice''), LaBute
says he's not at odds with the church, adding, ''In terms of my
work, I think it's sometimes off-putting to them.''
</P>
<P>
   It can even be off-putting to his wife Lisa, a family therapist.
(They have a 12-year-old daughter and a 9-year-old son.) ''Like
anything, there's stuff that she likes and stuff that she
disapproves of,'' he reports.
</P>
<P>
   As cozy and life-affirming as his home life sounds, he has a
gimlet-eyed view of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who was it that had that lovely quote? It was like Flaubert
who said, 'Live your life quietly so you can be savage in your
work.' Or something like that -- I'm paraphrasing it,'' LaBute says.
''But yes. Two different things. Two beasts. The way you want to
write about things and the way you live your life.''
</P>
<P>
   As the sheriff in ''Nurse Betty'' says when he suspects she
killed her husband: ''Just because I'm thinking it doesn't mean I
like it.'' As LaBute well knows, people sometimes confuse an
observation with an endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Don't, he cautions.
</P>
<P>
   He's heading off to do a romance now, which he hopes further
surprises -- and entices -- moviegoers to his work.
</P>
<P>
   ''It just allows them to come a little closer. But be careful,
is all I can say. I'm not through yet.''

<HEADLINE> Spinal Tap Returns to Theaters  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Crank those cinema speakers up to 11. The
boys of Spinal Tap are back in theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ''This Is Spinal Tap,'' the mock-rock movie that taught us
there's more than one way to off a drummer, returns to the screen
Friday for a brief run to whip up publicity for a new VHS and DVD
release a few days later.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Reiner's feature-film debut has become one of Hollywood's
oddest artifacts in the 16 years since its release. ''Spinal Tap''
stars Christopher Guest as guitarist Nigel Tufnel, Michael McKean
as singer David St. Hubbins and Harry Shearer as bass player Derek
Smalls, the core of one of Britain's loudest -- though fictional --
bands; musicians who muddle on well after their time has passed.
</P>
<P>
   The movie has developed a cult following of fans who can carry
on entire conversations by quoting its memorably absurd yet deadpan
dialogue, from the amplifier that goes to 11 (it's one louder than
10) to the band manager who is told, ''It's not your job to be as
confused as Nigel.'' Fans have paid upward of $100 on eBay for a
previous, out-of-print DVD version of ''This Is Spinal Tap.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There are people who come up to us and say, 'This is the
greatest movie ever made,''' McKean said. ''You've got to say
something to that. You can't let them go on believing that. But
when you get people blurting out quotes from the movie, it's
tremendously flattering. It has entered the language to some
extent.''
</P>
<P>
   The film puzzled some moviegoers who thought it was a
documentary about a real group of aging rockers. Guest tells the
story of a conversation he overheard at a test screening of the
movie, when a woman turned to a friend and said, ''These guys are
really stupid. Why would they make a movie about these guys?''
</P>
<P>
   The make-believe Spinal Tap also has taken on a strangely
authentic life as a real band. The group cut an album and toured in
the early 1990s. They regroup periodically for concerts, and they
recently offered a new song over the Internet. The threesome even
made an appearance as Spinal Tap on ''The Simpsons,'' where Shearer
is a regular.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is now a real band,'' Guest said. ''Without getting
delusional in a sense, we go out and we play a two-hour show. It's
not as if we play a song then do some sketches or comedy
material.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the more surreal moments came when Spinal Tap played
London's Royal Albert Hall. Backstage, a boy asked for Guest's
autograph. After signing it, he noticed the boy's father waiting
behind him. It was George Harrison, Guest said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought, this has now come more than full circle,'' Guest
said. ''The Beatles played this place, but we're a fictional band
playing there. It's all dovetailing into this Fellini-esque
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie was ranked 29th on the American Film Institute's
recent list of funniest U.S. films.
</P>
<P>
   Along with MGM's reissue of the movie, New Line Cinema has
licensing rights for new Spinal Tap merchandise, including action
figures, trading cards, posters and clothing. Bloomsbury Books is
publishing ''The Official Spinal Tap Companion,'' including photos
and a full transcript of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Spinal Tap got its start as a sketch spoofing second-rate
rockers on a TV special Reiner made in the late 1970s. Reiner,
Guest, McKean and Shearer decided to expand it into a feature film,
shooting a 20-minute demo that eventually got them financing for
the full movie.
</P>
<P>
   They created a long discography that included the albums
''Intravenus deMilo'' and ''The Sun Never Sweats'' and a full
history for each band member so the actors could respond in real
impromptu manner to questions posed by Marty DiBergi, the
''documentary filmmaker'' played by Reiner.
</P>
<P>
   Some gags were worked out beforehand, but the band mates said
most of the dialogue was improvised to lend authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   When Reiner reads off a review for Spinal Tap's ''Shark
Sandwich'' album, a two-word critique calling it an ''(expletive)
Sandwich,'' Guest turns to McKean and chuckles.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you see my character laugh at that, that was me really
laughing, because I hadn't heard that before,'' Guest said. ''That
was my real reaction you see in the film.''
</P>
<P>
   Their matter-of-fact replies accentuate the humor of the
outlandish things the Tapsters say, including their rundown of the
band's doomed drummers: One died in a ''bizarre gardening
accident,'' one spontaneously combusted, and one choked on vomit
(though it was unclear whose vomit it was, since ''you can't really
dust for vomit'').
</P>
<P>
   Reiner shot 50 hours of footage, then assembled a four-hour
rough cut from which the final film was fashioned. The new DVD of
''This Is Spinal Tap'' includes some of those outtakes, along with
music videos, an interview with ''Marty DiBergi'' and audio
commentary by the band members, who gripe about the hatchet job
DiBergi did on them.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's cult following continues to grow. Manhattan
dermatologist Dr. Michael Whitlow and his wife recently watched the
movie for the first time. Whitlow enjoyed it so much, he shelled
out $120 on eBay for the out-of-print DVD version.
</P>
<P>
   ''I picked it up on a whim and had no idea what it was about,''
Whitlow said. ''It was a such a scream. Both of us were rolling on
the floor laughing. It works on sort of a sociological sense,
making fun of that lifestyle. The songs they do are so funny, but
the lyrics really are similar to real songs you might actually
hear.''
</P>
<P>
   The occasional Spinal Tap reunions extend the gag of a bunch of
middle-aged adolescents still trying to rock. Shearer's wig in
recent appearances included a bald spot to accentuate the
incongruity between the band members' ages and lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   The band regroups now and then mainly for the fun of it, said
the Spinal Tapsters, who have been friends and colleagues for
decades. Guest and McKean were roommates and wrote songs together
in the late 1960s, and McKean co-stars in Guest's upcoming comedy
''Best in Show.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's about reconnecting with people,'' McKean said. ''Onstage,
we're pretending to be a rock and roll band, and all you nice
people are pretending to be our audience. It's kind of like having
your best friends help you at your job. It's way too much fun to
imagine not doing it again.''

<HEADLINE> 5 Hurt at Mexican Transformer Fires  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Ten transformers caught fire at a
hydroelectric plant outside Mexico City, injuring five workers, the
Federal Electrical Commission said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The fire in the Tingambato plant late Tuesday trapped five
maintenance workers, but two were rescued and three were able to
escape, officials said in a news release. All were in good
condition. Earlier media reports had said three dozen people were
injured, but a spokesman denied that Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze did not affect electrical service in Mexico. Officials
said they would start an investigation to determine the fire's
cause.

<HEADLINE> Revamped Comoros State To Be Set Up  </HEADLINE>
By RODRIQUE NGOWI
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) -- The republic of Comoros will be
overhauled, getting a new name, flag and constitution as part of a
deal to end a three-year secessionist push by one of its three
islands, a senior government official said.
</P>
<P>
   The reconciliation deal was signed Saturday by military ruler
Col. Azali Assoumane and separatist leader Lt. Col. Said Abeid
Abderemanein, the secretary general in the president's office said
Tuesday in a telephone interview from the capital, Moroni. The
secretary general, Mahmoud Saleh, said the overhaul will take place
within the next 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot is to change in Comoros, including symbols of the state
such as the name of the republic, the national flag and
constitution,'' Saleh said. ''But our internationally recognized
borders and unity are to remain intact, and to get Anjouan to
accept that was an achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   Announcement of the deal sparked clashes in Anjouan between
supporters and opponents of the declaration, Saleh said.
''According to our reports, at least 11 people, including elements
of the local militia, have been arrested, and fighting has
stopped,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Assoumane's government unilaterally lifted the
travel, communications and economic sanctions the Organization of
African Unity had slapped on Anjouan after the island failed to
abide by an OAU-brokered agreement. But Anjouanese residents on
Grande Comore, the main island, told The Associated Press that the
situation in Anjouan remains tense and many were scared to travel
to Anjouan despite the lifting of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   With an estimated population of 692,000, Comoros lives off
exports of vanilla, ylang-ylang flowers for perfume and cloves and
remittances from Comorians living abroad, mainly in France. The
three-island republic has been plagued by coups, assassinations,
military rule and secession attempts since independence from France
in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   The separatist crisis erupted in July 1997 when Anjouan and
Moheli announced plans to secede. Since then, the OAU has used
diplomacy and sanctions in an unsuccessful attempt to persuade
Anjouan separatists to renounce independence claims.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1999, representatives of the three islands met in
Madagascar under OAU mediation. Grande Comore and Moheli agreed to
a peace plan, but Anjouan representatives said they had to consult
other islanders first. Assoumane assumed power in a military coup
later in April after violent demonstrations in Moroni against
Anjouan residents there.
</P>
<P>
   Many in Grande Comore are skeptical about the motives behind the
separatist leader's decision to return to the fold.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not believe the separatist leadership is ready for
normalization of political life in Anjouan and restoration of a
democratic process because they have lost the goodwill of the
population,'' Thineya Mwinyi said by telephone from Moroni.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, the constitution would grant the three islands
considerable control over their own internal affairs. The central
government would have jurisdiction over external affairs, external
defense, currency and religion, the joint declaration said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 89; Nasdaq Loses 64  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue chip stocks moved higher Wednesday, boosted
by news of a major deal in the financial services industry and
surging oil prices, but high-tech stocks declined after as analysts
downgraded their ratings on several high-profile companies.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said a government report on higher U.S. productivity
and a new low for the euro currency overseas helped boost big-name
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 89.15 at 11,349.76.
</P>
<P>
   But the high-tech driven Nasdaq composite index was off 64.05 at
4,079.13. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 2.24 at
1,504.84.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup, the nation's biggest financial services company, said
it will buy lending company Associates First Capital for about
$31.1 billion in stock. The deal should speed Citigroup's global
expansion in lending to consumers, giving it control of the U.S.'s
largest publicly traded finance company and Japan's fifth largest
consumer finance company.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup, a Dow component, fell $2.44 to $55.50 at midday, but
shares of Associates First Capital jumped $11.31 -- more than 40
percent -- to $39.31.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Labor Department said Americans' productivity, a
key measure of rising living standards, surged at a 5.7 percent
rate in the second quarter. The strong gain pushed unit labor
costs, a key gauge of inflation pressures, down by a rate of 0.4
percent, the lowest since the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The report bolstered investors' belief that interest rates will
remain stable for the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, the euro fell to near 87 cents, smashing through last
Thursday's previous low of 88.37 cents. The currency also fell to a
new low against the yen, falling to 93.00 yen from its previous
benchmark of 93.76 yen.
</P>
<P>
   The downturn could translate into a boost for U.S. currency and
markets, as those previously invested in the European exchanges
look for somewhere else to put their money.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Wednesday in London, prices of Brent crude for delivery
in October hit a new 10-year high, rising to $33.50 a barrel. Crude
for delivery in October surpassed the previous 10-year high of
$34.37 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, reaching $34.45 before
declining somewhat to $34.31. Higher oil prices are considered by
some to be a potential inflationary pressure, but at least one
analyst wasn't worried.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this truly was a long-term inflationary threat, that would
be showing up at the bond market in form of higher interest rates
and we don't see that happening,'' said Alan Skrainka, chief market
strategist at Edward Jones of St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Tech stocks were depressed for a second day by analyst
downgrades of prominent companies.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Micron Technology fell $7.69 to $70.56 after
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette lowered its rating on the memory
chipmaker from ''buy'' to ''underperform.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, high-tech stocks declined after a Piper Jaffray
analyst lowered the investment firm's rating on Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of telecommunications chipmaker Applied Microcircuits
were down $9.38 at $180.44.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues narrowly led decliners on the New York Stock
Exchange. Volume came to 454.21 million shares, compared to372.25
million the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 3.06 at 535.96.

<HEADLINE> Neo-Nazis Seek OK for Protest  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Neo-Nazis have renewed efforts to demonstrate at
Germany's planned Holocaust memorial on the anniversary of the
Auschwitz death camp's liberation, weeks after a far-right party
withdrew a similar request, a city official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The neo-Nazis, who do not belong to an organized group, have
applied for permission to demonstrate Jan. 27 at the site of the
memorial near the historic Brandenburg Gate, Berlin Interior
Minister Eckart Werthebach told a Berlin radio station. The date is
Germany's memorial day for the victims of Nazism, marking the 1945
liberation of the Nazi concentration camp where 1.5 million people
were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Werthebach and a leader of the local Jewish community said they
hoped laws on public assemblies will be tightened in time to
prevent the demonstration, which could also be barred on safety
grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians have called for a stop to demonstrations around the
Brandenburg Gate, where Hitler's troops once held their torch-lit
parades. In January, neo-Nazis were allowed to march through the
gate for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ''Democracy suffers far less from restricting the right to
assemble in public than when the state allows that right to be
repeatedly abused,'' Andreas Nachama, head of Berlin's Jewish
community, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Nachama also added his voice to calls for the government to
outlaw the extreme-right National Democratic Party of Germany, or
NPD, which last month canceled its Jan. 27 protest plans amid
outcries at a spate of skinhead violence.
</P>
<P>
   At least three people have been killed in right-wing attacks
this year, prompting calls for a crackdown on neo-Nazis. The
government is due to report next month on whether it will pursue an
NPD ban.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, police said they had seized about 6,400 CDs and more
than 30,000 CD covers, videos, numerous posters with swastikas and
other items from the skinhead music scene.
</P>
<P>
   Police in the eastern states of Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia
raided 11 stores and apartments in the cities of Halle and Weimar
where the materials were confiscated, police said. German media
called it the biggest seizure of such material this year in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   In the northern town of Neumuenster, meanwhile, authorities shut
down a restaurant advertised on the Internet as a meeting point for
neo-Nazis, mayor Hartmut Unterlehburg said Tuesday. Town
authorities said they withdrew Club 88's license and ordered it
shuttered because its holder was actively promoting the restaurant
as a center for illegal right-wing activities.
</P>
<P>
   ''The closure is necessary and right,'' said Heide Simonis,
governor of Schleswig-Holstein state, which includes Neumuenster.
</P>
<P>
   About 400 right-wing extremists marched in the town Saturday
against the closure of Club 88. Neo-Nazis use the number eight as a
stand-in for H, the eighth letter of the alphabet, to get around a
ban on Nazi slogans in public. The 88 stands for HH, or ''Heil
Hitler.''

<HEADLINE> Tycoon Sought in Alleged Russia Plot  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Prosecutors have launched a nationwide search for
a tycoon suspected of planning to assassinate a prominent governor
and former presidential candidate, security officials said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mikhail Zhivilo, director of the MIKOM conglomerate, had fought
with Gov. Aman Tuleyev over control of lucrative aluminum plants in
the Kemerovo region in western Siberia. Tuleyev is governor of the
Kemerovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Security Service, or FSB, said last month it had
foiled an assassination plot against Tuleyev and summoned Zhivilo
for questioning, but he did not appear.
</P>
<P>
   The FSB branch in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk has issued an
arrest warrant for Zhivilo, a spokesman for the agency said
Wednesday without elaborating. Zhivilo's whereabouts were unclear,
though some Russian news reports said he has been out of the
country for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   MIKOM officials said the case against Zhivilo was groundless and
suggested it was linked to recent disputes in the aluminum
industry, state-controlled ORT television reported Wednesday. MIKOM
offices in Moscow could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Zhivilo is the second high-profile figure linked to the case.
Four-time Olympic biathlon champion Alexander Tikhonov was detained
last month on suspicion of helping arrange to poison Tuleyev and is
being held in Moscow's Lefortovo prison.
</P>
<P>
   Tuleyev, who came in fourth in March presidential elections,
said the plot to kill him appeared linked to control of the metals
industry, one of the most lucrative and allegedly crime-ridden
sectors of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The governor once sent police into one of MIKOM's steel mills to
oust a top manager. Tuleyev's administration also declared three
plants owned by MIKOM bankrupt earlier this year and assigned
representatives from the rival Siberian Aluminum conglomerate to
take over.

<HEADLINE> Mild Quake Shakes Northwest Turkey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- A mild earthquake shook northwestern
Turkey on Wednesday -- an aftershock of a massive temblor that
devastated the same region a year ago, the Kandilli observatory
said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no reports of damage or injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The quake struck the town of Yalova at 5:23 p.m. It was felt in
Istanbul, some 30 miles to the north, across from the Sea of
Marmara. Seismologists at Kandilli said it was an aftershock of the
7.4-magnitude quake that struck on Aug. 17, 1999, killing some
17,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Turkey lies on the active Anatolian fault.

<HEADLINE> Report: Separatists Targeted Judge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Police believe Basque separatist gunmen
planned to shoot renowned Judge Baltasar Garzon from a window
overlooking his office last month, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Citing confidential sources, El Pais said an informer told
police that the Basque separatist group ETA planned to send a
sniper to shoot Garzon from an apartment with a clear view of his
office in the National Court.
</P>
<P>
   Garzon, known for overseeing operations against ETA's
fund-raising as well as for his efforts to extradite former Chilean
dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet to Spain, offered to continue work
as normal to bait the gunmen for arrest, the newspaper reported.
Instead, police boosted security in the area and replaced Garzon's
office windows with bulletproof glass.
</P>
<P>
   ETA has claimed responsibility for eight killings this summer in
its fight for independence of the northern Spanish Basque region.
Since ending a 14-month cease-fire in December, it has claimed 11
killings and been blamed for a 12th.

<HEADLINE> Emmy Tries for Luster With Shandling  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- This weekend's Emmy ceremony could end up one
of the most engaging in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, many readers may be scratching their heads in an
attempt to uncover Emmy memories for comparison's sake. Last year's
show was the lowest-rated Emmy broadcast in nearly a decade,
drawing about 17 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   About 19 million people watched in 1998, not much more
impressive considering the 51 million viewers who tuned in to the
''Survivor'' finale or the audience of about 46 million that saw
the Academy Awards last March.
</P>
<P>
   ''Survivor'' boasted the wily future millionaire Richard Hatch
as a chief attraction. The Oscars have the allure of really
well-dressed movie stars and the freshness of a different slate of
contenders each time around.
</P>
<P>
   What are the Emmys doing, short of stranding the nominees on a
distant island in designer outfits or refusing to let shows and
performers acquire trophies in bulk by competing year after year?
</P>
<P>
   First off, this year's host is the reliably witty Garry
Shandling, star of the late, great ''The Larry Sanders Show.'' He
could single-handedly rescue what tends to be a dreary three-hour
parade of the actors we usually see on television anyway.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to preparation and hard work, Shandling seems to
be emulating Oscar king Billy Crystal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've never had a host put so much effort and commitment into
hosting the Emmys,'' said Don Mischer, executive producer of the
52nd Annual Primetime Emmy ceremony (airing at 8 p.m. EDT Sunday on
ABC).
</P>
<P>
   Shandling, who has worked weekends pre-taping comedy bits and
polishing his opening monologue, also has the advantage of a
stand-up comic's poise.
</P>
<P>
   ''During the course of the show, he'll be very quick on his
feet, he'll be able to roll with the punches,'' Mischer said. ''As
things happen, we'll write new stuff for him right away -- when
you're in my shoes producing a show, that's a tremendous
advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   ''And Gary loves television,'' he added. ''I think we're going
to have irreverence, but under the irreverence will be an obvious
love of television and a very positive attitude toward the Emmys.''
</P>
<P>
   Good, all good. This year's show also offers the chance to
observe Emmy history being made with a voting experiment aimed at
opening the winner's circle up a bit wider.
</P>
<P>
   The Academy of Television Arts &AMP; Sciences abandoned its longtime
''blue ribbon'' judging panels that required members to sequester
themselves in a hotel for a weekend of watching the nominated
shows.
</P>
<P>
   That approach tended to draw older academy members with more
free time. The new system, with videocassettes available for home
viewing, is aimed at bringing in more diverse voters who might be
friendlier to cutting-edge shows like ''The Sopranos.'' HBO's
critically acclaimed mob drama was nearly snubbed at last year's
ceremony, drawing just two big awards (best actress for Edie Falco
and best writing for a drama).
</P>
<P>
   One element remains unchanged: Acting nominees are judged not on
an entire season's worth of work but on the single episode they
feel represents their best effort. For comedy and drama series
contenders, eight episodes are considered.
</P>
<P>
   The big showdown is between NBC's political drama ''The West
Wing'' and ''The Sopranos,'' which will go head-to-head in six
categories, including best drama and best actor (Martin Sheen for
''West Wing,'' James Gandolfini for ''Sopranos'').
</P>
<P>
   ''Sopranos'' also is competing in the best dramatic actress
category with bids for co-stars Falco and Lorraine Bracco.
</P>
<P>
   ''West Wing'' begins the evening with a numerical advantage,
having received four creative arts Emmys at a ceremony held two
weeks ago to dispense the bulk of Emmy trophies. Twenty-seven major
awards will be given Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is convinced they will go to the most deserving.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas O'Neil, author of the history ''Variety's The Emmys,''
has publicly criticized the academy for abandoning the voting
panels, which he said made the Emmys unique in guaranteeing that
judges actually saw what they were voting on.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we see a disconnect between the performances on tape and
the voting outcome on Sunday,'' O'Neil said, ''it will tell us that
the voters did not see the tapes and that the Emmys are about buzz
and popularity and things other than the best performance of the
year.''
</P>
<P>
   One category, best actress in a comedy series, could reveal
whether the new system works, O' Neil said. Based on the submitted
episodes, Patricia Heaton of ''Everybody Loves Raymond'' should
triumph for her portrayal of a woman on the verge of a monthly
nervous breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Heaton's episode is such a fireworks display that it
clearly outshone all the others,'' said O'Neil. ''I think under the
old system, there's no way it could lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Other superior performances include those of Dennis Franz,
railing against God for his son's illness in ''NYPD Blue''; Sela
Ward as a woman facing divorce and dating in the pilot for ''Once
and Again''; and John Lithgow romping at a gay bar he believes
harbors fellow space aliens in ''3rd Rock From the Sun.''
</P>
<P>
   Will they be winners Sunday? Will viewers? Emmy's got a lot
riding on the answers.

<HEADLINE> Missing British Woman Alarms Japan  </HEADLINE>
By GARY SCHAEFER
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Where's Lucie Blackman?
</P>
<P>
   In the three months since the 22-year-old British woman
vanished, tens of thousands of posters have gone up around Tokyo,
her family has made tearful pleas on national television, and even
British Prime Minister Tony Blair has expressed concern.
</P>
<P>
   Blackman's disappearance, the most talked about missing-person
case this country has had in years, is gripping Japan because it
touches on sensitive social issues, from an influx of foreign
workers to the rise in street crime and the dangers of cults --
which were initially suspected of harboring her.
</P>
<P>
   But above all, it has become a cause celebre because of
something women's rights campaigners have long sought to highlight
-- the dangers of Japan's ''water trade,'' an often shadowy industry
built around nightclubs and bars where women like Blackman pour
drinks and provide companionship for men willing to pay upward of
$100 an hour for the service.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hear a lot of stories of abuse, mostly from women from
Asian countries who are smuggled in,'' said Keiko Otsu, who runs a
women's shelter in Tokyo called HELP. ''What's behind it all is the
mentality in this country that it's normal for men to buy women.''
</P>
<P>
   The job of hostess in Japan is an updated, dumbed-down version
of the role played by the geisha since the 17th century. While
being a geisha involved years of training in music, dance and
etiquette, hostess work mostly requires good looks and -- preferably
-- a knack for risque conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the women's services -- keeping the client's glass filled,
lighting his cigarettes and laughing at his jokes -- are valued in a
culture where entertaining at home is uncommon, and they provide
the backdrop for the sealing of countless business deals.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not easy work,'' said 20-year-old Lisa Lithero, a British
college student spending her summer vacation pouring bourbon at a
hostess club in Tokyo. ''If a customer doesn't speak English or
he's just boring, it can be really tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackman, a former flight attendant for British Airways, came to
Japan in May on a three-month tourist visa, speaking no Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   She rented a cheap apartment with a friend and began working
with her at a club in Roppongi, a popular Tokyo entertainment
district. According to her father, she planned to use her earnings
to travel on to Australia.
</P>
<P>
   But after telling her friend she was going to meet a man who had
promised to buy her a mobile phone, she vanished on July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Police acknowledge they have few clues.
</P>
<P>
   ''This sort of thing can happen in any country,'' said Inspector
Toshihiko Mii.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the case has shocked many in Japan and prompted a very
high-profile search.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30,000 leaflets bearing a photo of Blackman in a
cocktail dress have been distributed around Tokyo, and her family
is offering $150,000 for information leading to her discovery.
Blair asked about the status of the search when he was in Japan for
a summit in late July.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe it is quite unlikely that one individual has held
Lucie for such a substantial amount of time,'' Lucie's younger
sister, Sophie, told reporters last month. ''We feel that perhaps
there is something more like a group of people or an
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   She won't say what sort of group she means. At first suspicion
fell on some sort of cult, but Blackman says the family has ruled
out that theory.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what her fate, Lucie's case is unlikely to put off
women searching for fast cash; Western hostesses can earn nearly
$5,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Westerners represent only a small fraction of the hostesses.
Most are from Asian countries, or from as far away as Colombia and
Romania, where women pay criminal syndicates for fake passports or
paper marriages, incurring debts that may take years to pay off.
</P>
<P>
   And in the less respectable clubs, where gangsters procure and
keep the women, the line between hostessing and prostitution is
often nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the high-profile investigation into Blackman's
disappearance, their plight attracts little attention.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are Thai parents who are looking for their daughters in
Japan,'' said HELP's Otsu. ''But you never hear about them.''

<HEADLINE> Latin America Courts Show Power  </HEADLINE>
By WILL WEISSERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- A little-known judge is to decide Thursday
whether ex-dictator Efrain Rios Montt and 19 other ruling-party
lawmakers should be booted out of Guatemala's Congress and stripped
of immunity in a scandal over a tax on alcoholic drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his decision, the moment highlights the increasing
power of courts in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, military governments and internal conflicts
intimidated and controlled judiciaries across the region, leaving
courts impotent and many officials above the law.
</P>
<P>
   But suddenly, Latin America's courts appear to be coming into
their own.
</P>
<P>
   In Chile last month, the Supreme Court removed the legal
immunity of ex-dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet, who once bragged
that ''not so much as a leaf moves in Chile without me moving it.''
The action opens the possibility of a trial on charges of violating
human rights.
</P>
<P>
   In Argentina, a federal judge has deepened his investigation
into a bribery scandal in the Senate that threatens the
government's efforts to put a sluggish economy back on track.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, the Supreme Court recently ordered outgoing President
Ernesto Zedillo to give Congress bank documents that could show
illegal contributions to his 1994 campaign, overruling the
executive's claim it would violate banking secrecy laws.
</P>
<P>
   In Guatemala, an army of lawyers is scrambling to save the
political career of Rios Montt, a former military leader who later
founded Guatemala's majority political party. Rios Montt, 73,
became president of the unicameral legislature and helped propel
his protege, President Alfonso Portillo, into office in January.
</P>
<P>
   In the other corner is Supreme Court Justice Augusto Eleazar
Lopez, a media-shy judge best known for his taste in snappy
designer suits. He was chosen to handle the case by the 12 other
Supreme Court justices, all of whom were appointed by Congress last
year, when it was controlled by the main opposition political
party. The Supreme Court is the highest in Guatemala after the
Court of Constitutionality.
</P>
<P>
   Such court cases could open the door to deeper judicial probes,
like the human rights battle now being waged in Chile. Mexico's new
president, Vicente Fox, has proposed a congressional ''Transparency
Commission'' to investigate past misdeeds and turn them over to the
courts.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a globalization of justice that is spilling over into
local courts in many of these countries,'' said Rachel Neild, a
senior analyst for the Washington Office on Latin America. ''The
rule of law does seem like it could rise above the political
obstacles for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   The courts' new aggressiveness applies mainly to high-profile
cases and hasn't yet spilled over into the day-to-day operations of
most Latin American judiciaries, which as a rule are still
inefficient, Byzantine systems dominated by strong executive
branches.
</P>
<P>
   And even in the headline-making cases, many feel the court
systems still have a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
   They believe it was Pinochet's arrest in London on a Spanish
court warrant that lit a fire under Chilean courts, which after
more than a decade of sluggishness ruled that he could be brought
to trial.
</P>
<P>
   While Argentina's courts struggle to unravel the bribery
scandal, the same Spanish court has charged 98 Argentine officers,
including 12 members of a former military junta, with genocide,
terrorism and torture.
</P>
<P>
   The Guatemalan scandal is about something much less weighty:
booze. Congress last month set the tax on alcoholic beverages at 20
percent. Somehow it was published into law as just 10 percent.
Opposition leaders accuse Rios Montt of secretly altering the
figure in exchange for favors from the alcohol lobby.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is not lost on many human rights activists that Rios
Montt, a man who has never apologized for championing a
scorched-earth campaign that left tens of thousands of Indian
peasants dead during his 1982-83 rule, might be toppled by
something as mundane as a tax on drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated with the past inaction of Guatemala's courts, Nobel
peace laureate Rigoberta Menchu went to Spain's National Court in
December to file genocide charges against Rios Montt and others.
</P>
<P>
   ''The legal process we are seeing now in Guatemala is
encouraging,'' Menchu said recently of the tax scandal. ''But our
cause looks to hold these men responsible for their truly terrible
crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Seils, legal director of Guatemala City's Center for Human
Rights Legal Action, who is preparing a genocide case against Rios
Montt in Guatemala, said the Latin American court systems have to
start somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ''Should Rios Montt be stripped of his immunity, it opens up
doors that I don't think we expected to be opened anytime soon,''
Seils said. ''If that happens, he will have tripped up on an issue
that is not that big a deal, but the fact will remain that he will
be more vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Neild said that if Pinochet could face charges in the country he
ruled with an iron fist for 17 years, anyone, anywhere in Latin
America, could one day be forced to face justice.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pinochet was such a symbolic figure, doing everything he did
in such a way as to never get caught,'' she said. ''Whatever
happens in Chile now will send a kind of shock wave through the
region that we have not seen before.''

<HEADLINE> Protein ID'd As Alzheimer's Pathway  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM McCALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   A newly identified protein that may be essential to early
development and maintenance of the brain and other cells may also
contribute to Alzheimer's disease late in life.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's rather poetic, really -- what makes you in the first
place, sort of does you in,'' said Peter St. George-Hyslop of the
University of Toronto, who reported the finding in Thursday's issue
of the journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   The protein, which St. George-Hyslop and fellow Canadian
researchers named nicastrin, binds itself to another protein,
called presenilin, which is suspected of triggering the formation
of deadly plaques, or buildups, in brain cells, causing
Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   Nicastrin may also play a role in early fetal development by
helping to determine how cells specialize into many forms, such as
muscle, skin and brain cells.
</P>
<P>
   Proteins typically have very specific functions, such as
proteins that act as enzymes or hormones. Many simply cut or
assemble other proteins into larger structures, and nicastrin may
play that role with presenilin, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is tragic indeed that this process might contribute to
Alzheimer's disease in our old age,'' said Dale Schenk of Elan
Pharmaceuticals in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In an accompanying commentary on the Canadian research, Schenk
said the study could help lead to a new drug to slow or halt the
progression of Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   The DNA in every living cell is coded to create amino acids that
are linked together in chains called proteins. The more complex the
protein, generally the larger the chain is.
</P>
<P>
   St. George-Hyslop and his group purified the presenilin protein
and found two types of other proteins that bound themselves to
presenilin and made it larger. One of the two smaller types of
proteins was already known, but the second had not previously been
identified.
</P>
<P>
   It was named nicastrin for the Italian village of Nicastro,
where a pioneering study on Alzheimer's was done in the 1960s with
an extended family suffering from the disease.
</P>
<P>
   After identifying nicastrin, St. George-Hyslop and his team
altered the genes of fruit flies, worms and mice to control for the
amount of nicastrin produced.
</P>
<P>
   They found they could either decrease or increase the main
ingredient of Alzheimer's plaque by altering nicastrin levels.
</P>
<P>
   But they also found nicastrin plays a fundamental role in
natural protein synthesis early in life.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is part of the molecular machinery that is important
because it evolved over billions of years,'' St. George-Hyslop
said. ''But it's also involved in generation of the protein that
causes Alzheimer's disease.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 94; Nasdaq Loses 90  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue chip stocks moved higher Wednesday, boosted
by news of a major deal in the financial services industry and
surging oil prices, but high-tech stocks declined after analysts
downgraded their ratings on several high-profile companies.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said a government report on higher U.S. productivity
and a new low for the euro currency overseas helped boost big-name
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 83.98 at 11,344.59.
</P>
<P>
   But the high-tech driven Nasdaq composite index was off 90.46 at
4,052.72. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 8.03 at
1,499.05.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup, the nation's biggest financial services company, said
it will buy lending company Associates First Capital for about
$31.1 billion in stock. The deal should speed Citigroup's global
expansion in lending to consumers, giving it control of the U.S.'s
largest publicly traded finance company and Japan's fifth largest
consumer finance company.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup, a Dow component, fell $2.75 to $55.19 in afternoon
trading, but shares of Associates First Capital jumped $11.06, or
nearly 40 percent, to $39.06.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Labor Department said Americans' productivity, a
key measure of rising living standards, surged at a 5.7 percent
annual rate in the second quarter. The strong gain pushed unit
labor costs, a key gauge of inflation pressures, down by a rate of
0.4 percent, the lowest since the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The report bolstered investors' belief that interest rates will
remain stable for the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, the euro fell to near 87 cents, smashing through last
Thursday's previous low of 88.37 cents. The currency also fell to a
new low against the yen, falling to 93.00 yen from its previous
benchmark of 93.76 yen.
</P>
<P>
   Although the downturn could hurt U.S. companies with European
investments, it could also translate into a boost for U.S.
financial markets as investors who previously put their money into
European exchanges look for other places to invest.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Wednesday in London, prices of Brent crude for delivery
in October hit a new 10-year high, rising to $33.50 a barrel. Crude
for delivery in October surpassed the previous 10-year high of
$34.37 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, reaching $34.45 before
declining somewhat to $34.35. Higher oil prices are considered by
some to be a potential inflationary pressure, but at least one
analyst wasn't worried.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this truly was a long-term inflationary threat, that would
be showing up at the bond market in the form of higher interest
rates and we don't see that happening,'' said Alan Skrainka, chief
market strategist at Edward Jones of St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Tech stocks were depressed for a second day by analyst
downgrades of prominent companies.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Micron Technology fell $8.06 to $70.19 after
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette lowered its rating on the memory
chipmaker from ''buy'' to ''underperform.'' Shares of
telecommunications chipmaker Applied Microcircuits were down $8.31
at $181.50.
</P>
<P>
   And telecom giant WorldCom fell $2.19 to $31.56 after analysts
from Lehman Brothers and Wachovia Securities downgraded the stock.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, high-tech stocks declined after a Piper Jaffray
analyst lowered the investment firm's rating on Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues narrowly led decliners on the New York Stock
Exchange. Volume came to 671.17 million shares, compared to 559.00
million the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 2.41 at 536.61.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Prepares for Election  </HEADLINE>
By DIRK BEVERIDGE
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG (AP) -- Call it partial democracy that generates a lot
of griping.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong selects a new legislature on Sunday, in a system
critics say is rigged to give pro-Beijing forces and businesses
undue power. Still, a minority of seats are expected to go to a
vocal opposition that loudly attacks Hong Kong's political leader,
Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa, as it clamors for more democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The big pro-Beijing party also heads into the election hurt by
an influence-peddling scandal that it admits will weaken its
victory.
</P>
<P>
   At stake are all 60 seats in the Legislative Council. Ordinary
voters get to cast ballots for 24. Thirty are chosen by special
interest groups -- such as businesses, lawyers, doctors, teachers --
and six more are picked by a committee.
</P>
<P>
   If it sounds confusing, it is, according to critics who say the
system is designed to preserve power for the government run by
Tung, Beijing's choice to control Hong Kong after its handover from
British sovereignty three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't call the executive into account,'' said legislator
Christine Loh, who didn't seek re-election because she felt
frustrated at the lack of legislative power and thought she could
galvanize public opinion more effectively as a commentator.
</P>
<P>
   ''It preserves a 19th century colonial model of government,
where you have concentrated power at the top,'' Loh said. ''It's
gone past its sell-by date.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Chinese sovereignty, Hong Kong operates as a so-called
''Special Administrative Region'' with considerable autonomy and
different legal and political systems from those in mainland China.
</P>
<P>
   The territory's mini-constitution calls for transition to a
system where ordinary voters could choose all 60 lawmakers, but
there is no timetable.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Lee, the head of the opposition Democratic Party and a
candidate for re-election, sees no short-term changes though he
holds out optimism for a more democratic Hong Kong in the long
term, if the opposition keeps making enough noise.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can monitor the government and we can ask nasty
questions,'' Lee said. ''So long as the press remains free, then we
can certainly embarrass the government. No way we can remove it or
throw it out.''
</P>
<P>
   The race has had its colorful moments: One candidate campaigned
in a pink Superman suit and there is a long-haired longshot who
wants to oust the Hong Kong government and end the Communist
Party's rule of China.
</P>
<P>
   But things turned nastier than expected when a sensationalistic
Chinese newspaper dropped a bombshell on the Democratic Alliance
for the Betterment of Hong Kong, a pro-Beijing party whose core of
supporters has grown steadily.
</P>
<P>
   The DAB vice chairman, Gary Cheng, came under fire for leaking
confidential government documents to a client of his public
relations business and was forced to give up his party post.
</P>
<P>
   The party would like to ax him as a candidate, but it can't.
Cheng appears at the top of its slate of candidates -- so he's
likely to be elected although his indiscretions will hurt the
party.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's some flaws in the election system,'' groused the
party's secretary general, Ma Lik, also a local deputy to the
National People's Congress in Beijing. ''The system does not allow
people to withdraw.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the scandal, Ma had hoped for 30 percent of the popular
vote and 13 seats in Legco, as the Legislative Council is known.
Now, he's scaling back his targets to 25 percent of the vote and 10
or 11 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Lau Siu-kai, an analyst at Chinese University, said the
Democrats and the pro-business Liberal Party are unlikely to pick
up much of what the DAB loses.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, more of Hong Kong's 3 million voters will stay home,
and the fallout will thwart the DAB's efforts to gain middle-class
support in coming years, he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ''This problem of the morality of politicians, this problem of
conflict of interest, these are the issues that will pop up after
the election,'' Law said.
</P>
<P>
   After lawmakers are seated in October, the opposition will
confront Tung's government with demands for an inquiry into charges
that a top aide, Andrew Lo, testified untruthfully in a probe into
allegations a university pollster was told to stop surveying Tung's
low popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Lo has denied the charge, made by a University of Hong Kong
investigative panel that heard more than two weeks of testimony.

<HEADLINE> American in Peru Describes Prison  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The American woman convicted in a Peruvian
military court of treason said in a 1&AMP;frac12;-year-old interview from
prison that she had seen fellow inmates tortured.
</P>
<P>
   The interview of Lori Berenson was broadcast for the first time
Wednesday. Reporter Amy Goodman, who visited Berenson in March 1999
with a U.S. human rights delegation, said the interview broadcast
on Pacifica Radio was kept secret because of fears for Berenson's
safety.
</P>
<P>
   Berenson, 30, of New York, was convicted in 1996 on charges of
helping the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement plan an attack on
Peru's Congress. Peruvian officials recently granted her a new
trial by a civil court and moved her from Socabaya Prison to a
prison in Lima.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman said Berenson's lawyers and parents had screened the
excerpts.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt at this point it would be safer to air it now after
she's moved out of the Socabaya prison and into Lima,'' Goodman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking 18 months before Peru voided her conviction and granted
the new trial, Berenson insisted she was innocent and said she
thought it would be impossible to get a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''With ... such negative publicity that I've had in Peru, I
would never get a fair trial,'' Berenson said.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Berenson complained about the cold in a prison
in Yanamayo, high in the Andes Mountains, where she was held for
three years before being transferred to Socabaya. She said her
''health has failed in jail,'' but added that other inmates were in
much worse shape.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman said Berenson told her she had seen some of them
tortured and that some had been killed, although she was unsure
whether Berenson had actually witnessed any deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Berenson said that a month after she was arrested, a woman with
five bullet wounds was placed in her cell.
</P>
<P>
   ''They had left her on a dirty mattress, naked,'' Berenson said.
''Probably with a shirt on or something. A filthy mattress with
five open wounds, which is pretty horrendous. I mean, there were
rats in my bed and things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Peruvian Mission to the United Nations did not immediately
return a call seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Defines Its Political Role  </HEADLINE>
By ZEINA KARAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- After years of battling Israeli troops in
south Lebanon, the Hezbollah guerrilla movement now looks set to
play an significant role in Lebanese politics after voters rewarded
the ''party of God'' with gains in parliament elections this week.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah, treated as heroes by many Lebanese after Israel's May
24 withdrawal from the south after two decades of occupation, has
said little since about its political agenda, but is talking about
focusing on the social services they're already providing to their
Shiite Muslim constituency.
</P>
<P>
   In voting Sunday in south Lebanon, the Bekaa Valley and Beirut,
Hezbollah increased its delegates in the 128-member legislature
from seven to nine -- with three Hezbollah-backed candidates also
winning seats.
</P>
<P>
   ''They (Hezbollah) are hardworking. They gave us their blood.
The least we could do is reward them for their heroic efforts,''
said Hassan Abu Abbas, 32, a Shiite butcher from Khiam village who
voted Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah's deputy secretary-general Naim Kassem insisted
Tuesday that with its political gains the party was not forsaking
its role as ''protector'' of Lebanon's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah said the movement would
unleash rockets on northern Israeli towns if Israel tried to move
back across the border.
</P>
<P>
   Kassem told reporters Tuesday the election victory was ''an
added responsibility.'' Hezbollah will now strive ''toward
developing the deprived liberated areas ... and achieving social
equality in all regions'' of Lebanon, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Israeli withdrawal, Hezbollah has provided services,
such as water and health care, that the Lebanese government was
slow to supply in the former occupied enclave.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim al-Amin, an analyst with the daily As-Safir, said
Hezbollah, which is backed by Syria and Iran, was still a regional
player.
</P>
<P>
   ''If a serious and effective Palestinian resistance (to Israel)
is launched inside the Palestinian areas and the Palestinians
enlist Hezbollah's help, I don't think they would balk,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Amin noted that Hezbollah's support at the polls came even
though the guerrilla movement has said little about their political
goals.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hezbollah is probably the only group to draw up a political
program after elections, not before,'' said . He noted, however,
that Hezbollah had little time for platform writing between the
Israeli pullout and parliamentary elections, which were held in two
stages on Aug. 27 and Sept. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Amid said Hezbollah's increasing popularity could give it a seat
in the next Cabinet for the first time. ''It is possible,'' he
said, ''unless the new government intends to put peace with Israel
on its agenda for the coming stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Kassem said Hezbollah would consider an offer of a Cabinet post,
if it were made, but would not necessarily accept it. The group
apparently has already learned not to reveal too much in the game
of politics.
</P>
<P>
   While enthusiastic Shiite guerrilla supporters streamed to the
polls, the atmosphere among Christians in the former
Israeli-occupied zone in the south, where they are a minority, was
more subdued. Most chose to stay away from the voting.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't seen anything, good or bad, from anyone,'' said
Malek, a 40-year-old Christian school teacher in Marjayoun who gave
only his first name. ''We've been cut off, forgotten for so long.
Why should I vote for anyone specific?''
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah showed political savvy in the elections, teaming up
with its traditional rival, the Amal guerrilla group, to forge an
election coalition headed by Amal chief Nabih Berri. The ticket
swept all 23 parliamentary seats allotted for south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance ensured that neither group would emerge as dominant
among Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiite Muslims but also meant that
Hezbollah and Amal voters did not cancel out each others' ballots,
which would have benefitted other parties.
</P>
<P>
   The last time that residents of the former Israeli-occupied zone
voted was in the 1972 parliamentary elections. There were no
elections in Lebanon during the country's 1975-90 civil war and
parliamentary polls in 1992 and 1996 did not include the border
areas because of the Israeli occupation.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Addresses China-Taiwan Issue  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators threatened Wednesday to bring
''legislative action'' against China unless the mainland agrees not
to block Taiwan's entry into the World Trade Organization. But they
didn't say what the action might be.
</P>
<P>
   As the bill to normalize trade with China went into its second
day of debate by the full Senate, members of the Foreign Relations
Committee held a separate hearing suggesting the bill might be
amended to force China's cooperation on the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think ... Congress ought to go ahead and do something,''
said committee chairman Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we ought to stand up for Taiwan now.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Craig Thomas argued against an amendment to the China
trade bill, saying it would delay passage.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we need to find a way to get that message'' to China
without holding up the trade legislation, said the Wyoming
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Senators were referring to Beijing's proposal in late July that
the document setting out terms for membership in the WTO make it
clear Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau are all part of China -- in effect
use the WTO to assert its disputed claim to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing proposed that Taiwan be called ''a separate customs
territory of China,'' said Sen. John Kyl, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton told Kyl in an Aug. 31 letter made public at
the hearing that his administration has warned China about the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have advised the Chinese that such language is
inappropriate ... and that we will not accept it,'' the letter
said.
</P>
<P>
   Senators said they were looking for ways to back the
administration if China doesn't withdraw its proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should hold out the prospect of legislative action,'' said
Kyl.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement signed in 1992, once China joins the WTO,
Taiwan would immediately follow. Hong Kong is already a member as
it is treated as a separate customs territory.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a just world,'' Helms said, Taiwan would have been admitted
long ago to the 137-member trade organization because it is more
advanced economically than China and has for years met the
requirements for membership.
</P>
<P>
   China trade was the first order of business Tuesday as the
Senate returned from its summer recess with leaders of both parties
determined to approve the permanent normalized trade relations
(PNTR) before lawmakers close shop to campaign before the November
elections.
</P>
<P>
   While supporters believe they have a solid majority in the
Senate, they face two main problems -- time limitations as Congress
rushes to finish its work for the year and the determination of
some senators to link normalized trade to China's record on weapons
proliferation and human rights.
</P>
<P>
   The House in May approved the China trade bill on a 237-197
vote, and the concern is that any Senate amendments to that bill
would effectively kill it for the year because there wouldn't be
time for the two chambers to work out differences between the
measures.
</P>
<P>
   As the full Senate debated the bill Wednesday, Sen. Max Baucus,
D-Mont., urged support of the bill, saying rejection of PNTR will
likely lead to an indefinite delay in Taiwan's entry into the WTO.
------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 4444.

<HEADLINE> Debate on Berlin Palace Intensifies  </HEADLINE>
By BURT HERMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Glass-sheathed skyscrapers went up in the former
no man's land of the Berlin Wall faster than anyone had imagined.
But it's a palace whose cornerstone was laid in 1443 that's
generating the most architectural angst in the reunited German
capital.
</P>
<P>
   The palace isn't even there anymore, at least not the one the
Kaisers lived in. East Germany started dismantling the baroque
building, which was damaged in World War II, 50 years ago Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The question that divides east and west Berliners today is
whether to rebuild the Berlin City Palace or keep the ''Palace of
the Republic,'' the socialist-realist parliament building erected
in its place.
</P>
<P>
   A federal commission is being formed this fall under orders from
the Cabinet to settle the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   It took about four months in 1950 to reduce the immense palace
to dust and make space for the smaller parliament building and a
marching ground intended to handle 800,000 communist flag-wavers.
The destruction was condemned by preservationists as an
''incomprehensible'' act of ''cold-blooded murder,'' but the
communist leaders insisted all the fuss would die out quickly.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the fall of the Wall, backers of reconstruction have
been pushing to restore the old palace, home to Prussian kings and
once the central feature in Berlin's architecture at the other end
of the stately Unter den Linden boulevard from the Brandenburg
Gate.
</P>
<P>
   ''To complete the old center would give back to the people a
piece of identity,'' said Wilhelm von Boddien, head of the group
pushing for a rebuilt palace. The new building, to contain a
cultural center, museum and office space, would cost an estimated
$523 million.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, whose temporary office overlooks
the empty square and the crumbling parliament building, has offered
moral support.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I had to express a wish, then I'd be for the palace,''
Schroeder said last year. ''And that's simply because it's
beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet a counter-campaign has been formed to save the East German
''Palace of the Republic,'' which is undergoing asbestos removal
that should be completed by late next year. More than just home to
the rubber-stamp parliament, the building was a place where East
Germans could celebrate weddings, go bowling and enjoy cultural
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should let the people keep this possession,'' said
Lieselotte Schulz, chairwoman of the Society for the Preservation
of the Palast der Republik, who recalls sipping coffee with friends
and hearing Beethoven's Ninth Symphony in the building. ''We don't
have a Kaiser. The palace would just be a memorial, a
reconstruction and not a real palace anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Von Boddien counters that the East German building, a box-like
construction with copper-tinted windows, is just ugly.
</P>
<P>
   Architecture critics have compared it to what one finds ''on the
way to any American airport,'' he says. Besides, the palace won't
cost that much more than any other plans for the space, he insists.
</P>
<P>
   Roland Kratt, who was reading the informational panels erected
on the empty square by reconstruction boosters, said he would
support keeping both old and new.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we need a historic symbol in the city center to remind
us of our past,'' said Kratt, a businessman from Sauerland. ''But
nothing too big or too expensive though.''

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Falls 102; Dow Rises 50  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Tech stocks fell for a second straight session
Wednesday as analysts cut their ratings on several high-profile
companies. Blue chips moved higher, boosted by news of a major deal
in the financial services industry and surging oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also said a government report on higher U.S.
productivity and a new low for the euro currency overseas helped
boost big-name stocks.
</P>
<P>
   In late afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 49.94 at 11,310.55.
</P>
<P>
   But the high-tech driven Nasdaq composite index was off 102.16
at 4,041.02. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 9.82 at
1,497.26.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup, the nation's biggest financial services company, said
it will buy lending company Associates First Capital for about
$31.1 billion in stock. The deal should speed Citigroup's global
expansion in lending to consumers, giving it control of the U.S.'s
largest publicly traded finance company and Japan's fifth largest
consumer finance company.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup, a Dow component, fell $3.19 to $54.75 in afternoon
trading, but shares of Associates First Capital jumped $10.75,
nearly 39 percent, to $38.75.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Labor Department said Americans' productivity, a
key measure of rising living standards, surged at a 5.7 percent
annual rate in the second quarter. The strong gain pushed unit
labor costs, a key gauge of inflation pressures, down by a rate of
0.4 percent, the lowest since the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The report bolstered investors' belief that interest rates will
remain stable for the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, the euro fell to near 87 cents, smashing through last
Thursday's previous low of 88.37 cents. The currency also fell to a
new low against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   Although the downturn could hurt U.S. companies with European
investments, it could translate into a boost for U.S. financial
markets as investors who previously put their money into European
exchanges look for other places to invest.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Wednesday in London, prices of Brent crude for delivery
in October hit a new 10-year high, rising to $33.50 a barrel. Crude
for delivery in October surpassed the previous 10-year high of
$34.37 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, reaching $34.45 before
declining somewhat to $34.35. Higher oil prices are considered by
some to be a potential inflationary pressure, but at least one
analyst wasn't worried.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this truly was a long-term inflationary threat, that would
be showing up at the bond market in the form of higher interest
rates and we don't see that happening,'' said Alan Skrainka, chief
market strategist at Edward Jones of St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Tech stocks were depressed for a second day by analyst
downgrades of prominent companies.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Micron Technology fell $8.06 to $70.19 after
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette lowered its rating on the memory
chipmaker from ''buy'' to ''underperform.'' Shares of
telecommunications chipmaker Applied Microcircuits were down $8.31
at $181.50.
</P>
<P>
   And telecom giant WorldCom fell $2.19 to $31.56 after analysts
from Lehman Brothers and Wachovia Securities downgraded the stock.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, high-tech stocks declined after a Piper Jaffray
analyst lowered the investment firm's rating on Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange. Volume came to 787.78 million shares,
compared to 657.02 million the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 2.60 at 536.42.

<HEADLINE> Report: Shin Bet Seeks 1st Spokesman  </HEADLINE>
By RON KAMPEAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel's most shadowy security service is
reportedly seeking a little light.
</P>
<P>
   The Shin Bet -- its once awe-inspiring reputation battered by
reports of duplicity, excessive brutality and incompetence -- is
setting up a spokesman's office for the first time in its history,
Israel's Haaretz daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   No one would confirm the report -- the Shin Bet has no spokesman,
after all -- but a former agency director said the idea has been
around for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ''Much of the distortion, much of the harm that was caused the
Shin Bet and its employees would have been avoided'' had it hired a
spokesman, Yaakov Perry told Israel radio.
</P>
<P>
   Other intelligence agencies are more accessible to reporters:
the army spokesman handles calls for military intelligence, and the
foreign ministry occasionally comments on the activities of the
Mossad, Israel's external spy agency.
</P>
<P>
   But reporters seeking comment on Shin Bet internal security
activities are directed to the prime minister's office, and
officials there unfailingly refuse comment, as they did Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Shin Bet director Avi Dichter wants to name a spokesman from
within the agency's ranks and to hire a media adviser from outside,
Haaretz reported. In addition to answering journalists' questions,
the two would initiate ideas that would ''market'' the Shin Bet.
</P>
<P>
   That's a radical change for the agency charged with security in
Israel, the West Bank and Gaza, a service so secret that in the
1950s, the mainstream press did not even acknowledge its existence.
</P>
<P>
   Haolam Hazeh, a radical opposition magazine and then the only
periodical that dared report the agency's activities, referred to
it only as ''the apparatus of darkness.''
</P>
<P>
   The Shin Bet -- the Hebrew initials for Security Service --
developed a reputation as a force to be reckoned with, infiltrating
and identifying violent opposition groups almost from the state's
inception.
</P>
<P>
   That began to unravel in 1984, when its agents killed two
Palestinians who had tried to hijack a bus. Shin Bet agents said
the two were killed in crossfire. When a newspaper photo showed one
of the Palestinians in good health minutes after he was arrested,
agency officials forged documents in a plot to frame military
intelligence for the killings.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1987-93 Palestinian uprising, Shin Bet agents earned
a reputation as exceedingly brutal. Last year, the Supreme Court
ordered the agency to stop using ''physical pressure'' in
interrogations, a practice human rights groups have described as
torture.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Shin Bet agents assigned to protect Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin failed to prevent a Jewish ultranationalist known for
his hatred of Rabin from shooting the prime minister to death at
close range.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli journalist known for his portraits of Palestinian
victims of Shin Bet torture said the appointment of a spokesman was
long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would help me a lot,'' said Gideon Levy. ''On many
occasions, I would have liked (to report) the other side -- I'm sure
that in many cases they would have had responses, and they may even
have persuaded me.''

<HEADLINE> Democrats Accuse GOP on Census  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Investigations House Republicans have
requested of the Census Bureau are partisan ''roadblocks'' to the
progress of the once-a-decade count, congressional Democrats
charged Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite the roadblocks placed in its way, the Census has been
an operational success,'' said a letter from three House Democrats
to Speaker Dennis Hastert. ''As such, we demand that you finally
cease these senseless investigations so that the professionals can
finish their assigned jobs without further interruption.''
</P>
<P>
   Reps. Carolyn Maloney of New York, Carrie Meek of Florida, and
Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas signed the letter, which was
circulated among other Democratic members after a news conference
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The vigorous oversight ... is fully warranted,'' Rep. Dan
Miller, chairman of the House census subcommittee, responded in his
own letter in behalf of Hastert. ''It would be irresponsible to
write the Bureau a $6.5 billion check to conduct the census and
turn our backs, as you would have us do.''
</P>
<P>
   Maloney, the subcommittee's ranking Democrat, said Republicans
requested nearly 100 inquiries into census operations this year,
ranging from topics like data quality to cooperation with
overseers.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats, including Maloney and Meek, have asked for their
own investigations. Maloney said those were legitimate, isolated
requests, unlike the Republicans' ''barrage.''
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, Miller, R-Fla., asked the General Accounting
Office and other agencies to look into the Census Bureau's
involvement in a Los Angeles event -- tied to the Democratic
National Convention -- designed to mobilize black voters in the
upcoming election.
</P>
<P>
   Agency workers at the event were there only to educate and did
not act with partisan intentions, Census director Kenneth Prewitt
has said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said she was especially incensed that Miller would
question the event organized in part by a private citizen and one
of her constituents, nationally-syndicated radio talk show host Tom
Joyner.

<HEADLINE> BC-NY--Buffalo Teachers, 3rd Ld-Writethru,0420  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Buffalo's 47,000 public school students -
and their teachers - were back in the classroom Wednesday, after a
late-night round of contract talks proved successful enough to ward
off a threatened teachers strike.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders, however, left the door open for future action as
negotiations continued on a multiyear contract for the district's
3,800 teachers. They have been working under an expired pact since
June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''This does not mean that there still is not a crisis. Anything
can fall apart tomorrow,'' BTF President Philip Rumore said after
talks Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials scheduled a Wednesday evening meeting to discuss
the day's negotiations and determine whether teachers should
continue to report for work.
</P>
<P>
   With a $5.5 million strike fund in place, the teachers were
prepared to walk, even though state law prohibits them from
participating in strikes. In addition to losing pay, they could
face stiff fines.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to see the students out in the street but I think
we have to do what we have to do,'' McKinley High School teacher
Tom Mitchell said as he walked an informational picket line with
other teachers before heading into the classroom for the start of
school Wednesday. ''In the long run it's for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers likely would stage ''rotating strikes,'' in which all
of the teachers at randomly targeted schools fail to report to work
on specific days.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials said the contract offered by the board includes
no pay raise in the first year and increases of 1 percent, 2
percent, 1.5 percent and 2 percent in subsequent years. Teachers
also are being asked to work an extra two days a year and the board
wants retirees to accept a cut in health benefits, according to the
union.
</P>
<P>
   The School Board has declined to comment on the reported terms.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo teachers earn an average of $55,000 a year, district
spokesman Andrew Maddigan said, and three-quarters also receive
annual pay increments ranging from 1.5 percent to 5 percent,
depending on their levels of education and service to the district.
</P>
<P>
   While declining to comment on stumbling blocks, city officials
say a tight budget is the general problem. Adding to that is the
fact that the district is about to start making payments of $2
million a year to cover the cost of a lawsuit by teachers settled
for $73 million in March. That lawsuit stemmed from an earlier
contract dispute.

<HEADLINE> Russia Denies Torture Claim  </HEADLINE>
By NICK WADHAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian security officials acknowledged Wednesday
that they couldn't locate Chechnya's parliament speaker four months
after they arrested him, but denied claims by Chechen leaders that
he was tortured to death in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Ruslan Alikhadzhiyev, a leader in the rebel
republic, worries human rights groups because Russian officials
have released little information other than to confirm his arrest.
Even that confirmation came after repeated denials.
</P>
<P>
   Concern was heightened when Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov,
citing unidentified sources, claimed in a statement that
Alikhadzhiyev died in Moscow's Lefortovo prison several days ago
after being tortured.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a duty officer with Russia's Federal Security
Service said Alikhadzhiyev was detained in the Chechen town of
Shali in May but denied he was ever taken to Lefortovo. The duty
officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he could not
confirm that Alikhadzhiyev was still being held and maintained he
did not know where he was.
</P>
<P>
   The office of Russia's chief spokesman on Chechnya said
Wednesday it had no information on Alikhadzhiyev's whereabouts. The
Justice Ministry and the army command in Chechnya also said they
didn't know whether he was in custody.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only thing that is really clear is that this man was
detained,'' said Diederik Lohman, director of the Moscow office of
Human Rights Watch. ''That means that if the Russian authorities
cannot produce a credible story of his release, then they are
responsible to account for his whereabouts and his well-being.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides in the Chechen war have made exaggerated claims, and
it was impossible to independently confirm the reports about
Alikhadzhiyev. Alikhadzhiyev's relatives in Shali told The
Associated Press in August that they had found no trace of him
despite weeks of searching.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels in Chechnya, located in the Caucasus region in Russia's
south, drove Russian troops out of the republic in a 1994-96 war.
Russian troops returned a year ago to suppress separatist
guerrillas, and now controls large areas of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups have documented several cases when Chechens
disappeared after being detained by Russian troops. But the
disappearance of such a high-level official is unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Alikhadzhiyev is a member of a rebel legislature which was
elected before fighting began in Chechnya last September.
</P>
<P>
   He has advocated negotiations between the Kremlin and rebel
leaders. According to the Kommersant newspaper, he wrote a letter
to Russian President Vladimir Putin saying the Chechen parliament
was ready to help negotiate a solution to the latest conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Also in Chechnya, an Associated Press reporter was detained,
beaten and held in a covered pit overnight by Russian troops
sweeping the republic's capital for rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Reporter Ruslan Musayev, an ethnic Chechen, was buying food at
Grozny's central marketplace Tuesday when Russian troops stopped
him and demanded his documents.
</P>
<P>
   Musayev's passport does not show him as registered as a resident
of Grozny, so the servicemen took him to a military base at
Khankala. Musayev was not carrying documents identifying him as a
reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Musayev said he was then beaten, suffering multiple bruises and
damage to his lower ribs. He was led to a covered pit dug into the
ground, where he spent the night with four other detained Chechen
men.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning, an officer demanded to know what Musayev had
of value, Musayev said. Musayev turned over $600 he had hidden in
his clothing and his gold watch.
</P>
<P>
   He was then put on a military truck, taken to the border with
the neighboring Russian region of Ingushetia and released.

driver is struggling with directions and black clouds threaten to
wash out two Labor Day events before the Republican candidate for
Senate can reach them.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the confusion, Franks is a pillar of calm. Shoes off,
reclining in a center seat of his leased campaign van, he is

   ''Cool! Love you too, Sweetie,'' Franks says, signing off.
</P>
<P>
   Confident, relaxed and polished, Franks evinces no anxiety at
facing the most daunting challenge of his political career:
defeating Jon Corzine, the immensely wealthy Democrat who will
likely swamp Franks with self-financed television advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Franks, 48, is a true organization man, having served two stints
as chairman of New Jersey's Republican Party. Traveling the state
as an unlikely underdog, he exudes confidence that, come Election
Day, the machinery of politics will grind out a victory for him.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine is a first-time candidate but is running like an
incumbent, largely ignoring Franks and avoiding face-to-face
encounters.
</P>
<P>
   So Franks, a member of the House since 1993 and consummate
political insider, is the one portraying himself as the regular
guy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very much like most of the people who call New Jersey
home,'' says Franks - even though most people do not join the state
Legislature at age 28 and go on to win 10 elections in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Corzine, who keeps his family largely off-limits, Franks
posed with his wife and daughter for the front of a handbill
distributed at public events.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign van has a baby seat, stuffed toys and diapers in
the back for days when politicking is a family affair. The van is
equipped with television and VCR, and Franks often watches videos
of country music. Garth Brooks is a favorite.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign manager, Charlie Smith, says these phrases best
describe the candidate: Experienced. Hardworking. In touch.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign pace is busy, but not frantic. During a break after
South Plainfield's Labor Day parade, Franks nurses an iced tea and
a small glass of a New Jersey-brewed beer at an Irish pub while
quietly singing along with Bruce Springsteen's ''My Hometown.''
</P>
<P>
   On the street, Franks practices what might be called
cardio-campaigning. Along the parade route he jogs to one side of
the street, leaps the curb and shakes hands, then jogs to the other
side to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think politics has too often become a very impersonal
activity in America,'' Franks says.
</P>
<P>
   The banter with voters is one-sided and lacking in punctuation:
''Hi folks I'm Bob Franks I'm running for U.S. Senate have a
terrific day!''
</P>
<P>
   Halfway through the parade, Franks laughs when he sees his
friend Linda Dashuta, the Republican chairwoman of South
Plainfield, waving a bumper sticker popular among the anti-Corzine
crowd: ''Make him spend it all, Bob.''
</P>
<P>
   Franks says the bumper stickers are made by supporters, not by
the campaign. Still, ''I think they're funny,'' he says. ''They
have a wonderful undercurrent of truth to them.''
</P>
<P>
   When Daniel Sherwood of South Plainfield approaches Franks with
a direct question - ''Anti-gun or pro-gun?'' - Franks pauses, then
replies, ''I'm for the Second Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   ''OK, you've got my vote,'' says Sherwood, a gun owner and
member of the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   But elaborating minutes later on the gun issue, Franks boasts of
his vote in favor of the Brady Act and his support for closing the
so-called ''gun show loophole.'' The encounter is a reminder of one
common criticism of Franks through his years in Congress, that he
is pragmatic to the point of lacking a strong ideological compass.
</P>
<P>
   But the Senate race seems likely to turn less on Franks' record
in Congress than the precedent-setting spending of his Democratic
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, Corzine has hit the air with his first two
advertisements of the fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Franks campaign has assembled a script of one of the
commercials and is appalled: It calls Corzine ''the one (candidate)
who supports putting Social Security in a 'lock box,''' even though
Franks voted for such an idea.
</P>
<P>
   Franks flips the channels on the van's television, searching for
a news program that might carry the ads.
</P>
<P>
   The search is fruitless. But the unflappable candidate feigns
delight at finding a tuxedoed Jerry Lewis leading his annual
Muscular Dystrophy Association telethon.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here it is! Jerry!'' Franks exclaims. ''We can watch this for
hours!''
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bosnia War Crimes Suspects Arrested  </HEADLINE>
By EUGENE BRCIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) -- Police have arrested two Croat men
suspected of belonging to a group that waged a 1993 killing spree
in a Bosnian Muslim village during Bosnia's war, an interior
ministry official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ante Sliskovic, 50, and Tomo Vlajic, 35, were found hiding in
the central Adriatic city of Zadar and arrested earlier this week,
police spokesman Emil Bilic said.
</P>
<P>
   Bilic said police were looking for two other men, Vlado Cosic
and Pasko Ljubicic, who also are suspected of participating in the
killing of more than 100 Muslims, including women and children, in
the village of Ahmici in central Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The four are not sought by the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The
Hague, Netherlands, so they likely will be prosecuted in Croatia.
If there is a trial, it would be the first time Croatia tries it
citizens for war crimes committed against Muslims in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ivica Racan said the arrest ''proves that
criminals will no longer be able to live freely and peacefully
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Racan's government has cooperated with The Hague tribunal since
taking power eight months ago. It acknowledged in May that the
four, all members of the Bosnian Croat wartime militia, were given
Croatian citizenship and fake identities during the authoritarian
rule of late President Franjo Tudjman.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest of the two men may help vindicate a Bosnian Croat
army general who was convicted by the international war crimes
tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, earlier this year for taking
part in the killings in Ahmici.
</P>
<P>
   It is widely believed that Gen. Tihomir Blaskic, who was
sentenced to 45 years in prison for ordering the ethnic purges that
left hundreds of Muslim civilians dead, was framed by top Croat
political officials.
</P>
<P>
   One-time allies against Bosnian Serbs, Bosnia's Croats and
Muslims turned against each other in 1993 and fought a yearlong war
for territory.
</P>
<P>
   Many political analysts believe the conflict was ignited by
secret plans by Tudjman and his nationalist party, then in power,
to carve out territory for Bosnian Croats and join it with Croatia
proper.
</P>
<P>
   Croatian media have speculated that Tudjman's government tried
to use Blaskic as a scapegoat to cover up a separate chain of
command that existed between certain soldiers or units and often
functioned above the heads of military leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Police had been searching for the three suspects since March,
when Croatia's new reformist government discovered documents in
Tudjman's archives that indicated a conspiracy between Tudjman's
government and the group to disguise events related to the Ahmici
slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   The documents are said to link the group, which was given secret
identities by the state intelligence bureau, directly to war
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Blaskic's defense attorney, Ante Nobilo, said Wednesday the
arrests could mean a breakthrough in his upcoming appeal before the
tribunal in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
   ''The arrests can lead to Blaskic's vindication if the true
background and true order-issuing authorities are established,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Lost dog journeys by train  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FAIRFIELD, Conn. (AP) - The disappearance of Alex the Scottish
terrier set off a search by his owner, neighbors and even police.
</P>
<P>
   Little did they know Alex took the 9:14 p.m. train to New Haven.
</P>
<P>
   His owner, June Linsley, said she discovered the 1-year-old dog
missing from her fenced-in yard about 8:30 p.m. Monday. She alerted
neighbors and called Fairfield police.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Tim Stalling, who patrols Linsley's Southport
neighborhood, helped her search for the dog for about 45 minutes.
Neighbors also helped look, but no one could find Alex.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was heartbroken. It was a puppy I had for a month, and I
adored him,'' Linsley said.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 minutes later, Stalling rang her doorbell.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said, 'I think you better sit down. Your dog is in New
Haven,''' Linsley said.
</P>
<P>
   A Metro-North Railroad employee had discovered the dog and,
after reading the tags, called Fairfield police.
</P>
<P>
   The Southport railroad station is close to Linsley's house. Alex
had burrowed through a hole in the fence around Linsley's yard to
get out then apparently caught the next train out of town.
</P>
<P>
   What happened to Alex on the train ride and who, if anyone,
minded him while he traveled for 40 minutes remains a mystery,
Linsley said.
</P>
<P>
   A Metro-North police officer drove Alex back home from New
Haven.
</P>
<P>
   ''The dog was pooped,'' said Linsley. ''It had been very
busy.''

<HEADLINE> Daryl Hannah To Make Stage Debut  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Daryl Hannah has been in more than 30 movies. But
a bad case of stage fright has kept her from doing theater.
</P>
<P>
   That will change next month, when she makes her professional
stage debut in ''The Seven Year Itch.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I have this big thing with stage fright, and it's always been
an issue,'' Hannah, 39, said Wednesday. ''So I figure it's now or
never.''
</P>
<P>
   Hannah is cast in the revival of George Axelrod's play as The
Girl -- the role played by Marilyn Monroe in the 1955 film.
</P>
<P>
   The play opens Oct. 9 at London's Queen's Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Hannah, whose films have included ''Splash'' and ''Roxanne,''
she wasn't interested in doing a ''shabby impersonation'' of
Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   Far more pressing, she said, is overcoming her nerves.
</P>
<P>
   ''Either I'll survive it, or I won't,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Aims Anti-Drug Ads At Indians  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration unveiled a $2
million advertising campaign Wednesday aimed at fighting drug abuse
among American Indians, who have the highest rates of drug use in
the country, and the crime and other social problems that go with
them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm dismayed at how poorly we've responded to this problem,''
Clinton drug control adviser Barry McCaffrey said. He spoke at a
conference of tribal leaders and substance abuse experts organized
by the White House and other government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   A federal study released last week found that 19.6 percent of
teen-age American Indians used illicit drugs, the highest rate of
any group in the nation. The national average for those between 12
and 17 years old was 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And although a lower percentage of Indians drink alcohol than
the general population, alcohol-related deaths among Indians of
ages 15-24 are 17 times higher than the national average, McCaffrey
said.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey showed off anti-drug print and radio ads his office is
backing that will run in 79 tribal newspapers, eight national
newspapers or magazines and scores of radio stations. The print ads
include images of Indian fathers and sons, telling readers to
''pass down the traditions and communicate to our youth that drugs
are not part of our Native cultures.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Doing drugs is not the Indian way,'' the young announcer in
one of the radio ads says.
</P>
<P>
   Some tribal officials at the conference said the federal
government is not doing enough to fight addictions among Indians,
particularly alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
   ''What are we doing with the people that are making the
Budweisers, the Coors, that are killing us?'' asked Lloyd
Tortalita, governor of New Mexico's Acoma Pueblo. ''The people that
we elect to Congress are taking money from the alcohol makers. We
will always have this problem with alcohol as long as that
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said he agreed that alcohol abuse is America's top
drug problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''The alcohol industry has some political clout,'' McCaffrey
said. ''But I don't think the solution to alcohol abuse lies in
Congress. I think it lies in the community.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said his office has given 14 grants to alcohol and
drug treatment or prevention programs for American Indians, and
plans to give another 10 next week. Those grants are all for
$100,000 or less and last up to three years.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's so hard to get grants when we have 500 other tribes to
fight with,'' Tortalita said. ''When you do get a good program
going, the grant is only one to three years. We need more
funding.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey agreed and said some of the grants may need to be
extended to continue worthy programs.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Jazz is more than a sophisticated form of music,
says documentary filmmaker Ken Burns. It's a vehicle for studying
history.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jazz is a precise prism through which so much of American
history can be seen -- race, two world wars, a great depression,

''Jazz'' for PBS.

<P>
   The documentary, to be aired in January, contains more than 75
interviews and 498 pieces of music. Burns was at the Birdland jazz
club Wednesday promoting the series.
</P>
<P>
   ''The simplest, most crowd-pleasing aspects of today's popular
music has fast-food aspects,'' he said. ''To sit down and nourish
ourselves in the best way at a meal, you can't help but find
jazz.''

<HEADLINE> Taliban Says It Captured Key City  </HEADLINE>
By MOHAMMED GULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) -- The ruling Taliban army captured a key
northern city in Afghanistan on Wednesday after heavy fighting,
seizing 80 prisoners and cutting off a supply line to opposition
forces holed up in a mountain valley.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Taloqan, 160 miles north of the capital of Kabul,
was among the last important cities held by an alliance led by the
ousted president, Burhanuddin Rabbani, and former Defense Minister
Ahmed Shah Massood.
</P>
<P>
   Taliban fighters seized large numbers of weapons, including
tanks, and will soon launch an assault on the neighboring areas of
Farkhar and Badakshan, spokesman Sohail Shaheen said at the Taliban
embassy in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our soldiers are disarming the civilian population and
strengthening their positions in the city,'' Shaheen said. They
have started rebuilding a bridge between Taloqan and Farkhar that
was blown up by opposition forces to slow the Taliban advance, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Afghan opposition, Mohammed Abil, said
Taliban soldiers entered Taloqan after two hours of fighting during
the night.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our fighters suffered several casualties during the fighting
but none when we were pulling out,'' he said by telephone, without
elaborating on the casualties. ''We pulled out of the city to avoid
civilian casualties.''
</P>
<P>
   Abil said opposition soldiers are now positioned near Hazarbagh,
about three miles east of Taloqan. Taliban planes bombed opposition
forces in Hazarbagh several times, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a lot of confusion among our ranks right now,'' Abil
said. ''Our soldiers are tired and upset, but they are determined
to win back Taloqan.''
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban, who are Sunni Muslims and mostly Pashtun,
Afghanistan's ethnic majority, rule more than 90 percent of the
country under a strict version of Islamic law. The opposition is
made up of ethnic and religious minorities, including Shiite
Muslims, Hazaras, Tajiks and Uzbeks.
</P>
<P>
   With the loss of Taloqan, the opposition now controls only the
neighboring province of Badakshan and small pockets in a few other
northern provinces. Close to the border with the Central Asian
state of Tajikistan, Taloqan served as the main supply route to
opposition forces in Panjshir valley, 70 miles northeast of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
   Taloqan had been under siege for several weeks after a string of
battles in which Taliban soldiers captured several important
northern towns. Neither the opposition nor the Taliban has released
casualty figures.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Taliban issued a statement saying the United
Nations should not have included Rabbani among world leaders
invited to its Millennium Summit. The statement from Foreign
Minister Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil said Rabbani has ''little
following'' in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   ''The U.N. should take into account the reality and recognize
our government,'' he said. ''Rabbani is not in a position to
implement any of the U.N. resolutions that would be passed in the
summit.''

<HEADLINE> BC-NY--Toxic Falls, Bjt,0398  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ITHACA, N.Y. (AP) - The federal government is poised to carry
out an emergency cleanup of a recreational gorge contaminated with
high concentrations of lead left behind by a century-old gun
factory.
</P>
<P>
   State environmental authorities documented hazardous levels of
lead at Fall Creek gorge in 1995, but their findings only came to
light after Cornell University sold the city a 10-acre plot next to
the abandoned Ithaca Gun factory for $1 last winter.
</P>
<P>
   With its creek and 150-foot waterfall, the already highly
popular hangout for hikers, swimmers and fishing enthusiasts was to
be turned into a city park.
</P>
<P>
   ''You probably can't find a kid in Ithaca that hasn't swum in
this waterway,'' Walter Hang, an environmental activist who maps
toxic sites around New York state, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ithaca Gun, which closed down in the 1980s, was situated on an
upper edge of the gorge and ''literally dumped the lead on the
ground adjacent to the factory on land that happens to be owned by
Cornell,'' Hang said.
</P>
<P>
   In its most recent testing in 1998, the state Department of
Environmental Conservation found lead levels as high as 215,000
parts per million - more than 500 times above acceptable state
levels. Lead, a highly toxic element, can cause damage to the brain
and nervous system if its dust is ingested or inhaled.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency took
soil samples last month and revealed this week that the site
qualifies for emergency cleanup of hazardous waste. The agency
plans to carry out tests in late September to determine the extent
of contamination in the gorge, which runs into Cayuga Lake.
</P>
<P>
   When those results are compiled, possibly by mid-October, the
agency will decide how much money is needed to remove the
contaminated soil and whether to place the site on the federal
Superfund program's national priority list.
</P>
<P>
   Getting placed on that list ''would in effect make it one of the
worst toxic dumps in the country,'' said Hang, who runs a business
called Toxics Targeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very rare that they add sites this late in the game,'' he
said. ''The program began in 1980, so in theory the worst dumps
have all been identified and are moving ahead toward cleanup. But
when it comes to lead, there has been an exemption for hazardous
waste management requirements when bullets are involved.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Rejects China Proposal  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States will not accept a Chinese
proposal to label Taiwan a ''customs territory of China'' for its
entry into the World Trade Organization, President Clinton said in
a letter made public Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,
meanwhile, urged his colleagues to ''stand up for Taiwan'' in the
debate over China trade.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sen. John Kyl of Arizona blasted a Beijing proposal
that the document setting out terms for membership in the WTO make
it clear that Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau all are part of China, in
effect using the WTO to assert its disputed claim to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should hold out the prospect of legislative action,'' said
Kyl. He did not specify what that legislation would do.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement signed in 1992, once China joins the WTO,
Taiwan would immediately follow. Hong Kong is already a member as
it is treated as a separate customs territory.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in an Aug. 31 letter to Kyl, said his administration
has rejected China's proposal to call Taiwan ''a separate customs
territory of China.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We have advised the Chinese that such language is
inappropriate ... and that we will not accept it,'' Clinton's
letter said.
</P>
<P>
   As the bill to normalize trade with China went into its second
day of debate in the full Senate, Helms' committee held a separate
hearing on issues related to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a just world,'' said Helms, Taiwan would long ago have been
admitted to the 137-member trade organization because it is more
advanced economically than China and has for years met the
requirements for membership.
</P>
<P>
   Helms and Kyl called for some kind of pressure to prevent China
from blocking Taiwan's WTO membership.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think ... Congress ought to go ahead and do something,''
said Helms.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we ought to stand up for Taiwan now.''
</P>
<P>
   Fellow Republican Sen. Craig Thomas of Wyoming argued against an
amendment to the China trade bill, saying it would delay passage.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we need to find a way to get that message'' to China
without holding up permanent normal trade status, said Craig.
</P>
<P>
   China trade was the first order of business Tuesday as the
Senate returned from its summer recess with leaders of both parties
determined to approve the permanent normal trade relations (PNTR)
before lawmakers close shop to campaign before the November
elections.
</P>
<P>
   While supporters believe they have a solid majority in the
Senate, they face two main problems -- time limitations as Congress
rushes to finish its work for the year and the determination of
some senators to link normalized trade to China's weapons
proliferation and human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved the China trade bill last May on a 237-197
vote, and the concern is that any Senate amendments to that bill
would effectively kill it for the year because there wouldn't be
time for the two chambers to work out differences between the
measures.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate debate Wednesday, Democratic Sen. Max Baucus of
Montana urged support of the bill, saying rejection of PNTR will
likely lead to an indefinite delay in Taiwan's entry into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 4444.

<HEADLINE> Assemblyman, state agency spar over timing of Con Ed refunds  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A state assemblyman is again at odds with a
Pataki administration agency, this time over the timing of refunds
the state has ordered for Consolidated Edison Co. ratepayers.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Richard Brodsky, a Democrat from Westchester County,
accused the state Consumer Protection Board Wednesday of taking the
''unprecedented'' action of siding with Con Ed in the refund case
and not with consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Consumer Protection Board exists to protect the consumers
of this state, not the corporations who have acted negligently,''
Brodsky complained.
</P>
<P>
   He filed a comment with the state Public Service Commission
asking that the utility-regulating agency ignore a Consumer
Protection Board request to delay by a month the distribution of
refunds by Consolidated Edison.
</P>
<P>
   Under a state law approved by the Legislature and Gov. George
Pataki earlier this year, about 3 million Con Ed customers are
supposed to get $162 million in refunds beginning Monday.
</P>
<P>
   For residential ratepayers, the refunds would amount to about
$14 in New York City and $21 in Westchester County, Con Ed's
service territory.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, a federal judge in Albany has
scheduled oral arguments for Sept. 19 to hear Con Ed's challenge to
the law ordering it to refund the money. He has also set this
Friday as a deadline for the filing of papers into a preliminary
injunction requested by the utility asking that the refunds be
delayed until its claim against the state is decided.
</P>
<P>
   The utility will argue that the refund statute violates the U.S.
Constitution under a number of provisions, including equal
protection and due process clauses.
</P>
<P>
   Con Ed is contending that to give back the money and then to be
allowed to collect it again will cause ''confusion and resistance''
among its customers.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, the Consumer Protection Board agreed with the utility.
While saying it believes the constitutionality of the law will be
upheld, the Consumer board said it will do no harm to delay the
refund until on or about Oct. 10. By that time, the board is
arguing before the PSC, it'll be known if a federal judge will
issue a temporary injunction against enforcement of the refund law
- a crucial indicator of whether the statute will eventually be
struck down or upheld.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the Consumer Protection Board is asking that
interest be accumulated on the refunds held by Con Ed during
September, with that extra money added to the checks if and when
they are sent to ratepayers.
</P>
<P>
   ''If anything, we'll be avoiding confusion and the consumers
will be held harmless by waiting to see what the court says about
this with the interest accruing at our request,'' said Consumer
Protection Board spokesman Jon Sorensen. ''There will be no
financial loss. The only thing that be lost will be confusion on
the part of Con Ed customers.''
</P>
<P>
   He called Brodsky's criticism ''another example of where the
assemblyman is grasping for the headline first.''
</P>
<P>
   Brodsky and the Republican Pataki administration have clashed
repeatedly, especially over Pataki's environmental policies.
Brodsky chairs the Assembly's environmental conservation committee.

<HEADLINE> Debate Dispute Reaches Congress  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The debate over debates spread from the
presidential campaigns to Congress Wednesday, with Democrats saying
Republicans were ducking a chance to discuss the issues.
</P>
<P>
   House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt, in a letter to House
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said he was ''disappointed'' that
Hastert had declined an invitation from PBS's ''The NewsHour with
Jim Lehrer'' for a debate among congressional leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt, from Missouri, and Senate Democratic leader Tom
Daschle of South Dakota agreed to the proposed Oct. 15 debate, but
Hastert and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., declined,
said Rob Flynn, director of communications for The NewsHour.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush and Gore campaigns are at odds over the format for
presidential debates. Vice President Al Gore has agreed to a
proposal by the Commission on Presidential Debates for three
90-minute debates aired by all the major networks. Texas Gov.
George W. Bush says he will participate in only one, plus
appearances on CNN and NBC talk shows that will be broadcast only
by their parent networks.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt said that given Bush's rejection of the three debates
sponsored by the commission, ''your refusal raises questions about
whether the leaders of the Republican party really want any honest
discussion of the issues this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert spokesman John Feehery said the proposed debate, coming
right at the end of the legislative session and the beginning of
the election campaign, didn't fit in the speaker's schedule.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the ''Democratic leadership was looking at the
electoral map and, seeing they are not going to take back the
majority, looking for a Hail Mary play.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 ''The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer'' hosted a debate in
Williamsburg, Va., among Gephardt, Daschle, Lott and then Speaker
Newt Gingrich, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn said The NewsHour hoped to stage the debate with other
Republican congressional leaders. Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., the
fourth-ranked Republican in the House, said he'd be willing to
appear with Daschle and Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we've got a good story to tell,'' Watts said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BERNE, N.Y. (AP) - The school nurse called during Kyle Carroll's
first week of second grade last September. Wasn't Kyle going to be
taking his Ritalin?
</P>
<P>
   No, Jill Carroll said, he made it through the summer without the
drug and did just fine. She and her husband Michael were holding
out, hoping the Ritalin days were over.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 15, the Carrolls say they got another call. Kyle was in
the office and the district was threatening to expel him unless the
medicating resumed. Superintendent Steven Schrade, who wasn't with
the approximately 1,200-student school district when all this
happened, denies the threat and now says the whole situation with
Kyle ''was from well-intentioned people and just snowballed.''
</P>
<P>
   Confidentiality reasons, Schrade said, prevented him from being
able to discuss the case or the battle of wills the Carrolls say
took place between Kyle and his teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there are a number of other factors that we can't talk
about,'' he said. ''Believe me, Ritalin wasn't the only reason that
the family ended up in Family Court.''
</P>
<P>
   Meetings would follow, with the Carrolls on one side of the
table and a team including guidance counselors and special
education specialists on the other.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just started throwing things at them, why Kyle shouldn't be
on Ritalin,'' Michael Carroll said. ''They just kept throwing
things back at me, why he had to be. They didn't let me finish a
sentence. They were comparing Ritalin to insulin. It has nothing to
do with that. (Without insulin) the child dies. Without Ritalin
you've just got to give a lot more time.''
</P>
<P>
   The law requires that school employees report instances of
neglect to child protective agencies. In Kyle's case, someone at
the school equated the failure to medicate Kyle with the
unexplained bruises or signs of malnutrition that prompt other
calls. The Family Court case, and court order mandating the
Carrolls continue giving Kyle medications prescribed by a
physician, followed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The case as I see it is educational neglect,'' said Pamela J.
Joern, the law guardian appointed to the case. ''Your child has a
diagnosis, it interferes with his education, a recommendation is
made. It is not followed by the parents. It continues to interfere
with his education. The parents take no steps to address the
problem. It's not a pro-Ritalin decision; it's not an anti-Ritalin
decision. A parent failed to ensure their child was able to receive
an education.''
</P>
<P>
   Psychiatrist Susan Abbott of Port Jefferson, Long Island,
defends this, saying Kyle probably was better able to learn when
medicated.
</P>
<P>
   ''If unmedicated, you certainly won't learn as much as well, you
won't achieve the same grades, you may not be able to follow your
aspirations, attend your college of choice,'' she said. ''When the
kids in the neighborhood don't play with you and you fall farther
and farther behind...that's sad.''
</P>
<P>
   On Ritalin, the Carrolls say, Kyle is a zombie. He barely eats
or sleeps; Michael says he senses him laying awake in his bedroom
long into the night. When the parents came to school to view the
children's pipe-cleaner bug projects, all the other children ran
around excitedly. Kyle sat at his desk, staring off into space.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'd rather have him hyperactive than 'duh...,''' Jill said.
</P>
<P>
   Side effects like Kyle's are often attributed to Ritalin; the
drug has also been associated with stunted growth and irregular
heart beat, and is named in at least one death.
</P>
<P>
   The Carrolls feel the school would rather drug Kyle than take
time with him.
</P>
<P>
   Said Abbott, ''I think in a world where each child can have
their own teacher that would work. But in a class where teachers
spend 33 percent of the time on one child with ADHD... you kind of
have to think of the real world here.''

<HEADLINE> Override of Clinton Veto Unlikely  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republican leaders, virtually conceding
they lack the votes to override President Clinton's veto of the
estate tax repeal bill, will push ahead Thursday with a vote they
believe will put many Democrats on the spot and demonstrate the
GOP's commitment to tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any Democrat that flip-flops on this issue to keep the death
tax alive will surely face the voters' wrath on election day,''
said Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, the fourth-ranking House GOP
leader. ''We're hopeful we can get very close.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 279-136 vote in June, 65 Democrats and one independent
joined all 213 Republicans voting as the House agreed to phase out
inheritance taxes at a cost of $105 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   While the margin was just over the two-thirds margin needed to
override a veto, Democratic leaders say 11 of their members who
missed the vote support Clinton's action and that at least 10 more
would be persuaded to switch sides.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we'll sustain the veto,'' Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers told reporters Wednesday, adding that the Clinton
administration was working with House Democrats to shore up
support.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the House did vote to override the veto, a two-thirds
Senate margin is also required -- and the 59-39 Senate vote to pass
the bill in July was eight short of that threshold.
</P>
<P>
   Although the first $675,000 of an estate is exempt from tax and
only about 2 percent of estates are affected each year, repealing
the tax has grown in popularity on Capitol Hill. One reason is a
forceful lobbying campaign led by the National Association of
Manufacturers, American Farm Bureau Federation and National
Federation of Independent Business. The groups contends the tax is
inherently unfair.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Danner, a senior vice president at the small business group,
said its 600,000 members ''will keep a particularly close eye ...
on those who desert their earlier support of death tax relief.''
</P>
<P>
   The planned action Thursday would be the first of two
high-profile override votes Republicans are staging this month on
Clinton tax bill vetoes. Next week, the House will decide whether
to sustain the president's veto of the 10-year, $292 billion
marriage penalty tax cut, for which 53 House Democrats voted.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said he would sign less costly versions of both
bills as long as the tax relief is directed more toward
middle-income people. There is some sentiment in GOP ranks to
demonstrate an election-year willingness to compromise, but other
Republicans prefer a clear dividing line on tax issues for voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've made the point. We've made the effort,'' said Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. ''Unfortunately, President
Clinton continues to talk one way and do something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Summers said the administration maintains that the GOP approach
of passing individual tax cuts that rely on projected budget
surpluses makes it impossible to determine the cuts' overall impact
on the economy and on priorities such as education, Social
Security, Medicare and paying down the federal debt.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to have a much clearer idea about where we're going
before we're able to make judgments on individual tax pieces,''
Summers said.
</P>
<P>
   There have been nine attempts by Congress to override a Clinton
veto since Republicans took power in 1995. Four have won House
approval and only two -- on budget line-item vetoes and securities
litigation reform -- were overridden by the House and Senate as
required.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> UConn, ANC join forces to catalog apartheid's paper trail  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM J. KOLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   STORRS, Conn. (AP) - They are the ghosts of South Africa's
bloody struggle against apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   More than 5,000 boxes of documents and diaries, including some
of Nelson Mandela's anguished personal letters, will be catalogued
at the University of Connecticut under a partnership with the
African National Congress launched Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   South African officials said the archive will ensure the world
never forgets how their country's decades of white rule and brutal
policy of racial separation were overcome - or underestimate the
chances that it could happen again somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a disease which, if we are not able to cure it, will
repeat itself in the 21st century,'' warned Frene Ginwala, the
speaker of South Africa's parliament and a prominent ANC leader.
</P>
<P>
   The effort is being paid for with $1.1 million in grants from
the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the United Negro College Fund and
the U.S. Agency for International Development. It will focus on
documents that for years were kept secret by ordinary South
Africans as well as ANC leaders in exile around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The records range from schoolchildren's drawings to the
correspondence of leaders such as Mandela, South Africa's former
president; Chris Hani, the late leader of the ANC's military wing;
and longtime ANC leader Walter Sisulu.
</P>
<P>
   Amii Omara-Otunnu, a UConn history professor leading the archive
effort, said much of the ANC's history still hasn't been told. The
movement was forced underground for decades by South Africa's
repressive government.
</P>
<P>
   The project, he said, will prevent invaluable historical
documents from ending up as ''dead things rusting and collecting
dust.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the archive will take several years to set up, scholars
worldwide are expected to examine the records, making UConn's Dodd
Research Center one of North America's leading centers devoted to
the history of the 50-year struggle. Apartheid ended in 1994 when
South Africa held its first all-race elections.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to examining and cataloguing documents, experts will
train South African researchers who will fan out and record oral
histories from the tens of thousands of people ''whose survival at
times depended on not putting things in writing,'' said UConn
President Phillip E. Austin.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., a member of the House
Committee on International Relations, said the project would help
guard against future revisionists who might deny that apartheid
ever existed, much as some today question the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't take long for a new generation to come around and
find it almost unbelievable,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Ends Down 118; Dow Gains 50  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Tech stocks fell for a second straight session
today as analysts cut their ratings on several high-profile
companies, while Blue chips moved higher on news of a major deal in
the financial services industry.
</P>
<P>
   The high-tech driven Nasdaq composite index was off 117.80 at
4,025.38, according to preliminary calculations.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 50.03 at 11,310.64,
and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 13.40 at 1,493.68.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup, the nation's biggest financial services company, said
it will buy lender Associates First Capital for about $31.1 billion
in stock. The deal should speed Citigroup's global expansion in
lending to consumers, giving it control of the U.S.'s largest
publicly traded finance company and Japan's fifth largest consumer
finance company.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup, a Dow component, fell $2.13 to $55.81, but shares of
Associates First Capital jumped $10.63, nearly 38 percent, to
$38.63.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said a government report showing higher U.S.
productivity also bolstered investors' belief that interest rates
will remain stable for the near future.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department said Americans' productivity, a key measure
of rising living standards, surged at a 5.7 percent annual rate in
the second quarter. The strong gain pushed unit labor costs, a key
gauge of inflation pressures, down by a rate of 0.4 percent, the
lowest since the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Tech stocks, however, remained depressed for a second day,
primarily because of more analyst downgrades of prominent
companies. On Tuesday, high-tech stocks declined after a prominent
analyst lowered his rating on Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Micron Technology fell $9.50 to $68.75 on Wednesday
after Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette lowered its rating on the memory
chipmaker from ''buy'' to ''underperform.'' Shares of
telecommunications chipmaker Applied Microcircuits were down $10.77
at $179.05.
</P>
<P>
   And telecom provider WorldCom fell $2.25 to $31.50 after
analysts from Lehman Brothers and Wachovia Securities downgraded
the stock.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think those downgrades are concerning people about
third-quarter earnings, so you're seeing weakness in those
stocks,'' said Barry Berman, managing director of equity trading
for Robert W. Baird &AMP; Co. in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of MP3.com fell 69 cents -- more than 8 percent -- to $7.88
after a federal judge ruled Wednesday that the company had
willfully violated copyrights of music companies and awarded
Universal Music Group $25,000 per CD, a penalty that could reach as
much as $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, crude for delivery in October surpassed the
previous 10-year high of $34.37 on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, reaching $34.45 before declining somewhat to $34.35.
</P>
<P>
   Higher oil prices are considered by some to be a potential
inflationary pressure, but at least one analyst wasn't worried.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this truly was a long-term inflationary threat, that would
be showing up at the bond market in the form of higher interest
rates and we don't see that happening,'' said Alan Skrainka, chief
market strategist at Edward Jones of St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, the euro fell to near 87 cents, smashing through last
Thursday's previous low of 88.37 cents. The currency also fell to a
new low against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   While the downturn could hurt U.S. companies with European
investments, it also might translate into a boost for U.S.
financial markets as investors who previously put their money into
European exchanges look for other places to invest.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange. Volume came to 992.30 million shares,
compared to 836.45 million the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 2.91 at 536.11.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.32 percent.
Germany's DAX index was down 0.84 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was
down 0.86 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 0.87 percent.

   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The state's procurement laws have been
expanded to include foreign countries, preventing businesses in
nations that discriminate against New York firms from being awarded
state contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki said the measure will close a loophole in
current procurement laws, which target only other states considered
unfair by New York.
</P>
<P>
   The new law expanded the definition of ''discriminatory
jurisdictions'' to include countries, nations or provinces that
show preferences for their own businesses or prevent New York
companies from competing fairly in their government contracts.
</P>
<P>
   A state agency could waive the restriction against companies in
discriminatory jurisdictions in writing if it was determined that
such a move would be in the best interest of New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   The measure gained momentum in the state Legislature in the last
year, when the state awarded the contract for printing its ''I Love
New York'' brochures to an Ontario firm that happened to be the
lowest bidder. But lawmakers later found out that the Canadian
province's procurement policies gave a 10 percent preference to
local businesses when it came to awarding government contracts
there.
</P>
<P>
   Under Ontario's policy, New York-based companies could in theory
compete for contracts, as long as anything that goes into
production, including manpower, is Canadian, Pataki spokesman
Michael McKeon said.
</P>
<P>
   ''An Albany company is not going to have Canadian citizens
working for it,'' McKeon said. ''So while they're saying it's open,
the fact is it's not.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're basically reciprocating,'' added Art Levy, spokesman for
state Sen. John DeFrancisco, a Syracuse Republican and sponsor of
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Advances in technology and transportation systems have made it
increasingly easy for foreign firms to bid on New York state
contracts, and Pataki said it's only fair that New York businesses
could expect equal treatment when they solicit government contracts
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ''This bill will provide for an incentive for federal and
regional governments of those nations to reform their procurement
laws so that New York firms will be able to compete on a level
playing field,'' Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Economic Development, which maintains a
list of discriminatory jurisdictions, would oversee adding foreign
countries to the list. States that are currently classified as
discriminatory jurisdictions are: Alaska, Hawaii, Louisiana,
Montana, South Carolina, West Virginia and Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   It is estimated that the state government spends more than $8.5
billion each year to purchase goods and services.

<HEADLINE> Leader: Milosevic Won't Accept Loss  </HEADLINE>
By ALEN MLATISUMA
<TEXT>
<P>
   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The prime minister of Montenegro,
Yugoslavia's smaller republic, said Wednesday that President
Slobodan Milosevic would never concede defeat in elections even if
the ballot count goes against him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe Mr. Milosevic would never acknowledge a defeat in
the elections and would do everything to stay in power,'' Prime
Minister Filip Vujanovic said.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's behavior has always been ''undemocratic,'' Vujanovic
said, adding he saw no reason for the autocratic ruler to change
should he lose the Sept. 24 Yugoslav presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   The elections will be decided in Serbia, the much larger
Yugoslav republic and Milosevic's power base, and Vujanovic said
that it would be ''up to the Serbian people and progressive forces
within Serbia to struggle and achieve democracy -- something I am
convinced is entirely possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Tensions have been growing in Montenegro in recent weeks ahead
of the Yugoslav presidential and parliamentary elections.
Vujanovic's pro-Western government has called on Montenegrins to
boycott the vote, citing constitutional changes imposed by
Milosevic that weaken the republic's clout in the two-state
federation.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegrin President Milo Djukanovic, considered a chief
Milosevic foe, has claimed that if his tiny republic of 600,000
participated in the vote, it would give legitimacy to the Belgrade
regime and prolong its survival.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro is also hesitant to proclaim outright independence,
fearing clashes within the republic, also bitterly split between
those who back the reformist leadership and those loyal to
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's regime has attacked Vujanovic's government for its
ties to the West, describing it as a traitor set on destroying
Yugoslavia. Anti-Western sentiments in Yugoslavia remain strong
following the NATO bombing campaign last year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the boycott, Montenegro has said it would not prevent
those loyal to Milosevic from voting on Montenegrin territory.
</P>
<P>
   Vujanovic also said Montenegrin officials and Milosevic's
supporters are involved in discussions on how to organize the
balloting in Montenegro in order to avoid further rise of tensions.
</P>
<P>
   Should Montenegrin officials be denied the opportunity to
observe the balloting, Vujanovic said they would be convinced of a
carefully planned and premeditated election fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Vujanovic also rejected recent claims by Milosevic's chief
Montenegrin associate, Yugoslav Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic,
that 180,000 Montenegrins signed a petition supporting Milosevic's
presidential candidacy. The claim is ''just a simple marketing
move'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, NATO peacekeepers stopped a high-ranking Serbian
official and presidential candidate for about one hour in Kosovo
before allowing him to leave the province.
</P>
<P>
   Local villagers near Zvecan, in northern Kosovo, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said that Tomislav Nikolic and some 30
persons from his entourage were stopped after NATO troops
discovered arms in the convoy. Nikolic, an ultranationalist, is
running against Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Reports that the NATO peacekeepers confiscated arms belonging to
a Radical Party security guard traveling with Nikolic could not be
immediately confirmed.

<HEADLINE> Steroid Pills Said Better for Asthma  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Doctors treating children for severe asthma
attacks should stick with standard steroid pills and not switch to
inhaled steroids, a study found.
</P>
<P>
   Steroid pills, such as prednisone, are safe when given for short
doses. But some pediatricians have wondered whether inhaled
steroids, which are easier to use, might work as well and be safer
still.
</P>
<P>
   The new study, conducted at the Hospital for Sick Children in
Toronto, attempted to settle this issue. One hundred children with
severe asthma attacks were randomly given either the inhaled or the
pill form of steroids.
</P>
<P>
   The results were clear: Children given prednisone pills
recovered more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ''This shows you shouldn't food around. If you have somebody
with severe asthma, don't rely on inhaled corticosteroids,'' said
Dr. Joseph Reisman of the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, a
co-author of the study.
</P>
<P>
   The report, published in Thursday's issue of the New England
Journal of Medicine, found that children given prednisone were
almost three times as likely to have an excellent response to
treatment and were only one-third as likely to be hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   The study was partially financed by Glaxo Wellcome, which makes
Flonase, the inhaled steroid tested in the study.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeking Mideast Peace Talks  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- President Clinton labored Wednesday to impress
Israeli and Palestinian leaders with a sense of urgency as their
deadline for a settlement loomed over the horizon, only a week
away.
</P>
<P>
   Holding back-to-back meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, the president faced
long odds in trying to relaunch his flagging peace process and bid
for a peacemaker's place in history.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he forged ahead, meeting first with Barak at an East Side
hotel, which was surrounded by throngs of New York City police. The
streets were virtually impassable, with scores of police cars
providing a further shield.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, in a speech to the Millennium Summit, gave no quarter on
Jerusalem, saying, ''We have agreed to share the city, eliminate
barriers and borders therein, in contrast to attempts at
monopolizing it.''
</P>
<P>
   He called the city ''the cradle of Christ and the site of
Prophet Mohammed's ascension to heaven,'' making no mention of
Jews' attachment to the city for more than 2,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, in turn, asked Arafat to join him in making painful
concessions for peace. He said a historic opportunity must not be
missed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are at the Rubicon and no one of us can cross it alone,''
Barak said as Arafat listened impassively, his face grim.
</P>
<P>
   With the Israeli and Palestinian leaders far apart on the core
issues and exchanging acrimonious sallies, Clinton all but gave up
on achieving a settlement by Sept. 13, the deadline they set last
year with his blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we can work through that if there is a sense of
progress,'' Clinton said as he met with Russian President Vladimir
Putin on the fringes of a U.N. Millennium Summit that has brought
scores of government leaders here.
</P>
<P>
   ''The main thing they have to decide,'' he said of the Israeli
and Palestinian leaders, is that ''they are going to have an
agreement by what is the real calendar -- which is the clock that is
ticking in the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the tough core issues still eluding resolution are the
disposition of hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees and
the future of east Jerusalem, which Arafat demands be put under
Palestinian sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't expect an agreement over the city, unless the
Americans bring something new,'' said Palestinian negotiator Ahmed
Qureia.
</P>
<P>
   Pressing in on Clinton are a meeting Saturday of the Palestine
Liberation Organization's Central Council in Gaza City and a
session next month of the Israeli Knesset where critics of Barak
for his offers to Arafat of nearly all the occupied territory and
control over part of Jerusalem have stirred outrage.
</P>
<P>
   The top item at the Palestinian meeting is whether to declare
statehood on the West Bank land Israel has already turned over to
the Palestinians. Arafat plans to attend, which limits Clinton's
running room here.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton headed into back-to-back meetings with Barak and
Arafat, he cautioned that the opportunity for a peace agreement
''is fleeting and about to pass.''
</P>
<P>
   The president appealed to world leaders attending a unique
Millennium summit to support peace in the Middle East. He also set
up meetings with Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and King
Abdullah of Jordan to try to rally Arab support.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met in the meantime with
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa and Prince Saud, the Saudi
foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   She set up a meeting with Arafat before Clinton's, and talked
for 45 minutes with Barak on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''To those who have supported the right of Israel to live in
security and peace, to those who have championed the Palestinian
cause these many years, let me say to all of you: They need your
support now more than ever to take the hard risks for peace,''
Clinton said in a speech at the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have the chance to do it,'' he said, ''but like all
life's chances, it is fleeting and about to pass. There is not a
moment to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's appeal sought to mute the two sides' exchange of
accusations of inflexibility and backsliding. Those arguments
dimmed prospects that Clinton would succeed in the few days he will
be in New York with the two leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The president has virtually abandoned hopes for convening
another summit as he did at his Camp David mountain retreat in July
and he may not even attempt to bring the two leaders together in
light of their sharp differences.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat sought support from Canada, meanwhile, in a meeting with
Prime Minister Jean Chretien. Afterward, a Canadian official said
Arafat planned to meet with Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's office issued a tough statement Tuesday night saying a
breakthrough was not possible unless Arafat struck an ''open and
realistic'' stance.
</P>
<P>
   The statement, issued after he saw Albright, said ''they agreed
they still had not heard of a real change in Chairman Arafat's
position since Camp David.''
</P>
<P>
   While it was not a joint statement, a senior U.S. official said,
the administration was looking for both sides to take realistic
stands and make the necessary decisions for an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   On the Palestinian side, senior negotiator Saeb Erekat told
Americans for Peace Now, a dovish group, in Washington on Tuesday
that there had been ''major retrenchments'' in Israel's positions
since Clinton hosted the two leaders.

<HEADLINE> House Subpoenas SmithKline Papers  </HEADLINE>
By CLAUDE R. MARX
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House Commerce Committee, investigating
alleged Medicare overcharging by seven drug companies, on Wednesday
subpoenaed five documents describing SmithKline Beecham's pricing
procedures for its drug Kytril.
</P>
<P>
   SmithKline has until noon on Monday to turn over the documents.
If it fails to comply with the subpoena it could be subject to a
contempt charge that could result in a prison sentence of up to one
year and/or a $100,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   ''Discussions continued today and the committee has been very
accommodating. After continued discussions it became clear that the
company would force Chairman (Tom) Bliley to issue a subpoena,''
said committee spokesman Peter Sheffield. ''The committee feels
strongly that the five documents requested are imperative to the
completion of the investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   SmithKline spokesman Jeremy Hymsfeld said they had received the
subpoena and ''we intend to keep cooperating with the committee and
we hope to resolve to come to a satisfactory resolution of the
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation follows a Health and Human Services Department
report that the Health Care Financing Administration pays more for
22 drugs, including Kytril, because drug companies charge higher
prices to physicians being reimbursed by Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Kytril, an anti-nausea drug used mostly by chemotherapy
patients, is the only SmithKline product being investigated.
</P>
<P>
   SmithKline, whose American headquarters is in Philadelphia, had
previously turned over most of the documents that the committee
requested in May. But it held out on the five, maintaining they are
protected by attorney-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Bliley, R-Va., has frequently maintained that the privilege does
mot apply in this case.
</P>
<P>
   SmithKline announced last Thursday that it would sell Kytril to
Roche AG, of Switzerland, for $1.23 billion in cash. The
divestiture is part of SmithKline's effort to win regulatory
approval for its pending $75 billion merger with another British
drug maker, Glaxo Wellcome. The deal, which has been approved by
both companies' shareholders, is scheduled to close on Sept. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Glaxo Wellcome markets Zofran for chemotherapy.

<HEADLINE> RFK Jr. endorses Clinton; other environmentalists on fence  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an environmentalist whose
father faced carpetbagger accusations when he ran for Senate in New
York in 1964, gave Hillary Rodham Clinton his personal endorsement
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was here in 1964 campaigning across the state with my father
and I heard the same thing all across the state then - that he's a
carpetbagger and how could he be a good senator for New York
State,'' said Kennedy, who was 10 when his father, who was from
Massachusetts, campaigned for Senate in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is somebody who was not born in this state capable of coming
in and offering leadership? My answer to that is resoundingly,
yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, director of the Environmental Law Project at Pace
University and the Hudson Riverkeeper program, also gave Clinton
his blessing for her positions on environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Clinton won the endorsement of the Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   But two other important environmental groups, Friends of the
Earth and the New York League of Conservation Voters, remain
undecided between her and her Republican opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   ''We made it very clear to both of them that this is a tough
call,'' said NYLCV Chairman Paul Elston. He said the LCV invited
both candidates to debate environmental issues in the next month
but has not gotten commitments from either one.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have fought some real important battles side by side with
Rick Lazio in the past and found him to be committed to the
environment,'' said Mark Helm, spokesman for Friends of the Earth.
''The first lady has no track record to speak of in this area, and
it's important to have environmental champions on both sides of the
aisle. Therefore it would be real difficult to make a call at this
date.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy sits on NYLCV's board, as does Larry Rockefeller, an
environmental lawyer and a nephew of late governor Nelson
Rockefeller. Rockefeller, a Republican, often crosses party lines
to endorse Democrats, but said Wednesday that he was waiting until
the board meets closer to the election to make up his own mind on
the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said he had been tutoring Clinton on local environmental
issues and added that she had been ''supportive'' in getting help
from the White House on maintaining protections for New York City's
upstate watershed in conflict with two federal agencies, the Army
Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy acknowledged that he had also sought help from Lazio on
the watershed issue, and that Lazio ''wrote a very good letter'' to
the Army Corps of Engineers.
</P>
<P>
   But he criticized Lazio's overall environmental record, saying
he felt the congressman had not ''demonstrated environmental
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio spent the day fund-raising in Texas, Alabama and
Louisiana. An invitation letter to his Dallas fund-raiser was
signed by Charles Wyly, who, with his brother Sam, financed a
controversial ad about Sen. John McCain's environmental record. The
ads, which were criticized as being inaccurate, were paid for with
so-called ''soft money'' from an organization the Wyly brothers
formed called ''Republicans for Clean Air.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lazio campaign said Wyly was not attending the fund-raiser,
but merely signed the letter for it to help bring in guests.
</P>
<P>
   ''I find it interesting that Lazio's going to Texas to raise
money from Mr. Wyly, who ran such a really unfair ad against John
McCain using soft money in the Republican primary that totally
distorted Sen. McCain's record,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spokeswoman Karen Dunn called it ''hypocrisy'' for Lazio
to appear in ads with McCain to promote campaign finance reform
while allowing Wyly to help him raise money.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio campaign spokesman Dan McLagan returned the charge of
hypocrisy, saying: ''For her to make soft money an issue while
she's raising and spending millions and while Rick has yet to spend
a dime of it is beyond chutzpah.''

<HEADLINE> BC-NY--UN Summit-Protests, Bjt,590  </HEADLINE>
By LUKAS I. ALPERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP)- Honking horns mingled with voices of political
protest outside the walls of the United Nations on New York's
gridlocked streets Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   As the Millennium Summit began, demonstrators had their say on
everything from Middle East peace and slavery in Sudan to Cuban
leader Fidel Castro's presence and China's human rights policies.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, shopowners cooled their heels behind police barricades,
cut off from customers by tight security measures.
</P>
<P>
   ''You lose some business, but on the other hand you pick up with
the foreigners coming in to buy converters and adapters,'' said Bob
Kramer, co-owner of Kramer's Hardware, which was frequently blocked
by motorcades passing along Second Avenue and 49th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two protests were officially registered with police
Wednesday, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Falun Gong practitioners from around the world
gathered in the morning at a park opposite the Chinese Mission to
protest a crackdown on the movement's followers that began last
year in China.
</P>
<P>
   After sitting, stock still, in silent meditative protest, and
listening to statements read by practitioners who said they had
been detained and beaten in China for practicing Falun Gong, the
group rose in unison and marched in orderly rows the 12 blocks to
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong has attracted millions of followers with its
philosophy of exercise, meditation and beliefs drawn from Buddhism,
Taoism and the unorthodox ideas of its founder Li Hongzhi. While
followers say Falun Gong promotes health and morality, China's
government has banned it as a cult.
</P>
<P>
   ''We practice three principles - truth, compassion, and
forbearance,'' said Dong Li, a computer programmer from Mamaroneck,
who has practiced Falun Gong for a year. ''This apparently is not
concordant with Communist doctrine,''
</P>
<P>
   ''We really hope that (Chinese President) Jiang Zemin will stop
persecuting people who want to do this. We have no other intentions
than peaceful ones,'' Dong said.
</P>
<P>
   The march brought the Falun Gong protesters past the Sudanese
Mission on Third Avenue, where a group of 60 protesters demanded
the arrest of Sudanese President Hassan el-Bashir. Two of the
protesters, former slaves from Sudan and Mauritania, said the
United States is doing nothing to stop enslavement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why should the president of a slaving nation be allowed to
walk free on the streets of New York?'' asked Charles Jacobs,
president of the American Anti-Slavery Group, a Boston-based
organization that tries to raise awareness of forced labor around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Upon arriving at the United Nations, Falun Gong followers
silently hunkered down into the lotus position and began
meditating, while raucous neighbors nearby on Dag Hammerskjold
Plaza protested Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Later, they were all replaced by a new shift of demonstrators -
Iranians, sandwiched between Bangladeshis and anti-Castro Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is an insult to the free world that this man (Castro) is
here while the Dalai Lama was not allowed to attend,'' said Yvonne
Conde, a Cuban-American writer who lives in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Later, about a dozen sympathizers of the Iranian National
Council of Resistance, a Paris-based group that considers itself
Iran's government in exile, sat in the middle of First Avenue near
the U.N., screaming that Iranian President Mohammad Khatami is a
terrorist. Police arrived shortly and arrested them.

<HEADLINE> Five teens arrested for killing deliveryman  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Five hungry teen-agers apparently wanting some
Chinese food, but not wanting to pay for it, placed a $60 delivery
order to a vacant Queens house Friday night, and when the
deliveryman arrived, they allegedly beat him to death.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were just looking for a free meal,'' a law enforcement
source, speaking on condition of anonymity said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sheng Jin Liu, 44, arrived at the vacant house last Friday night
carrying two bags of food, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The four males and one female - ranging in age from 14 to 17 -
took only one bag of food, leaving the other behind to be nibbled
on by cats. They also left behind the several hundred dollars in
cash Liu was carrying, said Deputy Chief Patrick Timlin, commanding
officer of the Queens Detective Borough.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-agers, all friends from Queens, were identified as:
Robert Savage, 14; James Stone, 16; Stacy Royster, 17; Jamel
Murphy, 17; and Darryl Tyson, 17. All were charged with
second-degree murder; first-degree manslaughter, robbery and
criminal possession of a weapon offenses.
</P>
<P>
   According to a criminal complaint, the defendants admitted
''they were going to forcibly take the food from the victim,'' said
Detective Douglas Diesu of the 113th Detective Squad in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Royster called the Golden Wok restaurant in St. Albans, Queens,
Friday and placed several orders of food before 11:30 p.m., Timlin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Royster, who was to start at Queensborough Community College
Wednesday, met Liu as he drove up to the house. The four others
joined her, Timlin said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The four male defendants held the victim, put a sheet over his
head, beat him with their fists, and then defendant Savage struck
the victim in the head with a brick,'' Diesu said in the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   The teens admitted they took one bag, fled the scene, and ate
the food, Timlin said. They had ordered General Tso's chicken,
chicken and broccoli, shrimp lo mein and shrimp egg foo yung.
</P>
<P>
   Liu's wife called police when he did not return to the
restaurant within 15 minutes - Liu was killed about a mile from the
restaurant. A trace of the delivery order brought police to the
crime scene, where they found Liu dead. The medical examiner's
office said the cause of death was multiple blunt impact injuries
to the face, scalp and torso.
</P>
<P>
   Police were led to the teens by tracing the telephone call
Royster used to place the order to her cellular telephone, Timlin
said. All the teens, who have no prior criminal records, were
arrested at their homes Tuesday and brought to the 113th Precinct
for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Queens District Attorney Richard A. Brown said Liu's death was a
terrible, tragic case.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was killed without provocation and without reason,'' Brown
said. ''It was a shocking crime which leaves us all shaking our
heads as to why these kids would do what they are accused of
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   According to friends and neighbors, Liu came to the United
States about 10 years ago from Fuzhou, in southern-China. He worked
for several years at other restaurants before opening three Chinese
takeout restaurants of his own in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Liu's wife and two teen-age children came to New York two years
ago, and all work in the restaurants. Liu made the deliveries
himself, said Lin Yun, the manager of King's Wok, a few blocks from
the Golden Wok.
</P>
<P>
   One of Liu's regular customers said Liu had delivered her food a
few hours before he died.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a nice man, very hardworking,'' said Thelma Grandison.
''I don't know why they had to kill him.''

<HEADLINE> French Government Ends Trucker Talks  </HEADLINE>
By JOCELYN GECKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- French truckers stepped up a blockade of the
nation's fuel depots Wednesday as the government said it would make
no more concessions and demanded an end to protests that have
forced some gas stations to run dry.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Lionel Jospin took a tough line with the
truckers, saying their strike had ''inflicted a major handicap on
the French economy,'' and the government had reached its limit.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government will not go any farther. There will be no more
negotiations,'' Jospin told reporters after meeting with Transport
Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot, who spent the past two nights
negotiating with union leaders.
</P>
<P>
   French truckers have sealed off roads to nearly 100 of the
country's oil refineries and fuel depots since Sunday to protest
soaring fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   France has the second highest fuel prices in the European Union
after Britain. Unleaded gasoline costing $3.70 per gallon, of which
about 75 percent is tax. Diesel fuel in France costs $2.84 per
gallon, compared to a current average of $1.58 per gallon in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Since the blockade began Sunday, hundreds of gas stations have
run dry and local governments have begun rationing fuel as
motorists line up bumper-to-bumper at the pump.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in many regions have had to reserve gas for
emergency and police use. Some drivers crossed into neighboring
countries to fill their tanks.
</P>
<P>
   The dwindling fuel supply caused flights out of the Lyon airport
to be canceled or rerouted on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin's ultimatum to truckers came after his Green party allies
warned of a crisis within their coalition, saying his concessions
to truckers broke promises to promote environmental policies. The
Greens say France should favor rail traffic over the more polluting
trucks to carry freight.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a crisis, essentially, for the government, which has two
seemingly contradictory policies,'' said Green Party spokesman Yves
Cochet. He said the party planned to discuss whether its two
ecology ministers would step down from the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   The government has offered to give truckers a 20-cent
reimbursement per gallon of fuel this year, and a 14-cent refund
per liter on gasoline taxes next year. But the main union wants an
additional tax break of 5.6 centers per gallon in 2001, said a
statement by the National Federation of Truck Drivers, the
country's largest trucker union.
</P>
<P>
   Two of France's three principal freight unions refused to accept
the government's offer Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The truckers' federation rejected the government's offer as
''insufficient'' and vowed to continue its nationwide blockades.
</P>
<P>
   A smaller union, Transport and Logistics of France, signed a
deal with the government Wednesday, while the head of the nation's
second-largest union, UNOSTRA, left negotiations saying union
members had to continue consultations before accepting the
government's terms.
</P>
<P>
   The movement was expected to snowball Thursday, with ambulance
drivers, taxi drivers and farmers voicing demands for lower taxes.
Taxi drivers planned a protest in Paris, which would likely cause
traffic jams and a shortage of cabs around the capital.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday morning, taxis staged what they called ''Operation
Escargot,'' in which taxis driving in from Paris' airports slowed
their speed to a snail's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The truckers' protest was inspired by last week's strike by
fishermen, who blocked ports for several days. The demonstrations
ended when the Agriculture Ministry agreed to compensate them for
rising fuel prices.

<HEADLINE> Caesars president should be ousted, state says; his bosses disagree </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - He's the president of Caesars
Atlantic City Hotel Casino, a rising star who worked his way up
from craps dealer to a $325,000-a-year job as an executive with the
world's biggest casino company.
</P>
<P>
   He's also a compulsive gambler who ran up six-figure losses,
lied about it and defied a regulatory order banning him from
betting.
</P>
<P>
   Now New Jersey casino regulators must decide: Can a man like
this be trusted to run a casino?
</P>
<P>
   Or would revoking his license send the wrong message to other
problem gamblers who work in New Jersey's 12 casinos?
</P>
<P>
   The state Division of Gaming Enforcement recommended Wednesday
that Gary DiBartolomeo, 45, of Margate, be stripped of his casino
license.
</P>
<P>
   In a scathing 65-page report, Deputy Attorney General James
Fogarty listed nearly two dozen instances in which DiBartolomeo
violated a restriction banning him from gambling.
</P>
<P>
   At casinos in Nevada, Connecticut, Mississippi, the Bahamas and
Monte Carlo, he bet $345 to $1,527 per hand, running up debts of
$389,000 in one 18-month period.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to bet in Atlantic City casinos because he held a casino
key license, the highest level of license in New Jersey,
DiBartolomeo twice had a fellow Caesars worker act as his ''alter
ego'' at Trump Plaza, placing blackjack bets for him as he stood by
and watched.
</P>
<P>
   He gave $7,500 to Dennis Kim, director of Korean marketing at
Caesars, with the understanding that if he won, DiBartolomeo would
get the winnings and Kim would get a couple of hundred dollars for
helping him, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The report called DiBartolomeo financially irresponsible, noting
that he once needed a $90,000 loan from then-casino president Mark
Juliano to pay off one debt and that he needed advances on
forthcoming bonuses to make good.
</P>
<P>
   On other occasions, he took high-interest loans to hide his
losses from his wife and sold his wristwatches to come up with
money, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We ... are very concerned that his conduct and behavior
renders him vulnerable to situations and people that could cause
him to compromise the fair and honest performance of his duties or
otherwise have him engage in conduct inimical to the (Casino
Control) Act,'' Fogarty said.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey casino executives are allowed to gamble, but not in
New Jersey casinos. DiBartolomeo, however, was banned from gambling
anywhere in 1995, as a condition of the state Casino Control
Commission's renewal of his license.
</P>
<P>
   He also was ordered to attend weekly meetings of Gamblers
Anonymous, which he failed to do, according to the state report.
</P>
<P>
   Park Place Entertainment Corp., which owns Caesars, is standing
by its man.
</P>
<P>
   The company is asking the state Casino Control Commission to let
him return to work, provided he continues taking medication,
undergoes weekly psychotherapy sessions, performs 10 hours a month
of community service with the Council on Compulsive Gambling of New
Jersey and attends Gamblers Anonymous meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace Barr, executive vice president of Park Place
Entertainment, said DiBartolomeo is the first senior executive in
the casino industry ever to publicly admit to compulsive gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Revoking his license is too severe, Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Park Place is concerned that Mr. DiBartolomeo's unique human
condition is being handled as a law enforcement issue rather than a
serious health issue. And this will have far-reaching negative
implications for Gary and his family,'' Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard DeLury Jr., a Park Place Entertainment Corp. lawyer,
said Park Place officials didn't know about DiBartolomeo's problem
when they promoted him to the top job. When asked if he had any
license restrictions, he told them he didn't, DeLury said.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on compulsive gambling said Wednesday that DiBartolomeo
should be given another chance.
</P>
<P>
   ''A hard-line negative decision by the commission will impact
those employees in the future who might want to come forward
because of a gambling problem,'' said Edward Looney, executive
director of the Council on Compulsive Gambling. ''Without job
security, there would be little incentive to come forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnie Wexler, a former executive director of the Council on
Compulsive Gambling who now works as a private consultant, agreed.
One of the most important aspects of recovery is remaining on the
job, he said.
</P>
<P>
   DiBartolomeo, while higher-ranking than most, is far from alone,
according to Wexler.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are more people working behind the tables that are
compulsive gamblers, percentage-wise, than there are playing at the
tables,'' Wexler said.
</P>
<P>
   DiBartolomeo and his lawyer, Mark Sandson, criticized the state
report, saying it was needlessly harsh and painted a picture of
DiBartolomeo as a ''monster.''
</P>
<P>
   He committed no crimes, DiBartolomeo said in a telephone
interview Wednesday. He gambled legally, lost and paid his debts
with his substantial income, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an illness,'' he said. ''It's not moral. It's medical.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged lying and violating the commission's order
banning him from gambling, but he said he did so when he was in the
throes of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   He said he never gambled after being appointed president of
Caesars in January.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they strip me of my license, what kind of message is that
going to send out to other executives who are suffering from this
illness? And believe me, they're out there. Why come forward?''
</P>
<P>
   The state report was received by the Casino Control Commission
and remanded for a hearing, but no date was set. Commission
spokesman Daniel Heneghan said DiBartolomeo is pushing for an
expedited hearing.

<HEADLINE> Critics Howl on UK Millennium Dome  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Things could perhaps be worse for Britain's
Millennium Dome. But it's hard to see how.
</P>
<P>
   Outraged critics had a field day Wednesday after the
announcement of a $70 million public bailout for the giant
space-age structure on the Thames -- the latest in a series of woes
to plague the project.
</P>
<P>
   ''The time has come to pull the plug on Domefoolery,''
Conservative Party leader William Hague thundered a day after the
emergency infusion of cash was announced.
</P>
<P>
   Criticizing Prime Minister Tony Blair's government for
''throwing tens of thousands of pounds more into a black hole,''
Hague called for the dome's immediate shutdown and the firing of
the government minister responsible for it.
</P>
<P>
   London Mayor Ken Livingstone also jumped into the fray, telling
British Broadcasting Corp. radio he would never have built the $1.2
billion exhibition complex, which has drawn fewer visitors than
expected, garnered lukewarm reviews and gone through repeated
management shakeups.
</P>
<P>
   Press coverage was scathing. The Independent newspaper ran a
front-page photo of the riverside complex in southeast London,
dominated by ominous-looking gray clouds. ''Close it today,''
blared the tabloid Express.
</P>
<P>
   Conceived as a millennium attraction that would wow the world,
the dome debuted to enormous fanfare at New Year's, with Blair and
Queen Elizabeth II in attendance. But it was all downhill from
there.
</P>
<P>
   The project had already swallowed up more than $800 million in
government funding since its opening, and the latest bailout came
despite a pledge by the dome's management to seek no more public
cash.
</P>
<P>
   Dome operators, meanwhile, scrambled to deny that a company
backed by the Japanese investment bank Nomura International might
pull out of negotiations to take over the complex next year.
</P>
<P>
   Nomura said it hadn't been told ahead of time of Tuesday's
bailout, but a Nomura spokesman, Andrew Dowler, said plans to
acquire the site were moving ahead.
</P>
<P>
   David James, the dome's new executive chairman, expressed
confidence the deal would go through, and predicted that Nomura and
its partners would ''make a killing on this place.''
</P>
<P>
   But like almost everyone else embroiled in dome dealings these
days, James distanced himself from the complex's original planning
and previous finances. ''Nobody asked for my opinion at the
beginning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Falconer, the government minister responsible for the dome,
said closing it now would cost even more money, and cause the loss
of tens of thousands of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to stick with the project, and seek to deliver the
benefits that the project brings,'' he told BBC radio.

<HEADLINE> Campbell Soup reprises 'M'm! M'm! Good!' slogan in turnaround effort </HEADLINE>
By BRENDAN SCHURR
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - After letting its focus drift from its core
business and suffering three straight quarters of disappointing
earnings, Campbell Soup Co. on Wednesday resurrected its ''M'm!
M'm! Good!'' slogan in an effort to strengthen soup sales.
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest soup maker is relying on the slogan, which
hasn't been its advertising centerpiece in more than a decade, to
revive consumer interest in its ''icon'' soups: Chicken Noodle,
Tomato and Cream of Mushroom.
</P>
<P>
   The company's profits dropped 14 percent for the quarter that
ended in April. Campbell blamed that primarily on a sharp decline
in U.S. soup consumption and warned that earnings for the year
would probably fall short of expectations if the trend continued.
Earnings for the latest fiscal quarter are expected Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The company on Wednesday launched six new 30-second television
ads focusing on the condensed soups and a new ready-to-serve line.
The campaign will continue through April. Campbell also will
advertise in newspapers and on radio.
</P>
<P>
   The ads, which are part of the company's ''back to basics''
plan, will focus on the health benefits, wholesomeness and
convenience of the soups, including new pop-top cans on
ready-to-serve varieties.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said simply reprising the standby slogan won't be
enough to turn the struggling company around.
</P>
<P>
   ''They need to bring some news behind it,'' said David Nelson,
analyst with CS First Boston. ''Just saying the product is 'M'm!
M'm! Good!' if it's the same old product in the same old can at the
same old price, consumers will see right through that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said the company has not done enough to improve its
offerings to consumers, who face ever-increasing choices in
convenience foods.
</P>
<P>
   ''They haven't improved the quality or convenience
sufficiently,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To really turn the company around they need to invest in new
product innovation with substantial marketing behind it, Nelson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Condensed soup accounts for two-thirds of Campbell's ''wet
soup'' business, but consumers are ''moving beyond'' that, Nelson
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know that advertising is the quick fix for any of
this,'' said Terry Bivens, analyst with Bear Stearns, ''but it'll
help to put some marketing funds behind the condensed line.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the company spent $95 million on a campaign with the
tag line, ''We Have a Soup for That,'' but the company didn't
direct enough attention to the new product line itself, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They didn't really pull through on some of the new products
they had hoped to get,'' Bivens said. For example, the company
touted its ready-to-serve tomato soup, but had problems getting
enough containers.
</P>
<P>
   The new ad campaign is part of a plan that Campbell's announced
in May to focus on its primary product with new soup varieties,
more convenient packaging and increased marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The company has used the ''M'm! M'm! Good!'' slogan in some form
since the 1930s, but it has not played ''center stage'' in 16
years, said Andrew Hughson, president of the U.S. soups and sauces
division.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers, in testing, told the company that they associated the
slogan with the soup maker, Hughson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They said this is what we expect from Campbell,'' he said.
''It brings the positive of the past without being nostalgic.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell will highlight the fact that more than 30 of its soups
have fewer than 100 calories and 3 grams of fat per serving.
Campbell also will tout the addition of 20 percent more chicken in
Chicken Noodle Soup and the health benefits of its tomato soup. The
ads cite studies showing that ''diets rich in tomato products are
associated with reduced risk of certain types of cancers.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell declined to disclose its budget for the new campaign,
calling it a ''significant increase'' over past efforts.
</P>
<P>
   While the company has been struggling financially, it also is in
the midst of management changes. David W. Johnson, who was
president and chief executive from 1990 to 1997, returned to the
posts temporarily last year after Dale F. Morrison resigned.
</P>
<P>
   The board of directors is still seeking a new CEO, said company
spokesman John Faulkner.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Campbell were up 12.5 cents to close at $24.88 a share
Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> 38 people, 11 companies indicted in construction industry racketeering </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A Manhattan grand jury indicted 38 people and 11
companies Wednesday on charges of siphoning millions of dollars
from city construction projects through bribery, bid-rigging and
other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment said the defendants, called ''The Lucchese
Construction Group'' by investigators, illegally used nonunion
labor on eight public and private projects and paid workers less
than the legal wage.
</P>
<P>
   But the 57-count indictment, alleges crooked contractors in the
group billed public agencies and private developers as if they were
paying wages in compliance with the law.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between what the contractors billed the project
sponsors and their actual labor costs financed the bribes given to
corrupt union officials who let them use nonunion labor, District
Attorney Robert Morgenthau said.
</P>
<P>
   Morgenthau said the bribes constituted a ''mob tax'' of at least
5 percent of a contract's value, and the payoff was possible only
with the cooperation of the corrupt contractors.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the contractors didn't go along, the deal couldn't go
forward,'' Morgenthau said. ''These contractors knew what they were
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, federal prosecutors announced a six-count indictment
which names six defendants, all of whom are named in the state
indictment, and charges them with basically the same crimes charged
by the state.
</P>
<P>
   Morgenthau said he was unaware of the federal indictment, but
said it is not unusual for state and federal officials to run
parallel investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Morgenthau said 31 of the 38 state defendants were in custody
and the others were being sought. He said they include three groups
- Lucchese crime family members and associates, union members, and
contractors.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants were to be arraigned late Wednesday in
Manhattan's State Supreme Court. All are charged with enterprise
corruption, which is punishable by up to 25 years in prison, and
with related crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Under the federal indictments, the six defendants are charged
with conspiracies involving wire fraud or extortion or both. They
face prison terms that range from five to 20 years on each count
upon conviction. They are scheduled to be arraigned on Sept. 14 in
Manhattan's U.S. District Court, said Marvin Smilon, spokesman for
U.S. Attorney's Office.
</P>
<P>
   The state indictment charges that during the three years of the
investigation, defendants created ''no-show'' and ''no-work''
positions for ''made'' (formally inducted) mobsters of the Lucchese
crime family.
</P>
<P>
   Those jobs, in which the ''worker'' does not show up, or if he
shows up he does not work, were meant to provide what appeared to
be a legitimate income, as well as medical coverage and pension
benefits, for the employee.
</P>
<P>
   Three public projects investigated during the three-year probe
included two school construction jobs in Queens and one in the
Bronx, worth a total of $32 million and paid for by the state
School Construction Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Two other projects paid for with a total of $1 million in public
money included road resurfacing at the Triborough Bridge, and road
resurfacing and cable repair on the Queensborough Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The three privately financed projects included the renovation of
the Park Central Hotel at Seventh Avenue and 56th Street, the
construction of the Doral Arrowwood Conference Center in Ryebrook,
N.Y., and the addition of five floors of apartments in the building
at 354 Broadway.

<HEADLINE> Judiciary Opposes Camera Bill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bill aimed at cracking open federal
courtroom doors to television, radio and photo coverage got a
Senate subcommittee hearing Wednesday, but a chief sponsor of the
proposed legislation acknowledged it faces major hurdles -- among
them the chairman of the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa and chairman of a subcommittee on
courts oversight, said the bill he and Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.,
introduced seeks ''to let the sun shine in on our federal courts.''
</P>
<P>
   But Edward Becker, a federal appellate judge from Philadelphia,
testified that the U.S. Judicial Conference, the federal
judiciary's policymaking body, vigorously opposes the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our mission is to administer the highest possible quality of
justice to each and every litigant,'' Becker said. ''We cannot
tolerate even a little bit of unfairness based on media coverage,
notwithstanding that society as a whole might in some way benefit,
for that would be inconsistent with our mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Becker questioned the educational value of having broadcast
coverage of federal trials and appellate hearings, contending that
the public most often would see only snippets of such proceedings.
''The courtroom is just a backdrop,'' he contended. ''What you get
out of this is a lot of nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer said that same logic could lead federal judges to
conclude that the public and print news media should be banned from
all trials. The Supreme Court has ruled that the public and news
media have a constitutional right to attend courtroom proceedings,
specifically criminal trials.
</P>
<P>
   ''Public exposure of the processes of government is almost
always in the public interest,'' Schumer said.
</P>
<P>
   A federal trial judge, Nancy Gertner of Boston, testified in
favor of the bill. ''When the majority of Americans get their
information through a screen, our obligation to make proceedings
public has to include allowing those proceedings to be televised,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would let presiding judges decide whether to allow
electronic media coverage on a case-by-case basis. ''It's curious
to me that the Judicial Conference argues for more judicial
discretion all the time, but doesn't trust its judges to make
decisions regarding cameras in the courtroom,'' Grassley said.
</P>
<P>
   Another subcommittee member Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., also
supported the legislation. But Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah and
chairman of the full Senate Judiciary Committee, released a
statement citing his agreement with the Judicial Conference that
''cameras and electronic media in the courtroom could interfere
with the federal courts' primary mission of dispensing justice.''
</P>
<P>
   In a brief interview after the two-hour hearing ended, Grassley
cited Hatch's opposition and said he did not plan to take the bill
to the full Judiciary Committee before 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The House passed a similar measure recently but that bill would
require the consent of all parties in a case before federal judges
could allow electronic media coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is S. 721.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Ends Down 130; Dow Gains 50  </HEADLINE>
By LISA SINGHANIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Tech stocks tumbled for a second straight
session Wednesday as analysts cut their ratings on several
high-profile companies, while blue chips moved higher on news of a
major deal in the financial services industry.
</P>
<P>
   The high-tech driven Nasdaq composite index was off 129.84 at
4,013.34.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 50.03 at 11,310.64,
and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 14.83 at 1,492.25.
</P>
<P>
   Tech stocks fell for a second day, primarily because of more
analyst downgrades of prominent companies. On Tuesday, the
high-tech stocks slipped after a prominent analyst lowered his
rating onf Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Micron Technology fell $9.50 to $68.75 Wednesday after
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette lowered its rating on the memory
chipmaker from ''buy'' to ''underperform.''
</P>
<P>
   And telecom provider WorldCom fell $2.25 to $31.50 after
analysts from Lehman Brothers and Wachovia Securities downgraded
the stock.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think those downgrades are concerning people about
third-quarter earnings, so you're seeing weakness in those
stocks,'' said Barry Berman, managing director of equity trading
for Robert W. Baird &AMP; Co. in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of MP3.com fell 69 cents -- more than 8 percent -- to $7.88
after a federal judge ruled Wednesday that the company had
willfully violated copyrights of music companies and awarded
Universal Music Group $25,000 per CD, a penalty that could reach as
much as $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo!, which has been on a slide in recent sessions, fell $5.06
to $112.06, and continued to fall in after-hours trading, after the
company's CEO said at an investment conference that the Internet
company plans to cut back advertising spending.
</P>
<P>
   With tech stocks already in a slump, the news from Yahoo! could
prompt continued selling when trading begins on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks were also a focus Wednesday after Citigroup,
the nation's biggest financial services company, said it was buying
lender Associates First Capital for about $31.1 billion in stock.
The deal should speed Citigroup's global expansion in lending to
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup, a Dow component, fell $3.02 to $54.92, but shares of
Associates First Capital jumped $10.50, nearly 37.5 percent, to
$38.50.
</P>
<P>
   The news increased speculation that Deutsche Bank might be
eyeing J.P. Morgan as a potential takeover target. Shares of
Morgan, also a Dow component, closed up $7.81 at $167.75; its
advance accounted for much of the Dow's rise Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said a government report showing higher U.S.
productivity had little effect on trading although it bolstered the
belief that interest rates will remain stable for the near future.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department said Americans' productivity, a key measure
of rising living standards, surged at a 5.7 percent annual rate in
the second quarter. The strong gain pushed unit labor costs, a key
gauge of inflation pressures, down by a rate of 0.4 percent, the
lowest since the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, crude for delivery in October surpassed the
previous 10-year high of $34.37 on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, reaching $34.45 before declining somewhat to $34.35.
</P>
<P>
   Higher oil prices are considered by some to be a potential
inflationary pressure, but at least one analyst wasn't worried.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this truly was a long-term inflationary threat, that would
be showing up at the bond market in the form of higher interest
rates and we don't see that happening,'' said Alan Skrainka, chief
market strategist at Edward Jones of St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange. Consolidated volume on the Big Board came
to 992.3 million shares, ahead of Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 2.70 at 536.21.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.32 percent.
Germany's DAX index was down 0.84 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was
down 0.86 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 0.87 percent.

<HEADLINE> Groups go to court in effort to stop bear hunt  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Animal rights advocates and a northern New
Jersey town asked an appellate court Wednesday to overrule a state
regulation ordering the first bear hunt in nearly 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Animal Rights Alliance, the town of West Milford
and some residents filed an appeal to the state Fish and Game
Council's order to allow hunters to shoot black bear beginning
Sept. 18.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge filed with the Superior Court's appellate division
argues that the Fish and Game Council, a policy arm of the state
Division of Fish and Wildlife, does not have the legal authority to
order a hunt, and should have conducted more research about
alternatives to bear hunting.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have not followed through on what they are legislatively
mandated to do, as far as the scientific research,'' said Janine
Motta, a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Animal Rights Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The Fish and Game Council ordered the first bear hunt in 29
years to curb a population it has estimated at more than 1,000.
Residents in northern New Jersey, the heart of the bear population,
have complained the animals have broken into cars and homes, killed
pets, destroyed property and scared people.
</P>
<P>
   The hunt's opponents say the division has overestimated the
number of bears and hasn't researched enough alternatives to
hunting them, such as birth control and deterrence.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 towns, including West Milford, have passed
resolutions opposing a bear hunt. Most residents are not threatened
by the animals creeping around, said William Strazza, a Union
Township attorney who filed the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a quality of life issue,'' Strazza said. ''People who
choose to live in that area in part are doing it because they
choose to live amongst wildlife.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the state Department of Environmental
Protection, which the Fish and Wildlife Division is part of,
declined comment on the challenge Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The state Senate overwhelmingly passed a bill to cancel the
hunt, but the Assembly did not take up the bill before it ended its
session for the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Strazza said he will ask DEP Commissioner Robert Shinn within
two days to postpone the hunt until the appeal is heard. If Shinn
refuses, he said he will seek an emergency hearing before an
appellate judge to postpone the hunt.
</P>
<P>
   The state has begun how-to seminars for hunters who are
accustomed to shooting at deer to make sure they are prepared to
shoot the much larger bear. The hunt is limited to 175 bear for the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say that even if they learn how to shoot them, the
hunters can't be sure they're killing the bears who are causing
problems with residents.
</P>
<P>
   ''The one who's in the woods and was killed was killed,'' Motta
said. ''The one who's in your back yard, he didn't learn that he
was not supposed to go into your back yard and eat birdseed. Nobody
learned anything except there's a dead bear in the woods.''

<HEADLINE> Sen. Pushes To Close Loophole  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration should move quickly
to close a Medicaid loophole that lets states inflate how much they
are spending for medical services to generate large federal
reimbursements, the Senate Finance Committee chairman said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has turned a program intended to provide health insurance
coverage to vulnerable low-income pregnant women, children, senior
citizens and individuals with disabilities into a bank account for
state projects having nothing to do with health care,'' said Sen.
William Roth, R-Del. ''Let me be very clear, this cannot and will
not be permitted to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials have said the loophole has the potential to
cost the government tens of billions of dollars in overpayments.
This year, the government is estimated to lose $2 billion under the
loophole, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Westmoreland, director of the Center for Medicaid and
State Operations for the Health Care Financing Administration, told
lawmakers the agency hoped to have a proposed rule to close the
loophole issued by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   While some states have used the extra money for health related
projects, Westmoreland said several states have used to extra money
to fill budget gaps, reduce the state debt and even pay for
education programs. Because there is a loophole in the law, such
practices are not considered illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ''These practices. . . are inconsistent with the Medicaid
statute, congressional intent and administration policy,''
Westmoreland said.
</P>
<P>
   And Michael Mangano, principal deputy inspector general for the
Health and Human Services Department, said, ''We believe that
widespread manipulation by states. . . could undermine the
stability of the Medicaid program.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's how the loophole works. The Medicaid program, the
government's health care program for the poor, is a joint project
with the federal government paying at least 50 percent of the
costs. States with larger poor populations get a larger share from
the federal government. States set the amount they will pay health
providers, but the federal government provides a cap for payments.
</P>
<P>
   Under the loophole, a state will charge the maximum amount for
services at a local or county-owned facility even though the
services may actually cost substantially lower. The additional
money is then transferred back to the state and used for a number
of projects.
</P>
<P>
   There are currently 20 states with plans in place that allow
them to take advantage of the loophole, federal officials said.
Several others have plans pending to participate.
</P>
<P>
   States eligible to use the loophole are Alabama, California,
Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota,
Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina,
North Dakota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee,
Washington and New Jersey.

<HEADLINE> Nothing New in Estonia Ferry Film  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL TARM
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLINN, Estonia (AP) -- Investigators of the Estonia ferry
accident that killed 852 people have studied new underwater film
footage of the 1994 wreck and say they saw nothing to warrant a
fresh probe.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can say there are no new facts requiring a new
investigation. None at all,'' said Kari Lehtola, a Finnish member
of the tri-nation commission that investigated the maritime
disaster, Europe's worst since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 report by the Estonian-Finnish-Swedish commission blamed
the ferry's sinking in the Baltic Sea on faulty locks on the 50-ton
bow door and a slow reaction from the crew. But conspiracy theories
abound, including that a bomb exploded on board.
</P>
<P>
   Many survivors and victims' relatives have pressed for a new
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Four other official investigators who screened a half-hour
excerpt of the film, taken by a privately funded diving expedition
last week, all agreed nothing new was disclosed, according to
Finnish investigator Tuomo Karppinen.
</P>
<P>
   The film was shot by a diving team led by Gregg Bemis Jr., a
businessman from New Mexico who claimed that he may have found a
hole in the hull, possibly indicating a blast sank the ship.
</P>
<P>
   A 30-second segment of the alleged hole was previewed Monday. An
elongated black spot was visible on the hull but it wasn't clearly
a hole.
</P>
<P>
   Karppinen said Tuesday the alleged hole was most likely a
shadow.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before Mr. Bemis went down, he said he'd show the world an
explosion hole. So what's he showing us now? Footage of a sandbed
and a shadow. That's his hole,'' Karppinen said.
</P>
<P>
   The Estonia sank quickly to more than 250 feet deep in a Sept.
28, 1994, storm off the coast of Finland as it was en route from
Tallinn to Stockholm, Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   In Stockholm, Swedish Deputy Industry Minister Mona Sahlin said
it was too early to comment on the potential for a new inquiry, but
the government and opposition parties had agreed to send experts to
review the footage.

<HEADLINE> Study: Cop Program May Miss Goal  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federally financed study concluded Wednesday
that President Clinton's program to put 100,000 police officers on
the street focused on the highest crime areas and fostered
community policing but estimated it might fall short of its
numerical goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's Tom Frazier, director of the Community
Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program, responded that
additional grants had been made and technical assistance improved
since the researchers stopped gathering data in mid-1998. Frazier
predicted the six-year, $8.8 billion program would put 100,000 more
officers on the street by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the numerical dispute, Jeffrey Roth, director of the
Urban Institute's crime control policy studies, said his study
found that COPS ''had broad national impact on the levels and
styles of policing'' and its resources ''went where they were most
needed: high-crime areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the study did not try to quantify the program's impact
on crime, Roth said, ''We cannot rule out the possibility the
program accounts for part of the drop in national crime
statistics'' since the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The evaluation by the Urban Institute, a private research group,
was funded by the Justice Department's National Institute of
Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Justice Department's inspector general predicted
the program would fall 40,000 short of the original goal of putting
100,000 additional state and local cops on the street by the end of
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, administration officials have altered their claims.
They now say that by May 1999 they completed funding of state and
local police department applications to hire or free from desk work
100,000 more officers.
</P>
<P>
   But the hiring and training new officers or hiring civilians or
buying equipment that would allow existing officers to move from
behind desks to street work can delay the arrival of new cops on
the street for up to several years, the administration says.
</P>
<P>
   Enacted in 1994, COPS provides money to state and local
departments to pay up to 75 percent of each new officer's salary
and benefits for three years. The departments are required to
submit a plan for retaining the new officers after that with their
own money, but not all of them have been retained.
</P>
<P>
   Citing data through mid-1998, the Urban Institute estimated that
because of retention problems and limited productivity gains from
new technology the program would reach a peak of between 69,000 and
84,600 new or transferred officers on the streets in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The institute estimated the long-term increase would fall to
between 62,800 and 83,900 new or transferred officers in 2003 and
beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ''To those who considered the level of policing in 1994
inadequate,'' the report said, ''this constitutes success, though
it falls well short of the Clinton administration's target of
100,000 new cops on the beat.'' The report said the exact increase
in officers may never be known because of the difficulty in
measuring the transfers of officers to the street that result from
productivity gains.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that the one percent of COPS grantees with the
highest murder rates received 31 percent of all funds through 1997.
These areas accounted for 54 percent of all U.S. murders that year.
</P>
<P>
   The report credited the program with energizing a national
movement toward community policing, in which police officers work
with citizen, government, church and business groups on crime
prevention and problem-solving.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few departments actually shared decision-making with
community groups, but many launched truancy prevention efforts,
foot or bicycle patrols or late-night recreation programs, among
others.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Coca Production Said High  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the new $1.3 billion U.S.
counternarcotics program for Colombia still in the planning stages,
coca production there continues to ''skyrocket,'' and no
significant reductions are expected until 2002, administration
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Barry McCaffrey, director of the White House drug control
office, said that while CIA estimates won't be available for four
months, anecdotal evidence suggests there will be an increase this
year over the official 520-metric ton estimate for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey and a number of other administration officials briefed
reporters on key aspects of the U.S. program a week after President
Clinton visited Colombia in a show of solidarity with President
Andrews Pastrana's efforts to defeat drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana hopes to earmark $7.5 billion over three years to fight
the drug trade, stimulate the economy and reform the judiciary,
among other goals. He expects to generate $4 billion locally and
use $3.5 billion from the United States and other countries. About
$300 million of the U.S. contribution will be earmarked for
nonmilitary purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia is by far the world's largest supplier of cocaine and
also is an emerging major source of heroin.
</P>
<P>
   Under Secretary of State Thomas Pickering said the forthcoming
CIA coca production estimates cannot be viewed as a measure of the
success of the U.S. effort because implementation has yet to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Beers, the State Department's top counterdrug official,
said 18 Huey helicopters in Colombia were idled when funding ran
out earlier this year but should be ready to resume operations in
two to three months. Another 15 Hueys will be sent to Colombia
during the first two months of 2001, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the 33 helicopters will be able to provide mobility for
one U.S.-trained Colombian counternarcotics battalion and another
which should be ready for duty early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia can expect to receive additional Hueys, plus Blackhawk
helicopters, during the latter part of 2001, he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said that based on anecdotal evidence such as
satellite photos and other indicators, ''the production of cocaine
in Colombia is continuing to skyrocket.'' He said he anticipates
that early next year, once the official analyses are completed,
''we're going to see more bad news out of Colombia.''
</P>
<P>
   Beers said the joint U.S.-Colombian effort is expected to level
off coca production by the end of 2001, and bring a ''dramatic
reduction'' a year later.

<HEADLINE> Wireless Auction Challenge Nixed  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators denied a challenge
Wednesday to a fall auction of valuable chunks of the airwaves that
companies are eyeing for wireless phone and Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission said Wednesday it plans to
go forward with a re-auction of frequencies that were awarded
several years ago to NextWave Telecom, a company that later filed
for bankruptcy. The FCC declared that the licenses held by NextWave
were automatically canceled because the company had failed to meet
its payment deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   The commission announced Wednesday it would re-auction the
licenses -- expected to fetch the government billions of dollars in
bids -- on Dec. 12, pushing the auction back slightly from a
previously scheduled date.
</P>
<P>
   NextWave had petitioned the agency to reconsider its decision to
cancel the company's licenses and re-auction them. NextWave had
offered to pay its debt in full and argued that the commission
acted unlawfully by revoking licenses while the business was trying
to reorganize.
</P>
<P>
   ''Commission review presented a good opportunity to end the
litigation and allow NextWave to put its spectrum licenses to use
immediately to benefit consumers and competition,'' said Michael
Wack, NextWave's deputy general counsel. ''The interests of
consumers, taxpayers and NextWave's creditors and investors could
have been harmonized in a win-win resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Wack said the company plans to appeal the FCC's decision to the
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and will
likely seek a stay of the auction.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has held firm that it must protect the integrity
of the auction process by requiring bidders to meet their payment
deadlines. FCC officials fear that allowing bankrupt companies to
hold on to the licenses -- and eventually pay only a portion of what
they bid -- will undermine the entire process and stall the rollout
of future wireless services.
</P>
<P>
   ''Enabling American consumers to access the Internet with
handheld wireless devices is one of the most exciting advances in
telecommunications,'' said FCC Chairman William Kennard Wednesday.
''We can ill afford to delay bringing new communications services
to the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the licenses are worth billions more now than the
$4 billion NextWave originally bid for them because of the
increasing demand for wireless voice and data services. The
upcoming re-auction will allow the nation's largest wireless
companies to also vie for some the frequencies, which were
originally reserved for small businesses. That means businesses
like Verizon Wireless, SBC Communications and others can bid on
certain licenses under the modified auction rules.

<HEADLINE> Officials have ambitious proposals, but time is limited  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Christie Whitman wants new campaign
finance laws by Election Day. She also has plans for health care
reform.
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco, R-Union, wants his $400
million property tax reform plan approved. He also has a $60
million prescription drug proposal in the works.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Jack Collins, R-Salem, says he has ideas for
the fall legislative session on education and school construction.
</P>
<P>
   But the state Senate's first voting session is Sept. 21, and the
Assembly isn't due back until Oct. 5.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not optimistic,'' Assembly Minority Leader Joseph V.
Doria, Jr. said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   That's not partisan politics from the Hudson County Democrat.
It's pragmatism.
</P>
<P>
   ''The time for us to do these things is really limited,'' Doria
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even bipartisan slam dunks like health care and property tax
relief still need to be reviewed by committees in both houses and
approved by the Legislature, Doria said.
</P>
<P>
   As appealing as property tax relief sounds, legislators still
need to examine DiFrancesco's proposals, Doria said.
</P>
<P>
   ''In order for us to do our jobs responsibly, we need to
carefully review the things that are being presented to us,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   DiFrancesco's $400 million tax relief plan would raise the
Homestead Rebate for the first time in 10 years and double the NJ
Saver rebate. DiFrancesco also wants to put $100 million over three
years into grants for direct municipal property tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   His $60 million drug plan would offer middle-income seniors and
disabled residents low-cost prescriptions. Another $60 million in
programs include funding for hospital charity care programs,
Medicaid reimbursements to physicians and emergency room clinics in
urban hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is an ambitious agenda,'' DiFrancesco spokeswoman Rae
Hutton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The intent in unveiling it late this summer was so we could
hit the ground running in the fall,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   DiFrancesco will make ''every effort'' to have the majority of
the bills pass the Senate by early December, Hutton said. The
prescription drug measure is designed to be working by February,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators already have cleared major issues like funding for
the Transportation Trust Fund and court-ordered school
construction, Collins said. With those major issues hurdled,
lawmakers can focus on other measures, including tax relief and
health care, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's the best way to do that, that's what we'll be talking
about,'' the Assembly speaker said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman announced Aug. 29 her plans to change campaign finance
law and a state panel to aid patients in challenging HMO insurance
decisions. Disappointed patients should be able to sue insurance
companies, Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   Another consumer protection proposal would target home
improvement contractors. If it becomes law, all contractors would
be registered with the state. Whitman also wants to increase
criminal penalties for consumer fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whatever the governor wants us to take a look at, we will,''
Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman spokeswoman Jayne O'Connor said the governor believes
the campaign finance package can become law by early November. The
other issues should see action by the end of the fall, O'Connor
said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman is not daunted by the fact no hearings have been
scheduled or bills posted.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's still committed to that time frame,'' the spokeswoman
said.

<HEADLINE> Cholera bacteria found in Ocean City lagoon  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OCEAN CITY, N.J. (AP) - A series of tests have determined the
presence of cholera bacteria in a lagoon where a victim reported
swimming before his diagnosis with the disease, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   All six samples of water taken from the 17th Street lagoon along
Ocean City's back bay showed Vibrio cholera bacteria, a
non-epidemic type of cholera, according to Louis Lamanna, public
health coordinator for Cape May County.
</P>
<P>
   The bacteria matched what was found in the stool of an
unidentified 30-year-old Ocean City man treated for cholera last
month. He was hospitalized but survived the rare intestinal
disease, which can be fatal.
</P>
<P>
   The samples were taken Aug. 24. A new round of samples were
taken at 18th Street and in the open water at the mouth of the two
lagoons, Lamanna said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are anxious to gather more information to see how
widespread this problem is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lamanna said the findings do not necessarily mean the man
contracted the disease from swimming in the lagoon. He told
officials he swam there with his dog, but he also said he ate
undercooked softshell crabs and raw clams shortly before he became
sick.
</P>
<P>
   His physician, Dr. Athanasios Papastamelos of Linwood, has said
he believes tainted shellfish was to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't say for sure whether he got it from the water or from
the seafood. He may have gotten a double whammy, or both. Or it may
be one of those where we never know how he got it,'' Lamanna said.
</P>
<P>
   Normally associated with exposure to untreated water or sewage,
cholera is rare in the United States. According to the federal
Centers for Disease Control, about five people in the nation are
diagnosed with it annually.
</P>
<P>
   Swimming and bathing in the lagoon, already discouraged by city
officials, is now prohibited by order of the county health
department.
</P>
<P>
   Residents, meanwhile, are keeping a wide berth. Some won't even
let their dogs swim in the lagoon anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have Jet Skis and Waverunners and we won't take them out,''
said Kathy Gillespie, 24, a summer resident of 17th Street. ''I
have a chocolate Labrador and I won't let him go in, either. I
don't want cholera.''

<HEADLINE> Pattern of child abuse noted by doctor in death penalty case  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WATERBURY, Conn. (AP) - A man accused of beating his
girlfriend's 2-year-old daughter to death listened Wednesday as a
doctor testified about the severe abuse the toddler suffered in the
days before she died.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors claim Ivo Colon, 20, killed Keriana Tellado on July
17, 1998 by smashing her head repeatedly against a shower wall. He
has pleaded innocent to charges of murder and capital felony. Colon
could face the death penalty if convicted, because the victim was a
child.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Jacoby, the head of the emergency department at St.
Mary's Hospital, used a dozen photos of Keriana's body to show the
jury injuries that ranged from a broken arm to a mark behind her
ear - an indication, he said, of a severe blow to the head. Other
gouges, scratch marks, bruises and discolorations crisscrossed her
body. A chunk of skin was missing from the top of her shoulder, and
some hair had been pulled from her scalp, Jacoby said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The child was abused. This child had injuries in various
stages of development,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Colon reportedly told investigators he couldn't deal with the
child's lack of toilet training.
</P>
<P>
   Family members packed the courtroom on the opening day of the
trial, sometimes making emotional outbursts. Many wore T-shirts
that showed a picture of Keriana and read: ''In memory of Keriana
1-27-96 to 7-17-98.''
</P>
<P>
   The girl's father, Francisco Tellado, said he wants Colon to be
executed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just wish the jury would get to the deliberations and get to
the death penalty. The fact is that he did it, and the defense is
trying to twist everything around,'' Tellado said.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's mother, Virginia Quintero, is charged with failing to
protect her daughter and lying to police about what happened. She
is being tried separately and may be called to testify against
Colon.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital notes show that Keriana was blue and cold when she came
into the emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby said when an emergency room worker questioned Quintero
about what happened, she said Keriana fell in the shower.
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby said he did not think that statement was true, since the
girl's hair was dry and she had injuries all over her body.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor, Juana Rivera, testified that Colon came to her
apartment the day Keriana died and asked to use the telephone to
call his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said, 'My baby got hurt,''' Rivera said, adding that he
later said Keriana had fallen out of a window.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera said she told Colon to call police or an ambulance, but
he called his mother instead to pick up the child.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera testified that she saw Keriana as Colon's mother was
taking her out of the apartment house.
</P>
<P>
   ''The baby's eyes was turned back. She was bruised. The skin
tone was yellowish,'' Rivera said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the girl's mother and a sister, Crystal Tellado,
''looked scared.'' She noticed a big bruise on Crystal's leg.
</P>
<P>
   Before Quintero started seeing Colon, she and her three
preschool-aged daughters were frequently seen around the apartment
house, Rivera said. The girls' grandmother cared for them while
Quintero was at work.
</P>
<P>
   After Colon moved in, Rivera said she rarely saw the girls.
</P>
<P>
   A jury of seven women and five men was chosen to hear the case
before Superior Court Judge Frank D'Addabbo.

<HEADLINE> Penn Traffic still reels from reorganization but is improving  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - Still reeling from its restructuring, Penn
Traffic on Wednesday reported a net loss for the second quarter of
$23.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   However, Penn Traffic said its earnings for the quarter before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization - a popular
financial measure also known as ''EBITDA'' - were $28.2 million, an
increase of 12.7 percent over the second quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has now been more than a year since our company completed
its financial restructuring and we began implementing a business
strategy designed to generate sales and operating income growth,''
said Joseph V. Fisher, chief executive officer for the troubled
supermarket chain. ''Our same-store sales were positive in the
first half of this fiscal year.''
</P>
<P>
   The company said the EBITDA rise stemmed from a 1.3 percent
increase in same-store sales, an increase in allowance income from
the company's vendors, and the benefits of numerous cost-saving
measures.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues for the second quarter were approximately $629.7
million, compared to $632.7 million a year ago, a decrease of a
half percent.
</P>
<P>
   The company said its $100 million, 18-month capital expenditure
program was proceeding on schedule. Since the beginning of the
fiscal year, Penn Traffic has completed 14 major store remodelings.
Nine have re-opened since the beginning of the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Penn Traffic announced a program to buy back up to $10
million of its common stock. So far, it has repurchased 48,000
shares at an average price of $7.15 per share, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Penn Traffic owns and operates 220 supermarkets in upstate New
York, Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Vermont and New Hampshire
under the Big Bear, Big Bear Plus, Bi-Lo, Quality, and P&AMP;C names.
It also operates wholesale food distribution businesses serving 84
licensed franchises and 65 independent operators.

<HEADLINE> Officials: Joel O'Keefe caught prepping for next escape attempt  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DANNEMORA, N.Y. (AP) - Inmate Joel O'Keefe is back in solitary
Wednesday after officials at Clinton Correctional Facility say they
found him allegedly squirreling makeshift hooks and ropes.
</P>
<P>
   O'Keefe, 40, formerly of Argyle in Washington County, bolted
from a State Police car on Sept. 23, 1994, Hundreds of police
combed the area for more than two weeks, using helicopters and
police dogs. But O'Keefe dodged the dragnet, making his way to
Bennington, Vt., and wasn't captured until a Subway sandwich shop
clerk recognized him ordering a six-inch meatball sub.
</P>
<P>
   After four years housed in administrative segregation at Attica
Correctional Facility, a court settlement required O'Keefe be
permitted to mix with other prisoners. He was moved to Clinton in
December of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   According to state Department of Correctional Services
Commissioner Glenn Goord, a correction officer saw a suspicious
looking bag among a group of unattended bags by the mess hall about
7:30 a.m. Tuesday. The officer noted that O'Keefe picked up the bag
about 7:30 a.m. Tuesday as he was heading toward a work assignment
in the facility tailor shop.
</P>
<P>
   A search of the bag revealed an 8-inch wide by 14-inch long
plywood grappling hook attached to an approximately 25-foot long
hand-woven cloth. Guards found three more pieces of cloth tied
together under O'Keefe's desk in the tailor shop, prison officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last year, a court settlement required that I take (O'Keefe)
out of administrative segregation and place him in less-restrictive
general confinement housing,'' Goord said. ''Today's discovery
validates our decision to place O'Keefe in restrictive housing.''
That settlement also required the state to pay O'Keefe $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two weeks ago, prison officials denied O'Keefe's
request to attend his father's funeral. O'Keefe told officials he
attempted the escape because he was ''despondent'' about missing
the event.
</P>
<P>
   O'Keefe was convicted of burglary based on charges he sodomized
a woman at knifepoint. Those charges plus the escape charges
resulted in sentences totaling 10 to 20 years in state prison.
</P>
<P>
   O'Keefe now faces charges of attempted escape and possession of
prison contraband.

<HEADLINE> Hamilton Twp. teachers ordered back to work; no other strikes expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAMILTON, N.J. (AP) - A state Superior Court judge Wednesday
ordered striking teachers in the Hamilton Township district to go
back to work Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Anthony J. Parrillo at a hearing Wednesday afternoon also
ordered the township school board to hold a negotiating session
with the teachers union within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Joseph, a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Education
Association, said teacher contracts are yet to be settled in 80
other districts in the state, but no other strikes are expected.
</P>
<P>
   The Hamilton Township Education Association, representing about
1,450 teachers and other staff in the Mercer County district, went
on strike Wednesday morning. Schools in the district, which has
13,000 students, opened, but students were told to go home a short
time later.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey School Boards Association condemned the strike
and criticized the union for using ''students as pawns in its
attempts to influence the negotiations process.''
</P>
<P>
   The township school board asked the judge to issue a temporary
restraining order barring the teachers from striking. He did so at
a 2 p.m. court hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph said the union has scheduled a meeting for 5:30 a.m.
Thursday to discuss the judge's order.
</P>
<P>
   The union represents teachers, aides, custodians, bus drivers,
and clerical and cafeteria workers.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Schwartz, president of the Hamilton Township Education
Association, said the union and school board have not agreed on
salary increases. The union has requested 5 percent raises in each
of the three years of the contract; the board has offered raises of
4 percent in the first year of the contract, 4.1 percent in the
second year and 4.2 percent in the third year.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz also said the board ''isn't willing to treat our
members equally, when it comes to discussing certain benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Messages left at Board of Education offices were not returned
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph said the Hamilton Township Education Association and the
Board of Education have had four negotiating sessions.
</P>
<P>
   A state-appointed mediator has assisted in the negotiations, the
School Boards Association said.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of districts throughout the state settled contracts in
recent weeks. Of the 186 public school districts where teacher
contracts were to be renewed, 80 were not settled as of Wednesday.
Two weeks ago, teachers in 117 districts were without contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ''They do settle this time of year,'' Joseph said. ''As school
opens it's important that school employees go back with a
contract.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to salaries and benefits, many of the districts are
negotiating the length of the work day. Districts are seeking to
increase instructional time to help them meet new curriculum
standards, said Frank Belluscio, spokesman for the school boards
association.
</P>
<P>
   The average teacher salary increase for the 2000-2001 school
year was 4 percent. The average teacher salary in New Jersey was
$51,692 for the 1998-99 school year, the latest figure available.

<HEADLINE> Iran Parliament To Probe Attacks  </HEADLINE>
By ALI AKBAR DAREINI
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Iran's reformist-controlled parliament voted
Wednesday to investigate attacks on a student pro-democracy seminar
last month that led to rioting and the death of a policeman.
</P>
<P>
   A majority in the 290-seat parliament voted in favor of
launching an investigation into clashes that erupted in the western
city of Khorramabad when hard-line vigilantes attacked the meeting
of Iran's largest reformist student group.
</P>
<P>
   Several legislators will travel to Khorramabad to investigate
the violence later this month, said lawmaker Rajabali Mazrouei. He
gave no further details.
</P>
<P>
   The students' Office for Fostering Unity ended its annual
weeklong seminar two days early after the attack when provincial
authorities said they would not be able to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's judiciary, which is controlled by hard-liners, launched
an investigation into the unrest last month but is yet to issue a
report on its findings.
</P>
<P>
   But student leaders said they had little faith in the
judiciary's fairness and that a parliamentary investigation was
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ''The parliament is the best body to probe the savagery
committed by pressure groups. But investigation alone is not
enough. We want the establishment to deal with the perpetrators,''
Ebrahim Sheikh, a leader of the Office for Fostering Unity, told
The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   ''Usually the verdicts issued by judiciary officials are in line
with their political affiliations and not with justice,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-liners control key government institutions, including the
broadcast networks, the military and police and have been trying to
stifle the social and political reforms initiated by President
Mohammad since he took office in 1997. In recent months,
hard-liners have closed down 24 reformist newspapers and jailed
dozens of writers and intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
   Student groups are currently at the forefront of the fight for
reforms, which are backed by a large majority of Iranians.

<HEADLINE> Surveillance Laws Targeted on Hill  </HEADLINE>
By D. IAN HOPPER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Shocked at how simple it is for law
enforcement to get court permission to see the telephone numbers
people dial, legislators Wednesday discussed new bills aimed at
tightening surveillance laws and put final touches on a plan to
address workplace privacy.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed wiretap bill would make it more difficult for
prosecutors to obtain court permission to monitor the telephone
numbers dialed by a suspect. The bill would require the same
standard of evidence now needed for permission to tap a telephone
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Two very similar bills, the Electronic Communications Privacy
Act and the Digital Privacy Act, spawned from citizen concerns
about their privacy online. Recent revelations about Carnivore, a
law enforcement tool that can monitor e-mail messages, raised
congressional interest in privacy legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The bills also extend existing law to cover conversations held
on the Internet and other electronic means and make it tougher for
authorities to monitor cell phones or use them to find suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials told a House subcommittee that the
changes would threaten public safety and make it more difficult to
find and prosecute criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not the kind of balanced comprehensive package that
would benefit public safety and privacy,'' Kevin DiGregory, deputy
associate attorney general, said of the bills.
</P>
<P>
   Under existing law, it is relatively simple for a prosecutor to
get the most basic type of telephone tap, a ''pen register'' order
which records only the frequency, source and destination of
telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   To get the tap, a prosecutor goes to a judge, who certifies only
that the information would be relevant to an investigation. But if
a prosecutor then wants to record telephone conversations, then
probable cause must be shown that a crime has occurred or will
occur.
</P>
<P>
   The new legislation would require prosecutors to present that
kind of evidence to obtain a pen register order.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators, upset with the ease with which prosecutors can get
pen register orders, grilled Justice Department officials
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''My constitution wasn't written for the protection of the
prosecutor. For the life of me, I can't see anything in my
constitution that talks about the term 'relevant to an ongoing
criminal investigation,''' said Rep. Mel Watt, D-N.C., ''I think
what you're trying to do is get the Constitution subcommittee to
write a prosecutor standard rather than a Constitution standard.''
</P>
<P>
   DiGregory noted that the Supreme Court has held that the numbers
dialed aren't covered by an expectation of privacy, as opposed to
telephone conversations. He also said the rules would prevent
prosecutors from getting information that would lead to probable
cause.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has a plan to extend the laws to
cover electronic messages, but critics say it contains too many
loopholes that favor law enforcement agencies. Reps Charles Canady,
R-Fla., who chaired the hearing, said his committee would try to
find compromises between the House bills and the administration
initiative in a meeting scheduled for next week.
</P>
<P>
   Civil liberties and privacy groups also attended the hearing,
arguing that while the bills are a good first step, they don't go
far enough to ensure the privacy of citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., attended the hearing to talk about
his bill, which mirrors House legislation designed to force
employers to notify workers if and how they're being monitored in
the office. Legislators said they hope to pass the House and Senate
bills before this Congress ends, and noted that there is little
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate bills require ''clear and conspicuous
notice'' on a yearly basis about an employer's methods of
monitoring -- whether it be via e-mail, telephone, Web browsing or
even watching a worker's keystrokes -- though they don't outlaw any
methods.
</P>
<P>
   ''This legislation provides workers a first line of defense,''
Schumer said, calling the plan ''moderate, reasonable and fair.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bills are H.R. 5018, H.R. 4987, H.R. 4908 and S. 2898.

<HEADLINE> Compromise Reached on Everglades  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A compromise was reached Wednesday that
increases the likelihood of congressional approval this year of a
$1.4 billion first installment for restoration of the imperiled
Florida Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   But lawmakers and environmentalists said concern remains whether
the legislation, likely to be considered by the full Senate in the
coming weeks, can make it through Congress during the hectic rush
toward adjournment.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, still to be considered by the House, authorizes
a sweeping long-term rescue effort for the Everglades that is
expected to cost nearly $8 billion and take as long as four
decades.
</P>
<P>
   The first installment, which calls for spending $1.4 billion,
was approved by the Senate Environment and Natural Resources
Committee in late June, but sugar interests and some of South
Florida's water utilities objected to certain provisions.
</P>
<P>
   After lengthy discussions those concerns -- dealing mainly with
water allocation, maintenance of existing water rights, and the
role of the Interior Department -- were resolved to the satisfaction
of both environmentalists and agriculture and utility interests.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Sens. Connie Mack, a Republican, and Bob Graham, a
Democrat, issued a statement saying the agreement ''dramatically
increases the chance of enacting the legislation into law this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Mack called it ''an historic partnership between many diverse
groups'' that have been on opposite sides on Everglades
restoration.
</P>
<P>
   ''This broad support shows the importance of returning America's
Everglades to the countless endangered species that call this
national treasure home,'' added Graham.
</P>
<P>
   With the changes that were made, Florida's sugar industry and
water utility agencies have joined in support of the legislation,
aides to the two senators said. The bill also has the support of
the White House, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, and major environmental
groups, they added.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have set aside decades of acrimony and are in the same boat
and rowing in the same direction,'' said Stuart Strahl, a vice
president of the National Audubon Society, who heads the group's
Everglades restoration office in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   But Strahl warned that a celebration may be premature.
</P>
<P>
   ''Passing this legislation now becomes a race against the
clock,'' said Strahl.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., chairman of the Environment and Natural
Resources Committee, called passing the legislation his top
environmental priority. His office is now circulating the revised
bill among senators to gauge the support.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida senators hope the bill can come up for a full Senate
vote within two weeks. The House has not yet acted on the measure
and any significant opposition could stall the bill as lawmakers
focus on critical spending bills and then push for adjournment in
the first week of October.
</P>
<P>
   While the Everglades legislation has wide support, some
lawmakers have expressed concern over the amount of federal
spending, and the possibility that costs will increase beyond
current expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ''This project is going to be a giant sucking machine,'' Sen.
John Warner, R-Va., warned when Smith's committee considered the
measure in June.
</P>
<P>
   The plan aims to revamp the water flows within the 100-mile
Everglades system and capture more fresh water and distribute it in
ways to revitalize ecosystem. The project includes eliminating 240
miles of levees and canals, building above-ground reservoirs and
underground aquifers, and developing new wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   The sugar industry and some local water utilities had been
concerned that they would not get enough water, and that their
current water allocation would be in jeopardy. The compromise
resolved those concerns, according to congressional staffers
involved in the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the federal funding of $7.8 billion, the state of
Florida has committed $2 billion over the next 10 years to the
program.

<HEADLINE> Freight train derailment affects morning, evening commutes  </HEADLINE>
By WAYNE PARRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELIZABETH, N.J. (AP) - An early morning freight train derailment
delayed thousands of rail commuters who had to be put on buses and
driven around the accident Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were trying to determine what caused four cars of
a 59-car CSX freight train to go off the tracks in Elizabeth near
the Newark boundary at about 2 a.m., coming to rest on their sides.
</P>
<P>
   Crews had righted three of the four cars as of 11 a.m., and
expected to have the train on its way by late evening.
</P>
<P>
   NJ Transit used shuttle buses to carry passengers around the
crash site. The Elizabeth and North Elizabeth stations were to be
bypassed by NJ Transit trains for most of the day. Trains leaving
New York and Newark were skipping Elizabeth and North Elizabeth and
were to continue to do so through the evening rush hour, spokesman
Michael Klufas said.
</P>
<P>
   Trains headed for Newark or New York from points south were to
resume stopping at Elizabeth and North Elizabeth as of 4:30 p.m.,
he said. Normal service in both directions was to resume at 8:30
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The freight train was headed from Selkirk, N.Y., to Metuchen
with a load of parts for auto assembly plants there and in Linden,
said Robert Lifkind, a spokesman for Conrail, which is jointly
owned by CSX and the Norfolk &AMP; Southern railroads.
</P>
<P>
   ''The train basically serves the auto industry, bringing parts
to the auto assembly plants,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cars 16 through 19 derailed on a fairly straight stretch of
track, Lifkind said. Crews used a rail-mounted crane to lift the
fallen cars in the air and place them back on the rails.
</P>
<P>
   One was a box car carrying auto parts, while the other three
held auto frames, Lifkind said.
</P>
<P>
   By midday, NJ Transit's trains were running on or close to
schedule. Delays averaged about 20 minutes during the morning rush
hour, in which more than 1,500 passengers had to board shuttle
buses.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak passengers fared better, experiencing delays only on two
trains from New York headed to Washington, Cummings said. Train 101
was delayed by five minutes, and train 79 was delayed by nine
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We came through much better than we expected to in terms of
delays,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Labor Council goes to court to block city's new parade regulations  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The Central Labor Council, a group of about 500
labor unions in the city, has gone to court to stop the city from
enforcing new parade rules during the Labor Day Parade next
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules include: no open flame cooking; no food service
from parked vehicles; a maximum height of 12 feet for floats; and
''a zero tolerance policy for alcohol consumption. Violators will
be issued a summons.''
</P>
<P>
   The council says in court papers that the unions will lose
hundreds of thousands of dollars if the city is allowed to enforce
rules that it has sprung on parade organizers and participants at
''the 11th hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Many locals have already paid for food, services and equipment
to accommodate an expected 500,000 people at this year's
festivities, court papers say, with some union locals spending
close to $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Menagh, lawyer for the council, said the city is due in
Manhattan's State Supreme Court on Thursday to explain why it
should not be barred from enforcing the new rules, which were
announced last month.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Corporation Counsel Gabriel Taussig says that the
rules about which the council is complaining are not new.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are enforcing existing law,'' Taussig said. ''There is law
against having an open flame, and we are going to enforce it.
Likewise there is a law against having an open container of alcohol
(at a parade). These are not new rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Taussig confirmed that the city will respond to the council's
court order on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The city announced the rules, including the ban on alcohol sales
at outdoor events, last month mostly because of the dozens of
sexual assaults that followed the Puerto Rican Day Parade on June
11,
</P>
<P>
   Menagh said police officials who met with parade organizers
during the past three months did not say until Aug. 30 that rules
for the Sept. 9 Labor Day Parade would be different.
</P>
<P>
   ''The city's administrative code says that if they change the
rules, they have to give adequate notice to the people who are
affected,'' Menagh said. ''Ten days is not adequate notice.''
</P>
<P>
   Menagh said he and his clients are not concerned about the
alcohol ban but they are worried about the money the unions could
lose.
</P>
<P>
   The parade is to form at 44th Street and continue north on Fifth
Avenue to 72nd Street. About 500 unions are expected to be
represented in the march.

<HEADLINE> GOP Sen.: HUD Playing Politics  </HEADLINE>
By LIB QUAID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal housing officials had no grounds for
bypassing New York agencies in distributing millions of dollars for
homeless people, according to a congressional report ordered by a
GOP senator.
</P>
<P>
   The tussle over homeless funds first arose in the heat of the
New York Senate contest between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, who later abandoned the race. Housing Secretary
Andrew Cuomo, a Clinton supporter, said he yanked the money because
a federal judge ruled the city improperly withheld it from one of
the mayor's critics, a group called Housing Works.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Missouri Sen. Christopher Bond accused the
Department of Housing and Urban Development of deliberately hiding
key information in the lawsuit at the heart of the funding dispute,
and said he is notifying the U.S. attorney and New York Bar
Association of his findings. Bond oversees the subcommittee on HUD
spending.
</P>
<P>
   ''HUD violated the rules of fundamental fairness,'' said Bond,
who issued a 143-page report calling for sanctions and reforms in
the agency. ''Whether the motive was personal or politics or
something else, it is simply wrong, and I intend to make sure HUD
is not distracted again from its core mission of helping Americans
in need.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond's report met with a barrage of protest from three New York
Democratic congressmen as well as HUD and homeless groups involved
in the case. The city's commissioner for the Department of Homeless
Services, Martin Oesterreich, issued this statement: ''The report
speaks for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   HUD fired back that the report was timed to camouflage the
city's recent decisions to fully fund Housing Works, pay $90,000 in
the group's attorney fees and the city's creation of a new
application process for homeless funds.
</P>
<P>
   ''A federal judge said New York City broke the law in giving out
federal funds and was guilty of political retaliation,'' HUD
spokeswoman Lisa MacSpadden said. ''In response, HUD acted
aggressively to protect homeless service providers and we have seen
results.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said HUD had a responsibility to
act: HUD did the right thing for the right reasons and produced the
right result.''
</P>
<P>
   New York Democratic Reps. Major Owens and Gregory Meeks accused
the senator and Giuliani of playing politics rather than admiting
New York City should improve relations with homeless service
providers.
</P>
<P>
   Bond responded: ''This is a fundamental abuse of process. I
don't know anything about New York politics; frankly, I've got all
I can do with Missouri politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles King, executive director of Housing Works, said he had
provided Bond's staff with reams of documentation about the city's
misconduct. But none of it appears in the report, King said, in
particular a preliminary injunction spelling out why the judge
found retaliation from the city.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we had here was a constitutional violation of our first
amendment rights,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   Bond spokesman Ernie Blazar said the senator does not oversee
federal funding for New York; his job is to make sure HUD operates
responsibly, and in that capacity he examines wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The report does detail the August 1999 lawsuit filed by Housing
Works, an outgrowth of the vocal advocacy group ACT-UP. The group
has staged various demonstrations, from City Hall protests to
disrupting city meetings to building and bridge takeovers -- the
latter during rush hour.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Speech Short, Yet Too Long  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- It was one of President Clinton's shortest
speeches ever. And yet it was too long.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is famous for talking at length, reluctant to give up
the microphone as long as anyone is willing to listen. He was
assigned five minutes Wednesday to address the United Nations
Millennium Summit, a gathering of about 160 world leaders.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke for a little more than eight minutes. No one complained
that he went into overtime, perhaps because he called it ''the last
opportunity I will have as president to address this General
Assembly.''

<HEADLINE> Corzine goofs while accepting Sierra Club endorsement  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Democrat Jon Corzine got the coveted
endorsement of the Sierra Club Wednesday in his race for U.S
Senate, but in accepting it committed a freshman mistake at the
microphone that dulled some of the shine.
</P>
<P>
   Promoting himself as an unreserved supporter of all efforts to
save open space, Corzine praised New Jersey's million-acre
preservation program approved by the voters in a November 1998
referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters asked if the Democrat - known for having missed
several elections during his Wall Street days - actually voted on
that one, and he said he had. Staff for Republican candidate Bob
Franks had distributed a news release saying he had not.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is incorrect. I voted in 1998. Check the records,''
Corzine said sharply. ''Every instance in which there is a
referendum on open space or protecting the environment, almost, in
my memory, I have always voted.''
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after the news conference, Corzine aide Tom Shea
called The Associated Press to correct the candidate's memory,
saying he had not voted in 1998 after all. ''He supported the bond
issue, but he didn't make it to vote on that particular day,'' Shea
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Tittel, New Jersey director of the Sierra Club, said
Corzine's error on his record as a voter does not change their
endorsement of him. ''Missing a vote is regrettable, but I don't
think it matters,'' Tittel said. ''When we did the endorsement
process, we were looking toward the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club did, however, look into the past in evaluating
Franks, saying that while the four-term congressman had voted in
support of some environmental initiatives, his overall record was
spotty and mediocre.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club endorsed Franks over Democrat Maryanne Connelly
in his successful 1998 re-election bid in the 7th Congressional
District. Tittel said his track record has slipped since then.
</P>
<P>
   The Franks campaign brushed off the endorsement, saying Franks
had a proven record of leadership on environmental votes and bill
changes to help New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Franks campaign manager Charlie Smith said Corzine's error in
recalling whether he had voted on the 1998 open-space referendum
revealed serious flaws.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is it a small matter? Three times he answered that question,
ultimately untruthfully,'' Smith said. ''The Corzine campaign has
been insisting on very few public appearances possibly for exactly
this reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Corzine said environmental concerns must be at the top of the
political agenda, from clean water to preventing sprawl. ''Without
a clean environment, none of the other things will happen,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   After the Sierra Club endorsement at the Statehouse, Corzine
visited an abandoned factory site in a depressed area of the city.
He called for more upfront funding from federal agencies to assess
such sites more quickly for cleanup and new development.
</P>
<P>
   The site of the former Magic Marker plant he visited has been
untouched for 11 years because testing to assess cleanup needs has
not been completed, local officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine pledged to support the federal Clean Water Act when it
comes up for renewal next year. Tittel said the Sierra Club was
scornful of Franks' votes on the same measure in 1994. The
Republican-sponsored version Franks had voted for was opposed by
environmental groups as a trick to weaken water-treatment rules,
and it was ultimately scuttled by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Smith acknowledged the 1994 vote by Franks went against the
grain of groups like the Sierra Club. But he said Franks had played
a key role with many votes and amendments to strengthen laws
controlling the quality of water in rivers, the ocean and the
household tap.

<HEADLINE> Grim E-mail From W. Timor in Attack  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID CRARY
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Six hours before he and two colleagues
were murdered in West Timor, an American relief worker e-mailed a
friend at a U.N. security office with a warning that a mob was en
route to destroy his compound. ''We sit here like bait, unarmed,''
he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The message was sent by Carlos Caceres of Puerto Rico, one of
three employees of the U.N. refugee agency who were mutilated and
burned in Wednesday's onslaught by a mob of militiamen opposed to
independence for East Timor. West Timor remains under Indonesian
rule.
</P>
<P>
   ''These guys act without thinking and can kill a human being as
easily (and painlessly) as I kill mosquitos in my room,'' Caceres
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials said Caceres sent the message to a friend at a
security office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in
Skopje, Macedonia, which was assigned to help coordinate safety
measures for the faraway UNHCR workers in the West Timor town of
Atambua.
</P>
<P>
   A Security Council statement said the UNHCR had received advance
warning of possible trouble and was assured by the Indonesian
security forces that agency staff would be protected.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was in the office when the news came out that a wave of
violence would soon pound Atambua,'' wrote Caceres. ''We sent most
of the staff home. I just heard someone on the radio saying that
they are praying for us...''
</P>
<P>
   ''You should see this office,'' Caceres continued. ''Plywood on
the windows, staff peering out through the openings in the curtains
hastily installed a few minutes ago. We are waiting for the
enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Caceres added that he was due to start a three-week trip on
Thursday - ''I just hope I will be able to leave tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his fears, Caceres told his friend in Skopje he would
keep working.
</P>
<P>
   ''As wait for the militia to do their business, I will draft the
agenda for tomorrow's meeting...,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   According to information provided to the Security Council,
militiamen armed with homemade and semiautomatic weapons overran
the UNHCR compound in Atambua, chasing away nine local policemen on
guard.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most UNHCR staff fled over a rear wall,'' a U.N. statement
said. ''However, three of them were apparently unable to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Robin Groves, a spokeswoman for the UNHCR, said Caceres, 33,
attended the University of Florida and later received a law degree
from Cornell. He had worked with the UNHCR since 1987. Groves did
not know his home town in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council discussed the attack in an urgent session
Wednesday afternoon, then issued a statement expressing condolences
and condemning ''this outrageous and contemptible act.''
</P>
<P>
   ''As a result, the essential international assistance to an
estimated 100,000 East Timorese refugees has been suspended,
putting that vulnerable population at risk,'' the council statement
said.
</P>
<P>
   The council urged Indonesia to end militia violence, ensure
security at refugee camps and work with international agencies to
ensure that refugees can return home.
</P>
<P>
   Groves said Caceres' e-mail was read aloud to the Security
Council by Sadako Ogata, the UNHCR's head.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were all profoundly moved,'' Groves said. ''You could see
the reaction was very intense.''

<HEADLINE> State Officials: No sign of West Nile virus in humans  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Investigations into the illnesses of 39
people across Connecticut have shown no link to the West Nile
virus, state health officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Public Health has looked into 25 human cases
of encephalitis, 15 cases of aseptic meningitis and one case of
fever, in an effort to determine if the West Nile virus was
responsible. Test results in 37 of those cases showed no sign of
the virus. Officials were still awaiting results in two cases
Wednesday
</P>
<P>
   Eight human cases of West Nile virus have been reported in New
York this year.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, 223 birds - the vast majority of which were
crows - have tested positive for the virus in 35 communities.
Southington and Middletown were added to that list Wednesday . The
virus also has been found in three pools of bird-biting mosquitoes
in Stamford and Norwalk.
</P>
<P>
   The virus is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes and can
sometimes lead to a deadly swelling of the brain.

<HEADLINE> Redskins Defense Paying Dividends  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- In the aftermath of Washington's 20-17
victory over Carolina on Sunday, it's not clear whether owner Dan
Snyder's spending spree created a Super Bowl-caliber team.
</P>
<P>
   The following is certain: the defense is greatly improved.
</P>
<P>
   The unit, ranked 27th overall in 1999, shot up to No. 8 after
yielding 236 yards to Carolina's potent offense, which averaged 355
last season. The Panthers' passing game -- rated second in the NFL
in 1999 -- gained only 124 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Why the impressive upgrade?
</P>
<P>
   The defense is much more intense. An attack-style approach shut
down the Panthers in the second half and helped record six sacks
overall. At that pace, the Redskins would finish with a
league-record 96 sacks.
</P>
<P>
   New defensive coordinator Ray Rhodes is credited with instilling
more aggressiveness in his players. His predecessor, Mike Nolan,
used an otherwise passive game plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Seemed like every play we were coming after the offense, and
we weren't reacting to what they were going to do,'' defensive end
Ndukwe Kalu said. ''We set the tone and let them react to us. Just
from reading the papers last season, a lot of guys were complaining
that our defense wasn't aggressive enough. No way we can complain
about that this year.''
</P>
<P>
   A major reason for that is Bruce Smith, one of Snyder's marquee
acquisitions. The NFL's No. 2 career sack leader terrorized
Carolina's linemen, particularly left tackle Clarence Jones, and
had 1&AMP;frac12; sacks. He drew double teams, giving left end Marco Coleman
(2&AMP;frac12; sacks) a wide path to quarterback Steve Berlin. Linebackers
Derek Smith and Kevin Mitchell each had a sack.
</P>
<P>
   ''Having Bruce Smith on the other side sure helps,'' Coleman
said. ''Seems like the whole offensive line is on him. I'm going to
do everything I can to take advantage of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The ferocity of another high-priced newcomer, safety Mark
Carrier, was evident late in the second quarter. With the Panthers
driving for a touchdown to put them up by 10 points, Carrier broke
up a pass around the 10-yard line with a jarring hit on tight end
Wesley Walls, who remained sprawled on the field for several
minutes. Two plays later, Carolina's Richie Cunningham missed a
27-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Deion Sanders, who was quiet Sunday, is another huge
defensive asset.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just have guys on defense who have the potential to make
big plays,'' Coleman said. ''When you add guys like Deion Sanders,
Mark Carrier, Bruce Smith, every play you're looking to see who's
going to make that big play. That's the biggest attribute.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense showed a weakness in the first half. Carolina
running back Tim Biakabutuka ran through some gaping holes for 66
yards. He once gained 41 yards after maneuvering around the right
end. But the defense clamped down in the second half, when he
tallied only 22 yards.

<P>
   This Sunday, the Redskins will be on the road facing a Detroit
offense that produced only 187 yards and six points in a 14-10
victory over New Orleans. Stoney Case, substituting for the injured
Charlie Batch, was 13-of-25 for 100 yards. But Batch, who led the
Lions to a 6-2 record by the midpoint of last season, is almost
healthy enough to return as the starter, according to Lions coach
Bobby Ross.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit also is coming off a 33-17 victory over the Redskins
last year in the Silverdome, and Kalu knows the Redskins' defense
can't take the Lions lightly.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't let such a good game (against Carolina) get to our
head because we all know what happened last year against Detroit,''
he said. ''So it's going to be a big test for us.''

<HEADLINE> Love Re-Signs With Titleist  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG FERGUSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKVILLE, Ontario (AP) -- Davis Love III turned down an offer
from Nike Golf to play a ball similar to the one used by Tiger
Woods, agreeing Wednesday to a multiyear contract extension with
Acushnet Co. to stick with Titleist.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our entire company is ecstatic that Davis will remain part of
the Acushnet Co. family for many years to come,'' chairman and CEO
Wally Uihlein said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to disclose terms of the deal, only that Love will
continue playing Titleist clubs and balls, and wear gloves and
shoes by FootJoy, another Acushnet brand.
</P>
<P>
   ''When someone is throwing piles of money at you, you've got to
take a look,'' Love said after his pro-am round at the Canadian
Open. ''It was awfully tempting. We're talking a lot of money --
more than what you're used to. In the end, I wanted to be with
Titleist.''
</P>
<P>
   The contract extension comes at an important time for Titleist,
which lost Woods to Nike and Colin Montgomerie to Callaway Golf in
a golf ball battle that continues to heat up.
</P>
<P>
   ''The game is on,'' Uihlein told Golf World Business. ''As far
as we're concerned, we're at war, and Love was our Midway. Anybody
who thinks we're lying and dying, I've got news for them. We're
beefing up, we're not backing off.''
</P>
<P>
   And Titleist appears to be rearming.
</P>
<P>
   Love first tried the Nike Tour Accuracy, a brand used by Woods
and Notah Begay, before the British Open and liked the ball well
enough to consider leaving Titleist. What persuaded him to stay
with Titleist was a new three-piece ball expected to be released
later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Love also got a new set of irons -- 990bs -- which are in his bag
this week.
</P>
<P>
   One industry source, speaking on condition of anonymity, also
said Phil Mickelson considered shopping around for a new product
until he tried a prototype of the new Titleist ball, which is
expected to be on the U.S. Golf Association's next approval list.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's so good, it's a joke,'' Love said. ''I called Wally after
the NEC and said, 'I want to hit the new ball, and if it's it what
I want, we'll talk.' As soon as I hit it, I called Wally and said,
'What are we going to do?'''
</P>
<P>
   Titleist recently re-signed Ernie Els and Masters champion Vijay
Singh. It also has deals with David Duval, Lee Westwood, Darren
Clarke and Sergio Garcia, and is trying to keep Jesper Parnevik in
its camp.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't want to lose him (Love),'' Uihlein told the
magazine. ''We take very seriously any threat to our franchise and
any attempt to derail our position in the marketplace.''

<HEADLINE> Wrestler Stays on U.S. Olympic Team  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rejecting an emergency request by the U.S.
Olympic Committee, a Supreme Court justice refused to keep
Greco-Roman wrestler Matt Lindland off the American team, soon to
leave for the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   Justice John Paul Stevens, acting without comment Wednesday,
left intact court rulings that forced the USOC to reinstate
Lindland. Committee members sought to keep Keith Sieracki on the
team instead.
</P>
<P>
   Lindland, a former University of Nebraska wrestling coach,
dropped a 2-1 referee's decision to Sieracki, a military police
sergeant, at the Olympic trials in Dallas on June 23. But Lindland
contended he was illegally tripped by Sieracki and took the case to
arbitration. The arbitrator ordered a rematch, in which Lindland
defeated Sieracki, 8-0.
</P>
<P>
   When the USOC balked at making a roster change, Lindland asked a
federal trial judge to declare his right to join the U.S. team.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge James B. Zagel in Chicago ordered the
committee to contact the International Olympic Committee and tell
it to change the U.S. roster so Lindland could participate as its
167&AMP;frac12;-pound member.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel of the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
upheld the judge's order last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sieracki took things into his own hands. He has
called the USOC's attention to a videotape of the 2-1 match that
appears to show Lindland biting him on the ear.
</P>
<P>
   Though not conclusive, the tape shows Lindland making a
deliberate move toward Sieracki's right ear as the two wrestlers
jostle for leverage. Sieracki immediately jumps back in protest,
and close-up footage showed a small amount of blood coming from the
ear.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Lindland denied biting Sieracki's ear.
</P>
<P>
   ''I absolutely didn't bite anybody,'' Lindland said in a phone
interview as he signed autographs at a Vancouver, Wash. car lot
which is sponsoring him. ''If you watch the match, you can see why
I protested. We focused on the trip, because that was so clear and
so obvious. If you watch the whole match, it's very clear that was
officiated wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindland moved with his family to Milwaukie, Ore., on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''For them to say I won this in the courts is ludicrous. I more
than won this on the mat,'' he said. ''I feel bad that we had to go
to court to enforce (the USOC's) own policies and procedures,
because we did everything right.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm really happy to be on the Olympic team, but my goal is to
get a medal, not just be on the team. I'm prepared. I've been
planning on going no matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   In seeking help from Stevens, who handles emergency matters from
Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin for the nation's highest court,
lawyers for the USOC said the case ''presents the question of who
is empowered to choose the athlete who will represent the United
States ... the United States Olympic Committee or the (7th) U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Lindland said the emergency request should be
rejected. They accused the USOC of ignoring its own rules for
selecting team members.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. wrestling team is scheduled to leave for Australia on
Friday. The Olympics will begin Sept. 15.

<HEADLINE> Saints' Williams Questionable  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- New Orleans running back Ricky Williams was a
surprise addition to the team's injury list on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Williams woke up with a swollen right foot Monday morning and it
was placed in a walking cast. He doesn't remember injuring it but
it was swollen and he was hobbled by it Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He could barely walk,'' coach Jim Haslett said Wednesday. ''We
planned to hold him out of practice, but I looked up and he was in
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he had planned to work the entire practice
Wednesday. When the team ran sprints at the end of practice, he
rode an exercise bike for about 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   X-rays were negative and he was diagnosed with a bruised foot.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was listed as questionable on the injury report for
Sunday's game at San Diego, but Haslett said unless the foot reacts
badly to the work Wednesday, he'll be upgraded to probable
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I'm practicing on Wednesday, then everything should be fine
on Sunday,'' Williams said.

<HEADLINE> Castro addresses United Nations on rights of Third World  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) - President Fidel Castro spoke out
forcefully for the Third World before kings and presidents
Wednesday, accusing three dozen wealthy nations of monopolizing
power at the expense of poorer nations.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the U.N. Millennium Summit, the Cuban leader decried
the poverty that he says afflicts 80 percent of the world's 6
billion people and accused rich nations - especially the United
States - of using their power ''to make us poorer, more exploited
and more dependent.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban leader, famed for speeches that have run for eight
hours or longer, drew a huge round of laughter from fellow leaders
when he stepped to the podium, took out a white handkerchief, and
covered the light which warns speakers that they are approaching
the five-minute time limit. He stuck to the time limit, and the
leaders laughed as he took the handkerchief off the light before he
left the podium.
</P>
<P>
   But he was more serious during his address, saying that
inequalities in wealth around the globe were at the heart of the
world's conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Current underdevelopment and poverty have resulted from
conquest, colonization, slavery and plundering in most countries of
the planet by the colonial powers,'' Castro said. He said that
wealthy nations were morally obligated to ''compensate our nations
for the damages caused throughout centuries.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban leader also complained that a radical reform of the
United Nations to make it more democratic is not being discussed,
noting that when the world body was formed more than a half century
ago there were few independent nations.
</P>
<P>
   He attacked the current U.N. system in which the five veto
wielding members of the Security Council - the United States,
Russia, China, Britain and France - have overwhelming power while
the rest of the 189 U.N. member states have little.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. system envisioned by Castro would take away the vetoes
and make the 189-member General Assembly pre-eminent in running
U.N. affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Castro arrived Tuesday for his first visit to the United States
in five years to attend this week's three-day gathering of world
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the afternoon, Castro met with President Abdoulaye
Wade of Senegal and President Tran Duc Luong of Vietnam. The Cuban
president was meeting later in the day with his friend and
political ally Hugo Chavez, the Venezuelan president.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after his arrival early Tuesday afternoon, he met
separately with Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and
Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   During Castro's speech, about 100 anti-communist black-clad
protesters were gathered near the Cuban mission in midtown
Manhattan where he is staying. Many Cuban-American exiles resent
his presence in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was obliged to grant Castro a visa under a
1947 U.N. rule that requires the host country to grant visas to
officials attending U.N. meetings. Castro last spoke in New York at
the 50th anniversary of the United Nations in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Land Mine Ban Making a Difference  </HEADLINE>
By GEIR MOULSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- A global treaty to ban the use of land mines has
made a significant difference in its first 18 months, but major
blackspots -- among them Chechnya, Kosovo and Myanmar -- remain,
anti-mine campaigners said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Angola continues to use the weapons although it has signed the
treaty, while Burundi and Sudan ''likely'' do so, according to the
Landmine Monitor 2000 report. Sudan has denied the allegation.
</P>
<P>
   The study said Yugoslav forces laid some 50,000 land mines
during the Kosovo conflict and that Chechnya also saw heavy laying
of mines.
</P>
<P>
   The report, produced by the Nobel laureate International
Campaign to Ban Landmines, will be presented next week to a Geneva
meeting of countries that have ratified a 1997 treaty outlawing the
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have turned the tide in the battle against mines,'' the
1,121-page report said. It found that trade in the weapons has
almost completely halted, with no shipments recorded this year or
last.
</P>
<P>
   Since the treaty came into force on March 1 last year, some 10
million stockpiled antipersonnel mines have been destroyed,
bringing the total so far to 22 million, it said.
</P>
<P>
   The study estimated that more than 250 million mines remain
stockpiled in 105 nations.
</P>
<P>
   China leads the list with some 110 million mines, followed by
Russia with 60-70 million, Belarus with 10-15 million and the
United States with 11 million, it said. Ukraine, Pakistan and India
each were estimated to have stocks of more than 4 million mines.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of deaths and injuries were ''sketchy and
incomplete,'' the study conceded. But it found marked decreases in
countries including Afghanistan, Bosnia, Cambodia and Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
   Still, new land mine victims have been recorded in 71 countries,
more than half of them at peace, it said. In Kosovo, 492 deaths and
injuries were recorded in the year to May; in Chechnya,
''hundreds'' were suspected.
</P>
<P>
   Since the treaty came into effect the weapons likely have been
used in 20 conflicts, by 11 governments and 30 rebel groups.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty has been signed by 138 governments and ratified by
101. Among those who have not signed are the United States, Russia
and China.
</P>
<P>
   Washington maintains land mines are needed on the Korean
peninsula to deter North Korea from invading South Korea. President
Clinton wants the United States to approve the treaty by 2006, but
only if the armed forces are able to come up with an alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and China say they need land mines for defensive
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Antipersonnel mines have been used in eight conflicts in Africa
over the past year, more than any other continent, Landmine Monitor
said. They killed or maimed more than 1,000 people in Angola.
</P>
<P>
   The report said Colombia, where the two biggest rebel factions
have used land mines, is the only country in the Americas where
they are now being used.
</P>
<P>
   In Asia, mines were used in at least six conflicts over the past
year -- among them in Kashmir and the Philippines where, the study
said, three rebel groups have used mines or improvised explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Government forces and at least 10 armed ethnic groups in Myanmar
laid mines ''in significant numbers'' -- resulting in 1,500 mine
victims last year -- while both sides used them in Sri Lanka's civil
war, it added.

<HEADLINE> FDA Warns on Laetrile Resurgence  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal health officials warned Internet users
Wednesday to beware of a concoction made of apricot seeds that's
touted as a cancer cure, as a Florida court case became the
government's latest attempt to quell a resurgence of laetrile.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, thousands of patients went to Mexico seeking
laetrile, and some doctors sold it here, before a National Cancer
Institute study concluded the substance did not fight cancer.
Experts also warned that laetrile pills could cause cyanide
poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   So the Food and Drug Administration declared laetrile illegal.
Several states fought the FDA action but courts backed the
government, ending laetrile's heyday by 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Now laetrile is rebounding on the Internet, sometimes sold under
the aliases amygdalin or ''vitamin B17.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the FDA announced that a U.S. District judge in Miami
had issued a preliminary injunction halting sales by three Internet
sites, and warned consumers to beware.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not want people to take products that have not been
proven to be safe and effective,'' said FDA enforcement chief John
Taylor, saying the biggest worry is that patients will forego
proven cancer therapy.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's ruling temporarily stops laetrile sales by World
Without Cancer Inc. and Health World International Inc., of Bay
Harbor Fla., and Arizona-based Health Genesis Corp., which also
does business in Bay Harbor Island, while the court considers an
FDA lawsuit seeking to permanently halt the sales. The FDA said
since 1998 its inspectors have warned David E. Arjona, a official
of all three companies, that laetrile is illegal, yet those
inspectors bought laetrile from his Web site in June.
</P>
<P>
   Arjona did not return a phone call. His attorney, Kirkpatrick
Dilling of Chicago, was not aware of the preliminary injunction but
said his client ''hasn't sold one thing that's harmful to
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The Florida case is the FDA's third laetrile crackdown this
year, part of the agency's new attempt to block Internet sales of
unapproved drugs. In April, a federal judge ordered a New York
company to stop selling laetrile; in July, a federal grand jury
indicted an Ohio laetrile seller.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer will submit bill to Albany for McKenna's defense  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - One of two police officer found innocent of
beating a College of Saint Rose basketball in a police garage was
cleared of departmental charges Wednesday, allowing him to return
to the beat after some three years on paid leave.
</P>
<P>
   The case stemmed from an October 1997 bar brawl between then
21-year-old Jermaine Henderson and the officers, who were off duty
at the time. Henderson was arrested after the fight and taken back
to the police garage where he said he was assaulted while
handcuffed.
</P>
<P>
   The case was closely watched by the Albany chapter of the Albany
chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People, which says black youth frequently report being roughed up
by city police.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution was dealt a setback when Henderson refused to
testify in court, citing his Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination. Prior to the trial, Henderson agreed to settle
his civil rights lawsuit against the city for $60,000.
</P>
<P>
   A jury cleared 0fficers William Bonnani and Sean McKenna in
March of 1999, saying there wasn't enough evidence to convict.
</P>
<P>
   The arbitration hearing was the final step in clearing Bonnani.
A decision on McKenna is still pending.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, of Sharon, Mass., is the son of former NBA guard
Gerald Henderson, who played for the New York Knicks and Boston
Celtics during his 13-year career.

<HEADLINE> Williams Brings Force to Bills  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN WAWROW
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- Pat Williams has surprised everyone in
the NFL. Everyone, that is, except for the Buffalo Bills.
</P>
<P>
   Signed as an undrafted free agent for the NFL minimum salary in
1997, the defensive tackle Williams is emerging as a force in the
Bills' new-look scheme. Lining up alongside fellow heavyweight nose
tackle Ted Washington, the two 310-plus-pounders provide an
effective and -- after one game -- unstoppable one-two punch.
</P>
<P>
   ''It worked good. Not anybody can stop me or Ted,'' Williams
said after practice Wednesday. ''(Washington) softens then up for
me, and then I go out and punish them a little more.
</P>
<P>
   ''So Ted punishes them, I punish them, and they be done.''
</P>
<P>
   That pretty much sums up what happened to the Tennessee Titans
in the Bills' season-opening 16-13 victory Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Facing Titans star back Eddie George, the Bills added a wrinkle
to their defense by inserting Williams alongside Washington and
veteran end Phil Hansen on first-down plays.
</P>
<P>
   The help limit George -- the NFL's leading rusher over the past
three years -- to a mere 37 yards. In all, the two combined for 10
tackles and a sack.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Titans center Kevin Long, who took much of the
brunt, Williams said: ''We pounded on him that he didn't want to
play no more. You could see it in his eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for the concerns on how the Bills will replace defensive
end Bruce Smith.
</P>
<P>
   And so much for the teams that passed on Williams, a Texas A&AMP;M
product, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a great story,'' Bills coach Wade Phillips said. ''He was
a good player in college, good athlete, had some potential but
didn't get drafted. We signed him. We liked him. I think he's an
outstanding player right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Realizing how good he was, the Bills restructured Williams'
contract last March, extending it into a five-year $8.7 million
deal, plus a $3.8 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   The new scheme works simply. Williams, Washington's backup last
year, lines up just off center. Washington faces the weak-side
guard. Hansen moves to the strong side, while outside linebacker
Sam Rogers plays just off the line as a pass rusher.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Washington attracts the double team, allowing
Williams and Rogers room to penetrate.
</P>
<P>
   ''We worked on it in training camp,'' Bills defensive
coordinator Ted Cottrell said. ''Luckily, no one saw it. And then
we popped it on Tennessee. I guess it surprised them a little
bit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Green Bay Packers, who visit Buffalo on Sunday, won't be as
surprised. But it still won't be easy to deal with, said Packers
coach Mike Sherman.
</P>
<P>
   ''You put those 300-plus-pounders inside right there ... they
pretty much shut everything down,'' Sherman said. ''That was great
on their part and boded well for their defense.''

<HEADLINE> Elections regulators reject professor's complaint  </HEADLINE>
By RICH HARRIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Sen. Joseph Lieberman can run for both
the vice presidency and re-election to the Senate, the state
Elections Enforcement Commission confirmed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's general counsel, Jeffrey Garfield, rejected the
complaint of a politics professor who said Lieberman's re-election
campaign was ''frivolous'' and ''irresponsibly self-indulgent'' and
urged that he be eliminated from the Senate ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman had already announced his intention to run for
re-election when Al Gore selected him to be his running mate. If
elected to both offices, Lieberman would have to resign from the
Senate to serve as vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Garfield said a 1964 written opinion by the attorney general
found that state election laws permitted such a dual candidacy.
That opinion was written when then-Sen. Thomas Dodd, who was
running for re-election, was under consideration for the Democratic
vice presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing in that regard has changed since 1964,'' Garfield
said.
</P>
<P>
   Garfield said he had informed Fairfield University Professor
John Orman of his decision. Orman had argued that the commission
had a legal duty to prevent ''frivolous'' candidates from appearing
on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Orman had also argued that Lieberman's Senate campaign
benefitted unfairly from expenditures on his vice presidential
campaign. If so, the state commission said, that would be a matter
for federal regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Orman said Wednesday the 1964 decision was an effort by three
cohorts of former Democratic National Chairman John M. Bailey to
''clear the decks'' for Dodd to get the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here we are 36 years later. We don't operate under the Bailey
machine rules,'' Orman said.
</P>
<P>
   Orman said he would wait to see the formal response from the
elections commission and Secretary of the State Susan Bysiewicz
before deciding whether to pursue the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the Senate race Wednesday, Lieberman said, ''The
U.S. Senate seat is too important to fill on the run. I am going to
stay on the ballot.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides its effect on presidential politics, Lieberman's Senate
race has implications for the balance of power in Congress. If
Lieberman were elected to both jobs and resigned from the Senate,
it would fall to Republican Gov. John G. Rowland to appoint a
replacement who would serve until the next statewide election in
2002. Rowland has said he will appoint a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, who has a large lead over Republican Philip Giordano
in recent polls, could drop out of the Senate race as late as Oct.
27 and still be replaced by a Democratic Party nominee.

<HEADLINE> White Sox Eldred Hasn't Decided  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Despite a stress fracture in his pitching arm,
Cal Eldred isn't ready to say his season is over.
</P>
<P>
   Tests showed the Chicago White Sox right-hander has a stress
fracture just below his right elbow. He said Wednesday he wants to
consult with doctors some more before deciding what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't really tell you what we're going to do,'' he said.
''There's nothing really final. We're waiting to see what our
options are and we'll go from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Eldred plans to meet with doctors Thursday, and general manager
Ron Schueler said he hopes to announce a decision before Thursday
night's game. While Schueler said it's possible Eldred could pitch
again this year, he wasn't exactly optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to rule it out yet,'' Schueler said. ''I'd be
thrilled if he did come back. But I'm not going to count on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Eldred has been on the disabled list since July 17 because of
nerve problems in his right elbow. It's the sixth trip to the DL in
five years for Eldred, who had ligament replacement surgery in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   His rehabilitation was going well -- so well, in fact, that
manager Jerry Manuel hoped he'd pitch this Friday against
Cleveland. But during his second rehab start Sunday at Triple-A
Charlotte, the pain returned and Eldred pulled himself out after
two innings.
</P>
<P>
   He went through a battery of tests Tuesday, and results showed
the stress fracture. The fracture isn't related to the nerve
problems. Eldred said he had a similar injury in 1998 and showed
symptoms of another one last year.
</P>
<P>
   The fractures eventually heal, but it takes time. With the
playoffs beginning in about three weeks, that's something neither
Eldred nor the White Sox have.
</P>
<P>
   ''To lose a guy like that our of your rotation, at this time of
year, it's difficult to overcome,'' Manuel said. ''He means a lot
more to us than just a guy that came out of spring training as a
fifth starter. He not only became one of the horses, he emerged as
one of the clubhouse leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Eldred showed the same form early on that he had when he was the
Milwaukee Brewers' ace from 1992-94. He went 10-2, throwing two
complete games and a shutout. He was the AL Player of the Month in
June.
</P>
<P>
   His performance was one of the keys in Chicago's fast start, and
the White Sox have struggled without him.
</P>
<P>
   ''It hasn't been easy the last month and a half,'' Eldred said.
''I feel bad. I feel, in a way, that I've let the team down.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing hasn't exactly been good from a personal standpoint,
either. Eldred is a free agent after this season, and he hasn't
talked to the White Sox about next year.
</P>
<P>
   Schueler said last month he wasn't going to negotiate with
anyone until after the season to avoid distractions.
</P>
<P>
   ''When there's no one there to pay the bills next year, that's
not very attractive,'' said Eldred, 32. ''But it's part of the game
and you have to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   And Eldred does plan to be back next season. Asked if the latest
injury made him wonder if it was time to retire, a horrified look
crossed his face.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't say that,'' he said. ''When I'm healthy, I think this
year proved I can pitch. And that's a whole lot of fun.''

<HEADLINE> Broncos' Gary Stunned by Injury  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MOSSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Olandis Gary has listened to the doctors and seen
the X-rays. He still can't quite believe it.
</P>
<P>
   Despite feeling something ''give'' in his right knee during the
third quarter of Monday night's 41-36 loss to St. Louis, the Denver
Broncos running back continued to play, and even ripped off gains
of 25 and 13 yards in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Because of looseness in the joint, Gary underwent an MRI exam
that was termed precautionary on Tuesday morning. The results,
however, stunned him and his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   He had completely torn the anterior cruciate ligament in his
knee and will require season-ending reconstructive surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was shocking because even after the game, I didn't have any
ill effects with my knee,'' Gary said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought it was just going to be a precautionary thing with
the MRI, and then coming in and them telling me I tore my ACL. ...
It was a terrible thing, a tough pill to swallow. It's still kind
of tough to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary, whose 1,159 yards rushing last season in relief of the
injured Terrell Davis figured to make him a valuable backup to
Davis this season, walked without a limp Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like I told coach, I still feel like I can play and give
Atlanta all they want this weekend,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gary believes he was injured while pass blocking, but didn't
think it was serious.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really didn't,'' he said. ''I came out for a second and the
docs looked at it. They gave me a little test and I ran around a
little bit and passed the test. Then I went back out there in the
third and continued to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary, assuming the rushing duties after Davis sprained his left
ankle, led the team with 80 yards on 13 carries.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested he could have damaged the knee earlier, perhaps in
a preseason game.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had had problems with it before that,'' he said, ''but it
was stable. They kept giving me the tests, and it was stable.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Davis, who had reconstructive knee surgery last October,
has been helpful in preparing him for the surgery and
rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tried to let him know what to expect as far as rehab time,''
Davis said. ''You're going to have situations where you get pretty
down about it because you're not going to see any improvement or
any progress in your rehab. I think the thing you have to maintain
is your excitement level and the belief that you can come back from
the injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis also said Gary probably is in ''a state of denial. You
don't want to believe it is happening. I've been there.''
</P>
<P>
   As if to prove it, Gary said he is seeking a second medical
opinion from a specialist in California.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just to make sure,'' Gary said. ''It's 99 percent, but it's
that 1 percent. We'll just see what they say, and we pretty much
know what they're going to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Mike Shanahan said the Broncos encourage any player to
seek a second opinion. But he added, ''When four radiologists look
at it (MRI) and they say it's a tear and the doctors look at it and
they say it's a tear... Believe me, I asked 15 times, 'Are you sure
it's a tear?' Usually they go the other direction and say, 'Let's
look at it one more time.' But, unfortunately, those MRIs don't lie
very often.''

<HEADLINE> Giants Offense Faces Test Vs Eagles  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The New York Giants' offensive line
had an impressive debut against Arizona, opening holes for Tiki
Barber and Ron Dayne and not letting anyone lay a hand on
quarterback Kerry Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Now the linemen need to do it against Philadelphia's
blitz-happy, aggressive defense, which sent Troy Aikman to the
hospital in the Eagles' season-opening 41-14 win over the Dallas
Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia held the Cowboys to 167 total yards, limiting
Emmitt Smith to 29 yards on seven carries. Aikman suffered the
ninth concussion of his 12-year career in a game where he was
sacked four times in just over a quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ''They dominated the line of scrimmage down there,'' Giants left
guard Glenn Parker said. ''That set the whole tone for the entire
game. So that's our challenge. We have to establish something, take
at least half the line of scrimmage and get our guys running.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' offensive line did more than that in the season
opener against the undermanned Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Barber rushed for 144 yards and two touchdowns, Dayne added 78
yards and a TD, and Collins wasn't sacked in hitting 17 of 25
passes for 172 yards in a 21-16 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't care if you are playing the greatest team in the world
or the worst, you have to have your assignments right and we did
that,'' Parker said. ''That gives us confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The offensive line was revamped in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   The only player in the same spot as last year is right guard Ron
Stone.
</P>
<P>
   Right tackle Luke Petitgout was a failure at left guard as a
rookie, but the 1999 first-round draft pick has played well at
tackle. Parker, left tackle Lomas Brown and center Dusty Zeigler
were all signed as free agents in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Zeigler said one of the things that got the line going was
getting to know one another off the field.
</P>
<P>
   ''When practice was over we got together and blended
personalities,'' Zeigler said. ''It made everyone more comfortable
with one another. It probably broke the ice. Once you know what
kind of person they are, you expect certain things from them on the
football field.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Giants also know what to expect from the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks like the Eagles are back to some smash-mouth
defense,'' Barber said. ''We watched that tape and they are pretty
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only do the Eagles have a good front four, they have three
very athletic linebackers, two outstanding corners in Troy Vincent
and Bobby Taylor, and a big hitter at safety in Brian Dawkins.
</P>
<P>
   Barber thinks the Giants' offense will do well against the
Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not surprised by our success,'' he said. ''We put in a
month and a half of work after our minicamp where we all hunkered
down and learned this thing. It is paying off for us.''

<HEADLINE> Flyers Met With LeClair  </HEADLINE>
By DAN ROBRISH
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- John LeClair, the Philadelphia forward who
won the largest arbitration award in NHL history, met with team
officials Wednesday to discuss a long-term deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the meeting was amicable but unproductive,'' Flyers
general manager Bob Clarke said after the two-hour meeting.
</P>
<P>
   LeClair got a one-year deal for $7 million because of the
arbitrator's decision in August; he was seeking $9 million and the
team had offered $4.6 million. The one-year contract allows the
former 50-goal scorer to become an unrestricted free agent July 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's always been our hope to try and get John signed to a
long-term deal,'' Clarke said. He said he planned to speak to
LeClair's agent, Lewis S. Gross, by phone on Friday. LeClair has
set a deadline of Sept. 10 for working out a trade; that is also
the first day of the Flyers' on-ice training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke said he is not sure what the team will do if it cannot
work out a deal with LeClair.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have any planned course of action; trading John is
one of the options,'' Clarke said. ''In the meantime, we're just
going to get prepared for the season and John will be part of the
Flyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Gross did not immediately return a phone message left after
business hours Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   LeClair had 40 goals and 37 assists in 82 games last season.

	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - Fans waiting for the new date for pop star
Christina Aguilera's New York State Fair appearance were dealt a
blow Wednesday, when booking agencies said they were unable to find
anything workable.
</P>
<P>
   The Sept. 3 concert was called off due to laryngitis. Nearly

   ''We deeply regret that a rescheduled show couldn't be fit into
her remaining east coast schedule,'' Ron Baird of the booking
agency Creative Artists Agency said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Fair spokesman Joe LaGuardia said all tickets would be refunded
at purchase points.

<HEADLINE> Complaint Against Lieberman Out  </HEADLINE>
By RICH HARRIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Sen. Joseph Lieberman can run for both
the vice presidency and re-election to the Senate, the state
Elections Enforcement Commission confirmed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's general counsel, Jeffrey Garfield, rejected the
complaint of a politics professor who said Lieberman's re-election
campaign was ''frivolous'' and ''irresponsibly self-indulgent'' and
urged that he be eliminated from the Senate ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman had already announced his intention to run for
re-election when Al Gore selected him to be his running mate. If
elected to both offices, Lieberman would have to resign from the
Senate to serve as vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Garfield said a 1964 written opinion by the attorney general
found that state election laws permitted such a dual candidacy.
That opinion was written when then-Sen. Thomas Dodd, who was
running for re-election, was under consideration for the Democratic
vice presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Garfield said he had informed Fairfield University Professor
John Orman of his decision.
</P>
<P>
   Orman had argued that the commission had a legal duty to keep
''frivolous'' candidates off the ballot. Orman said Wednesday he
was deciding whether to press his case further.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the Senate race Wednesday, Lieberman said, ''The
U.S. Senate seat is too important to fill on the run. I am going to
stay on the ballot.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides its effect on presidential politics, Lieberman's Senate
race has implications for the balance of power in Congress. If he
were elected to both jobs and resigned from the Senate, it would
fall to Republican Gov. John G. Rowland to appoint a replacement
who would serve until the next statewide election in 2002. Rowland
has said he will appoint a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, who is favored over Republican Philip Giordano, could
withdraw from the Senate race as late as Oct. 27 and still be
replaced by a Democratic Party nominee.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals' Rice OKs Deal, Vanishes  </HEADLINE>
By MEL REISNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Holdout defensive end Simeon Rice showed up
unannounced at the Arizona Cardinals' practice facility Wednesday,
agreed to a $4.25 million, one-year tender offer, took a physical
and then disappeared without consummating the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The vanishing act drew a heated reaction from general manager
Bob Ferguson.
</P>
<P>
   ''This happens too much in this business, and I'm tired of it,''
Ferguson said. ''We can't deal with these guys with kid gloves all
the time, and there comes a time when you've got to draw the line.
</P>
<P>
   ''This guy is a great football player who has a contract on the
table that is one of the top five in the league, because that's the
way it has to be with a franchise designation. That's there. I
don't know what else has to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson acknowledged telling Rice in no uncertain terms about
his obligation to the team, but denied causing Rice to change his
mind.
</P>
<P>
   Rice, a possible antidote to Arizona's dismal pass rush, spoke
with Ferguson for about five minutes in the morning. His visit was
unexpected, so the team had to scramble to line up a doctor for the
mandatory physical.
</P>
<P>
   Rice rode to and from the physical with an assistant trainer,
but instead of returning to Ferguson's office after they arrived
back at the team headquarters, he got into his car and drove away.
</P>
<P>
   Before the physical, Rice declined to speak with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had signed, he glowered and shot back, ''No.''
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, Rice characterized Phoenix as the ''armpit of the
world'' while fighting his designation as Arizona's franchise
player.
</P>
<P>
   But Ferguson said there were no recriminations during the
discussion. He asked Rice to consider the effect of his actions on
the team, which had no sacks and put little pressure on New York
Giants quarterback Kerry Collins during the season-opening 21-16
loss Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''When are we going to stop playing games and play football?''
Ferguson asked. ''We aren't playing it very well right now, but
we've got a team that can.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice had 44 sacks in his first four NFL seasons -- more than the
career total for Arizona's starting front four last week.
</P>
<P>
   He tied the NFL rookie record with 12&AMP;frac12; sacks in 1996 and set the
Cardinals franchise record last year with 16&AMP;frac12;.
</P>
<P>
   ''Exceptional quickness to rush the passer -- that's probably the
No. 1 asset that Simeon has,'' coach Vince Tobin said. ''He's an
unbelievably coordinated athlete that makes things happen as far as
rushing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tobin, speaking in advance of Rice's disappearance after
learning during practice about his visit, also said experience had
taught him not to count on a player until he suited up.
</P>
<P>
   ''We prepared without Simeon,'' Tobin said. ''We planned all
along if he wasn't in, because we couldn't do anything about it.''

<HEADLINE> Colombia Militia Enjoys Support  </HEADLINE>
By JUAN PABLO TORO
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Rightist militias waging a dirty war
against suspected leftists in Colombia enjoy growing support from
private businessmen, the nation's top paramilitary leader said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Castano, commander of the national paramilitary umbrella
organization known as the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia,
or AUC, made the unusually frank admission in a letter to a senate
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Castano did not name any of his alleged secret backers by name.
He claimed, however, that his 6,000-strong militias count on the
''growing support'' of local and international enterprises fed up
with leftist guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have always said we are defenders of free enterprise,''
read the two-page letter, faxed to local media, adding: ''How could
national and international companies whose investments are
constrained by the terrorism and barbarity of guerrillas...not
support us?''
</P>
<P>
   That some landowners and businesses in Colombia provide support
to paramilitary groups has been widely assumed, although little is
publicly known about those relationships.
</P>
<P>
   The militias arose during the 1980s as private armies formed by
landowners and drug traffickers to combat guerrilla extortion and
kidnappings. They have expanded rapidly in recent years and now
challenge leftist rebels for control over large drug-producing
regions.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian prosecutors and human rights groups have documented
ties between members of the military and the paramilitary groups,
who routinely massacre civilians suspected of having rebel
sympathies.
</P>
<P>
   A $1.3 billion U.S. anti-narcotics aid package heading to
Colombia later this year is conditioned on government progress in
reigning in the outlaw militias and severing their army
connections.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Devis, president of the Society of Colombian
Agriculturalists -- a powerful farmers' lobby -- confirmed that some
landowners have thrown their support behind the illegal militias
because the government is unable to provide security in rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
   ''This absurd war we are in has led people to have to contract
paramilitaries, self-defense groups or private security systems in
order to defend themselves,'' Devis told local Radionet Radio.

<HEADLINE> French Get Tough With Truckers  </HEADLINE>
By JOCELYN GECKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- French truckers stepped up a blockade of the
nation's fuel depots Wednesday as the government said it would make
no more concessions and demanded an end to protests that have
forced some gas stations to run dry.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Lionel Jospin took a tough line with the
truckers, saying their strike had ''inflicted a major handicap on
the French economy,'' and the government had reached its limit.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government will not go any farther. There will be no more
negotiations,'' Jospin told reporters after meeting with Transport
Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot, who spent the past two nights
negotiating with union leaders.
</P>
<P>
   French truckers have sealed off roads to nearly 100 of the
country's oil refineries and fuel depots since Sunday to protest
soaring fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   France has the second highest fuel prices in the European Union
after Britain. Unleaded gasoline costing $3.70 per gallon, of which
about 75 percent is tax. Diesel fuel in France costs $2.84 per
gallon, compared to a current average of $1.58 per gallon in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Since the blockade began Sunday, hundreds of gas stations have
run dry and local governments have begun rationing fuel as
motorists line up bumper-to-bumper at the pump.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in many regions have had to reserve gas for
emergency and police use. Some drivers crossed into neighboring
countries to fill their tanks.
</P>
<P>
   The dwindling fuel supply caused flights out of the Lyon airport
to be canceled or rerouted on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin's ultimatum to truckers came after his Green party allies
warned of a crisis within their coalition, saying his concessions
to truckers broke promises to promote environmental policies. The
Greens say France should favor rail traffic over the more polluting
trucks to carry freight.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a crisis, essentially, for the government, which has two
seemingly contradictory policies,'' said Green Party spokesman Yves
Cochet. He said the party planned to discuss whether its two
ecology ministers would step down from the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   The government has offered to give truckers a 20-cent
reimbursement per gallon of fuel this year, and a 14-cent refund
per gallon on gasoline taxes next year. But the main union wants an
additional tax break of 5.6 cents per gallon in 2001, said a
statement by the National Federation of Truck Drivers, the
country's largest trucker union.
</P>
<P>
   Two of France's three principal freight unions refused to accept
the government's offer Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The truckers' federation rejected the government's offer as
''insufficient'' and vowed to continue its nationwide blockades.
</P>
<P>
   A smaller union, Transport and Logistics of France, signed a
deal with the government Wednesday, while the head of the nation's
second-largest union, UNOSTRA, left negotiations saying union
members had to continue consultations before accepting the
government's terms.
</P>
<P>
   The movement was expected to snowball Thursday, with ambulance
drivers, taxi drivers and farmers voicing demands for lower taxes.
Taxi drivers planned a protest in Paris, which would likely cause
traffic jams and a shortage of cabs around the capital.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday morning, taxis staged what they called ''Operation
Escargot,'' in which taxis driving in from Paris' airports slowed
their speed to a snail's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The truckers' protest was inspired by last week's strike by
fishermen, who blocked ports for several days. The demonstrations
ended when the Agriculture Ministry agreed to compensate them for
rising fuel prices.

World Leaders Convene at U.N. Summit
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The world laid out its hopes for the third millennium
today at an extraordinary convocation of leaders great and obscure, with
President Clinton pleading for help in bringing peace to the Middle East before
it is too late. About 150 world leaders -- the greatest assembly of presidents,
prime ministers, monarchs and other rulers in history -- listened as Russian
President Vladimir Putin called for an international conference to outlaw the
militarization of space. And they heard Cuban President Fidel Castro, viewed by
many developing countries as their premier spokesman, decry the poverty that he
says afflicts 80 percent of the world's 6 billion people.

   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- A federal appeals court agreed today to set a
hearing for Wen Ho Lee's lawyers to argue that the accused nuclear scientist
should be released from jail. The Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Appeals Court,
which last week superseded a bail-release order signed by a federal judge in
Albuquerque, set the hearing for Monday in Denver. The defense had petitioned
the court to release the fired Los Alamos scientist, who has been jailed since
Dec. 10 while he awaits trial.

Study: Land Mine Ban Makes Difference
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- A global treaty to ban the use of land mines has made a
significant difference in its first 18 months, but major blackspots -- among
them Chechnya, Kosovo and Myanmar -- remain, anti-mine campaigners said
Thursday. Angola continues to use the weapons although it has signed the treaty,
while Burundi and Sudan ''likely'' do so, according to the Landmine Monitor 2000
report. Sudan has denied the allegation. The study said Yugoslav forces laid
some 50,000 land mines during the Kosovo conflict.

human protein that scientists say is the first direct evidence of cannibalism
among the Anasazi, whose empire stretched into present-day Colorado, Arizona,

<HEADLINE> Land Mine Menace in Lebanon  </HEADLINE>
By RODEINA KENAAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAWTAR SHARQIYEH, Lebanon (AP) -- Boyish curiosity drew Ammar
Serhal to an abandoned Israeli position near his village, one of
scores of bases and checkpoints hastily vacated as Israel ended its
occupation of south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   There, the 12-year-old discovered that though the shooting and
shelling of the volatile occupation years was over, Lebanon had not
seen the end of the heartache. On the very day Israel pulled out --
May 24 -- he stepped on an antipersonnel mine that chopped off his
left leg above the knee and badly damaged his right leg.
</P>
<P>
   International anti-mine campaigners said Thursday that a global
treaty against the use of mines has made a difference in the first
year and a half of its life, but problems remain. Countries that
have ratified the treaty were to meet in Switzerland next week.
Neither Israel nor Lebanon has signed the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   According to police, nine people have died and 62 others injured
in explosions of land mines and unexploded shells since the Israeli
withdrawal from the border zone it held in Lebanon for 18 years as
a buffer against cross-border guerrilla attack.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officers estimate at least 50,000 mines were planted, most
by Israel and its Lebanese militia allies in their fight against
elusive guerrillas. Guerrillas also planted mines.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanese authorities had planned an awareness campaign to warn
people of the danger of mines and unexploded shells. The Israelis'
withdrawal six weeks ahead of their self-declared deadline of July
7 lent urgency to the brochures, posters and warnings on radio and
television, which began just as the first casualties started coming
in. Thousands of people flooded south Lebanon after Israeli troops
left to return home or to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   On May 24, Ammar ventured to the vacated hilltop Israeli
position of Ali Taher, from where his Shiite Muslim village of
Zawtar Sharqiyeh, 47 miles southeast of Beirut, had been targeted
by gunfire and shelling almost every day during the Israeli
occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Ammar said the mine that maimed him did not kill his dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I will still be able to become a history teacher and
draw paintings as I always wanted. But I don't think I will be able
to play soccer anymore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese army and U.N. peacekeepers are clearing mines in
the southern region which, counting the former Israeli-occupied
zone and the front line, amounts to more than 10 percent of
Lebanese territory. The effort is hindered by the difficult
terrain, lack of maps and limited funding.
</P>
<P>
   The government has said $8.6 million was needed to clear the
south of land mines.

<HEADLINE> NJ Train Derailment Slows Commute  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELIZABETH, N.J. (AP) -- Four cars of a 59-car freight train went
off the tracks early Wednesday, causing delays for commuter trains.
</P>
<P>
   The CSX train, being operated on Amtrak tracks, was headed from
Selkirk, N.Y., to Metuchen, N.J., with a load of parts for auto
assembly plants. No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the derailment, which happened about 2 a.m., was
not known.
</P>
<P>
   The derailment delayed thousands of rail commuters who had to be
put on buses and driven around the accident Wednesday. Crews
expected to have the train on its way by late evening.
</P>
<P>
   NJ Transit rail riders and Amtrak passengers faced delays of up
to 20 minutes on the Northeast Corridor and North Jersey Coast
Line. Minimal delays were reported after 8 a.m., said Cecilia
Cummings, a spokeswoman for Amtrak's Northeast Corridor.
</P>
<P>
   ''We came through much better than we expected to in terms of
delays,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Bengals' Smith Eager to Play  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Donovan McNabb led a drubbing of Dallas.
Daunte Culpepper ran for three touchdowns. Cade McNown threw for
two touchdowns and ran for another. Tim Couch kept Cleveland close
for a half.
</P>
<P>
   What was Akili Smith doing while the rest of the quarterback
class of '99 was strutting its stuff? Watching on television,
feeling left out.
</P>
<P>
   The Cincinnati Bengals opened the season with a bye, making
Smith a spectator for the first week. He didn't like it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm real anxious to get out there,'' Smith said Wednesday. ''I
was sitting back and watching the stats of all the younger
quarterbacks and everybody had a pretty good opening day. I want to
go out there and kind of do the same things they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Couch wasn't bad, going 19-of-27 with a touchdown in the Browns'
27-7 loss to Jacksonville. Couch and the Browns will visit Sunday
for the first regular-season game at Paul Brown Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It will be Smith's most important game since Oct. 10 last year,
when he made his first NFL start in Cleveland, led a last-minute
touchdown drive for an 18-17 win and pounded his chest at the
Browns' bench, rekindling a rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   This time, he's starting the first meaningful game in the new
stadium that's supposed to mark the beginning of a new era for the
NFL's most forlorn team.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know this game is about teammates and that stuff, but I know
there's a lot of pressure on me to get it done and I'm ready to
take it on,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, Smith is putting less emphasis on his second game
against Cleveland, the team that chose Couch instead of him for the
No. 1 overall pick last year. He wouldn't talk about his
chest-thumping celebration or his old grudge.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's said was last year and I'm going to move on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   First, he's got to make up some ground. Smith noticed that the
other first-round quarterbacks from '99 got a lot of media
attention in the preseason, while he and the Bengals were glossed
over.
</P>
<P>
   Even though there's a good reason for it -- the Bengals had the
NFL's worst record in the 1990s -- Smith felt overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yeah, I watched all those shows,'' he said. ''It's nothing I
haven't been dealing with my whole career. I just haven't had a
chance to prove myself yet. I'll get my chance on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals decided to start Smith against Cleveland last season
because it represented his best chance to make a successful debut --
playing a winless expansion team.
</P>
<P>
   The game against Cleveland on Sunday also represents a good
chance to look good. Even though the Browns' defense had four sacks
and was more resilient against Jacksonville, it allowed Mark
Brunell to throw for 301 yards and lead drives of 15, 12, 10 and 17
plays.
</P>
<P>
   Smith will get to attack it more directly this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''In his first game last year against Cleveland, he was still
kind of getting the concept of playing quarterback in this
league,'' offensive tackle Willie Anderson said. ''The game plan is
going to be bigger than it was last year for him. It will give him
a lot more shots to get the ball down the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith has been studying film of the Browns' defense since
preseason. He was so eager to get acquainted with the game plan
that he stuck around Paul Brown Stadium until late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was here last night until like 9 o'clock watching film and
waiting for us to give him the game plan,'' coach Bruce Coslet
said. ''He just stayed and had dinner with us.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's doing everything he can to be good and it started in
February, so I have nothing but praise for him. He's earned it.''

<HEADLINE> Lieberman Takes Ride on a Harley  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Joseph Lieberman, a senator normally
known for quiet demeanor, donned a motorcycle helmet Wednesday and
took a quick spin on the back of a Harley-Davidson.
</P>
<P>
   It was all in the service of the presidential campaign -- though
Lieberman later told an aide, ''I have a new fantasy. I want to buy
a Harley-Davidson.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, Al Gore's Democratic running mate, spent some time
answering questions from workers on a motorcycle assembly line.
Then, with his motorcade waiting, a smiling Lieberman got on the
back of a green motorcycle driven by employee Ted Harris and waved
to reporters and employees as they circled the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman then jumped off and got into his waiting car.
</P>
<P>
   Unannounced and done at the end of his appearance, Lieberman's
ride wasn't captured by television and newspaper photographers.
However, an employee got a photo.
</P>
<P>
   He later acknowledged that ''there was some pressure'' not to
ride. Aides apparently feared a repetition of the ridicule Michael
Dukakis got when he put on a helmet and rode in a tank during his
presidential campaign in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he did it anyway, Lieberman said he had made a
''promise to the guys on the line. ... Besides, I had a good
time.'' Referring to the Dukakis ride, he joked that his decision
to put on the helmet was ''another act of courage.''
</P>
<P>
   At the plant, the blue jeans-clad Lieberman walked through,
shaking hands with workers who were attaching tires and handlebars.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lieberman's wife Hadassah made her first solo
campaign trip to Minneapolis, where she visited an urban Head Start
preschool program and participated in a discussion on women's
economic issues.

<HEADLINE> Texas Ends Year With Surplus  </HEADLINE>
By NATALIE GOTT
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Texas ended its fiscal year with $45
million more in the bank than July estimates showed, pushing its
surplus to $1.45 billion, the state comptroller said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The state's budget became a presidential campaign issue in July
when a legislative report projected that $610 million in cost
overruns in some programs would cut into the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Some Texas Democrats blamed the overruns on a $1.7 billion tax
cut that Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee,
advocated and signed into law in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators said the newly announced surplus would more than
cover any excess spending. The state ended its fiscal year on Aug.
31.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Comptroller Carole Keeton Rylander, a Republican, also
said the state will put about $103 million -- $55 million more than
originally estimated -- into its rainy day fund because of
additional revenues collected from natural gas severance taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee said the
state might have to use about $610 million of the budget surplus,
which amounted to more than $1 billion at the time, to keep the
overall $98.2 billion budget out of the red.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers blamed the overruns on higher Medicaid prescription
drug costs, a larger prison population in county jails and bad
budget assumptions by two state agencies.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Mario Gallegos, a Houston Democrat who had accused
the state of cooking the budget figures to fatten the surplus, said
Wednesday he would not believe a surplus exists until he knew how
much those departments faced in shortfalls.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before we start the balloons and the confetti on the surplus,
I'd like to know what kind of cut we are going to take,'' Gallegos
said.
</P>
<P>
   On a July campaign visit to San Antonio, Democratic presidential
candidate Al Gore said the budget shortfall demonstrated that
Bush's economic proposals would return the country to deficit
spending and raise its debt.
</P>
<P>
   ''This confirms what the governor has been saying -- that he has
worked with the Texas Legislature to be fiscally responsible and as
a result, the state is ending the fiscal year with a sizable
surplus,'' Linda Edwards, a gubernatorial spokeswoman for Bush,
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign declined to comment Wednesday, saying it
needed more details.
</P>
<P>
   In her report, Rylander said the state ended the fiscal year
with $3.8 billion in the general fund, which includes funds
dedicated to various special purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, state spending was lower than originally estimated by
state budget analysts, she said.

<HEADLINE> Carmody Heads to Northwestern  </HEADLINE>
By RICK GANO
<TEXT>
<P>
   EVANSTON, Ill. (AP) -- Bill Carmody pulled an all-nighter, fired
up the VCR and let his early morning viewing help him make one of
the biggest decisions of his life.
</P>
<P>
   After 18 years at Princeton, the last four as head coach, it was
time to leave and take on one of college basketball's biggest
challenges at Northwestern.
</P>
<P>
   ''I came out Saturday night for about five hours, took a flight
back to New Jersey and got back about 1 in the morning. I took
about four game tapes with me and I looked at the team from 2 till
5:30 in the morning,'' Carmody said Wednesday when he was
introduced as Northwestern's new coach.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I saw was a bunch of hard-working guys who I thought were
overmatched physically,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''But they were trying to do what their coach was trying to have
them do. Right there I sort of knew they were the type of guys who
will listen and get better. That sort of made my decision right
there. I knew we had good kids and that's important.''
</P>
<P>
   Carmody must again mix academics and athletics and said that is
one reason he's always been intrigued by the Northwestern job. And
now he'll be able to give athletic scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   But winning, as he did often at Princeton where he was 92-25 in
four years after replacing Pete Carril, won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of Dartmouth and Cornell, he'll be going against
Michigan State and Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Northwestern was 5-25 last season, didn't win a game in the Big
Ten and now must adjust to a new coach following the abrupt
resignation of Kevin O'Neill, who left last week to become an
assistant with the New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I come in with my eyes open. I know it's going to be a rough
situation,'' Carmody, 48, said.
</P>
<P>
   Under Carmody, the Tigers went to the postseason each year.
Princeton made the NCAA tournament after going undefeated in Ivy
League play his first two seasons, and advanced to the second round
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers went to the NIT the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Carmody's best season was 1997-98, when the Tigers went 27-2 and
were ranked as high as No. 8 during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ''You look at 92-25 and it doesn't matter if that's CYO or YMCA
or major college basketball, that stands out and gets your
attention,'' Northwestern athletic director Rick Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There have been some who have said, 'Well it's the Ivy
league.' But it's not all Ivy league. Look at his record against
Division I scholarship teams (33-17).''
</P>
<P>
   There is an impression that Princeton still wins by holding the
ball with a deliberate style that is low scoring and frustrating
for defenses.
</P>
<P>
   But Carmody says his teams play a style that is suited to their
talent, not a system. He quickly moved to convince some of
Northwestern's players.
</P>
<P>
   ''I talked to Tavaras Hardy and I knew he was apprehensive. I
think most of the team members are apprehensive about Princeton
basketball. What does that mean? It scares a lot of guys,'' Carmody
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tried to tell them I'm not trying to bring a Princeton
system here and I'm not trying to make Northwestern the Princeton
of the Big Ten.
</P>
<P>
   ''The offense is very free and open and flowing. I showed some
of the players a tape from Princeton. We're not holding the ball,
that's a perception. It's not a dictatorship. The players will tell
you how to play. It's basketball. Guard your man, make shots and
let's go.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardy was convinced he could learn whatever system the new coach
decides to use.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know much about the Princeton system other than what I
heard and I read,'' Hardy said. ''They won games and that's what we
are trying to do. We have smart players. We're not Ivy Leaguers but
Northwestern is not an easy school to get into. Our players are
very capable of learning.''
</P>
<P>
   When Carmody was an assistant under Carril, the Tigers were
251-125 (.668), winning four straight Ivy League titles (1989-92)
and seven overall. They also lost four first-round NCAA tournament
games by a total of just 15 points using their patient passing game
that often led to backdoor layups.
</P>
<P>
   Their biggest victory came in 1996 when they upset defending
national champion UCLA in the first round of the NCAA tournament
after Carril had already announced he was retiring and Carmody was
chosen his successor.

<HEADLINE> Lee To Get Hearing, Court Says  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD BENKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- A federal appeals court agreed
Wednesday to set a hearing for Wen Ho Lee's lawyers to argue that
the accused nuclear scientist should be released from jail.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Appeals Court, which last
week superseded a bail-release order signed by a federal judge in
Albuquerque, set the hearing for Monday in Denver. The hearing will
be closed to the public for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The defense had petitioned the court to release the fired Los
Alamos scientist, who has been jailed since Dec. 10 while he awaits
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''Surely it does not serve the public interest to maintain an
imprisonment that erodes the basic sense of fairness that
undergirds the Constitution,'' Lee's attorneys wrote in a motion
filed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 60, is accused of downloading restricted material about
nuclear weapons to unsecured computers and tapes while he worked at
the Los Alamos National Laboratory. He has been charged with 59
counts, and could face life in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge James Parker, who signed Lee's release on $1
million bail last week, sent the appeals court a 17-page memorandum
on Friday explaining his reasoning. He said he was concerned the
appeals court might not have enough time to review all the
evidence, much of it classified, to make a well-reasoned ruling.
</P>
<P>
   In the memo, Parker said the government had failed to present
convincing arguments for keeping Lee in the Santa Fe County jail
pending trial, scheduled for Nov. 6. The judge also said he wasn't
convinced that the material Lee is accused of mishandling were the
''crown jewels'' of U.S. nuclear technology, as the government
contends.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the government ''has never presented direct
evidence that Dr. Lee intended to harm the United States or to
secure an advantage for a foreign nation.'' Prosecutors must prove
those two elements to convict Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, the defense renewed its request that Parker
dismiss all but 10 counts of the 59-count indictment against Lee
because the files that Lee allegedly mishandled were not classified
secret at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ''The prosecution plainly drafted the indictment to leave the
impression that the files were classified at the time of the
events,'' the defense wrote, responding to the prosecution's
refusal to reduce the charges.
</P>
<P>
   A phone message left for the U.S. attorney's office was not
immediately returned late Wednesday afternoon.

<HEADLINE> NFL's 32nd Franchise to Be 'Texans'  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL A. LUTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- A not-too-well-kept secret was revealed Wednesday
when Houston owner Bob McNair announced the nickname of the NFL's
32nd franchise will be the Texans.
</P>
<P>
   The name won out over the Stallions and Apollos.
</P>
<P>
   ''Are you ready for some football?'' McNair shouted to a
downtown crowd estimated at 16,000 which turned out to learn the
team's name, logo and colors.
</P>
<P>
   The colors for the team that will begin play in 2002 will be
battle red, steel blue and liberty white with a bull's head logo
that includes a Texas Lone Star on one side.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're so excited about the return of the NFL to Houston,''
McNair said. ''We don't want to be stereotyped as cowboys. We are
proud of our past but we don't want to be bound by it.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking out over a stretch of downtown Texas Avenue that was
turned into a football field, complete with goal posts, NFL
commissioner Paul Tagliabue revealed the team name and logo on a
large screen.
</P>
<P>
   ''With teamwork you can achieve the impossible,'' Tagliabue
said. ''Not many years ago, you thought 'it's not going to happen,'
but it did happen and you can be proud of yourselves. You made it
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair paid $700 million for the franchise in a lengthy battle
with Los Angeles, a favored place for the NFL because of the size
of its media market. But Los Angeles never presented a unified plan
and McNair won the team.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd that showed up on a steamy afternoon reacted
positively to the new name. Several spectators grabbed their cell
phones to spread the word. ''Yeah, it's the Texans,'' one man
shouted into his phone.
</P>
<P>
   Another fan, Chris Lockeridge, beamed beneath his hard hat which
bore a sign with the year 2002 and a question mark attached.
</P>
<P>
   ''I rooted for the Oilers and now I'll be rooting for the
Texans,'' Lockeridge said. ''It doesn't matter what they're called.
I'll root for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The team labeled the day ''The Big Return,'' with the Texans
replacing the Houston Oilers, who left for Tennessee after the 1996
season.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've developed a name and logo that fans throughout the area
and around the country and world will embrace for years to come,''
McNair said. ''It is a logo worthy of the name and the brand of
football I expect our team to play.
</P>
<P>
   ''The name and logo embody the pride, strength, independence,
courage and achievement that make the people of Houston and our
area special.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, former NFL kicker Raul Allegre staged a kickoff in the
Astrodome to former players from Texas Southern, the University of
Houston and Rice University to symbolically get the day of
celebration started.
</P>
<P>
   McNair said the footballs would be delivered to the mayors in
Austin, San Antonio and Beaumont as part of the nickname
announcement in those cities. Presentations to other cities were
planned for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A 69,500-seat retractable roof stadium is under construction
adjacent to the Astrodome that will house the new NFL team and the
Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo beginning in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   McNair has even bigger plans for his new stadium. He is
preparing a presentation to the NFL and expects not only to get the
2004 Super Bowl in Houston, but to become a part of the Super Bowl
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Several former Oilers and former coach Bum Phillips were present
at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   University of Texas fans, noting the similarity of the Texans'
bull logo and their own Longhorns mascot, immediately started
waving their ''Hook 'em horns'' hand signal, including Lockeridge.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll just have to shorten it a bit for the Texans, '' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Official: Sailors Died Immediately  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- A deputy prime minister said Wednesday that there
had never been any contact with the 118 Russian sailors aboard the
Kursk nuclear submarine after it sank Aug. 12, and they were
probably all killed instantly.
</P>
<P>
   Navy officials had said several times that they heard tapping
from inside the submarine the first few days after it went down
during exercises in the Barents Sea, indicating some crew members
were alive. That encouraged rescuers who spent a week trying to
open the vessel.
</P>
<P>
   But Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov, who leads the
government commission handling the disaster, said Wednesday,
''Almost certainly, once it was on the sea floor, no one was left
alive.''
</P>
<P>
   The reports of tapping ''turned out to be mistaken ... because
of a mistaken analysis,'' he said in remarks aired on Russia's
television networks. He did not elaborate. Other, lower-ranking
officials had acknowledged before that there had been no pounding.
</P>
<P>
   When divers finally made it inside nine days after the
explosions that disabled the vessel, they found a flooded ship and
no survivors.
</P>
<P>
   The navy was widely criticized for bungling the rescue effort
and being slow to accept foreign help. Throughout the tense rescue
effort, navy and government officials -- including Klebanov -- gave
contradictory and confusing accounts of what was going on.

<HEADLINE> Heat Wave Can't Stop Texas Football  </HEADLINE>
By JIM VERTUNO
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- The grass is brown and brittle. At 112
degrees, it's so hot even the dust seems reluctant to move.
</P>
<P>
   If this were Hollywood, tumbleweeds would be blowing through the
end zone.
</P>
<P>
   But this is Texas, where high school football is king, and
nothing like a few hot days, or even a lot of them, are enough to
stop the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's never too hot to play football,'' Connally High School
quarterback Deron Ellis says.
</P>
<P>
   With the late afternoon sun pounding his black helmet, Ellis
bends over for a drink of water from a sideline cooler. He blinks
furiously to keep his eyes moist in the face of a fierce wind that
feels like blast of air from an oven.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is bad. We usually get a cool breeze to help. This is
more like a hot smack in your face,'' Ellis says.
</P>
<P>
   A combination of drought, low humidity and a stationary dome of
hot air sent temperatures in Austin soaring to a record 112 degrees
Tuesday, beating the previous high of 110 set a day earlier. While
Ellis and his teammates were running around a football field, it
was cooler in Death Valley, Calif., which topped out at 101.
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday, the temperature in Austin has topped 100
degrees on 37 days this year. The thermometer has been in triple
digits for 58 days in Del Rio, 45 days in College Station, 44 days
in Dallas-Fort Worth, and 21 days in San Antonio. Wednesday's highs
hit the 90s as a weak cool front pushed through the state, but Del
Rio still managed to hit 110.
</P>
<P>
   ''You look at the five-day forecast and everything is the
100s,'' Connally coach Matt Monzingo said. ''It's ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, a break may be on the horizon. Temperatures across the
state are expected to cool off into the high 90s by Thursday and
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The heat has forced high school coaches and officials to make
adjustments to protect their players against heat exhaustion or
heat stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Some schools have pushed back starting times for night games and
even canceled some junior varsity and middle school games.
</P>
<P>
   Others have shortened practice times or forgone the use of
shoulder pads during the heat wave.
</P>
<P>
   ''I let the kids know anytime they feel weak or lightheaded,
they need to take a little break,'' Dallas Samuell coach Steve
Pierce said. ''We provide ice water and sport drinks and push them
to hydrate themselves as much as possible before they even go
out.''
</P>
<P>
   At Connally, about a dozen water coolers line the practice
field. Players drape towels soaked in ice water over their heads.
The team takes about four or five water breaks during the two-hour
practice but each player is allowed to get a drink when he wants
one.
</P>
<P>
   The coaching staff encourages players to drink a lot of water
during the day before practice even starts.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've only had one kid drop out of practice because he felt he
was dehydrated,'' Monzingo said. ''The other staff in school have
been good about reminding the kids to drink a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, high levels of activity in extreme temperatures can be
dangerous, says Dr. Mark Hutchens, director of athletic medicine at
the University of Texas. ''Anything over a hundred and you're
pretty much in danger level.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally, heat exhaustion is caused by loss of body fluids and
important salts. If untreated, heat exhaustion can lead to heat
stroke, a medical emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms of heat exhaustion include headache, nausea, fatigue,
dizziness or lightheadedness. Victims may faint.
</P>
<P>
   Heat stroke symptoms include headache, flushed skin, rapid
pulse, incoherent speech and disorientation. Victims could lose
consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Garland coach Joe Martin said the heat is mentally taxing as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ''We try to put it out of our minds and not talk about how hot
it is,'' Martin said. ''The other day, when it was 112 or whatever
it was, the kids were lining up to start practice talking about how
cool it was.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you stand out by our door at the field house, you won't
hear too many say it's hot, but you'll hear, 'Boy, it's cool out
here,' and everybody will laugh,'' Martin said.

<HEADLINE> 2nd Athlete Kicked off Canada Team  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- A second athlete in as many days has been kicked
off the Canadian Olympic team following a positive drug test.
</P>
<P>
   A director for the Canadian Centre for Ethics in Sport, which
performed the test, said Wednesday that equestrian rider Eric
Lamaze has tested positive for cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, hammer thrower Robin Lyons was removed from the team
after testing positive for an anabolic steroid.
</P>
<P>
   She has appealed the results of the tests taken last month at
the Canadian Olympic trials where she set a meet record with a toss
of 205 feet, 8 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Athletics Canada helped Lyons protest the infraction to the CCES
in hopes of clearing her in time to compete in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   CCES director Casey Wade said the Centre would not comment
further on Lamaze's situation.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Canadian Equestrian Federation said they
were expecting test results from CCES on Thursday and would not
confirm the report.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't say anything,'' federation media relations
co-ordinator Jennifer Ward said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she is aware that ''there is something under review''
but added they ''do not know what or with which athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward said Lamaze has withdrawn from this weekend's Masters
competition at Spruce Meadows in Calgary and the Canadian team will
be replacing him on the Nation's Cup team Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   He was to compete in the team and individual jumping events in
Sydney. Lamaze, riding Millcreek Raphael, was selected in July to
the Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   Terrance Millar, manager of the equestrian team, called news of
the positive test ''devastating'' and ''sad.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He's had a brilliant year,'' Millar said. ''Here's a guy who's
at the very top of his game.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss is expected to hurt the team's chances in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was maybe the top horse-rider combination,'' Millar said.
''He was a lynch pin on our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamaze, a former Canadian equestrian champion, also tested
positive in 1996 and was suspended from competition for four years.
His suspension was commuted to seven months after he appealed on
the grounds he took cocaine four times in three months before the
1996 Olympic trials for personal use rather than to gain any
competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
   Lamaze could not be reached at his Torrey Pines Stables in
Stromberg, Ontario, for comment.

<HEADLINE> Church Group: Lift Cuba Embargo  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- A leading U.S. church group on Wednesday urged
President Clinton to lift the American trade embargo against Cuba
before he leaves office rather than hand the matter to his
successor.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the right moment to lift the embargo,'' the Rev. Robert
Edgar, secretary general of the U.S. National Council of Churches
told a news conference in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton does nothing, ''years could pass'' before the
sanctions end, he said. Clinton leaves office in less than five
months.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar and seven other council representatives arrived on the
island on Aug. 2 for a visit that winds up on Thursday. The council
is made up of 35 denominations.
</P>
<P>
   The council played a key role in the saga of Elian Gonzalez, the
6-year-old Cuban boy who was at the center of a protracted custody
battle between relatives on both sides of the Florida Straits.
</P>
<P>
   Council members supported Elian's relatives in Cuba in their
fight to have the child repatriated. The boy's Miami relatives
fought unsuccessfully to keep the boy with them in the United
States after his mother and 10 others perished at sea.
</P>
<P>
   During their visit, the American church leaders visited Elian's
hometown in Cardenas, about a two-hour's drive east of Havana. They
donated erasers, pencils and other classroom supplies to Elian's
school and visited with the child's father, Juan Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had the opportunity to see Elian Gonzalez seated in his
classroom, doing his work,'' Edgar said. Out of respect for the
boy's privacy, council members decided not to ask to speak with
him.

<HEADLINE> Hagelin Files for Federal Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Reform Party presidential hopeful John Hagelin
has filed papers with federal election officials laying claim to
$12.6 million reserved for the party's nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin officials said the forms, filed Friday with the Federal
Election Commission, reflect that he is on the ballot in 11 states
as the party's candidate for president.
</P>
<P>
   Election law requires a ''minor party'' candidate seeking
federal funding to certify they are on the ballot in at least 10
states.
</P>
<P>
   The FEC has 10 days after the all the necessary papers are filed
to issue a ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan, who also claims the party nomination, filed
similar documents a week earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Both Hagelin and Buchanan claimed the Reform mantle last month
at the party's convention, which ended with naming of separate
presidential nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin officials said he is on the ballot in Arizona, Colorado,
Idaho, Illinois, New Mexico, Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee, Utah,
Washington state and Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   But Wyoming's secretary of state announced Wednesday that
Buchanan will be on the ballot as the Reform Party's candidate.
Hagelin is to appear under the Natural Law Party banner,
disqualifying him from appearing on another part of the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Hagelin and his allies filed a claim in a California
state court asking a judge to declare him and running mate Nat
Goldhaber the sole nominees.
</P>
<P>
   The action followed by one day a similar claim by Buchanan's
faction seeking legal recognition of Buchanan and running mate
Ezola Foster as the true nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides argue that because the national convention was held
in Long Beach, the state court there has jurisdiction over party
activities nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing on the matter was scheduled for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In Wisconsin, the state elections board said both men will
appear on the ballot, listed in the section for independent
candidates but identified as being affiliated with the Reform
Party.

<HEADLINE> FSU's Williams Sidelined  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Starting offensive tackle Brett
Williams could miss Florida State's game against Georgia Tech on
Saturday because of a severely sprained left ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Williams has been trying to play despite the injury, which
occurred during the first week of two-a-day practices in August. An
MRI of the ankle confirmed Williams' ligaments are swollen.
</P>
<P>
   The sophomore left in the second quarter of the second-ranked
Seminoles' 29-3 victory over Brigham Young on Aug. 26, after
experiencing pain in his leg. But says he's confident that he will
be back in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ''(The ankle) should bother me all year, pain wise, but I'll get
better to where the pain doesn't bother me, and I can play,''
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Charron Dorsey, a 6-foot-7, 325-pound tackle, is expected to
fill in for Williams. It would be the senior's first career start
at offensive tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I had a choice, I'd probably redshirt to make me better,''
Dorsey said. ''Coaches felt players were getting tired, so I'm an
extra body to help the guys out.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he would play Saturday should an offensive lineman
get injured. He is listed as questionable.
</P>
<P>
   As a freshman last season, Williams earned second-team
All-Atlantic Coast Conference honors as the Seminoles won the
national championship. He started the final seven games of the
season in place of the injured Ross Brannon.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTPORT, Conn. (AP) -- Lawrence Fellows, a former foreign
correspondent and chief Connecticut correspondent for The New York
Times, died Saturday of a heart attack. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   Fellows began his career with the Times as a general assignment
reporter in Manhattan and as a correspondent at the United Nations
from 1953 to 1978. He went overseas from 1959 to 1972, based in
Jerusalem; London; Nairobi, Kenya; and Bonn, Germany. He then spent
six years as chief correspondent in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   As a correspondent based in Israel from 1959 to 1962, Fellows
covered the trial of Adolf Eichmann and violence in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
   While in London from 1962 to 1965 he covered the scandal
surrounding the war minister, John Profumo, who resigned after
lying about his affair with a call girl. Fellows then returned to
Cyprus to cover fighting between Greeks and Turks.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, the Times published a long dispatch from Sudan in which
Fellows reported on an untold number of casualties in a six-year
revolt.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, Fellows reported on the kidnapping and murder of
Israeli athletes by Arab terrorists at the Munich Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by two daughters and
three grandchildren.
R.H. Harris:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- R.H. Harris, a gospel pioneer and the last
surviving member of the original Soul Stirrers, died Sunday. He was
84.
</P>
<P>
   Gospel expert Anthony Heilbut called Harris, whose Chicago-based
band was inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame in 1989,
''the most influential figure in soul music.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris joined the group in 1931, two months before the band
changed its name to the Five Soul Stirrers.
</P>
<P>
   Using falsetto while singing a high second lead, Harris enabled
four-part harmonies and a back beat that musical historians say
became a model for soul and rhythm and blues and quartets that
performed with Duke Ellington and Cab Calloway.
George ''Moose'' Musso:
</P>
<P>
   EDWARDSVILLE, Ill. (AP) -- George ''Moose'' Musso, a lineman who
played on four Chicago Bears championship teams and was inducted
into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, died Tuesday. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Musso was a Bear from 1933 to 1944 and was inducted to the Hall
of Fame in 1982. He played in seven NFL championship games under
Bears founder and coach George Halas, including the 72-0 thrashing
of the Washington Redskins in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   While in college, he played against two future presidents,
Ronald Reagan at Eureka and Gerald Ford at Michigan.

<HEADLINE> Big Brother Shake Up Fails  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- An attempt by producers to shake up the
faltering reality show ''Big Brother'' failed Wednesday when none
of the six remaining contestants would take $50,000 to walk out of
the house.
</P>
<P>
   Producers had hoped someone would leave so they could bring
another person into the camera-infested home -- an attractive,
opinionated, 22-year-old blonde woman.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's one-hour episode was yet another example of how
things continue to go wrong for the CBS show, which is slumping in
the ratings and ridiculed by critics. It has 24 days to go before
one remaining contestant wins a half million dollars by surviving
the experiment in voyeuristic living.
</P>
<P>
   The rejection of the inducement -- or bribe -- to leave was
presaged Tuesday when a woman with a megaphone warned from outside
the walls of the Hollywood soundstage warned that it was coming and
that it was a trick. The contestants discussed it among themselves
and decided they would stay.
</P>
<P>
   So it was no surprise Wednesday when Julie Chen said a suitcase
with $20,000 in cash was available to anyone who would walk out.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a night at the bar for me,'' said Long Islander Eddie
disdainfully.
</P>
<P>
   Host Julie Chen then offered another suitcase with $30,000. The
contestants thought a little harder about this; three will
eventually go home empty-handed, the second-place contestant wins
$100,000 and the third-place contestant wins $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Again, no one took the offer, even though three contestants --
Eddie, affable lawyer Curtis and United Nations worker Cassandra --
were ''marked for banishment.'' Viewers voting online will remove
one of them from the house during the next week.
</P>
<P>
   Chen seemed surprised. ''Congratulations on your resolve,'' she
said in a disappointed voice.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they're all insane not to take that money,'' said
Beth, the woman who would have replaced any contestant who left.
</P>
<P>
   Beth was clearly introduced to spice up the proceedings: a film
clip showed her in a tiny bikini. In an interview, she said, ''I'm
opinionated, and sometimes that's misconstrued as being a bitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she'll stay on the outside.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly worried that the six remaining contestants aren't
interesting enough, producers spent roughly half of Wednesday
night's show featuring people who had already been voted out of the
house.
</P>
<P>
   Midwestern housewife Karen, who said she stayed up all night
after she was voted out of the house reading about herself online,
has left her husband and moved to California. Brittany, the virgin
with the ever-changing hair colors who was voted out last week, is
moving in with her.
</P>
<P>
   Brought back for an interview Wednesday night, Brittany told her
former housemates that ''it's mean outside.'' But she wasn't too
enamored with life inside the ''Big Brother'' house, either.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not healthy in that house,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Indians 6, Devil Rays 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Roberto Alomar homered twice, and Chuck Finley
combined with Paul Shuey on a four-hitter as the Cleveland Indians
beat the Tampa Bay Devil Rays 6-2 Wednesday night for their fourth
straight win.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland, the AL wild-card race leader, is 23-10 since Aug. 2.
The Indians are 8-1 against the Devil Rays this season and 20-8
since Tampa Bay started play in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Finley (12-10) allowed two runs and four hits in seven innings
and struck out seven to win for the third time in his last four
starts. He is 4-0 with a 1.31 ERA in his career against Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Bench coach Bill Russell managed the Devil Rays. Tampa Bay
manager Larry Rothschild began serving a three-game suspension
imposed by the commissioner's office for his actions during the
Devil Rays' brawls against Boston on Aug. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Alomar's two-run homer off Ryan Rupe put Cleveland ahead in the
third, a 430-foot drive off the facade of the second in right.
Rookie Steve Cox tied it with a two-out, two-run homer in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Alomar singled and stole second in the fifth, then scored on Jim
Thome's RBI single off Travis Harper (0-1).
</P>
<P>
   Alomar led off the seventh with his 18th homer, a drive into the
seats in right-center for his third two-homer game this season and
10th of his career. Travis Fryman and Wil Cordero each had
run-scoring singles later in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Devil Rays starter Ryan Rupe left after three innings with
stiffness in his right biceps.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Finley improved to 8-2 in 13 starts at Jacobs Field this
season. ... Tampa Bay is 31-71 (.304) against left-handed starters
in team history, including 10-22 this season. ... Cleveland's Manny
Ramirez went 0-for-3 with a walk, stopping his 20-game hitting
streak. ... ... Tampa Bay's Bobby Smith struck out three times
against Finley and has fanned six times in going 0-for-7 in the
series.

<HEADLINE> Blue Jays 7, Mariners 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Carlos Delgado hit a three-run double and Joey
Hamilton pitched seven effective innings as the Toronto Blue Jays
beat the Seattle Mariners 7-3 Wednesday night to stop a four-game
losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Rodriguez hit a two-run homer for the AL West-leading
Mariners, who have lost 17 of their last 23 games. Seattle had won
its previous seven games at SkyDome.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton (2-0) gave up two runs and four hits. The 29-year-old
right-hander, who underwent shoulder surgery last September, has
made four starts since being activated from the disabled list on
Aug. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton has pitched 26 innings in his return and not allowed a
run in 22 of them.
</P>
<P>
   Down 2-1 in the fourth, the Blue Jays scored five runs in
chasing John Halama (11-8).
</P>
<P>
   Jose Cruz and Darrin Fletcher hit consecutive singles and Craig
Grebeck hit an RBI double. Reliever Brett Tomko loaded the bases by
walking Shannon Stewart, then fanned Alex Gonzalez for the second
out.
</P>
<P>
   But Tomko hit Chad Mottola with a pitch and Delgado followed
with a double off the top off the left-field wall to give Toronto a
6-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher's sacrifice fly gave Toronto a 1-0 lead in second.
Rodriguez hit his 34th homer for Seattle in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Mottola, making his first start in the majors since 1996, went
2-for-3, including an RBI single in the sixth that gave Toronto a
7-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Buhner added a solo homer in the Mariners ninth, his 23rd,
off John Frascatore.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Blue Jays, who lead the majors with 221 homers, failed
to homer for the fifth straight game, a season high. ... A fan was
struck in the head by the bat of Seattle's Edgar Martinez in the
fifth inning. She was taken away by the medical staff and appeared
to be OK. ... Attendance was just 17,055.

Clinton Pushes Accord at Summit
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- President Clinton labored today without apparent success to
impress Israeli and Palestinian leaders with a sense of urgency as their
deadline for a settlement loomed only a week away. White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart made no claim of progress after Clinton's back-to-back meetings with
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Clinton
had faced long odds in trying to relaunch his flagging peace process by meeting
with the Mideast leaders on the fringes of the U.N. Millennium Summit.

Appeals Court Sets Hearing for Lee
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- A federal appeals court agreed today to set a
hearing for Wen Ho Lee's lawyers to argue that the accused nuclear scientist
should be released from jail. The Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Appeals Court,
which last week superseded a bail-release order signed by a federal judge in
Albuquerque, set the hearing for Monday in Denver. The hearing will be closed to
the public for security reasons. The defense had petitioned the court to release
the fired Los Alamos scientist, who has been jailed since Dec. 10 while he
awaits trial.

Western Fire Crews Heading Home
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- Firefighters are leaving Montana by the planeload as
officials begin demobilizing from the worst fire season in decades. At least 300
firefighters have returned to their homes in the southeastern and southwestern
United States, and more were expected to head to other fires across the country
by the end of the week. ''The pendulum has now swung the other way,'' said Bill
Cowin, incident commander for a fire camp that has been set up in Missoula to
handle demobilization.

Official: Kursk Crew Died Instantly
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov said Wednesday that there
had never been any contact with the 118 Russian sailors aboard the Kursk nuclear
submarine after it sank Aug. 12, and they were probably all killed instantly.
Navy officials had said several times that they heard tapping from inside the
submarine the first few days after it went down during exercises in the Barents
Sea, indicating some crew members were alive. That encouraged rescuers who spent
a week trying to open the vessel.

French Get Tough With Striking Truckers
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- French truckers stepped up a blockade of the nation's fuel
depots Wednesday as the government said it would make no more concessions and
demanded an end to protests that have forced some gas stations to run dry. Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin took a tough line with the truckers, saying their strike
had ''inflicted a major handicap on the French economy,'' and the government had
reached its limit. France has the second highest fuel prices in the European
Union after Britain.

Legislators Look at Privacy Bills
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Shocked at how simple it is for law enforcement to get
court permission to see the telephone numbers people dial, legislators today
discussed new bills aimed at tightening surveillance laws and put final touches
on a plan to address workplace privacy. The proposed wiretap bill would make it
more difficult for prosecutors to obtain court permission to monitor the
telephone numbers dialed by a suspect. The bill would require the same standard
of evidence now needed for permission to tap a telephone conversation. Two very
similar bills, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act and the Digital Privacy
Act, spawned from citizen concerns about their privacy online.

<HEADLINE> Activist Alleges Wrong Conviction  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- An anti-Vietnam War activist whose criminal past
was uncovered when he ran for a suburban city council pleaded
guilty Wednesday to charges related to his 28-year flight from
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Mechanic, 52, lived in Arizona under the name Gary
Tredway, establishing a career as a successful business owner and
activist whose role in the public sphere ultimately was his
downfall.
</P>
<P>
   After a reporter learned his identity earlier this year,
Mechanic turned himself in on a 1972 conviction for throwing a
cherry bomb during a protest at Washington University in St. Louis.
He began the five-year sentence in February.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Roger Strand tacked on a
concurrent four-month sentence for fleeing authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Upon his Nov. 21 sentencing for falsifying information to obtain
a passport, Mechanic will likely receive three years probation. A
count of falsifying information to obtain a Social Security card
was dropped.
</P>
<P>
   In court, Mechanic spoke of the fear he had as a 22-year-old
man, just two weeks from graduation and apologized to the people of
Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   ''I lied to people...and I regret that,'' Mechanic said. ''I'd
never recommend anybody do what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Mechanic's spokeswoman, Athia Hardt, called the deal favorable
in that it resolved outstanding charges in St. Louis and Arizona.
''Once these are resolved, it will allow Howard's supporters to
seek a commutation of his sentence,'' she said
</P>
<P>
   Mechanic and his supporters have appealed to the Justice
Department and the White House to commute his 1972 conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Joining their cause is St. Louis psychologist Larry Kogan, who
Tuesday admitted to ''Dateline NBC'' and the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch that he stood next to Mechanic that night and did not
see him throw a cherry bomb. Kogan received a 90-day sentence for
his actions and later was pardoned by President Reagan
</P>
<P>
   Kogan admitted he threw a bomb during the same protest. Other
witnesses told authorities they saw both men throw fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the unfortunate thing is that I've never forgiven
myself for doing something so stupid,'' Kogan told Dateline.

<HEADLINE> Notes From Wednesday's Baseball Games  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressAMERICAN LEAGUE:
Devil Rays-Indians:
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: Bench coach Bill Russell managed the team in place of
Larry Rothschild, who began serving a three-game suspension
resulting from last week's fights against Boston. Russell went 2-0
while Rothschild was suspended July 26-27. ... RHP Cory Lidle sat
out the second game of his three-game suspension, while OF Gerald
Williams, (five games), RHP Dave Eiland (three games) and RHP Tony
Fiore (three games) continued to play pending appeals. ... C Mike
DeFelice has hit .130 (9-for-69) since July 13, dropping his
average from .292 to .231. ... Rookie 1B-OF Steve Cox leads the
team in pinch hits, going 7-for-20 (.350) off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: Manager Charlie Manuel said it is unlikely C Sandy
Alomar will get the green light to steal again soon. ''He got his
one, that's it,'' Manuel said with a chuckle. Alomar got his first
stolen base in four years Tuesday night. ... Manuel said he will
meet with pitching coach Dick Pole and RHP Charles Nagy about
Nagy's possible return to the starting rotation. Nagy had elbow
surgery May 19 and is currently on rehab assignment with Triple-A
Buffalo. ''He's had some success against the teams we'll be playing
(Chicago and Boston), but we'll see,'' Manuel said. ... In 38 games
since missing four games July 20-23 with a sore left ankle, 2B
Roberto Alomar hit .336 with seven homers and 19 RBIs. ... The
Indians do not have a stolen base from the designated hitter spot
in the lineup this season.
Mariners-Blue Jays:
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: LF Rickey Henderson entered the game fourth on the
career runs list with 2,170, just four runs behind Babe Ruth and
Hank Aaron, tied for second with 2,174. ... With his 32nd save on
Tuesday night, Kazuhiro Sasaki established a new AL rookie record
for saves. The major league record is held by Todd Worrell, who had
36 with St. Louis in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: Toronto manager Jim Fregosi gave RF Dave Martinez a day
off. Chad Mottola started in his place. Mottola was the
International League's MVP this season after hitting .309 with a
league-leading 33 homers and 102 RBIs, second in the IL. ... 2B
Homer Bush had surgery on his right hip Wednesday to repair fraying
of his cartilage. Bush won't play until spring training next year.
... The Tennessee Smokies and the Blue Jays have agreed to extend
their working relationship for two more seasons. The Smokies are
the only Double-A franchise the Blue Jays have ever had.
Athletics-Red Sox:
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: The A's had to be happy heading home after Wednesday's
game that ended a six-game trip. Going into the game, Oakland was
11-22 on the road since the All-Star break. Before the break, the
A's road record was 24-12. ... Boston's Rolando Arrojo had to face
the batter who ruined his first start with the Red Sox, catcher Sal
Fasano. On July 30 in Oakland, Fasano had a grand slam and a solo
homer as the A's won 5-2 just three days after Arrojo was traded
from Colorado. Arrojo allowed only one other hit in 6 1-3 innings.
Fasano began Wednesday's game batting .203 and singled in his first
at bat. ... When Randy Velarde doubled in two runs in the second
inning, it was the eighth time he reached base in 10 plate
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: 1B Brian Daubach missed his seventh consecutive game
since suffering a hyperextended left elbow Aug. 29 in a brawl with
the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. 3B Lou Merloni, who sustained a
concussion during the fight, played in Boston's next game but has
missed all six since then. ... RHP Rick Croushore, obtained in the
trade that brought Arrojo to Boston, was recalled from Triple-A
Pawtucket. ... SS Nomar Garciaparra, an outstanding fielder, had a
rough first inning. Leadoff hitter Terrence Long hit a hard
grounder at him just to the left of second base. Garciaparra
knocked the ball down, then picked it up, but the speedy Long beat
the throw for a single. Then, with Garciaparra playing to the right
of second base for lefty Jason Giambi, a hard one-hopper was hit
just to his glove side but it skipped by him for another single. In
the third, Garciaparra made a throwing error on Ben Grieve's
grounder.
Orioles-Twins:
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: The Orioles got a bit of a scare when a comebacker
from Twins DH David Ortiz bounced off the forearm of starting
pitcher Sidney Ponson. Both Ponson and manager Mike Hargrove said
Ponson probably will not miss his next turn in the rotation. Ponson
completed the play by throwing out Ortiz, but then was replaced by
reliever B.J. Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: Manager Tom Kelly was particularly happy LF Jacque
Jones had two singles and drove in two runs in Wednesday's 4-1
victory, including the go-ahead RBI on a seventh-inning groundout.
Jones has hit safely in only 13 of his last 22 games and was
hitless in five at-bats during the series going into Wednesday's
game.
Rangers-White Sox:
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: Jonathon Johnson earned his first major league victory in
relief Tuesday night, and manager Johnny Oates said there was no
grand scheme for putting him in the game. ''I just said (Tim)
Crabtree and (Jeff) Zimmerman have worked a lot,'' Oates said. ''It
came down to (Brian Sikorski) and Johnson and I said let's give him
a chance.'' ... Oates will be looking at his young players in the
next few weeks, and he'd like to see them have some success. ''No
one likes to fail all the time,'' he said. ''Success breeds
success. The more success you have, the better you think of
yourself, the more confident you are.'' ... Ruben Sierra made his
first start since 1998 on Wednesday night. The veteran outfielder
was recalled by the Rangers before Tuesday's game. ... The Rangers'
2-1 victory Tuesday night was their third straight. It's only the
second time in the last 54 games they've won three or more in a
row. ... The Rangers are 5-3 against the White Sox this year, one
of only two teams with a winning record against Chicago. The Kansas
City Royals are 6-3 against the White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: Despite having the best record in the majors, the White
Sox still aren't drawing fans. ... Greg Norton, called up from
Triple-A Charlotte on Tuesday, started at third Wednesday night in
place of Herbert Perry. ''Herbert's feeling a little fatigued,''
Manuel said. ... With the Indians cutting into Chicago's lead in
the AL Central, the weekend series at Cleveland takes on more
significance. ''This weekend is going to be a big weekend in
baseball,'' Manuel said. ''To go in and play a team that's chasing
us, it's going to be exciting.''
Angels-Tigers:
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: RHP Tim Belcher never liked pitching in Tiger Stadium.
The former Tiger will get his first start in Comerica Park when he
replaces the injured Kent Mercker for Thursday's series finale. ...
1B Mo Vaughn was 1-for-9 with six strikeouts (including four
Tuesday) in the first two games of the series at Detroit. Vaughn
entered Wednesday with an AL-leading 152 strikeouts. ... Darin
Erstad returned to the outfield Tuesday for the first time since he
missed four games with muscle spasms in his left rib cage. Erstad
was the DH in his last 10 games. ... Tuesday's 7-5 loss at Detroit
left the Angels 36-36 in games decided by two runs or fewer.
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: 1B Tony Clark was out of the lineup Wednesday for the
first time since he returned from the DL (lumbar spine strain) last
week. Manager Phil Garner said the switch-hitting Clark isn't
swinging well right-handed, so he sat against Angels LHP Scott
Schoeneweis. ... OF Juan Gonzalez missed his second straight game
with what Garner called ''a slight case of the flu'' and is
day-to-day. ... RHP Dave Mlicki makes his first start since July 22
in Thursday's series finale against Anaheim. Mlicki (4-10, 5.61)
has out with a severe sinus infection that required surgery. ...
Bench coach Bob Melvin is hospitalized with a viral infection in
his middle ear. ''It's like having shingles in your ear,'' Garner
said. ''There's a good chance he'll be out (of the hospital)
tomorrow and then he'll be a few days away from joining us.
Yankees-Royals:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: Yankees RHP David Cone will miss his scheduled start
on Sunday after separating his left shoulder in the third inning of
Tuesday's 10-5 win over Kansas City. An MRI exam on Wednesday
revealed minimal bruising, Cone said. Manager Joe Torre said he
will announce Sunday's starter on Thursday. ... New York 2B Chuck
Knoblauch started Wednesday's game, his first appearance since
coming off the DL on Friday. He had been sidelined since Aug. 3
with tendinitis in his right elbow. ... Yankees RHP Orlando
Hernandez was making his first start of the season against the
Royals.
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: Kansas City's Johnny Damon was one sacrifice fly
short of the team single-season record of 13, set by Darrell Porter
in 1979 and matched by Dean Palmer in 1998. ... The Royals' Mike
Sweeney had a career-high 126 RBIs going into Wednesday's game. He
needed seven more to tie Hal McRae's club record, set in 1982.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Expos-Cardinals:
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: The Expos recalled 1B-OF Talmadge Noonan from Triple-A
Ottawa. ... Jose Vidro, with 87 RBIs is bidding to join Vladimir
Guerrero as the only two Expos to ever drive in 100 runs in a
single season.
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: The sixth-through-eighth place hitters have batted
.370 (47-127) with 29 RBIs in the last 12 games before Wednesday's
action. ... The bottom three position players drove in six runs
Tuesday night and all four runs that were scored Monday. ... The
Cardinals, with one game left on the homestand, did not activate
Mark McGwire from the DL. The Cardinals said they hoped to activate
McGwire for use as a pinch hitter before their next road trip.
Mets-Reds:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: The Mets have 24 homers in their past 21 games. ...
New York is just 1-5 in September. ... When Bobby M. Jones relieved
Bobby J. Jones, it was the first time in Mets history that pitchers
with the same first and last names followed each other.
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: Scott Williamson is expected to come off the DL
(lower back strain) on Friday and start for the Reds at Pittsburgh.
... A wild pitch by Rob Bell in the second raised the Reds' club
record and major league leading total to 86. ... Osvaldo Fernandez
made his first relief appearance since 1996 when he pitched
two-thirds of an inning for Cincinnati. He last pitched July 6 at
St. Louis, went on the DL the next day with a sore elbow, then was
activated Friday.
Marlins-Astros:
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: Marlins manager John Bole missed Wednesday night's
game, going to Chicago to be with his ailing father. 3B coach Fredi
Gonzalez managed the team in Boles' absence. ... Luis Castillo
leads the majors with a career high 54 stolen bases.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: Tim Bogar was hitting .140 when he was a starter at
shortstop the first six weeks of the season. Bogar regained the
starting job in August after the Astros had to shuffle infield
players due to Craig Biggio's season-ending knee injury and Bogar
responded by hitting .295 with two homers and 10 RBI in August. He
is hitting .306 in his past 23 starts. ... Astros starting pitchers
have taken the decision in each of the last 12 games, including two
complete games by Chris Holt and Wade Miller, and have a 6-6 record
in that span.
Cubs-Rockies:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: Rick Aguilera got his 29th save Wednesday and is a save
away from his seventh, 30-save season. ... Sammy Sosa hit his 382nd
home run, his 252nd with the Cubs; he has more home runs in the
past five seasons (251) than anyone else in the majors except Mark
McGwire (275). ... Mark Grace struck out for only the 26th time
this year. ... Eric Young's two steals gives him 47 for the year.
Young has been successful on 21 consecutive stolen base attempts
and hasn't been caught stealing since July 2 against Milwaukee. ...
The win helped Chicago avoid an 0-6 on the road trip and matching
its longest losing streak of the year, a seven-game skid from Aug.
15-22.
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: X-rays on Pedro Astacio's right hand were negative.
Astacio was hit on the base of his thumb by a line drive off the
bat of Eric Young on the first pitch of the game. ... Larry Walker
was scheduled for arthroscopic surgery on Thursday at Vail, Colo.,
to remove a bone spur and other debris from his right. ... C Brent
Mayne made his first start since Aug. 28. ... The Rockies won the
season series from the Cubs 5-4. Colorado holds a 4-3-1 season
series edge in the eight years of the franchise. ... Left-handed
batters are hitting .139 (11-for-80) against reliever Mike Myers.
... Todd Walker was hitless in six at-bats after going 6-for-7 with
two triples, two home runs and seven RBIs in the first two games of
the series. ... Todd Helton tied a career high by striking out
three times in an 0-for-5 game.
Diamondbacks-Braves:
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: Entering Wednesday, LF Luis Gonzalez h driven in seven
of the Diamondbacks' 14 runs against Atlanta this season. He went
0-for-2 Tuesday with a sacrifice fly but still owned a .385 average
(5-for-13) against the Braves. ... RHP Curt Schilling, who starts
for Arizona on Thursday, has lost his last three starts. Against
the Braves, though, Schilling is 3-0 in four starts with a 1.16 ERA
and two shutouts. ... The Diamondbacks are 1-51 when trailing after
eight innings. ... Despite losing 5-2 Tuesday night, LHP Randy
Johnson struck out 11 to move within one strikeout of his fourth
straight 300-K season. Johnson needs eight to become the 12th
pitcher with 3,000 in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: The Braves called up RHP Chris Seelbach, who went 5-7
with a 5.89 ERA at Triple-A Richmond. He made 22 starts and
appeared in seven other games, converting both of his save
opportunities. ... LHP Derrin Ebert was designated for assignment.
... 3B Chipper Jones, who hit two homers against Johnson Tuesday,
has three career two-homer games against left-handers. He did it
Aug. 20 against Kirk Rueter and Sept. 5, 1999 against Johnson. ...
John Rocker's 19th save Tuesday was the bullpen's 48th this year.
The franchise record for saves is 51.
Phillies-Giants:
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: The Phillies were a season-worst 25 games under
.500 entering play on Wednesday, 24&AMP;frac12; games behind Atlanta. ... OF
Pat Burrell hit his 14th homer of the season on Tuesday night,
which snapped a 78 at-bat homerless streak dating to Aug. 8. ... 1B
Doug Glanville singled home a run in the fourth on Tuesday, which
snapped an 0-for-33 streak for the team with runners in scoring
position.
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: RHP Russ Ortiz was selected NL pitcher of the
month for August after winning all six of his decisions with an ERA
of 1.12 in 40 1-3 innings. ''Beautiful. That's awesome,'' Giants
manager Dusty Baker said. ''That's a tremendous achievement,
especially in a month where we really needed it. August set up
September. We won 19 games and he won a third of them. That's a
heck of a month.'' ... OF Armando Rios, who has missed the last
five games with bruises on his left elbow and left knee, was
available for spot duty on Wednesday. Baker said he plans to start
Rios on Saturday to give OF Ellis Burks a day off. ... RHP Robb
Nen, who saved the past three games, wasn't available on Wednesday.
... Baker indicated he was going to try to get C Scott Servais and
OF Terrell Lowery into a game as soon as possible. They are the
only two September callups who have yet to appear.
Pirates-Dodgers:
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: Former Pirates 3B Richie Hebner, who took over as
manager at Triple-A Nashville in June when Trent Jewett replaced
Jack Lind as Pirates 3B coach, will join the Bucs for the rest of
the season beginning Friday. ... INF Mike Benjamin will have an MRI
Friday in Pittsburgh on his sore lower back, which has kept him
sidelined for 16 games. He was injured Aug. 20 at Cincinnati while
backhanding a grounder and straightening up to make the throw to
first base. ... The Pirates carried an errorless streak of 57
consecutive innings into Wednesday night's game -- their longest
streak of the season.
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: LHP Carlos Perez, 1-6 with a 6.43 ERA in his last
15 starts, will miss the rest of the season and will probably
undergo shoulder surgery next Thursday. An MRI and CAT scan
detected a bone spur that had broken loose from the back of the
shoulder capsule. Perez won't be able to throw for 2-3 months,
according to Dr. Frank Jobe, but should be ready for the start of
spring training. ... RHP Luke Prokopec, who made his major league
debut Monday night and mopped up with three scoreless innings in a
12-1 loss, is penciled in to start next Tuesday at Arizona in place
of Perez. Prokopec had planned on pitching for his native Australia
in the Olympics before he was promoted from Double-A San Antonio on
Sept. 1.
Brewers-Padres:
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: The Brewers would have to win 14 of their final 23
games under rookie manager Davey Lopes just to equal last season's
record of 74-87. ... It's no wonder the Brewers look forward to the
starts of RHP Jeff D'Amico, the majors' hottest starter the last
two months. D'Amico, Friday's starter against St. Louis, is 9-1
with 1.95 ERA in 12 starts since coming off the DL on July 1. The
Brewers are 13-5 when D'Amico starts.
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: Rookie RHP Adam Eaton will skip his next scheduled
start on Friday at San Francisco and be replaced by RHP Will
Cunnane. The Padres are being cautious with Eaton, who has
experienced arm problems in his last two outings. Eaton, 5-2 with a
3.58 ERA, has combined to throw more innings (170) this season --
113 with the Padres and 57 at Double-A Mobile -- than any other in
his previous three professional seasons. ... 3B Phil Nevin is
unhappy that the Padres (67-72) are in a position where reaching
.500 mark has become a primary goal. ''To be honest, it (stinks) to
have a goal to finish .500,'' Nevin said. ''But where we're at and
where we were at the middle of May, it would be pretty good to
finish .500. I just think we're much better than a last-place
team.''

<HEADLINE> NYC activist's body identified in Indonesia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - The body of a Queens-based lawyer and activist
was identified Wednesday among five corpses found in Indonesia,
where he had campaigned for peace in his violence-ridden home
province, activists said.
</P>
<P>
   Jafar Siddiq Hamzah, 35, was definitively identified by an
autopsy in which doctors found evidence of a colon operation he
underwent in New York in 1998, said Sidney Jones, Asia director for
Human Rights Watch.
</P>
<P>
   Hamzah's family, who live on the Indonesian island of Sumatra,
had said earlier that they did not recognize him among five badly
decomposed bodies found in a ravine about 40 miles southwest of the
North Sumatran capital of Medan.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors were uncertain whether Hamzah, 35, was stabbed or shot,
Jones said. His body was expected to be released to his family on
Thursday, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Hamzah moved to New York several years ago and founded the
International Forum on Aceh to campaign for peace in Aceh, a
province on the northern tip of Sumatra where government troops
have been battling separatist rebels for the past 25 years. He was
a native of Aceh and had worked on human rights issues there since
the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Hamzah actively campaigned against Indonesian military violence
and had reported receiving death threats in the days before his
disappearance. He was last seen Aug. 5 in Medan, Indonesia's
third-largest city.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said his death fit a long-standing pattern of military
abuse connected to the conflict in Aceh. Four other Aceh activists
have been found dead this year, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The thing there's still an element of uncertainty about is who
did it,'' she said. ''Is this something that's being directed by a
central authority? Is it some unit of the military that's just
decided to take things into its own hands? There's even a slight
possibility that it's a faction of the guerrilla movement. We just
don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Activists have called for a full, civilian investigation of the
deaths.

<HEADLINE> BC-NY--UN Summit-Protests, 1st Ld-Writethru,590  </HEADLINE>
By LUKAS I. ALPERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP)- Honking horns mingled with voices of political
protest outside the walls of the United Nations on New York's
gridlocked streets Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   As the Millennium Summit began, demonstrators had their say on
everything from Middle East peace and slavery in Sudan to Cuban
leader Fidel Castro's presence and China's human rights policies.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, shopowners cooled their heels behind police barricades,
cut off from customers by tight security measures.
</P>
<P>
   ''You lose some business, but on the other hand you pick up with
the foreigners coming in to buy converters and adapters,'' said Bob
Kramer, co-owner of Kramer's Hardware, which was frequently blocked
by motorcades passing along Second Avenue and 49th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two protests were officially registered with police
Wednesday, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Falun Gong practitioners from around the world
gathered in the morning at a park opposite the Chinese Mission to
protest a crackdown on the movement's followers that began last
year in China.
</P>
<P>
   After sitting, stock still, in silent meditative protest, and
listening to statements read by practitioners who said they had
been detained and beaten in China for practicing Falun Gong, the
group rose in unison and marched in orderly rows the 12 blocks to
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong has attracted millions of followers with its
philosophy of exercise, meditation and beliefs drawn from Buddhism,
Taoism and the unorthodox ideas of its founder Li Hongzhi. While
followers say Falun Gong promotes health and morality, China's
government has banned it as a cult.
</P>
<P>
   ''We practice three principles - truth, compassion, and
forbearance,'' said Dong Li, a computer programmer from Mamaroneck,
who has practiced Falun Gong for a year. ''This apparently is not
concordant with Communist doctrine,''
</P>
<P>
   ''We really hope that (Chinese President) Jiang Zemin will stop
persecuting people who want to do this. We have no other intentions
than peaceful ones,'' Dong said.
</P>
<P>
   The march brought the Falun Gong protesters past the Sudanese
Mission on Third Avenue, where a group of 60 protesters demanded
the arrest of Sudanese President Omar el-Bashir. Two of the
protesters, former slaves from Sudan and Mauritania, said the
United States is doing nothing to stop enslavement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why should the president of a slaving nation be allowed to
walk free on the streets of New York?'' asked Charles Jacobs,
president of the American Anti-Slavery Group, a Boston-based
organization that tries to raise awareness of forced labor around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Upon arriving at the United Nations, Falun Gong followers
silently hunkered down into the lotus position and began
meditating, while raucous neighbors nearby on Dag Hammerskjold
Plaza protested Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Later, they were all replaced by a new shift of demonstrators -
Iranians, sandwiched between Bangladeshis and anti-Castro Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is an insult to the free world that this man (Castro) is
here while the Dalai Lama was not allowed to attend,'' said Yvonne
Conde, a Cuban-American writer who lives in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Later, about a dozen sympathizers of the Iranian National
Council of Resistance, a Paris-based group that considers itself
Iran's government in exile, sat in the middle of First Avenue near
the U.N., screaming that Iranian President Mohammad Khatami is a
terrorist. Police arrived shortly and arrested them.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - It took three other photographers, 200
selected escorts and a crash course in diplomacy, but Terry Deglau
says he caught the United Nations Millennium moment.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. hired Deglau, who is Eastman Kodak Co.'s manager of
photographic trade relations, to direct the official summit photo
shoot Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Deglau's work began well before Wednesday. He had to take
political considerations under advisement in deciding where each
official would stand.
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't much room. The U.N. vetoed an outdoor shot for
security reasons so Deglau had to settle on the U.N.'s trustees'
room, which was too small for all the leaders' entourages.
</P>
<P>
   So he had to work with UN officials to arrange an escort for
each official - one who spoke the native language of the dignitary.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining Kodak 15 years ago, Deglau ran his own portrait
studio in Latrobe, Pa. for 25 years and was Arnold Palmer's
photographer for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The shoot is great publicity for Kodak, Deglau said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a big deal.''

<HEADLINE> Athletics 6, Red Sox 4  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD ULMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Mike Mulder, struggling through a tough rookie
season, pitched six strong innings and slumping Matt Stairs homered
as the Oakland Athletics beat the Boston Red Sox 6-4 Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland won for the fourth time in five games and moved 1&AMP;frac12; games
behind AL West leader Seattle, which lost to Toronto 7-3.
</P>
<P>
   The A's and Red Sox trail AL wild card leader Cleveland by three
games.
</P>
<P>
   Mulder (8-10) was 2-8 in his previous 11 starts and entered the
night with opponents hitting .318 against him, the highest in the
AL.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, he gave up just two runs on five hits and left
with a 4-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Stairs was at the opposite extreme. The .220 average he took
into the game was the lowest in the majors among regulars. He
followed Oakland's three-run second inning by hitting Rolando
Arrojo's first pitch of the third for his 20th homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Piatt's RBI single off Rod Beck gave Oakland a 5-2 lead in
the eighth before Boston scored twice in the bottom of the inning
on Dante Bichette's RBI single and Troy O'Leary's grounder. But
Doug Jones struck out Jason Varitek, ending the rally, and Stairs
hit a sacrifice for Oakland in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Mecir pitched the last two innings for his fifth save in 11
chances.
</P>
<P>
   Mulder allowed two singles in the first three innings, then gave
up solo homers to Bichette in the fourth and Jose Offerman in the
sixth. Bichette's first homer since being traded from Cincinnati on
Aug. 31 made it 4-1, while Offerman's sixth of the year cut the
lead to 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   Arrojo (4-2) lasted three innings, his shortest outing in eight
starts since being traded by Colorado on July 27.
</P>
<P>
   He got out of the first without allowing a run despite giving up
two singles. In the second, he allowed three runs on four hits.
Singles by Piatt and Sal Fasano put runners at first and third with
two outs. Terrence Long then singled in one run and Randy Velarde
doubled in two.
</P>
<P>
   Varitek nearly tied the game at 4 with a homer after O'Leary
started the seventh with a single. But center fielder Long reached
over the fence in front of Boston's bullpen to make the catch. Then
Brian Daubach struck out as the first of four pinch-hitters in the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   The next one, Midre Cummings, walked. Lefty Trot Nixon then was
announced as a hitter for Darren Lewis, lefty Mike Magnante came in
to pitch and righty Bernard Gilkey batted for Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   All those maneuvers failed as Gilkey hit the first pitch back to
Magnante for the inning-ending out.
Notes: The Red Sox recalled RHP Rick Croushore from Triple-A
Pawtucket. ... The A's have 11 homers in the last five games. ...
Arrojo was 4-0 in his previous five starts and pitched well in his
first loss with the Red Sox when he gave up three hits in Oakland's
5-2 win July 30. Two of them were homers by Fasano, including a
grand slam. ... Mulder entered the game as one of the AL's worst
starters, ranking first in most hits and runners allowed per nine
innings and in highest batting average allowed. ... Boston
relievers Rheal Cormier and Tim Wakefield followed Arrojo with four
hitless innings.

<HEADLINE> Braves 7, Diamondbacks 1  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE HENRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Chipper Jones had two run-scoring singles and
Kevin Millwood gave up four hits in eight innings to lead the
Atlanta Braves past the slumping Arizona Diamondbacks 7-1 Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, which has won three of four, increased their NL East
lead to two games over the second-place New York Mets, who lost
11-8 at Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona, which entered Wednesday six games behind NL
West-leading San Francisco, has lost four of five. Armando Reynoso
(10-10) lost his third straight start and dropped to 0-9 against
the Braves, giving up three runs and four hits in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 25,529 was the smallest at Turner Field, which
opened in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching in a cold drizzle, Millwood (9-10) retired 14 straight
after giving up a leadoff double to Greg Colbrunn in the fourth.
The Diamondbacks finally got a runner on Tony Womack's double in
the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood benefited from a great play by Rafael Furcal that ended
the inning. The pitcher was knocked down by Jay Bell's liner, but
the ball deflected to Furcal at shortstop and he threw to first.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood, who won for only the second time in seven starts since
Aug. 1, struck out seven and walked none in his longest outing of
the season. Terry Mulholland finished with a hitless ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Colbrunn doubled in Tony Womack with two outs in the first, but
Atlanta tied it in the fourth when B.J. Surhoff singled home a run
after fouling off five pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta took a 3-1 lead n the sixth. Furcal led off with a
double and was nearly thrown out trying to dive back to second when
third baseman Matt Williams fielded Andruw Jones' grounder.
Second-base umpire Eric Cooper, though, ruled that Furcal beat
Bell's tag.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones doubled in Furcal, moving Andruw Jones to third
and Andres Galarraga followed with a run-scoring, double-play
grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Andruw Jones and Chipper Jones hit RBI singles off off
Byung-Hyun Kim in a four-run eighth that included a run-scoring
grounder by Galarraga off Mike Morgan and Javy Lopez's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Millwood won his ninth game last year on June 28 after
making his 16th start. He finished the season 18-7. ... Millwood
made his 31st start Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Colombia President Sees Cease-Fire  </HEADLINE>
By PAISLEY DODDS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Vowing to give Colombia a second chance at
peace, President Andres Pastrana said Wednesday he's optimistic
about sealing a cease-fire deal with leftist rebels who have all
but paralyzed the South American nation.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Pastrana said that in
the next two weeks the government will meet with leaders of the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, the country's
largest guerrilla insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   Refusing to divulge when a cease-fire deal could happen, or what
either side was bringing to the negotiating table, Pastrana would
only say that he thought FARC leader Manuel Marulanda was serious
about ending a drug war that has crippled the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Under the banner ''Plan Colombia,'' Pastrana hopes to squash
drug traffickers and bring justice back to the country -- goals that
the United States says it will help accomplish by contributing $1.3
billion in aid. Neither American nor any other foreign troops,
however, will take part in combat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that he (Marulanda) is willing to go forward with
peace, but people are expecting fast results in a process that is
very difficult,'' Pastrana said in an interview at his hotel
shortly after his address at the U.N. Millennium Summit.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course, I'm optimistic that negotiations will advance. Can
you imagine what it would be like if I was a pessimist?''
</P>
<P>
   FARC attacks have continued despite talks that Pastrana began in
January 1999. Just last week, a surge of rebel violence left 35
people dead, including seven police officers slain by guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   He said some progress had been made with the rebels in
discussions about lessening the impact of the drug war. In the end,
coca farmers and the guerrillas who make money by protecting them
will lose their incomes.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana also said his fight was not just against violence and
drugs, but to make sure the poor benefitted from the spoils of
globalization.

   ''Only a portion of our plan to stop these narcotraffickers is
about military action,'' he said. ''The other part of the plan is
developing alternative crops and finding a way to strengthen human

<HEADLINE> Dodgers' Perez Out for Season  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Carlos Perez, who heard derisive cheering by
Los Angeles Dodgers fans when he left Tuesday night's game with an
injured left shoulder, is done for the season and is expected to
undergo arthroscopic surgery next week.
</P>
<P>
   An MRI and CAT scan on Wednesday detected a bone spur that had
broken loose from the back of the shoulder capsule. Perez won't be
able to throw for 2-3 months, but should be ready for the start of
spring training, according to team physician Dr. Frank Jobe.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that it was bothering him before last night, and he
was hiding it, didn't make matters any easier,'' manager Davey
Johnson said Wednesday. ''But he's a tough guy. He's going to want
to go out there and pitch. He never goes for treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez, 1-6 with a 6.43 ERA in his last 15 starts, has been a
lightening rod this season for frustrated Dodgers fans who expected
more from a team with an $88 million, opening-day payroll. Perez is
owed $7.5 million next season, the final year of a three-year deal
worth $15.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   When he left the mound after throwing his 96th pitch to
Pittsburgh's Brian Giles, Perez had gone only 3 2-3 innings and
would eventually be charged with six runs and 10 hits. Overall, he
is 5-8 with a 5.56 ERA and 25 home runs allowed.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Gov. Signs Power Legislation  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT LINDLAW
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Legislation meant to ease the burden
of power rate spikes in Southern California and help avert future
energy shortages in the state were signed into law Wednesday by
Gov. Gray Davis.
</P>
<P>
   One measure spreads energy price increases over several years,
and the other speeds the approval process for new power plants.
Davis deferred action on a third, politically delicate bill, which
would use taxpayer money to defray the costs of rate increases in
excess of 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not the last step we have to take to solve this
problem, but it's a very important first step,'' the Democrat said.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents said the governor was approving merely a stop-gap
solution for the state's energy crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a quick political fix that puts on layaway today's high
energy costs until 2003 or 2004,'' said Doug Kline, a spokesman for
San Diego Gas and Electric. ''The law is designed to get the
politicians past the next election.''
</P>
<P>
   Both measures would take effect immediately if they receive
endorsement from the Public Utilities Commission, which meets
Thursday, the governor's office said.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego residents have seen their electric bills soar since
rates were deregulated in June. Deregulation was meant to lower
prices, but demand for electricity has outstripped supply because
of a growing population, a booming high-tech economy, and less
power available from neighboring states that haven't deregulated.
</P>
<P>
   The utility commission last month cut rates for most San Diego
residents by 43 percent in response to outcry over rising prices.
</P>
<P>
   Under the first measure, rates for residential users would be
capped at 6.5 cents per kilowatt hour, dropping the average monthly
residential utility bill from $120 to $68. Customers would receive
rebates for energy use for which they were charged more than 6.5
cents per kilowatt hour after June 1.
</P>
<P>
   The measure seeks to avert causing San Diego Gas and Electric
losses, but the company said customers would face rate hikes in
2003 or 2004 to make up for projected losses of $839 million
stemming from the new law.

<HEADLINE> Wizards 1, Revolution 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Miklos Molnar's goal five minutes into the
second half gave the Kansas City Wizards a 1-0 victory over the New
England Revolution on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the defeat, New England was assured a playoff berth when
Columbus lost 3-1 to Chicago later Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City goalkeeper Tony Meola recorded his 16th shutout of
the season, adding to his own league record.
</P>
<P>
   Meola secured the victory with a minute left, making a kick-save
to block Mauricio Wright's header off a free kick by John Harkes.
Meola made two other late saves. A diving header by Beasley off
Wolde Harris' cross forced Meola to reach for the save in the 77th
minute. The goalkeeper punched away William Sunsing's 16-yard shot
three minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution (12-13-6) didn't get its first shot on goal until
the 57th minute, when substitute Jamar Beasley forced Meola to make
a save near the left post.
</P>
<P>
   The game's lone goal came when Francisco Gomez slid a pass on
the left side to Chris Henderson, who made a run toward the New
England area before passing to Molnar. The Dane shot the ball in
from 2 yards away, near the right post.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson had hit the crossbar with a shot early in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City improved to an MLS-best 16-7-8.

<HEADLINE> Man hits his lawyer in court  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - A lawyer was injured Wednesday when his
client punched him during a probation violation hearing in Monroe
County Court, deputies said.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Public Defender David A. Duguay was cut in his chin
while trying to calm Douglas Tabon after Tabon threw a pen at a
witness during a probation violation hearing, court deputies said.
</P>
<P>
   Tabon, 22, a patient at Rochester Psychiatric Center, wasn't
charged because Duguay refused to press charges. Duguay couldn't be
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Tabon was sentenced to five years probation July 7 after
pleading guilty to possessing a forged check.
</P>
<P>
   He allegedly violated probation three days after his sentencing
by punching an aide at the psychiatric center.
</P>
<P>
   A center employee was testifying when Tabon, who is in a
wheelchair, threw a pen at the witness, then rose partly from his
wheelchair and hit Duguay, deputies said.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The CEO of Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. apologized today
before angry members of Congress for dozens of fatal accidents that may be
linked to his company's tires. The chief executive of Ford Motor Co. insisted
his company could not be blamed but promised to notify Americans from now on
when problems occur overseas. At the same time, internal Bridgestone/Firestone
documents obtained by The Associated Press showed the company had data
indicating safety problems years before the Aug. 9 recall of 6.5 million tires.

charges related to his 28-year flight from authorities. Howard Mechanic, 52,
lived in Arizona under the name Gary Tredway, establishing a career as a
successful business owner and activist whose role in the public sphere
ultimately was his downfall. After a reporter learned his identity earlier this

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Shocked at how simple it is for law enforcement to get

on a plan to address workplace privacy. The proposed wiretap bill would make it
more difficult for prosecutors to obtain court permission to monitor the
telephone numbers dialed by a suspect. The bill would require the same standard
of evidence now needed for permission to tap a telephone conversation. Two very
similar bills, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act and the Digital Privacy
Act, spawned from citizen concerns about their privacy online.

<HEADLINE> UN Workers Evacuated From West Timor  </HEADLINE>
By HEATHER PATERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   DILI, East Timor (AP) -- Thousands of armed militiamen and their
supporters rampaged through a U.N. office in West Timor, killing at
least three workers -- including one from Puerto Rico -- and burning
their bodies. The brutal attack brought new pressure against
Indonesia's president as he gathered with world leaders at the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Four U.N. helicopters swooped down to the border town of Atambua
and safely evacuated 54 people to East Timor, but world leaders
quickly and harshly castigated Indonesia for not doing more to
protect aid workers. Witnesses said Indonesian security forces
stood by as the mobs torched the U.N. office and beat the workers.
</P>
<P>
   The unprecedented violence -- one U.N. official said it was one
of the worst attacks on U.N. personnel anywhere in the world -- cast
a shadow over the U.N. Millennium Summit, which opened Wednesday in
New York. More than 150 leaders, including Indonesian President
Abdurrahman Wahid, stood for a moment of silence in honor of the
victims, who were from the U.N. High Commission for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said he was ''deeply saddened'' to hear of the
deaths. ''I urge the Indonesian authorities to put a stop to these
abuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he had taken up the killings
with the Indonesian government ''at the highest level.''
</P>
<P>
   The militias and their military sponsors have been blamed by the
United Nations and Wahid's government of carrying out the bloody
destruction of East Timor a year ago after its people voted to
break free of Indonesian rule in a U.N.-supervised referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia still controls the western part of the island, where
the U.N. refugee agency has been delivering aid to an estimated
90,000 refugees who remain in border in camps after fleeing the
violence in East Timor 12 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The rampage in the border town of Atambua was apparently
triggered by the killing Tuesday of a militiaman opposed to East
Timor's independence. Witnesses said some in the crowd accused the
United Nations of not paying attention to their plight.
</P>
<P>
   One of the dead U.N. workers -- Puerto Rican Carlos Caceres --
sent a desperate e-mail to a U.N. security office six hours before
the massacre warning that they had heard a mob was en route to
destroy the office.
</P>
<P>
   ''You should see this office ... Plywood on the windows, staff
peering out through the openings in the curtains hastily installed
a few minutes ago. We are waiting for the enemy,'' Caceres wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ''These guys act without thinking and can kill a human being as
easily (and painlessly) as I kill mosquitos in my room.''
</P>
<P>
   Caceres added that he was due to start a three-week trip on
Thursday - ''I just hope I will be able to leave tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the staff managed to escape over the back wall, but
three apparently did not make it, a U.N. statement said.
</P>
<P>
   A Security Council statement said the UNHCR had received advance
warning of possible trouble but was assured by the Indonesian
security forces that agency staff would be protected.
</P>
<P>
   The violence threw into question repeated promises by Wahid to
rein in the anti-independence militias or to control sections of
the Indonesian army accused of arming and training them. It may
result in calls for the convening of an international war crimes
tribunal to try Indonesians accused of crimes against humanity in
Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid's office later issued a statement expressing his
condolences to the families of the victims and vowing to ''find the
culprit.'' The statement said troops and police were being sent to
Atambua to help.
</P>
<P>
   The ''mishap,'' Wahid's statement read, ''was triggered by the
uncontrollable emotional distress of the people'' over the killing
of Olivia Mendoza Moruk.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesian officials are already working with East Timor's U.N.
administrator Sergio Vieira de Mello, the statement said. ''One of
the plans is to evacuate these problems-creating people to other
places in Indonesia.''
</P>
<P>
   De Mello said the rampage was one of the worst attacks on U.N.
personnel ever, and described the militias as an out-of-control
''monster'' created by sections of the Indonesian military.
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian army Col. Brynar Nymo said four helicopters from the
East Timor town of Suai flew to Atambua to pick up survivors with
the permission of Indonesian authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the three dead, several foreign staffers for the
U.N. refugee agency escaped and three were injured, one of them
seriously, police in Atambua said.
</P>
<P>
   The seriously injured staffer was a Brazilian woman who was
hacked by an ax-wielding attacker. The three dead workers were
identified as Caceres, Samson Aregahegn of Ethiopia and Pero
Simundza of Croatia. Their hometowns were not immediately
available.
</P>
<P>
   The three were the first civilian workers to be killed in Timor.
Two peacekeeping soldiers have died in border skirmishes with armed
militia infiltrators in East Timor in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''The militiamen beat them to death inside the building. They
then dragged the bodies outside, put on them a pile of wood, poured
gasoline over them and set them on fire,'' said one witness, who
was too frightened to give his name.
</P>
<P>
   About 250,000 East Timorese fled East Timor for dozens of border
refugee camps in West Timor a year ago after last year's
independence ballot. The militia backlash triggered by the east's
independence vote continued until international peacekeepers landed
in East Timor on Sept. 20. Since then, nearly 170,000 refugees have
returned from West Timor.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining refugees, many of them former Indonesian soldiers,
civil servants or militiamen and their families, continue to live
in the camps. The U.N. aid operation has repeatedly been forced to
shut down after attacks by militia gangs on its staff and buildings
in past months.
</P>
<P>
   In an announcement on British Broadcasting Corp. radion
Thursday, the British government recommended that all British
nationals leave West Timor immediately, due to the deteriorating
security situation.

<HEADLINE> Outside UN Summit, baby stands against slavery with Sudanese mother </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - One small, silent face spoke louder than the
competing lineup of noisy protests near the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Majak Bak, a 14-month-old boy, stood outside the Sudanese
Mission on Wednesday with his young mother, who says she was a
slave herding goats in Sudan when her master tried to rape her
three years ago. She escaped, to her new life in Buffalo, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   When Abuk Bak was 12, she says, Muslim horsemen galloped into
her Catholic village, ''burned our houses, and killed many people -
including my grandfather, right there in front of my eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   It was 1987 - the beginning of her decade of slavery, says Bak.
</P>
<P>
   As the U.N. Millennium Summit began, about 60 protesters outside
the mission on Third Avenue demanded the arrest of Sudanese
President Omar el-Bashir for allegedly directing his forces to
create slaves. As many as 100,000 Sudanese are kept in slavery,
according to Charles Jacobs, president of the Boston-based American
Anti-Slavery Group, which organized the protest.
</P>
<P>
   Through a translator, Bak said in Arabic: ''I am dismayed to
learn that el-Bashir is walking the streets of New York City, a
great city of freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sudanese government has repeatedly denied it engages in
slavery, though el-Bashir said in January that he would continue to
fight a ''holy war'' on behalf of Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Bak, now 25, offered her years of bloodied memories as a member
of Sudan's Dinka tribe ''on behalf of those who were not lucky
enough to escape,'' she says. ''Some have been killed. Others
suffer in silence. ... They believe that no one loves them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the raid on Achuru, her village in southern Sudan, she said,
many men were fatally shot, including her grandfather and male
cousins. The attacking Muslim militiamen sold the women and
children into slavery as domestics and shepherds, Jacobs says, and
many of the women were genitally mutilated.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated from her relatives, Bak says, ''I was like an animal,''
with her nomadic master ordering her whipped or stoned if she lost
one of his goats in the Sudanese countryside.
</P>
<P>
   ''I escaped one night after he tried to rape me,'' she told The
Associated Press. ''I resisted, and he cut my leg with a knife. I
slipped away, got on a goat truck and hid among the animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, she ended up in the Sudanese capital Khartoum and
met a fellow Dinka named Majak. In 1998, he arranged for her to
marry his brother in Cairo. Bak was resettled in America by the
United Nations six months ago with her husband, now a 27-year-old
metalworker in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Their son Majak is named after the man who saved her - now her
brother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday afternoon, the young mother stepped into St.
Patrick's Cathedral on Fifth Avenue with her child. As he sucked on
the milk from his baby bottle, the boy's eyes lit up at the
brightly illuminated stained glass.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm happy, because he is free,'' his mother said in broken
English.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs says the United States and other Western nations are
doing little to stop the abuse in Sudan and Mauritania, where he
says as many as 1 million people are enslaved, including Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   ''Slavery is the stepchild of the human rights movement,'' says
Jacobs, who quit his work as an international management consultant
with a Ph.D. in education from Harvard to form the anti-slavery
group.
</P>
<P>
   He is urging those who have money invested in oil-rich Sudan to
divest.
</P>
<P>
   About 25,000 Sudanese slaves have been freed - bought at about
$50 each - with the help of another organization, Christian
Solidarity International, based in Zurich, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   A group affiliated with the nondenominational Highland Church in
the New York borough of Queens is funding a new orphanage in Sudan
and mobile medical units to replace destroyed hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have no insulin, and no incubators,'' says Dana Antel, a
group member who visited Sudan recently. Many hospitals were
decimated in the civil war that has taken millions of lives since
1983, when fighting erupted between rebels from Sudan's Christian
and animist south and government troops from the Arab and Muslim
north.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial service is planned Saturday in front of the United
Nations for the Sudanese casualties. On Wednesday, a leaflet was
passed out with a photo showing a young man who was critically
burned, with the slogan: ''Christians Slaughtered for their
Faith.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Women's 400 Relay Team Set  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) -- Barring any unforeseen circumstances,
the U.S. women's 400-meter relay team for the Olympic final will
consist of Chryste Gaines, Gail Devers, Inger Miller and Marion
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   That foursome has yet to run together, but women's team coach
Karen Dennis, who was with the team's sprinters during a recent
European swing, said Thursday the plan was to run that group Sept.
30.
</P>
<P>
   Gaines, Devers, Miller and Jones were scheduled to run at
Brussels on Aug. 25, but the race was canceled.
</P>
<P>
   In the previous meet, at Monte Carlo, a team of Gaines, Devers,
Miller and Torri Edwards won in 42.15 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   After the Brussels cancellation, Miller returned home to train
and Edwards also went home because of her grandmother's death. So a
patchwork team of Gaines, Dawn Burrell, Passion Richardson and
Jones ran 42.95 at Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis said there still was plenty of time for the final four to
work together.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the four also will compete in individual events at the
games -- Jones in the 100 and 200 meters and long jump, Miller in
the 100 and 200, Devers in the 100 hurdles, and Gaines in the 100.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis said she had not yet decided about her final lineup for
the 1,600 relay, also to be run Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   She can choose from a group including Jones, who has said she
will attempt to win five gold medals, Jearl Miles-Clark, LaTasha
Colander-Richardson, Michelle Collins, Mikele Barber, Andrea
Anderson and Monique Hennagan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll wait until I see how the 400 shakes out,'' she said of
the Sept. 25 race. ''I'll see who's running the strongest.''
</P>
<P>
   Colander-Richardson, Collins and Hennagan are entered in the
400, Miles-Clark in the 800, and Anderson and Barber are part of
the relay pool.
</P>
<P>
   No matter whom she chooses for the 1,600 relay, Dennis is
confident about both relays.

   Men's coach John Chaplin has not yet decided upon his relay

Taylor, Alvin Harrison, Antonio Pettigrew and Michael Johnson for
the 1,600.

<HEADLINE> White Sox 13, Rangers 1  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Frank Thomas hit his AL-leading 41st home run and
the Chicago White Sox spoiled Scott Sheldon's adventure at all nine
positions with a 13-1 romp over the Texas Rangers on Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Johnson, Greg Norton and Magglio Ordonez also homered
for the AL Central-leading White Sox. Chicago scored seven runs in
the first inning, sending Rick Helling to the shortest start of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   The only bright spot for the Rangers -- or maybe it was comic
relief -- came from Sheldon, who became just the third player ever
to play all nine spots in one game. He joined Bert Campaneris
(Sept. 8, 1965) and Cesar Tovar (Sept. 22, 1968) as true utility
players.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon, normally a third baseman, entered the game in the
fourth inning at catcher. By the eighth, he was pitching and he
struck out the only batter he faced, Jeff Liefer.
</P>
<P>
   While his White Sox teamates were knocking in runs, Kip Wells
(5-7) was keeping the Rangers in check. Making his first start
since being recalled from Triple-A Charlotte, Wells pitched one of
his best games ever.
</P>
<P>
   Wells gave up one unearned run and four hits in seven innings.
He struck out four and walked only one.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Lamb drove in Texas' run with grounder in the third. The
Rangers had won three in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Helling gave up a whopping seven runs -- two of them homers --
before being yanked after getting just two outs. He gave up five
hits, walked three and threw 41 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   With their division lead down to 6&AMP;frac12; games, the White Sox head to
Cleveland this weekend for a series with the second-place Indians.
Chicago's offense seemed to be sputtering at a very inopportune
time as it managed just five runs in their first two games against
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But the White Sox broke out of their mini-slump in a hurry
Wednesday. After Helling walked Jose Valentin, Thomas homered to
left. His 41st homer of the season tied his career high, set in
1993, the year he won his first MVP award.
</P>
<P>
   The smoke from the fireworks hadn't even cleared when Ordonez
homered, giving the White Sox a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago then loaded the bases with a single by Carlos Lee and
walks to Paul Konerko and Norton, and Chris Singleton hit a two-run
single.
</P>
<P>
   After Johnson lined out, Ray Durham hit a two-run single to
center, giving the White Sox a 7-0 run and chasing Helling.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Sikorski relieved Helling and got the last out, but he
gave up five more runs. Norton, recalled from Triple-A Charlotte on
Tuesday, hit a three-run homer in the second and Johnson hit a
two-run shot in the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Helling's outing was his shortest start since May 11, 1994,
when he lasted just one inning. ... The White Sox have had
back-to-back homers 15 times this season, with Thomas and Ordonez
accounting for six of them.

<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Chris Truby hit a two-run homer in a seven-run
fifth inning, and Jose Lima won despite giving up two more homers
as the Houston Astros beat the Florida Marlins 13-5 Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Lima (7-15) allowed five runs and seven hits in eight innings,
striking out six and improving to 6-2 in 12 starts since July 9.
</P>
<P>
   But he gave up homers to Preston Wilson and pinch-hitter Chris
Clapinski. Lima has allowed 42 homers, eight short of the major
league record Bert Blyleven set with Minnesota in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Truby went 3-for-5, including a triple and three RBIs. Jeff
Bagwell and Richard Hidalgo each drove in three runs.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Sanchez (8-10) was tagged for eight runs and seven hits in
four-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   Truby put Houston ahead with an RBI triple in the first but
Derrek Lee's run-scoring single tied it in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Moises Alou's 27th homer again gave Houston the lead in the
bottom half, but Wilson's 25th homer, a three-run drive, gave
Florida a 4-2 lead in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Houston took a 6-4 lead in the big bottom half when Lugo and
Jeff Bagwell hit consecutive two-run doubles.
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo followed with an RBI double that chased Sanchez, and
Truby hit a two-run homer off Manny Aybar that made it 9-4.
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo added a sacrifice fly in the sixth. Clapinski hit his
first major league homer in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Houston added three runs in the eighth off Brad Looper in the
eighth and Bagwell's second double, Hidalgo's sacrifice fly and
Alou's RBI groundout.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Before pitching in the first, Sanchez complained about the
front of the mound. Groundskeepers spent nearly five minutes raking
and adding dirt to the area to satisfy him ... Mike Lowell ended a
16-game hitting streak with an 0-for-3 night ... Alex Gonzalez
extended his career-high hitting streak to 11 games.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Vladimir Guerrero hit two home runs and the
Montreal Expos stopped the St. Louis Cardinals' six-game winning
streak with a 7-2 victory Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Dustin Hermanson (11-12) struck out four, walked two and gave up
seven hits in eight innings as the Expos stopped their three-game
losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero hit his second home run in the eighth for his sixth
multihomer game, and 10th of his career. The two homers were the
first of his career at Busch Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals starter Garrett Stephenson (15-8) gave up four runs,
nine hits, struck out six and walked one in eight innings. He is
winless in his last two starts after winning his previous four
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis took a 1-0 lead in the third with the help of an error
by second baseman Jose Vidro. J.D. Drew singled and went to third
on a single by Jim Edmonds. Drew scored when Vidro bobbled a
grounder hit by Will Clark.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos took a 2-1 lead in the fourth when Vladimir Guerrero
hit his 33rd homer after a single by Andy Tracy.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos added another run in the fifth on back-to-back doubles
by Orlando Cabrera and Brian Schneider.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals got their second run in the eighth when drew
doubled and scored on a single by Will Clark.
</P>
<P>
   With the score 4-2 after Guerrero's second homer of the game,
reliever Alan Benes gave up the final three Expos runs in the
ninth. Cabrera, who reached on a double, scored on an error by
shortstop Edgar Renteria and a two-run homer by Milton Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Hermanson didn't allow any runners past second base after
Fernando Tatis' double in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Hermanson, who had lost three of his last five decisions, faced
the Cardinals for the first time since Sept. 26, 1998, when he
allowed Mark McGwire's 67th home run of the season.
</P>
<P>
   A loss would have dropped the Expos to a season-low 23 games
below .500. They were 42-42 at the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Cardinals had played 87 straight errorless innings
before Renteria's error in the eighth. ... Mike Matheny's
career-best 12-game hitting streak was stopped when he went
0-for-three with a walk. ... Tatis' double snapped an 0-for-19
streak.

<HEADLINE> Archeologists Discover Oldest Texts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Archeologists have found three 11th century wax
tablets containing copies of Christian psalms which may be the
oldest written artifacts ever found in Russia, The Moscow Times
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The tablets, bearing Psalms 75, 76 and 67, were unearthed this
summer during an excavation at an ancient site in Novgorod in
western Russia. The tablets have been dated to the first quarter of
the 11th century, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   A copy of the Christian gospels dating to around 1056 has until
now been considered the oldest surviving Russian book, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery at the excavation under the direction of Valentin
Yanin, one of the country's top archeologists, is regarded as a
major discovery, the report said. The find was recently announced
at an academic conference, it said.
</P>
<P>
   The tablets, which also contained the text of what appeared to
be a sermon, suggest that Christianity spread through Russia more
quickly than has been thought. The date of the tablets would place
them just a few decades after Christianity was first adopted in
Kiev far to the south, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Putin: Ban Militarization of Space  </HEADLINE>
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin on
Wednesday called upon world leaders to come to Moscow for a
conference to ban the militarization of space -- a challenge to any
American plan to build an anti-missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the Millennium Summit at the United Nations, Putin
described the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty as a
''foundation'' of the entire nuclear arms control system.
</P>
<P>
   ''Particularly alarming are the plans for the militarization of
space,'' Putin said.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the next year will see the 40th anniversary of
Russia sending the first man into space, Putin said that Moscow
will be the ''most proper place for such a conference.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not mention the United States in his address. But his
statement came as the latest signal that Russia would continue
pushing the United States to fully abandon its plans to deploy
defenses against missile threats from rogue nations, such as North
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has welcomed President Clinton's announcement that he
would leave the final decision on whether to deploy the missile
system to the next administration.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Wednesday, Putin also proposed to bar the use of
enriched uranium and pure plutonium in the world atomic energy
production. ''Incineration of plutonium and other radioactive
elements creates prerequisites for the final solution of the
radioactive residues problem,'' Putin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian leader followed up on his speech with a marathon
series of meetings with world leaders including Chinese President
Jiang Zemin, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami and Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid.
</P>
<P>
   He keeps up his busy diplomatic rounds on Thursday, when he is
scheduled to meet Israel's Prime Minister Ehud Barak and British
Prime Minister Tony Blair, among other leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting with Jiang gave Russia and China another chance to
speak against the ''unipolar world'' -- their favorite term to
describe the alleged U.S. domination of global affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We stand for the United Nations playing a stronger role in
global affairs,'' Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told
reporters after Putin's meeting with Jiang. ''We favor a multipolar
world based on respect for international law.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting with Schroeder mostly focused on economic issues,
and the two leaders agreed that the chancellor would soon visit
Moscow, probably as early as this month.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder and Putin said they would discuss Germany's bid to
become a permanent member of the United Nations' Security Council.
Ivanov said after the talks that Moscow was ready to support it.
</P>
<P>
   Putin is on his first trip to the United States as Russian
president.

<HEADLINE> Protests Abound At UN Summit  </HEADLINE>
By LUKAS I. ALPERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP)-- They were railing against China on East 35th
Street, deploring slavery in the Sudan on Third Avenue, championing
the Iranian government in exile on First Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere New Yorkers turned Wednesday, they found protesters
seizing a bit of the spotlight from the United Nations Millennium
Summit, their voices mingling with the honking of horns on
Manhattan streets.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, shopowners cooled their heels behind police barricades,
cut off from customers by tight security measures.
</P>
<P>
   ''You lose some business, but on the other hand you pick up with
the foreigners coming in to buy converters and adapters,'' said Bob
Kramer, co-owner of Kramer's Hardware, which was frequently blocked
by motorcades passing along Second Avenue and 49th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two protests were officially registered with police
Wednesday, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Falun Gong practitioners from around the world
gathered in the morning at a park opposite the Chinese Mission to
protest a crackdown on the movement's followers that began last
year in China.
</P>
<P>
   They sat, stock still, in silent meditative protest, and
listened to statements read by practitioners who said they had been
detained and beaten in China for practicing Falun Gong. The group
then rose in unison and marched in orderly rows to the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really hope that (Chinese President) Jiang Zemin will stop
persecuting people who want to do this. We have no other intentions
than peaceful ones,'' said Dong Li, a computer programmer from
Mamaroneck, who has practiced Falun Gong for a year.
</P>
<P>
   The march brought the Falun Gong protesters past the Sudanese
Mission on Third Avenue, where a group of 60 protesters demanded
the arrest of Sudanese President Omar el-Bashir.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why should the president of a slaving nation be allowed to
walk free on the streets of New York?'' asked Charles Jacobs,
president of the American Anti-Slavery Group, a Boston-based
organization that tries to raise awareness of forced labor around
the world. Sudan has denied allegations that its army was enslaving
captives taken in the country's civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Upon arriving at the United Nations, Falun Gong followers
silently hunkered down into the lotus position and began
meditating, while raucous neighbors nearby on Dag Hammerskjold
Plaza protested against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Later, they were all replaced by a new shift of demonstrators --
Iranians, sandwiched between Bangladeshis and anti-Castro Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is an insult to the free world that this man (Castro) is
here while the Dalai Lama was not allowed to attend'' last week's
international religious conference, said Yvonne Conde, a
Cuban-American writer who lives in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Later, about a dozen sympathizers of the Iranian National
Council of Resistance, a Paris-based group that considers itself
Iran's government in exile, sat in the middle of First Avenue near
the U.N., screaming that Iranian President Mohammad Khatami was a
terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrived shortly and arrested them.

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Carlos Febles doubled home the tying run
and scored on Johnny Damon's single as the Kansas City Royals
rallied in the bottom of the ninth inning to beat the New York
Yankees 3-2 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals beat New York for only the second time in nine games.
Derek Jeter and Paul O'Neill homered for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the ninth, Dave McCarty singled off Mike Stanton
(2-3). Pinch-runner Luis Ordaz scored on Febles' double, and Damon
followed with his fourth hit of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton blew his fourth straight save chance.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Meadows (4-2) pitched his second complete game of the
season for the Royals. He gave up nine hits, struck out three and
walked one.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch returned to the Yankees lineup and went 0-for-4
in his first game since going on the disabled list Aug. 3 with
tendinitis in his right elbow. The second baseman was mistake-free
recording two assists in a solid performance.
</P>
<P>
   New York's Orlando Hernandez pitched shutout ball into the
eighth inning, helping himself by starting two double plays. The
blown save by Stanton denied El Duque his fifth straight win.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Randa hit into both of the double plays started by
Hernandez, who also had two other assists on ground balls back to
the mound.
</P>
<P>
   The first double play came in the fourth inning, and the second
came in the eighth with runners on first and third and the Royals
trailing 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Meadows retired nine of the first 10 batters he faced. But Jeter
led off the Yankees fourth with a homer to left-center field, and
O'Neill bounced a ball off the top of the left-field bullpen gate
for a 2-0 lead with one out in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Jermaine Dye went 2-for-4 and started Kansas City's rally with
an RBI single in the eighth, cutting New York's lead to 2-1.
Notes: Yankees RHP David Cone will miss his scheduled start on
Sunday after separating his left shoulder in the third inning of
Tuesday's 10-5 win over Kansas City. An MRI exam on Wednesday
revealed minimal bruising, Cone said. Manager Joe Torre said he
would name Sunday's starter on Thursday. ... Damon is batting .545
(12-for-22) lifetime against Hernandez. ... The Royals are 34-34 at
home after a 14-4 start. ... Carlos Beltran, in his second start
since returning Monday from the disabled list, struck out four
times and was booed by the Royals crowd.

<HEADLINE> Argentine Unions March for Repeal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Leaders of some of Argentina's
most powerful unions marched Wednesday, calling for the repeal of a
labor reform bill at the center of a Senate bribery scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The march through downtown Buenos Aires drew 5,000 union
members, state workers and unemployed people and ended with a
demonstration in front of the presidential palace, the Casa Rosada.
</P>
<P>
   Hugo Moyano, head of the unofficial labor movement, warned in a
speech that the unions were prepared to do whatever it takes to
have the labor law and salary cuts for public workers struck down.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we have to strike, we will strike. If we have to fill the
squares with protesters, we will fill them.'' Moyano told a
cheering crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The labor law was passed in May by Congress, the centerpiece of
the economic strategy of the nine-month old administration of
President Fernando De la Rua. The measure was aimed at
kick-starting the sluggish Argentine economy out of its
16-month-old recession.
</P>
<P>
   The law seeks to increase labor flexibility and attract
investment by decentralizing collective bargaining and extending
the trial period of newly hired workers from 30 to 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   The law has become the focus of a Senate bribery scandal, in
which members of the governing Alliance administration are said to
have paid opposition Peronist senators to vote in favor of the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters at the march made it clear that they believed the
allegations fully. Many carried placards daubed with colorful
images of Labor Minister Alberto Flamarique.
</P>
<P>
   The unions also called on the government to reverse its decision
to cut salaries for state workers by up to 15 percent. The
reductions in salary were passed as part of an austerity plan
intended to meet guidelines of the International Monetary Fund
through tax hikes and spending cuts.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes for Mideast Accord  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- President Clinton labored Wednesday without
apparent success to impress Israeli and Palestinian leaders with a
sense of urgency as their deadline for a settlement loomed only a
week away.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart made no claim of progress
after Clinton's back-to-back meetings with Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. The spokesman also
gave no indication what Clinton might do next in trying to relaunch
Mideast peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did not expect today to be a breakthrough day in the
process,'' Lockhart said. ''That is true, but the process has not
broken down.''
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it
was difficult to remain optimistic but said Barak was still waiting
for an answer from Arafat to his proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Despite dimming prospects, the Clinton administration kept up
its diplomatic effort. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright went
from a dinner with the Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, to
Barak's hotel for a meeting with the Israeli leader just before
midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart credited the two sides with a continuing commitment to
come to terms, and he dismissed the deadline they set last year for
an accord as artificial. That deadline is next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''While there is a chance to reach an agreement we will remain
engaged,'' Lockhart said. ''It was useful to talk to these leaders
face to face.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had faced long odds in trying to relaunch his flagging
peace process by meeting with the Mideast leaders on the fringes of
the U.N. Millennium Summit.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he forged ahead, meeting first with Barak, for 50
minutes, at an East Side hotel, which was surrounded by throngs of
New York City police. The streets were virtually impassable, with
scores of police cars providing a further shield.
</P>
<P>
   A 90-minute meeting with Arafat followed.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, in a speech to the Millennium Summit, gave no quarter on
Jerusalem, a key stumbling block. ''We have agreed to share the
city, eliminate barriers and borders therein, in contrast to
attempts at monopolizing it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He called the city ''the cradle of Christ and the site of
Prophet Mohammed's ascension to heaven,'' making no mention of
Jews' attachment to the city for more than 2,000 years. He said the
Palestinians had compromised on Jerusalem and urged the Israelis to
do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, in turn, asked Arafat to join him in making painful
concessions for peace. ''We are at the ' and no one of us can cross
it alone,'' Barak said as Arafat listened impassively, his face
grim.
</P>
<P>
   With the Israeli and Palestinian leaders far apart on the core
issues and exchanging acrimonious sallies, Clinton all but gave up
on achieving a settlement by Sept. 13, the deadline they set last
year with his blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we can work through that if there is a sense of
progress,'' Clinton said as he met with Russian President Vladimir
Putin.
</P>
<P>
   ''The main thing they have to decide,'' he said, is that ''they
are going to have an agreement by what is the real calendar -- which
is the clock that is ticking in the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the tough core issues still eluding resolution are the
disposition of hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees and
the future of east Jerusalem, which Arafat demands be put under
Palestinian sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't expect an agreement over the city, unless the
Americans bring something new,'' said Palestinian negotiator Ahmed
Qureia.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestine Liberation Organization's Central Council meets
Saturday in Gaza City. The top item on the agenda is whether to
declare statehood on the West Bank land Israel has already turned
over to the Palestinians. Arafat plans to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Israeli parliament meets next month. Barak's
critics there have been outraged by his offers to Arafat of nearly
all the occupied territory and control over part of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton cautioned that the opportunity for a peace agreement
''is fleeting and about to pass.''
</P>
<P>
   In a speech at the U.N. General Assembly, he appealed to world
leaders: ''To those who have supported the right of Israel to live
in security and peace, to those who have championed the Palestinian
cause these many years, let me say to all of you: They need your
support now more than ever to take the hard risks for peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The president also set up meetings with Crown Prince Abdullah of
Saudi Arabia and King Abdullah of Jordan to try to rally Arab
support.
</P>
<P>
   Albright met with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa and
Prince Saud, the Saudi foreign minister. She set up a meeting with
Arafat before Clinton's, and talked for 45 minutes with Barak on
Tuesday night.

<P>
   MADISONVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A man charged with sexually
assaulting one of his stepdaughters forced their grandmother at
gunpoint to douse their trailer home with gasoline before it was
set on fire Wednesday. The stepdaughters and his own daughter were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Holiday, 21, was jailed on three capital murder charges
in lieu of a $750,000 bond, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Tela Mange, a spokeswoman for the Department of Public Safety,
said how the fire began was still being investigated.
</P>
<P>
   The youngsters were 18 months old, 5 and 7. The youngest was
Holiday's.
</P>
<P>
   The children's mother had left to call 911 and returned to find
her home in flames, Mange said. The grandmother escaped through a
window.
</P>
<P>
   Holiday was indicted in April for aggravated sexual assault of
one of his stepdaughters, according to the Madison County District
Attorney's Office.
</P>
<P>
   He was free on $10,000 bond while awaiting trial, and a
protective order barring any contact with his wife and the girls
was in place, Mange said.

<HEADLINE> City that hosts summit also gets many protests  </HEADLINE>
By LUKAS I. ALPERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP)- Honking horns mingled with voices of political
protest outside the walls of the United Nations on New York's
gridlocked streets Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   As the Millennium Summit began, demonstrators had their say on
everything from Middle East peace and slavery in Sudan to Cuban
leader Fidel Castro's presence and China's human rights policies.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, shopowners cooled their heels behind police barricades,
cut off from customers by tight security measures.
</P>
<P>
   ''You lose some business, but on the other hand you pick up with
the foreigners coming in to buy converters and adapters,'' said Bob
Kramer, co-owner of Kramer's Hardware, which was frequently blocked
by motorcades passing along Second Avenue and 49th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two protests were officially registered with police
Wednesday, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Falun Gong practitioners from around the world
gathered in the morning at a park opposite the Chinese Mission to
protest a crackdown on the movement's followers that began last
year in China.
</P>
<P>
   After sitting, stock still, in silent meditative protest, and
listening to statements read by practitioners who said they had
been detained and beaten in China for practicing Falun Gong, the
group rose in unison and marched in orderly rows the 12 blocks to
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong has attracted millions of followers with its
philosophy of exercise, meditation and beliefs drawn from Buddhism,
Taoism and the unorthodox ideas of its founder Li Hongzhi. While
followers say Falun Gong promotes health and morality, China's
government has banned it as a cult.
</P>
<P>
   ''We practice three principles - truth, compassion, and
forbearance,'' said Dong Li, a computer programmer from Mamaroneck,
who has practiced Falun Gong for a year. ''This apparently is not
concordant with Communist doctrine,''
</P>
<P>
   ''We really hope that (Chinese President) Jiang Zemin will stop
persecuting people who want to do this. We have no other intentions
than peaceful ones,'' Dong said.
</P>
<P>
   The march brought the Falun Gong protesters past the Sudanese
Mission on Third Avenue, where a group of 60 protesters demanded
the arrest of Sudanese President Omar el-Bashir. Two of the
protesters, former slaves from Sudan and Mauritania, said the
United States is doing nothing to stop enslavement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why should the president of a slaving nation be allowed to
walk free on the streets of New York?'' asked Charles Jacobs,
president of the American Anti-Slavery Group, a Boston-based
organization that tries to raise awareness of forced labor around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Upon arriving at the United Nations, Falun Gong followers
silently hunkered down into the lotus position and began
meditating, while raucous neighbors nearby on Dag Hammerskjold
Plaza protested Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Later, they were all replaced by a new shift of demonstrators -
Iranians, sandwiched between Bangladeshis and anti-Castro Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is an insult to the free world that this man (Castro) is
here while the Dalai Lama was not allowed to attend,'' said Yvonne
Conde, a Cuban-American writer who lives in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Later, about a dozen sympathizers of the Iranian National
Council of Resistance, a Paris-based group that considers itself
Iran's government in exile, sat in the middle of First Avenue near
the U.N., screaming that Iranian President Mohammad Khatami is a
terrorist. Police arrived shortly and arrested them.

<HEADLINE> Strike Threat Fades in Philly  </HEADLINE>
By HOPE YEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Teachers for the nation's sixth-largest
school district reported some progress during another round of
contract talks Wednesday as the immediate threat of a strike
appeared to fade.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Federation of Teachers said it was unlikely the
union would call a strike before next week because a court order
allows teachers to work under terms of their old contract until 5
p.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It gives us a little bit of breathing room, so students and
teachers can go back to the classroom, which is what everybody
wants, while talks go on,'' union spokeswoman Barbara Goodman said.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations came to a head earlier this week after the union's
rank-and-file members authorized a strike in the district of
205,000 students and 256 schools.
</P>
<P>
   The union has rejected district proposals to extend the school
day and school year, increase co-payments for health insurance,
base pay on performance rather than experience and level of
education, and give principals more say in job assignments.
</P>
<P>
   The union wants smaller classes, stronger early childhood
education, a new reading program and tighter school security.
</P>
<P>
   Another round of talks was scheduled for Thursday, the first day
of classes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The good news is that we talked seriously about a lot of
important issues,'' school district spokeswoman Alexis Moore said
Wednesday.

Clinton Pushes for Mideast Accord at Summit
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- President Clinton labored today without apparent success to
impress Israeli and Palestinian leaders with a sense of urgency as their
deadline for a settlement loomed only a week away. White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart made no claim of progress after Clinton's back-to-back meetings with
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Clinton
had faced long odds in trying to relaunch his flagging peace process by meeting
with the Mideast leaders on the fringes of the U.N. Millennium Summit.

his company could not be blamed but promised to notify Americans from now on

State Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity said President
Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, provided some information
Wednesday to his Russian counterpart, Security Council Secretary Sergei Ivanov,
during a meeting in New York. Also, the U.S. Navy's top officer, Adm. Vernon
Clark, sent a note to his Russian counterpart providing some detailed
information based on acoustical data collected by U.S. ships on the day of the

Man Pleads Guilty to '72 War Protest
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- An anti-Vietnam War activist whose criminal past was
uncovered when he ran for a suburban city council pleaded guilty today to
charges related to his 28-year flight from authorities. Howard Mechanic, 52,
lived in Arizona under the name Gary Tredway, establishing a career as a
successful business owner and activist whose role in the public sphere
ultimately was his downfall. After a reporter learned his identity earlier this
year, Mechanic turned himself in on a 1972 conviction for throwing a cherry bomb
during a protest at Washington University in St. Louis. He began the five-year
sentence in February.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Shocked at how simple it is for law enforcement to get
court permission to see the telephone numbers people dial, legislators today
discussed new bills aimed at tightening surveillance laws and put final touches
on a plan to address workplace privacy. The proposed wiretap bill would make it
more difficult for prosecutors to obtain court permission to monitor the
telephone numbers dialed by a suspect. The bill would require the same standard
of evidence now needed for permission to tap a telephone conversation. Two very
similar bills, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act and the Digital Privacy
Act, spawned from citizen concerns about their privacy online.

<HEADLINE> Firefighters Begin Heading Home  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON DININNY
<TEXT>
<P>
   HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- Firefighters are leaving Montana by the
planeload as officials begin demobilizing from the worst fire
season in decades.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday, 1,328 firefighters had gone through a fire camp in
Missoula either to head home or go to other fires across the
country. At least 300 firefighters returned to their homes in the
southeastern and southwestern United States on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The pendulum has now swung the other way,'' said Bill Cowin,
incident commander for a fire camp that has been set up in Missoula
to handle demobilization.
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday, 86 large fires were burning on 1.6 million
acres in Arkansas, California, Idaho, Mississippi, Nevada, South
Dakota, Montana, New Mexico, Wyoming and Texas, according to the
National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho. Nationwide, fires
have burned more than 6.6 million acres this year.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 10,000 firefighters are in Montana battling the state's
24 largest fires on 645,289 acres. Cooler temperatures and rain
have lessened the threat for more fires.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Stearns, a firefighter from Roscommon, Mich., joined nearly
500 other firefighters waiting for word on their next stop.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were hoping for another assignment,'' he said. ''We have
14-day assignments on these Western fires, and our assignment won't
be up until next Monday, but it look like we're going to be
(demobilized) because there's no fire activity right now. The rains
really helped.''
</P>
<P>
   Public land remained closed in parts of Montana's Bitterroot
National Forest, where hundreds of homes were evacuated during the
summer and 64 of them were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just important people realize that there are areas still
closed in our forests,'' said Cass Cairns, public affairs officer
for the Forest Service. ''We still have active fire out there, and
in terms of public safety, it's important that we keep some of
those areas closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Montana officials opened up millions of acres of public lands to
hikers and outdoor enthusiasts Tuesday. Favorable weather also
enabled Idaho to reopen more than 2 million acres.
</P>
<P>
   Texas firefighters haven't been as fortunate as those in the
Northern Rockies. A 12,000-acre fire near Newton, a timber city
near the Louisiana line, destroyed two homes and forced the
evacuation of about 30 others, Texas Forest Service spokesman
Gordon Gay said. The blaze had been nearly contained Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just running so fast we couldn't stop it,'' Gay said.
''With the high temperatures, dry weather and the fuel available,
there was nothing we could do.''
</P>
<P>
   In Nebraska, Gov. Mike Johanns authorized the use of 30
soldiers, helicopter and 5,000-gallon water tanker truck from the
Nebraska National Guard to fight at least six fires burning in
western Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest fire, about 10 miles long, was encompassed part of
the Schnurr Ranch and part of the Oglala National Grasslands near
Harrison. One was burning in timber southeast of Crawford forced
evacuations of eight homes.

<HEADLINE> Gore Outlines Economic Plan  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- In a cadence mimicking former President Bush's
''read my lips,'' Al Gore reached Wednesday for the mantle of
fiscal conservative, asking voters to ''read my plan'' in a hefty
budget book coupling balanced budgets and ambitious economic goals.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic presidential candidate denounced what he called
the ''cross-your-fingers economics'' of GOP rival George W. Bush,
the former president's son, and the broad income tax cuts at the
center of Bush's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Gore campaign was eagerly awaiting a vote
Thursday by leaders of the Teamsters that they expected would give
Gore the union's endorsement -- and the manpower that comes with it.
The Teamsters, because of their fierce opposition to Gore's
free-trade advocacy, which Bush shares, have been a holdout while
other major unions long ago endorsed the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   In his 191-page budget plan, heralded by President Clinton's
former Treasury secretary Robert Rubin as unprecedented in a
political campaign, Gore blended government activism and fiscal
caution. The only new proposal was to leave $300 billion of the
expected federal surplus unspent as a hedge against overly sunny
economic forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm doing this because I don't want you to have to read the
tea leaves,'' Gore told an audience of union activists and other
Democratic Party loyalists in a Cleveland State University
auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   ''Instead, you can just -- read my plan.'' His pauses, emphasis
and tone on the last three words recalled the elder Bush's 1988
''no-new-taxes'' campaign promise, in which he, too, emphasized
fiscal conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   ''The other side believes it's OK to spend more than the entire
surplus and then hope that the economy does better than anyone
expects,'' said Gore, who says Bush's plan devotes so much money to
a tax cut that there wouldn't be money left for important programs.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign also bought a full-page ad in Thursday editions
of The New York Times to tout his newly unveiled economic plan and
criticize Bush's proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning at the Wilkes-Barre airport in Pennsylvania, Bush
countered: ''My plan has been endorsed by Nobel prize winners. His
plan has been endorsed by Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   And in Wilmington, Del., running mate Dick Cheney targeted
Gore's targeted tax cuts -- for families saving for college tuition
or paying for long-term care, or for businesses making investments
in research, energy-efficient equipment or employee health
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ''The vice president says he supports tax cuts but only for a
few,'' Cheney said, calling Gore's plan a ''200-page press
release'' that offers ''lots of taxing rhetoric and little tax
relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Economist Robert Bixby of the fiscally conservative Concord
Coalition saluted Gore's focus on paying off the national debt
within 12 years but noted the plan is premised on surplus
projections. ''He can't guarantee that any more than he can
guarantee a nice day on Jan. 1, 2012,'' said Bixby.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as Bixby pored over Gore's new softcover book, he said
the budget aimed to achieve more debt reduction than anything he
had seen from Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Crossing paths with Bush, Gore was also in Detroit and the
Scranton, Pa., area on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin introduced Gore at the Cleveland campaign stop as a former
White House colleague and ''a force for doing what was right even
when it was politically hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore listed what he planned to achieve over a decade through
previously proposed targeted tax cuts and spending:
</P>
<P>
   -- Increase home ownership to 70 percent and family incomes by
one-third.
</P>
<P>
   -- Halve the wage gap between men and women.
</P>
<P>
   -- Create 10 million high-tech jobs.
</P>
<P>
   -- Give families their lowest tax burden in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   -- Reduce the poverty rate to one in 10 people.
</P>
<P>
   He credited his Democratic primary rival, former Sen. Bill
Bradley, for introducing the cause of fighting poverty into this
year's White House race.
</P>
<P>
   During a round of satellite TV interviews pitching his budget
plan to stations in other states, Gore showed a rare flash of
irritation in what has been a good couple of weeks for his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is crazy,'' he said, yanking out his earpiece. ''They're
screaming in my ear, there's singing.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was at the top of his game later as he threw batting
practice for the Detroit Tigers an hour before they met the Anaheim
Angels.
</P>
<P>
   As his number crunchers worked on a detailed dissection of
Bush's budget for release on Thursday, Gore told a $50,000
fund-raiser for Cuyahoga County Democrats that America needed a
leader who would not be ''playing around with funny numbers on
whether the budget adds up or not.''
</P>
<P>
   At Detroit's Fox Theater, Gore was raising $500,000 for the
Democratic National Committee. He planned to hammer his economic
message again Thursday in Scranton.
</P>
<P>
   Running mate Joseph Lieberman, speaking Wednesday at Southwest
Missouri State University, said he feared the Bush plan would ''be
a crushing blow for the financial markets and cause tremors around
the globe.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the plan would raise interest rates, driving up the cost
of business loans, mortgages, car payments, credit card bills and
student loans.
