Astronauts Fix Broken Equipment
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Two spacewalking astronauts fixed broken
equipment Sunday night on the outside of the international space station, flying
united with the shuttle Atlantis. It was the shuttle crew's second 200-mile-high
feat of the day. The first was the impeccable shuttle-station linkup. Jeffrey
Williams and James Voss emerged from Atlantis a little early. The 5-foot
construction crane was installed on the space station by another pair of
spacewalkers last spring. But it was never locked properly into its socket,
allowing it to swivel back and forth. Williams and Voss removed the crane from
its socket, then pushed it back in tight with a twist. They tugged at it, and it
was no longer wobbling.

No Survivors in Pa. Plane Crash
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) -- After experiencing engine problems while trying to
land Sunday, a commuter plane carrying 19 people home from a gambling trip to
Atlantic City, N.J., crashed in a ball of fire. There were no survivors. Fiery
wreckage was spotted in some woods about 9 miles south of the
Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport in northeastern Pennsylvania. It
appeared that both of the chartered turbo prop's engines failed, said Federal
Aviation Administration spokeswoman Tammy Jones. The plane missed its first
landing approach and crashed on its second attempt, said George Black of the
National Transportation Safety Board.

U.S. Cigarette Exports Drop
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans are rejecting the smoking habit at a
surprisingly rapid rate, a trend that is going global. But there are signs of
increased smoking in poor countries and among teen-agers and young women in
several countries, and deaths blamed on smoking still are rising worldwide. U.S.
cigarette exports are down 25 percent, with 50 billion fewer cigarettes sent
abroad in just one year. That is 2.5 billion fewer packs of cigarettes exported
each year. The number of cigarettes sold per person in the United States fell a
record 8 percent last year, according to government data and to a Worldwatch
analysis that also cites per-capita declines in some of the heaviest smoking
countries: France, Japan and, markedly, China, whose 1.25 billion people now
smoke one-third of the world's cigarettes.

   LONDON (AP) -- A British tabloid has recovered a stolen military laptop
believed to contain details of a fighter plane being developed jointly by the
United States and Britain, authorities confirmed Sunday. The Mirror, which
returned the computer to the Ministry of Defense, reportedly recovered the
laptop in a sting operation after being contacted by an unidentified computer
specialist who was given the computer and asked to delete ''fighter plane
stuff'' from its memory. The computer expert saw that the information was
sensitive and contacted the tabloid. The Mirror said in its Monday edition that
it secretly switched the stolen computer for another and handed it over to
authorities on Sunday.

<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- President Kim Dae-jung on Monday appointed the
head of a minority party as prime minister in a move expected to significantly
boost his political base. Lee Han-dong, the 65-year-old head of the United
Liberal Democrats, succeeded Park Tae-joon, who resigned last week over a tax
evasion scandal. Lee's appointment is subject to approval by the 273-member
National Assembly, where the main opposition Grand National Party has a
plurality of 133 seats. The assembly is expected to approve the appointment.

world's highest peak, the Nepalese Tourism ministry said. Babu Chhiri, 34, made
the climb through icy winds and rarified air to the 29,035-foot summit Sunday

<HEADLINE> 107 Injured After Walkway Collapses  </HEADLINE>
By JENNA FRYER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- The Winston stock-car race was winding down
and fans were streaming across a pedestrian bridge to the parking
lot when two loud cracks could be heard above the murmur of the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   With the second crack, an 80-foot section of the 320-foot
concrete-and-steel walkway snapped in half and fell onto the
highway outside Lowe's Motor Speedway on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 107 people received medical treatment, said track
spokesman Jerry Gappens. Fifty-three remained hospitalized Sunday,
two in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was an amazing sight; everyone disappeared,'' said Mike
Aquino, 41, of Atlanta, who was treated for minor injuries. ''There
was a mass of people, and then they were all gone. For a split
second, I was thinking I was going to die, and then I realized I
was going to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Piercing screams filled the humid night air as adults and
children slid and tumbled to the highway 17 feet below in a jumble
of broken concrete, coolers, sneakers and grills.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard it crack the first time, and the second time it went
down,'' said Greg Southern. ''It was just awful.''
</P>
<P>
   ''All of a sudden, the bottom fell out from everybody,'' said
Roger Dunham, who had just started across the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Steel bands in the concrete-and-steel bridge failed, said Don
Idol, an assistant engineer with the state Department of
Transportation. Exposed in the rubble, the steel showed signs of
corrosion, probably caused by moisture, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The collapsed bridge section, still connected to the intact
bridge parts, was slumped in a V-shape in the middle of the closed
highway. Crews planned to remove the debris before Monday morning's
rush hour.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could be a material problem, or it could be a construction
problem, maybe structural fatigue,'' said Don Goins, the state
Department of Transportation's chief engineer for field operations.
''We just have to look at that, and we don't know the answer yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The $1 million walkway was built in 1995 for pedestrian traffic
only. It was inspected when it first opened, but inspections
weren't required since then because it is owned by the speedway.
State-owned bridges must be inspected every two years.
</P>
<P>
   The walkway, and another one 500 yards away, carried thousands
of fans over four-lane U.S. 29 to parking lots across the way.
There were no vehicles on the road when the walkway collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Races at Lowe's Motor Speedway routinely draw six-figure crowds.
Track officials estimate that 180,000 people attended Saturday
night's NASCAR all-star race; other events there have drawn more
than 200,000 spectators.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 53 people still hospitalized Sunday was Dunham, who
worked at the track Saturday night. He counted himself lucky, even
though he spent Sunday being given painkillers for a back injury.
He recalled his concern for a little girl who was walking in front
of him when the walkway fell.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first thing I thought of was that little 3-year-old girl
who was underneath the whole pile,'' Dunham said. ''I wanted to
help people who were hurt a lot worse than I was, but I couldn't do
much. All I could do was hold this guy's head who was bleeding.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunham said he never found the girl, but learned Sunday she
wasn't seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   Tragedy has struck the speedway before, including last May, when
three spectators were killed by a tire that was sent spinning into
the stands after a crash. A lawsuit filed by the victims' families
was settled this month for an undisclosed amount.
</P>
<P>
   The next race scheduled at the speedway is Sunday's Coca-Cola
600. Qualifying starts Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Barbados Beats Cuba In Shootout  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Barbados scored on all five of its penalty kicks in a
shootout,
beating Cuba 5-4 after a 1-1 tie Sunday and advancing in World Cup
qualifying.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barbados will play in the semifinal round in a group that
includes the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Playing before a raucous home crowd at National Stadium in
Bridgetown, Barbados won when Cuba's Alexander Cruzada missed the
net on his penalty kick.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Sergei Prado opened the scoring in the 77th minute,
finally making good on a furious assault on the Barbadian goal.
</P>
<P>
   But Barbados roared back one minute later, with Jerry Alexander
scoring on a ball chipped into the penalty area by Michael Forde.
</P>
<P>
   Play was stopped briefly with 12 minutes remaining after
spectators began throwing bottles at the Cuban bench, claiming
Cuban players had thrown objects into the stands. Police said they
were investigating the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Panama beat Nicaragua 4-0 to win its group, while St.
Vincent and the Grenadines finished first in its division with a
4-0 rout of Antigua and Barbuda.
Panama 4, Nicaragua 0:
</P>
<P>
   At Panama City, Julio Dely Valdes scored twice and the victory
gave Panama nine points in the Central America-Caribbean region.
Guatemala, which also has nine points, finished second.
</P>
<P>
   Dely Valdez scored at 60 and 70 minutes. Nefatali Diaz scored in
the 72nd and Roberto Brown in the 84th.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams ended with 10 men on the field after Nicaragua's
Norman Gonzalez and Panama's Ricardo Phillips were ejected.
St. Vincent 4, Antigua 0:
</P>
<P>
   At Kingstown, the hosts got two goals from Alwyn Guy.
</P>
<P>
   St. Vincent's first goal came from Vincent John in the 11th
minute. Wesley John put a shot home in the 50th minute, with Guy
making his contributions in the 56th and 61st minutes against
goalkeeper Jarneil Simon.
</P>
<P>
   It was a reversal of the May 7 match, when Antigua beat St.
Vincent 2-1. This time, the Vincentians dominated the game, giving
its own goalkeeper, Melville Andrews, little work.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Rebels Threaten Executions  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Fiji's president on Sunday accused armed
rebels who are holding the prime minister and legislators hostage
of threatening to kill the captives if their demands for control of
the country are not met.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel leader George Speight denied the allegation, saying his
uprising in this South Pacific nation was a civilian coup, not an
act of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Speight said Monday he would ''resign'' if the nation's
influential Great Council of Chiefs does not back his coup attempt
when it meets Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A failed businessman, Speight appointed himself prime minister
after leading a gang of seven gunmen who stormed parliament on
Friday and said the country's first ethnic Indian-led government
was being replaced with ethnic Fijians.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the chiefs requested, 'George retire,' I'd retire,'' he
told journalists. ''Let the will of the people decide.''
</P>
<P>
   In a chilling sign Monday of rising tension among the coup
plotters, rebels reportedly dragged elected Prime Minister Mahendra
Chaudhry out of parliament and put a gun put to his head, Speight's
deputy Ratu Timoci Silatolu told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The claim could not immediately be confirmed as journalists have
been ordered out of parliament, where more than 20 Cabinet
ministers and lawmakers were still being held.
</P>
<P>
   Silatolu said the threat to Chaudhry's life was made because of
rumors of intervention by outside forces to end the four-day
standoff, local news Web site Fijilive.com reported.
</P>
<P>
   As the confrontation continued, police and soldiers stepped up
security in the capital, Suva.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between the rebels and President Ratu Sir
Kamisese Mara -- the normally titular head of state who has assumed
powers of government under state-of-emergency laws -- deteriorated
Sunday after Mara rejected Speight's request for direct talks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will not have any dialogue with those who are imprisoning
the parliamentarians and bear arms in the parliament complex unless
they are freed,'' Mara said at a news conference. ''I learned from
him afterwards ... that what he was going to tell me was that if I
don't follow what he says, he will start executing hostages one by
one.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in parliament, Speight denied such a plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''To suggest that we would embark on such an action as a
resolution is just irresponsible and crazy,'' he said. ''I am
giving the world my word. ... I am guaranteeing their safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Mara said Speight was demanding the president step down and
allow his group to run the country. ''That I will not be able to
oblige,'' Mara said.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis began Friday morning when gunmen, their heads swathed
in black hoods, stormed into the main chamber of Fiji's parliament.
Brandishing machine guns, rifles and pistols, they ordered shocked
lawmakers not to move while they cuffed their hands with plastic
ties. Speight then appeared, firing one shot into the air and
declaring: ''This is a coup. I'm in charge now.''
</P>
<P>
   Speight told them he was overturning Prime Minister Mahendra
Chaudhry's government and taking power on behalf of indigenous
Fijians, who he said have been discriminated against by the
government led by Fijians of Indian descent.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were scared we would be killed,'' said John Ali, Housing
and Transport Minister in Chaudhry's year-old coalition. ''We were
helpless.''
</P>
<P>
   Ali was one of nine lawmakers who were released Sunday, and the
first to give an inside account of the hostages' treatment.
Chaudhry and more than 20 other members of his government were
still being help captive.
</P>
<P>
   After the rebels burst in and secured their prisoners, they
marched the ethnic Indians among them to a downstairs office,
separating them from the government's native Fijian members. Ali
said that when told by a rebel to get moving, Chaudhry defied him,
saying sternly: ''I won't take orders from you.'' The prime
minister relented when the rebel pointed his rifle at him and told
him he was about to be shot.
</P>
<P>
   Speight claims he annulled Fiji's constitution and Mara's
presidency when his group raided parliament, and that he now rules
Fiji by decree. But he has almost no support. Police and military
chiefs reiterated Sunday that they support the constitution, Mara
and Chaudhry's government.
</P>
<P>
   Speight received his first public support Sunday in a statement
distributed by two influential native Fijian groups. Ratu Tevita
Bolobolo, leader of the Taukei movement of indigenous Fijians,
issued a joint statement endorsed by the main opposition party,
known as SVT.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not and we will never accept the reinstatement of the
Chaudhry government,'' Bolobolo said. ''We hereby ... warn Ratu
Mara that any intervention by force will lead to all out civil
war.''
</P>
<P>
   For months, ethnic tensions have been building between
indigenous Fijians and the descendants of Indian migrants, who
dominate commerce in this country 2,250 miles northeast of Sydney,
Australia. Indians make up about 44 percent of Fiji's population of
813,000, while indigenous Fijians account for 51 percent. Chaudhry
is Fiji's first prime minister of Indian extraction.
</P>
<P>
   A state of emergency continued across the country, and a
dusk-to-dawn curfew was being enforced by police.

<HEADLINE> New York Harbor to host history's 'largest maritime event'  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD PYLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- If predictions hold, it will dwarf the Spanish
armada, the Normandy invasion fleet and every regatta ever held --
as many as 70,000 watercraft jammed into New York harbor for what
organizers call the ''largest maritime event in history.''
</P>
<P>
   The weeklong affair, starting July 3, combines two events:
Operation Sail 2000, the latest gathering of wind-powered tall
ships, will bring more than 180 vessels from 60 nations. And 40
modern warships of 23 navies will come for an International Naval
Review, the sixth in 107 years.
</P>
<P>
   New York is the most important port of call in the tall ships'
nine-week cruise from San Juan, Puerto Rico, on May 25 to Portland,
Maine, on July 31, with stops in Miami, Norfolk, Va., Baltimore,
Philadelphia and New London, Conn. The so-called parade of sail is
expected to be 30 miles long.
</P>
<P>
   But the real story could be the thousands of commercial and
private yachts, sailboats, cabin cruisers and other small craft
flooding into New York. The Coast Guard recently upped its estimate
from 40,000 to 70,000 -- nearly three times the number at the 1986
Statue of Liberty centennial.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard Warrant Officer Lionel Bryant said the estimate is
based on contacts with marinas and boat owners.
</P>
<P>
   ''We expect boats from Chesapeake Bay to Florida, and some
owners plan to trailer boats cross-country, from as far away as
Colorado,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It has been jokingly suggested that one might be able to walk
across the harbor stepping from deck to deck without ever getting
wet, said Capt. Woody Berzins, a Navy spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Space off Brooklyn's Bay Ridge section is reserved for the liner
Queen Elizabeth II and more than 20 other vessels over 197 feet
long.
</P>
<P>
   Private craft can anchor singly or ''raft'' together to avoid
tangling lines. The Coast Guard expects every kind of boat -- from
100-foot yachts and hired fishers to small runabouts and
daysailers, Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some people may even come out in kayaks, although that might
get a bit uncomfortable after nine hours,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard will supplement its patrol fleet with Coast
Guard auxiliary members and reservists. Seeking a ''good neighbor''
atmosphere, Bryant said, it will impose a dusk curfew on jet-skis
and discourage the pumping out of holding tanks at anchor. Cell
phones probably will be useless in the communications crush.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is going to be a very difficult job ... but we definitely
have the experience and expertise to do it,'' he said. ''It will be
something like Times Square on New Year's Eve for the New York
Police Department.''
</P>
<P>
   On July 4, President Clinton is expected aboard the missile
cruiser USS Hue City to review the naval cruisers, destroyers and
frigates anchored in a 17-mile line from the George Washington
Bridge on the Hudson River to the Verrazano Bridge linking Staten
Island to Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   He then moves to the aircraft carrier USS John F. Kennedy,
anchored off the Statue of Liberty, to watch the stately procession
of tall ships -- schooners, brigantines, barques and square-riggers
-- pass up the harbor, while 80 aircraft buzz overhead.
</P>
<P>
   A July 4 fireworks display -- the largest in the world to date,
according to one hyperbolic OpSail 2000 statement -- will use 13
barges at five different harbor locations.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Sail, established by President Kennedy in 1961 to
promote international relations and cultural exchange, has figured
in such landmark events as the 1964 New York World's Fair, the U.S.
Bicentennial in 1976, the Statue of Liberty centennial in 1986 and
the Christopher Columbus Quincentennial in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   OpSail describes itself as a nonprofit organization ''dedicated
to sail training and goodwill among nations.'' It draws corporate
support, provides scholarships and has many business leaders,
admirals and navy-oriented lawmakers and government officials on a
board of trustees whose honorary chairman, fittingly, is
ex-anchorman Walter Cronkite.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, OpSail expects as many as 180 wind-powered vessels.
The flagship will again be the U.S. Coast Guard training barque
Eagle, originally a trophy seized from Nazi Germany in World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   Most others are also naval training vessels, such as the Chilean
navy's 371-foot four-master Esmerelda, Venezuela's Simon Bolivar,
Italy's triple-decked Amerigo Vespucci and Germany's 295-foot
barque Groch Fock.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is sending the four-masters Kruzenshtern and Mir, both
from St. Petersburg. Others include the Philadelphia-based Gazela,
the oldest wooden square-rigger in active service, built in 1883 in
Portugal; Amistad, a recreation of a famed 19th-century slave ship;
and Britain's HMS Rose, a replica of an Elizabethan-era vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina, Bulgaria, Canada, Denmark, India, Ireland, Japan,
Romania, Spain, Sweden and Ukraine are among other countries
participating.
</P>
<P>
   The most familiar silhouette in the naval lineup will be the
aging carrier JFK -- described in a congressional resolution as
''the symbol of the international goodwill of the United States.''
The conventionally powered carrier, based at Norfolk, Va., is a
fixture of New York's annual Fleet Week -- welcome in the harbor
from which the Navy's newer, nuclear-powered carriers are barred.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Clinton, some 5,000 Navy guests will watch the show
from the flight decks of the JFK, USS Mount Whitney and USS Nassau.
Five other U.S. warships will dock alongside Manhattan, Brooklyn
and Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   While past naval reviews commemorated landmarks in U.S. history,
this year's joint event will serve as the Navy's official
observance of the new millennium, which most people celebrated last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The delay has some tradition behind it since at New York's first
International Naval Review, President Grover Cleveland marked the
400th anniversary of Columbus's initial voyage to the New World -- a
year late, in 1893.

<HEADLINE> National Zoo To Borrow New Pandas  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Panda House at the National Zoo, vacant
since giant panda Hsing-Hsing died six months ago, will get two new
residents under a 10-year, $10 million loan agreement with China.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese Embassy announced Sunday that Beijing has given
final approval to lend two giant pandas to the National Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   As outlined in a letter of intent signed April 7, the deal calls
for the Smithsonian Institution, which operates the zoo, to donate
$1 million a year for 10 years to China to essentially rent the
pandas.
</P>
<P>
   ''The two sides are firmly committed to the survival of giant
pandas and their habitats through habitat protection, scientific
research, public education, captive breeding, professional training
and other conservation biology measures,'' an embassy statement
said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the $10 million payment for the loan of one male
and one female ''captive-born pre-productive'' giant panda will go
for research and conservation of the endangered black-and-white
animals.
</P>
<P>
   China will retain ownership of the new pandas, as well as any
offspring that result.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are very pleased to learn of the decision from the Chinese
government and gratified at the speed with which they approved our
request,'' Smithsonian Institution Secretary Lawrence M. Small said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman David J. Umansky said the Smithsonian already has
received commitments of $5.8 million toward the $10 million cost.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to speculate how long it will be before the two new
pandas take up residence in the Panda House. It has been empty
since last November, when the elderly Hsing-Hsing, suffering from
terminal kidney disease, was euthanized. His partner, Ling-Ling,
died in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The pair produced several cubs, but none survived more than a
few days. Both pandas were given to the United States by China in
1972 and became the top attraction at the zoo, which draws some 3
million visitors a year.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and Chinese officials still have to determine which male
and female pandas will be chosen, when they will be delivered and
other details. The next step for U.S. officials is to obtain an
import permit from the Fish and Wildlife Service.
</P>
<P>
   Only five giant pandas are in U.S. zoos -- three in San Diego and
two in Atlanta. Fewer than 1,000 live in the wild.

<HEADLINE> L'Enfant -- Exasperating Genius  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- To put it simply, the man was exasperating.
Major Pierre Charles L'Enfant, military engineer turned city
planner was self-righteous, hot-headed, imperious, unreasonable,
arrogant, scornful of authority and quick to take offense.
</P>
<P>
   It took a century to make clear he was also a genius.
</P>
<P>
   As chief designer of the new national capital, L'Enfant quickly
antagonized the three commissioners in charge of making sure the
place got built. When they complained, he alienated his principal
supporters, including George Washington, who reluctantly fired him.
</P>
<P>
   He spent the rest of his life dunning Congress for back pay, as
lean and ragged as the dog that trailed him through the streets.
</P>
<P>
   When L'Enfant died in poverty in 1825 his obituary called him
''an interesting but eccentric gentleman.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people supposed that was the end of Pierre L'Enfant.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Paris into a family of artists, L'Enfant arrived in
America in 1777, the year he turned 23. After service in the
Revolutionary War as an engineer, he attracted the attention of the
new country's leaders by designing Federal Hall in New York City.
And when a design was needed for an entirely new federal city to be
built in a 10-mile square on the banks of the Potomac River,
L'Enfant was ready.
</P>
<P>
   He had a vision of what an American capital could be, a
forerunner to the motto, ''Make no little plans.''
</P>
<P>
   ''No nation perhaps had ever before the opportunity offered them
of deliberately deciding on the spot where their capital city
should be fixed ...,'' L'Enfant wrote President Washington in 1789.
</P>
<P>
   ''And altho' the means now within the power of the country are
not such as to pursue the design to any great extent it will be
obvious that the plan should be drawn on such a scale as to leave
room for that aggrandizement and embellishment which the increase
of the wealth of the nation will permit it to pursue at any period
however remote.''
</P>
<P>
   That translated to a radiating sweep of broad avenues
intersected by a grid of north-south streets and punctuated by
circles and squares ready to accept the monuments of future
national heroes.
</P>
<P>
   The vision was as poetic as architectural. L'Enfant placed the
Capitol on prosaically named Jenkins Hill, finding in its shape ''a
pedestal awaiting a monument.''
</P>
<P>
   He connected the Capitol to the President's House by a mile-long
avenue, leaving plenty of room for parkland and cascades of water.
</P>
<P>
   Washington was confident ''that for projecting public works and
carrying them into effect he was better qualified than anyone who
had come within my knowledge in this country, or indeed in any
other.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, the president said, was that L'Enfant would brook
no interference with his ideas, accept no alteration of his plans.
</P>
<P>
   So when Daniel Carroll, one of the largest and most influential
landowners in the new District of Columbia started to take his
orders from the commissioners, L'Enfant repeatedly made clear he
would not do it.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the city went on without him, generally following
the plan he had made.
</P>
<P>
   With his plans rolled under his arms for instant display,
L'Enfant fruitlessly lobbied Congress for redress of ancient
wrongs.
</P>
<P>
   When he died, living on the charity of friends, his personal
effects were valued at $44.
</P>
<P>
   Some people started calling the city L'Enfant had designed as
''the city of magnificent distances.'' When Charles Dickens visited
in 1844 he amended that to ''the city of magnificent intentions''
marked by ''spacious avenues that begin in nothing, and lead
nowhere.'' It was designed, he noted, ''by an aspiring Frenchman.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the 20th century neared it was clear that the city
did not match the achievements and aspirations of the country.
</P>
<P>
   But when architects and engineers and artists went to work to
transform Washington into ''the city beautiful,'' they found their
guide and inspiration already spelled out in the plans L'Enfant had
drawn a century before.
</P>
<P>
   L'Enfant's stock was high. A movement started to give the major
national recognition.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1909 L'Enfant's remains were removed from the
garden of the house in Maryland where they had rested since 1825.
They were reinterred with military honors on the hillside at
Arlington National Cemetery overlooking the radiating avenues and
circles and squares L'Enfant had designed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Few men can afford to wait a hundred years to be remembered,''
Secretary of State Elihu Root said when a permanent memorial was
dedicated two years later.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not a change in L'Enfant that brings us here,'' he said.
''It is we who have changed, who have become able to appreciate his
work. And our tribute to him should be to continue his work.''

<HEADLINE> Democrat: Unions Against China Vote  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID KOENIG
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- The biggest name on a shrinking list of
undecided lawmakers, Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas, says he expects
some labor unions to take revenge on Democrats who vote for a
permanent trade agreement with China.
</P>
<P>
   ''My guess is when it's over, people who wind up voting for it,
there will be some international unions that will not be active in
their campaigns,'' Frost, the third-ranking House Democrat, said in
an interview.
</P>
<P>
   He cited the Teamsters and the United Auto Workers, although he
added they have not threatened him. Efforts to reach officials of
the unions over the weekend were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Frost himself is an example of a Democrat facing conflicting
pressures over easier trade with China.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations based in his Dallas-area district, including
American Airlines, Texas Instruments and Electronic Data Systems
Corp., have lobbied him to support the bill. But labor leaders,
including AFL-CIO President John Sweeney and Teamsters chief James
P. Hoffa, have pressed him to vote no.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a close call. China is the largest country in the world,
the largest potential market for us. You have to take that into
account,'' Frost said. ''You also have to take into account the
treatment of their own people and also the concerns of labor.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say the trade agreement threatens the jobs of American
workers and strips the United States of leverage to improve human
rights in China and press the Chinese to keep their international
commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters, including President Clinton and most Republicans,
say the deal is good for the U.S. economy and can help lead to
human rights and political reforms in China.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a big deal to me, beyond the obvious economic benefits
which make it easier for some members than others to vote for,
because of the economic makeup of their districts,'' Clinton said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   A House vote on the trade status bill is scheduled for midweek,
and Republican Whip Tom DeLay of Texas said momentum for the
measure was growing. Passage in the Senate is nearly assured.
</P>
<P>
   Frost has asked the administration to pay for modernizing a
Northrop Grumman Corp. military aircraft plant that employs 5,000
people, but he denies it's a quid pro quo for a yes vote. Help for
the facility in Grand Prairie could give Frost political cover --
many of the jobs are union, and it is the largest employer in his
district.
</P>
<P>
   Although Frost has courted union support during his 11 terms in
the House, he has voted for other trade bills opposed by labor,
notably the 1993 North American Free Trade Agreement. He also has
voted in the past to renew China's normal trade status on an annual
basis.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials in Texas are bracing for another disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ''This vote is extraordinarily important to us -- I don't know of
one this year that's bigger,'' said Ed Sills, a spokesman for the
Texas AFL-CIO. ''There's no question Martin Frost's voting record
on issues important to working people is excellent. It may be less
excellent after this vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Sills said the labor federation figures to support Frost even if
he votes for the China agreement, but he warned that such Democrats
risk losing the support of union households in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''After the NAFTA vote, there were a significant number of
people in organized labor who weren't very enthusiastic in the 1994
election,'' in which Democrats lost control of the House, Sills
said. ''We don't want that to happen this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Frost played down the possible impact of the China vote this
fall, when Democrats hope to regain control of the House.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could make a difference in a few districts, but I don't
think that what labor does or doesn't do in certain districts is
going to prevent us from taking back the House,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of a well-known opponent in the November election could
make it easier for Frost to buck labor.
</P>
<P>
   ''People like Frost, who seem vulnerable now, will vote for it
and escape without suffering a loss for that reason alone except
where their race is already close,'' said Bruce Buchanan, a
political scientist at the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Frost will face a political novice, James Bryndan Wright, a
former aide to House Majority Leader Dick Armey, whose
congressional district neighbors Frost's.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't expect much of a race,'' Frost said.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the Democratic Caucus, Frost is below only
Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri and Minority Whip David
Bonior of Michigan in the hierarchy of House Democrats. Both
Gephardt and Bonior oppose the China deal.

<HEADLINE> Lobbyists Cashing in as Advisers  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Washington insiders George W. Bush has
assembled to advise his Republican presidential campaign bring far
more to the table than just experience. Their lobbying firms
collected more than $34 million last year to influence the
government, federal filings show.
</P>
<P>
   Their clients range from America Online and Time Warner, who are
seeking federal permission to merge, to the American Association of
Health Plans, the group of managed care organizations trying to
defeat legislation giving patients the right to sue.
</P>
<P>
   The story is much the same for Bush's Democratic rival, Vice
President Al Gore, whose inner circle draws heavily on the advice
of former government officials-turned-lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of the modern political arena, where former
government officials command big bucks as lobbyists and then are
summoned back during elections by presidential candidates needing
their experience.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the lobbyists' clients often become involved by
making big donations to the parties of their presidential nominees.
</P>
<P>
   ''If George W. Bush wins, (the Republican lobbyists) all put
their children and their grandchildren through college because of
this windfall,'' said Charles Lewis, head of the Center for Public
Integrity, a government watchdog group.
</P>
<P>
   ''They will become the most powerful, popular lobbyists in
Washington and they will stand to make millions of dollars because
of their perceived closeness to power.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, the lobbying firm of Peter Knight, a
former top aide to Gore and manager of President Clinton's 1996
re-election campaign, was paid $1.5 million last year by such
clients as Lockheed Martin, the International Olympic Committee and
Schering-Plough. In 1995, Tennessee developer Franklin Haney,
trying to get the Federal Communications Commission to move to his
Portals development in Washington, paid Knight $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Knight's firm has since disbanded and he is no longer lobbying.
</P>
<P>
   One lobbyist advising Texas Gov. Bush said his effort is about
being a good Republican, not an effort to improve his business.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are millions of Republicans supporting Governor Bush. I
am proud to be one of them,'' said Edward Gillespie, a former top
aide to House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   At least a half-dozen other registered Washington lobbyists also
are on Bush's team. They include former Reps. Vin Weber and Bill
Paxon, former Republican National Chairman Haley Barbour, ex-White
House aides Kenneth Duberstein and Rick Davis and longtime
Washington political operative Charles Black.
</P>
<P>
   Weber, Duberstein and Davis switched their allegiance from Sen.
John McCain after the Arizona Republican withdrew from the
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's inner circle also relies heavily on lobbyist-advisers.
</P>
<P>
   They include former Rep. Thomas Downey of New York, former
domestic policy adviser Greg Simon, former White House counsel Jack
Quinn and Knight.
</P>
<P>
   Their lobbying firms earned $9.6 million in fees last year from
such companies as General Motors, Boeing, Intel, MetLife and Bell
Atlantic, according to disclosure forms filed with the House and
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Another Gore adviser, Roy Neel, heads the U.S. Telecom
Association, which represents independent phone companies and spent
$1.7 million lobbying the government last year.
</P>
<P>
   The seven lobbyists advising Bush work for firms that reported
receiving $34.2 million last year in fees to influence the
government. In addition to the entertainment giants and HMO group,
their clients include:
</P>
<P>
   --Philip Morris, one of the tobacco companies opposed to allowing
the Food and Drug Administration to regulate nicotine.
</P>
<P>
   --Microsoft, sued by the Justice Department on antitrust charges.
</P>
<P>
   --Bristol Myers-Squibb, which has a stake in the debate over
whether to expand Medicare benefits to cover prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Bush said the advisers have impressive credentials that
earn them their position in the campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are long-standing Republicans, held in high regard, who
have expertise to share on how to win back the White House,''
campaign spokesman Ari Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether his ties to Bush might be helpful in landing
clients, Gillespie said: ''I haven't even thought about it.''

<HEADLINE> Hatteras Lighthouse To Reopen  </HEADLINE>
By ESTES THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUXTON, N.C. (AP) -- Ten months after the Cape Hatteras
Lighthouse's majestic journey to a new home a half-mile from the
crashing Atlantic breakers, its keepers are spiffing it up for
well-wishers.
</P>
<P>
   Floors and staircases are being swept and windows reinstalled in
anticipation of its official public reopening Friday. The 208-foot
lighthouse, the nation's tallest and best-known, has been closed to
visitors since Nov. 22, 1998. The move, costing $10 million and
spanning several weeks, was completed in July.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to sweep it out and wipe it down and make it
presentable before we let people in,'' Ranger Rob Bolling of the
National Park Service said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the lighthouse was moved, Hurricane Dennis flooded
the lighthouse grounds and blew sand into the structure.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the 4,800-ton lighthouse now sits 2,900 feet from
its former perch 150 feet from the ocean is a minor miracle.
</P>
<P>
   When it went into service in 1870, the lighthouse stood 1,600
feet from the ocean -- the same distance from the beach as now, but
over the decades erosion brought the ocean steadily closer.
</P>
<P>
   The move initially was fiercely opposed by Hatteras Island
residents, who feared the lighthouse might topple or that moving it
would dilute its historical significance.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Danny Couch, of Buxton, a leading opponent, salutes the
Park Service and its contractors for doing the job safely. Yet he
still believes the government could have stabilized the beach and
protected the lighthouse at its old site.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still think its impact was so much greater by the sea,''
Couch said. ''With it moved, I feel it does not have the same
historical and visual impact. It feels contrived to me.''
</P>
<P>
   But that view isn't shared by visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was relieved to hear they were going to do something,'' said
Michael Crowley of Richmond, Va. ''I resented all the opposition
from the local population. I thought it was kind of selfish.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cape Hatteras stands to a lot of people as America's
lighthouse. It's a national treasure, not a Dare County thing,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The lighthouse was built before electricity was common in most
homes. Steam engines sucked water out of the hole dug for the
foundation, and oxen powered the pulleys that hoisted brick, tools
and men up the structure as it was built.
</P>
<P>
   When it was moved, the latest technology was employed. It was
severed from its foundation, jacked up and placed on a bed of
rollers. Hydraulic jacks slowly pushed it to its new home.
</P>
<P>
   Between 300,000 and 500,000 people came to watch the feat, named
the outstanding civil engineering achievement for 1999 by the
American Society of Civil Engineers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Besides being an incredible engineering feat, this project
spoke volumes about the American spirit,'' said Francis Peltier,
superintendent of Cape Hatteras National Seashore.
</P>
<P>
   The lighthouse will be rededicated next May at a gathering of
descendants of Hatteras lighthouse keepers. A book of oral
histories about the lighthouse will be published to commemorate the
event.
</P>
<P>
   Cal Drake, a visitor from Hendersonville, said he came to watch
the move last summer and ''marveled for two days.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the greatest engineering feat I've ever seen, and I've
seen the space shuttle launch,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> China Deal Boosts U.S. Technology  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL WHITE
<TEXT>
<P>
   THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. (AP) -- Business is booming at tiny
International Technologies Network Inc., thanks to China's growing
trade with the United States and other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Annual revenues for the company have soared from $400,000 in
1998 to a projected $12 million this year as a result of demand for
its services that match U.S. technology companies with Chinese
partners for joint manufacturing ventures.
</P>
<P>
   The future for ITN and its 14 employees may be even brighter if
Congress approves permanent normal trade relations with Beijing,
which is being debated in the U.S. House this week.
</P>
<P>
   If terms of the agreement are fully implemented,
technology-focused companies, from small consultants like ITN to
giants such as Motorola, Lucent and IBM, will be among the big
winners under expanded trade between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
   American farmers battered by low commodity prices also stand to
gain in a big way. Cotton growers across the Sun Belt already are
increasing acreage on the expectation of a healthier export market
stimulated by falling Chinese tariffs. Growers of soybeans, wheat
and other grains also are looking at better foreign sales.
</P>
<P>
   ''Half of what I grow is exported,'' said Scott Fritz, who has
1,300 acres of soybeans near Winamac, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   ''China being the world's most populous country, it's just
extremely important that agriculture be given a chance to sell our
products to the Chinese. I don't know what I can say to emphasize
how critical this is to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal would be another burden for labor-intensive U.S.
industries like textiles and footwear, which would face increased
competition from Chinese competitors.
</P>
<P>
   And high-tech companies, manufacturers and other businesses
might see improved trade relations as an opportunity to export
assembly jobs to take advantage of low wages in China.
</P>
<P>
   America already has lost nearly 700,000 jobs to China, and could
lose as many as 872,000 more over the next decade if the trade deal
goes into effect, said Robert Scott, an economist at the Economic
Policy Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ''We ship them parts and components and they ship us completed
products. Labor is going out of the equation,'' he said. ''It may
be in the interest of companies to outsource production, but it
isn't good for labor in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those jobs will be lost anyway to developing countries
with low labor costs, supporters of the trade deal argue. In the
meantime, increased trade with China would generate new jobs for
Americans, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not an issue of more jobs, but of better jobs,'' said Dan
Griswold, a trade analyst at the Cato Institute in Washington.
''The sectors of the U.S. economy that will gain the most from this
are the sectors that will pay well: the high-tech sectors, the
service sectors.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether either forecast comes true depends on the House vote
later this week on ending Congress' annual review of China's trade
status.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1980, trade with China has been subjected every year to an
acrimonious debate that focuses more on human rights and U.S.
foreign policy than commerce. Ending the annual review would
elevate China to the same trade status most other nations have with
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The change would clear the way for a potentially lucrative trade
agreement that promises to drastically slash Chinese tariffs on a
wide range of U.S. goods, from food to electronic equipment to
automobiles. The deal -- negotiated last November in return for U.S.
support for China's entry into the World Trade Organization -- also
would open China to American banks, insurance companies and law and
accounting firms.
</P>
<P>
   Tariffs on U.S. products would drop on average from 17 percent
to 10 percent by 2005. Automobile tariffs would fall from 80
percent or more to 25 percent by 2006. Tariffs on high-tech
appliances would fall from an average of 13.3 percent to zero by
2005. Software tariffs would drop from 30 percent to nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The changes could double U.S. exports to China from an estimated
$13.1 billion in 1999, according to an analysis by the Goldman
Sachs investment firm. Agriculture exports would increase by $2
billion, while exports of high-tech electronics, worth $1.8 billion
in 1998, would rise 25 percent or more, the study predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese exports to the United States, valued at $81.9 billion,
are expected to increase at a slower rate, the Congressional
Research Service says.
</P>
<P>
   China's membership in the WTO would mean that organization would
help settle disagreements between U.S. companies and their Chinese
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ''This gives us a platform from which to arbitrate a dispute,''
said John Chen, chief executive officer of the software maker
Sybase Inc., which has sales of about $25 million a year in China.
''It really is a good vehicle, a good weapon for us.''
</P>
<P>
   At ITN, the trade deal promises to create more demand for the
company's matchmaking services. The company also sells Chinese-made
electronic components like TV tubes in Turkey and Europe and hopes
to start sales in the United States this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are tremendous opportunities in China,'' said S.R. Nair,
ITN's president. ''It's hard work. It's not easy, but making money
is never easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with a favorable trade agreement, making a profit in China
could be elusive for U.S. companies. Ultimately, their success will
hinge on Beijing keeping its promises after the trade deal goes
into effect.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's pretty easy to write down on paper the promise to do
something, but actually getting that implemented on the ground is
extremely difficult,'' said Greg Mastel, director of the global
economic policy project at the New America Foundation.

<HEADLINE> 'Dinosaur' Tops Box Office  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Ancient Rome conquered the box office for two
weekends. Now it's time for the prehistoric age to rule.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dinosaur,'' an animated tale about extinct reptiles, knocked
''Gladiator'' out of the arena with a $38.6 million weekend
opening, the best movie debut this year, according to studio
estimates Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The big premiere primes filmgoers for Memorial Day weekend, the
traditional start to the summer movie season. ''Dinosaur's'' reign
at the box office should be extinct by Wednesday, when Tom Cruise's
''Mission: Impossible 2'' opens.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gladiator'' slipped to No. 2 with $19.1 million, pushing its
gross to $102.5 million in 17 days. The Roman epic became the
second film released this year, after ''Erin Brockovich,'' to top
the $100 million mark.
</P>
<P>
   The raunchy campus comedy ''Road Trip,'' about a student on a
cross-country trek to retrieve a sex video mistakenly mailed to his
girlfriend, debuted at No. 3 with $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   Woody Allen made a rare appearance in the top 10 with ''Small
Time Crooks,'' which opened at No. 7 with $3.8 million. The
comedy's three-day take nearly equaled the $4.2 million total gross
of Allen's last film, ''Sweet and Lowdown,'' though that movie
never played wider than 239 theaters, while ''Small Time Crooks''
opened in 865.
</P>
<P>
   ''Small Time Crooks'' stars Allen and Tracey Ullman as a
low-class couple who try to pull a bank heist but come into riches
through unexpected means.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by Disney's ''Dinosaur,'' the weekend's top 12 films
grossed $101.2 million, down just $1 million from the same weekend
last year, when 1999's biggest movie, ''Star Wars: Episode I -- The
Phantom Menace,'' opened.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dinosaur'' beat the opening weekends for ''Gladiator'' and
''Scream 3,'' which both took in about $35 million in their first
three days.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a nice prelude to Memorial Day,'' said Paul
Dergarabedian, president of box-office tracker Exhibitor Relations.
''The momentum generated by all this moviegoing just keeps building
and creates more moviegoing.''
</P>
<P>
   Using computer-animated creatures set against real-world
landscapes, ''Dinosaur'' tells the story of the twilight of the
reptiles, who are on the run from devastation caused by a killer
meteor. The voice cast includes D.B. Sweeney, Alfre Woodard,
Julianna Margulies, Ossie Davis and Joan Plowright.
</P>
<P>
   The movie had the third biggest three-day opening for an
animated feature, after Disney's ''Toy Story 2'' with $57.4 million
last November and ''The Lion King'' with $40.9 million in June
1994.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dinosaur'' averaged a meteoric $11,851 per theater in 3,257
cinemas, compared with $6,281 in 3,041 theaters for ''Gladiator''
and $5,929 in 2,530 theaters for ''Road Trip.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess we all, from kids on up, have this love affair with
dinosaurs,'' said Chuck Viane, Disney's head of distribution. ''I'm
sure glad we depicted it in such a unique way that people really
want to come and see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North
American theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final
figures were to be released today.
</P>
<P>
   1. ''Dinosaur,'' $38.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   2. ''Gladiator,'' $19.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   3. ''Road Trip,'' $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   4. ''U-571,'' $4.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   5. ''Frequency,'' $4.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   6. ''Battlefield Earth,'' $3.83 million.
</P>
<P>
   7. ''Small Time Crooks,'' $3.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   8. ''Center Stage,'' $3.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   9. ''Where the Heart Is,'' $2.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   10. ''The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas,'' $2.5 million.

<HEADLINE> Lazio overcoming obscurity with whirlwind tour  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Rep. Rick Lazio knows he has a lot of ground to
cover to get his nascent Senate campaign up and running.
</P>
<P>
   So the Long Island Congressman hit the ground running Sunday in
a whirlwind tour, determined to overcome the biggest immediate
obstacle in his quest to beat Hillary Rodham Clinton: his own
obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio flew to Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse and Binghamton
Sunday, stopping for about 30 minutes in each town to rally support
for his Senate run. He planned to visit Elmira, Watertown, Utica,
Albany and Westchester today.
</P>
<P>
   Early on Sunday, Lazio appeared on six television talk shows and
gave the commencement address at a Long Island college.
</P>
<P>
   ''My challenge is to make sure that people know the real Rick
Lazio before the other side gets out and tries to fool the New York
people about who I am,'' Lazio said on CNN's ''Late Edition.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said he wasn't troubled by a new Zogby poll that showed
Clinton ahead, 46 percent to 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''I expect to be behind for a long time,'' Lazio told reporters
as he left the New York Institute of Technology in Old Westbury, on
Long Island. ''I expect to be the underdog throughout this race.''
</P>
<P>
   While upstate, Lazio told a condensed version of his life story,
introduced his wife and two daughters and credited his military
parents for instilling ''bedrock values'' of family, work and
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   He also promised to be a frequent visitor upstate, addressing a
concern of voters who complained they did not see enough of the
former Republican Senate candidate, New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who spent Sunday in Albany and Troy, scolded Lazio for
using his campaign announcement a day earlier to attack her as a
liberal carpetbagger with political ambitions beyond the U.S.
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was a little disappointed yesterday that my latest opponent
has already started hurling insults instead of offering ideas about
what we can do to improve the lives of New Yorkers,'' Clinton said.
''Every candidate has to make a decision about what kind of
campaign he or she will run. Will it be a campaign of ideas and
issues or a campaign of insults? ... I am sorry that my opponent
could not even get through his announcement speech without going on
the attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's campaign adviser Harold Ickes, campaign manager Bill
deBlasio and spokesman Howard Wolfson on Sunday's talk shows
portrayed Lazio as a lieutenant of Newt Gingrich and said his
support of the Contract with America was out of step with the
mainstream of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio defended his position rather than trying to distance
himself from it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know which one of the things on the Contract with
America that they are against,'' Lazio told ''Late Edition.'' ''Is
it the balanced budget? Is it lowering taxes? Is it a strong
national defense? If that's what they're against and I'm for, I'm
comfortable fighting on those grounds.''
</P>
<P>
   In the series of television interviews, Lazio sought to define
himself as ''just a plain old New Yorker'' -- native of Long Island,
son of an auto-parts dealer, married with two small children who
attend public school.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by ''Fox News Sunday'' if there were any skeletons in his
closet, like drug or health problems, he said: ''I'm clean as a
whistle.''

<HEADLINE> New Drug May Stop Cancer Growth  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- A new drug that focuses on the precise
genetic mutations that make cancer tumors different from healthy
tissue has shown promise in early tests on humans.
</P>
<P>
   The medicine, one of many in development that attempt to shift
cancer treatment away from a broad attack on all rapidly dividing
cells, helps halt the growth of tumors and makes them more
vulnerable to chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these new drugs attempt to interfere with tumors' use of
epidermal growth factor, one of the chemical signals that plays a
crucial role in their survival.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, researchers presented data on experimental use of one
of these drugs, code-named IMC-C225. The drug was discovered by Dr.
John Mendelsohn at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New
York City and is being developed by ImClone Systems Inc., which is
financing the research. Mendelsohn is now president of the
University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Although studies are still in early stages, the drug shows
potential in victims of colon cancer and head and neck cancer who
have failed standard treatments.
</P>
<P>
   By itself, the drug appears to make tumors stop growing. This,
in turn, leaves them open to the killing power of standard
chemotherapy drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a two-hit hypothesis,'' said Dr. Mark S. Rubin. ''The
one-two punch takes the cancer down.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say that almost every pharmaceutical company has drugs
in testing that are intended to stop tumor growth by exploiting
this and similar targets. The first drug in this category to reach
the market was Genentech's Herceptin, which was approved in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Both Herceptin and IMC-C225 are antibodies that block epidermal
growth factor receptors. These are spots on the cell that receive
chemical signals prompting them to divide. Because of a genetic
mutation, many cancer cells have extra copies of these receptors,
which help fuel their out-of-control growth.
</P>
<P>
   Herceptin blocks a growth factor receptor that is commonly found
on breast cancer cells, while IMC-C225 is aimed at one found on a
variety of other tumors.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin, who is in private practice in Bonito Springs, Fla., was
the first to test IMC-C225 against colon cancer. His first patient,
treated a year ago, had failed to respond to standard chemotherapy,
and her cancer had spread to her liver and abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   On a combination of IMC-C225 and the chemotherapy drug
Camptosar, the woman's spreading tumor shrank by 80 percent. The
remnants of her cancer were then surgically removed, and she now
appears well and free of all signs of the disease, although doctors
cannot say how long the remission will last.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at several hospitals plan to test the drug in 125 colon
cancer patients and in 98 with head and neck cancer. All have
cancer that has failed all standard treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel D. Waksal, ImClone's president, said the treatment
appears to have shrunk tumors by more than half in 12 patients with
head and neck cancer and eight with colon cancer. This represents
about 30 percent of the head and neck patients and 20 percent of
those with colon cancer who have taken the drug long enough to make
a difference.
</P>
<P>
   The company also plans to sponsor experiments with the drug in
victims of cancer of the pancreas, lung, ovaries and esophagus.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Abbruzzese of the University of Texas M. D. Anderson
Cancer Center in Houston is using the drug experimentally on
patients with pancreatic cancer, which is especially difficult to
treat. He said that while doctors are enthusiastic about the
potential of this approach, he cautioned: ''It's very preliminary.
We don't want to overstate what we are seeing until we have an
adequate amount of follow up time.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Dr. Lori Goldstein of the Fox Chase Cancer Center
in Philadelphia predicted that most cancer studies will soon
involve similar treatments that go after the specific genetic
disruptions that cause cancer to grow out of control.
</P>
<P>
   ''The hope is to characterize each tumor with DNA analysis to
target the therapy directly,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Rebels Free More Hostages  </HEADLINE>
By TIM SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Rebels in Sierra Leone have set
free 54 more U.N. captives after holding them hostage for nearly
three weeks, a U.N. official said.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeepers were handed over to Liberian custody in the
border town of Foya on Sunday and flown by helicopter to Liberia's
capital of Monrovia, said U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst. They were
brought to Freetown by plane a few hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the group looked thin and weak as they walked off the
plane. Three injured Kenyans among those released were taken away
in an ambulance. Officials did not say how they were hurt. Wimhurst
said several of the freed hostages were suffering from malaria.
</P>
<P>
   Those released Sunday included seven other Kenyans, 42 Zambians,
one Malaysian and one Norwegian, Wimhurst said.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel Revolutionary United Front has now freed 204 of some
500 U.N. peacekeepers it seized in early May. The reason behind
Sunday's release was not immediately clear.
</P>
<P>
   A U.N. peacekeeping official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the freed hostages had been ''reasonably treated,''
though there was little food or medicine in the dense Sierra
Leonean bush where they had been held.
</P>
<P>
   One former captive, 57-year-old Naval Cmdr. Knut Gjellestacj, a
Norwegian military observer, said he was happy to be free.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thank everybody in Norway for all their good thoughts,''
said Gjellestacj, who was captured May 1 while trying to secure the
release of U.N. colleagues who had been seized in the central town
of Makeni.
</P>
<P>
   The release came as pro-government forces advanced Sunday toward
a rebel-held town that would position them to make a push against a
key rebel stronghold, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-government forces, including members of the army, former
junta soldiers and militiamen composed of traditional hunters known
as the Kamajors, were fighting their way toward Lunsar, 50 miles
northeast of Sierra Leone's capital Freetown, said two top military
officials, who spoke on condition their names not be used.
</P>
<P>
   They declined to give further details, and their account could
not be independently confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   From Lunsar, the military would be well-placed to launch an
attack on Makeni, an important rebel stronghold.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 10 days, government forces have been slowly
pushing the rebels back from the Freetown area and out of a number
of other important towns.
</P>
<P>
   The counterattack followed a rebel offensive that brought them
within 40 miles of Freetown, part of a resurgence in Sierra Leone's
civil conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have not launched any major attacks in recent days,
and it was not clear who has been leading them since rebel chief
Foday Sankoh was seized on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah is seeking to push ahead with a
peace accord signed last year. However, the rebels remain
well-armed in their jungle bases. They have demanded Sankoh's
release, but the government has refused.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. contingent now numbers 10,400, the largest U.N.
peacekeeping deployment in the world, and has been authorized to
grow to 13,000.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, U.S. envoy Jesse Jackson denounced the ''terror
tactics'' of the rebels and called on them to release the
peacekeepers immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ''The RUF must disarm voluntarily, and immediately, or be made
to disarm involuntarily,'' Jackson said Saturday at a news
conference in neighboring Liberia.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, acting as President Clinton's special envoy, is touring
West Africa in a bid to calm tensions in Sierra Leone and win the
freedom of the peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said Saturday that he had not yet decided whether he
would go to Sierra Leone. He was traveling to Mali and Guinea over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh, widely reviled for his role in the country's brutal
civil war, was captured as he walked toward his Freetown home --
which he had fled May 8 when his fighters fired on a crowd of
demonstrators, killing 19.
</P>
<P>
   The government has said it is investigating the shooting, and
has not yet decided what to do with the rebel chief.

<HEADLINE> Ex-IU Player Claims Abuse by Knight  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Former Indiana University basketball
player Chris Lawson made another allegation of abuse against
Hoosiers coach Bob Knight.
</P>
<P>
   Lawson, who played at Indiana from 1989-91 before transferring
to Vanderbilt, told The Tennessean for its Monday editions that he
saw Knight punch another player in the head at halftime of a game.
</P>
<P>
   Knight also pelted Lawson with basketballs from close range one
day during practice, berated his assistant coaches and was verbally
abusive to players, Lawson said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawson, who grew up in Bloomington, Ind., currently is a
pharmaceutical salesman in Salina, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations come on the heels of an IU investigation into a
claim Knight choked player Neil Reed during a 1997 practice.
Several of Reed's IU teammates said his claims were unfounded --
until a videotape of the incident surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   Knight was suspended last Monday for three regular-season games
and fined $30,000 by the university.
</P>
<P>
   Lawson, 29, said he was never contacted during the investigation
and didn't come forward because he feared being made a pariah, just
as Reed was.
</P>
<P>
   In his most serious charge, Lawson said Knight struck a player
in the side of the head with a closed fist during halftime of a
Dec. 21, 1990, game at Iowa State. The players were seated in the
locker room when the incident took place.
</P>
<P>
   Lawson refused to identify the player, saying only ''he was
another big guy'' on the team, and the player hasn't come forward
himself because of fear he'd be vilified.
</P>
<P>
   ''He screwed up in the game, and at halftime Coach actually
punched him in the head. It was a punch on the side of his head,''
Lawson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The same guy, in practice when he would make a mistake, Coach
Knight would grab his shorts and kick him as hard as he could in
the butt, and after practice there would be bruises and stuff,''
Lawson told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   When contacted by The Tennessean, Matt Nover, a 6-foot-9 forward
on that team, acknowledged he remembers a ''heated situation'' at
halftime of the Iowa State game between himself and Knight.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was not hurt by the man, and I don't think I was ever
abused,'' Nover said when asked about specifics. ''He never struck
me with his fist.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether Knight struck him using an open hand, Nover
replied: ''I've made my statement. You know, the man was intense.
He got in our faces, and that was his way of motivating us.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whatever happened in that locker room was between all of us,''
Nover said. ''... He was upset with me like he has been with
players in 1,000 games before, and like any other coach would be
with any other player who was playing bad and not doing what he was
supposed to do.
</P>
<P>
   ''In no way was I abused or hurt. He let me know that I was
making mistakes, and we went back on the floor and continued to
play the game,'' Nover added.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm amazed that the media continues this direction with these
sensational stories, day after day, after day, after day,'' said
university spokesman Christopher Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   Knight currently is on a golfing trip in Scotland, according to
Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Reynolds, a 1993 Indiana graduate who played in the game
at Iowa State, said he never witnessed Knight punching a player.

Atlantic City, N.J., crashed in a ball of fire. There were no survivors. Fiery
wreckage was spotted in some woods about 9 miles south of the
Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport in northeastern Pennsylvania. It
appeared that both of the chartered turbo prop's engines failed, said Federal
Aviation Administration spokeswoman Tammy Jones. The plane missed its first
landing approach and crashed on its second attempt, said George Black of the
National Transportation Safety Board.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Labor markets will remain tight this summer, with demand for
workers climbing to record heights as more than a third of American companies
anticipate hiring new employees, a new survey reports. In a survey of 16,000
companies, being released today by the temporary staffing agency Manpower Inc.,
35 percent said they plan to expand their work force in the third quarter, while
just 5 percent anticipated cutbacks. Fifty-five percent forecast no change and 5
percent were uncertain. Overall, hiring is expected to increase 9 percent from
the previous quarter, when 32 percent of respondents reported the need to
recruit.

Shuttle Astronauts Fix Broken Equipment
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Two spacewalking astronauts fixed broken
equipment Sunday night on the outside of the international space station, flying
united with the shuttle Atlantis. It was the shuttle crew's second 200-mile-high
feat of the day. The first was the impeccable shuttle-station linkup. Jeffrey
Williams and James Voss emerged from Atlantis a little early. The 5-foot
construction crane was installed on the space station by another pair of
spacewalkers last spring. But it was never locked properly into its socket,
allowing it to swivel back and forth. Williams and Voss removed the crane from
its socket, then pushed it back in tight with a twist. They tugged at it, and it
was no longer wobbling.

U.S. Cigarette Exports Drop
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans are rejecting the smoking habit at a
surprisingly rapid rate, a trend that is going global. But there are signs of
increased smoking in poor countries and among teen-agers and young women in
several countries, and deaths blamed on smoking still are rising worldwide. U.S.
cigarette exports are down 25 percent, with 50 billion fewer cigarettes sent
abroad in just one year. That is 2.5 billion fewer packs of cigarettes exported
each year. The number of cigarettes sold per person in the United States fell a
record 8 percent last year, according to government data and to a Worldwatch
analysis that also cites per-capita declines in some of the heaviest smoking
countries: France, Japan and, markedly, China, whose 1.25 billion people now
smoke one-third of the world's cigarettes.

   LONDON (AP) -- A British tabloid has recovered a stolen military laptop
believed to contain details of a fighter plane being developed jointly by the
United States and Britain, authorities confirmed Sunday. The Mirror, which
returned the computer to the Ministry of Defense, reportedly recovered the
laptop in a sting operation after being contacted by an unidentified computer
specialist who was given the computer and asked to delete ''fighter plane
stuff'' from its memory. The computer expert saw that the information was
sensitive and contacted the tabloid. The Mirror said in its Monday edition that
it secretly switched the stolen computer for another and handed it over to
authorities on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Haitians Vote for New Government  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL NORTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Haitians have voted peacefully in
massive numbers for the first time in years -- a cry for democracy
by a people defying fears of violence at the polls and a history of
persecution.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a tremendous victory for the Haitian people,'' said
U.S. Congressman John Conyers, a Democrat from Michigan who was
observing Sunday's vote.
</P>
<P>
   There were no official participation figures, but Conyers
estimated that up to 60 percent of the 4 million-member electorate
voted.
</P>
<P>
   Despite widespread relief at the relative peace, hundreds of
thousands of people were unable to vote because of alleged
technical difficulties that opposition leaders claimed were
evidence of fraud by the dominant Lavalas Party.
</P>
<P>
   The results will not be known for days because of a primitive
and meticulous counting process. After polling stations closed late
Sunday, officials counted ballots by candlelight and then
painstakingly read the results of each ballot paper, squinting to
read and displaying each slip for a crowd to behold.
</P>
<P>
   Some 29,490 candidates were contesting 7,625 posts in the
legislature, mayoral commissions, and local and rural councils.
Runoff elections are scheduled June 25 for legislative contests
where no candidate wins more than 50 percent of votes.
</P>
<P>
   Most voters interviewed said they were choosing candidates of
Lavalas supported by former president Jean-Betrand Aristide, the
charismatic and controversial former slum priest who remains the
pivotal figure in Haitian politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''Aristide is going to give us jobs,'' said Wilbert Genty, an
unemployed 23-year-old. ''Aristide is our father. The people he
told us to vote for can only be good people.''
</P>
<P>
   Voters began lining up at dawn Sunday and were kept waiting for
hours at many balloting stations. Electoral officials said
unspecified security concerns delayed the distribution of voter
rolls and ballot papers.
</P>
<P>
   Some stations never opened, prompting brief protests and leaving
hundreds of thousands unable to vote; officials postponed voting by
200,000 people in southern Grand Anse district to a future date,
citing ''technical difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leader Gerard-Pierre Charles condemned the
difficulties as ''sabotage'' to prevent opposition supporters from
voting.
</P>
<P>
   Even as electoral council president Leon Manus expressed his joy
and said ''the country welcomed the end of the day with calm,
serenity, and perhaps a kind of happiness,'' a police radio
frequency scanned at an Internet cafe was reporting that cars
without license plates were transporting stolen ballot boxes.
</P>
<P>
   The electoral council told reporters late Sunday that police
were investigating reports that a red pickup truck had been
stealing voting materials.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was massive fraud,'' said opposition senatorial
candidate Marie-Laurence Lassegue. ''People were allowed to vote
without voting cards, people were arrested with ballot boxes
stuffed with votes. Police arrested people illegally carrying
ballot boxes away from poll stations (and) some opposition party
monitors were barred from balloting stations.''
</P>
<P>
   Lassegue said Lavalas opponents would ask for the elections to
be annulled on Gonave Island, where opposition parties boycotted
the vote, charging that all poll officials were exclusively Lavalas
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative and local elections in Haiti, delayed four times in
the past two years, would install a constitutional parliament to
replace the legislature disbanded in January 1999 by President Rene
Preval in a prolonged power struggle triggered by fraudulent
legislative elections in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Such a parliament could approve a government, which would almost
certainly free a half billion dollars in foreign aid that is badly
needed in a country where 65 percent of the work force is
unemployed, those with work earn an average of $350 a year, and 80
percent of the people go hungry.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning was marred by at least 15 politically related
slayings since March 27, arson attacks on opposition offices and
rumors that violence would erupt at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were scared,'' said voter Micheline Blaise. ''But we
overcame our fears. We have to vote because we have to have change
in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking safety in numbers, the unemployed 50-year-old mother of
two came with a group of friends to join more than 100 voters lined
up along a stinking drain running with sewage in Cite Soleil, where
500,000 people live beside pigs and goats rooting in garbage.
</P>
<P>
   There were two reported fatalities; a police officer killed by
supporters of a candidate arrested on fraud charges and the man who
killed the policeman, shot by police.
</P>
<P>
   Aristide was constitutionally barred from serving consecutive
terms and hand-picked Preval as his successor. But few doubt that
Aristide, whose fiery rhetoric helped inspire the overthrow of the
29-year Duvalier dictatorship in 1986, will win presidential
elections planned for November.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's election was a test of whether his popularity could
carry lesser-known candidates and produce a Parliament of Lavalas
loyalists.

<HEADLINE> Ralph Nader brings '60s activism to the 2000 campaign trail  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Running for president isn't much of a leap for
Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's most famous consumer activist has been campaigning
all his life, crusading since the 1960s for auto safety, clean air,
universal health care and a slew of other causes. Now he's jumped
into the Bush-Gore fray, seizing the chance to play his favorite
public role, thorn in the big guys' sides.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here's who I'm running against -- the Bush corporation and the
Gore corporation,'' Nader said in a recent interview. ''These guys
are proxies for a corporate takeover of the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader is seeking the Green Party presidential nomination and
hopes to pull in the 5 percent of the vote needed to guarantee
federal matching funds for the party in 2004. He expects to be on
the ballot in at least 45 states and says he wants his campaign to
spur Americans to activism.
</P>
<P>
   The 66-year-old Harvard-educated lawyer made his name as a
consumer advocate in 1965, when he published ''Unsafe At Any
Speed,'' a stinging critique of the auto industry that helped
prompt a federal law mandating seat belts.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he's devoted himself almost single-mindedly to
battling what he sees as corporate domination of American life.
Marching under the banner of increased power for consumers and
citizens, he's fought for tougher environmental rules, government
openness, job safety, auto air bags and restrictions on lobbyists'
power, among scores of other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Nader, whose close-cropped salt-and-pepper hair makes his
serious demeanor seem even more intense, has never married or had
children and is said by supporters to barely have a personal life.
Nearly all his energy has gone to his public crusades.
</P>
<P>
   His name has appeared on presidential ballots twice before, but
this is his most serious race. He was a write-in candidate in the
1992 New Hampshire primary. In 1996, the Greens put his name on
presidential ballots, but he hardly campaigned and received less
than 1 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes this bid will rouse Americans to take back a government
he believes has been sold outright to business interests.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to bring thousands of people ... into progressive
political activism,'' Nader said, leaning his lanky frame forward
over an office conference table. ''The key issue in this country
right now is whether we're going to have a democracy that places
the sovereignty of the people over the sovereignty of big
business.''
</P>
<P>
   That message may be a tough sell in a dot-com age, when many
young people seem more interested in stock options than political
action. But Nader believes that outside the ''contented classes''
at the top of the income pyramid, most Americans want a candidate
who'll shake up the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   ''This message appeals to everybody who has a basic sense of
justice, who wants the country to move forward for all the
people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nader's public profile peaked in the 1960s and '70s, when he
mentored the hundreds of young activists known as Nader's Raiders,
testified frequently before Congress and appeared on television
with investigations into corporate abuses.
</P>
<P>
   But in a political world that's moved well to the right since
then, his voice has gotten a lot lonelier.
</P>
<P>
   ''He gets the good, solid activist vote, but it ain't much,''
said Maurice Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac College Polling
Institute in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   That's OK with Nader, who doesn't harbor serious hopes of taking
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of ways to define winning, and one of them is
building,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also scoffs at suggestions that by challenging Vice President
Al Gore on the left he'll help tip the election to Texas Gov.
George Bush. Nader said the Democrats long ago betrayed the liberal
ideals they once espoused, and he believes it makes little
difference which party is elected.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you want to legitimize with your vote the least worst
choice ... then you are basically chaining yourself to both parties
getting worse every four years,'' Nader said.
</P>
<P>
   In states where one of the two major candidates seems to have a
clear lock, Nader added, liberal Democrats can vote for him without
worrying that they might help send Bush to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   A recent CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll showed Nader and
ultra-conservative Reform Party hopeful Pat Buchanan each drawing
support from 4 percent of likely voters.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Miringoff, of Marist College's Institute for Public Opinion,
said Nader could benefit from voters' recent interest in renegade
candidates like Republican John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ''In certain states there can be an impact on Gore, and that's
something to be watched,'' Miringoff said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's signature issue, campaign finance reform, is also
central to Nader's agenda. He's raised about $600,000 for his own
effort so far and is aiming for $5 million, including federal
matching funds. He's also asking supporters to pledge hours to
volunteer with the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''The concept is citizen time will cancel out business bucks on
the other side,'' he explained. ''I want people to feel like we're
running with them, not parading in front of them.''

<HEADLINE> Von Trier Film Wins Palme d'Or  </HEADLINE>
By CLAR NI CHONGHAILE
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANNES, France (AP) -- Danish director Lars von Trier and singer
Bjork celebrated joint triumphs and a truce after ''Dancer in the
Dark'' won the Palme d'Or in Cannes and the best actress award for
the Icelandic musician.
</P>
<P>
   After much talk of on-set tension between the unorthodox
director and his feisty leading lady, the two hugged to a standing
ovation Sunday at the film festival awards ceremony in the French
Riviera city.
</P>
<P>
   It was also a good night for Asian cinema, with the second-place
Grand Prize going to Chinese director Jiang Wen for ''Devils on the
Doorstep,'' a tragic yet funny tale about a Chinese village during
the Japanese occupation in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Best actor went to Hong Kong's Tony Leung for his role as a
cheated-on husband who embarks on his own affair in Wong Kar-wai's
''In the Mood for Love,'' while best director went to Taiwan's
Edward Yang for ''Yi Yi'' (A One and a Two).
</P>
<P>
   But all eyes were on Bjork and von Trier, whose well-publicized
feud sent a gossipy frisson through the 12-day festival.
</P>
<P>
   Von Trier punched the air as he accepted his award from French
legend Catherine Deneuve, who also starred in the movie -- easily
the most controversial film here this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dancer in the Dark'' tells the tale of Selma, a Czech
immigrant working in rural America in the 1960s. She is slowly
going blind and desperately saving to pay for an operation for her
son, who also risks losing his sight.
</P>
<P>
   But fate conspires against her and after a neighbor steals her
savings, she finds herself swept up in a horrific nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Critics were divided into those who loved the melodramatic tale
and those who hated it. The public was mainly interested in the
reported feuding, confirmed by von Trier -- who said before the
awards that the shooting had been ''terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   What a difference a prize makes.
</P>
<P>
   At the post-awards news conference, Bjork giggled and playfully
punched von Trier, who was glowing happily.
</P>
<P>
   Bjork admitted the filming had been tough, and displayed an
eerie affinity with her character, whose only comfort in a cruel
world is her passion for classic Hollywood musicals.
</P>
<P>
   The 34-year-old singer said music was her escape from the real
world, while acting brought reality back into focus.
</P>
<P>
   ''The film was very painful to do and all my records have been
very joyful ... it took me a while to get used to the suffering,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The rush of winning the prize made her forget all the pain. ''It
is a very, good magic potion you have here in Cannes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bjork's raw, emotional performance may have drained her, but it
won rave reviews and left many viewers in tears.
</P>
<P>
   No stranger to Cannes, von Trier won the Grand Prize for his
wrenching love story ''Breaking the Waves'' in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Among other awards was a special mention for the entire cast of
Pavel Lounguine's ''The Wedding,'' a lively tale of a boisterous
marriage in a Russian mining town.
</P>
<P>
   Iranian cinema garnered a clutch of awards. The jury prize was
tied between 20-year-old Samira Makhmalbaf of Iran for
''Blackboards and ''Songs from the Second Floor,'' by Swedish
director Roy Andersson, his first film in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   And the Golden Camera award for first-time director was given to
two Iranians, also in a tie: Hassan Yektapanah for ''Djomeh'' and
Bahman Ghobadi for ''A Time for Drunken Horses.''
</P>
<P>
   Best screenplay went to ''Nurse Betty,'' a dark, funny film
directed by Neil LaBute and written by John C. Richards and James
Flamberg. It was the only American film honored in the main
competition.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate competition, the star-studded ''Things You Can
Tell Just By Looking at Her,'' featuring Glenn Close, Cameron Diaz,
Holly Hunter and Calista Flockhart was the winner. The film was
directed by Rodrigo Garcia, the son of the celebrated Colombian
author Gabriel Garcia Marquez.
</P>
<P>
   The jury, headed by French director Luc Besson, ignored several
critically acclaimed films, including Liv Ullmann's ''Faithless,''
Joel and Ethan Coen's ''O Brother, Where Art Thou,'' and Aoyama
Shinji's nearly four-hour, black-and-white ''Eureka.''

<HEADLINE> Satellite ERs Saving Emergency Care  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA A. JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- It's an emergency endangering many American
hospitals: With shorter patient stays and a surge in outpatient
treatment, more and more of the nation's 840,000 hospital beds stay
empty.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, exacerbated by shrinking reimbursements and rising
technology and labor costs, has put hundreds of hospitals on life
support. Many executives and trustees reluctantly are concluding
the only cure is to cut vacant beds and acute-care services,
killing emergency medical care.
</P>
<P>
   So New Jersey, with its hefty surplus of beds, is encouraging
hospitals closing -- or converting acute-care wards into outpatient
clinics or rehabilitation or diagnostic centers -- to keep open
''satellite'' emergency rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do believe we're rather unique in the country ... in trying
to create this step-down ER, if you will, to allow communities
where a hospital is closing to retain emergency services,'' said
Marilyn Dahl, New Jersey's head of health planning and regulation.
''In some states, hospitals just close.''
</P>
<P>
   The satellite emergency rooms must be part of a system with
nearby acute-care hospitals. They will be required to have staff
and equipment to handle about 90 percent of typical emergency room
cases, and stabilize patients requiring transfer elsewhere.
Ambulance squads will go straight to a full-service hospital with
any patients requiring hospital admission.
</P>
<P>
   At least four hospitals or health care systems in the state
already are pursuing such arrangements. The state is requiring some
to do so, drafting regulations for the new emergency rooms, even
creating a debt relief fund for some hospitals making the
transition. A health department advisory board voted last week to
publish the draft rules for public comment.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just the opposite of ''Not In My Back Yard'' -- everybody
wants it,'' said George Gennaoui, spokesman for South Jersey Health
System.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals closing has become such a problem in rural communities
that the federal government four years ago created new regulations
with a more-generous reimbursement structure for ''critical access
hospitals.'' The facilities, which must be at least 35 miles from a
major hospital, switch their focus to primary care but maintain an
emergency department and a few short-term beds.
</P>
<P>
   There's already about 110 of them around the country and another
300 of the nation's 6,000 hospitals may convert soon, said Kurt
Patton of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare
Organizations. He thinks the conversion trend will slowly increase,
but said New Jersey's approach is unique.
</P>
<P>
   With the state aiming to eliminate excess acute-care beds so New
Jersey's many financially strapped hospitals can recover, Gov.
Christie Whitman has proposed an $8 million fund to help hospitals
closing acute-care services reduce bond debt. Just last November, a
commission on the future of hospitals issued a report recommending
30 percent to 50 percent of New Jersey's 25,620 acute-care beds be
closed.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty years ago, New Jersey had more than 51,000 hospital beds.
That dropped to 31,264 by 1984 and keeps declining due to
managed-care pressures, the advent of minimally invasive surgery,
more home care services and other health care changes.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, Memorial Medical Center at South Amboy abruptly
closed amid mounting financial losses. A citizens committee and a
new chief executive officer, Jim Monahan, campaigned to reopen it.
Under an agreement reached with the state allowing it to reopen but
not as a provider of acute care, Monahan said Memorial is
negotiating with another hospital to help run a satellite emergency
room and possibly other services.
</P>
<P>
   Such arrangements may quiet community opposition to change, but
hospital donors, volunteers, and staff members losing their jobs
may remain angry, conceded Jean Marshall, a Meridian Health System
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, it closed acute-care services at one of its four
Shore-area hospitals and -- under state orders -- converted Point
Pleasant Hospital to New Jersey's first satellite emergency room.
It meets proposed regulations for such operations, even though it
will be months before they are finalized.

<HEADLINE> 'Millionaire' Stresses TV Execs  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Leslie Moonves probably wasn't counting sheep to
fall asleep last week. More likely, the top CBS executive was
playing an image of Regis Philbin over and over.
</P>
<P>
   Final answer? Final answer? FINAL ANSWER?
</P>
<P>
   A pleasant dream for ABC, a nightmare for Moonves and other
networks' executives, ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' thoroughly
dominated the networks' planning for a new fall season. The
schedules were announced last week to advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   ABC had to decide how many times to air the game show each week,
before settling on an unprecedented four hours. Rivals had to guess
when it would air and how to combat it, knowing that direct
competition was certain suicide for all but the strongest shows.
</P>
<P>
   ''I lay awake at night thinking how to fight this thing,''
Moonves said, ''and I don't have the answer yet. It's driving me
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the schedules marked a fervent wish by everyone not
at ABC that the bubble burst and things get back to normal.
Networks stuck to the traditional fare of scripted comedies and
dramas. There were no ''Millionaire'' imitators, no new ''reality''
shows and fewer hours of newsmagazines.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Kellner, chief executive of the WB, said ''Millionaire''
was partly to blame for his network's decline this year.
</P>
<P>
   But he offered a hopeful story he recalled from his childhood:
Buddy was one of the most unpopular children in the neighborhood
until he got a hula hoop. Everybody wanted to be his friend. He'd
make everyone pay a few cents to use the hula hoop and time them to
make sure no one cheated. Eventually, all the other kids got their
own hula hoops and wouldn't talk to him again.
</P>
<P>
   ''Six months later, all of us put the hula hoops in the garage
and forgot about them,'' Kellner said. ''You can take whatever you
want from that little story.''
</P>
<P>
   No one expects Philbin to disappear in six months. But the past
few weeks have proven ''Millionaire'' isn't unbeatable. The
mini-series ''Jesus'' and the season finale of ''Frasier'' both
outrated the game show.
</P>
<P>
   With the average age of the ''Millionaire'' audience creeping
past 50, NBC believes the best way to fight is with a show that
appeals to a younger audience. That's partly why it is shifting
''Will &AMP; Grace'' to Thursdays, replacing ''Frasier.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS is airing its most promising new comedy, starring Bette
Midler, opposite ''Millionaire'' on Wednesday hoping curious
viewers will tune in.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most difficult part was waiting to see where they would
put 'Millionaire,''' Moonves said. ''It's a force of nature.
Hopefully, they will put on so much of them that they will blow
themselves out.''
</P>
<P>
   The networks have given up trying to ride the quiz show's
coattails. Two game shows -- CBS's ''Winning Lines'' and NBC's
''Twenty One'' -- have already come and gone. The last remaining
prime-time quiz, Fox's ''Greed,'' was left off the fall schedule.
</P>
<P>
   NBC prefers to make traditional entertainment shows with a
script, said Scott Sassa, the network's West Coast president.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is what they do best and it is their biggest advantage over
cable,'' said Steve Sternberg, a senior partner at the advertising
firm TN Media. ''They have the money to produce these shows and the
experience to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   With newsmagazine ratings weakening due to overexposure, the
networks are cutting back. There will be three ''Dateline NBC''
editions next season, instead of five, and ABC went from four to
three newsmagazines.
</P>
<P>
   For many of the 16 new comedies, networks are hoping one
personality can carry the day: CBS has ''The Bette Show,'' ABC has
''Geena'' with Geena Davis, former ''Seinfeld'' actor Michael
Richards has an NBC sitcom, and Fox promises ''Schimmel,'' with
standup comedian Robert Schimmel.
</P>
<P>
   The networks' creative pendulum has swung largely to dramas;
seven of Fox's nine new programs fit the hour-long drama format.
</P>
<P>
   Although the traditional police and medical dramas are
represented, the genre is remarkably varied -- there are shows about
teachers, Wall Street executives and reporters, a remake of the
classic series ''The Fugitive,'' and edgy horror and science
fiction fare.
</P>
<P>
   When the cast of NBC's freshman hit ''The West Wing'' was
introduced at a sales meeting last week, advertisers gave the
actors a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's one of the things we liked about 'The West Wing,'''
said Mike Greco, of the advertising firm BBDO Worldwide. ''It
offered viewers an hour format that was something different.''
</P>
<P>
   After being criticized for the lack of minorities in upcoming
shows last summer, networks were more conscious of diversity. ABC
is making Andre Braugher the star of a drama, and ensemble casts
have more minority actors.
</P>
<P>
   CBS acknowledged that it kept ''City of Angels,'' a doctor drama
with a largely black cast, on the air partly because of the
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The opportunity to grab a larger audience is good news for the
cast. The bad news? ''City of Angels'' is airing directly opposite
''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''

<HEADLINE> Mild Brain Injuries Studied  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW FORDAHL
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Even mild head injuries result in major
changes to the brain's metabolism and could make victims
susceptible to more serious damage from a repeated blow, according
to a study being released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The findings raise concerns about sending athletes back to the
field or drivers to the road within minutes of any head injury,
said Dr. Marvin Bergsneider, a study author and neurologist at the
University of California, Los Angeles Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is the risk of putting a quarterback back into a football
game if he's been knocked unconscious just 20 minutes before?'' he
said. ''This study implies it may be risky to do that because the
brain isn't functioning normally metabolically.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors typically assess brain injuries by asking victims simple
questions and performing MRI and CT scans, which show the structure
of the brain.
</P>
<P>
   For this study, researchers performed positron emission
tomography (PET) scans on 42 patients in the aftermath of a
concussion. PET scans reveal how the brain is functioning by
measuring its use of glucose, the fuel of brain cells.
</P>
<P>
   The UCLA researchers found no difference in the PET scans of
comatose patients with head injuries and those who were awake.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even though a person may appear normal, alert and able to
talk, what occurs inside the person's brain is anything but
normal,'' said researcher David Hovda, director of the UCLA Brain
Injury Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   The study is published in the May issue of Neurotrauma.
</P>
<P>
   Further research is needed to determine how long the lower use
of glucose persists after an injury and to fully understand the
effects. Patients in the UCLA study were found to be normal six
months after the injury.
</P>
<P>
   Previous animal studies have shown that the depressed level of
glucose use can make a patient vulnerable to more severe damage
after a repeated blow.
</P>
<P>
   The study confirms something long suspected by doctors who treat
people with head injuries, said Dr. Gregory O'Shanick, national
medical director of the Brain Injury Association.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know just because people are walkie-talkies -- because they
can walk and talk -- that that's not the full story,'' he said.
''Many people blow that off as being innocuous. What this indicates
is that clearly it's not.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who suffers a head trauma should think twice before
resuming normal activities immediately after the injury, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Treat concussion as a sprain on the brain,'' O'Shanick said.
''You don't run on a sprained ankle immediately. You go back into
exercise slowly -- it's the same thing with concussive injuries.''

<HEADLINE> 'Ally' Tunes Up With Randy Newman  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Gotta sing, gotta dance. On ''Ally McBeal,''
there's no order in the courtroom when the music cranks up.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Ally'' attorneys cannot resist a musical interlude.
Through three years, they've warbled tunes at work, boogied along
with their shrink, and dueted with the likes of Al Green and Barry
White.
</P>
<P>
   That's not enough for series creator David E. Kelley, who
insistently pushes television's boundaries with his risky and
risque series about Boston lawyers. For the season finale (9 p.m.
EDT Monday on Fox), Kelley has devised a virtual pop operetta.
</P>
<P>
   The hour-long show uses a dozen songs from Randy Newman,
including one original number, ''Forever,'' along with a tune from
Madonna and two songs -- honest -- from ''The Music Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley is a fan of Newman, whose mastery of catchy and satirical
melodies (''Short People,'' ''I Love L.A.'') is matched by his
ability to create emotionally charged movie scores (''The Natural''
among them).
</P>
<P>
   Newman, in turn, is a fan of Kelley's work. The prodigious
Kelley, who executive produces and writes both ''Ally McBeal'' and
the ABC drama ''The Practice,'' is the Joyce Carol Oates of
television, in the songwriter's estimation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't think of anybody else to compare him to, the amount of
work he does,'' Newman said. ''He's the real thing, and I'm honored
that he chose to use my songs to the extent that he did.''
</P>
<P>
   The way in which ''Ally McBeal'' incorporates music this time
around runs counter to the standard approach, says Bill D'Elia, who
was brought in recently as an executive producer and directed the
season finale.
</P>
<P>
   D'Elia, director of a 1997 song-and-dance hour of ''Chicago
Hope,'' another Kelley series, said that was akin to a classic
movie musical in which a tune stops the action. ''Ally McBeal,''
however, treads ground broken by the British miniseries ''The
Singing Detective.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Characters start to sing what they were saying, and it moves
the comedy or drama along as it would have had they been
speaking,'' D'Elia said.
</P>
<P>
   The approach flopped for the clever but short-lived 1990 series
''Cop Rock,'' which also happened to feature Newman's work, but
D'Elia believes ''Ally'' viewers are attuned to Kelley's siren song
of inventiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ''People have come to expect a lot of music on this, and David
just took it to another level,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the storylines Monday: Ally (Calista Flockhart) pursues a
new relationship, Nell (Portia de Rossi) considers coming back to
the firm she just dumped and John Cage (Peter MacNicol)
contemplates his 36th birthday with despair.
</P>
<P>
   James Naughton and Jill Clayburgh return as Ally's parents, and
Alicia Witt (''Cybill'') is on hand again as temptress and
tormentor to Richard Fish (Greg Germann).
</P>
<P>
   So who does sing? Just about everybody, says D'Elia. And who CAN
sing? Just about everybody, he insists.
</P>
<P>
   ''Peter MacNicol can sing, and he sings well. He sounds like
Paul Simon,'' said D'Elia. ''I swear. You're laughing at me, and I
would have laughed at you if you told me.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lisa Nicole (Carson) and Jane (Krakowski) can sing,'' he
continued. ''Lisa has a knockout of a voice, and Jane has a real
song-and-dance number.''
</P>
<P>
   Germann, who plays bad-boy attorney Fish -- he can sing?
</P>
<P>
   ''Greg Germann can sell it. He can sell it,'' D'Elia said,
diplomatically. ''There are two ways to sing a song: You can carry
it or you can sell it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a nice way to put it. I guess,'' responded Germann,
good-naturedly. ''I think I sort of do my best Rex Harrison.''
</P>
<P>
   Emulating the approach taken by non-singer Harrison in ''My Fair
Lady,'' Germann warbles the Newman tune ''You Can't Keep a Good Man
Down'' to MacNicol.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a perverse way, I was pleased I got the shot (to sing),''
Germann said. ''There is the other side of it, total fear. But that
only comes later, because we end up being so busy that it's not
until it's over that you say 'What have I done?'''
</P>
<P>
   If the cast was tested by Kelley's concept, Newman found it a
breeze. He even played himself in one scene.
</P>
<P>
   ''He showed up at 7:30, left at 10:30,'' D'Elia recalled. ''When
he was saying goodbye, he stepped up and said, 'Thank you. It's
been a long and difficult season.'''
</P>
<P>
   There was, Newman admitted, one trying aspect: the
slimmer-than-thou look of several cast members.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was probably the fattest person ever on their show,'' Newman
said, just a sliver of mirth in his voice. ''They told me, you're
the fattest person we've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   So the free eats typically provided cast and crew were absent?
''There's food,'' he said. ''Parsley, watercress, all the
legumes.''

<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A party of University at Albany graduates
was evacuated from a downtown restaurant Sunday as police searched
for an armed robber who got away with an estimated $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   Police say the robber, described as a black male, 5'4'' tall and
20 years old, approached an employee as she entered the third floor
business office of Jillian's, a restaurant and bar.
</P>
<P>
   The robber reportedly pointed a small caliber gun at the woman,
who complied with his demand to open the safe. Police say the
robber then tied the woman's hands behinds her back and taped her
upper body to a chair before escaping.
</P>
<P>
   Police Sunday were looking for the suspect, last seen wearing a

<HEADLINE> Arizona Senator John McCain challenges Colgate grads to ''be patriots'' </HEADLINE>
By JOHN KEKIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMILTON, N.Y. (AP) -- Saying that government is unable to meet
the major challenges of the day, John McCain urged the graduating
class at Colgate University to enter public life to ''reform the
practices of politics and the institutions of government that
threaten the quality of our freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Be patriots,'' the Arizona senator told the nearly 670
graduates Sunday. ''As you leave the familiar confines of this
college and begin building careers and acquiring the qualities and
material of independent, adult lives, please remember that you are
and always have been part of something larger than your individual
interests. You are Americans, and I appeal to you to be patriots.
Our patriotism is a common responsibility. We are responsible to
each other for our freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said it was important for the Class of 2000 to consider
public service. And he said he was worried that some had been
affected by rampant public cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe it is a very healthy thing for Americans to be
skeptical about the purpose and practices of public officials and
refrain from expecting too much from government,'' McCain said to
an audience of just over 2,000, who were not deterred by
temperatures in the mid-50s and a light drizzle that fell on the
outdoor ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ''But healthy skepticism has become widespread cynicism
bordering on alienation, and that worries me greatly,'' he said.
''When the people come to believe that politics has become so
polarizing, and government has become so dysfunctional that it no
longer serves our basic constitutional ends, civil consensus will
eventually deteriorate to the point that our culture might fragment
beyond recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   And McCain shouldered some of the responsibility for what has
gone wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fault for public cynicism and alienation does not lie with
the people,'' he said. ''It lies with those of us who are
privileged to hold public office. We are to blame for the sickness
in American political life. It is we who have squandered the public
trust.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who was held captive for five years during the Vietnam
war, was chosen to deliver the address at Colgate's 179th
commencement by a committee of students, faculty members and
trustees. Colgate president Charles Karelis said he hoped McCain's
presence would help the university ''underscore its message to
students that courage and leadership are all part of taking
responsibility and charting a productive course for one's life.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the not-so-serious side of McCain shone through. He
managed to make light of the day, poking fun at his own college
career at the U.S. Naval Academy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The invitation to give this commencement address is a great
honor for someone who graduated fifth from the bottom in the United
States Naval Academy Class of 1958,'' said McCain, who received an
honorary doctor of laws degree from Colgate. ''To stand here, in
full academic regalia, and address an audience of distinguished
academics and their learned students has reaffirmed my long-held
faith in America that anything is possible.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has been making visits to several universities as part of
a tour of campuses nationwide to counter political apathy among
young people. And Republicans said he might be back in New York
state again soon, to help U.S. Rep. Rick Lazio in his Senate
campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, a relatively unknown Long Island congressman, formally
declared he was entering the Senate race to replace New York City
mayor Rudolph Giuliani. He dropped out Friday, citing his impending
battle with prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   At Hamilton College in Clinton County Sunday, retired United
Nations Undersecretary Sir Brian Urquhart spoke to graduates on
''Nationalism, Globalism and Common Sense.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to tell you that after 41 years in the United Nations
and six years in the British Army before that, common sense has
very little influence in war and surprisingly little in peace.''
Urquhart said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pride, vanity, greed, fear, ambition, prejudice and sometimes
hatred'' are more powerful motives, Urquhart said.
</P>
<P>
   ''For example, why on earth would two of the poorest countries
on earth, Ethiopia and Eritrea, both with catastrophic famines in
their own countries choose this moment to have a total war about a
few square miles of desert which no one ever heard of before?''

<HEADLINE> Lazio begins Senate campaign on talk shows and hurried upstate tour </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHEEKTOWAGA, N.Y. (AP) -- Five Rick Lazio supporters held up blue
cardboard letters Sunday while awaiting the newly announced U.S.
Senate candidate's first campaign visit upstate.
</P>
<P>
   ''See, they're spelling his name, honey,'' Mary Beth Cerrone
pointed out to her 9-year-old-son, Dominic. ''L-A-Z-I-O.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a lesson Lazio must now teach the rest of the state as the
largely unknown Republican picks up where New York City Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani left off in the GOP's pursuit of Daniel Patrick
Moynihan's Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   Wasting no time after announcing his candidacy in his high
school gym Saturday, Lazio scheduled hurried visits to Buffalo,
Rochester, Syracuse and Binghamton after making the rounds on the
Sunday morning television talk show circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ''New Yorkers will not have to worry about who Rick Lazio is and
what his ambition is,'' Lazio told supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never needed an exploratory committee to find western New
York or figure out where I want to live,'' he said in one of
several swipes at Hillary Rodham Clinton's non-New York roots,
already a favored topic in his campaign against the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   The four-term Congressman used 15- to 30-minute stops in the
upstate cities to tell a condensed version of his life story,
introduce his wife, Patricia, and two young daughters, and credit
his military parents for instilling ''bedrock values'' of family,
work and responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those are the values of New York and those are the values I'm
going to bring to the U.S. Senate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of the hopes and dreams that you have for your children
and grandchildren,'' he said, ''I have for mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, 42, said he will stand on his ''mainstream record that
fits the thinking of the vast majority of the people of our state''
and described himself as a fiscal conservative, committed
environmentalist and small-government conservative who supports a
woman's right to choose but not a procedure opponents call
''partial-birth abortions.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a family supporter, here with my family, who dreams of a
culture that helps parents trying to raise their children and
rejects the corrupting pollution of thoughtless violence on
television and the movies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On gun control, Lazio, who broke with his party to support the
Brady Bill, said he supports ''reasonable measures to support the
rights of sportsmen while aggressively protecting our children from
the illegal use of handguns.''
</P>
<P>
   He promised to be a frequent visitor upstate, addressing a
concern of voters who complained they did not see enough of
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to be here so often I'm going to be sweating Buffalo
wings,'' he told 150 Buffalo-area supporters who greeted him with
chants of ''New York Lazio'' and hastily made campaign signs.
</P>
<P>
   After Lazio made a similar promise in Rochester, Steve Minarik,
chairman of the Monroe County Republican party, said he expects
Lazio to do better upstate than Giuliani would have.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Rick Lazio has a better understanding of what it's
going to take to represent upstate New York,'' Minarik said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm more excited. I like underdogs. He's a nice guy ... I like
guys who care,'' Minarik said.
</P>
<P>
   At a third stop at Syracuse's Hancock International Airport,
Lazio was met by supporters for both him and his opponent, all
jockeying for position with their campaign signs. One person would
hold up a Hillary sign and a Lazio sign would go up in front of it.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio emphasized being a native New Yorker and his record during
his talk. He appeared with his wife and two children.
</P>
<P>
   He said he expected liberal groups from outside New York to join
Hillary Clinton against him and to that he said, ''Bring them on.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he presented voters with a clear choice compared to
Mrs. Clinton, whom he identified as a ''big-spending liberal,'' who
is presently trying to ''repackage'' herself. ''Hillary Clinton is
no more a new Democrat than a New Yorker.''
</P>
<P>
   A Hillary Clinton supporter said the group showed up to show
their support.
</P>
<P>
   Mary McCandless, from Syracuse, said, ''Just because someone is
not from New York doesn't mean they can't do the job. Think about
it, how many people living in New York were actually born here?
What are we doing, discriminating against anyone who wasn't born
here?''

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court To Review Smog Rules  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court, stepping into an enormous
environmental battle, today agreed to decide the fate of tougher
federal regulations for curtailing smog and soot nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The justices said they will review a federal appeals court
ruling that blocked the Environmental Protection Agency from
enforcing clean-air standards it adopted in 1997, among the most
contentious regulations ever issued by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   The highest court's decision is expected sometime in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute carries ''profound implications for the health of
the American public,'' government lawyers told the court.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA says the tougher standards are needed to protect people
with respiratory ailments, the elderly and children from the
adverse health effects of dirty air.
</P>
<P>
   The standards were successfully challenged by a large coalition
of industry groups and three states -- Michigan, Ohio and West
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of the Appeals for
the District of Columbia ruled by a 2-1 vote last year that the
agency overstepped its authority. The appeals court panel said the
EPA had interpreted the 1990 Clean Air Act ''so loosely'' that it
unlawfully usurped Congress' legislative power.
</P>
<P>
   The full appeals court voted 6-5 in October against reviewing
the panel's decision.
</P>
<P>
   The revised air standards limited the allowable level of ozone,
an essential part of smog, to 0.08 parts per million, instead of
the 0.12 parts per million under the old requirement. And states
for the first time were required to regulate microscopic
particulates, or soot, from power plants, cars and other sources
down to 2.5 microns, or 28 times smaller than the width of a human
hair.
</P>
<P>
   The Clean Air Act authorizes the EPA to issue air quality
standards to protect human health. The law says the agency may set
pollution limits that ''accurately reflect the latest scientific
knowledge useful in indicating the kind and extent of all
identifiable effects on public health or welfare which may be
expected from the presence of a pollutant.''
</P>
<P>
   In its decision last year, the appeals court panel said the EPA
''rightly recognizes that the question is one of degree but offers
no intelligible principle by which to identify a stopping point.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration's Supreme Court appeal cited a 1989 decision
in which the justices gave Congress considerable leeway in
delegating its power. ''A practical understanding that in our
increasingly complex society, replete with ever-changing and more
technical problems, Congress simply cannot do its job absent an
ability to delegate power under broad general directives,'' the
court said then.
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers aid the appeals court decision ignored that
''crucial practical understanding,'' and by doing so ''opened to
potential constitutional attack ... numerous other federal statutes
containing similarly broad grants of authority to administrative
agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Two states -- Massachusetts and New Jersey -- also appealed, as
did the American Lung Association. The court left those appeals
still pending, probably until a decision is reached on the EPA's
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Industry groups filed cross-appeals that said the justices, if
they review the appeals court's decision, should also review those
portions of the ruling that freed the EPA from taking costs into
account and rejected the groups' contention that the air-quality
standards were based on incomplete and poor science.
</P>
<P>
   The court also did not act on those cases.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Browner vs. American Trucking Association, 99-1257.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq at Low for Year; Dow Down 65  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index slid to its low point
for the year today as investors sold technology stocks on the fear
that their earnings will be hammered as interest rates creep
higher.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq
composite index was down 113.98 at 3,276.42, well below its lowest
close of the year --3,321.29 on April 14, when the index sustained a
devastating 355.49-point drop.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 64.77 at 10,562.08,
and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was off 12.39 at 1,394.56.
</P>
<P>
   Bellwether technology companies were continuing a long, steady
slide that has knocked the Nasdaq composite index 35 percent below
its March 10 record. Intel fell 1| to 116\ and Cisco Systems fell 2
1/16 to 51].
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said investors appear to have determined that with
interest rates on the rise, the high price of technology stocks may
not be justified by their earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Federal Reserve raised rates for the sixth time
since last June. Recent economic reports have offered a mixed
report on whether the Fed's rate increases are successfully slowing
the economy, and the next major report won't hit the market until
Thursday, when the Commerce Department issues a preliminary report
on the gross domestic product during the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors led the Dow lower, tumbling 7 15/16 to 79 1/16.
The company is allowing shareholders to swap stock for shares in
Hughes Electronics, a wholly owned subsidiary. The deal is
ultimately expected to boost GM's stock price, and will reduce the
number of GM shares on the market, driving GM's earnings per share
higher.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 6-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 98.02 million shares,
well behind Friday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index fell 9.13 to 470.57.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 2.8 percent as
leading technology stocks fell steeply. In afternoon trading,
Germany's DAX index was down 0.5 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was
up 0.5 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 0.04 percent.

<HEADLINE> Plane crashes, kills all 19 people aboard  </HEADLINE>
By TINA MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) -- Investigators will focus on why two
engines of a commuter plane carrying 19 people from a weekend trip
to Atlantic City reportedly failed at the same time, federal
transportation officials said today.
</P>
<P>
   National Transportation Safety Board member George Black said
engines failing simultaneously is ''highly improbable'' and could
indicate some sort of systems failure, including fuel
contamination.
</P>
<P>
   ''Water is always a worry, but there could be other contaminants
in the fuel,'' Black said today. ''We are trying to find where the
aircraft was last refueled and pull information. Hopefully, we can
get samples there. But yes, we are looking at fuel and fuel
systems.''
</P>
<P>
   The plane crashed at 11:48 a.m. Sunday on its second approach to
the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport. The 17 passengers
and two pilots were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots told air traffic controllers they were experiencing
engine trouble on the second approach to the airport. Black said
foggy and rainy weather may have led to the twin-engine turbo prop
missing its first approach.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no mention of any emergency or engine problem until
the second approach,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   The BA-31 Jetstream was owned by Executive Airlines of
Farmingdale, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Peragine, Executive's chief executive officer, said
today that the pilot had 8,500 hours of flight time, including
4,000 hours on the type of plane that crashed, and the first
officer was close to being upgraded to pilot.
</P>
<P>
   ''These were two expert pilots and the machine was maintained to
the highest standards. You just don't have a clue as to what could
have possibly happened,'' Peragine said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane had left the Atlantic City Airport about 10:30 a.m.
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Hartt, spokesman for the South Jersey Transportation
Authority, which operates the airport, said the aircraft received
no maintenance or fuel there after arriving Sunday morning from
Republic Airport in Farmingdale. A telephone message left at
Republic Airport was not immediately returned today.
</P>
<P>
   Burned and twisted wreckage was scattered across a swath of
forest about 9 miles south of the airport.
</P>
<P>
   The remains of the victims were pulled from thick woods and
taken over dirt roads in the mountains to an airport hangar for
identification today. The passengers were believed to be from the
area around Wilkes-Barre and Scranton, two nearby cities in
northeastern Pennsylvania, about 90 miles north of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ''These were people who were very much loved in our community,''
Scranton Mayor Jim Connors said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the tragedy had shaken this region that is surrounded by
dense forests and pristine lakes, popular for camping and hunting.
</P>
<P>
   The passengers were on a short gambling trip to Atlantic City on
a plane chartered by a casino. The plane had departed for New
Jersey at 5 p.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives and friends filed into the airport throughout the day
Sunday. Many of them dabbed their eyes as they left the building,
where they received consolation from clergy and counselors.
</P>
<P>
   Elected officials joined them in an airport building occupied by
the Red Cross. They gathered around tables, talking and offering
support to each other, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Airport Superintendent Jim Brunozzi said his niece's
mother-in-law and father-in-law were among the victims.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was tough to look at the manifest and see the names,''
Brunozzi said. ''We were a close family. It's sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony J. Giannone, airport ground superintendent, had to
console a friend whose wife was on the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's got two small kids, and he had to leave here to tell
them,'' Giannone said.
</P>
<P>
   Wy A. Gowell, the airport's assistant director, said the group
had taken a flight chartered by Caesars Atlantic City Hotel Casino.
They were to return at 1:15 a.m., but fog kept the plane grounded
in Farmingdale, N.Y., so they spent Saturday night at the hotel,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Megan Maguire was outside gardening at her home near the airport
on the northern rim of the Pocono Mountains when she heard a plane
apparently having problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard the engines die, then I heard them start up again, and
then they just died. I heard it rev up twice, so it died twice,''
Maguire said.

<HEADLINE> Court Helps Fliers With Lost Luggage  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today let stand a ruling
that could force airlines to pay a lot more to some passengers
whose luggage was lost or damaged.
</P>
<P>
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal in which American
Airlines sought to limit how much it may have to pay for five
suitcases that disappeared, or arrived empty, during a family's
1995 trip from the District of Columbia to the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's major air carriers told the justices that a federal
appeals court ruling in the American Airlines case ''will
senselessly harm the airlines and raise the cost of air travel for
their passengers.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue was a now-amended provision of the Warsaw Convention, a
treaty on international air travel, that generally limited air
carrier liability for lost or damaged luggage to $9.07 per pound.
</P>
<P>
   The English-language translation of that provision listed
various information to be contained on luggage receipts given to
passengers. That information included the weight of each package
checked with the airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty stated that a carrier's failure to provide for two
other pieces of information ''and'' the piece of luggage's weight
on the receipt disqualifies that carrier from liability limits.
</P>
<P>
   The required listing of luggage weight on passenger receipts was
dropped last year.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen members of the Cruz family from Silver Spring, Md.,
checked 28 bags with American at Washington's National Airport as
they began a trip just before Christmas 1995 to attend a relative's
wedding in the Dominican Republic. Four of the bags never arrived
at the airport in Santo Domingo, and a fifth eventually arrived
damaged and empty.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines initially refused to pay any compensation, and
the Cruz family sued for $15,000 -- the asserted value of the bags
and their contents. A federal trial judge ruled that the
$9.07-per-pound limit applied even though American had failed to
record any weight for the lost luggage on the passengers' receipts.
</P>
<P>
   American's policy is to assume that any lost piece of luggage
weighed the allowable free maximum, usually 70 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said the treaty's language meant that the liability
limit applied if any of the three pieces of information were listed
on a passenger's receipt. Listing all three pieces of information
was not required, the judge ruled.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
reversed that ruling last October, and sent the Cruz family's case
back to the judge to reconsider what compensation should be paid.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although we recognize that the district court's interpretation
is linguistically possible, we do not think it is a reasonable
construction'' of the treaty's language, the appeals court ruled.
''The convention obliges a carrier to comply with each of the three
particulars.''
</P>
<P>
   American's Supreme Court appeal was supported in a
friend-of-the-court brief submitted by the Air Transport
Association of America, which represents all major domestic
airlines and five foreign airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The association told the court that, although 99.5 percent of
all checked bags reach their intended destination without incident,
more than 450,000 pieces of baggage are delayed, lost or stolen
each year.
</P>
<P>
   Because the disputed treaty language was changed in March 1999
and owners of lost or damaged luggage have two years to make a
claim, the association said, ''There is a risk that similar suits
against other airlines, including foreign carriers, may be filed in
districts across the country until March of 2001.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is American Airlines vs. Cruz, 99-1565.

<HEADLINE> Court Throws Out Tobacco Biz Appeal  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today rejected the tobacco
industry's attempt to replace the Florida judge presiding over the
nation's only statewide lawsuit seeking damages for hundreds of
thousands of people with smoking-related injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The court, without comment, let stand rulings that threw out
cigarette makers' objection to Judge Robert Kaye's role in the
case. Their appeal said Kaye is an ex-smoker with a heart ailment --
and therefore a member of the ''class'' of an estimated 500,000
people who could share in any monetary award.
</P>
<P>
   A trial jury in Miami already has found that the tobacco
companies conspired to sell a dangerous product and should pay
$12.7 million in compensatory damages. Opening statements begin
this week in the trial's last stage, in which the jury must decide
whether to award punitive damages to punish the companies for their
conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ''The stakes are immense: the class ... seeks compensatory and
punitive damages in excess of $200 billion,'' the justices were
told. ''It is wholly inconsistent with the most fundamental notions
of fairness to have this precedent-setting, multi-billion dollar
case tried by a judge who will be eligible to receive a substantial
recovery himself if the plaintiffs prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed in 1994, and Kaye has presided over it
since 1998. After the trial began, Kaye was hospitalized for an
angioplasty to correct a blocked artery. The tobacco companies'
lawyers said they thereafter discovered, apparently from news media
stories, that Kaye was a former smoker.
</P>
<P>
   They sought to have Kaye disqualified but he and a Florida
appeals court rejected their attempt.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking help from the nation's highest court, the tobacco
companies' lawyers said, ''No principle of our judicial system is
more fundamental or has a more established pedigree than the
requirement of a neutral and disinterested decisionmaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Their appeal was supported in a friend-of-the-court brief
submitted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for those who are suing the tobacco companies said there
is ''no admissible or credible evidence established that Judge Kaye
is a member of the class.'' They said the cigarette makers ''have
taken innuendo, rumor and gossip ... to form a false premise.''
</P>
<P>
   Named as defendants in the Florida lawsuit are Philip Morris
Inc., R.J. Reynolds, Brown &AMP; Williamson, Lorillard Tobacco Co.,
Liggett and the industry's Council for Tobacco Research and Tobacco
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Philip Morris vs. Engle, 99-1277.

<HEADLINE> Court Sets Aside 'Touching' Ruling  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today set aside a ruling
that said any unwanted sexual touching is a ''crime of violence''
covered by federal law.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, who last week struck down as unconstitutional key
provisions of the federal Violence Against Women Act, told a
federal appeals court to reconsider a Utah dispute over the scope
of related provisions.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court presumably will dismiss the Utah case.
</P>
<P>
   In its May 15 decision, the nation's highest court said Congress
overstepped its authority when it gave rape victims the right to
sue their attackers in federal court. The court, by a 5-4 vote,
said states, not Congress, should provide such help for victims of
violence.
</P>
<P>
   In the Utah case, the appeals court previously ruled that women
could invoke the law when suing over unwanted sexual advances that
violate a state's criminal sexual abuse law.
</P>
<P>
   Three women sued their former boss, Bryon Rosquist, over his
alleged conduct during their employment. The 1997 federal lawsuit
filed by Melanie McCann, Noele Nelson and Lisa Nielson said
Rosquist, a chiropractor in Provo, repeatedly fondled and rubbed
their buttocks, breasts and genital areas without their consent.
Rosquist denied all the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   A federal trial judge ruled that the women could not invoke the
federal law because they had not alleged any violence. But the 10th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals revived the lawsuit last August.
</P>
<P>
   ''In enacting the VAWA (Violence Against Women Act), Congress
recognized the degree to which our nation's systems of law
enforcement and adjudication have been complicit in perpetuating
the epidemic of violence against women, in part by failing to
recognize crimes of gender-motivated violence as serious crimes,''
a three-judge panel of the appeals court said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will not compound that failing,'' it added, ''by
restricting ... the definition of violence to only those forms of
violence most traditionally feared by men -- murder and serious
bodily injury. To do otherwise would be to perpetrate ... the very
judicial indifference to gender-based violence that Congress has
endeavored to obviate.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosquist's Supreme Court appeal said many states do not include
nonconsensual sexual touching in their definitions of violent sex
offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Rosquist vs. McCann, 99-1227.

<HEADLINE> Court Narrows Whistle-Blower Law  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today narrowed a key
whistle-blower law, saying people cannot use it to file lawsuits
that accuse a state of cheating the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-2 ruling in a Vermont case upheld the basic right of
private citizens to file fraud lawsuits on the federal government's
behalf. But the justices said federal law protects the states from
being sued.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, private citizen whistle-blowers' lawsuits have
helped the government recover more than $3.5 billion from companies
that allegedly defrauded the taxpayers, according to the Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hold that a private individual has standing to bring suit
in federal court on behalf of the United States under the False
Claims Act,'' Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the court, ''but
that the False Claims Act does not subject a state (or state
agency) to liability in such actions.''
</P>
<P>
   The case stems from the 1863 federal False Claims Act, which
allows private citizens to file lawsuits on the federal
government's behalf alleging that private companies -- usually an
employer -- committed fraud against the government.
</P>
<P>
   People whose lawsuits are successful can collect a share of any
damages awarded. The Justice Department says the government has
turned over $550 million of the $3.5 billion recovered to the
private whistle-blowers. Most of the damages go to the U.S.
Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous such lawsuits have been filed over the years alleging
fraud by defense contractors, for example, or contractors for
health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration asked the justices to decide private
citizens can file such lawsuits, arguing that the government
legally can assign its claims to other people to pursue.
</P>
<P>
   Today's case reverses a federal appeals court decision that had
let a Vermont man use the law to pursue a whistle-blower case
against a state agency that had employed him. Jonathan Stevens,
formerly a lawyer for the state Agency of Natural Resources' water
supply division, alleged that the agency had submitted false time
records in connection with federal grant programs.
</P>
<P>
   Vermont officials argued that the state should not be considered
a ''person'' who could be sued under the false-claims law. They
also invoked the Constitution's 11th Amendment, which the court has
interpreted to generally bar states from being sued by individuals
in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   A trial judge let the case go forward, and the 2nd U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-four states supported Vermont's appeal to the Supreme
Court, arguing in a friend-of-the-court brief that states could be
subject to huge penalties if such whistle-blower lawsuits could be
filed against them.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court agreed last June to hear the state's appeal.
But in a surprising order issued just 10 days before the Nov. 30
argument, the justices decided to broaden the case and consider
whether private citizens can sue anyone on the federal government's
behalf, whether or not a state.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Scalia wrote that there was a ''long tradition'' of such
lawsuits in England and the American colonies.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the False Claims Act does not include states as
''persons'' who can be sued under the law. The court did not decide
whether the Constitution's 11th Amendment also protects states from
being sued under the law, but Scalia said there was ''a serious
doubt on that score.''
</P>
<P>
   His opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy, Clarence Thomas
and Stephen Breyer. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg filed a separate
opinion, saying she understood the decision to leave open the
question whether the federal government can sue states under the
False Claims Act.
</P>
<P>
   Justices John Paul Stevens and David H. Souter dissented from
the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the two, Stevens said the law ''makes it perfectly
clear'' that Congress intended to allow lawsuits against states.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Vermont Agency of Natural Resources vs. U.S.,
98-1828.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Down 207 at Low For Year  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index fell more than 200
points in early trading Monday to its low point for the year as
investors sold technology stocks on fears that earnings will be
hurt by rising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading, the Nasdaq was down 207.17 at
3,183.23, well below its lowest close of the year --3,321.29 on
April 14, when the index sustained a devastating 355.49-point drop.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average also was down sharply in early
trading, falling 173.40 to 10,453.45.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said investors appear to have determined that with
interest rates on the rise, the high price of technology stocks may
not be justified by their earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Federal Reserve raised rates for the sixth time
since last June. Recent economic reports have offered a mixed
picture about whether the Fed's rate increases are successfully
slowing the economy. The next major report isn't released until
Thursday, when the Commerce Department issues a preliminary report
on the gross domestic product during the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   With no positive economic news, many investors were either
selling or staying out of the market. Volume was relatively light.

<HEADLINE> On-the-Job Slurs Not Free Speech  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rejecting a free-speech appeal from the
nation's second-largest car rental company, the Supreme Court today
refused to let an Avis employee use ethnic epithets at his San
Francisco International Airport job.
</P>
<P>
   The justices left intact a ruling in which the California
Supreme Court said an Avis Rent a Car service station manager who
harassed co-workers with bigoted words could be ordered to stop
using such language at work in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Today's action, taken over Justice Clarence Thomas' dissent, set
no national precedent. But it left standing a decision Avis lawyers
said gives California judges ''astounding'' new power to impose
prior restraints on speech.
</P>
<P>
   The challenged ruling ''obliterates fundamental free-speech
guarantees, concluding that racially offensive speech is
constitutionally unprotected and can be banned in advance in the
workplace,'' the Avis lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   The Avis appeal did not challenge a jury's finding that both
Avis and station manager John Lawrence illegally discriminated
against Hispanics employed as drivers to move rental cars between
parking lots and check-in and service areas.
</P>
<P>
   The company and Lawrence had been sued by 17 Hispanic employees
in 1993. The lawsuit said Lawrence's treatment of them -- constantly
calling them vulgar and derogatory names based on their ethnicity
and lack of English skills -- violated the state Fair Employment and
Housing Act.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit accused Avis of doing nothing to stop Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   Avis was ordered to pay a $135,000 award to eight Hispanic
employees.
</P>
<P>
   The company challenged Judge Carlos Bea's injunction prohibiting
Lawrence from using epithets against all Hispanic employees and
ordering Avis to stop him if possible. Violations of the injunction
are considered contempt of court.
</P>
<P>
   The state Supreme Court, by a 4-3 vote last August, said the
judge's order ''does not violate ... freedom of speech if there has
been a judicial determination that the use of such epithets will
contribute to the continuation of a hostile or abusive work
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The spoken word, if discriminatory, can lose its constitutional
protection ''like violence or other types of potentially expressive
activities that produce special harms distinct from their
communicative impact,'' the state court said.
</P>
<P>
   The Avis appeal said the finding of past harassment ''is
constitutionally irrelevant'' and cannot be used to justify the
restraint on future speech. Avis ''does not condone racial
discrimination in the workplace. However, the issue here is speech,
not discrimination, since the injunction extends to the use of
words that (do) not violate the law,'' the appeal said.
</P>
<P>
   In a dissenting opinion, Thomas said, ''Even if some types of
harassing speech in the workplace do not enjoy First Amendment
protection, there has been no showing that a prior restraint,
rather than the less severe remedy of money damages for any future
violations, is necessary to regulate Lawrence's speech.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is Avis vs. Aguilar, 99-781.

<HEADLINE> Charter plane returning from gambling trip crashes, killing 19  </HEADLINE>
By TINA MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) -- Investigators will focus on why both
engines of a chartered plane carrying 19 people from a weekend trip
to Atlantic City apparently failed at the same time, federal
transportation officials said today.
</P>
<P>
   National Transportation Safety Board member George Black said
engines failing simultaneously is ''highly improbable'' and could
indicate some sort of systems failure.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll be looking at fuel systems; we'll be looking at ignition
systems, the weather -- all of the variables that are associated
with the operation of the engines,'' Black told CBS' ''The Early
Show'' this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Among the possibilities, he said, was that the fuel was somehow
contaminated. Investigators were trying to figure out where the
plane had last refueled, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Hartt, spokesman for the South Jersey Transportation
Authority, which operates the Atlantic City airport, said the
aircraft received no maintenance or fuel there after arriving
Sunday morning from Republic Airport in Farmingdale, N.Y. A
telephone message left at Republic Airport was not immediately
returned today.
</P>
<P>
   The Jetstream 31, owned by Executive Airlines of Farmingdale,
crashed Sunday in a dense and remote northeastern Pennsylvania
forest, killing all those aboard.
</P>
<P>
   National Transportation Safety Board investigators were
reviewing the transcript from air traffic controllers who spoke
with the crew before the accident. The two pilots can be heard on a
part of the tape saying, ''we lost both engines.''
</P>
<P>
   Black also said that investigators now know that pilots did not
indicate there were engine troubles on their first approach to the
Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport. The plane crashed
while attempting a second approach.
</P>
<P>
   ''We said earlier -- last night -- that we thought there was an
engine loss on the first attempt at an approach,'' he said. ''We
listened to the full tower tape last night, and there was no
mention of any emergency or engine problem until the second
approach.''
</P>
<P>
   A trail of emergency vehicles and four-wheel drive trucks had to
climb winding roads through the mist-shrouded Pocono Mountains to
reach the site where the twin-engine plane went down Sunday on its
approach to Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The victims' bodies were taken to a refrigerator truck that
acted as a makeshift morgue until authorities can use dental
records and information from families to begin identifying the
remains.
</P>
<P>
   The plane disappeared off radar during a second instrument
approach about 11:40 a.m. Sunday, said Federal Aviation
Administration spokeswoman Tammy Jones. Officials said the plane
might have missed its first approach because of the weather.
</P>
<P>
   ''The weather was bad, it was windy and there was some
precipitation. The visibility was poor,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Peragine, chief executive officer of Executive Airlines,
said today that the pilot had 8,500 hours of flight time, including
4,000 hours on the type of plane that crashed, and the first
officer was close to being upgraded to pilot.
</P>
<P>
   ''These were two expert pilots and the machine was maintained to
the highest standards. You just don't have a clue as to what could
have possibly happened,'' Peragine said.
</P>
<P>
   Burned and twisted wreckage from the plane -- carrying 17
passengers and two crew members -- was scattered across a swath of
forest about nine miles south of the airport. The plane's cockpit
voice recorder was recovered, the NTSB said.
</P>
<P>
   The group had been on an overnight gambling trip to Atlantic
City, N.J., and the plane had been chartered by Caesars Atlantic
City Hotel Casino. It's not unusual for casinos to charter flights
for their best customers.
</P>
<P>
   The group was to return at 1:15 a.m. Sunday, but fog kept the
plane grounded in Farmingdale, so they spent Saturday night at a
hotel, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The victims were believed to be from the area around
Wilkes-Barre and Scranton, a region surrounded by dense forests and
pristine lakes, popular for camping and hunting. It's about 90
miles north of Philadelphia and 150 miles northwest of Atlantic
City.
</P>
<P>
   Megan Maguire was outside gardening at her home near the airport
when she heard a plane apparently having problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard the engines die, then I heard them start up again, and
then they just died. I heard it rev up twice, so it died twice,''
Maguire said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day Sunday, teary-eyed relatives and friends
filed into the airport, where they received consolation from clergy
and counselors.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a small, close community, and that's what I think makes
it so hard,'' said Lackawanna County Commissioner Randy Castellani,
who arrived soon after the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Airport Superintendent Jim Brunozzi said his niece's
mother-in-law and father-in-law were among the victims.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was tough to look at the manifest and see the names,''
Brunozzi said. ''We were a close family. It's sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony J. Giannone, airport ground superintendent, had to
console a friend whose wife was on the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's got two small kids, and he had to leave here to tell
them,'' Giannone said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, there were three crashes of similar model
airplanes. The last came in December 1994 at the Raleigh-Durham
International Airport in North Carolina, killing 15 of 20 people
aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's crash appeared to be the worst in Pennsylvania since
1994, when a USAir 737 crashed near Pittsburgh, killing all 132
people aboard.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Lobbied on China Issue  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the days before a key China trade vote, the
AFL-CIO assembled a ''cell phone drill team'' in front of Rep.
Edward Markey's Massachusetts office. Intel Corp. used a more
conventional lobbying technique, flooding Capitol Hill with 5,000
letters from employees.
</P>
<P>
   Special interests are spending millions to sway undecided
lawmakers before this week's House vote on permanent trade
relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   ''It depends on how creative we can get,'' said Peggy Taylor, a
lobbyist for the AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   The labor federation's member unions also pitched a tent in
front of Democratic Rep. Bud Cramer's Alabama office and delivered
checks emblazoned ''no blank check for China'' to the office of
Rep. Karen Thurman, D-Fla. She wound up endorsing the bill, while
Markey said he would vote no.
</P>
<P>
   The millions in special interest money -- $10 million by the
Business Roundtable alone -- have gone for airfare, postage,
lobbyists' salaries, and even a U.S. Chamber of Commerce-published
glossy brochure with small-business owners touting the benefits of
China trade.
</P>
<P>
   Business owners, union members, farmers, religious leaders and
countless other advocates -- even a busload of Tibetan activists --
have visited lawmakers in Washington and their home districts. The
chamber has 20 full-time lobbyists just working on China this
month.
</P>
<P>
   So many people have gone through Rep. James Walsh's office, for
example, that the New York Republican has decided not to meet with
any more advocates, an aide said. For Walsh, the lobbying is as
intense as any issue he has faced since first being elected in
1988.
</P>
<P>
   Other lawmakers are getting a steady stream of visits, phone
calls and letters.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been intense and passionate on both sides,'' acknowledged
freshman Rep. Anthony Weiner, D-N.Y., who was visited by 40 Tibetan
activists opposing China trade but has since decided to endorse the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders argue that trade with China will help bring
American political ideals, such as freedom, to that country. Others
insist that granting permanent normal trade relations to China --
rather than going through a yearly renewal -- will make it easier
for the country to crack down on dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   ''Next year, they can arrest more bishops, torture evangelical
pastors, rearrest all the dissidents and we can't do anything about
it,'' said Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va.
</P>
<P>
   A series of AFL-CIO ads that aired last month echoed those
concerns about human rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you give China permanent trade status, and don't talk about
it once a year ... they'll feel that they can do whatever they
want, however they want,'' Chinese human rights activist Wei
Jingsheng said in one ad.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental and veterans' groups also oppose the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The business community, meanwhile, is taking to heart the late
House Speaker Tip O'Neill's dictum that all politics is local.
Trade groups are not sending their Washington lobbyists to
lawmakers' offices alone but instead are bringing along
representatives of local corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ''When a nation is your customer, you're less likely to treat
them as an enemy,'' said R. Scott Miller, director of national
government relations for Procter &AMP; Gamble, told Rep. John Cooksey,
R-La. P&AMP;G employs 250 people in Alexandria, La., manufacturing Tide
detergent.
</P>
<P>
   Blaine Boswell, vice president of public affairs for
Pittsburgh-based PPG Industries, which employs 4,400 people in
Pennsylvania, told an aide to undecided Rep. Chaka Fattah, D-Pa.,
how the company's Chinese plants were helped to build a middle
class overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know that Chinese middle class really has a much broader
view of the world and are looking to their political leadership for
steady progress toward a more democratic society,'' said Boswell,
part of a group brought to Washington by the National Association
of Manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   These face-to-face meetings are supplemented with visits back
home, letters, phone calls, e-mails, op-eds in local papers and
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   The agriculture industry and high-tech companies also are
playing large roles in the lobbying effort. In one 48-hour period,
Intel employees sent 5,000 computer-generated letters to lawmakers,
urging them to support China trade.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the biggest opportunity we have in the future of going
from 0 to 60,'' said Michael Maibach, the company's vice president
for government affairs, noting that China is the third-largest
market for computer chips, personal computers, and cellular
telephones.

<HEADLINE> Silver critic says he will air grievances today  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- New York's three top statewide elected
Democrats said today the power struggle between the state
Assembly's former majority leader Michael Bragman and Speaker
Sheldon Silver had ended.
</P>
<P>
   ''The battle for leadership of the Assembly is over,'' U.S. Sen.
Charles Schumer, state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer and state
Comptroller H. Carl McCall declared in a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now they have resolved it, the Democratic Party can build on
the success and unity of the state convention in Albany,'' the
three top Democrats said.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman had filed notice last week to formally challenge Silver
for the speakership in the Democrat-dominated Assembly. But a
number of defections have reduced what he once counted as 53
Democrats ''rock-solid'' behind him becoming speaker to
''several,'' and Bragman said he does not know if his resolution
challenging Silver will even get to a floor vote today.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the suburban Syracuse lawmaker vowed to continue his
overthrow-Silver fight as an anti-Silver campaign. Bragman and his
supporters have formed the Assembly Majority Reform Caucus to
address the issue, and they scheduled an afternoon news conference
to discuss the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the very least, I intend to make a very comprehensive
statement tomorrow, spelling out why this happened, what has
happened and where I intend to go at this point,'' Bragman said
Sunday evening. ''If anybody thinks I intend to go away, that's
something they should not think about.''
</P>
<P>
   Bragman said there is a wellspring of discontent among the 98
Assembly Democrats -- only temporarily staunched by strong-arm
lobbying tactics by Silver, he argued -- who believe the speaker is
secretive and autocratic.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman blamed his eroding support on Silver allegedly
threatening to run other Democrats in primaries this year against
incumbents not supporting the speaker, or to draw new district
lines for the 2002 elections so that they could not hope to hold
their seats.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the pressure Silver placed on opponents, Bragman
said Sunday it is something of a miracle the ex-majority leader has
anyone still willing to stand by him.
</P>
<P>
   ''The members who withstood this harassment and bludgeoning are
the most courageous members I have come across,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the crisis over, Silver held a buffet and strategy
session Sunday night at the Capitol for the 50 ''core'' members he
believed were behind him all the way in the power struggle against
Bragman. Other Democratic assemblymen, their allegiances more
suspect, were to meet with the speaker today.
</P>
<P>
   A last straw, of sorts, to Bragman's hopes came Sunday when
Queens Democratic leader Thomas Manton and Silver had breakfast
together in Manhattan to try to clear the air over their
long-standing feud. They issued a joint statement afterward
promising a ''new partnership.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This new era of goodwill begins with support for Sheldon
Silver as speaker of the New York state Assembly,'' the two
politicians said.
</P>
<P>
   Almost exactly four days earlier, Manton had stood at an Albany
news conference promoting Bragman as Silver's replacement. ''I
believe he's lost the confidence of his members,'' Manton said of
Silver at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The rapprochement reached Sunday effectively meant Bragman could
not count on any of the 15 Democratic Assembly members from Queens
to back him against Silver. But Bragman said he held no ill will
toward Manton.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tom Manton has been a gentleman throughout this process, a
partner I hold in the highest regard,'' Bragman said.
</P>
<P>
   Another blow to Bragman's hopes of toppling Silver was dealt by
Bronx Democratic leader Roberto Ramirez, who is also an
assemblyman, when he sided with Silver last Thursday. Bragman had
been trying to woo him to his camp.
</P>
<P>
   And, Bragman appeared to be counting on far more help from
McCall -- he called him his ''partner'' last Wednesday when
announcing the coup attempt -- than he got. Bragman has been an
early and vocal supporter of McCall's likely run for governor in
2002 against Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman said McCall called him on Saturday to say it was not in
the comptroller's best interests to take sides in the emotional and
divisive Assembly leadership fight. That had roughly the same
effect as a statement issued by the leadership of many of the
state's most powerful unions on Thursday saying this was not a good
time for a power struggle atop the Democratic Assembly. Both
pronouncements effectively supported retaining the status quo,
meaning Sheldon Silver.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman told the Syracuse Post-Standard Saturday he never had an
agreement that McCall would back Bragman against Silver, ''but he
was going to bring in key support.'' Bragman added, ''He, and he
alone, could have turned it around.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCall and his aides insisted throughout that the
comptroller, the only black ever elected to statewide office in New
York and an influential voice among minority legislators,
considered the Bragman-Silver struggle an internal Assembly matter.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman said he still supports McCall for governor in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman, from suburban Syracuse, was stripped of his majority
leader's title, his $34,500-a-year stipend and the vast resources
that go with the majority leader's office.
</P>
<P>
   But he insisted Sunday night he knew the potential hazards of
his actions and was comfortable with his new lot in the
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the first time in many years I feel absolutely free, free
to say anything that is necessary to bring reform to this house,''
Bragman said.

<HEADLINE> Court To Clarify Army Corps Role  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to clarify
whether the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers can regulate the use of
land containing waters that are home to migrating birds.
</P>
<P>
   The court said it will hear arguments by a group of Illinois
municipalities that say the corps lacks authority to keep them from
building a landfill on a site in Cook County.
</P>
<P>
   The Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County, a consortium of
23 municipalities, decided during the 1980s to build a solid-waste
landfill on a 533-acre site straddling Cook and Kane counties.
</P>
<P>
   The site had been a strip mine about 50 years earlier, and areas
that once were gravel pits had become about 200 ponds used as
seasonal nesting and breeding areas by a variety of migratory
birds.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Clean Water Act requires a permit from the Corps of
Engineers to dispose landfill in ''waters of the United States,''
including lakes, wetlands and ponds.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, the agency asked the Corps of Engineers whether it
needed a permit to build on the site. The corps said a permit was
needed because of a 1986 rule specifying that water used as
migratory bird habitat is considered ''waters of the United
States'' under the clean air law.
</P>
<P>
   The government denied a permit for the landfill, and the solid
waste agency sued. A federal judge ruled for the government, and
the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed last October.
</P>
<P>
   Regulation of migratory bird habitat falls under Congress'
authority to regulate interstate commerce because millions of
people travel each year to observe and hunt migratory birds, the
appeals court said.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal acted on today, the agency's lawyers said the 7th
Circuit court ruling lets the Corps of Engineers act as a ''sort of
super zoning agency'' to take over land-use decisions traditionally
made by local governments.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyers said migratory birds are protected by
international treaties and that loss of wetlands is a national
problem.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County vs. U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers, 99-1178.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Optimistic on China Vote  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton expressed optimism today
about winning a House vote to grant China permanent trade benefits
in perhaps the hardest fought congressional battle of the year.
</P>
<P>
   'I'm hopeful,'' the president said. ''We're making progress.''
</P>
<P>
   He made the remark to reporters in the East Room at the
conclusion of a ceremony welcoming South African President Thabo
Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
   The House vote is expected at midweek. Senate passage is nearly
assured.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really been tough to get the votes in on this. But we're
doing real well,'' said House Republican Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas.
''We're moving towards that magic number of 218 votes'' to pass the
trade bill, DeLay said on ''Fox News Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and other supporters of
the trade deal were more circumspect.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we're working very hard, and I don't want to say that
we do'' have the votes to pass it, Albright said on ABC's ''This
Week.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill, the last major trade fight of Clinton's tenure, has
made for strange bedfellows. Most Republicans support the deal,
while many in the president's own party oppose it along with labor,
environmental and human rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, usually one of Clinton's most reliable critics, predicted
eventual victory and credited Clinton personally.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president's been working very hard,'' DeLay said. ''The
Democrats are not coming along like we thought they would.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal would open Chinese markets to more U.S. goods and end
the annual congressional review of China's trading status. It also
speeds the way for China to enter the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and other free-trade advocates say the deal will be good
for American business and can help lead China toward political and
human rights improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a big deal to me, beyond the obvious economic benefits
which make it easier for some members than others to vote for,
because of the economic makeup of their districts,'' Clinton said
Sunday during a strategy session for Democrats at the Hyde Park,
N.Y., home of Franklin D. Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bills are H.R. 4444 and S. 2277.

<HEADLINE> N.Y. Must Share Desegregation Costs  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court, rejecting an appeal by New
York officials, today refused to spare the state from having to pay
half the $85 million-per-year costs of racially integrating public
schools in Yonkers.
</P>
<P>
   The court, without comment, let stand rulings requiring the
state to share costs of a desegregation plan that includes magnet
schools, voluntary busing, school closings and staff reassignments
for the city's 24,000-student school district.
</P>
<P>
   The state's appeal had argued that the city, just north of New
York City, and its school district pay for the desegregation
efforts on their own.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal said a federal appeals court ruling in the Yonkers
case may lead other courts to ''impose novel and expansive
liability on the states for the unconstitutional acts of their
municipal subdivisions and local school districts.''
</P>
<P>
   It added: ''The issues presented ... are of vast importance to
the state of New York and to states throughout the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The long legal dispute over racial desegregation of Yonkers
schools dates back to 1980, when the federal government sued the
city and local school board, alleging civil rights violations in
education and housing.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge ruled in 1985 that Yonkers officials
intentionally and unlawfully promoted racial segregation through
their housing and school policies. He ordered the city to
desegregate the school system and build subsidized housing in
predominantly white sections of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The case attracted national attention when in 1988 four defiant
city councilmen were threatened with jail as well as fines, and the
city faced possible bankruptcy, for refusing the judge's orders.
</P>
<P>
   The ensuing contempt-of-court fines against the councilmen were
overturned by a 5-4 Supreme Court decision in 1990. But the city
treasury had to pay heavy fines.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, the Yonkers school board sought to have the state held
partially liable, contending that inaction by the state government
held back integration efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Protracted litigation over the state's involvement ended in
court rulings that the state could be forced to help pay for
remedies because it ''failed to take corrective measures.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest decision requiring state participation in paying for
desegregation came last November when a three-judge panel of the
2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld ''apportioning costs ...
equally between the state and Yonkers.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is New York vs. Yonkers Board of Education, 99-1370.

<HEADLINE> Court Narrows Federal Anti-Arson Law  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A unanimous Supreme Court today narrowed the
scope of a federal anti-arson law, throwing out an Indiana man's
federal conviction for setting a fire at his cousin's home.
</P>
<P>
   The federal law makes it a crime to set afire any building or
other property ''used in interstate commerce or foreign commerce or
in any activity affecting interstate or foreign commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court upheld use of that law to prosecute
arson at a private residence because the owner purchased natural
gas in interstate commerce, had a mortgage from an out-of-state
lender and received an after-fire check from an out-of-state
insurer.
</P>
<P>
   That's not enough to subject someone to federal, rather than
state, prosecution, the nation's highest court said today.
</P>
<P>
   ''An owner-occupied residence not used for any commercial
purpose does not qualify as property 'used in commerce or
commerce-affecting activity; arson of such a dwelling, therefore,
is not subject to federal prosecution,'' Justice Ruth Bader
Ginsburg wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
   The decision set aside the arson conviction and 30-year prison
sentence of Dewey J. Jones, accused of throwing a lit Molotov
cocktail into the living room of James Walker's home in Fort Wayne,
Ind. -- the culmination of a feud he was having with his cousin.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents joined local law enforcement officials in
investigating the Feb. 23, 1998, incident, and Jones eventually was
indicted by a federal grand jury under the arson law.
</P>
<P>
   His conviction and sentence were upheld by the 7th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals. Other federal appeals courts had refused to apply
the federal law to such cases.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' appeal to the Supreme Court had urged the justices to
rule that Congress exceeded its authority and trampled on states'
rights by enacting the arson law. The court since 1995 has
dramatically enhanced state' rights while eroding congressional
power to invoke authority over interstate commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Today's decision focused entirely on the language of the federal
law. Ginsburg said the trial judge in Jones' case and the 7th
Circuit court mistakenly interpreted that language too broadly.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Jones vs. U.S., 99-5739.

<HEADLINE> Prior Conviction Testimony Stands  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Criminal defendants who beat federal
prosecutors to the punch by telling jurors about their previous
convictions cannot later appeal the judge's decision to let the
jury hear about the prior crimes, a deeply divided Supreme Court
ruled today.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors often seek permission to cross-examine defendants
about prior crimes to discredit their trial testimony. When a judge
issues a pretrial order allowing such tactics, defendants usually
opt to tell the jury themselves so they do not seem to be hiding
something.
</P>
<P>
   The court, by a 5-4 vote, said federal defendants who choose to
acknowledge those crimes always waive the right to appeal the
judge's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Federal appeals courts had split on that issue.
</P>
<P>
   Today's ruling leaves some defendants with a tough choice: Give
up the right to testify in their own behalf so the jury does not
learn about earlier convictions or let prosecutors tell the jury
and appeal the use of that evidence if they are convicted.
</P>
<P>
   ''In our view, there is nothing unfair ... about putting (a
defendant) to her choice in accordance with the normal rules of
trial,'' Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
   ''A defendant who pre-emptively introduces evidence may not on
appeal claim that the admission of such evidence was error,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Trial judges have the authority to decide whether defendants'
prior convictions will be allowed as trial evidence to cast doubt
on the credibility of their testimony. Such evidence is admitted
only if a judge determines its relevance exceeds the unfair
prejudice among jurors that may result.
</P>
<P>
   Today's decision in a California case upheld a woman's drug
conviction and 30-month prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Suzuki Ohler was stopped by U.S. Customs agents when she
tried to enter the country from Mexico at San Ysidro, Calif., in
July 1997. An agent noticed an interior panel of her van had been
tampered with, and found more than 80 pounds of marijuana inside.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors sought and obtained a judge's permission to attack
Ohler's credibility, if she testified, by introducing evidence of
her 1993 felony conviction for possession of methamphetamine.
</P>
<P>
   When Ohler took the stand, she told the jury about the 1993
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   She then appealed her conviction, contending that the judge
should not have allowed the prior-conviction evidence. The 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Ohler had waived her right to
pursue such an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Rehnquist's opinion were Justices Sandra Day O'Connor,
Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Joined in dissent were the court's four more liberal justices --
David H. Souter, John Paul Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen
G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the four, Souter said the decision ''is without
support in precedent, the rules of evidence or the reasonable
objectives of trial.''
</P>
<P>
   The court in 1984 ruled that federal defendants who choose not
to testify rather than have prosecutors introduce prior convictions
to attack their credibility cannot appeal the trial judge's
decision to let in such evidence.
</P>
<P>
   That decision said only defendants who actually testify and have
their credibility challenged by the prior-conviction evidence can
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Ohler's lawyer said she chose to testify, and mentioned the
prior convictions herself to ''remove the sting of imminent
cross-examination.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is Ohler vs. U.S., 98-9828.

<HEADLINE> Thurmond Released From Hospital  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Strom Thurmond, the oldest and
longest-serving senator in American history, was released from the
hospital once again Monday after a three-day stay for what an aide
said was a back problem.
</P>
<P>
   The South Carolina Republican, 97, was released from Walter Reed
Army Medical Center at 10 a.m., said spokeswoman Genevieve Erny. An
hour later, he was back at his customary task of gaveling the
Senate to order for the day's session.
</P>
<P>
   Thurmond's most recent hospitalization, which began Friday
morning, was his third in recent days. On May 15 he had been
released from Walter Reed after twice being hospitalized for an
upset stomach and fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   Erny said doctors ''never made a definitive diagnosis'' about
Thurmond's back problem. The senator has been hospitalized
repeatedly in recent years for various problems, and had prostate
surgery last year.
</P>
<P>
   Thurmond was first elected to the Senate in 1954.

<HEADLINE> Court Studies Laws' Retroactivity  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to use a
Tennessee murder case to clarify when judicial rulings that stiffen
criminal laws can be applied to acts that occurred earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The justices said they will hear a Tennessee man's argument that
he was wrongly convicted of murder because the victim lived more
than a year after the assault occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Wilbert K. Rogers contends Tennessee's traditional ''year and a
day'' law barred people from being convicted of murder in such
cases. But a Tennessee court canceled the law and said that
cancellation could be applied retroactively to his case because it
was a foreseeable change in law.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say Rogers stabbed James Bowdery in the chest on May
7, 1994. Shortly afterward, Bowdery suffered a heart attack and
brain damage. He survived in a vegetative state until August 1995,
when he died of a kidney infection related to the coma.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers was convicted in Shelby County of second-degree murder
and sentenced to 33 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers' appeal to the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals relied
on the ''year and a day'' rule, which he said had been declared
binding law by state courts. However, the appeals court said the
rule was canceled when the state codified its criminal laws in 1989
without including it.
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee Supreme Court said the 1989 state criminal code
did not abolish the rule, and that it was in force when the Bowdery
assault occurred.
</P>
<P>
   However, the state's top court also said the rule was no longer
justified, and it canceled the rule. Further, the court said that
cancellation could be applied retroactively to Rogers' case because
it was not unexpected. Therefore, the court upheld his conviction.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal acted on today, Rogers' lawyer said applying the
ruling retroactively to his case violated his due-process rights
under the Constitution's Fifth and 14th Amendments.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee prosecutors said the state court ruling ''was not an
unforeseeable judicial enlargement of a criminal statute'' and
therefore it could be applied to Rogers' case.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the Supreme Court threw out a Texas man's
sex-assault convictions that were based on a law enacted after he
allegedly committed the crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Today's case is Rogers vs. Tennessee, 99-6218.

<HEADLINE> Lazio picks up backing of Conservative leader; Clinton gets Liberal boss </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- In a crucial development for his fledgling
Senate campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton, Rep. Rick Lazio
picked up the backing today of state Conservative Party Chairman
Michael Long.
</P>
<P>
   No Republican running for statewide office has won since 1974
without Conservative Party support in New York. The backing can
make the difference in a close race.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think his chances are really excellent,'' Long said this
morning in announcing his support for the congressman from Long
Island.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the boss of the state's Liberal Party came out ''100
perecent'' behind the first lady's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no doubt she will emerge as the candidate of the
Liberal Party,'' Liberal Party leader Raymond Harding said late
this morning.
</P>
<P>
   No Democrat has been elected governor or U.S. senator in New
York without Liberal Party backing since the party was founded in
1944.
</P>
<P>
   Harding has been a top political adviser to Rudolph Giuliani,
the Republican New York City mayor who dropped out of the Senate
race on Friday to deal with his prostate cancer. That opened the
door for Lazio to jump into the Senate race on the GOP side and
cleared the way for Harding to get behind Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The backing of Long for Lazio and Harding for Clinton is
expected to set the stage for their nominations, respectively, by
the third parties on June 3 when they hold their state nominating
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Long's backing of Lazio came after former U.S. Rep. Joseph
DioGuardi told the party chairman that he would not continue with
his quest for the Conservative Party's Senate nomination. DioGuardi
had entered the fray because of his policy disagreements with
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Long had refused to get behind Giuliani's Senate bid because of
the New York City mayor's refusal to come out in favor of a ban on
a late-term abortion procedure that critics call ''partial-birth
abortion'' and the mayor's strong ties to the state's Liberal
Party.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, while maintaining he is an abortion rights supporter,
favors banning the abortion procedure and has never run with
Liberal Party backing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Republican George Pataki beat three-term Democratic
incumbent Mario Cuomo in the governor's race on the strength of the
vote on the Conservative Party line. Unlike other states, New York
allows major party candidates to also count votes from third-party
ballot lines.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing he has a lot of ground to cover to get his nascent
Senate campaign up and running, Lazio hit the ground running Sunday
in a whirlwind tour, determined to overcome the biggest immediate
obstacle in his quest to beat Clinton: his own obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio flew to Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse and Binghamton
Sunday, stopping for about 30 minutes in each town to rally support
for his Senate run. He planned to visit Elmira, Watertown, Utica,
Albany and Westchester County today.
</P>
<P>
   Early on Sunday, Lazio appeared on six television talk shows and
gave the commencement address at a Long Island college.
</P>
<P>
   ''My challenge is to make sure that people know the real Rick
Lazio before the other side gets out and tries to fool the New York
people about who I am,'' Lazio said on CNN's ''Late Edition.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said he wasn't troubled by a new Zogby poll that showed
Clinton ahead, 46 percent to 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''I expect to be behind for a long time,'' Lazio told reporters
as he left the New York Institute of Technology in Old Westbury, on
Long Island. ''I expect to be the underdog throughout this race.''
</P>
<P>
   While upstate, Lazio told a condensed version of his life story,
introduced his wife and two daughters and credited his military
parents for instilling ''bedrock values'' of family, work and
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   He also promised to be a frequent visitor upstate, addressing a
concern of voters who complained they did not see enough of
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who spent Sunday in Albany and Troy, scolded Lazio for
using his campaign announcement a day earlier to attack her as a
liberal carpetbagger with political ambitions beyond the U.S.
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was a little disappointed yesterday that my latest opponent
has already started hurling insults instead of offering ideas about
what we can do to improve the lives of New Yorkers,'' Clinton said.
''Every candidate has to make a decision about what kind of
campaign he or she will run. Will it be a campaign of ideas and
issues or a campaign of insults? ... I am sorry that my opponent
could not even get through his announcement speech without going on
the attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's campaign adviser Harold Ickes, campaign manager Bill
deBlasio and spokesman Howard Wolfson on Sunday's talk shows
portrayed Lazio as a lieutenant of Newt Gingrich and said his
support of the Contract with America was out of step with the
mainstream of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio defended his position rather than trying to distance
himself from it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know which one of the things on the Contract with
America that they are against,'' Lazio told ''Late Edition.'' ''Is
it the balanced budget? Is it lowering taxes? Is it a strong
national defense? If that's what they're against and I'm for, I'm
comfortable fighting on those grounds.''
</P>
<P>
   In the series of television interviews, Lazio sought to define
himself as ''just a plain old New Yorker'' -- native of Long Island,
son of an auto-parts dealer, married with two small children who
attend public school.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by ''Fox News Sunday'' if there were any skeletons in his
closet, like drug or health problems, he said: ''I'm clean as a
whistle.''

<HEADLINE> 'Million Dollar Man' turns against wrestling  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ELMIRA, N.Y. (AP) -- As a professional wrestler, Ted DiBiase was
the 'Million Dollar Man' who would enter the ring wearing a tuxedo
and diamond-encrusted belt.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the 46-year-old DiBiase won't let his kids watch the sport
that made him rich. His motto when he was wrestling was ''Every man
has his price.'' His new motto is, ''You've got to walk the walk
(when it comes to faith).''
</P>
<P>
   ''Do you think Jesus would sit down in your living room and
watch 'Smackdown'?'' he asked a crowd at the YMCA here Saturday
night, referring to the raucous but very popular WWF TV show.''
</P>
<P>
   DiBiase said he still does some pro wrestling commentary.
</P>
<P>
   But, he conceded, his wrestling spirit died hard.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't take the wrestler out of the man,'' he said. ''(Now)
I'm an in-your-face Christian.''
</P>
<P>
   For five years, DiBiase was ''The Million Dollar Man,'' a WWF
villain, who, when he could not win, attempted to buy success. Now,
he said, his wrestling days are definitely over.
</P>
<P>
   ''You'll never see me in Spandex again, I promise you,'' DiBiase
said.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq at Low for Year; Dow Off 240  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index fell to its low point
for the year today as investors sold technology stocks on fears
that earnings will be hurt by rising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite index was
down 176.47 at 3,213.93, well below its lowest close of the year
--3,321.29 on April 14, when the index sustained a devastating
355.49-point drop. In earlier trading today, the Nasdaq was down
more than 200 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 239.88 at 10,386.97,
having also recovered from an earlier 200-point drop. The Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 index was off 33.40 at 1,373.55.
</P>
<P>
   Bellwether technology companies were continuing a long, steady
slide that has knocked the Nasdaq composite index 35 percent below
its March 10 record. Intel fell 5 1/16 to 112 13/16 and Cisco
Systems fell 2 5/16 to 51[.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said investors appear to have determined that with
interest rates on the rise, the high price of technology stocks may
not be justified by their earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think the correction for technology stocks still has
further to go,'' said Thomas McManus, equity portfolio strategist
at Banc of America Securities in New York. Even the bellwether
names, which attracted investors in the wake of April's technology
selloff, are now under escalating pressure, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had suggested that investors increase the quality and
liquidity of tech stock holdings in anticipation of a sharp
correction, but the risk remains that technology blue-chips become
increasingly overvalued and overowned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq hasn't traded this low since last November, when the
index hit an intraday low of 3,124.77. That marked the start of an
incredible upward path for the index, which ended the year with an
86 percent gain -- the steepest in history for any major stock
index.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts are holding to the view that the current weakness
is washing out the rampant exuberance that dominated the market at
the close of 1999 and in early 2000. But with the damage mounting,
investors are struggling to determine which technology stocks -- if
any -- are worthy of their still-high prices.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market's greatest obstacle remains rising interest
rates, analysts said. Last week, the Federal Reserve raised rates
for the sixth time since last June, and left the door open to
further rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   Recent economic reports have offered a mixed report on whether
the Fed's rate increases are successfully slowing the economy, and
the next major report won't hit the market until Thursday, when the
Commerce Department issues a preliminary report on the gross
domestic product during the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors led the Dow lower, tumbling 9{ to 77{. The
company is allowing shareholders to swap stock for a tracking stock
in Hughes Electronics, a wholly owned subsidiary of GM. The deal is
ultimately expected to boost GM's stock price, and will reduce the
number of GM shares on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of the Hughes tracking stock rose 7[ to 97 in active
trading.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 9-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 402.34 million
shares, slightly behind Friday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index fell 17.67 to 462.03.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 2.8 percent as its
leading technology stocks fell steeply.

<HEADLINE> Justices To Decide Arbitration Role  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether a federal law can be invoked to enforce arbitration
agreements in most labor and employment contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The court said it will hear arguments by Circuit City Stores
that an exception within the Federal Arbitration Act is a narrow
one, and therefore the law can be used to enforce most contract
agreements to arbitrate employment disputes.
</P>
<P>
   The case involves lawsuit filed by Saint Clair Adams, who worked
for Circuit City in Santa Rosa, Calif. When he joined the company
in 1995, he was required to sign a document agreeing to arbitrate
''any and all ... claims, disputes or controversies'' related to
his employment.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Adams sued Circuit City in California state court,
alleging he had suffered on-the-job harassment because of his
sexual orientation in violation of a state fair-employment law.
</P>
<P>
   Circuit City went to federal court, saying the Federal
Arbitration Act required the dispute to be handled through
arbitration rather than a state court lawsuit. A federal judge
agreed, but the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and let
Adams' lawsuit go forward.
</P>
<P>
   The arbitration law states it does not apply to employment
contracts for ''seamen, railroad employees or any other class of
workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   The 9th Circuit court had previously decided that exception
meant the law did not apply to employment or labor contracts.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal acted on today, Circuit City's lawyers said other
appeals courts have read the exception more narrowly to apply only
to workers actually working in the ''movement of goods in
interstate commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams' lawyers said Circuit City's argument would strip state
courts of their power to decide whether such arbitration agreements
are fair.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Circuit City Stores vs. Adams, 99-1379.

<HEADLINE> Lazio picks up backing of Conservative Party leader  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- In a crucial development for his fledgling
Senate campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton, Rep. Rick Lazio
picked up the backing Monday of state Conservative Party Chairman
Michael Long.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be a real race. The difference is there's going
to be a contrast here,'' Long said. ''There's going to be a united
front. Old alliances are going to be working together again.''
</P>
<P>
   Long had earlier refused to get behind the former Republican
standardbearer, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, because of
his support for abortion rights and his closeness to the Liberal
Party.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the boss of the state's Liberal Party came out Monday
''100 percent'' behind the first lady's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no doubt she will emerge as the candidate of the
Liberal Party,'' Liberal Party leader Raymond Harding said.
</P>
<P>
   While no Republican has been elected to statewide office in New
York since 1974 without Conservative Party backing, no Democrat has
been elected governor or U.S. senator in New York without Liberal
Party backing since that party was founded in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other states, New York allows major party candidates to
also count votes from third-party ballot lines. That can be
critical in a close race. In 1994, Republican George Pataki beat
three-term Democratic incumbent Mario Cuomo in the governor's race
on the strength of the vote on the Conservative Party line.
</P>
<P>
   Long's support for Lazio came as the Long Island congressman
continued a two-day whirlwind tour of upstate New York designed to
boost his name recognition quickly in a large state where he is
little known.
</P>
<P>
   After stops in Elmira, Watertown and the Utica area, Lazio was
to be joined for an airport rally Monday in Albany by Gov. George
Pataki, his chief political patron, and by state Republican
Chairman William Powers. Lazio visited Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse
and Binghamton on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It is Pataki who, in the wake of Giuliani's withdrawal from the
Senate race on Friday to concentrate on dealing with his prostate
cancer, has been instrumental in lining up GOP leaders behind
Lazio's resurrected candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Lazio suspended preparations for a Senate run at
Pataki's urging after the governor, under pressure from national
and state GOP leaders, endorsed Giuliani's candidacy. The
congressman fired his campaign machinery up again on Friday,
immediately after Giuliani quit the race.
</P>
<P>
   Harding, meanwhile, has been a top political adviser to Giuliani
and the mayor's withdrawal from the race cleared the way for the
Liberal Party boss to get behind Clinton, as he had been under
pressure to do from party colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   The Conservative and Liberal party state nominating convention
are being held June 3 at which time their leaders' choices are
expected to be ratified.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton campaign quickly used Long's backing of Lazio to
press a favorite new theme of the first lady's team -- that Lazio is
too conservative for New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''Given his conservative record, it's not surprising he would
get the Conservative Party nod,'' Clinton campaign spokesman Howard
Wolfson said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, on the other hand, has been painting Clinton as a
too-liberal Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   While Long said Lazio had some catching up to do with just five
months to go until the election, the Conservative Party leader
predicted the polls would quickly close.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think his chances are really excellent,'' Long said.
</P>
<P>
   A statwide New York Post/Fox News poll out Sunday had Clinton
leading Lazio, 46 percent to 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Long's backing of Lazio came after former U.S. Rep. Joseph
DioGuardi told the party chairman that he would not continue with
his quest for the Conservative Party's Senate nomination. DioGuardi
had entered the fray because of his policy disagreements with
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   DioGuardi said it was clear Lazio was the choice of Republican
and Conservative party leaders for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's in the best position to send Hillary Clinton back to
Arkansas or Washington or wherever she came from ... He's a fine
young man,'' the former congressman from suburban Westchester
County said in endorsing Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   Long had refused to get behind Giuliani's Senate bid because of
the New York City mayor's refusal to come out in favor of a ban on
a late-term abortion procedure that critics call ''partial-birth
abortion'' and the mayor's strong ties to the state's Liberal
Party.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, while maintaining he is an abortion rights supporter,
favors banning the abortion procedure and has never run with
Liberal Party backing.

<HEADLINE> Riders say service on rail line has improved  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Commuters on Metro-North Railroad's New
Haven Line are happier with their service these days, but still not
as satisfied as riders on the Harlem and Hudson lines, a survey
found.
</P>
<P>
   New Haven Line riders were more satisfied with service in the
first three months of this year than in the previous quarter,
according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   Riders gave higher scores in seven out of eight categories for
the January-to-March period.
</P>
<P>
   The highest rating was on-time performance, which was 7.3, up
from a 6.9 rating in the October-to-December period. The ratings
use a 1-to-10 scale, with 10 being the most satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   The only category that went down from last quarter was overall
conditions on trains, which fell from 6.7 to 6.5.
</P>
<P>
   New Haven Line scores have been lower than on the Hudson and
Harlem lines for years. Metro-North officials said the longer
average rides of New Haven Line commuters could be a contributing
factor.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we do poorly on on-time performance, all the categories
tend to suffer due to general unhappiness,'' said Ted Bowen, a
Metro-North customer service official.
</P>
<P>
   Bad weather and faulty equipment on Connecticut trains late last
year also contributed to a poor on-time performance, Metro-North
said. Though the scores have improved, commuters tend to take a
longer time to feel better, Bowen said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lag between when we improve things like on-time
performance and when commuters say they are satisfied,'' he said.
''Perception and reality aren't always on the same schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   When discussing the scores at the Connecticut Metro
North-Shoreline East Commuter Rail Council's monthly meeting last
week, some commuters complained that the New Haven Line should not
settle for lower quality.
</P>
<P>
   ''Things have been better, and on-time is the big one, but our
riders continue to be less satisfied than the Harlem and Hudson
lines,'' said Rodney Chabot, the council's chairman. ''I hope over
time we see that situation addressed and these scores improve.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry Harris, state Department of Transportation's public
transit bureau chief, told the council to keep the ratings in
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ''These scores are still in the seven and eight range,'' Harris
said. ''I can remember years ago when these numbers were fours. So
people are generally satisfied with Metro-North service, with some
bumps along the way.''

<HEADLINE> State AFL-CIO boss asks Connecticut members to boycott blood drives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- With a strike against the state chapter
of the American Red Cross entering its fourth week, the president
of the Connecticut AFL-CIO on Wednesday urged the organization's
265,000 members to boycott blood drives until the dispute is
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The strike involves Red Cross workers who collect and deliver
donated blood. The 200 members of the American Federation of State,
County and Municipal Employees Local 3145 walked out May 1 when the
old contract expired.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their strike is our strike,'' AFL-CIO President John Olsen
said Monday. ''Their struggle is our struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   No negotiations have been held since the second week of the
strike and none were scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're still at an impasse,'' said Red Cross spokeswoman Lynn
Townshend.
</P>
<P>
   Townshend said she was disappointed ''that anyone would try to
hinder blood donations in this state.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she said the Red Cross was attempting to stick to its
revised schedule of one blood drive per day. Since the strike
began, Red Cross officials said the average daily blood collection
has dwindled to about 100 pints, down from 600 units a day.
</P>
<P>
   But the Red Cross says it can still meet the blood-product
demands of 32 Connecticut hospitals by using blood collected
outside the state and managed by the Red Cross system from St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's blood drive was held at the First Presbyterian
Church in New Canaan, Townshend said. Olsen said he hoped no
AFL-CIO member would take part.
</P>
<P>
   ''This strike is about fairness,'' he said. ''It's about workers
who have every right to improve the quality of their own lives when
they've been improving the quality of all our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The union is seeking better pay, benefits, scheduling and
retirement packages. Current pay ranges from $10 to $22 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The strikers say the Red Cross receives $1,000 for each pint of
blood it collects, once the blood is broken down into its various
components. Townshend wouldn't say how much the Red Cross makes on
a pint of blood but did say the union's estimate was ''a bit
high.''
</P>
<P>
   The strike marks the second time the union has walked out
against the Red Cross. The first strike, which occurred in 1975
when AFSCME organized the Red Cross, lasted for two months.

<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Incessant weekend rains triggered
flooding and mudslides that killed 14 people, officials said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve victims died under torrents of earth in Pasto, capital of
southern Narino State, national disaster relief coordinator Eduardo

   The other two deaths were in Putumayo and Santander states.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of families will have to be relocated, Gonzalez said.
Meteorologists also predict more heavy rains.

   Flooding and mudslides commonly cause deaths in Colombia, where
poor people place homes on riverbanks, cliffs or at the foot of

<HEADLINE> Israel Allows Women To Read at Wall  </HEADLINE>
By DINA KRAFT
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- In a groundbreaking decision, the Supreme Court
ruled Monday that women may read aloud from the Torah at the
Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site.
</P>
<P>
   A panel of three judges reinterpreted a law governing Jewish
holy sites and lifted bans on women praying from the Torah scroll,
the Jewish holy text, and wearing the prayer shawl traditionally
worn by men at the holy site.
</P>
<P>
   Ultra-Orthodox Jews say women praying from the Torah violates
Jewish law and the division of roles that God assigned men and
women. Before the ruling, a woman could face a six-month jail
sentence for violating the ban.
</P>
<P>
   Religion Minister Yitzhak Cohen, an ulta-Orthodox Jew, vowed to
submit legislation to override the court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The Western Wall, divided into sections for men and women, is
the only intact remnant of the Jewish Temple destroyed by the
Romans in 70 A.D. It has been a flashpoint between ultra-Orthodox
Jews and more liberal streams of Judaism like the Reform and
Conservative movements that seek to pray at the site.
</P>
<P>
   Anat Hoffman, who appealed on behalf of the organization ''Women
of the Wall,'' called the ruling a turning point in a society where
the ultra-Orthodox control even civil functions like death and
marriage ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was ashamed that I lived in a city and belonged to a
religion where a woman who prays there could be imprisoned for half
a year,'' Hoffman told Israel Radio. ''Today that stain has been
removed.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier attempts by women to conduct services at the Wall have
prompted violent protests by the ultra-Orthodox.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, however, said threats of violence could not
justify denying women the right to pray at the Wall. The court told
the government to make arrangements within six months that would
allow women to read safely from the Torah in the women's section.

<HEADLINE> Michael J. Fox Bids Adieu to Show  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- In this month of series cliffhangers, ''Spin
City'' presents the most gripping: What will the future hold for
Michael J. Fox?
</P>
<P>
   Fox is leaving the ABC sitcom after Wednesday night's season
finale to fight his case of Parkinson's disease, marking the last,
most poignant stop on the farewell tour he has traveled since he
announced his plans in January.
</P>
<P>
   A farewell tour doesn't have to mean forever, of course. And you
can expect to see Fox on ''Spin City'' in an occasional guest
appearance next season (like during ratings sweeps).
</P>
<P>
   But there is an unequivocal finality to this episode. It is
titled ''Goodbye,'' and signals Fox's exit from the 4-year-old
series that was built around his brash, boyish style.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, the March week it was shot ''turned out to be
fairly emotional,'' Fox said. ''I learned how much I love the
people in this show and the verisimilitude there is between my life
and Michael Flaherty's life.''
</P>
<P>
   Flaherty is the character Fox plays -- the deputy mayor of New
York who this week takes the fall for a scandal that could sink the
entire city administration. On the plus side, he is carnally
rewarded for his self-sacrifice by Caitlin (Heather Locklear), his
former colleague and new love.
</P>
<P>
   The episode gives Fox an efficient send-off. In return, he
rallies his diminished energies, if all too visibly, for a bravura
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers can listen for real-life parallels embedded in the
dialogue:
</P>
<P>
   -- ''I know the system,'' declares Flaherty/Fox. (Political?
Medical?)
</P>
<P>
   -- ''I'll survive this.'' (His professional setback? His
Parkinson's?)
</P>
<P>
   -- ''It's not like it's over, right?''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most affecting cloaked references comes from the
courtly, befuddled Mayor Winston, played by Barry Bostwick.
</P>
<P>
   ''The years that we've been working together, they've been the
best years of my life,'' the mayor tells his deputy. ''Even during
the tough times, I could always count on you.''
</P>
<P>
   This speech rings with truth when you recall that, after ''Spin
City'' premiered in 1996, Bostwick underwent treatment for prostate
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the feelings that pervade this episode for cast and
audience alike are insufficient to raise it above what ''Spin
City'' has been from the start. A series that has never won an Emmy
and currently occupies 41st place in the ratings for the season,
its main distinction has always been the actor it's now losing.
</P>
<P>
   Now the series Fox is leaving behind will leave New York, to
shoot on a Los Angeles sound stage next season. Charlie Sheen will
join the cast.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's finale, Flaherty reflects on his sudden
joblessness.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every morning,'' he says, ''I wake up and I got somewhere to
go, I got something to do. What am I going to do tomorrow when the
alarm goes off?''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Fox knows pretty well what he's going to be
doing for his foreseeable tomorrows. He will devote more time to
his new career as an advocate for research into finding a cure for
Parkinson's, a progressive neurological disorder. The 38-year-old
star says he expects a cure by the time he is 50.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has insisted that he isn't giving up show business. But as
he told Diane Sawyer on ''20/20'' last week, ''it takes a different
degree of energy and concentration for me to do things than for you
to do things.''
</P>
<P>
   He explained that as an actor with Parkinson's disease playing
someone who doesn't have Parkinson's, he is consumed with ''doing
the math on how to physically navigate my way through a scene.''
</P>
<P>
   ''As a performer,'' he said, ''I want people to see what I'm
performing, not the dexterity and gymnastics it was taking for me
to perform it.''

<HEADLINE> AP Reviews Guare's 'Lydie Breeze'  </HEADLINE>
By MARY CAMPBELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- From playwright John Guare, who gave us ''The
House of Blue Leaves'' and ''Six Degrees of Separation,'' one would
expect better than the long and tedious ''Lydie Breeze,'' his new
off-Broadway production at the New York Theater Workshop.
</P>
<P>
   It's really two plays, each 2{ hours long. The first is
subtitled ''Bulfinch's Mythology.'' The second, ''The Sacredness of
the Next Task,'' has more tangents than a trigonometry lesson.
Guare apparently intended to fashion Greek tragedy into a modern
family saga, but he has failed to make his people interesting.
</P>
<P>
   The first play begins with Lydie Breeze (Elizabeth Marvel), a
nurse, arriving on Nantucket Island in 1875 to start a utopian
community with three men she chose from Civil War hospitals. One of
them, Joshua Hickman (Bill Camp), she marries; the second, Amos
Mason (Boris McGiver), is a laborer; the third, Dan Grady (Matt
Servitto), is a railroad worker who comes home with money he took
from a dead man on a train. Lydie Breeze falls in love with him.
</P>
<P>
   The second act is set in the print shop in a Boston prison where
Hickman is serving time for murdering Grady. Mason, having gone to
Harvard law school and become a lawyer with political aspirations,
visits Hickman to dissuade him from publishing his book about the
utopian experiment.
</P>
<P>
   In the second play, set on Nantucket in 1895, there are three
suicides, a ghost, a rape combined with mistaken identity, several
cases of syphilis, and some laughs, possibly unintended. And yet
for all the action and plot trajectories, it rarely gets
interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Grady's actor son Jeremiah (Jefferson Mays) returns to spout
some monologues from his role as Frankenstein's monster. Lydie
Breeze's two daughters appear, in unfortunate circumstances. Each
is saved by a man who appears at the last minute -- Alexandra Oliver
by Christopher McCann, playing an inventor, and Alicia Goranson by
Thomas Shaw, playing a bird bander.
</P>
<P>
   A bird bander is someone who puts bands on birds to track them
and measure far they fly. Played by Shaw, it's the production's one
appealing role, but it's a small one, near the end, and is hardly
worth waiting for.

<HEADLINE> Bobby Brown Ordered Held in Jail  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Singer Bobby Brown was ordered
Monday to remain in jail until a hearing is held June 19 on whether
he violated his probation stemming from a drunken driving charge.
</P>
<P>
   Brown smiled and shook his head after Circuit Judge Leonard
Feiner refused to grant him bond.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not fair man, it's not fair,'' Brown told his attorney,
Bruce Lyons, after the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's wife, singer Whitney Houston, did not attend.
</P>
<P>
   Brown spent five days in jail in 1998 and was placed on
probation for a year after he was convicted of drunken driving in a
1996 accident. A warrant was issued for Brown's arrest last June
after his probation officer said Brown tested positive for cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who has a home in Mendham, N.J., was arrested May 10 at
the airport in Newark, N.J., as he and Houston arrived from the
Bahamas. He was then returned to Florida, where he has been held at
the Broward County Jail without bond.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Falls to Low for the Year  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index continued its steady
decline today, falling nearly 150 points as investors sold
technology stocks on fears that earnings will be hurt by rising
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the
Nasdaq was down 144.35 at 3,246.05. With the decline, the Nasdaq
has wiped out virtually all the spectacular gains it piled on from
early November until March 10, when it peaked at 5,048.62.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have decided that their exuberance for high-tech and
Internet stocks -- which gave the Nasdaq an unprecedented 86 percent
gain last year -- was either unjustified or premature, given the
upward trend in interest rates, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   The weakness in the Nasdaq spread throughout the market today.
The Dow Jones industrial average was down 189.16 at 10,437.69,
having clawed back from a loss of more than 250 points. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was off 24.39 at 1,382.56.
</P>
<P>
   Bellwether technology companies were continuing a long, steady
slide that has knocked the Nasdaq composite index 37 percent below
its March 10 record close of 5,048.62. Intel fell 3~ to 114 and
Cisco Systems fell 1] to 52 1/16. Oracle fell 5{ to 64 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said investors have determined that with interest rates
on the rise, the high price of technology stocks may not be
justified by their earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think the correction for technology stocks still has
further to go,'' said Thomas McManus, equity portfolio strategist
at Banc of America Securities in New York. Even the bellwether
names, which attracted investors in the wake of April's technology
selloff, are now under escalating pressure, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had suggested that investors increase the quality and
liquidity of tech stock holdings in anticipation of a sharp
correction, but the risk remains that technology blue-chips become
increasingly overvalued and overowned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts are holding to the view that the current weakness
is washing out the exuberance that dominated the market at the
close of 1999 and in early 2000. But with the damage mounting,
investors are struggling to determine which technology stocks -- if
any -- are worthy of their still-high prices.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said many of the Internet retailers and other fledgling
companies that racked up steep stock prices at the height of the
technology boom may never recover. More established companies,
however, remain solid investments and are becoming relative
bargains in the continuing tech washout.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fundamentals of the technology sector are still there,''
said Michael K. Farr, president of investment counselors Farr,
Miller &AMP; Washington in Washington, D.C. ''But no longer will being
a 'dot com' get you a following. You have to have strong, growing
earnings and a clear business plan.''
</P>
<P>
   The stock market's greatest obstacle remains rising interest
rates, analysts said. Last week, the Federal Reserve raised rates
for the sixth time since last June, and left the door open to
further rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   Recent economic reports have offered a mixed report on whether
the Fed's rate increases are successfully slowing the economy, and
the next major report won't hit the market until Thursday, when the
Commerce Department issues a preliminary report on the gross
domestic product during the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors led the Dow lower, tumbling 8~ to 78[. The
company is allowing shareholders to swap stock for a tracking stock
in Hughes Electronics, a wholly owned subsidiary of GM. The deal is
ultimately expected to boost GM's stock price, and will reduce the
number of GM shares on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of the Hughes tracking stock rose 6 9/16 to 96 7/16 in
active trading.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 663.84 million
shares, slightly behind Friday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The relatively light volume was a clear contrast to the waves of
selling that dragged the Nasdaq lower in April. Analysts said there
was no sign of panic in the market. Yet many believe that it would
take a high-volume, full-bore selloff to drive the Nasdaq to a
level that would attract bargain hunters and allow the index to
rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 16.61 to
463.09.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 2.8 percent as its
leading technology stocks fell steeply.

<HEADLINE> Convicted War Criminal Testifies  </HEADLINE>
By ANTHONY DEUTSCH
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- A convicted Bosnian war criminal
who admitted murdering Muslims in the Bosnian war testified Monday
against his former commander, Serb Gen. Radislav Krstic.
</P>
<P>
   Drazen Erdemovic told the U.N. tribunal said he saw Bosnian Serb
military police ordering Muslims off buses at the execution site --
the Branjevo farm in the protected U.N. enclave of Srebrenica in
July 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''When the (Muslim) men turned their backs to us, we were
ordered to shoot. ... There were between 1,000 and 1,200 of them,''
Erdemovic testified.
</P>
<P>
   Erdemovic, 28, was sentenced in March 1998 to five years
imprisonment after pleading guilty to taking part in the Srebrenica
executions.
</P>
<P>
   He returned voluntarily to testify in Krstic's genocide trial
after serving two years in pretrial custody and a shortened
sentence in a Norwegian jail. He is now in the tribunal's protected
witness program; the date of his release was not given.
</P>
<P>
   Serb forces broke through U.N. defenses at the so-called ''safe
haven'' of Srebrenica on July 11, 1995. In the next week they
slaughtered at least 7,500 Muslim men and boys, prosecutors say.
Krstic is accused of leading the army's Drina Corps, which
allegedly carried out the bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said I didn't want to do it,'' said Erdemovic, a Bosnian
Croat married to a Serb woman who first fought with Muslim forces.
He says he was forced to join the Bosnian Serb army or face
expulsion from Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   If he hadn't participated in the murders at Branjevo farm, a
military agricultural settlement, Erdemovic said he would have had
to ''stand up with them'' and be shot alongside the Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were terrible moments,'' Erdemovic said.
</P>
<P>
   Krstic's trial reopened Monday after a five-week recess.
Testimony in coming weeks will focus on the Serb command structure
during the massacres.
</P>
<P>
   Krstic, 52, has pleaded innocent to charges of genocide, war
crimes, crimes against humanity and grave breaches of the Geneva
Conventions. He could spend the rest of his life in prison if found
guilty of any single charge.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal was established seven years ago by the U.N.
Security Council to prosecute those responsible for atrocities in
the Balkans following the disintegration of Yugoslavia in 1991. It
has sentenced 14 Serb, Muslim and Croat defendants to prison terms
of up to 45 years. The tribunal has no death penalty.

<HEADLINE> Nation Faces Geriatrician Shortage  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Doctors diagnosed dementia in an 80-year-old
woman when in fact depression caused her memory loss. Once she
finally saw specialists who uncovered and treated the depression,
her memory rebounded.
</P>
<P>
   The heart drug verapamil caused another patient severe
constipation. Doctors didn't make the connection, instead
prescribing laxatives too strong for an elderly person, leaving her
dangerously dehydrated. Again it took specialists to solve the real
problem and switch her heart medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The specialists here are geriatricians, doctors trained to care
for the elderly in an era when the health care system is poorly
equipped to handle their myriad, complex medical problems. But good
luck finding one: Even as the nation is bracing for the number of
elderly to soar, there's a critical shortage of geriatricians.
</P>
<P>
   ''We get at least 100 phone calls a week'' from families
desperately hunting one, says Linda Hiddemen Barondess of the
Foundation for Health in Aging.
</P>
<P>
   With the shortage unlikely to ease soon, the American Geriatrics
Society is launching new programs to train surgeons and general
practitioners to improve their care for older patients, and to help
families recognize quality elder care.
</P>
<P>
   Treating the elderly, especially the very old, can be remarkably
different than treating younger patients. In fact, seniors often
don't have the usual symptoms a younger person would show for the
same disease.
</P>
<P>
   Take heart attacks. Less than half of elderly people report the
chest pain most middle-aged victims feel. Instead they may complain
of vague symptoms such as labored breathing, numbness, tingling or
dizziness.
</P>
<P>
   Or consider congestive heart failure. It may cause leg swelling
that slows an older person's walking long before the telltale
shortness of breath most doctors are looking for.
</P>
<P>
   Add more hurdles: Many drugs work differently in the elderly,
who typically take multiple medicines. Seniors often have numerous
chronic diseases, and a treatment that helps one can worsen
another. There's poor coordination between doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Geriatricians are specially trained to deal with those unique
senior problems, and coordinate proper care among competing
specialists. Yet there are only about 9,500 certified
geriatricians, less than half the estimated 20,000 needed to care
for the frailest of the 34 million elderly Americans.
</P>
<P>
   As for other doctors, a survey found one-third of recent medical
school graduates believed their eldercare instruction was
inadequate. By 2030, the American Geriatrics Society estimates more
than 36,000 geriatricians will be needed as the over-65 population
approaches 70 million. The more fragile over-85 population will
more than quadruple to 18 million by 2050.
</P>
<P>
   Not all seniors need a geriatrician.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most older people are actually very healthy'' and regular
doctors do fine, says Dr. Kenneth Brummel-Smith of Portland, Ore.'s
Providence Health System, the society's president-elect.
</P>
<P>
   But about 20 percent of seniors are very frail or have multiple
complex conditions. These are the patients geriatricians help.
</P>
<P>
   Now the society is working to train other doctors about elderly
patients' unusual needs, starting with surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Surgery poses classic dilemmas, Brummel-Smith says. A
healthy 80-year-old, for example, can undergo bypass surgery as
successfully as a younger person, yet some surgeons are reluctant
to operate on the old. On the other hand, studies show older
patients suffer more complications while hospitalized, so for an
octagenarian with numerous health problems, ''the real question is
'Should we fix it?''' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the question of minimizing special risks, such as
the memory loss and confusion seniors can suffer, sometimes for
months, after a bypass. ''It's surprising to me, in talking to
heart surgeons, how frequently they see postoperative delirium as a
normal part of aging,'' Brummel-Smith says. In fact, numerous steps
-- from adequate hydration to medication choices -- can decrease that
risk.
</P>
<P>
   The society also is starting to set quality eldercare guidelines
and educate patients.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they live in an area where there truly are not
geriatricians, older people can do a very good thing for
themselves: Learn more about what they should expect from their
doctor,'' so they can demand quality care, Brummel-Smith advised.

<HEADLINE> Bolivia Pledges Coca Destruction  </HEADLINE>
By ADALID CABRERA LEMUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) -- Bolivia brushed aside threats of strikes
and blockades by coca leaf producers and pledged Monday to continue
destroying the plantations used to make cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 10,000 peasants gathered over the weekend in El Chapare
in the heart of Bolivia's coca-growing country and set a 30-day
deadline for the government to stop the destruction of their crops.
</P>
<P>
   Peasant leader Evo Morales warned the peasants would blockade
roads, seize villages, go on hunger strikes and organize massive
marches on La Paz if the government does not stop targeting their
coca crops.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Guillermo Fortun said drug traffickers are
behind the peasant leaders' threats and the soldiers and police
won't stop eradicating the coca crops.
</P>
<P>
   ''We aim at reaching the year 2002 when the mandate of President
(Hugo) Banzer expires, having destroyed almost all the
plantations,'' Fortun said.
</P>
<P>
   Fortun said hundreds of coca growers who staged violent protests
in Cochabamba, Bolivia's third-largest city, in March had ''all
their expenses paid by the traffickers'' -- an accusation denied by
the peasant leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The coca leaf destruction program started in August 1997 as part
of efforts to take Bolivia out of the cocaine making and
trafficking circuit. The United States government has supported the
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Bolivia is the world's third-largest cocaine producer after
Colombia and Peru. Its production averages 70 tons a year, down
from 250 tons before the eradication program.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the government sent thousands of soldiers and police
to El Chapare to destroy plantations, triggering clashes with
peasants that killed at least 12 people in the region 480 miles
east of La Paz.
</P>
<P>
   The government said it succeeded in destroying 44,400 acres out
of 71,510 acres targeted for eradication.
</P>
<P>
   Fortun admitted that the eradication plan hurts nearly 200,000
peasants who make a living out of coca growing.
</P>
<P>
   But he said they are increasingly accepting a
government-sponsored program to develop alternative crops, such as
coffee and bananas.
</P>
<P>
   Peasant leaders complain that the government has failed to
create markets for their new crops.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Actions Summary  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   The Supreme Court took these actions Monday:
<TEXT>
<P>
   --Struck down, 5-4, a federal law that shielded children from
sex-oriented cable TV channels. Citing the Constitution's
free-speech protection, the justices said Congress cannot require
cable operators to restrict sexually explicit programming to
overnight hours to minimize the chance that children will see or
hear channels only partly scrambled for nonsubscribers.
</P>
<P>
   --Set the stage for a major environmental ruling, agreeing to
decide whether the government went too far in adopting tougher
nationwide clean-air standards. A lower court blocked the
Environmental Protection Agency from enforcing rules adopted in
1997 to reduce smog and soot nationwide. A ruling is expected
sometime in 2001. The government said the case carries ''profound
implications for the health of the American public.''
</P>
<P>
   --Narrowed a key whistle-blower law, saying people cannot use the
federal False Claims Act to file lawsuits that accuse a state of
cheating the federal government. The 7-2 decision in a Vermont case
upheld the right of private citizens to file fraud lawsuits on the
federal government's behalf. But the justices said the law protects
the states from being sued.
</P>
<P>
   --Ruled 5-4 that people injured in accidents involving cars built
before federal rules required air bags cannot sue automakers for
failing to install air bags. The ruling in a District of Columbia
case said federal auto-safety regulations block such lawsuits filed
under state product-liability laws.
</P>
<P>
   --Let stand a ruling that may force airlines to pay a lot more to
some passengers whose luggage was lost or damaged. The justices
turned down an American Airlines appeal that sought to limit how
much it may have to pay for suitcases that disappeared, or arrived
empty, during a family's trip from the District of Columbia to the
Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   --Turned down the tobacco industry's attempt to replace the
Florida judge presiding over the nation's only statewide lawsuit
that seeks damages for hundreds of thousands of people with
smoking-related injuries.
</P>
<P>
   --Narrowed the scope of a federal anti-arson law, throwing out an
Indiana man's federal conviction for setting a fire at his cousin's
home. Arson of a private home generally is not subject to federal
prosecution, the court's unanimous ruling said.

<HEADLINE> Norwegian Delegation in Sri Lanka  </HEADLINE>
By KRISHNAN GURUSWAMY
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- The Sri Lankan army and air force
attacked Tamil rebel positions on Monday even as a Norwegian
delegation met Sri Lanka's foreign minister to try to broker a
peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian Deputy Foreign Minister Raymond Johansen held talks
with Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar hours after flying to
Colombo, the capital, on a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
   A government statement said more than 150 rebels were killed in
fighting that raged Sunday and Monday for control of the key
northern peninsula of Jaffna. It said the bodies of 68 guerrillas
were recovered in the battlefields in Chavakachcheri, a strategic
region east of Jaffna city, the former rebel capital.
</P>
<P>
   Independent confirmation was not possible since journalists are
not allowed into the war zone and news about the battle is
censored.
</P>
<P>
   In Colombo, Kadirgamar and Johansen shook hands and posed for
photographers at the start of a closed-door meeting. Johansen was
accompanied by Erik Solheim, Oslo's special envoy to Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
   Johansen later met President Chandrika Kumaratunga to try to
find ways to end the 17-year-old war that has killed more than
62,000 people in the Indian Ocean nation off India.
</P>
<P>
   Solheim, who visited neighboring India last week as part of
Norway's peace initiative, reportedly is in touch with leaders of
the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam through the rebels' London
office.
</P>
<P>
   Norway, home of the Nobel Peace Prize, has frequently used
backdoor diplomacy to resolve some of the world's most difficult
conflicts. Norwegian diplomats helped mediate the 1993 peace accord
between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Former Norwegian Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek visited Sri
Lanka in February after Kumaratunga sought Oslo's help in resuming
talks with the rebels after a five-year suspension.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have claimed several battle successes in recent
weeks. The government says it has deployed modern weapons to
contain the rebel threat.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a police officer who crushed India's Sikh uprising
arrived in Colombo to advise Sri Lanka's government on fighting the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   K.P.S. Gill, who retired as chief of police in India's northern
Punjab state, is expected to work with Sri Lankan police and
military officials to draw up a strategy to counter the Tamil Tiger
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Tamil political parties urged both the government and the rebels
on Monday to agree to a cease-fire to help the peace negotiators
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The time is ripe for the hostilities to end and start talks,''
said Douglas Devananda of the Eelam Peoples Democratic Party, a
former rebel group that has renounced violence and joined the
mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas have been fighting for a separate homeland for
Tamils since 1983, accusing the majority Sinhalese of widespread
discrimination in education and jobs. The Sinhalese control the
government and the military.

<HEADLINE> Court Blocks Some Air Bag Lawsuits  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court says millions of Americans
who drive or ride in cars built before federal regulations required
air bags cannot, if they get hurt in accidents, sue automakers for
not installing the safety devices.
</P>
<P>
   Voting 5-4 Monday, the court said federal regulation of
automobile safety pre-empts, or blocks, lawsuits in which people
invoke state product-liability laws and contend air bags could have
saved them from harm.
</P>
<P>
   The decision killed the lawsuit of a District of Columbia woman
who suffered serious head injuries when she crashed her 1987 Honda.
</P>
<P>
   ''The basic question ... is whether a common-law 'no air bag'
action like the one before us actually conflicts with (federal
regulation),'' Justice Stephen B. Breyer wrote for the court. ''We
hold that it does.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in September 1989, carmakers had to protect the driver
with ''either an air bag or automatic seat belt.'' A lengthy
phase-in period followed, and cars made since September 1997 must
have air bags for the driver and front-seat passenger.
</P>
<P>
   Alexis Geier's Honda Accord had a seat belt and shoulder
harness, which she was wearing, when in 1992 her car went out of
control on a curve and struck a tree.
</P>
<P>
   Her 1995 lawsuit said the car was defective because it did not
have a driver's side air bag even though federal regulations did
not require one when the car was manufactured.
</P>
<P>
   American Honda Motor Co. successfully fought off Geier's lawsuit
in lower courts by arguing that a federal law and regulation shield
it from liability. The Supreme Court agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's decision focused narrowly on air bag technology and
regulation, and did not appear to carry immediate impact for
lawsuits over other alleged defects.
</P>
<P>
   The air bag issue had split lower courts. Five of them and the
highest courts of two states -- Pennsylvania and Mississippi -- had
barred such lawsuits. But the highest courts in five states -- New
Hampshire, Indiana, Arizona, Ohio and New York -- had allowed them.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Breyer to form the court's slender majority were Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor,
Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Clarence Thomas and
Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented.

<HEADLINE> AP Reviews 'Swan Lake'  </HEADLINE>
By MARY CAMPBELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Every ''Swan Lake,'' it seems, is open to
interpretation. Rudolf Nureyev sat himself down in a chair, went to
sleep and dreamed the whole thing. The New York City Ballet's
version, a year ago, stressed the formal over the romantic.
Broadway's 1998 version featured an all-male cast.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes Kevin McKenzie's production for American Ballet
Theater, in which two men dance Rothbart, giving a whole new
dimension to the evil magician in Tchaikovsky's masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   This ''Swan Lake,'' beautifully danced and costumed, had its
premiere March 24 at Kennedy Center and was danced for the first
time in New York Friday night at the Metropolitan Opera.
</P>
<P>
   McKenzie keeps much of the 1895 production as it was
choreographed by Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov. He adds a prologue,
which choreographer Vladimir Bourmeister did in Moscow in 1953, in
which Rothbart captures Odette and turns her into a swan.
</P>
<P>
   In his prologue, Odette (Susan Jaffe) is seen through a
translucent curtain being grabbed and carried away by a large,
ungainly man (Brian Reeder). He is one Rothbart; the other is a
dazzling dancer (Vladimir Malakhov).
</P>
<P>
   In Act 3, when the Black Swan tricks the prince into thinking
she's the swan he loves, Malakhov's solos nearly steal the show.
The prince, danced by Jose Manuel Carreno, dances splendidly, his
jumps high and clean. But whenever Malakhov's Rothbart is seen,
he's doing something spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   Jaffe is a very special Odette, able to make her arms ripple.
When, as a swan, she first meets the prince, her movements show
fright. As she comes to love and trust him, she is like an
unfolding flower.
</P>
<P>
   McKenzie has modified the fouettes -- whipping turns -- which are
in the original choreography and are too fast for most ballerinas.
The costumes are sumptuous in the Act 1 scene of the prince's
birthday party, where his mother (Georgina Parkinson) tells him he
must marry, and in Act 3 in ball, where he is to choose a bride.
Yan Chen, Sandra Brown and Herman Cornejo danc an exceptionally
fine pas de trois in Act 1.
</P>
<P>
   In Act 2, where the prince meets Odette by the lake, McKenzie
arranges the excellent corps de ballet of swans differently from
the usual.
</P>
<P>
   Endings of ''Swan Lake'' vary, from Rothbart dying and melting
down to the lovers riding across the sky in what looks like Santa's
sleigh. McKenzie has devised a new ending, in which first Odette
and then the prince dive from a high rock into the lake. It's a
hugely dramatic finale, after which the couple's resurrection
inside a large rising moon is almost anticlimactic.

<HEADLINE> Tropical Storm Forms Off Acapulco  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The first tropical depression of the year
formed Monday in the Pacific off the coast of Acapulco, but was not
expected to hit land.
</P>
<P>
   The depression, with winds gusting at about 35 mph, was expected
to move west-northwest over the next few days and to stay away from
the Mexican coast, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center
in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The depression was forecast to strengthen, though, in which case
it could take a more northerly track toward the coast, possibly
becoming a tropical storm later Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Storms are classified as tropical depressions when their winds
are below 39 mph, tropical storms when the winds range from 39 to
73 mph, and hurricanes when the winds exceed 73 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's tropical depression marked the first storm of the
eastern Pacific hurricane season, which officially begins June 1.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted
11 tropical storms this year, seven of which will be hurricanes,
three of them major.
</P>
<P>
   The La Nina cooling of water in the Pacific Ocean -- the same
condition that influenced the 1999 season -- remains in place this
year, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Lobbying on MTBE bill before Pataki intensifies  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER JORDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Lobbying over a bill to ban MTBE, a gasoline
additive intended to reduce air pollution but blamed for
contaminating water supplies, has been intense in the days before
Gov. George Pataki decides whether to sign the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's office on Monday had no comment on the bill approved by
both houses of the Legislature. He has until Wednesday to sign or
veto the bill. The governor has said he prefers a federal approach
to the MTBE -- or methyl tertiary butyl ether -- problem, but is
''taking a look'' at the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''MTBE has become one of the most prominent contaminants in
groundwater and surface waters in New York and across the nation,''
Sarah Meyland, the Citizen's Campaign for the Environment's
executive director, said in a statement. A ban would ''set an
important example for other states ... and ultimately, this will
force the federal government to address the issue,'' Meyland
continued.
</P>
<P>
   The American Lung Association and a coalition of other states'
environmental officials, on the other hand, are pushing to let the
federal government handle the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know our position makes us as popular as a skunk at an
environmentalists' garden party,'' said Peter Iwanowicz, director
of environmental health for the American Lung Association's New
York chapter. However, he said that the current bill plays into the
interests of producers of ethanol, which is made from corn.
</P>
<P>
   Both MTBE and ethanol make gasoline burn cleaner by adding
oxygen to it. But ethanol also has drawbacks -- it can erode ozone.
</P>
<P>
   The American Lung Association says that banning MTBE without
other safeguards would ''present an unacceptable risk of increased
air pollution.'' The lung association also said that if Congress
doesn't act, a phase out in New York may be appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, which
includes officials from Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New
Hampshire, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Vermont, is also opposed to
the bill before Pataki. ''It is unnecessary and unacceptable to
improve water quality at the cost of undermining clean air and
public health,'' the group said in a statement. That group also
said the use of ethanol in the summer would increase air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Citizens Campaign for the Environment on Monday
displayed the names of 25,000 residents who support a ban.
</P>
<P>
   ''We see no downside to signing this bill,'' said Robert Foster,
legislative director of Citizens Campaign for the Environment. ''My
understanding is (MTBE) is not as effective as intended. The clean
air benefits are not that well documented.'' Foster also suggested
that not banning MTBE would essentially be yielding to the oil
industry.
</P>
<P>
   MTBE is used in one-third of gasoline sold in the United States,
primarily in areas with smog problems. It has leaked in areas
across New York state but Long Island has been a noted trouble
spot. Several counties in and around New York City are required to
use such oxygenated gas.
</P>
<P>
   A European study in the mid-1990s linked MTBE to liver and
kidney tumors in mice. The danger to humans is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   California -- the nation's No. 1 user of MTBE -- has banned MTBE
by the end of 2002. An Environmental Protection Agency panel has
recommended strengthening programs to reduce MTBE's presence in
drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   New York's Department of Environmental Conservation has listed
about 1,700 MTBE spills around the state, although not all the
spills have contaminated water supplies. The DEC did not
immediately comment on its recommendation to the governor.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, New York's legislation would go into effect Jan. 1,
2004.

<HEADLINE> AM-CT--Red Cross Strike, 1st Ld-Writethru,400  </HEADLINE>
State AFL-CIO boss asks Connecticut members to boycott blood
drives   
sdhofonrh
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- With a strike against the state chapter
of the American Red Cross entering its fourth week, the president
of the Connecticut AFL-CIO on Monday urged the organization's
265,000 members to boycott blood drives until the dispute is
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The strike involves Red Cross workers who collect and deliver
donated blood. The 200 members of the American Federation of State,
County and Municipal Employees Local 3145 walked out May 1 when the
old contract expired.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their strike is our strike,'' AFL-CIO President John Olsen
said Monday. ''Their struggle is our struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   No talks have been held since the second week of the strike, but
negotiations were scheduled to resume at 1 p.m. on Thursday at a
site yet to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're still at an impasse,'' said Red Cross spokeswoman Lynn
Townshend.
</P>
<P>
   Townshend said she was disappointed ''that anyone would try to
hinder blood donations in this state.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she said the Red Cross was attempting to stick to its
revised schedule of one blood drive per day. Since the strike
began, Red Cross officials said the average daily blood collection
has dwindled to about 100 pints, down from 600 units a day.
</P>
<P>
   But the Red Cross says it can still meet the blood-product
demands of 32 Connecticut hospitals by using blood collected
outside the state and managed by the Red Cross system from St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's blood drive was held at the First Presbyterian
Church in New Canaan, Townshend said. Olsen said he hoped no
AFL-CIO member would take part.
</P>
<P>
   ''This strike is about fairness,'' he said. ''It's about workers
who have every right to improve the quality of their own lives when
they've been improving the quality of all our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The union is seeking better pay, benefits, scheduling and
retirement packages. Current pay ranges from $10 to $22 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The strikers say the Red Cross receives $1,000 for each pint of
blood it collects, once the blood is broken down into its various
components. Townshend wouldn't say how much the Red Cross makes on
a pint of blood but did say the union's estimate was ''a bit
high.''
</P>
<P>
   The strike marks the second time the union has walked out
against the Red Cross. The first strike, which occurred in 1975
when AFSCME organized the Red Cross, lasted for two months.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Leader Nixes Truce Appeal  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW ENGLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   BARENTU, Eritrea (AP)-- Sneaking around heavily defended ridges
where enemy soldiers were braced for a head-on attack, Ethiopia's
10-day-old offensive into Eritrea so far has overwhelmed -- and
humiliated -- its neighbor with surprising ease.
</P>
<P>
   Ground that Eritrean troops held last week, seemingly secure in
miles of trenches and bunkers they spent years preparing, is now
thick with the debris of war, Eritrean corpses, and victorious,
confident Ethiopian soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ''A few days earlier the enemy had declared that passing these
ridges would be like putting a tank shell through the eye of a
needle,'' scoffed Ethiopian Maj. Shegaw Guale, pointing proudly to
two key, captured hills.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi on Monday rejected appeals
to call an end to his country's offensive to allow for peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   ''We shall negotiate while we fight and we shall fight while we
negotiate,'' Meles declared before African diplomats in Addis
Ababa, the Ethiopian capital. Envoys from the Organization of
African Unity and European Union failed to achieve any immediate
progress in shuttling between the two capitals Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia maintains its objectives are to destroy the Eritrean
army, secure border territory it claims as its own, then withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   Meles defended the invasion Monday as ''the stick'' that would
finally goad Eritrea into settling the on-and-off 2-year-old war
that has drained the resources of two of the world's poorest
countries.
</P>
<P>
   On May 18, faced with four Eritrean infantry divisions dug deep
into the steep, rocky hillsides overlooking the strategic town of
Barentu, Maj. Shegaw engaged his enemy from behind to secure
Ethiopia's most crucial victory yet.
</P>
<P>
   Shegaw's soldiers attacked a village at the bottom of the peaks,
sneaked up the hills and locked in a fierce two-day infantry battle
supported by air and heavy artillery.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia's strategy has been to skirt fortifications and isolate
points of attack, blocking any rescue by Eritrea. The strategy was
developed over a year of planning by the army, military experts
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ethiopia trained specifically for this fight,'' said one
Western military analyst who spoke Monday in Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
   ''They built a training regime to the level of an elite fighting
force, very tough and ready to march,'' the analyst said, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea's fighters won renown as guerrillas during a 30-year
struggle for independence from Ethiopia that achieved its goal in
1993. But the country so far has proven no match against its
much-larger neighbor in more conventional warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Eritrea's army trucks -- their frames twisted by missiles,
tank fire and mines -- sit at the side of the road that winds its
way to Barentu, which until days ago was the country's northwest
command center.
</P>
<P>
   In one truck, two scorched corpses sprawl over the burnt
dashboard. Shattered rifles and body parts of other Eritrean
soldiers surround the drought-cracked earth around the charred
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Ethiopia and Eritrea both reported fighting overnight
along the eastern border crossing of Bure and elsewhere. It was
impossible to immediately verify any of their rival claims of
attacks repulsed and heavy losses inflicted.
</P>
<P>
   The two nations are believed to have spent $1 million a day --
each -- arming and manning for battle.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia's largely volunteer army swelled from 60,000 to 350,000
since the war began in 1998. Eritrea's largely conscripted army
made similar gains, growing to 250,000 to 300,000 in a nation of 4
million.
</P>
<P>
   While the war officially is over borders, personal rivalry
between their leaders is thought to have much to do with the bloody
refusal to come to terms.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier rounds of the war cost tens of thousands of lives. No
one knows how many have perished in the latest offensive, although
it is estimated to have sent more than half a million Eritreans
fleeing from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopian Col. Gedre Kidane, a commander on the western front,
insisted the reasons for success go beyond strategy and arms for
Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are an ancient country and have defended our country very
effectively ourselves, almost without parallel,'' Kidane said.
</P>
<P>
   But the fight now, if it continues, goes into the far higher,
rougher land that is the stronghold around Eritrea's capital -- and
no one knows how the battle would go there.

<HEADLINE> Jackson to S. Leone Rebels: Disarm  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY DUNPHY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sierra Leone's rebels should disarm
voluntarily or be disarmed because continued violence in the West
African nation poses a threat to regional stability, President
Clinton's special envoy to the region said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the United States to report to Clinton, civil
rights activist Jesse Jackson in a telephone interview also called
on Congress to provide financial support for efforts to bring peace
to Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   ''Holding up resources jeopardizes more lives,'' Jackson said.
''If U.S. troops are not going in, then the burden is on Congress
to provide financial support for allies who are ready to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the State Department and U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
called on Monday for the lifting of a U.S legislative hold on $226
million for U.N. peacekeeping activities, including those in Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also criticized the reported killing of more U.N.
peacekeepers in Sierra Leone by the rebels, saying it shows ''the
contempt they have for democracy. They must be held accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   After visiting Nigeria, Mali and Liberia over the weekend,
Jackson said Nigeria was ready to lead a regional force which would
try to halt fighting between the rebels and government forces in
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   ''But these troops must have a peace enforcement mandate, not a
peacekeeping mandate,'' Jackson said. ''Otherwise they will be
targets'' for the rebels of the Sierra Leone Revolutionary United
Front.
</P>
<P>
   ''The RUF must disarm and demobilize voluntarily or be disarmed
and demobilized,'' Jackson said. ''They must not retain military
power because that threatens democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the continued fighting in Sierra Leone could ''create a
domino effect of instability in the region'' threatening Guinea,
where 700,000 refugees have fled from Sierra Leone, and Liberia
where some rebel leaders are based.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a real obligation to secure democracy in Sierra
Leone,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Bill Calls for Filmmaker Park Fees  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bill passed by the House Monday could
require moviemakers, television producers, and professional
photographers to pay more to work in national parks and
federally-owned lands.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, passed by a voice vote authorizes the
secretaries of Interior and Agriculture to set fees for the
commercial use of public land and use the money from those fees to
pay for land management and permit processing costs. It now goes to
the White House for the president's signature.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of the fee would be determined by the number of
people using site and the duration of filming.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate amended the bill in November to ban commercial
land-use that threatens environmental damage, public safety or
impedes the general public from using the park.
</P>
<P>
   ''If permitting filming allows us to recoup its cost and to deal
with some of the other needs of our land management agency then
that is a desired result,'' said bill sponsor Rep. Joel Hefley,
R-Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Hefley said the bill had the support of the Interior Department
and the Motion Picture Association of America, whose president,
Jack Valenti, said it was ''common-sense legislation that benefits
our national parks and all those who visit them.''
</P>
<P>
   Television news, newsreels, and some commercial photography
would be exempt from the fees.
</P>
<P>
   Filmmakers paid to shoot movies in national parks until 1948
when the Interior Department prohibited future collection of
location fees in national parks and wildlife refuges.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Barak Addresses US-Israel Panel  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As Israel's security belt inside southern
Lebanon buckled into chaos Monday, Prime Minister Ehud Barak sought
assurances of a peaceful pullout this summer from the Clinton
administration and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking by satellite to a conference of the most influential
pro-Israel lobby in the United States, Barak said he would hold
Syria and Lebanon accountable if the troop withdrawal was marked by
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Barak squeezed in the speech to the 2,000 members of the
American Israeli Public Affairs Committee amid hurried telephone
consultation with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and senior
Israeli military officers.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, meanwhile, consulted by telephone with U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and leaders of Lebanon, Syria and
Egypt, as well as with Barak, a senior U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
   With the situation along the border with Lebanon growing more
tense by the day, Barak said Albright had assured him the United
States would play a role in the pullout -- one that he did not spell
out -- and that he wanted the U.N. Security Council to endorse the
withdrawal as well.
</P>
<P>
   Albright has expressed support for Barak's decision, but has not
said whether the United States would provide concrete help.
Meanwhile, the administration is other governments to endorse the
pullout and wants it carried out through the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   As Barak spoke, Israeli-allied militiamen, who could be treated
harshly for helping Israel to maintain the security zone for 22
years, fled in panic toward Israel's border. Hundreds of Lebanese
civilians rushed forward to fill the vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   Syria, which wields effective control over Lebanon, wants any
Israeli pullout accompanied by surrender of the Golan Heights, the
strategic plateau it lost in the 1967 Mideast war. But unable to
come to terms with Syria, Barak intends to get Israeli troops out
of Lebanon rather than take more casualties at the hands of
militant guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are determined to pull out in the near future,'' Barak
said. ''I would not recommend to anyone to try us once we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the pullout has already begun in bits and pieces.
Barak may be positioning himself to complete it before a
self-imposed July 7 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, his warning to Lebanon and Syria was unqualified.
''We hold the Lebanese and Syrian governments responsible to make
sure it will be quiet,'' the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak told American Israeli Public Affairs Committee members
that a quarter-million Israelis in northern villages were compelled
to take refuge in shelters from cross-border attacks. ''They may
have to stay there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said confidently, ''We will prevail and we will pull out
of Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak had been scheduled to attend the conference and probably
to meet with President Clinton at the White House, but the violence
in southern Lebanon and on the West Bank caused him to cancel the
trip.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the tensions, U.S. mediator Dennis B. Ross assured the
pro-Israel group that Israel and the Arabs ''have come a long way''
toward peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no question there is a promise of success,'' Ross
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the American official, who shuttled between Washington and
the Middle East for talks with Israel and Palestinian leaders and
also participated in secret negotiations in Stockholm, Sweden, said
agreements cannot be reached with violence.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Asks U.S. Help With AIDS  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton met Monday with South
African President Thabo Mbeki to pursue ways to help South Africa
end its long-running fight with drug companies over producing
cheaper, generic AIDS treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Mbeki arrived at the White House, Clinton said he
was sympathetic to Mbeki's goal of getting cheaper AIDS drugs. He
said he was encouraged to learn that five companies offered last
week to lower their prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got to get them to him. He's got to be able to afford
them,'' Clinton said. ''You've got these five big pharmaceutical
companies now that say they're going to help. The next couple
months we'll see if we really can get a victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Clinton signed an executive order designed
to make cheaper drugs more available in Africa. He said South
Africa's AIDS burdens could be eased if Congress passes his
proposal to offer tax incentives for developing AIDS vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   Besides AIDS, the two leaders discussed trade, renewed war in
the Horn of Africa, unrest in Sierra Leone, Congo and Zimbabwe, and
poverty in general throughout the continent.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are hard challenges without easy answers, and they will
test our partnership,'' Clinton said. ''But that is what partners
are for, to solve big problems together.''
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki praised Clinton for prodding other nations to take a
greater interest in fighting the problems that plague Africa -- such
as disease, famine and war.
</P>
<P>
   ''You and your administration have treated us with dignity,
whatever our differences on specific matters, with sensitivity to
our problems in an unwavering commitment to help us resolve
these,'' Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that it cannot afford AIDS drugs at current prices,
South Africa has been embroiled in a protracted fight with
pharmaceutical companies over importing generic versions of drugs
for which the companies have patents. Mbeki's government was
lukewarm to the companies' offer of cut-rate drugs, saying it could
not accept if it also had to give up the right to seek cheaper
generics.
</P>
<P>
   Going into his meeting with Clinton, Mbeki defended his
positions on fighting AIDS, which infects one in 10 South Africans.
South Africa has contacts with scientists who argue that AZT, a
common treatment, does not work and the human immunodeficiency
virus does not cause AIDS. And earlier this year, Mbeki refused to
allow AZT for pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki flatly denied saying AZT is ineffective. ''I never said
that. Pure invention. Pure invention,'' he said. ''There's a lot of
stuff that's been written which is not true.''
</P>
<P>
   He explained that he feels AZT is a difficulty for his country
because it lacks the appropriate medical infrastructure to
supervise patients. As for the drug companies' offer, Mbeki said
his country is working with the United Nations and the World Health
Organization to ''see how to respond to that.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House seemed satisfied with Mbeki's explanation that
he was misquoted. ''The important thing is the president has said
that President Mbeki understands the scope of the (AIDS) problem,''
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Clinton administration official, who spoke to reporters
on condition of anonymity, said the United States recognizes that
South Africa cannot afford anything like the estimated $2.2 billion
it would cost to administer universal AZT treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki became president last June, succeeding Nelson Mandela, who
met privately with Clinton last week. During Mbeki's tenure, South
Africa has been beset by labor unrest and a falling currency.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in a toast with Vice President Al Gore at the State
Department, Mbeki thanked the United States for its help of a
continent ''that has been marginalized.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore praised Mbeki's vision for Africa. ''You stand at the
forefront of leaders who understand that democracy is about more
than holding elections,'' Gore said.

<HEADLINE> Brewers 10, Astros 9, 10 Innings  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- The Milwaukee Brewers overcame a seven-run
deficit in the ninth inning, then beat the Houston Astros 10-9 in
the opener of Monday's doubleheader when Jose Hernandez homered in
the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   Down 9-2 entering the bottom of the ninth, Milwaukee scored
seven runs against Doug Jones, Jose Cabrera and Billy Wagner, who
blew his fourth save chance of the year. Houston lost its sixth
straight.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, who hit his third homer in three days, also had a
two-run double in the ninth inning, while Jeromy Burnitz's two-run
single with two outs tied the game. The comeback came in a nearly
empty County Stadium, where a few thousand fans saw the Brewers'
biggest comeback in any inning since September 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez hit a one-out pitch from Joe Slusarski (0-2) into the
left-field bleachers. David Weathers (3-1) pitched the 10th as
Milwaukee won for the fourth time in five games.
</P>
<P>
   The ninth began with a walk to Burnitz. Lyle Mouton had a
run-scoring double, followed by a two-run double off Jones by
Hernandez. Marquis Grissom singled in a run against Cabrera,
cutting the lead to 9-6.
</P>
<P>
   After Wagner entered the game, he walked Raul Casanova before
striking out James Mouton and Ron Belliard. But Mark Loretta
singled to drive in Hernandez, and Burnitz's two-run single tied
the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' bullpen collapse wasted seven strong innings from
Shane Reynolds, who gave up a two-run double by Lyle Mouton in the
first inning but didn't allow another runner to reach third while
giving up six hits with four strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams originally were scheduled for a day off Monday, but
the Astros made a 24-hour stopover on their way home from Montreal
following a pair of rainouts against the Brewers last week.
</P>
<P>
   Houston scored three runs in the eighth and two in the ninth to
build its lead. The Astros got run-scoring singles in the eighth by
Tony Eusebio and Biggio, while Bill Spiers had a two-run double in
the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hidalgo's three-run homer in the third inning scored
Craig Biggio and Jeff Bagwell. It came off Steve Woodard, who in
his previous start stopped his 16-game winless streak. Woodard
hasn't won at County Stadium since July 16.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Reynolds didn't get a decision last Tuesday when the
Brewers beat the Astros in 16 innings. ... Bagwell had two doubles.
... Woodard was scheduled to start one of the games against Houston
that was rained out last week. He hadn't started a game since May
11, though he struck out one batter in a relief appearance at
Pittsburgh on May 14. ... Houston was trying to become the second
team in as many days to snap a lengthy road winless streak at
County Stadium. On Sunday, San Francisco beat Milwaukee 16-10 to
end an eight-game skid.

<HEADLINE> Silver's leadership assailed by other Democrats  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The speaker of New York state Assembly faced
an extraordinary public attack against his leadership Monday from
fellow Democrats on the floor of the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Though dissidents led by former majority leader Michael Bragman
did not have nearly the 50 votes needed to overthrow Speaker
Sheldon Silver among the 98 Assembly Democrats, his resolution
challenging Silver as speaker gave him and his allies an opening to
vent about how the Assembly is run.
</P>
<P>
   In a dramatic 15-minute address before a jammed and tense
Assembly chamber, Bragman accused Silver of letting lobbyists and
non-elected staff members control legislation instead of lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has been listening for years to members complain
about how hard it is to even see Silver face-to-face.
</P>
<P>
   He contended the conference committees by which small portions
of the last three state budgets were negotiated have been shams
controlled by legislative leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman even said, ''It is wrong to treat the members from the
minority side with such disrespect.'' Republicans in the Assembly --
like Democrats in the Republican-dominated state Senate -- have
essentially no input on legislation and usually cannot even ''sign
on'' to Democratic bills as sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman, stripped of his majority leader's job and perks when he
went public last week with his challenge against Silver, received a
standing ovation from the 51 Republicans in the Assembly and from
his Democratic allies while the other Democrats sat silent.
</P>
<P>
   Several Silver allies fired back.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Richard Brodsky of Westchester County said the
resolution before the Assembly Monday ''isn't the vehicle'' and
Bragman ''isn't the man'' to correct the complaints being voiced
against Silver.
</P>
<P>
   ''The notion that unreturned phone calls or inappropriate staff
acts -- which will happen, under anyone -- are grounds for
impeachment, is ludicrous,'' Brodsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Clarence Norman, the Brooklyn Democratic leader and
the deputy majority leader, said the Bragman forces ''failed
miserably'' to meet their burden of proving why Silver should not
remain speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ''I say you change leadership when institutions are paralyzed
with corruption or blatant incompetency,'' said Norman, rumored to
be one of Bragman's possible successors, ''and certainly no one can
say our Speaker Sheldon Silver is incompetent or corrupt.''
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo Assemblyman Arthur Eve, a Silver backer who was first
elected in 1966, urged the dissidents to back down and work with
Silver to resolve their problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't destroy this institution,'' he pleaded. ''This
Democratic majority of 1998 are the people's representatives. We
have provided the leadership of all the people of this state. I
feel we are being jeopardized today more than we have ever been all
the years I have been here.''
</P>
<P>
   A Bragman ally, Martin Luster of Tompkins County, was one of two
insurgents so far to be penalized by Silver. Both he and Ronald
Tocci of Westchester County lost their committee chairmanships and
$12,500-a-year stipends for joining Bragman's team.
</P>
<P>
   Luster said he is a ''big boy'' and understands there are
penalties to pay for being on the wrong side of a coup against a
political leader.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I am not willing to accept the notion that with our vote
today that this house is in good order, that we run it as a
democratic institution,'' Luster said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bragman before him, Luster said he was at ease because he
feels he can speak his mind about how the Assembly is run.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have never felt as liberated as I do as this moment,''
Luster said. ''I have never felt so sure of myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Bragman, from suburban Syracuse, and the Manhattanite Silver had
maintained an uneasy alliance in the Assembly since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   At one point last week, Bragman said he had 53 ''rock-solid''
Democrats in the Assembly behind him as speaker. But that began to
erode as Silver and his allies lobbied back.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman said Silver threatened to run many members with
Democratic primary opponents this year or to redistrict them out of
office in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday morning, he stood at a news conference with 19 other
Democrats, the remnant of his ''rock-solid'' 53.
</P>
<P>
   ''I cannot be angry because I know what you went through,''
Bragman told his Democratic colleagues Monday. ''I think you for
hanging on as long as you could.''
</P>
<P>
   The remaining dissidents said they had formed a Democratic
Majority Reform Caucus to act as a permanent agent for change in
the Assembly.

<HEADLINE> Promise Seen for Spinal Injuries  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL RECER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A nerve tissue that is usually damaged in
spinal injuries was restored in laboratory animals using embryonic
stem cells -- a study that may eventually lead to a new treatment
for people paralyzed by injury or disease.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the Washington University in St. Louis School of
Medicine showed in mouse and rat studies that embryonic stem cells
can be used in adult animals to regrow tissue, called myelin, that
covers and insulates nerve fibers.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John W. McDonald, lead author of the study, said that the
loss of function from spinal injury and disease is often because of
damaged or eroded myelin. When this insulating tissue is gone,
axons, or nerve fibers, stop sending signals to the brain.
</P>
<P>
   ''Demyelination is a central feature of most central nervous
system injuries,'' said McDonald. ''Regaining myelination can offer
substantial improvement in function.''
</P>
<P>
   A report on the study appears Tuesday in the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   In their study, Washington University researchers used embryonic
stem cells from mice to regrow myelin tissue in the spinal cords of
rats.
</P>
<P>
   Embryonic stem cells, or ES cells, are master cells formed early
in development. The cells can transform into any type of cell in
the body.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers used chemicals to cause the mouse ES cells to turn
into a culture containing the precursors of neurons, astrocytes and
oligodendrocytes -- the key cells in the nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald said that his group found that in rats with injured
spines injections of these cultures caused oligodendrocytes to move
to the injury site and to tightly cover the exposed nerve fibers
with new myelin.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the first demonstration that oligodendrocytes from
embryonic stem cells can remyelinate the injured adult nervous
system,'' said McDonald. This is significant, he noted, because
injuries and disease that cause the loss of myelin occur most
frequently in adults.
</P>
<P>
   The next step, said McDonald, is to test if growing new myelin
will allow animals with spinal injuries to regain the functions,
such as bladder control or leg movement, that was lost to the
injury.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald said that his lab was ready to test this technique in
humans, but that current regulations prevent labs receiving federal
research funds from using human embryonic stem cells in research.
</P>
<P>
   ''Essentially we are blocked from working with human embryonic
stem cells,'' he said. ''This has been a big hold up.''
</P>
<P>
   Using human embryonic stem cells in research is controversial
because the cells must originate from a human embryo or fetus that
is aborted. The National Institutes of Health last year published
proposed guidelines that would permit some federally funded
research with human ES cells, but the final guidelines are still
under review, an NIH spokesman said. Some members of Congress have
said they would oppose the use of human ES cells in research.

<HEADLINE> Miller on Knicks: 'I Hate Them'  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- ''I hate them.''
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Miller didn't hide his feelings Monday as he spoke about
the New York Knicks and the Eastern Conference's other great
rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers' guard stayed away from the ''I respect them'' line
that had cushioned his remarks a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ''They always think they're bigger and badder than everyone,''
Miller said. ''And we know they don't give us any respect. So why
should I give respect or like someone that doesn't give us
respect?''
</P>
<P>
   This will be Chapter 6 of Knicks-Pacers in the postseason, a
rivalry that has produced some of the most dramatic NBA theater of
the past decade. The star of the show has often been the skinny,
outspoken sharpshooter who so relishes playing the villain.
</P>
<P>
   Miller has had some of the best performances of his career
against the Knicks, most of them coming at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   He scored 25 points in the fourth quarter of Game 5 in 1994,
eight points in 11.2 seconds to win Game 1 in 1995, and made a
3-pointer from in front of Spike Lee 's courtside seat to force
overtime in Game 4 in 1998 and spark Indiana to a series-turning
victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers watched Game 7 of the Miami-New York series together
Sunday afternoon, then held a practice in the evening. They held
another practice Monday while the Knicks returned to New York from
Miami and prepared to fly to Indianapolis later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   ''Personally, I wanted to play New York, somewhat exorcise some
demons,'' said Miller, who has been playing some of the best
playoff basketball of his career during this postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have beaten New York, but it's never been in a conference
final. Detroit had to get by Boston, Chicago had to get past
Detroit. So there's always that team you've got to get by to get to
the next level, and New York is that team for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Indiana and New York met in the conference finals in 1994 and
1999, the Knicks winning both times. The Pacers won second-round
matchups in 1995 and 1998, and the Knicks beat Indiana in the first
round in 1993, when their playoff rivalry began.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers and Knicks went after each other extra hard in the
regular season, showing flashes of lingering animosity that has
disappeared from the Knicks-Heat rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   New York forward Kurt Thomas threw a punch at Jalen Rose during
a Christmas Day game, and Miller grabbed his crotch and mouthed
obscenities at fans in New York at a game Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ''You never like losing, but I hate losing to them,'' Miller
said.
</P>
<P>
   The teams split the season series 2-2, each winning twice at
home. The Pacers will have homecourt advantage in this series, with
Games 1 and 2 at Conseco Fieldhouse on Tuesday and Thursday before
the series shifts to New York for Games 3 and 4 Saturday and
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy wasn't playing into the rivalry hype
Monday, instead saving his most critical comments for the way Miami
complained about the officiating after it lost Game 7 on Sunday in
the conference semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ''It irritates me and it's disappointing that it's hard for
teams to give credit when they lose. It's always some external
force,'' Van Gundy said. ''If we had lost, I would hope my players
would have handled themselves differently.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers have done their share of complaining, too, tossing
out small market vs. big market conspiracy theories after the
referees failed to call offensive goaltending on Patrick Ewing when
he redirected Larry Johnson's 3-pointer into the basket near the
end of a Pacers-Knicks game in April.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, the Knicks weren't at all happy with the
referees in late March when the Pacers went to the free-throw line
14 times to New York's none during the fourth quarter of a game at
Indiana on March 22.
</P>
<P>
   New York defeated Indiana 4-2 in last year's Eastern Conference
finals despite playing the final four games without Ewing and the
second half of Game 6 without Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Latrell Sprewell moved into the starting lineup for the Knicks
during that series and has been there ever since, while Indiana's
small forward, Jalen Rose, had to wait until this season to replace
Chris Mullin in the starting five.
</P>
<P>
   The other big difference this year is the absence of the traded
Antonio Davis, who gave the Pacers a big body off the bench to
match up with New York's front line. Austin Croshere, more of a
shooter than a banger, has taken Davis' spot as the first forward
off the bench for the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   Pacers coach Larry Bird spoke Monday about the need for his team
to take the next big step and get to the finals. Indiana has been
eliminated in the conference finals in four of the past six
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   When Bird was asked if he hates the Knicks, the former Boston
Celtics great said it was hard for him to get angry with a team
''when I have more championship rings than they do.''
</P>
<P>
   No player on either team matches Miller's strong feelings about
the rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   As he sat with the media Monday morning wearing a floppy hat,
sunglasses and sandals, he made it clear how excited he was to have
another shot at the Knicks. As for his feelings, it was pointed out
that ''hate'' is a strong word.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a very strong word,'' Miller said, not backing down.
</P>
<P>
   Strong word, strong rivalry.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Rages in Lebanon  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE COPANS
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel (AP) -- Fearful that an outbreak of
fighting in south Lebanon would spill over into reprisal attacks,
tens of thousands of northern Israelis hastily gathered up
children, food and schoolbooks as the army ordered them into
underground bomb shelters Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The rapidly deteriorating situation in south Lebanon -- including
concern that Israel's allied militia could be lurching toward
collapse -- brought calls from some to hasten Israel's troop pullout
from the zone in south Lebanon where it has had a military presence
for the past 22 years.
</P>
<P>
   Haim Ramon, a Cabinet minister and confident of Prime Minister
Ehud Barak, said at a late-night meeting of Israel's security
Cabinet that he hoped the pullout would be ''much earlier'' than
Israel's self-imposed July 7 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon also told Israel's Channel 2 that once the troops are out
of Lebanon, Israel will feel far less constrained in terms of
reprisals if it is attacked.
</P>
<P>
   ''Up until now ... we could not react as we are capable of
doing, using the full power of the (army),'' he said. ''The rules
of the game are changing.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel beefed up defenses on its northern border -- army tank
transporters were seen Monday night on the road leading north -- and
warned that attacks on either its troops or its northern
communities would bring harsh reprisals, not limited to the battle
zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ''If someone initiates attacks on Israeli soldiers, not to
mention the settlements of the north, as we withdraw ... the
response will be very painful,'' said Barak, speaking in the border
town of Zarit. ''I don't recommend to anyone in the area to provoke
a response from Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kiryat Shemona, the principal border town, loudspeakers
blared orders to head into shelters after word came that two
Lebanese civilians had been killed in the occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
   In a crowded market, people grabbed their groceries and hurried
off. Even youngsters like 12-year-old Efrat Ohana knew enough to
take cover quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was on the way home from school, and as my mother taught me,
I ran with my bag to the shelter in the building and waited for my
parents to come home from work,'' she said calmly.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic heading south was heavy as some northerners opted to
flee out of rocket range rather than spend a night in shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Barak repeated Monday that Israel's troop pullout would be
completed by its self-imposed deadline of July 7, but said the
exact date will be decided ''according to ... Israel's
considerations.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those considerations is the state of Israel's allied
militia, the South Lebanon Army, elements of which appear to be
sliding into a state of chaos. Over the past few days, SLA
militiamen have been abandoning outposts, deserting by the dozens
and seeking shelter in Israel, apparently fearing for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   With the pullback of the SLA, sympathizers of the Shiite Muslim
Hezbollah guerrillas have in the past two days taken over a dozen
villages, giving the guerrillas a foothold close by the Israeli
border.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, five SLA men -- all senior officers, according to
Israel radio -- crossed over into Israel near the communal farm of
Milkhia to plead for asylum for themselves and dozens of relatives.
Israel has promised to provide shelter to fleeing militiamen and
their families.
</P>
<P>
   SLA men remaining in Lebanon after the pullout face the threat
of reprisals from Hezbollah, which led the fight to drive out
Israel, and from the Lebanese government, which considers the SLA
troops traitors and has sentenced some officers to death in
absentia.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli daily Maariv, in Monday's editions, said senior
Israeli military officers had ''great doubt'' as to whether the SLA
could continue to function.
</P>
<P>
   So rife was speculation about a speeded-up withdrawal timetable
that the Defense Ministry issued a statement explicitly denying
there was any order to pull out on June 1.
</P>
<P>
   Worry is growing about SLA-abandoned weaponry falling into the
hands of Hezbollah. On Monday, Israeli warplanes destroyed an SLA
artillery battery in the central area of the occupied zone after it
was abandoned by its crew, the army said.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials said it had been known all along that a
unilateral pullout from south Lebanon -- without any guarantees from
Lebanon that it would prevent guerrilla attacks -- might not go
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   Asked on Israel TV whether the situation had spun out of
control, Israel's justice minister, Yossi Beilin, said: ''Anyone
who spoke about withdrawal without an agreement understood it would
be a withdrawal without rice being thrown at soldiers, and would
not be simple.''

<HEADLINE> Bonior Takes On Clinton Over China  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- On the day Bill Clinton welcomed former
presidents and Cabinet officers to the White House to endorse China
trade legislation, Rep. David Bonior appeared with an actress,
Goldie Hawn, in the Capitol to argue the opposing side.
</P>
<P>
   And on the morning after a key committee gave unexpectedly
lopsided approval to the bill, the Michigan Democrat stood outside
with Chinese dissidents, just as he stood with union workers,
environmentalists, veterans and other opponents on other days.
</P>
<P>
   He may be outvoted in the end by a powerful lobbying effort by
the White House and business, as some lawmakers on both sides of
the issue predict. But Bonior, the No. 2 Democrat in the House with
close ties to organized labor, remains undeterred in his role as
point man for the opposition on a measure that would make trading
rules with China permanent.
</P>
<P>
   ''I care deeply about labor rights and the environment. I've
built my whole career around these principles, and human rights,''
he said in an interview in his office on the third floor of the
Capitol. ''... If they can be peeled back, eroded through trade
agreements, then I see a betrayal of the values of the people that
went before me.''
</P>
<P>
   By that, he says, he means his grandmother, ''who marched as a
suffragette to give women the right to vote,'' and his grandfather
''in the sit-down strikes at the (auto) plants'' in the 1930s fight
for labor rights.
</P>
<P>
   Bonior, 54, won election to Congress from an area around those
auto plants in 1976, after service in the Air Force, experience as
an adoption caseworker and probation officer and four years in the
Michigan Legislature. His voting record is reliably liberal on
economic and many social issues. A Catholic, he opposes abortion
rights, unusual for a man who has risen so high in national
Democratic politics.
</P>
<P>
   Since Republicans gained a majority in the 1994 elections,
Bonior has been a fierce critic of GOP economic policies and former
Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Opposing trade legislation is nothing new for him. He fought the
North American Free Trade Agreement that passed Congress in 1993,
arguing it would export American jobs to Mexico, where labor and
environmental protections were, in his view, inadequate. And he
voted against Chinese trade privileges in a series of annual votes
in recent years on numerous grounds, including human rights.
</P>
<P>
   The current China measure, which comes to a vote this week,
would end such yearly votes and give China so-called normalized
trading rules permanently. Bonior says that would end any chance of
influencing Chinese policy.
</P>
<P>
   This time there's a difference in the political equation.
</P>
<P>
   As was the case with NAFTA, the House Democratic leader, Rep.
Richard Gephardt of Missouri, opposes the China bill. But Democrats
say he is now more focused on his party's efforts to win the House
this fall, and working to prevent any serious splits in a caucus
divided over the trade measure.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, he avoids public events that Bonior's office arranges --
the very appearances that are a routine part of Gephardt's effort
to promote Democratic legislation such as a minimum wage increase.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't drop everything else that I do here to work on one
issue,'' Gephardt told reporters recently. ''I have a wide-ranging
job that encompasses a lot of issues and a lot of activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonior, too, recognizes potential political fallout from a vote
on which organized labor has invested so much. Passage of the North
American Free Trade Agreement helped contribute to a falloff in
votes in the 1994 election that cost Democrats their majority.
</P>
<P>
   But, he adds, ''It's not clear yet whether this will have the
same impact that NAFTA did'' if it passes.
</P>
<P>
   Allies and opponents alike credit Bonior's work.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's representing a majority of the Democratic caucus and his
constituency (in Michigan). That's his job,'' said Rep. Jim Moran,
a Virginia Democrat who supports the China trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bonior's the only one (among top Democrats) who's being
straight on this,'' says Rep. Tom Davis, a member of the GOP
leadership who accuses Gephardt of ''gaming'' the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''Like him or not, he's effective,'' added Davis, the head of
the GOP campaign committee, which tried but failed to field a
candidate capable of mounting a strong challenge to Bonior in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Davis and most House Republicans are expected to vote for the
trade bill, along with as many as a third of all Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But Bonior, soft-spoken in his office, says they have it wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have the policy of the past masquerading as the future,''
he said. ''That's not good enough because what's at stake here is
the standard of living, the quality of air and water and all of the
other important human rights issues we've been raising.
</P>
<P>
   ''So this is kind of central to why I got involved in government
in the first place.''

<HEADLINE> 3 Iran Jews Enter Innocent Spy Plea  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHIRAZ, Iran (AP) -- Many of their co-defendants have admitted
guilt, but three of 13 Iranian Jews accused of spying for Israel
said Monday they will plead innocent to the charges.
</P>
<P>
   The three men spoke to reporters before their hearing began in
the southern Iranian city of Shiraz. They said they had not hired
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't need lawyers. We are not spies. We are innocent and
we will be acquitted, God willing,'' shoe merchant Omid Tefilin
said.
</P>
<P>
   He and his co-defendants at Monday's hearing, student Navid
Balazadeh and shopkeeper Nejatollah Brukhimnejad, have been free on
bail since February, apparently because the charges against them
are less serious than those against the other 10 defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The other 10 are in custody. Of those, eight have pleaded
guilty, while one, Farzad Kashi, has denied the charges. The tenth
said he collected information for Israel, but it did not amount to
espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has denied that any of the defendants were its spies.
</P>
<P>
   The trial has generated international concern, and the defense
has questioned the fairness of the closed-door revolutionary court
where the judge is also the prosecutor and there is no jury. The
trial is closed to the public because it involves issues of
national security.
</P>
<P>
   The main defendants have been accused of collecting photographs
of military installations for Israel, collecting information for
sabotage operations and studying ways to poison the water supply of
Shiraz. Iranian state television has broadcast the confessions of
two defendants, who said they were trained and paid by Israel to
gather secrets in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers have said they would insist on seeing evidence
that secret information was handed to Israel. They have said the
indictments so far do not carry the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The penalty for espionage here is a long prison term. The death
penalty would apply only to charges of ''moharebeh'' -- fighting
against God and the state. The men have not been charged with that
offense.

<HEADLINE> For high rollers, casino charters have been sure bet  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- From Roanoke, Va., and Buffalo, N.Y.,
from Scranton, Pa., and Montreal, Quebec, they come -- in hopes of
striking it rich.
</P>
<P>
   In twin-engine commuters and big-body 737s, more than 1,000 high
rollers a day fly in or out of Atlantic City International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   For casinos, the charter flights offer a quick way to bring
their most prized customers to this seaside resort, which is home
to 12 casinos and more than 35,540 slot machines and 1,330
blackjack tables, baccarat pits and poker parlors.
</P>
<P>
   For the affluent gamblers, the planes offer a quick in and quick
out of a town, where scheduled air service is limited to US Airways
commuter planes and Spirit Airlines jets bound for Sun Belt cities.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 percent of the 1 million people who fly into the
airport annually do so on casino charters. The flights are
generally paid for by casinos, which bank on the customers to lose
enough money at the tables to compensate the casino for the
aviation expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're big business,'' said airport spokesman Peter Hartt.
</P>
<P>
   It was a casino charter, carrying 17 casino junket passengers
who had spent the day at Caesars Atlantic City Hotel Casino, that
crashed near Wilkes-Barre, Pa., on Sunday, killing all 19 aboard.
</P>
<P>
   The twin-engine turboprop belonged to Executive Airlines, a
Farmingdale, N.Y.-based charter service that has been flying
gamblers here for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   One of 66 such companies that do business with casinos,
Executive Airlines flies about one charter a day from the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of the people who come into Atlantic City come in to go
gambling. It's not a business market; it's a leisure market,'' said
Robert Moreland, vice president of safety for Spirit Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Wolk, a Philadelphia lawyer who works only on air crash
cases, said Monday that charter travel is typically riskier than
airline travel.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without saying either was a factor here, people have to
understand: A charter operator is simply not operating at the level
of safety or under the same regulation as an airline is.
</P>
<P>
   ''The typical charter operator will have pilots who are younger,
building time to further their hopeful airline careers. The
airplanes are typically older, too. So what happens is that unless
there's an independent safety audit of the operator by the casino,
there is literally nothing the passenger has to go by to decide
whether or not that's an operator you'd want to fly with,'' said
Wolk, a licensed jet pilot.
</P>
<P>
   News of the crash had a chilling effect.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not good to read something like this in the newspaper,''
said Katrin Sussman, a flight attendant on a charter flying out of
the airport Monday. ''Always, when you read something like this,
you think about it and realize it's the same thing you're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   But others were unfazed. ''Walking across the street is a
gamble. You can get killed doing that, too,'' said Rick Perrin, 55,
of Toronto, who was waiting at the airport Monday to board a
charter home.
</P>
<P>
   Other passengers on his flight echoed his comments.
</P>
<P>
   ''Life is a game. We take it as it comes,'' said a man who
declined to give his name.
</P>
<P>
   According to Federal Aviation Administration records, Executive
Airlines, or its parent company East Coast Airways, has had 10
incidents reported to the FAA since 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Two were fatal:
</P>
<P>
   --In May 1986, two people died and another was injured when a
company Cessna hit an automobile after overshooting the runway at
Bader Field, a small general aviation airport owned by the city of
Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   --In October 1995, one person died and five were injured when the
engine of a Piper aircraft returning gamblers from Caesars seized
on descent to JFK Airport and fell into the ocean near Rockaway,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   One of the survivors, Bharat Jotwani, 45, of Dix Hills, N.Y.,
lost $10,300 in cash he had won gambling. ''I don't care about the
money,'' he said at the time. ''When you survive and are alive,
that is the biggest win you can ever have.''
</P>
<P>
   Gamblers aren't the only ones who have died flying in or out of
Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1989, three Trump Hotels executives were killed when
a helicopter taking them to Atlantic City crashed on a Garden State
Parkway median. Two crew members died also.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Argues Over Peacekeeper Funds  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department said Monday that a
congressional hold on $226 million for U.N. peacekeeping activities
is damaging U.N. efforts to achieve peace and stability in Sierra
Leone, Kosovo, East Timor and the Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan said a continued
hold on the money ''is going to hamper our activities.''
</P>
<P>
   The funds are being blocked by Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., who
oversees State Department spending.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg has said he would keep the money on hold at least until
the situation in Sierra Leone had changed.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg is angry about the Clinton administration's role in
encouraging a peace agreement in that African country, signed in
July, which gave amnesty and a share of power to rebel leader Foday
Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said both the United
Nations and the United States are being adversely affected by the
hold.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have $226 million in unpaid bills, despite having the funds
already appropriated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Annan, speaking with reporters in New York, said, ''I hope that
the other members of the Senate would work with the senator
concerned to remove the holds.''
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of a key Senate Appropriations subcommittee, Gregg
has the authority to put a hold on foreign assistance outlays
singlehandedly.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg has frozen $368 million, which is the estimated U.S. share
of peacekeeping costs for Sierra Leone, Kosovo East Timor and Congo
for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30. The $226 million mentioned by
Boucher represents unpaid bills to date for these operations.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said that as a result of the hold, ''the United Nations
either has to defer payments to nations that are providing
peacekeepers or skimp in some other area. Either way, it damages
U.N. peacekeeping.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration seems to have hardened its position on Sankoh
in recent days, especially since he was detained by pro-government
troops in the Sierra Leonean capital of Freetown late last week.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, Boucher said Sankoh has a ''chance to play a
positive role'' in resurrecting the peace agreement that he signed
almost a year ago and then violated.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Boucher said, ''We believe in both peace and justice.
And if you're going to have justice, there needs to be
accountability.
</P>
<P>
   ''Second of all, any crimes that have been committed by the
Revolutionary United Front since the Lome peace agreement was
signed are not covered by the domestic amnesty that was part of
that agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it is up to the Sierra Leonean government to decide
whether to prosecute Sankoh for any crimes he may have committed
during long years of war that had catastrophic humanitarian
consequences for the country's civilian population.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda, Uganda Set Congo Pullout  </HEADLINE>
By HRVOJE HRANJSKI
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) -- Rwandan and Ugandan army commanders agreed
to start withdrawing troops and heavy weapons this week from the
northern Congo city of Kisangani, which they will turn over to U.N.
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   At a late-night meeting Sunday, Ugandan army chief Maj. Gen.
Jeje Odongo and Rwandan army chief-of-staff Brig. Gen. Kayumba
Nyamwasa signed an agreement to begin a 16-day withdrawal on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   According to the agreement, the two armies will withdraw to at
least 60 miles from Kisangani, each leaving behind 216 soldiers to
jointly patrol until 1,000 U.N. observers and troops take charge.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda and Uganda -- nominal allies in a 1{-year war against
Congolese President Laurent Kabila -- failed to resolve whether the
Rwandan-backed Congolese rebels should also withdraw from the city.
The rebels have objected to leaving, arguing that only foreigners
should withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very sincere about what we've discussed,'' Odongo told
reporters, but he added that the rebels' presence in Kisangani was
''essential'' for the success of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda and Uganda support rival rebel groups in Congo. The two
countries poured troops and arms into supporting the rebels, after
accusing Kabila training their enemies -- Rwandan Hutu militiamen,
who carried out the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, and Sudan-backed
Ugandan rebels.
</P>
<P>
   But quarrels among army officers and differences over war
conduct led the Ugandan and Rwandan troops to fight each other in
Kisangani, first in August and again this month when the Ugandans
tried to add troops from northern Congo and expel Rwandans from the
city, Rwandan army and U.N. military observers said.
</P>
<P>
   A team of U.N. military observers witnessed the signing of
Monday's agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has promised to send 5,537 U.N. observers and
troops to four locations in Congo, including Kisangani, to
strengthen a fragile cease-fire and oversee the withdrawal of
foreign troops and disarming of militias.
</P>
<P>
   The deployment, which is not expected before July, is part of a
peace agreement signed in August by Kabila and the rebels. Rwanda
and Uganda also signed, as did Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia, which
back Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations who
helped draft the plan to demilitarize Kisangani, said this week
that the Kisangani deployment should be given priority to keep
fighting from flaring up again.

<HEADLINE> Brewers Sends Estrada To Triple-A  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- The Milwaukee Brewers sent left-handed pitcher
Horacio Estrada back to Triple-A Indianapolis on Monday and
recalled left-hander Rafael Roque.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada started three games for the Brewers and made two relief
appearances. He was 2-0 with an 8.04 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Estrada appeared in relief and finally stopped the
San Francisco Giants' 11-run sixth inning before getting his first
major league hit an inning later.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada lost his rotation spot with the returns of injured
starters Jeff D'Amico, John Snyder and Jamey Wright, all of whom
will be in the Brewers' rotation by Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Roque, the Brewers' opening-day starter in 1999, is back in
Milwaukee's bullpen for the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers will need to make another roster move on Tuesday to
clear a spot for Wright, who is scheduled to make his Milwaukee
debut that day against the Atlanta Braves.

<HEADLINE> Investigators looking at whether bad fuel was a factor in plane crash </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER NEWTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) -- Investigators on Monday were looking
into whether contaminated fuel caused both engines to fail aboard a
charter plane before the aircraft crashed, killing all 19 people
aboard. But the probe was hampered because the cockpit voice
recorder was not working at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board investigators searched
for clues in the wreckage after Sunday's crash of the Executive
Airlines twin-engine turboprop, which was carrying 17 passengers
home from a gambling trip to Atlantic City, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The two pilots, who also were killed, had reported to air
traffic controllers that they lost both engines as they made their
second approach to the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton airport in the rain.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation analysts said dual-engine failures are rare and can
indicate a problem with the fuel supply.
</P>
<P>
   NTSB member George Black said investigators were ''looking at
fuel and fuel systems,'' including whether the fuel was
contaminated.
</P>
<P>
   However, Black said later that no evidence of contamination was
found in a preliminary test of the fuel from a truck in
Farmingdale, N.Y., that had refueled the plane. The tests were
continuing and would include a ground sample from the crash site.
</P>
<P>
   Black also said the voice recorder had an improper power supply
and did not record any sounds in the cockpit. Plus, the plane did
not have the other type of ''black box'' recorder, the one that
takes down flight data such as speed and altitude, because it was
not required for the model of airplane, a Jetstream 31.
</P>
<P>
   ''This seriously hampers the investigation,'' Black said. ''This
is somewhat disappointing, and we're going to do the best we can
without it.''
</P>
<P>
   The plane left Farmingdale on Sunday morning, picked up the
passengers about 10:30 a.m. in Atlantic City and then headed to
Wilkes-Barre for the one-hour, 150-mile flight.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Hartt, spokesman for the South Jersey Transportation
Authority, which operates the Atlantic City Airport, said the
aircraft received no fuel or repairs there. The director of the
airport in Farmingdale, Hugh Jones, referred all questions about
the plane to the NTSB.
</P>
<P>
   John Nance, an aviation analyst in Tacoma, Wash., said one
failed engine is a ''very rare event.''
</P>
<P>
   ''To have two fail simultaneously is simply beyond the realm of
probability,'' he said. ''What will cause two engines to stop
running simultaneously is an interruption in the fuel supply. It
could be some sort of catastrophic problem with the pumping system
or the plumbing of the fuel system.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Peragine, chief executive of the Farmingdale-based
Executive Airlines, said the company had never had problems with
the 12-year-old plane. He said the pilot had 8,500 hours of flight
time, ''a relatively high amount of time,'' and the co-pilot was
about to be upgraded to captain.
</P>
<P>
   ''These were two expert pilots and the machine was maintained to
the highest standards,'' Peragine said. ''You just don't have a
clue as to what could have possibly happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The plane went down about nine miles from the
Wilkes-Barre/Scranton airport at 11:48 a.m. Sunday. Black said the
plane might have missed its first approach because of bad weather.
It was raining, and visibility was poor.
</P>
<P>
   As investigators looked for clues, nearby communities mourned
the victims, who had gone to Atlantic City on Saturday afternoon on
the flight chartered by Caesars Atlantic City Hotel Casino.
</P>
<P>
   Debra Maleski lost her mother, Nancy Maleski, 66, of Moosic, and
sister Elaine Pilosi, 46. She said the casino chartered the flight
every other weekend from Wilkes-Barre.
</P>
<P>
   ''They just went for an evening of fun and excitement. They
played the slots,'' Maleski said. ''They didn't like to fly, either
one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents in the small communities near Wilkes-Barre waited for
the coroner to post the list of victims.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you don't know somebody, you know someone who knows them,''
said Jerry Mancinelli of Dallas, Pa. ''Everybody in the valley is
going to be touched.''

<HEADLINE> Stars: Morrow's Ankle Really Broken  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME ARON
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- A broken bone in Brenden Morrow's right ankle was
supposed to knock him out of the playoffs. Instead, the Dallas
Stars' rookie forward missed just two games.
</P>
<P>
   Another case of playoff gamesmanship? Hardly, insists Stars
coach Ken Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there's some people that are a little bit confused
about his injury,'' said Hitchcock, who didn't help matters by
declaring last week that Morrow wasn't likely to return. ''It's a
fracture.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fracture site is definitive, it's really a matter of
swelling and pain. If he's able to play without the ankle swelling
up, then we're in good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock compared the break to the one suffered by center Mike
Modano in last year's Stanley Cup finals. Modano, though, broke a
bone in his wrist and played with a cast.
</P>
<P>
   Morrow taped his ankle and played 13 minutes, 26 seconds in
Dallas' 4-1 victory Sunday. There was minimal swelling overnight
and he walked through the dressing room Monday with only a slight
limp. He's expected to play in Game 5 Tuesday night, although how
long is still in doubt.

<P>
   ''I think we all wondered what it was going to be like today
when I woke up, but it never swelled up too bad,'' said Morrow,
crediting ice and milk for his quick recovery. ''The pain never got
too bad.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Who's to say it was ever broken?'' Modano said, smirking. ''It
depends on who is reading the X-rays. Everyone is day-to-day in the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Morrow said he's seen the crack on the X-ray, but he's not sure
where the damage is. All he knows is that it's not to either of the
major bones on the inside or outside of the ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Morrow was injured after being tangled up with Colorado's Dave
Andreychuk late in Game 1. He missed Games 2 and 3, but felt good
enough to skate Saturday. The problem was, his equipment was in
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Morrow borrowed a pair of Modano's skates, then the team flew in
the rookie's equipment just in case he might be ready to play
Sunday. He was on the ice enough to make four hits and had a plus-2
rating.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some people can't play with that pain, but he feels he can,''
Hitchcock said. ''Whether it gets to the point that it's too
uncomfortable and he can't perform, time will tell.''

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Refugees Flood Sudan  </HEADLINE>
By MOHAMED OSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL-LAFA CAMP, Sudan (AP) -- Weakened by its own civil war and
poverty, Sudan struggled Monday to cope with an influx of refugees
fleeing violence in neighboring Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan -- which for 30 years has been receiving Eritrean refugees
fleeing warfare and drought -- had hoped to begin sending Eritreans
home Tuesday. But intensified fighting between Eritrea and Ethiopia
has prompted a new refugee exodus, forcing Sudan to put its plans
on hold.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, Yalssa Yamani returned to her home in Eritrea
from the Sudanese refugee camp el-Lafa, only to find herself back
this week with her husband and 3-month-old baby.
</P>
<P>
   ''What can we do?'' she said. ''If we go home, which we want to
do, we will get killed. And if we stay here, we will repeat the
story of those who lived here for decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Yamani's family waited four days at el-Lafa -- Sudan's largest
camp -- to register as refugees, which entitles them to a share of
scant resources, food and other aid.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees live out in the open on the semi-desert terrain,
hiding from the scorching sun under strips of cloth hung from
sticks or behind carts they use to carry their belongings. The
Sudanese government had not yet brought tents.
</P>
<P>
   Daytime temperatures topped 100 degrees at the camp, near the
border town of Kassala, about 250 miles east of Khartoum. Local aid
groups provided vaccinations against infectious disease and basic
medical care on Monday, including treatment for dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. World Food Program brought in cooking oil, wheat flour
and beans that was distributed Monday by the state refugee office.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan borders both Eritrea and Ethiopia, two of the poorest
countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
   About 25,000 Eritrean refugees have registered in Kassala, and
the number was expected to rise to 200,000, Kassala Gov. Ibrahim
Mahmoud Hamid said. The Sudanese refugees were among at least
550,000 Eritreans that have been uprooted by the latest fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia invaded Eritrea on May 12, resuming the violence that
has cost the lives of tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians
since first erupting in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopian forces seized the western town of Barentu, 75 miles
east of Kassala. Ethiopia also claimed to have taken territory 60
miles from the Eritrean capital, Asmara.
</P>
<P>
   Hamid said some 70 Eritrean soldiers had crossed into Sudan and
turned in their weapons, ''but we are sure some of those refugees
are actually soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Hamid said his government would do all it could for the
refugees, he acknowledged that some Sudanese would be reluctant to
help.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan has accused Eritrea of supporting Sudanese opposition
groups who have attacked Sudan from inside Eritrea. In March,
southern Sudanese rebels and northern opposition groups based in
Eritrea seized Sudan's Hamashkoraib district near Kassala.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have people who lost loved ones during shelling of our
borders, you have others who lost their limbs as a result of land
mines planted by the opposition coming from inside Eritrea,'' Hamid
said. ''People here are not unlikely to have some hard feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   Sudan's civil war and attendant famines have killed nearly 2
million people since 1983. Sudanese rebels seek autonomy for the
predominantly Christian and animist south from the Muslim-dominated
north.

<HEADLINE> Limbaugh Auditioned For MNF Show  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rush Limbaugh confirmed Monday he auditioned
for ''Monday Night Football,'' and he thinks the result was
''excellent.''
</P>
<P>
   The conservative talk show host said he recently traveled to Los
Angeles and called a prerecorded game with play-by-play host Al
Michaels.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought it was excellent, to tell you the truth,'' Limbaugh
said in an interview with WMAL-AM.
</P>
<P>
   ''I surprised myself. I had not seen the game we did. And I
didn't try to study up on the game, because who knows how the real
game's going to play out, you never know,'' he added. ''So the
thing that I came away with after it was over was how much I really
dug it. It was even more fun than I thought it would be.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Monday Night Football,'' though still one of the most popular
shows on television, has suffered a modest ratings decline in
recent years. Analyst Boomer Esiason was fired in March, and Don
Ohlmeyer, the show's producer in the 1970s, was brought back to
revive the spice the broadcast had in the days of Howard Cosell and
Don Meredith.
</P>
<P>
   Limbaugh has lobbied on his radio show for the chance to
audition. But the thought of the outspoken and often polarizing
personality moving to the broadcast booth has been ridiculed by
some.
</P>
<P>
   Limbaugh said he wouldn't try to be another Cosell, and he began
discussing the lineup of games this season as someone who is ready
to take the job.
</P>
<P>
   ''Look at the Monday night schedule this season,'' Limbaugh
said. ''I hate to say this, but if the Rams or Redskins don't
perform up to potential, the schedule is going to come back to
haunt them. So, I played this out and have been very serious about
it all along, and there have been discussions about whether or not
I can handle this and do a Monday radio show at the same time.
There is no question that I could.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC would not comment on Limbaugh's audition, or even confirm
that it actually took place.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will not comment on any individual,'' spokesman Mark Mandel
said. ''We will wait until we make our formal announcement in early
June.''

<HEADLINE> Sex Stations Cheer Court Ruling  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- For operators of sex-oriented cable TV channels,
the nation's highest court has just unscrambled their business
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Playboy Television, Spice and The Hot Network all cheered the
Supreme Court for striking down a law that forced many cable
operators to restrict sexually-oriented material to late-night
hours.
</P>
<P>
   The law required cable operators to fully block this programming
to nonsubscribers during daylight hours. But since many cable
systems lacked the technology to guarantee that their sound and
pictures would be completely scrambled, they opted to restrict
these networks to airing only between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Since cable systems could effectively air the channels only
eight hours a day, many decided it was more profitable to air
networks with no restrictions, said Tony Lynn, president of the
Playboy Entertainment Group.
</P>
<P>
   ''It put carriage of our network in jeopardy in a number of
places,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Playboy operates four separate adult-oriented stations,
including Playboy Television and Spice. The largest, Playboy TV, is
available in 20 million homes, 13 million with cable and the rest
with satellite dishes, Lynn said. There are roughly 100 million
television homes in the country, 76 million with cable or satellite
dishes.
</P>
<P>
   The law didn't affect what the stations put on the air. However,
Playboy TV had to make certain it had programming that started at
10 p.m. in every time zone so no one was joining something in
progress, Lynn said.
</P>
<P>
   About 26 million homes -- 10 million of them cable -- get The Hot
Network or The Hot Zones, channels operated by Vivid Entertainment.
Bill Asher, company president, said the law caused some cable
operators to shy away from his programming.
</P>
<P>
   Partly as a result, Vivid has tried to grow its business among
satellite customers or on cable systems with up-to-date, digital
technology that could be more effectively scrambled, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''For us, this was a nuisance,'' Asher said. ''We believe the
new technology will solve our problems better than the Supreme
Court will.''
</P>
<P>
   Asher said he expected his competitors at Playboy to see the
most immediate benefits from the court decision. Since Playboy airs
less explicit material than Vivid's channels, its networks will be
more attractive to cable systems that have shied away from the
programming, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear how quickly cable systems that
carry these networks would begin showing them outside the 10 p.m.
to 6 a.m. time period.
</P>
<P>
   The decision should also eliminate an oddity that often angered
Playboy's Lynn. His company would occasionally sell some of its
programming to pay cable competitors like Cinemax or Showtime
which, because they were not considered sexually-oriented channels,
could air the material at any time.
</P>
<P>
   ''We always felt that logic was on our side in this battle,''
Lynn said.

<HEADLINE> Indians' Baez Promoted To Double-A  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Cuban pitcher Danys Baez, signed this winter to
a $14 million contract by Cleveland, was promoted to Double-A Akron
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians are being forced to make all kinds of moves because
of injuries to pitchers. Baez was a candidate to become Cleveland's
No. 5 starter during spring training, but began the year at Kinston
(A) of the Carolina League as the Indians chose to take their time
in developing the right-hander.
</P>
<P>
   After a slow start, Baez went 2-2 with a 4.71 ERA in nine
outings for Kinston. In his last two starts, the 22-year-old was
1-0 with a 0.71 ERA and had 16 strikeouts in 12 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians won a bidding war with several teams, including the
Atlanta Braves, and signed Baez last November. Cleveland committed
itself to a pitcher it barely knew and one it had mostly scouted on
videotape.
</P>
<P>
   Baez, who defected while playing for the Cuban national team
during the 1999 Pan Am Games in Winnipeg, struggled during training
camp while trying to adjust to his new life in the United States
and a new lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Once a $10 per month pitcher in Cuba, he was suddenly a
multimillionaire.
</P>
<P>
   In spring training, the 225-pound Baez's fastball rarely reached
90 mph and the curveball that made hitters' knees buckle on film
wasn't as sharp. He hadn't pitched for nearly seven months since
defecting just before the Aug. 1 gold-medal game in Winnipeg.
</P>
<P>
   Baez will make his debut for the Aeros at home Wednesday night
against New Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians wanted Baez to enjoy some success before bringing
him up through their system this season. However, injuries to
starters Jaret Wright and Charles Nagy and reliever Ricardo Rincon
has Cleveland making moves much earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Baez's promotion is likely to be followed on Tuesday with the
promotion of right-hander Tim Drew from Akron to start Wednesday
night's game against the Detroit Tigers. It would be Drew's major
league debut.
</P>
<P>
   Drew, the Indians' No. 1 pick in 1997, is 3-2 with a 2.42 ERA at
Akron. The 21-year-old younger brother of St. Louis outfielder J.D.
Drew is just one of a number of young pitching prospects the
Indians are counting on.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, 24-year-old Paul Rigdon made his big league debut
with the Indians and pitched seven shutout innings to beat the New
York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland made several other pitching moves Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Lorraine, released by the Chicago Cubs on May 11, was
signed to a minor-league contract and assigned to Triple-A Buffalo.
The 27-year-old lefty went 1-2 with a 6.47 ERA in eight games for
the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians also announced that Chad Ogea, who won two games in
the 1997 World Series for them, was placed on the 15-day disabled
list at Buffalo. Ogea was released by Tampa Bay on April 12 before
being signed by the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Ogea has elbow problems and is returning to Cleveland to be
examined. He lasted just 1 1-3 innings in his only start for the
Bisons.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Indians acquired right-hander Richie Lewis, 34, from
the New York Mets for a player to be named. Lewis was 3-4 with a
3.21 ERA in nine starts for Triple-A Norfolk.

<HEADLINE> Corzine on the trial in Trenton wins city mayor's endorsement  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- U.S. Senate candidate Jon Corzine hit the
capital city Monday, winning the mayor's backing and greeting
elderly residents at a once-derelict train station now in use as a
health and social center in one of the city's most depressed
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine is running against former Gov. Jim Florio, who had no
public campaign events Monday. Corzine began the day addressing a
postal-workers' union meeting in Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's appearances yielded a friendly response from Trenton's
poor elderly, most of them black and Hispanic, and most of them
unaware of who Corzine is. He briefly discussed his plan to expand
Medicare to include prescription drug coverage, but generally spent
his time in casual handshakes and small talk.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a friendly response from Mayor Douglas Palmer, a
Democrat who runs for office here in nonpartisan elections and thus
has remained somewhat aloof from partisan politics, allowing him to
shift easily into alliances with Republicans in control of his
city's main industry: state government.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine said he valued Palmer's backing, especially because of
this independence.
</P>
<P>
   ''He doesn't make endorsements on a regular basis,'' Corzine
said. ''We have spent a bunch of time together to talk about things
that I think we can do together, and I think he feels comfortable
that I am sincere about what I am going try to get accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer praised Corzine for addressing immunization and
children's health, job training and abandoned factory sites.
</P>
<P>
   ''In order to have the things that I want, I can't sit on the
sidelines,'' Palmer said. ''That is why it is very critical not
only for myself but for Trenton and New Jersey to get behind a man
like Jon Corzine, who has bold initiatives, who is not part of the
old regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Florio spokesman Jim Lanard said the former governor was
attending closed campaign events Monday, and he had no comment on
the Palmer endorsement.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Milosevic Group To Register  </HEADLINE>
By ALEKSANDAR VASOVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- In an attempt to stave off a
possible ban, a popular, pro-democracy student group ostracized by
Slobodan Milosevic's government announced Monday it will try to
register as an official organization.
</P>
<P>
   The group Otpor, which means Resistance, is known for its street
protests mocking Milosevic's autocratic rule. It has rapidly gained
popularity among opposition-minded Serbs who are fed up with
bickering among leaders of opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few weeks, Otpor has been blamed for the slaying
of a top official of Milosevic's ruling party and targeted by
police and the government as ''a terrorist group, fascists and
traitors.'' Dozens of its student activists have been arrested or
beaten.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to ease the pressure, the group announced Monday
it would try to register with the federal Ministry of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   ''We ... want to show that brutal force and intimidation cannot
suppress a democratic movement,'' said Branko Ilic, an Otpor
activist.
</P>
<P>
   A number of university professors, more than 50 members of the
Academy of Science, actors, musicians and other public figures
turned up Monday to sign Otpor's founding act, which is to be
submitted to the ministry for registration later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Several police officers monitored the founding ceremony at
Belgrade's independent Media Center. No arrests were made, but
earlier Monday a group of young men dressed in black and shouting
''Traitors'' and ''Fascists,'' interrupted another Otpor gathering
at Belgrade's University.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Milosevic's government cracked down on Belgrade's
main independent media, seizing the opposition-run Studio B
television and popular B2-92 radio station. The government proposed
a restrictive ''anti-terrorist'' law, which would allow it to ban
opposition parties and groups and arrest their leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe accused Yugoslav Information Minister Goran Matic of
threatening one of the group's representatives.
</P>
<P>
   The 54-nation OSCE said in a statement that Matic sent Freimut
Duve, the group's representative on media freedom, a letter
accusing Duve of being an ''accomplice in a crime'' by urging the
government to stop cracking down on the independent media.
</P>
<P>
   ''Support for independent media is defined as 'terrorism and a
crime against a sovereign state,''' Matic said, according to the
OSCE statement.
</P>
<P>
   The OSCE said it called on Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic to
clarify whether he personally supported Matic's views.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders announced another major anti-government rally
for Saturday titled ''For Serbia, without terror and fear - for
freedom of Studio B and other media.''
</P>
<P>
   Vuk Draskovic, leader of the Serbian Renewal Movement, the
single largest opposition party, told reporters that ''complete
media darkness reigned'' in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate development, the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry
protested Sunday to the European Union over a ban on trade and
finance between most EU member countries and Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   A senior European official said that international sanctions
against the Belgrade regime would remain as long as the Yugoslav
president rules.
</P>
<P>
   ''However, the Pact has a vacant seat for Serbia, the Pact waits
for Serbia to join, ... when things change,'' said Bodo Hombach,
coordinator of the Stability Pact for Southeast Europe.

<HEADLINE> Whitman high court nominee clears first confirmation test  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Gov. Christie Whitman's sixth nominee to
the state Supreme Court cleared his first legislative hurdle Monday
without a word of opposition from lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   James R. Zazzali's appointment now goes to the full state
Senate, after an unanimous vote to approve his nomination by the
Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   If ultimately confirmed, Zazzali would replace Associate Justice
Daniel O'Hern, who reaches the mandatory retirement age of 70 on
May 23.
</P>
<P>
   A Democrat, Zazzali served as an assistant prosecutor when
former Gov. Brendan Byrne was the Essex County prosecutor. As
governor, Byrne later named Zazzali his attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Byrne told the Senate panel that a former president of a state
lawyers association called Zazzali the finest appointment yet by
Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would certainly say that Jim Zazzali fits that bill,'' Byrne
said. ''All I can say is I'm proud of him. You should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Byrne was retired Associate Justice Stewart G. Pollock,
a Republican who said Zazzali works across party and ideological
lines.
</P>
<P>
   ''You may never have an easier decision than the one you have
before you today,'' Pollock said.
</P>
<P>
   Zazzali faced only brief questioning from senators on issues
including the role of the judiciary and the needs of the court
system.
</P>
<P>
   ''I keenly believe the Legislature is the voice of the people,
and the judges and the justices should recognize that,'' Zazzali
said.
</P>
<P>
   Zazzali served as attorney general for 10 months at the end of
former Gov. Brendan Byrne's term in 1981 and 1982. He also served
as general counsel to the New Jersey Sports and Exposition
Authority under Byrne.
</P>
<P>
   Zazzali, who turns 63 on June 17, is the oldest person Whitman
has nominated. While all Supreme Court justices must be confirmed
for lifetime tenure by the Senate after seven years, this will not
be an issue for Zazzali since he will hit mandatory retirement in
2007.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the chief justice, the six associate justices are
supposed to be evenly split, three Republicans and three Democrats.
Since O'Hern is a Democrat, tradition holds that he be replaced
with someone from the same party.
</P>
<P>
   Zazzali was a commissioner on the State Commission of
Investigation from 1984 to 1994, including a period as chairman.
The SCI is an independent office created by the Legislature to
examine and issue written reports on corruption and policy
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman last year named Zazzali to a search committee to find
candidates for State Police superintendent. He also headed a
coalition of six former state attorneys general who supported
former Attorney General Peter Verniero's hotly contested nomination
to the high court.
</P>
<P>
   Zazzali, of Rumson, is a partner in the Newark law firm Zazzali,
Zazzali, Fagella &AMP; Nowak with his brother, Andrew Zazzali. He
graduated from Georgetown University in 1958 and earned a law
degree there in 1962.

<HEADLINE> Disabled Golfer Fails To Advance  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COYNE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Ford Olinger, who has a degenerative hip
disease and unsuccessfully sued the U.S. Golf Association for the
right to ride a cart, used a walker for nine holes Monday, but
failed to advance out of qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   Olinger shot a 19-over-par 90 in intermittent showers at the
South Bend Country Club and said he won't try to qualify for the
U.S. Open again unless he gets permission to use a cart.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I can't ride I can't play,'' he said. ''I'm not coming out
here and doing this. I'm hurting too much right now. My chest is
hurting because of all the drugs I'm taking. There's just no way.''
</P>
<P>
   Olinger, 33, is still appealing a ruling in March by the 7th
U.S. Circuit Court in Chicago that a cart would change the nature
of competition. That ruling came one day after the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court in San Francisco upheld a lower court ruling that allows
Casey Martin to ride a cart on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Both Olinger and Martin, who has a rare circulatory disease in
his right leg, sued under the Americans with Disabilities Act.
Olinger, a pro from Warsaw, Ind., contends it is unfair that Martin
can use a cart and he can't.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm in the same shoes. What's the difference?''
</P>
<P>
   Chad Collins, 21, of Cloverdale, who played with Olinger on
Monday, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know why they don't let him ride. It wouldn't bother
me if he rode,'' said Collins, who advanced to the next qualifying
round with a 3-under 68.
</P>
<P>
   Olinger said the pain started when it began raining on the
seventh hole, when he was 6 over.
</P>
<P>
   ''The knees started to lock in and then the hips started aching,
then I had to watch every step, because it jolts me pretty good,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Olinger's limp grew worse as the round wore on. At times he
stopped, bent over and rested with his hands just above his knees.
Other times he sat down on a seat on the Lunar Swedish Rollator, a
device he used to steady his gait and relieve pressure on his back.
The USGA gave him permission to use the device.
</P>
<P>
   Olinger's brother, Maury, caddied for him, and his mother,
Donna, followed along for support. She also watched two years ago
when her son shot an 83 after a a federal judge granted him a
temporary restraining order, forcing the USGA to allow him to ride
in the local qualifier. She didn't watch last year, though, when he
shot an 88.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't want to see him in such pain,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Olinger said the walker helped relieve some of the pain Monday.
He didn't use it on the front nine because it is more hilly, which
makes pushing the device harder. But without a cart, Olinger said
he simply can't compete.
</P>
<P>
   Four golfers advanced to the next round. Medalist Chad Jones
shot a 66. John Connelly finished second at 67. Collins and Steve
Stone each shot 68.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Ends Down 26; Dow Down 84  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Wall Street endured another roller-coaster
session Monday, with market averages recovering from punishing
losses and finishing only moderately lower. The market's volatility
underscored investors' nervousness, particularly about high-tech
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   At its low point, the Nasdaq composite index wiped out virtually
all the spectacular gains it piled on from early November until
March 10, when it peaked at 5,048.62. Although bargain hunters
salvaged the session, analysts say the index remains highly
vulnerable amid fears that corporate earnings will be hurt by
rising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq closed down 26.19 at 3,364.21. At its low, the Nasdaq
was off nearly 218 points at 3,172.65 -- a level not seen since last
fall, when the index began its record-breaking ascent.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average nearly matched the Nasdaq in
volatility, plummeting more than 250 points before clawing back and
finishing down 84.30 at 10,542.55. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell
6.23 to 1,400.72.
</P>
<P>
   The latest wave of worry about technology stocks dominated
trading. Analysts said investors have decided that their exuberance
for high-tech and Internet stocks -- which gave the Nasdaq an
unprecedented 86 percent gain last year -- was either unjustified or
premature, given the upward trend in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ''The specter of inflation brings to a focus the importance
investors need to place on earnings, or the lack thereof,'' said
Michael K. Farr, president of financial consulting firm Farr,
Miller &AMP; Washington in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Higher interest rates can hurt corporate profits by raising
borrowing costs. Since many newer technology companies have slim
earnings, some investors feel they will be most compromised by
rising rates.
</P>
<P>
   Many fledgling technology companies were knocked lower in April,
when the Nasdaq sustained its initial wave of selling. This time,
however, investors focused their ire on the most established names
in technology.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle fell 2\ to 67 13/16, Microsoft fell ~ to 64 3/16 and
Motorola fell 2 1/16 to 87~.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think the correction for technology stocks still has
further to go,'' said Thomas McManus, equity portfolio strategist
at Banc of America Securities in New York. Even the bellwether
names, which attracted investors in the wake of April's technology
selloff, are now under escalating pressure, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had suggested that investors increase the quality and
liquidity of tech stock holdings in anticipation of a sharp
correction, but the risk remains that technology blue-chips become
increasingly overvalued and overowned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts are holding to the view that the current weakness
is washing out the exuberance that dominated the market at the
close of 1999 and in early 2000. But with the damage mounting,
investors are struggling to determine which technology stocks -- if
any -- are worthy of their still-high prices.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said many of the fledgling companies whose prices
soared at the height of the technology boom may never recover. More
established companies, however, remain solid investments and are
becoming relative bargains. Their reduced prices helped lure buyers
late in Monday's session.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco, which fell steeply in early trading, ended up 1 13/16 at
55\.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fundamentals of the technology sector are still there,''
Farr said. ''But no longer will being a dot-com get you a
following. You have to have strong, growing earnings and a clear
business plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates remain the stock market's greatest obstacle,
analysts said. Last week, the Federal Reserve raised rates for the
sixth time since last June, and left open the possibility of
further increases.
</P>
<P>
   Recent economic data have not made it clear whether the Fed's
rate increases are successfully slowing the economy, and the next
major report won't hit the market until Thursday, when the Commerce
Department issues a preliminary report on the gross domestic
product during the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Dow's losses came from General Motors, which fell 9
9/16 to 77]. The company is allowing shareholders to swap stock for
a tracking stock in Hughes Electronics, a wholly owned subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of the Hughes tracking stock rose 6~ to 96} in active
trading. Heavy demand persuaded GM to accept only 25 percent of the
shares offered. That prompted selling of GM shares by investors who
were denied in their attempt to swap them.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume totaled 1.04
billion shares, compared with 1.06 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   Relatively light volume was a clear contrast to the panicky
selling that dragged the Nasdaq lower in April. Yet many analysts
believe it would take a high-volume, full-bore selloff to drive the
Nasdaq to a level that would seriously attract bargain hunters and
allow the index to rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 8.04 to 471.67.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 2.8 percent as
leading technology stocks fell steeply. Germany's Xetra DAX index
fell 1.1 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 0.2 percent, and
France's CAC-40 fell 1.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> S.C. Gets NCAA Tournament Top Seed  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS WASZAK Jr.
<TEXT>
<P>
   South Carolina was selected the top seed and five other
Southeastern Conference teams were included in the 64-team Division
I college baseball tournament field announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Gamecocks (52-8), ranked No. 1 in national polls for most of
the season, will play Liberty on Friday in the first round of the
double-elimination tournament which leads to the College World
Series in Omaha, Neb.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't wait to see South Carolina play,'' said Dick Rockwell,
chairman of the NCAA selection committee. ''Any team that wins 50
games, I would think would have to be the favorite.''
</P>
<P>
   The other seeded teams include Louisiana State (43-17), Georgia
Tech (47-14), Clemson (45-16), Houston (44-15), Florida State
(45-15), Arizona State (42-13) and Stanford (42-13).
</P>
<P>
   Alabama, Auburn, Florida and Mississippi State received
automatic bids to join South Carolina and LSU as SEC teams in the
tournament. The Atlantic Coast Conference and Big 12 each have five
teams in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell said the committee puts most of its focus on strength
of conference and strength of non-conference schedules when
selecting at-large teams.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no one I feel we left out of this tournament,''
Rockwell said, adding that the committee spent 11 hours Sunday and
2{ more Monday preparing the brackets ''The parity pleases us. The
new teams please us. What we're hearing already from the sites
about attendance pleases us. And when you look at the possibility
of the super-regional matchups, we really have the makings of some
real exciting baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to South Carolina, the other regional hosts are
Arizona State, Baylor, Cal State-Fullerton, Clemson, Florida State,
Georgia Tech, Houston, Louisiana-Lafayette, Louisiana State, Miami,
Minnesota, Mississippi State, Oklahoma, Rutgers and Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   The Fullerton, Calif., regional with Cal State-Fullerton,
Southern California, Loyola Marymount and Virginia Tech, and the
Oklahoma City regional with UCLA, Oklahoma, Oral Roberts and
Delaware are expected to be among the most competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Miami (37-17-1) makes its 28th consecutive tournament appearance
to extend its NCAA record and will try to join Texas (1949 and
'50), USC (1970-74), Stanford (1987-88) and LSU (1996-97) as the
only repeat champions.
</P>
<P>
   There are 26 schools in this year's field that didn't play in
the tournament last year, three of which are making their first
NCAA tournament appearances: Army (24-18-1), Butler (31-26) and
Wagner (24-28-1). The Seahawks, who won the Northeast Conference
tournament, are one of three schools in the tournament with a
losing record. Southwestern Athletic Conference tournament champion
Jackson State (26-28) and Sun Belt winner South Alabama (27-31) are
also in.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose State (36-20) is making its first tournament appearance
since 1971, while Penn State (41-16) is making its first since
1976.
</P>
<P>
   While schools like Oklahoma State, not in the tournament for the
first time since 1981, Pepperdine and Georgia were considered but
ultimately left out of the tournament field, Rockwell said the
committee is pleased with its decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel a lot better about the field this year than I did last
year at this time,'' Rockwell said. ''We had a group of about
seven, eight or nine teams that we considered, but there wasn't
really a 65th team.''
</P>
<P>
   The regionals are played on campus fields, except for Rutgers
and Oklahoma. The Rutgers regional will be played at Yogi Berra
Stadium in Upper Montclair, N.J., and the Oklahoma regional will be
played at Bricktown Ballpark in Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   The winners of each regional advance to one of eight
best-of-three super regionals on June 2. The super-regional winners
advance to the College World Series in Omaha, Neb., which starts
June 9.

<HEADLINE> Barak Seeks US, UN Aid in Pullout  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As Israel's security belt inside southern
Lebanon collapsed Monday, Prime Minister Ehud Barak sought the help
of the United States and the United Nations for a peaceful pullout
of Israeli troops this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright responded with telephone
calls to Arab leaders and a statement saying ''there can be no
justification for initiating acts of violence'' while Israel was
carrying out a withdrawal called for by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking by satellite to a conference of the most influential
pro-Israel lobby in the United States, Barak said he would hold
Syria and Lebanon accountable if the withdrawal was marked by
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Barak squeezed in the speech to 2,000 members of the American
Israeli Public Affairs Committee amid hurried telephone
consultation with Albright and senior Israeli military officers.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, meanwhile, consulted by telephone with U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and leaders of Lebanon, Syria, Egypt
and Saudi Arabia, as well as with Barak.
</P>
<P>
   She then called on all parties ''to exercise maximum restraint
and refrain from any acts of violence.'' She also urged support for
Annan as he tries to minimize civilian casualties and help
stabilize the region.
</P>
<P>
   With the situation along the border with Lebanon growing more
tense by the day, Barak said Albright had assured him the United
States would play a role in the pullout -- one that he did not spell
out -- and that he wanted the U.N. Security Council to endorse the
withdrawal as well.
</P>
<P>
   Albright has expressed support for Barak's decision, but has not
said whether the United States would provide concrete help.
Meanwhile, the administration is calliing on other governments to
endorse the pullout and wants it carried out through the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   As Barak spoke, Israeli-allied militiamen, who could be treated
harshly for helping Israel to maintain the security zone for 22
years, fled in panic toward Israel's border. Hundreds of Lebanese
civilians rushed forward to fill the vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   Syria, which wields effective control over Lebanon, wants any
Israeli pullout accompanied by surrender of the Golan Heights, the
strategic plateau it lost in the 1967 Mideast war. But unable to
come to terms with Syria, Barak intends to get Israeli troops out
of Lebanon rather than take more casualties at the hands of
militant guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are determined to pull out in the near future,'' Barak
said. ''I would not recommend to anyone to try us once we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the pullout has already begun in bits and pieces.
Barak may be positioning himself to complete it before a
self-imposed July 7 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, his warning to Lebanon and Syria was unqualified.
''We hold the Lebanese and Syrian governments responsible to make
sure it will be quiet,'' the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak told American Israeli Public Affairs Committee members
that a quarter-million Israelis in northern villages were compelled
to take refuge in shelters from cross-border attacks. ''They may
have to stay there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said confidently, ''We will prevail and we will pull out
of Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak had been scheduled to attend the conference and probably
to meet with President Clinton at the White House, but the violence
in southern Lebanon and on the West Bank caused him to cancel the
trip.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the tensions, U.S. mediator Dennis B. Ross assured the
pro-Israel group that Israel and the Arabs ''have come a long way''
toward peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no question there is a promise of success,'' Ross
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the American official, who shuttled between Washington and
the Middle East for talks with Israel and Palestinian leaders and
also participated in secret negotiations in Stockholm, Sweden, said
agreements cannot be reached with violence.

<HEADLINE> D.C. United Sign Pete Marino  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HERNDON, Va. (AP) -- Off to their worst start in franchise
history, D.C. United signed forward Pete Marino on Monday to boost
their struggling scoring attack.
</P>
<P>
   Marino has scored 21 goals over four MLS seasons with Columbus,
Kansas City and Tampa Bay, but 11 of those came in his first season
with Columbus in 1996. He was waived by Tampa Bay in March.
</P>
<P>
   United, the three-time MLS champion, are 2-9-1 and in last place

without putting the ball in the net. The team had to trade prolific
scorer Roy Lassiter last year for salary cap reasons, and Jaime
Moreno is the only United forward who has scored this season.
</P>
<P>
   Marino is expected to play in Saturday's home game against
Dallas.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Silver survives leadership vote by fellow Democrats  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver
survived a challenge to his job Monday, but not before nearly three
hours of public criticism from fellow Democrats about how he runs
the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   A proposal to change the rules to allow an immediate vote on
Silver's speakership failed 63-85, or by 13 votes in the 149-member
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   It was no surprise that the challenge launched by the former
Democratic majority leader, Michael Bragman, failed. He
acknowledged Monday morning he did not have the votes to supplant
Silver among Democrats in the chamber and instead would turn his
campaign to become speaker into an effort to reform the rules of
the house.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, 19 Assembly Democrats voted to suspend the rules.
They were joined by 44 minority Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The vote represented the remnants of a six-day-long rebellion by
Bragman which began spreading by rumors and word of mouth during
last Tuesday's Democratic state convention in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, Bragman announced he had a ''rock-solid'' core
of Democrats -- at one point he said it was 53 -- who favored him
over Silver as new speaker. That number would have been enough to
make Bragman the new speaker in a closed vote among the 98 Assembly
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But Bragman conceded that number shrunk among what he called
''bludgeoning'' and ''threatening'' by Silver and the speaker's
allies since last week.
</P>
<P>
   There were only 19 Democrats willing to stand with Bragman at a
news conference Monday in which he said he was forming a Democratic
Majority Reform Caucus to promote reform in the operation of the
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Following his defeat on the floor, Bragman insisted, ''The
speaker is fatally wounded'' and said his Democrat-led group will
eventually prove to be the speaker's undoing.
</P>
<P>
   Silver scheduled a news conference Tuesday to discuss the
leadership fight.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's vote followed an extraordinary display of disaffection
by more than a dozen Democrats in a chamber where Democrats rarely
air unhappiness with leaders publicly.
</P>
<P>
   In a dramatic 15-minute address before a jammed and tense
chamber, Bragman accused Silver of letting lobbyists and
non-elected staff members control legislation instead of lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has been listening for years to members complain
about how hard it is to even see Silver face-to-face.
</P>
<P>
   He contended the conference committees by which small portions
of the last three state budgets were negotiated have been shams
controlled by legislative leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman even said, ''It is wrong to treat the members from the
minority side with such disrespect.'' Republicans in the Assembly --
like Democrats in the Republican-dominated state Senate -- have
essentially no input on legislation and usually cannot even ''sign
on'' to Democratic bills as sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not about my personal ambition,'' Bragman said. ''It
could not have been with some many involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Bragman, stripped of his majority leader's job and perks when he
went public last week with his challenge against Silver, received a
standing ovation from the 51 Republicans in the Assembly and from
his Democratic allies while the other Democrats sat silent.
</P>
<P>
   Silver allies fired back.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Richard Brodsky of Westchester County said the
resolution before the Assembly Monday ''isn't the vehicle'' and
Bragman ''isn't the man'' to correct the complaints being voiced
against Silver.
</P>
<P>
   ''The notion that unreturned phone calls or inappropriate staff
acts -- which will happen, under anyone -- are grounds for
impeachment, is ludicrous,'' Brodsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Clarence Norman, the Brooklyn Democratic leader and
the deputy majority leader, said the Bragman forces ''failed
miserably'' to meet their burden of proving why Silver should not
remain speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ''I say you change leadership when institutions are paralyzed
with corruption or blatant incompetency,'' said Norman, rumored to
be one of Bragman's possible successors, ''and certainly no one can
say our Speaker Sheldon Silver is incompetent or corrupt.''
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo Assemblyman Arthur Eve, a Silver backer who was first
elected in 1966, urged the dissidents to back down and work with
Silver to resolve their problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't destroy this institution,'' he pleaded.
</P>
<P>
   A close Silver partisan, Assemblyman Herman Farrell of
Manhattan, predicted that Republicans would use the disharmony
among Assembly Democrats among the party's candidates this
November.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't find the words here to make it go away,'' Farrell
said. ''It needs to go away.''
</P>
<P>
   A Bragman ally, Martin Luster of Tompkins County, was one of two
insurgents so far to be penalized by Silver. Both he and Ronald
Tocci of Westchester County lost their committee chairmanships and
$12,500-a-year stipends for joining Bragman's team.
</P>
<P>
   Luster said he is a ''big boy'' and understands there are
penalties to pay for being on the wrong side of a coup against a
political leader.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I am not willing to accept the notion that with our vote
today that this house is in good order, that we run it as a
democratic institution,'' Luster said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bragman before him, Luster said he was at ease because he
feels he can speak his mind about how the Assembly is run.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have never felt as liberated as I do as this moment,''
Luster said. ''I have never felt so sure of myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Bragman, from suburban Syracuse, and the Manhattanite Silver had
maintained an uneasy alliance in the Assembly since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman said Silver threatened to run many members with
Democratic primary opponents this year or to redistrict them out of
office in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ''I cannot be angry because I know what you went through,''
Bragman told his Democratic colleagues Monday. ''I think you for
hanging on as long as you could.''

<HEADLINE> Mother of bombing victim seeks more disclosure on day-care centers  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Parents whose children attend day-care
centers in federal buildings should be given more information about
those buildings, the mother of a child killed in the Oklahoma City
bombing said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Aren Almon-Kok endorsed ''Baylee's Law,'' which would require
the agency that runs federal buildings to tell parents of any
threats to those buildings, as well as what tenants are in the
building, and the security designation of the building.
</P>
<P>
   Such information about the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma
City would not have dissuaded Almon-Kok from placing her daughter
in its day-care center, but it would have given her a complete
picture, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I took my daughter there thinking it was the safest building.
It turned out not to be the case,'' Almon-Kok said outside a
day-care center in the Rodino Federal Building here.
</P>
<P>
   One-year-old Baylee Almon became a symbol of the 1995 bombing
through a picture of her body being carried from the rubble of the
Murrah Federal Building by a firefighter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had no idea that was a high-risk federal building,''
Almon-Kok said. She chose it because it was across the street from
her home, but never learned it was the target of several bomb
threats, Almon-Kok said.
</P>
<P>
   She appeared with Rep. Robert Franks, R-N.J., who is to
introduce the bill Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This legislation can provide a new level of protection for the
7,600 children who are now being cared for at child care centers
located in 114 federal buildings across the country,'' said Franks,
chairman of the House public buildings subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Federal buildings are rated one to five on security risk, with
all courthouses getting a five, the highest rating, said Franks,
who is seeking the Republican nomination for Senate in next month's
primary election.
</P>
<P>
   Parents whose children attended the Murrah center did not know
it ''housed a variety of federal agencies that are often the target
of terrorist threats -- including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms ...''
</P>
<P>
   A building directory is insufficient notice, Franks said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if potential terrorists would target low-rated buildings
because the facility might have less protection, Franks said, ''We
don't believe it compromises security merely to disclose that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rodino day-care center, which tends to about 46 children a
day, is rated four, said its director, Lisa Russo-Parone.
</P>
<P>
   She said about half the children have parents who work in the
building, which has offices for the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, the Internal Revenue Service, and the U.S. Attorney.
</P>
<P>
   The federal courthouse is across a street that, along with
others in the area, has been closed to traffic since the Oklahoma
bombing that killed 168. The ATF is based in another location.
</P>
<P>
   Security rankings were implemented after the Oklahoma bombing,
said Renee Miscione, a spokeswoman for the General Services
Administration, which oversees 8,300 federal buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The agency will not comment until it has reviewed the proposed
law, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Almon-Kok is now spokeswoman for the Protecting People First
Foundation, a private group created by a Rhode Island company that
sells and installs shatterproof glass to raise awareness about the
deadly effects of flying glass caused by a bombing or natural
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   She praised the Rodino day-care center for installing such
protection, and Franks said all 114 centers in federal buildings
would get similar upgrades.

<HEADLINE> FEC Battle Delays Judge Nominees  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Federal Election Commission nominee's views
on campaign finance law and Democrats' desire to debate them
extensively continued to hold up Senate action Monday on more than
70 of President Clinton's nominees for federal judgeships and
administration jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unless we can get an agreement to have some debate time and a
vote sewn up ..., then 72 nominations are in jeopardy,'' Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott said shortly after recessing a
deadlocked Senate early in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, R-Miss., and Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D.,
had agreed to holding a vote on FEC nominee Bradley A. Smith, who
is opposed by several Democrats, in exchange for getting several
federal judicial nominees through the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   However, Democrats who want to put new restrictions on who can
contribute to political campaigns and how much objected to the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''Senate confirmation of Brad Smith could affect the
administration of the federal election laws for years to come,''
Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., said Friday. ''I objected ...
because I felt that the majority was acting too hastily. The
proposal contemplated too little debate and a vote occurring too
soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle and Lott had agreed to allow senators to hold a debate
on Smith for more than 10 hours, then a debate on a couple of the
judges and then approve a block of non-controversial nominees,
including most of the judges. The more controversial nominees like
Smith would be voted on separately.
</P>
<P>
   Several Democrats say Smith is an unacceptable choice for the
FEC because of his belief that government should not limit the size
of campaign contributions. At his confirmation hearing, Smith told
senators that he would enforce campaign law as it is rather than as
he wishes it would be but that assurance failed to placate his
foes.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who teaches at Capital University Law School in Columbus,
Ohio, said he feels confident of his chances if he gets a vote. ''I
think everybody agrees a majority of the Senate would vote to
confirm me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has been the bargaining chip for Democrats to get some of
President Clinton's judicial nominations through the
Republican-controlled Senate. Republicans, looking to regain the
White House next November after eight years of Clinton's
presidency, have done little this year to expedite approval of
Clinton's nominees.
</P>
<P>
   ''We basically offered up to 72 nominations, including 16
judges, and all that's required is a vote on a couple of FEC
nominations and a couple of judges,'' Lott said. ''If the Democrats
object to a package like this, it doesn't look like they want to
get any more nominations done this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The 72 nominations include positions at the State, Justice and
Treasury departments and seats on the Harry Truman Scholarship
Foundation and even the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority.
Until they can get all of the nominations cleared, everything was
''pretty much'' stuck, Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   Only seven judges have been approved by the Senate this year. In
addition to the 16 on the Senate floor calendar are another 36 are
awaiting approval by the Senate Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Renit Schmelzer, a spokeswoman for Daschle, D-S.D., said the
holdup is ''senators on our side wanting the debate to happen on
Wednesday and Thursday when everybody was here and could hear them
and stuff. Lott wanted the debate to happen today. That's what it's
bogged down over.''
</P>
<P>
   Many senators do not return to the capital from their home
states on Mondays.

<HEADLINE> Nader Group Seeks Lott Ethics Probe  </HEADLINE>
By NEDRA PICKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A watchdog group affiliated with Ralph Nader
asked the Senate Ethics Committee on Monday to investigate Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
   Citing newspaper reports, the Congressional Accountability
Project asked the ethics panel to assess whether Lott, R-Miss.,
pressured high-tech lobbyists for contributions to a nonprofit
group in attempt to assist the re-election efforts of Sen. Spencer
Abraham, R-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham is sponsoring a bill supported by the lobbyists that
would allow 297,500 more visas for skilled foreign workers to enter
the country and work in U.S. companies. High-tech firms say there
is a shortage of qualified American workers and they need
immigrants to fill the positions.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit group, Americans for Job Security, stepped up for
Abraham after a series of ads criticized him and the visa
legislation. The group responded with ads in Michigan defending
Abraham and criticizing his challenger, Democratic Rep. Debbie
Stabenow.
</P>
<P>
   ''The heart of the matter here is whether Senate Majority Leader
Lott corruptly put legislative action up for sale and engaged in an
advanced form of arm-twisting,'' Gary Ruskin, the Nader group's
director, said in the complaint. ''This renting of influence and
abuse of power, if true, subverts the democratic process.''
</P>
<P>
   Victor Baird, chief counsel for the Senate Ethics Committee,
said ethics investigations are confidential and committee members
and staff cannot even confirm that they received a complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Lott's spokesman, John Czwartacki, has denied that the senator
did anything unethical.
</P>
<P>
   ''These charges are baseless, politically motivated and have no
merit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According e-mails obtained by The Washington Post, The
Associated Press and other news organizations, some lobbyists
appeared to believe that if they didn't donate to Americans for Job
Security, the visa bill would not move.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have heard that regardless of our 'limitations,' we need to
do something for Abraham if we want to see something moved in the
Senate,'' one lobbyist wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Lott and Abraham have said the senators have long
been supporters of increasing the number of visas and denied that
donations were tied to the bill.

<HEADLINE> Jury Selected In Lewis Murder Trial  </HEADLINE>
By CHAD ROEDEMEIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- A false statement given to police by Baltimore
Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis is admissible as evidence in his murder
trial, a Superior Court judge ruled Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys argued that two Atlanta police officers
coerced the statement by threatening to destroy Lewis' pro football
career if he didn't cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   But Superior Court Judge Alice D. Bonner ruled the statement was
''freely and voluntarily given'' and allowed it to be admitted as
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, a three-time NFL All-Pro, and two co-defendants, Reginald
Oakley and Joseph Sweeting, are charged in the Jan. 31 stabbing
deaths of Jacinth ''Shorty'' Baker, 21, and Richard Lollar, 24,
during a brawl following a post-Super Bowl party.
</P>
<P>
   Opening statements start Tuesday, and the trial is expected to
last several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A jury of 10 blacks and two whites was chosen Monday. It is
composed of nine black women, one black man, one white man and one
white woman. The five alternate jurors are three black women, one
white woman and one white man.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys said they were pleased with the jury. They
said they managed to get rid of the potential jurors most dangerous
to the defense.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't use all of our strikes,'' said Bruce Harvey,
Oakley's attorney. ''That should be an indication of how the
defense collectively feels about the jury.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense could have eliminated 12 potential jurors, but used
only 10 ''strikes'' during the selection. The prosecution used all
six of its strikes.
</P>
<P>
   After jury selection, the most significant issue remaining
Monday was whether to admit Lewis' statement to police.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who was staying at a friend's house in Norcross on the
morning after the killing, refused to go to the police station and
give a statement based on the advice of a lawyer. Instead, he
agreed to give a written statement to Atlanta police Lt. Michael
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   In that statement, Lewis named only two people in the Lincoln
Navigator limousine that was seen speeding away from the scene. He
did not name either Sweeting or Oakley.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was leaving ... Cobalt nightclub,'' Lewis' statement said.
''And on my way to my limousine ... a fight broke out way up past
my limousine. We saw it, I grabbed my people, we hopped in my
truck, we left. While we're driving off, we heard gun shots. We
left the scene, and that is basically it.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith testified Monday that he told Lewis that if he didn't
cooperate as a witness it could embarrass him, the Baltimore Ravens
and the NFL. Lewis' lawyers said Smith coerced Lewis into
testifying.
</P>
<P>
   Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard said he was pleased
to see the judge reject the motion to suppress Lewis' statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's always important for the jurors to hear from the
defendant himself,'' Howard said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have said in court documents that the defendants
chased down Baker and Lollar, and started fighting with them after
an argument at the Cobalt Lounge. Defense lawyers for Lewis have
said the 25-year-old NFL star didn't stab anyone and acted as a
peacemaker.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Lewis didn't actually stab anyone, he can be convicted
of murder if the prosecution can convince a jury that Lewis
participated in the brawl that led to the two deaths.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, all three could be sentenced to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   During the weekend, prosecutors secured the testimony of Rehana
Grant, one of the women riding in Lewis' limousine the night of the
killings. Grant has been given immunity in exchange for her
testimony, according to her lawyer, Cynthia Roseberry. Grant is the
third person in the limo to get immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Also, forensic DNA expert Henry Lee, who worked for O.J.
Simpson's defense team, is now listed as a prosecution witness.

<HEADLINE> Four Republican hopefuls to crowd the stage for cable TV debate  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDISON, N.J. (AP) -- The four candidates for the Republican
nomination for U.S. Senate are scheduled to appear
shoulder-to-shoulder for a live debate on cable television Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It is the second time U.S. Rep. Bob Franks, R-New Providence;
state Sen. William Gormley, R-Atlantic; Essex County executive Jim
Treffinger; and Ramapo College professor Murray Sabrin will appear
before TV cameras.
</P>
<P>
   But the confrontation has taken on greater importance as the
first of three debates this week, capped by an appearance on ABC-TV
network stations for all four of them this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The primary is June 6. The contest has been somewhat
overshadowed thus far by the Democratic primary between the
high-spending Jon Corzine and former Gov. Jim Florio.
</P>
<P>
   Franks and Gormley are seen as the leaders of the pack based on
support from within the ranks of the Republican Party, although the
few polls taken suggest all of them are close and are virtually
unknown to voters. Treffinger has a formidable base of support in
Essex and Passaic counties, and has joined the two leaders in
raising more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   While the three GOP campaigns try to dismiss Sabrin, who until
recently was a Libertarian, few outside observers are willing to do
so because of his appeal to anti-abortion and antigun control
elements of the party that can be quite active at primary time.
Franks, Gormley and Treffinger all fashion themselves as GOP
moderates, supporting abortion rights with restrictions and
proposing more clamps on gun sales.
</P>
<P>
   The four sparred early in the campaign on May 8 in a debate
televised on the New Jersey Network public television station.
Monday's debate is being hosted by News 12 New Jersey, a cable TV
news channel.
</P>
<P>
   As at the NJN forum, the News 12 debate will confine the large
group of candidates to answering reporters' questions within set
time limits, which may restrict how much they are able to attack
one another or provide vivid contrasts to their platforms in a
50-minute time frame.

<HEADLINE> Flyers' Langkow Returns For Game 5  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Philadelphia Flyers forward Daymond Langkow
returned for Game 5 of the Eastern Conference finals against New
Jersey on Monday night after sitting out two games with a
concussion.
</P>
<P>
   The center, who had not missed a game since being acquired by
the Flyers in December 1998, was hurt in a collision with Devils
defenseman Scott Stevens about a minute after scoring the winning
goal in Philadelphia's 4-3 victory in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are no symptoms at all,'' Langkow said Monday after the
morning skate. ''I missed a couple of games but I don't think it
will take too much to get back in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Langkow, who has five goals in the playoffs, played in 138
consecutive regular-season games and 19 playoff games before the
injury.
</P>
<P>
   He was back in the starting lineup on the Flyers' top line
Monday between John LeClair and Mark Recchi and recorded
Philadelphia's first shot on goal.

<HEADLINE> FTC Asks For Web Privacy Laws  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a stark reversal of policy, the Federal
Trade Commission asked Congress on Monday for new authority to
regulate how companies use personal information collected on their
Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The commission recommended that lawmakers pass legislation to
bolster its ability to oversee online privacy, concluding that the
industry has failed to safeguard consumer privacy through
self-regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC voted 3-2 to send its decision to Capitol Hill and cited
the findings of a new report on online privacy. The FTC survey
found that only 20 percent of a random sample of all Web sites with
more than 39,000 visitors had implemented the four key components
of widely accepted fair information practices. Of the 100 most
popular U.S. commercial sites, only 42 percent had adopted these
standards.
</P>
<P>
   ''The study indicates that there is still a long way to go,''
said FTC Commissioner Mozelle Thompson in an interview. ''This is
something that consumers have gotten more and more concerned
about.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation recommended by the FTC would require commercial
Web sites to implement such principles as notifying consumers what
information is collected and how it will be used; the option to
choose whether information can be shared with third parties; access
to review information a site has collected; and security of that
information during transmission and storage.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's proposal still puts industry efforts at the
forefront, but gives the FTC the ability to address any gaps, said
Thompson. He stressed that the commission also wants to provide
enough flexibility to encourage innovation in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The report cited only a limited use of voluntary self-regulation
options such as programs run by the Better Business Bureau or
Truste, which audit companies to see whether they keep their
privacy promises to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Only 8 percent of all Web sites post privacy seals indicating
their participation in such programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The FTC has been very indulgent with businesses' slow progress
toward privacy protection,'' said Jason Catlett of Junkbusters
Corp., a New Jersey-based privacy advocate. ''The commission
properly made the decision this shouldn't be put off any longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry groups said privacy regulation could hinder the ability
of the Internet to respond quickly to new consumer demands and
would impose undue burdens on companies.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a little confounded that they think that at this juncture
they should jump in and regulate,'' said Christine Varney of the
Online Privacy Alliance, an industry trade group.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's starting down a slippery slope toward Internet regulation
which is unwarranted,'' said Harris Miller, president of the
Information Technology Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Orson Swindle, who voted against the
recommendations, said the FTC's plan doesn't adequately address why
new legislation is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Legislation should be reserved for problems that the market
cannot fix on its own,'' Swindle said. He also warned that any law
should consider ''unintended consequences that could severely
stifle the thriving New Economy.''
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear what prospects such legislation would have for
passage during an election year, and some lawmakers already have
questioned whether the industry really needs regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ''A vast number of sites disclose what their privacy policies
are and give consumers more control on what information is gathered
and how it will be used,'' said Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., chairman
House Commerce Committee's telecommunications, trade and consumer
protection panel.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., used the commission report
to press for legislation he introduced earlier this year that would
bolster privacy requirements on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ''People should not be forced to sacrifice their privacy rights
to the new technologies,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Suspect Arrested In Sealy's Death  </HEADLINE>
By ARNIE STAPLETON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The State Patrol on Monday arrested the
43-year-old man believed responsible for the wrong-way crash that
killed Minnesota Timberwolves swingman Malik Sealy.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have until noon Wednesday to present the case to
the Hennepin County Attorney's Office for formal charges against
Souksangouane Phengsene, of Minneapolis, who remained under guard
at Hennepin County Medical Center, where he's being treated for
serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Phengsene was driving the wrong way on
Highway 100 early Saturday morning when his pickup smashed into
Sealy's sports utility truck in the Minneapolis suburb of St. Louis
Park, fatally injuring the popular player who was returning from
teammate Kevin Garnett's 24th birthday celebration. Blood-alcohol
tests are under way.
</P>
<P>
   The Timberwolves are planning to take their charter airplane to
the funeral Friday on the campus of St. John's University, where
Sealy starred before being drafted by the Indiana Pacers in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   All the players except Rasho Nesterovic, who has returned to
Slovenia, are expected to attend the service.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Timberwolves coach Flip Saunders attended a memorial
ceremony for mentor Bill Musselman, who coached him at the
University of Minnesota in the 1970s and served as the Wolves'
first coach.
</P>
<P>
   Saunders broke down as a prayer at that service was said for
Sealy, who is survived by his newlywed wife, Lisa, and their
3-year-old son, Malik Remington.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had a tough time today,'' Saunders said. ''But I think it's
going to be that way for a while. It's going to be like that for
our players for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Sealy was coming off the best season of his eight-year NBA
career. After the Wolves stumbled to a terrible start, Sealy
cracked the starting lineup and sparked Minnesota to its best
season ever.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hear people say we had a great year, 50 wins. But that
doesn't matter. Because no matter what, this year will go down as a
loss,'' Saunders said.
</P>
<P>
   None of the players are talking to the media yet, but Wolves
vice president Kevin McHale said sadness had replaced shock
throughout the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just a tremendous loss for his friends, his family, his
wife, his son, teammates, college friends,'' McHale said. ''One
life touched so many different people.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Sealy released a statement saying the family was deeply
moved by the sympathy of the Timberwolves, the NBA, friends and the
public. She said the family was ''thankful to know that Malik was
loved by so many.''
</P>
<P>
   McHale said the team held no animosity for Phengsene, who will
be booked into the Hennepin County Jail to await formal charges
once he's released from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ''If being angry brought back Malik Sealy, I think we'd all be
angry,'' McHale said. ''But nothing anybody's going to do or say
right now is going to change the events of 4 a.m. on May 20. That's
written in stone.''
</P>
<P>
   Sealy was one of the more affable and intelligent players in pro
sports. He had parts in commercials and movies and was a successful
businessman. He played for the Pacers, Clippers and Pistons before
finding a niche with the tight knit Wolves.
</P>
<P>
   Saunders said that although Sealy was a free agent, he was
certain the 30-year-old guard/forward was planning to stay in
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   The grieving will take a long time because players are scattered
for the summer and will revisit the tragedy when they report to
camp, Saunders said.
</P>
<P>
   Saunders and McHale are particularly concerned about their star,
Garnett, who worshiped Sealy so much that he patterned his play
after him and chose No. 21 in his honor.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fortunate thing for Kevin is he had an opportunity to play
with somebody he idolized growing up,'' Saunders said. ''You don't
always have that opportunity. Malik touched his life and instilled
a lot of positive qualities in KG. So, yeah, we're concerned. ...''
</P>
<P>
   McHale said he'll draw on his experiences grieving the death of
Boston Celtics teammate Reggie Lewis, who died of heart failure in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   ''As time goes by, you do remember the smiles and the
laughter,'' McHale said. ''You remember a lot of the positive
things.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the pain subsides and the memories stay forever.''

<HEADLINE> Megan's mother testifies as sex offender amendment advances  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The mother of a girl raped and killed in
1994 by a convicted sex offender who lived across the street says
parents want information about such offenders posted on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Kanka told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday that
parents with whom she has spoken support a change to the state
constitution so they can have Internet access to sex offender
information.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Judiciary Committee and an Assembly committee on
Monday passed bills proposing the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say if this becomes law, New Jersey would be the
first state in the country with a constitutional guarantee to view
lists of molesters online.
</P>
<P>
   Kanka, whose daughter, Megan, was raped and killed in 1994 by a
sex offender who lived across the street from her Mercer County
home, told the Senate Judiciary Committee that, six years ago she
expected it would be easy to alert parents to the dangers of repeat
sex offenders.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was quite a simple thing to us,'' she said. But what
eventually became Megan's Law has been hampered by court
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Parents need the information to protect their children, Kanka
said. But as the law stands now, only parents who live in the same
neighborhood where sex offenders who are classified as dangerous
live get those details, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Having Internet access will be able to alert parents to look
beyond their streets,'' Kanka said.
</P>
<P>
   In her talks with parents, Kanka said many would gladly vote to
approve any amendment that would give them more information.
</P>
<P>
   ''They'd like to see better access,'' Kanka said.
</P>
<P>
   The public notifications now allowed by Megan's Law are on hold
while the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reviews the law.
Without the amendment, any plan to post the sex offender
information on the Internet would likely be struck down by the
courts.
</P>
<P>
   ''We shouldn't need a constitutional amendment to protect these
children but we do,'' said Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco,
R-Union, one of the bill sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   DiFrancesco said New Jersey is far behind other states that
allow much of the same sex offender details on Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   The only opposition came from the state chapter of the American
Civil Liberties Union and lawyer John J. Furlong, who represented
the sex offender in the first state Supreme Court case challenging
Megan's Law.
</P>
<P>
   Furlong told the senators they are free to post all criminal
convictions online now. But he also said they are just as free to
sponsor group therapy sessions for offenders to help treat the
underlying causes of the crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's cheap,'' Furlong said, ''and it works.''
</P>
<P>
   His suggestions elicited no comment from the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman offered both houses of the Legislature the
amendment on March 27. She also submitted legislation directing the
superintendent of the State Police to prepare the Internet
registry.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 8-0 to forward the bill.
The version in the Assembly cleared the Law and Public Safety
Committee by a vote of 7-0.
</P>
<P>
   Both bills now will be considered by each house. No public
hearing dates have been scheduled. If passed by the Legislature,
the amendment would be put to voters in November.
</P>
<P>
   For those sex offenders labeled a minimal risk, the amendment
would let the public submit a person's name and one other piece of
information, such as his home address, to see the Internet registry
about him.
</P>
<P>
   For those considered at moderate or high risk of re-offending,
the public simply would have to access the Internet registry. The
registry would contain the offender's name and aliases, any Megan's
Law offenses committed, his age, race, date of birth, height,
weight, hair and eye color, address and a photograph.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, for those considered at least risk, prosecutors tell
police departments that the offender is living in the community.
For those perceived to be at moderate or high risk of reoffending,
the law allows prosecutors to provide an offender's name, address
and photo to residents, schools and day care centers in a carefully
defined area.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Stories don't get much older than

<HEADLINE> Officer Testifies for Terror Suspect  </HEADLINE>
By JAMAL HALA
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- A man on trial for allegedly planning
terrorist attacks during the New Year was compiling information on
Israeli diplomats and Jordanian officials and businessmen, a police
officer testified Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Khader Abu Hosher is one of 28 men accused of being linked with
Saudi fugitive Osama bin Laden, who is wanted in the United States
for the 1998 bombing of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that
killed 224 people.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanian officials say the 28 accused Arabs, many of whom are
Jordanians of Palestinian descent, planned bomb attacks on U.S. and
Israeli tourists during millennium celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Mohammad Aramsheh told a state court Monday that a document
he seized from Abu Hosher's Amman office ''contained a list of
addresses of leading Jordanian authorities such as judicial,
military, security and managers of banks and hotels.''
</P>
<P>
   Aramsheh said he also seized a paper from Abu Hosher's office on
which was written: ''The first secretary of the Jewish Embassy
resides in Amra Hotel, the 21st floor, room 24.'' He did not
identify the diplomat by name.
</P>
<P>
   The police officer told the three-man tribunal the information
he seized was hidden inside a photocopier along with stamps of the
Syrian and Jordanian governments, the Palestine Liberation
Organization and its military intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Other material seized included expired American, Dutch, Iraqi,
Kuwaiti, Lebanese and Jordanian passports, identification cards
from Arab countries and maps of tourist sites in Jordan, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The trial, which opened April 20, involves 13 suspects who are
at large and 15 who have been in custody since December. The 15 --
13 Jordanians of Palestinian descent, an Iraqi and an Algerian --
have pleaded innocent.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants have been charged with various counts, including
possession of explosives and affiliation with ''an outlawed group''
involved in a ''conspiracy to carry out terrorist attacks'' in
Jordan.

<HEADLINE> Court Overturns Cable Sex Rules  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the name of free speech, the Supreme Court
struck down a federal law that shielded children from sex-oriented
cable TV channels.
</P>
<P>
   By a 5-4 vote Monday, the court said Congress cannot require
cable operators to restrict sexually explicit programming to
overnight hours as a way of minimizing the chance that partially
audible or visible snippets reach children.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, ending a dispute over regulating cable systems
that fail to fully scramble signals for nonsubscribers, was both
hailed as a victory over government censorship and attacked as an
abandonment of impressionable youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're pleased. This decision takes into account the needs of
viewers who want this programming and those who do not. Both can be
accommodated, and cable is committed to making sure such channels
are blocked for viewers who don't want them,'' said Daniel Brenner
of the National Cable Television Association.
</P>
<P>
   But Janet LaRue, an attorney with the Family Research Council,
called the ruling an ''outrage.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a sad day when the protection of children takes a back
seat to the profits of pornographers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The law, part of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, was
bottled up in legal challenges most of the time since its
enactment. It was enforced only from May 1997 to March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   It required cable operators that fail to fully scramble or block
for nonsubscribers such sex-oriented networks as Playboy Television
to make those ''indecent'' channels available only between 10 p.m.
and 6 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike obscene material, indecent material is entitled to
constitutional protection under the First Amendment's freedom of
speech guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   Most cable operators opted for the time restriction because
technology for complete scrambling of signals for nonsubscribers is
prohibitively expensive. As a result, even subscribers could not
receive the sexually explicit programming for most of the day.
</P>
<P>
   The decision untangled the business prospects for sex-oriented
cable TV channels. Playboy Television, Spice and The Hot Network
all cheered the decision, because it struck down restrictions that
prompted some cable systems to choose networks with no
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear, however, how quickly cable systems
that carry these networks would begin showing them outside the 10
p.m. to 6 a.m. time period.
</P>
<P>
   The law's enforcement was suspended when a three-judge federal
court ruled in 1998 that a less restrictive way to protect children
exists -- requiring cable operators to block out any channel for
free when requested to do so by any individual customer. That
requirement is found in another provision of the 1996 law.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court said the three-judge court was correct.
</P>
<P>
   ''If a statute regulates speech based on its content, it must be
narrowly tailored to promote a compelling government interest,''
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote for the court's slender majority.
''If a less restrictive alternative would serve the government's
purpose, the legislature must use that alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ''This case involves speech alone; and even where
speech is indecent and enters the home, the objective of shielding
children does not suffice to support a blanket ban if the
protection can be accomplished by a less restrictive alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   Cable operators that are slow to react to customers' requests
that sex channels be blocked at their homes can be fined or
otherwise penalized, Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Communications Commission Chairman William Kennard said
the decision still leaves parents with the means to protect their
children.
</P>
<P>
   ''Parents should remember that current law specifically provides
that cable customers can contact their local cable companies and
require that channels they find objectionable be blocked from their
homes at no cost,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers had argued that requiring parents to contact
cable operators has not proved effective, and that the so-called
''signal bleed'' problem of not fully scrambled broadcasts persists
in some 39 million homes.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of the complaints federal regulators received over the
years is the Florida woman who said she found her 7- and 8-year-old
children and a playmate one afternoon watching on the Spice channel
scenes of a couple seemingly having sex, with the ''groans and
epithets that go along.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's opinion said, ''A court should not presume parents,
given full information, will fail to act'' and order that such
channels be totally blocked at their home.
</P>
<P>
   He was joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter,
Clarence Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day
O'Connor, Stephen G. Breyer and Antonin Scalia dissented. Writing
for the four, Breyer said the court was wrong in finding an
adequate alternative ''where there are none.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The court reduces Congress' protective power to the vanishing
point,'' Breyer said.

<HEADLINE> Brewers 6, Astros 1, 2nd Game  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- The fans who paid $1 to sit in the bleachers
for a doubleheader at County Stadium got quite a show for their
buck.
</P>
<P>
   The Milwaukee Brewers made the biggest ninth-inning comeback in
their history in the first game of a doubleheader Monday, scoring
seven runs in the ninth before Jose Hernandez's solo homer in the
10th beat the Houston Astros 10-9.
</P>
<P>
   In the second game, Jeromy Burnitz hit a three-run homer and
Jason Bere pitched eight strong innings as the Brewers swept the
twinbill with a 6-1 victory over the reeling Astros, losers of
seven straight.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers did it in front of 3,913 fans, one of the smallest
crowds in County Stadium history.
</P>
<P>
   The first game featured the biggest ninth-inning comeback in the
majors since May 10, 1994, when Atlanta recovered from a seven-run
deficit against Philadelphia before winning in 15 innings. It also
was the seventh time in major league history a team had blown a
lead of seven or more runs in the ninth inning and lost the game.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee finally swept a three-game series with Houston that
began last Tuesday, when the Brewers won a 16-inning contest before
the remaining games were rained out on Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams originally were scheduled for a day off Monday, but
the Astros made a 24-hour stopover on their way home from Montreal,
where they were swept in a three-game series. At 15-28, Houston has
slumped to the NL's worst record.
</P>
<P>
   The makeup doubleheader was announced with just three days
notice, leading to the tiny crowd and cheap ticket prices.
Milwaukee sold bleacher seats for $1, and though the team was
charging $10 for the best seats, fans who paid for any seat were
allowed to move up.
</P>
<P>
   The surging Brewers have won five of six on their nine-game
homestand, scoring 50 runs over those games. Milwaukee is home to
Atlanta for three games this week.
</P>
<P>
   In the second game Monday, Burnitz and Charlie Hayes hit
back-to-back homers off Kip Gross (0-1) in the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Belliard, who has a 12-game hitting streak, added a two-run
double in the fourth, while Bere (3-3) scattered seven hits and
cruised into the eighth inning before allowing a solo homer to Ken
Caminiti.
</P>
<P>
   All the drama was in the first game. Milwaukee was down 9-2
entering the bottom of the ninth before scoring seven runs against
Doug Henry, Jose Cabrera and Billy Wagner, who blew his fourth save
chance of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, who hit his third homer in three days, also had a
two-run double in the ninth inning, while Burnitz's two-run single
with two outs tied the game. In 30 years of baseball, the Brewers
had never come back from more than four runs down in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't remember something quite like that before,'' Hernandez
said. ''On the home run, I just saw a good pitch and hit it. ...
All the hard work was in the comeback.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the largest lead lost by Houston since July 15, 1994, and
the Brewers' biggest comeback in any inning since September 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez hit a one-out pitch from Joe Slusarski (0-2) into the
left-field bleachers. David Weathers (3-1) pitched the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a lot of runs to ask any team to score, especially
against a quality team like that and especially against a closer
like (Wagner),'' Milwaukee manager Davey Lopes said. ''Everybody
will talk about the home run, but that comeback was because of
eight or nine guys getting the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   The ninth began with a walk to Burnitz. Lyle Mouton had a
run-scoring double, followed by a two-run double off Henry by
Hernandez. Marquis Grissom singled in a run against Cabrera,
cutting the lead to 9-6.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner then walked Raul Casanova before striking out James
Mouton and Ron Belliard. But Mark Loretta singled to drive in
Hernandez, and Burnitz's two-run single to right -- his first career
hit against Wagner -- tied the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''As soon as they tied the game, you could just feel the
letdown,'' Houston manager Larry Dierker said. ''I was not
optimistic at that point. ... It's the worst I've seen in 35 years.
It was terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' bullpen collapse wasted seven strong innings from
Shane Reynolds. Houston scored three runs in the eighth and two in
the ninth to build its lead.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hidalgo's three-run homer in the third inning scored
Craig Biggio and Jeff Bagwell. It came off Steve Woodard, who in
his previous start stopped his 16-game winless streak. Woodard
hasn't won at County Stadium since July 16.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Reynolds also didn't get a decision last Tuesday, when the
Brewers beat the Astros in 16 innings. In winning Monday, Milwaukee
clinched its second straight series win for the first time this
year. ... Woodard was scheduled to start one of the games against
Houston that was rained out last week. He hadn't started a game
since May 11, though he struck out one batter in a relief
appearance at Pittsburgh on May 14.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jim Todd, who served as the Los Angeles
Clippers' interim head coach for the final 37 games of last season,
has been removed as a candidate for the team's head coaching job.
</P>
<P>
   Elgin Baylor, the team's vice president of basketball
operations, met with Todd on Monday to inform him of the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor said the Clippers hope to have a coach in place by the
NBA draft on June 28, and confirmed the team has spoken with Mike
Fratello, who coached the Atlanta Hawks for seven seasons and the
Cleveland Cavaliers for six.
</P>
<P>
   Fratello, 53, was fired by the Cavaliers last June 1, following
the lockout-shortened 1998-99 season, and has worked as a
television analyst this season. His teams have a 582-465 record.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor would not identify others he has spoken with about the
job, but did say there have been conversations, and didn't rule out
assistant coach Dennis Johnson as a candidate. Johnson joined the
Clippers' staff on Feb. 4 -- a day after Chris Ford was fired and
Todd was elevated from his assistant coaching position to interim
head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've had several conversations with people, I've talked to
agents about their clients, I intend to talk to a couple of
candidates this week,'' Baylor said. ''I'm not going to get into
who's a candidate or who's not a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Of Todd, Baylor said: ''We appreciate his effort and hard work,
and we have let him know that he is entitled to be considered for a
position on the staff, based on the wishes of the new head coach.
He was very professional about it. he was very receptive. He wants
to be an assistant, he feels his best situation with any
organization is on the bench. He's a coach. He would like to be
here, or an assistant somewhere. That would be up to the head
coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd, 47, joined the organization as an assistant under Ford
before the 1998-99 season. The Clippers were 11-34 before Ford was
fired and 4-33 under Todd for an overall record of 15-67 -- worst in
the NBA.

<HEADLINE> Brewers Sweep Astros in Twinbill  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- The fans who paid $1 to sit in the bleachers
for a doubleheader at County Stadium got quite a show for their
buck.
</P>
<P>
   The Milwaukee Brewers made the biggest ninth-inning comeback in
their history in the first game of a doubleheader Monday, scoring
seven runs in the ninth before Jose Hernandez's solo homer in the
10th beat the Houston Astros 10-9.
</P>
<P>
   In the second game, Jeromy Burnitz hit a three-run homer and
Jason Bere pitched eight strong innings as the Brewers swept the
twinbill with a 6-1 victory over the reeling Astros, losers of
seven straight.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers did it in front of 3,913 fans, one of the smallest
crowds in County Stadium history.
</P>
<P>
   The first game featured the biggest ninth-inning comeback in the
majors since May 10, 1994, when Atlanta recovered from a seven-run
deficit against Philadelphia before winning in 15 innings. It also
was the seventh time in major league history a team had blown a
lead of seven or more runs in the ninth inning and lost the game.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee finally swept a three-game series with Houston that
began last Tuesday, when the Brewers won a 16-inning contest before
the remaining games were rained out on Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams originally were scheduled for a day off Monday, but
the Astros made a 24-hour stopover on their way home from Montreal,
where they were swept in a three-game series. At 15-28, Houston has
slumped to the NL's worst record.
</P>
<P>
   The makeup doubleheader was announced with just three days
notice, leading to the tiny crowd and cheap ticket prices.
Milwaukee sold bleacher seats for $1, and though the team was
charging $10 for the best seats, fans who paid for any seat were
allowed to move up.
</P>
<P>
   The surging Brewers have won five of six on their nine-game
homestand, scoring 50 runs over those games. Milwaukee is home to
Atlanta for three games this week.
</P>
<P>
   In the second game Monday, Burnitz and Charlie Hayes hit
back-to-back homers off Kip Gross (0-1) in the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Belliard, who has a 12-game hitting streak, added a two-run
double in the fourth, while Bere (3-3) scattered seven hits and
cruised into the eighth inning before allowing a solo homer to Ken
Caminiti.
</P>
<P>
   All the drama was in the first game. Milwaukee was down 9-2
entering the bottom of the ninth before scoring seven runs against
Doug Henry, Jose Cabrera and Billy Wagner, who blew his fourth save
chance of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, who hit his third homer in three days, also had a
two-run double in the ninth inning, while Burnitz's two-run single
with two outs tied the game. In 30 years of baseball, the Brewers
had never come back from more than four runs down in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't remember something quite like that before,'' Hernandez
said. ''On the home run, I just saw a good pitch and hit it. ...
All the hard work was in the comeback.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the largest lead lost by Houston since July 15, 1994, and
the Brewers' biggest comeback in any inning since September 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez hit a one-out pitch from Joe Slusarski (0-2) into the
left-field bleachers. David Weathers (3-1) pitched the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a lot of runs to ask any team to score, especially
against a quality team like that and especially against a closer
like (Wagner),'' Milwaukee manager Davey Lopes said. ''Everybody
will talk about the home run, but that comeback was because of
eight or nine guys getting the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   The ninth began with a walk to Burnitz. Lyle Mouton had a
run-scoring double, followed by a two-run double off Henry by
Hernandez. Marquis Grissom singled in a run against Cabrera,
cutting the lead to 9-6.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner then walked Raul Casanova before striking out James
Mouton and Ron Belliard. But Mark Loretta singled to drive in
Hernandez, and Burnitz's two-run single to right -- his first career
hit against Wagner -- tied the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''As soon as they tied the game, you could just feel the
letdown,'' Houston manager Larry Dierker said. ''I was not
optimistic at that point. ... It's the worst I've seen in 35 years.
It was terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' bullpen collapse wasted seven strong innings from
Shane Reynolds. Houston scored three runs in the eighth and two in
the ninth to build its lead.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hidalgo's three-run homer in the third inning scored
Craig Biggio and Jeff Bagwell. It came off Steve Woodard, who in
his previous start stopped his 16-game winless streak. Woodard
hasn't won at County Stadium since July 16.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Reynolds also didn't get a decision last Tuesday, when the
Brewers beat the Astros in 16 innings. In winning Monday, Milwaukee
clinched its second straight series win for the first time this
year. ... Woodard was scheduled to start one of the games against
Houston that was rained out last week. He hadn't started a game
since May 11, though he struck out one batter in a relief
appearance at Pittsburgh on May 14.

<HEADLINE> Six partners with Pyramid Cos. sue Robert Congel  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Six partners of mall magnate Robert Congel
are accusing the Pyramid Cos. founder of defrauding them of more
than $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit filed in federal court Monday, the plaintiffs
allege that Congel shifted funds between mall partnerships without
the authority to do so, said attorney Michael Endler.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the Pyramid Cos. malls are owned by different investors
who have partnered with Congel, Endler said. The plaintiffs are
partners in 10 of the Pyramid malls in New York and Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ''For a number of years, Bob Congel and a close-knit group of
insiders have essentially been operating all of these partnerships
as if they were sole owners,'' Endler said. The plaintiffs believe
that the shifting of funds was not authorized in their agreements
and was done in a manner to defraud the partners, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from Pyramid Cos., said the allegations are false and
were made by partners who were upset when various Pyramid
properties failed to be sold two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''We learned about the filing of this action late in the
afternoon. It was brought about by a handful of partners who have
become inactive in the affairs of their partnerships over the past
several years,'' Pyramid Cos., officials said in a written
statement. ''Collectively they owe their partners a great deal of
money.''
</P>
<P>
   The partners suing Congel are John Bersani of Weston, Ma., John
Charters of Needham, Ma., Daniel Lugosch III of Dover, Ma., Peter
Steingraber of Boston, Edward Kellogg of Poughkeepsie, and Robert
Ungerer of Loudonville, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Pyramid Cos., based in Syracuse, owns two dozen malls in New
York, Massachusetts and Vermont. Congel recently announced plans to
triple the size of the Carousel Center in Syracuse and make it the
largest mall in the country.

<HEADLINE> Assembly panel approves new funding for charter schools  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY PARELLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- State lawmakers took a first step Monday
toward fixing inequities in the way charter schools are funded.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly Education Committee passed a bill that would
provide about $10 million more in state aid to fund charter
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The state also would have to do a speedier evaluation of these
experimental schools to resolve broader -- and more expensive --
issues, under the measure, A-1344.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Richard Bagger, R-Union, agreed to hold the most
costly provision of the original version of the bill -- a phase-out
of state funding to districts that lose students to charter
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than grapple with that issue, which would eventually cost
the state an estimated $37 million, Bagger said he wanted to
quickly address two funding inequities that have emerged recently.
</P>
<P>
   The first is due to a recent ruling from the New Jersey Council
on Local Mandates, which reviews state laws to make sure they do
not put a financial strain on districts and local government.
</P>
<P>
   That ruling struck down state regulations that said districts
must give charter schools 90 percent of what they actually spend on
education.
</P>
<P>
   Under previous state rules, districts could send charter schools
90 percent of what the state says it costs to provide a ''thorough
and efficient education,'' or what a district actually spends --
whichever was lower. The ''T&AMP;E'' amount is usually much lower than
real costs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the state changed that and said districts must pay the
full cost. The council last week said the state can't force
districts to pay the higher amount.
</P>
<P>
   That would have meant a $6 million loss to charter schools, with
cuts ranging from $32 per pupil at the Oceanside Charter School in
Atlantic City to about $3,600 per student at the Red Bank Charter
School in Monmouth County, according to state figures.
</P>
<P>
   That would have crippled some schools, said Sarah Tantillo,
executive director of the New Jersey Charter Public Schools
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Under Bagger's bill, the state would make up the difference
between the T&AMP;E amount and the real costs.
</P>
<P>
   The second fix would funnel $3.8 million through districts to
charter schools for students who transfer from private and
parochial schools, another district or a home-schooled setting into
charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, those students are not counted in their
enrollments and so districts do not receive state aid for them.
</P>
<P>
   But, once they transfer into a charter school, a district
actually loses aid for students it never educated -- or got state
money for.
</P>
<P>
   That problem corrects itself in the second year because once the
students are in charter schools, they are counted and the state
provides aid for them.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would provide money for that first year of lost
funding.
</P>
<P>
   The original version of the legislation would have added a
phase-out provision to charter school funding.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the funding follows the student. So, when a district
loses a child to a charter school, it also loses the state aid for
that student all at once.
</P>
<P>
   Bagger's initial proposal would have phased out that aid, with
the state paying both the charter school and the district for a
portion of students' education in the first three years that the
student transfers.
</P>
<P>
   Districts officials maintain that even though they are no longer
teaching those students who transfer to charter schools, their
costs don't decrease right away.
</P>
<P>
   It takes losing a lot of students, rather than a handful, to
reach an economy of scale where they can consolidate classrooms and
fire teachers.
</P>
<P>
   But Bagger said when he learned the provision would cost an
estimated $37 million in the 2002-2003 school year, he was shocked.
</P>
<P>
   So he decided the issue should be addressed in the evaluation,
which would be due Feb. 1, 2001, rather than Jan. 2002, under the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Education Commissioner David Hespe objected to the shortened
time frame for the evaluation, which would reveal how well charter
schools are performing and what impact they are having on
traditional schools.
</P>
<P>
   He said he needs more time to gather the relevant information.
Bagger said he would work with the department on the timing of the
study.
</P>
<P>
   Charter schools were created by the Legislature in 1995 to give
parents a free alternative if they are dissatisfied with their
district's public schools. Charter schools operate with public
funds, but outside many of the rules that govern traditional
schools.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey has 46 charter schools that educate about 9,000
students.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Election Climate Said Poor  </HEADLINE>
By RAVI NESSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- An international pro-democracy group
said Monday that conditions for credible elections in Zimbabwe
don't exist because of the widespread political violence and a bias
in favor of the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   At least 23 people -- nearly all opposition supporters -- have
been killed in recent months, leading to worries that many
Zimbabweans opposed to the government will be to frightened to vote
in the parliamentary elections set for June 24 and 25.
</P>
<P>
   ''The violence has created an atmosphere of anxiety and fear,''
said Alex Ekwueme, head of the delegation from the National
Democratic Institute for International Affairs. ''The abilities of
political parties and many candidates, predominantly from the
opposition, to campaign openly and freely do not meet international
standards for fair electoral competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Ekwueme, a former vice president of Nigeria, said Zimbabweans
are afraid their ballots will not be secret and that there will be
postelection retribution against those who vote against the ruling
party.
</P>
<P>
   In its report issued Monday, the institute also criticized the
state media's bias toward the ruling party, the stringent
requirements for public campaign funding that disqualifies all
opposition parties and the opposition's lack of access to important
information, including updated voter rolls and new voting
districts.
</P>
<P>
   ''The conditions for credible, democratic elections do not exist
in Zimbabwe at this time,'' Ekwueme said.
</P>
<P>
   A delegation from the institute, which has monitored elections
in over 50 countries, has been talking to representatives of
political parties and civic organizations across Zimbabwe since May
15.
</P>
<P>
   Violence has spread throughout the country since the ruling
party lost a constitutional referendum in February that would have
strengthened the powers of President Robert Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
   In the elections, the new opposition party the Movement for
Democratic Change is expected to pose the greatest electoral
challenge to the ruling party since Mugabe led Zimbabwe to
independence from Britain in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling party currently controls 147 of the 150 seats in
Parliament. Presidential elections are not scheduled for another
two years.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure the parliamentary elections are held in the best
possible environment, the National Democratic Institute recommended
that political leaders, especially Mugabe, make sure that violence
ends immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The report recommended unfettered access for election observers,
enhanced voter education and improved opposition party access to
television and radio, which are state-run and heavily biased in
favor of the ruling party.

<HEADLINE> Morocco King To Visit Washington  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton plans to host the new king
of Morocco for a state visit in Washington next month, the White
House said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   King Mohammed VI took office last year after the death of his
father, King Hassan II. Clinton attended Hassan's funeral, and has
called him an important figure in Mideast peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The June 20 visit will be the younger king's first official trip
to Washington since taking office.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their meeting will help strengthen the bilateral relations
between the United States and Morocco and provide an opportunity to
exchange views on regional and international issues,'' including
Mideast peace, the White House said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed the ''king of the poor'' by the Moroccan press, the new
king has made social policy one of his priorities in a country
where more than 20 percent of the population is officially
unemployed and about half, mainly women, are illiterate.

<HEADLINE> Bush Rips Clinton on Israel  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush accused the Clinton
administration on Monday of taking sides in last year's Israeli
elections, continuing a pattern of the United States trying ''to
make Israel conform to its own plans and timetables.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Vice President Al Gore, Bush's Democratic rival
for the presidency, called the allegation ''irresponsible and
reckless'' and said it raised questions about Bush's fitness to be
a world leader.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who cited no specifics to support his accusation, said
pressure from the administration on Israel ''is not the path to
peace.'' Instead, the Republican said, the Jewish state should be
supported as it settles its own affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In the national election, the administration was seen as
favoring the eventual winner, Ehud Barak, over then-Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu. Among other things, James Carville, President
Clinton's former political adviser, filled that same role for
Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said the Texas governor also was
upset that Clinton pressed for settlement deadlines during the 1998
Wye River peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   With the talks faltering, Clinton held lengthy meetings with
both sides on Maryland's Eastern Shore. He also joined Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in setting deadlines this year for
a final settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ''America should not interfere in Israel's democratic process,
and America will not interfere in Israeli elections when I am the
president,'' Bush told some 2,000 delegates attending the annual
policy conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''In recent times, Washington has tried to make Israel conform
to its own plans and timetables, but this is not the path to
peace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During his remarks, Bush reiterated his support for moving the
U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ''As soon as I take office, I will begin the process of moving
the U.S. ambassador to the city Israel has chosen as its capital,''
he said to a standing ovation, his only one of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Gore were eager to comment even before the Texas
governor made his statement about Israel's elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's irresponsible and reckless for the governor to make such
a charge involving a region of the world where people ought to be
careful what they're saying,'' said Chris Lehane. ''It really does
raise a question of his readiness to be a leader in international
affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   The speech kicked off a week of defense- and national
security-related activity by the governor. On Tuesday, Bush
scheduled a news conference at the National Press Club on defense
and foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, speaking at a fund-raiser Monday night, said he
would talk about ensuring ''certainty in an uncertain world'' -- a
phrase he has used when speaking about strengthing the U.S.
military and about making foreign policy priorities so the armed
forces aren't overly deployed.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was introduced by his sister, Doro, at the event, expected
to raise $350,000 to $400,000. And he was surprised by his father,
former President Bush, who snuck into a private reception to shake
his son's hand and pose for a photo. The president happened to be
staying in the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has been criticized as inexperienced in foreign
affairs, had also been scheduled to meet with Barak on Tuesday, but
the prime minister canceled his trip after violence flared on
Israel's West Bank and in South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Bush has met with Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo and Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov. On Thursday, he
is to meet in Austin, Texas, with the president of South Africa,
Thabo Mbeki. Mbeki met with Gore on Monday in Washington before
attending a state dinner with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1951, AIPAC is a Jewish lobbying group dedicated to
support for Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The group is a potent political fund-raiser, and presidential
and congressional candidates often pay heed to its desires. Gore
was to address the group on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Barak had been scheduled to deliver the keynote address Monday
night before he canceled. Instead he spoke by satellite to a
luncheon and praised AIPAC's support for Israel.

<HEADLINE> Harding: I Still Love Ex-Boyfriend  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM McCALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Fresh out of jail for throwing a hubcap at
her boyfriend and punching him, Tonya Harding says she still loves
him and wants to get back together -- a prospect he may avoid.
</P>
<P>
   The former champion figure skater was released Sunday from jail
in neighboring Clark County, Wash., after serving three days for
her conviction on a disorderly conduct charge.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Harding is to begin 10 days of community service --
also part of her sentence -- by showing up at Camas Cemetery to help
work crews do some sprucing up for Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
   Harding will be performing other kinds of community service as
well, according to the police department in Camas, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Harding, 29, pleaded guilty last Thursday in Camas-Washougal
Municipal Court to hurling a hubcap at her boyfriend's head and
then punching him in the face last February.
</P>
<P>
   In some brief remarks released by her manager, Harding said her
conviction and her jail time had been ''a very stressful experience
for everyone involved.''
</P>
<P>
   She repeated an apology to her family and friends, and to her
boyfriend, Darren Silver.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want you all to know that I still love Darren very much,''
Harding said.
</P>
<P>
   But Silver, 28, didn't seem to be in a forgiving mood.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the tabloid TV show ''Inside Edition,''
Silver said Harding had attacked him after they'd been drinking.
</P>
<P>
   ''She blindsided me out of the blue,'' said Silver.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was in shock. She hurt my pride more than my face,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Silver said he wished her well: ''I just want her to be
happy and not harmed.''
</P>
<P>
   Harding's manager, Linda Lewis, said she had received more than
1,000 e-mail messages of support for Harding since the conviction
last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Figure Skating Association banned Harding for life and
stripped her of the national title she won in 1994 after Harding's
ex-husband carried out a plot to injure rival skater Nancy Kerrigan
at the U.S. championship in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Harding pleaded guilty in 1994 to Oregon charges of hindering
prosecution but avoided jail time. She was fined $110,000 and
ordered to perform 500 hours of community service.

John Fitzgerald:
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- John Fitzgerald, the former Las Vegas Hilton
president who played a key role in the transformation of the city's
gambling industry, died Sunday after a long illness. He was 71.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald took the helm of the hotel in 1972 after it was
purchased by hotel magnate Barron Hilton. The hotel was originally
the International Hotel and was at one time the largest in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald worked for Hilton in New York and Beverly Hills,
Calif. He instituted stringent cost controls and vigorous marketing
efforts aimed at conventioneers.
</P>
<P>
   The Las Vegas Hilton became known as a destination for high
rollers and a major convention hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald also served as president of the Nevada Resort
Association and was a member of the Las Vegas Convention and
Visitors Authority's board of directors.
Roy Jackson:
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Roy Jackson, a former executive director of the
International North Pacific Fisheries Commission and deputy
director of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization,
died Thursday of a burst aortic aneurysm. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was a leading force in restoring sockeye and pink salmon
runs throughout the Fraser River system in British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   From 1938 to 1955 he worked for the International Pacific Salmon
Fisheries Commission, which regulated the Canadian and U.S. catch
of salmon from the Fraser. In his last five years with the agency
he was chief engineer and assistant director.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955 he became executive director of the newly formed North
Pacific commission, which included Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964 he moved to Rome to direct worldwide fisheries
activities for the United Nations, and eight years later took the
No. 2 job in the Food and Agricultural Organization.
William Dale Jennings:
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- William Dale Jennings, a pioneering gay
activist who co-founded the first major homosexual rights
organization in the United States, died May 11 of respiratory
failure. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings wrote ''The Cowboys,'' a novel later made into a movie
starring John Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings helped found the Mattachine Society in the early 1950s
after he was charged with indecent behavior in a park. He was
acquitted by a jury in what was seen as a rebuke of police tactics
that entrapped homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Mattachine Society dissolved a few years later, it
helped create the foundation for other homosexual rights
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings also co-founded ONE Magazine, the nation's first gay
publication. The postmaster began confiscating the magazine in
1954, contending it was obscene. It led to a landmark lawsuit that
culminated in a 1958 Supreme Court ruling that a publication
dedicated to homosexual equality was not obscene.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings also wrote two other novels, ''The Ronin'' and ''The
Sinking of the Sarah Diamond.''
Loyd Jowers:
</P>
<P>
   UNION CITY, Tenn. (AP) -- Loyd Jowers, the former Memphis cafe
owner who claimed he hired someone other than James Earl Ray to
assassinate Martin Luther King Jr., died Saturday of lung cancer.
He was 73.
</P>
<P>
   Jowers ran Jim's Grill, a cafe on the ground floor of a rooming
house from which prosecutors say the shot that killed King was
fired on April 4, 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Ray confessed to the killing in 1969 but recanted and spent the
rest of his life trying to prove his innocence. He died in prison
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In an ABC-TV interview in 1993, Jowers said he received $100,000
from late Memphis produce merchant Frank Liberto to arrange King's
murder. He claimed he hired the assassin, but said it wasn't Ray.
</P>
<P>
   Jowers and ''unknown conspirators'' were found liable in
December in a wrongful death lawsuit brought against Jowers by the
slain civil rights leader's family.
</P>
<P>
   The jury awarded the Kings just $100 in damages, but the family
had asked only for a token amount because what they wanted most was
for the jury to find evidence of a conspiracy in an effort to call
for a new investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Jowers was sick for much of the trial and did not testify.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby County prosecutor John Campbell, who has investigated the
assassination, has said Jowers' claims had no merit.
</P>
<P>
   A House committee concluded in 1978 that Ray killed King but may
have had help from a small group of racists before or after the
murder. The committee found no government involvement.
Gary Osborn:
</P>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Gary Osborn, the women's track and cross
country coach at Drake University and a member of the school's
coaching staff for 32 years, died Sunday of a heart attack. He was
56.
</P>
<P>
   He had been the longest-serving track coach in the Missouri
Valley Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Osborn became an assistant coach at the school after graduating
in 1968. He was hired as women's cross country coach in 1989 and
was appointed women's track coach in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   His cross country teams won Missouri Valley Conference
championships in 1994, 1995 and 1998. He was the league's coach of
the year three times and was Gateway Conference coach of the year
in 1989.

<HEADLINE> Republicans back bill to bar census sampling in redistricting  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Choosing between actual enumeration and
statistical sampling might sound like a high school word problem,
but both sides say how census data are used when drawing
legislative districts will affect residents across the state.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Assembly's State Government Committee voted along
party lines, 3-2, to move a bill that would force the New Jersey
Apportionment Commission to use the actual count and disregard any
estimate.
</P>
<P>
   When the once-a-decade results are in, the commission is
required to use the numbers from the U.S. Census Bureau to draw
boundaries for state and federal representatives.
</P>
<P>
   However, the federal government will provide the state with two
figures: the actual head count of residents who answered the census
and an estimate based on that data and statistical models.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Republicans want the commission to only use the head
count, or actual enumeration.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and other opponents say to do that will undercut the
number of minorities, recent immigrants and city residents who
appear not likely to respond to the census. The only fair way, they
argue, is to use the statistical sample. They claim it presents a
more accurate picture of the state's population.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that sampling-enhanced numbers
cannot be used in congressional apportionment, the process by which
the House of Representative's 435 seats are distributed among the
states. Left unspecified was whether sample-adjusted numbers could
be used to allocate federal funds or to draw political boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   States will have the option of using either adjusted or raw
census data to redraw congressional and state legislative district
boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Bill sponsor, Assemblyman Michael P. Carroll, R-Morris, said New
Jersey's small towns and cities make it easier for census workers
to actually count residents. Using estimates would force the
redistricting commission to guess where people are living, Carroll
argued.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you don't know where they are, you can't draw district
lines to include them,'' Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Where do you put these people if you have no clue where they
are,'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll and other supporters said the state would be free to use
estimates when applying for federal funding.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted criticism from U.S. Rep. Frank Pallone, D-Long
Branch, who said the bill would limit the opportunity for
minorities and others in cities to be represented in government.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that what you're saying is that the right to vote is
less important than the money,'' Pallone said.
</P>
<P>
   Pallone said the only proven formula for an accurate count of
the population is to incorporate the statistical sample.
Republicans in Congress deny that, in part, so the number of
minorities will not be accurately reflected in urban districts, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we're really talking about here is ultimately
discrimination,'' Pallone said. But he told the Assembly panel that
he did not think such politics played a role in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Nicholas Asselta, R-Cumberland, said the issue is
similar to voter turnout in elections. Elected officials complain
that more people should vote so more can take part in the process,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   For minorities and others not likely to be counted, the message
should be to participate, Asselta said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you want to stand up, stand up and fill out the census
form,'' Asselta said.

<HEADLINE> Investigation of deadly pier collapse delayed  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL RUBINKAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- An engineering firm hired by the city to
investigate last week's deadly pier collapse will be replaced
because it previously performed work on the pier, the city said.
</P>
<P>
   S.T. Hudson Engineers Inc. of Camden, N.J., was supposed to
begin inspecting the wreckage Monday but disclosed that it had a
potential conflict of interest, said city spokeswoman Barbara
Grant.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have decided to go with another firm,'' she said. ''With
the case still under investigation, what we're trying to avoid is
any appearance of impropriety with them having worked on the pier
before.''
</P>
<P>
   The city replaced Hudson with Urban Engineers Inc. of
Philadelphia, and Hudson met with Urban to turn over its files on
the case. Hudson executives did not return calls for comment
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Three people were killed and another 37 injured Thursday night
when the pier supporting the new nightclub Heat crashed into the
Delaware River. Two people remained unaccounted for, but police
said they have not received any missing persons reports from people
claiming their loved ones were at the club.
</P>
<P>
   Killed were DeAnn White, 25, of Philadelphia; Jean Ferraro, 27,
of Cherry Hill, N.J.; and Monica Rodriguez, 21, also of Cherry
Hill. All were employees at the New Jersey State Aquarium in
Camden.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro's funeral is scheduled for Tuesday and Rodriguez is to
be buried Wednesday. Funeral arrangements for White remained
incomplete. The aquarium is planning a small, private memorial
service for the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Under rainy skies Monday, investigators from the police crime
scene unit and the Licenses and Inspections Department continued to
comb through the wreckage as a crane hoisted large chunks of wood
from the cool, murky water. Debris is being taken to Fort Mifflin
for analysis.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, an attorney for one of the owners tried to gain
access to the scene but was turned away.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Shawn Dougherty of the police Marine Unit said police
divers won't be going into the water anytime soon because more of
the pier could tumble into the river at any time. ''That's how
insecure it is,'' Dougherty said.
</P>
<P>
   Underwater cameras have already documented chairs, potted
plants, refrigerators, fuel lines and other items from the club.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, the Philadelphia Daily News, quoting police
sources, reported that the operators of Pier 34 knew about its
structural problems for at least eight years. Police searched for
evidence in the offices of Eli Karetny, the nightclub's owner.
</P>
<P>
   Karetny did not return a call for comment Monday. The office of
his lawyer, Robert Lane, referred calls to a partner at his firm,
who did not immediately return a call.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the pier, real estate developer Michael Asbell,
said his lawyers advised him not to comment on the investigation
but called the media reports ''outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're sick and saddened'' about the deaths. ''I can't tell you
how terrible we feel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's an ongoing investigation. We're cooperating with all
the agencies. Pending this investigation, we're not at liberty to
talk about it,'' Asbell said.

<HEADLINE> Va. Commonwealth 4, Tennessee 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. (AP) -- Unseeded Virginia Commonwealth and perennial
champion Stanford advanced to the finals of the NCAA men's tennis
championships Monday, eliminating two Southeastern Conference
schools.
</P>
<P>
   VCU trailed Tennessee 4-3, but won when two Volunteers players
retired with cramps.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford shut out Florida 4-0, but was forced to three sets in
every singles match except one.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's finals matchup includes VCU (27-4), a team that had
never advanced beyond the round of 16, and Stanford (27-1), a team
that has won 16 team championships, including 12 of the last 15.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee (23-6) led 3-2 when both Paul Podbury at No. 4 singles
and Peter Handoyo at No. 3 singles were forced to default within
minutes of each other, giving VCU (27-4) the 4-3 win.
</P>
<P>
   Podbury led Fernando Sanchez 7-5, 4-4 in a lengthy match at No.
4. Both players exchanged defensive groundstrokes and a few harsh
words. Sanchez lost the first set when he was called for two code
violations.
</P>
<P>
   Podbury could not serve in the ninth game of the second set and
retired, tying the team score 3-3, and shifting the attention to
the Jose Sanchez-Handoyo match.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at No. 3, Handoyo and Jose Sanchez were both showing
the signs of dehydration. After the eighth game of the third set,
Sanchez asked for a five-minute injury timeout so that ice bags
could be applied to his thighs. Between points, their coaches
rushed onto the court with water.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez double-faulted twice in the ninth game, but fought off a
break point, after which Handoyo requested an injury timeout in the
middle of a game. After the timeout, Sanchez held his serve to go
up 4-6, 6-1, 4-5.
</P>
<P>
   Handoyo used his full 90-second allotment during the crossover
to walk to the other end of the court. When he fell to his knees,
Tennessee coach Michael Fancutt signaled that Handoyo was retiring,
setting off a jubilant reaction from VCU.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was an ugly way to win,'' VCU coach Paul Kostin coach.
''I've never seen anything like it, and I have been coaching a few
years. You don't want to win it that way. It was a good match. It
was a shame it had to come down to a couple of defaults. It was not
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Fancutt also spoke of the unusual nature of the matches.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was a hard way to lose,'' Fancutt said. ''Normally that
is not a hard decision when you see one of your guys struggling.
But both guys were pretty close to defaulting. Pete might have been
one shot away from winning. But when he couldn't even move, you
can't watch a guy you have worked with for two years not be able to
move.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sure, it was difficult, because for the past three years we
have worked to get to where we are and to get to the finals.''
</P>
<P>
   Kostin said he never considered pulling Jose Sanchez from his
match.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a strong kid,'' Kostin said. ''If we're going down, we're
going down fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee won the doubles point and got wins from Adam Carey at
No. 2 and from Mark Fitzpatrick at No. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Commonwealth won with Daniel Andersson at No. 1 and
Mats Norin at No. 5. Andersson, the nation's second-ranked player,
beat Mark Parsons 6-2, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Florida relied on its doubles and a strong 1-2 punch with the
nation's top-ranked player Jeff Morrison at No. 1 singles and
10th-ranked Justin O'Neal at No. 2. But Stanford won the doubles,
and Cardinal ace Alex Kim, ranked seventh, defeated Morrison 6-3,
7-5, ending a 14-match win streak.
</P>
<P>
   ''Florida is flat-out a great team,'' Stanford coach Dick Gould
said. ''It took a great competitive effort on our part to get by
them. If we played them 10 times, Florida would win five times.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Florida forced a third set in five of six singles
matches, the Gators could not score a point. Stanford's K.J.
Hippensteel won at No. 3, and Scotty Scott clinched the match at
No. 5 with a 3-6, 6-3, 6-1 win over Dylan Mann.

<HEADLINE> Officer Testifies Vs Terror Suspect  </HEADLINE>
By JAMAL HALA
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- A man on trial for allegedly planning
terrorist attacks during the New Year was compiling information on
Israeli diplomats and Jordanian officials and businessmen, a police
officer testified Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Khader Abu Hosher is one of 28 men accused of being linked with
Saudi fugitive Osama bin Laden, who is wanted in the United States
for the 1998 bombing of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that
killed 224 people.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanian officials say the 28 accused Arabs, many of whom are
Jordanians of Palestinian descent, planned bomb attacks on U.S. and
Israeli tourists during millennium celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Mohammad Aramsheh told a state court Monday that a document
he seized from Abu Hosher's Amman office ''contained a list of
addresses of leading Jordanian authorities such as judicial,
military, security and managers of banks and hotels.''
</P>
<P>
   Aramsheh said he also seized a paper from Abu Hosher's office on
which was written: ''The first secretary of the Jewish Embassy
resides in Amra Hotel, the 21st floor, room 24.'' He did not
identify the diplomat by name.
</P>
<P>
   The police officer told the three-man tribunal the information
he seized was hidden inside a photocopier along with stamps of the
Syrian and Jordanian governments, the Palestine Liberation
Organization and its military intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Other material seized included expired American, Dutch, Iraqi,
Kuwaiti, Lebanese and Jordanian passports, identification cards
from Arab countries and maps of tourist sites in Jordan, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The trial, which opened April 20, involves 13 suspects who are
at large and 15 who have been in custody since December. The 15 --
13 Jordanians of Palestinian descent, an Iraqi and an Algerian --
have pleaded innocent.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants have been charged with various counts, including
possession of explosives and affiliation with ''an outlawed group''
involved in a ''conspiracy to carry out terrorist attacks'' in
Jordan.

<HEADLINE> Chavez Vows To Focus on Economy  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN GUTKIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Expressing confidence he will be
re-elected, President Hugo Chavez promised Monday to concentrate on
rescuing Venezuela's faltering economy and move away from the
political confrontation that characterized his first 15 months in
office.
</P>
<P>
   In a nationally televised speech Monday night outlining his
vision for his next six years in office, Chavez said his
''revolution'' has served as an escape valve for popular
frustrations that have been building up for years.
</P>
<P>
   He said that now that his movement has decimated the old
political order, the country should ''leave behind the explosive
phases'' of the revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are obliged to build on top of the ruins that we have
inherited as a country,'' he told a crowd gathered a hotel in
downtown Caracas.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuelans vote Sunday in national elections required by a new
constitution pushed through by Chavez last year that calls for most
public offices, including the presidency, to be ''re-legitimized''
through new balloting.
</P>
<P>
   The constitution extended presidential terms from five to six
years and introduced immediate re-election for the first time --
giving Chavez the possibility of ruling for another 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Most polls show the president with a 15- to 20-point lead over
his closest challenger, former Zulia state governor Francisco Arias
Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez and Arias led a failed 1992 coup attempt together, but
Arias has broken away from the president, saying he has betrayed
the original goals of their rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's opponents say he has spent too much time consolidating
power instead of dealing with the economy, which shrank by seven
percent last year despite a boom in international oil prices. They
say Chavez's constant verbal attacks on opposition politicians,
businessmen and Catholic church leaders have created a hostile
climate for investment.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez spent much of his speech Monday night explaining why his
government's economic policies are sensible, saying he was going to
personally command the economy's recovery and insisting he was not
opposed to private capital as his critics have claimed.
</P>
<P>
   But he reiterated that economic growth must be accompanied by
more equitable distribution of wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Despite last year's precipitous economic decline, there are
signs of a mild recovery with the central bank announcing last week
that the economy grew by a modest three-tenths of a percent in the
year's first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez also said he was committed to the democratic rule of law.
In the same breath, however, he offered Libya as a model for such a
democracy because of Moammar Gadhafi's use of ''popular assemblies
all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   The president has been criticized for what his opponents say is
his sacrificing of good relations with the United States and
Colombia -- Venezuela's main trading partners -- in favor of boosting
ties to Cuba, China and Middle Eastern oil producing nations.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, two Venezuelan civil rights groups formally asked the
country's highest court to postpone the May 28 vote because of
confusion and technical difficulties in the electoral process. The
petition comes just days after the head of the Organization of
American States observation team in Venezuela expressed concern
that computer glitches could create problems during the elections.

Clinton: Disbarment Recommendation Wrong
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- President Clinton today decried an Arkansas Supreme
Court panel's recommendation that he should be disbarred over ''serious
misconduct'' in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case. He told ''NBC Nightly
News'' the panel responded too harshly to his testimony on Monica Lewinsky,
which he has labeled as ''legally accurate.'' Clinton attorney David Kendall
said of the recommendation: ''We will vigorously dispute it in a court of law.''
If a Little Rock judge now decides to disbar Clinton, the president can appeal

   HOUSTON (AP) -- The admitted railroad killer who made the FBI's 10 Most
Wanted List was sentenced today to death for killing a Houston-area doctor, one
of nine murders he was accused of committing. The jury that convicted Angel
Maturino Resendiz last week met for just less than two hours before deciding on
the death sentence. It could have sentenced the Mexican drifter to life in
prison. He had asked for the death penalty.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As Israel's security belt inside southern Lebanon
collapsed Monday, Prime Minister Ehud Barak sought the help of the United States
and the United Nations for a peaceful pullout of Israeli troops. Israeli-allied
militiamen, who helped maintain the security zone for 22 years, fled toward
Israel's border. Hundreds of Lebanese civilians rushed forward to fill the
vacuum. Barak said he would hold Syria and Lebanon accountable if the Israeli
withdrawal was marked by violence.

   MIAMI (AP) -- The man photographed holding Elian Gonzalez during the armed

government officials, saying his constitutional rights were violated. The
federal lawsuit filed by Donato Dalrymple seeks damages in excess of $100
million. ''The complaint alleges unnecessary and excessive physical force,''
said Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, a conservative group that is
providing legal representation for Dalrymple. Dalrymple helped to rescue Elian

Court Ousts Cable TV Sex Rules

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the name of free speech, the Supreme Court struck down
a federal law that shielded children from sex-oriented cable TV channels. By a
5-4 vote, the court said Congress cannot require cable operators to restrict
sexually explicit programming to overnight hours as a way of minimizing the
chance that partially audible or visible snippets reach children. The decision
ended a dispute over regulating cable systems that fail to fully scramble

<HEADLINE> Chaotic Count, Fraud Mar Haiti Vote  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE FAUL
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Poring through mounds of ballots,
Haitian officials struggled Monday to tabulate the results of
legislative and local elections supposed to set the nation back on
the road to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   While Sunday's election was marked by relative peace, the chaos
surrounding Monday's vote count was ''most unfortunate,'' said
Ambassador Orlando Marville of the Organization of American States,
supervisor of more than 200 foreign observers.
</P>
<P>
   Three people have been killed. On Sunday, a police officer was
slain by a supporter of a candidate and the suspect was shot to
death by police. On Monday an opposition candidate was stoned to
death during a clash with supporters of former President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
</P>
<P>
   Officials warned that a disorganized and prolonged count would
be vulnerable to tampering.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Lavalas Family party of Aristide claimed victory,
though no results had been announced. Hundreds of militants poured
into the streets to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition parties charged in a joint statement that ''an
electoral coup'' was in the works to give a landslide victory to
Lavalas and Aristide, who is favored to win presidential elections
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Bickering over fraud in the 1997 election led to a feud between
Parliament and President Rene Preval, who is allied with Aristide.
Preval disbanded Parliament in 1999 and ruled by decree -- creating
an unconstitutional government that Sunday's vote was supposed to
fix.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and United Nations both urged Haiti to hold
the elections, and foreign creditors suspended $500 million in aid
until the Caribbean nation re-established a constitutional
government.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday's harried vote-counting cast doubt on the election's
credibility. Opposition politicians claimed Aristide loyalists had
controlled polling stations and expelled opposition observers.
</P>
<P>
   Some polling stations opened late Sunday, and hundreds never
opened -- which the opposition claimed was the result of a
deliberate attempt to discourage its supporters from voting.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will not accept the results of these elections without an
evaluation'' by national and international observers, said Evans
Paul, spokesman for the five-party Space for Concord coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Riot police fired tear gas Monday to disperse a few dozen
opposition supporters protesting alleged vote-rigging. After the
police left, hundreds of Aristide militants chased the
demonstrators with a storm of stones. Jean-Michel Olophene, who was
running for Port-au-Prince's local consultative assembly, was found
dead afterward, his head smashed in by stones.
</P>
<P>
   Lavalas spokesman Yvon Neptune, a senate candidate, said the
accusations of vote-rigging came from ''a group of politicians with
no roots among the people.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Port-au-Prince tabulation center, four officials sat atop
piles of votes 2 feet high, trying Monday to collate tally sheets.
About 29,490 candidates had contested 7,625 posts in the
legislature, mayoral commissions, and local and rural councils.
Runoffs were scheduled for June 25.
</P>
<P>
   Head of the center, Rose Delaunay, said that election officials
without transportation had to carry ballot boxes on their heads in
a rainstorm for up to a mile Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Ballots and ballot boxes were ''strewn all over the streets at 3
a.m.,'' said Jean-Paul Poirier, a Canadian consultant to the
electoral council who organized an effort to save materials in
several areas. It wasn't clear whether the ballots were
intentionally dumped by people trying to thwart the election or
unintentionally by election workers.
</P>
<P>
   In suburban Delmas, hundreds of boxes were piled up in disorder,
and final tally sheets were scattered across a courtyard.

<HEADLINE> Barkley Bored By ''Hack-a-Shaq''  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Charles Barkley's reaction to Portland's
''Hack-a-Shaq'' strategy in Game 1 of the Western Conference finals
was similar to most basketball fans -- it's boring to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no problem with them doing that at the end of the
game,'' Barkley said before the Trail Blazers and Los Angeles
Lakers met in Game 2 of the best-of-seven series Monday night.
''But to start it with so much time left?''
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers trailed 86-74 when they first fouled O'Neal
intentionally with 5:27 remaining in Game 1 on Saturday, and O'Neal
made 12-of-24 free throws after that in winning 109-94.
</P>
<P>
   ''Technically, you could really start doing that in the first
quarter,'' Barkley said.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley, who said he has no second thoughts about his
retirement, recently signed a multiyear contract with Turner
Network Television starting next year, but is doing pre-game and
halftime work in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just had an interesting conversation about it,'' he said
concerning the strategy of intentionally fouling O'Neal, an
unreliable performer from the foul line. ''Should we change the
rule for one guy? I said I didn't know, but for the good of the
game, maybe so.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley repeated what he's said previously about O'Neal: ''If he
made free throws, he'd be the best player that ever lived.''
</P>
<P>
   About the fight the two got into early in the season, causing
both to be ejected and suspended for one game, Barkley said,
''That's no big deal, man. I like Shaq a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley had a stronger opinion concerning Portland's Rasheed
Wallace, who was ejected from Game 1 after picking up his second
technical foul with 6:43 left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's got to quit getting them, it's a no-brainer, simple
common sense,'' Barkley said of Wallace's propensity for picking up
technical fouls. ''He's the only chance the Blazers have, he's the
best player Portland has. If he and Brian Grant don't dominate at
the power forward position, they don't have a chance.''

<HEADLINE> Teen Murder Witness Killed in RI  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID RISING
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- A 15-year-old girl who was a key witness
in a murder case was fatally shot in the head the day before the
trial was to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Rivera, who was shot Sunday night near her home, died
Monday night. The trial was postponed earlier Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for murder defendant Charles Pona, 19, denied he was
involved. He had been free on bail.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no indication that my client had anything to do with
this at all,'' defense attorney Joseph Voccola said.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Guido Laorenza said investigators were pursuing a suspect
but he would not discuss specifics. It was too soon to know whether
the girl's shooting was linked to the trial, he said. She had not
asked for police protection.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is that something we're going to pursue as a possible motive?
Yes. Can we verify that? No,'' Laorenza said.
</P>
<P>
   A witness who lives near the girl said he heard three shots,
then he and others ran to the corner and saw the girl lying on the
ground bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   Pona was scheduled to be tried Monday in the August shooting
death of Hector Feliciano, 17, in what investigators believe was a
drug-related attack.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer, until recently a student at Roger Wiliams Middle
School, testified at Pona's bail hearing last year that she saw a
person fitting his description fleeing the scene of the slaying,
said Jim Martin, the attorney general's spokesman. He would not
comment further about her testimony or her connection with Pona.
</P>
<P>
   Eva Quinonez, a teen-ager who said she was Jennifer's friend and
schoolmate, said the girl recently confided that she had been
threatened.
</P>
<P>
   ''She just told me that somebody was looking for her to kill
her,'' Quinonez said.
</P>
<P>
   Pona had been held in state prison since November, serving a
six-month sentence for obstructing a police officer. He was
released April 22, and posted $100,000 bail in connection with the
murder charge, Department of Corrections spokesman Al Bucci said.
</P>
<P>
   Pona appeared Monday in Superior Court where a prosecutor asked
that his bail be revoked. Police had gone to his home before dawn
Monday and found that he had moved without notifying them.
</P>
<P>
   The judge refused, instead imposing an 11 p.m. curfew on Pona
and requiring him to report to a court clerk every day. The
prosecutor did not say whether Pona was a suspect in the shooting,
but mentioned the incident while trying to convince the judge Pona
was a threat to the public.
</P>
<P>
   In Pona's Nov. 15 bail hearing, Jennifer testified she was
cooking in her first floor apartment when she heard gunshots from
outside. She rushed to the window and saw a dark-skinned man hop a
fence in a vacant lot, run to a sport utility vehicle, and drive
away.
</P>
<P>
   The teen identified that man from police photos as Pona.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looked like him, like the one I saw the day of the
murder,'' she testified.
</P>
<P>
   Pona's attorney asked the girl why she looked out her window
when the bangs could have just been a car backfiring.
</P>
<P>
   ''Come on that's not the first time I've heard a gun,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Thomas Connors said he had hoped to get the
chance to question the girl's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd rather have her on the stand because every time she's
testified, she's told a different story,'' Connors said.

Alberta Hospitals Prepare for Strike
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- Thousands of patients were affected
Monday as hospitals across Alberta prepared for a massive illegal
strike by juggling surgeries and looking at who they could send
home early.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term care centers and psychiatric facilities were also
getting ready as the clock ticked down to a Wednesday deadline set
by 10,000 health workers who intend to walk off the job if deals
can't be reached by then.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Alberta Labor Relations Board ordered the Alberta
Union of Provincial Employees to ''cease and desist'' in its threat
to strike at 159 hospitals and continuing care centers across the
province.
</P>
<P>
   Union president Dan MacLennan, who says the labor board is no
friend to workers, said they will not obey the order. It would be
the largest strike in the history of the province's largest union.

Victoria Day Weekend Marred by Accidents
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- The Victoria Day long weekend, traditionally a
time when winter-weary Canadians celebrate the coming of summer,
was marred by several deaths this year, including a promising
Prairie hockey player who died during a wilderness adventure and
two scientists who perished in a helicopter crash in a remote area
of Nunavut.
</P>
<P>
   In Saskatchewan and Manitoba, hockey fans were stunned to hear
that 19-year-old Kyle Johnson, a promising junior player was found
dead early Saturday evening in a rugged forested area northwest of
Kenora, Ontario
</P>
<P>
   The Winnipeg teen, a forward with the Melfort Mustangs of the
Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League, led the league with 46 goals
this season.
</P>
<P>
   He had been part of a group of 18- to 23-year-olds on a
wilderness vacation tour. The company that runs the tours said only
that ''an unfortunate incident,'' that led to the teen's death.
</P>
<P>
   In the northern community of Resolute, Nunavut, two scientists
doing research on polar bears were killed Sunday when their
helicopter crashed, shattering into pieces. The victims were not
identified.

   Illness to 78-Year-Old Rocket Richard Stirs Concern
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Gloomy reports that Maurice ''Rocket'' Richard
was on his death bed during the weekend once again drew attention
to how revered the hockey legend is in his home province.
</P>
<P>
   At a hastily called news conference at Hotel Dieu hospital on
Sunday, Dr. Andre Robidoux had a calming message.
</P>
<P>
   The 78-year-old Richard's cancer had not spread throughout his
body, he was not semi-comatose and he did not also have Alzheimer's
disease, said Robidoux, shooting down a week's worth of
panic-tinged reports.
</P>
<P>
   The Rocket remains very ill, he said. A cancerous tumor in his
abdomen that first appeared nearly three years ago had recurred and
doctors were monitoring his condition to see what treatment they
could use.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital did not provide new information on Richard's
condition Monday.
</P>
<P>
   While the Rocket is a hockey legend across Canada, he's more
than that in Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   Richard once insisted: ''I'm not a politician, I'm just a hockey
player.'' But for many, he is a symbol of French-Canadian pride and
accomplishment.

<HEADLINE> Four Republican hopefuls crowd the stage for cable TV debate  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDISON, N.J. (AP) -- The four candidates for the Republican
nomination for U.S. Senate haggled over taxes, land preservation
and guns in a televised debate Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Republican candidates U.S. Rep. Bob Franks, R-Berkeley Heights;
state Sen. William Gormley, R-Atlantic; Essex County executive Jim
Treffinger; and Ramapo College professor Murray Sabrin were given
some chances to get at each other, and they used them.
</P>
<P>
   Franks tried to link Gormley to former Gov. Jim Florio -- now a
Democratic primary candidate -- on taxes and on New Jersey's ban on
semi-automatic rifles. Franks in the process criticized the state's
law for taking guns away from law-abiding citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ''You were the only Republican in the entire Legislature to
stand shoulder to shoulder with Jim Florio to vote for that
particular ban,'' Franks said. ''How can the voters believe you
don't have a working relationship that really goes over the line to
work with liberal Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Gormley said Franks was distorting history. He then criticized
him for missing those gun control votes when he was in the state
Assembly. ''We are going to stand up to groups, special interests,
like the NRA. That's got to be our message,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gormley said Franks flipped while in Congress when he voted to
impeach President Clinton, then voted to urge the Senate not to
eject him from office. Franks said, ''Bill, I never heard from you
on the impeachment issue. While you were at home watching the
debate on C-SPAN, I was down there making the toughest vote of my
political career.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans also parted ways on land development. Gormley,
Franks and Treffinger endorsed open space preservation, but
Treffinger and Gormley criticized a bill in Congress to allow
developers to fight land regulations in court. Franks defended it,
saying land owners should have remedies when regulations damage the
value of their property.
</P>
<P>
   Sabrin denounced land preservation altogether. ''When people see
sprawl, they see problems. I see prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate was broadcast live on the News 12 New Jersey cable TV
station. When the candidates did not tangle directly, they staked
out a few unique positions.
</P>
<P>
   Gormley supported GOP presidential nominee George W. Bush's plan
to allow workers to withhold some Social Security payroll taxes and
to put their money into stock market funds instead. ''I think he's
definitely on the right track,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Treffinger called for scrapping the entire federal tax code and
endorsed a flat tax with large exemptions for families and
children.
</P>
<P>
   Franks called for sharp cuts in regulations that control housing
development, claiming that such rules drive up housing costs by a
third. ''Too many regulations which burden our economy are
inefficient and miss the mark,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sabrin wanted a full repeal of affirmative action programs,
calling them racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   For all four, the debate presented a crucial chance not only to
contrast themselves with their opponents but to make themselves
known to voters in the first place. The primary is June 6 and the
GOP race has been somewhat overshadowed by the Democratic primary
between the high-spending Jon Corzine and Florio.
</P>
<P>
   Franks and Gormley are seen as the leaders of the GOP pack based
on support from within the ranks of the Republican Party, although
the few polls taken suggest all of them are close and are virtually
unknown to voters. Treffinger has a formidable base of support in
Essex and Passaic counties, and has joined the two leaders in
raising more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   While the other GOP campaigns have tried to dismiss Sabrin, who
ran for governor in 1997 as a Libertarian, few outside observers
are willing to dismiss him because of his appeal to anti-abortion
and antigun control groups.
</P>
<P>
   Sabrin, asked to explain his conversion to the Republican Party,
said, ''As they say in politics, you want to get on the fastest bus
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Franks, Gormley and Treffinger all support abortion rights
within limits, endorsing a law against a late-term procedure
opponents call ''partial birth abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabrin ridiculed their stance. ''If you believe partial birth is
wrong, then you have to believe that all abortion is wrong in that
context,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates are scheduled to debate again Tuesday on WABC
radio in New York, and Friday in WPVI-TV studios in Trenton for
broadcast over the weekend on WPVI-TV in Philadelphia and WABC-TV
in New York.

<HEADLINE> Railroad Killer Gets Death Penalty  </HEADLINE>
By MARK BABINECK
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- The admitted railroad killer who made the FBI's
10 Most Wanted List was sentenced to death Monday for killing a
Houston-area doctor, one of nine murders he was accused of
committing.
</P>
<P>
   The jury that convicted Angel Maturino Resendiz of capital
murder last week met for just less than two hours before deciding
on the death sentence. The panel could have sentenced the Mexican
drifter to life in prison. He had asked for the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Before State District Judge Bill Harmon imposed the sentence, he
asked Maturino Resendiz if he had anything to say.
</P>
<P>
   ''That police officer lied under oath, and I don't think that
it's right,'' Maturino Resendiz said, pointing to Texas Ranger Sgt.
Drew Carter. ''He lied under oath.''
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendiz surrendered to Carter on the American side of
the border with Mexico after the officer brokered a deal with the
suspect's sister. The defense said the family was misled to believe
that if Maturino Resendiz surrendered, he would not be subject to
the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon ignored the comment and told him an appeal of his death
sentence was automatic.
</P>
<P>
   The rail-riding drifter has acknowledged committing the murders.
He sought capital punishment over the objections of his attorneys,
who argued that their client is insane.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the jury rejected the insanity plea and convicted
Maturino Resendiz of capital murder in the death of Claudia Benton,
who was attacked and bludgeoned in her own home just before
Christmas 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has forfeited his right to be among us,'' prosecutor Devon
Anderson said, asking jurors for the death penalty in closing
arguments Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Allen Tanner said Maturino Resendiz had been
unfairly tricked into surrendering on the Texas side of the border
so he could be eligible for the death penalty, which Mexico does
not impose.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a case of where our government lured a sick man across
the bridge promising him and his family he would receive humane
treatment,'' Tanner said. ''He received humane treatment and now
it's time to kill him. We can't as a nation put up with that kind
of activity.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's final witness Monday was its most powerful. The
woman, whose name was withheld, testified about being beaten and
raped along a Lexington, Ky., railroad line in the early hours of
Aug. 29, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendiz emerged from the darkness as the woman and her
boyfriend, fellow University of Kentucky student Christopher Maier,
21, were drinking beer and watching trains go by as they trekked
between fraternity parties. At first the attacker robbed them with
an unknown sharp object in his hand, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the drifter tied them up and dragged Maier away.
</P>
<P>
   ''Chris was saying, 'Don't hurt her, leave her alone,' '' the
woman said, fighting through tears. ''He came over and hit Chris.
It seemed like a big log, but it was a rock, I found out later.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard Chris gurgling and asked (Maturino Resendiz) to go
make sure Chris' head was turned to the side to make sure Chris
wouldn't choke on his own blood,'' she continued. ''He did, and
then said, 'He's gone. You won't have to worry about him anymore.'
''
</P>
<P>
   As Maturino Resendiz advanced upon her, the woman said she was
kicking and screaming until he jabbed her in the neck with the
sharp object.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said, 'Look how easily I could kill you,' '' she testified.
''So I just stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   Maier's was the first known death in a two-year killing spree
that caught the nation's attention last spring when investigators
realized that the same person likely was responsible for several
slayings near railroad tracks, mostly in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   There was outrage when it was learned that Maturino Resendiz,
already a suspect, was arrested by Border Patrol agents in New
Mexico on June 2, 1999, only to be released into Mexico. He was
tied to two Texas slayings and two more in Illinois before Carter
brokered his July 13 surrender.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendiz, a Mexican citizen, also has told the court he
would drop any and all appeals, which would mean he could be
executed in as soon as one year if the initial automatic review of
his case finds no errors.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Renewed in Nigeria  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KADUNA, Nigeria (AP) -- Christians and Muslims battled with
clubs, stones and machetes in the streets of this northern Nigerian
city on Monday, burning homes and places of worship.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said up to five people were killed, although that
figure couldn't be independently confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting was a revival of bitter religious bloodletting
touched off in Kaduna earlier this year by calls for Islamic law,
or sharia, in some Nigerian states. Up to 2,000 died in the earlier
fighting, many of them in Kaduna.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers were hurriedly sent into the streets on Monday. Police
commissioner Mohammed Shehu said the trouble began after some
residents in the predominantly Christian neighborhood of Narayi
blamed Muslims for an earlier murder of a local man.
</P>
<P>
   They attacked and burned homes of Muslims who quickly launched
reprisals. Several Christian churches were torched.
</P>
<P>
   Many distraught civilians took refuge in police and army
barracks. Shops and offices were quickly closed.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic fighting is fueled not only by calls for sharia, but
also by Nigeria's web of ethnic disputes and the north's waning
power since democratic rule was instituted last year.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Nigeria is predominantly Christian, and northern
Nigeria is overwhelmingly Muslim. Northerners dominate Nigeria's
military, and wielded immense power during the 15 years of army
rule, which ended last year with President Olusegun Obasanjo's
election.
</P>
<P>
   Muslim law prohibits drinking alcohol, and under some
interpretations, calls for separate schools and public
transportation for men and women.

<HEADLINE> OAS Ends Peru Election Cooperation  </HEADLINE>

<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Alejandro Toledo officially withdrew Monday
from the presidential runoff scheduled for May 28, accusing
incumbent President Alberto Fujimori of rigging votes.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Bringas of the National Election Board said the move gave
Fujimori an automatic re-election victory. The full, five-member
board, however, did not announce its position.
</P>
<P>
   Legal expert Francisco Chirinos Soto said the Fujimori-dominated
board would be violating the constitution if it declared him
president without a second round.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo filed a formal letter of withdrawal with the board
Monday, announcing that he would not participate unless the runoff
was set for a later date. Last Thursday, he announced he was
boycotting the runoff, but did not officially withdraw until
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo said his political movement was not withdrawing from the
race, but ''it simply will not participate in the elections called
for May 28. We will continue with the campaign until conditions for
a cleaner and more transparent electoral process are established.''
</P>
<P>
   The election board on Thursday rejected Toledo's demand to
postpone the election until June 18 to allow time to clean up a
vote-counting system that he said had been rigged to give Fujimori
a third five-year term. The first round took place on April 9.
</P>
<P>
   The runoff, though, was already in doubt. Earlier Monday,
international monitors said they found grave flaws in the
vote-counting software and were suspending cooperation with
Peruvian election officials. The Organization of American States
accused the officials of trying to use the observers to endorse the
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   ''They want to use our observation personnel to validate or
endorse situations that ... contradict what our own observers are
reporting,'' said Eduardo Stein, head of the OAS mission.
</P>
<P>
   Peru's official election organizers said computer software
crucial to validating May 28's presidential runoff between Fujimori
and Toledo had passed a trial run Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But a statement from the OAS mission said it had observed
''grave difficulties and serious problems nationwide in the
operation of the computer system during the trial.''
</P>
<P>
   The OAS mission had warned on Thursday that it would not endorse
the runoff between Fujimori and Toledo if election officials did
not correct by Monday the irregularities that had tainted the first
round.
</P>
<P>
   The Peruvian Ombudsman's Office also rejected the election
officials' report that the trial had been successful.
</P>
<P>
   The independent El Comercio newspaper, quoting unidentified
sources close to the election board, said the software had failed
to properly tally votes cast outside Lima.
</P>
<P>
   Riot police used tear gas on Monday to break up some 200 Toledo
supporters who tried to prevent Fujimori from holding a campaign
rally in the southern Andean city of Arequipa, 465 miles southeast
of the capital, Lima. The rally went on, but Fujimori was forced to
stand behind security guards with plastic shields who deflected
flying fruit and pieces of wood.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori fell about 20,000 votes short of an outright win in the
first round, forcing him into a runoff against Toledo, a
U.S.-educated economist who grew up in poverty. Fujimori won 49.9
percent of the vote, against 40.2 percent for Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo decided to withdraw despite recent polls showing him tied
with Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
   In the first round, Toledo was routinely met on the campaign
trail by pro-Fujimori demonstrators, who hurled insults, eggs and
rocks at him. He received little coverage from television stations
and was the target of smear attacks in the tabloid press.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo said the modest improvements in media coverage noted by
monitors in recent weeks could not make up for months of dirty
tactics designed to destroy his candidacy, including phone-taps and
death threats.

<HEADLINE> Nedrow man pleads innocent to arson  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- An Onondaga County man pleaded innocent
Monday to charges that he set a barn fire and killed 12 horses last
December.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Furgal, 19, is accused of pouring gasoline on the barn at
Quarry Ridge Stables in Nedrow. Furgal worked as a laborer at the
stables, and the owner provided him with food and a place to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Furgal set the fire because he was angry at Lori Lorini, who
owned the horses, and her friend. Lorini rented the barn for $400 a
month from Quarry Road Stables, a sprawling horse farm just south
of Syracuse owned by Phil Bowen.
</P>
<P>
   According to court papers, Furgal initially told deputies the
fire was an accident and that the flames erupted while he was
splashing gasoline on an incinerator next to the barn. He later
admitted he intentionally set the barn ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   But he claimed he never intended to hurt the horses.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by 1,500 bales of hay stored inside for the winter, the
fire turned the barn into a roaring inferno that took 100
firefighters from seven suburban departments four hours to bring
under control. Furgal stood with a crowd and watched the barn burn.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the barn housed as many as 19 horses but the
remains of only 12 of the animals were found after the fire was
extinguished.
</P>
<P>
   Furgal faces up to 24 years in prison. He's being held at the
Onondaga County Justice Center.

deal will result in the loss of 872,000 American jobs over the next decade.
Preposterous, says the Clinton administration, which published its own

<HEADLINE> Devils 4, Flyers 1  </HEADLINE>
By IRA PODELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The New Jersey Devils were not ready to make
an exit out of the Stanley Cup playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Eastern Conference finals are moving back up the New
Jersey Turnpike for Game 6 as Jason Arnott, Bobby Holik, Petr
Sykora and Patrik Elias scored for the Devils in a 4-1 victory
Monday night over the Philadelphia Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers still lead 3-2 in the best-of-seven series that
continues Wednesday night at Continental Airlines Arena. Game 7, if
necessary, would be Friday in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia, which won three straight after dropping the series
opener, might have star center Eric Lindros back by then. Lindros,
who has had two concussions in the last three months, was cleared
by his doctor Monday to resume full team practices.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen teams have rallied from 3-1 deficits to win a series,
but never in a conference final. That does not include two teams
which came back from 3-0 to win. The Flyers are 14-1 in series in
which they have taken a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The road team has won each game in this series except for Game 2
when the Flyers got even. Philadelphia, 6-1 in road playoff games
this season, is only 5-4 at the First Union Center.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the second time in franchise history that the Devils
avoided elimination on the road. New Jersey won Game 7 of the
division finals at Washington in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Brodeur, who was not sharp in the previous two losses,
looked much better and made 20 saves for his 10th playoff victory
this season. The Flyers had 21 shots for the third straight game,
matching their playoff low.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey center Sergei Nemchinov left with 3:02 gone in the
second period after he was bloodied by a check from John LeClair.
Nemchinov took 40 stitches to the left side of his head after
striking the glass near the penalty box and then was rammed into a
metal partition holding it in place.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils responded to the screaming done by coach Larry
Robinson following their 3-1 loss at home in Game 4 when they
allowed two goals in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey came out fast and hard and grabbed a 1-0 lead when
Arnott scored his fourth playoff goal 10:25 in, with two seconds
remaining on a power play. Holik made it 2-0 just 4:50 later.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Malakhov fired a shot that Flyers goalie Brian Boucher
stopped with his pad. The rebound came out to Holik, who put it
past Boucher who was sprawled out on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Holik, who took four shots in the first period, scored his third
goal of the playoffs -- all in this series. Prior to scoring in Game
1, Holik went 28 playoff games without a goal dating to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey dominated play throughout the period, finishing with
a 14-6 shots advantage and didn't waste any time stretching the
lead to 3-0 in the second when Sykora scored his sixth goal.
</P>
<P>
   Elias' pass attempt to Sykora was blocked by Flyers defenseman
Luke Richardson. Elias got it back and moved it to Sykora, who put
a shot behind Boucher at 1:47.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers got on the board with 4:15 left in the second on
Valeri Zelepukin's first goal. The goal was the first the Devils
allowed this series in nine short-handed situations. It snapped New
Jersey's streak of 32 straight penalty kills dating to the last
round against Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The goal came when Brodeur swung the puck around the boards
behind his net. Mark Recchi intercepted and passed out in front to
Zelepukin. Brodeur went down, scrambling to get back into position
as Zelepukin skated deftly around him and tucked the puck into the
lower right corner of the net.
</P>
<P>
   Elias put the game away 54 seconds into the third with his fifth
goal. After a giveaway in neutral ice, Elias skated in and beat
Boucher between the pads with a backhander. The Flyers rookie
goalie stopped 26 saves.
</P>
<P>
   Flyers center Daymond Langkow returned to action after missing
the previous two games with a concussion.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Disbarment Recommended  </HEADLINE>
By JAMES JEFFERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Delivering a post-impeachment rebuke,
an Arkansas Supreme Court committee decided Monday that President
Clinton should be disbarred for ''serious misconduct'' in the Paula
Jones case and began the court proceeding to strip him of his law
license.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of the panelists who met on Friday said the president
should be disciplined for denying a sexual relationship with Monica
Lewinsky during a deposition he gave in the Jones sexual harassment
case in January 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendation from the Committee of Professional Conduct
now goes to a Circuit Court judge in Little Rock for disbarment
proceedings. If the judge disbars Clinton, the president can appeal
to the state Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton attorney David Kendall said in a statement: ''This
recommendation is wrong and clearly contradicted by precedent. We
will vigorously dispute it in a court of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told ''NBC Nightly News'' that he will not personally
defend himself at the disbarment proceedings because it would
interfere with his duties as president. He also said the committee
was responding too harshly to his testimony that he has labeled as
''legally accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The only reason I agreed even to an appeal of this is, my
lawyers looked at all the precedents and they said, 'There's no way
in the world if they just treat you like everybody else has been
treated, that this is even close to that kind of case,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The action against Clinton's license marks the third form of
punishment the president has faced for his false testimony in the
Jones case. He was impeached by the House, then acquitted at a
Senate trial. And a federal judge fined him after finding him in
contempt of court.
</P>
<P>
   The president has insisted that he did not lie when he denied
having a sexual relationship with Lewinsky; he has said that the
relationship did not meet the definition of sex that was given at
the start of the deposition.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who was Arkansas governor from 1979 to 1981 and again
from 1983 until he was elected president in 1992, has been a lawyer
for more than 25 years and taught at the University of Arkansas law
school. He has not practiced since the early 1980s, between his
first and second terms as governor.
</P>
<P>
   ''This action is being taken against (Clinton) as a result of
the formal complaints ... and the findings by a majority of the
committee that certain of the attorney's conduct, as demonstrated
in the complaint, constituted serious misconduct,'' in violation of
state rules governing lawyers, the disciplinary committee's
executive director, James Neal, said in a letter to the court
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The committee has 14 full-time members -- lawyers and nonlawyers
-- who sit in panels of seven. Because of Clinton's widespread
connections throughout the state, eight of the panelists bowed out
before Friday's meeting, most of them citing potential conflicts of
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Of the six who heard Clinton's case, five are lawyers and the
sixth is a retired schoolteacher. At least two are Democrats; three
have not identified their affiliation because voters are not
required to do so in Arkansas. Whether the sixth member has
identified a party affiliation could not be determined.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, the committee said it would not consider discipline
for Hillary Rodham Clinton for work tied to the Whitewater scandal.
The Landmark Legal Foundation sought an inquiry after federal
regulators found in 1996 that Mrs. Clinton, as a lawyer in Little
Rock, created a real estate document later used by her Whitewater
partners' savings and loan to deceive federal regulators. The panel
said there was not ''a sufficient basis'' to pursue Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Southeastern Legal Foundation, a conservative law firm in
Atlanta, and U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright, who presided
over the Jones case, had filed the complaints against the president
with the committee. The foundation wanted Clinton disbarred; Wright
-- who last year cited Clinton for civil contempt and fined him
$90,000 for giving ''intentionally false'' testimony -- did not
suggest a specific penalty from the committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a confirmation that the legal system will police its
own, regardless of the position held by the attorney in question,''
said Matt Glavin, president of the foundation. ''Remember, this is
the first time in American history that a sitting president faced
disciplinary proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   President Nixon was disbarred by a New York court after
resigning over the Watergate scandal in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton sought something no harsher than a letter of reprimand,
according to Glavin. The president's defense has been sealed.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the foundation cited the Nixon case, saying the
court that disbarred him ''said the offense was made worse because
Nixon was president at the time 'and in a position of public
trust.'''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation also cited a 1998 disbarment case in which the
Arkansas Supreme Court wrote: ''There simply is no place in the law
for a person who will not or cannot tell the truth in court, even
when his or her own interests are involved.''
</P>
<P>
   In his deposition, Clinton said: ''I have never had sexual
relations with Monica Lewinsky.'' He acknowledged Aug. 17 before a
federal grand jury -- and again in a nationally televised address --
that he had an inappropriate relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In Jones' harassment case, the former state employee alleged
that Clinton exposed himself to her and made a sexual advance in a
Little Rock hotel room in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Wright dismissed Jones' case in 1998, saying that what Clinton
was alleged to have done may have been ''boorish'' but did not
amount to sexual harassment. A year later, when the judge found
Clinton in contempt, she said his misleading testimony had no
bearing on the outcome of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Jones lawyers' drew Lewinsky into the case in an attempt to show
a pattern of sexual misconduct by Clinton. Independent counsel
Kenneth Starr then picked up the trail, and his investigation led
to Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for Jones, Gilbert K. Davis, said the disbarment
ruling was a ''victory for all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I look at it as a benefit to the judicial system,'' he said.
''Courts don't have police and armies to enforce their policies.
It's an important lesson that needs to be driven home to Americans,
that we value this system.''
</P>
<P>
   Some law professors agreed with the ruling, while others said it
was uncalled for.
</P>
<P>
   Akhil Amar of Yale University said disbarment ''may be a good
punishment that fits the crime,'' while impeachment and removal
from office ''was seen as disproportionate.'' However, Amar
questioned whether it would have been wiser to wait until after
Clinton left office.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Rothstein at Georgetown University said that ''in my view,
he has been punished'' and that the committee should have
recommended a reprimand at most.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it is piling on,'' Rothstein said. ''I think he is
being punished more for his prominence.''

<HEADLINE> No Suprises At Baseball Factory  </HEADLINE>
By WILL WEISSERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   TURRIALBA, Costa Rica (AP) -- A day after a record six grand
slams and 56 home runs were hit in the majors, a van full of
baseball executives showed up at the Rawlings factory Monday for a
long-scheduled look at how big league baseballs are made.
</P>
<P>
   Their conclusion: It's not the balls' fault.
</P>
<P>
   ''We came away very impressed with the operations here,'' Sandy
Alderson, the majors' executive vice president for operations, said
after a 2{-hour tour of the plant where all major and minor league
baseballs are made. ''We weren't looking for surprises, it was an
educational process.''
</P>
<P>
   With Rawlings balls flying out of major league parks at a
record-setting pace, Alderson said he took a tour of the
unassuming, about 900-employee factory in Costa Rica's
coffee-growing region to ''get more familiar with what goes into
making a baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not enough for us to tell the media and the fans that
there's nothing wrong with the ball,'' said Alderson, who was
careful not to say the word ''juiced.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to be more familiar with the process ourselves,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   There were 931 home runs in the majors in April, a record for
the month and up 15 percent over April 1999.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, along with the record six slams, there were 56 home
runs -- one off the record for a day, set on April 7.
</P>
<P>
   Alderson said he thought stronger hitters, smaller ballparks and
a pitching talent pool thinned somewhat by expansion all
contributed to 2000's homer-happy season.
</P>
<P>
   He left the tour believing that the balls hand-stitched in this
factory some 46 miles southeast of San Jose could somehow be
altered to become more hittable. But he added he did not think that
was happening.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not a physicist,'' Alderson said. ''But I think you could
look at each component of how the ball is made and realize there
could be ways to make slight changes.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I am now confident there is no difference in the balls being
made here now and those being made here at the start of last
season,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alderson joined Rawlings executive vice president and former
infielder Ted Sizemore, players' union representative and former
pitcher Steve Rogers and two other executives from the
commissioner's office, Jimmie Lee Solomon and Ray Krasik, on a tour
that used to be taken by the presidents of the American and
National leagues since Rawlings moved its ball-production
operations here from Haiti in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Also along for Monday's tour of the factory, which sounds like a
giant washing machine from the outside, was Larry Fallen, who is
associated with University of Massachusetts at Lowell engineers who
are currently comparing balls made this year with those produced by
Rawlings in years past -- searching for even the slightest
difference.
</P>
<P>
   From Costa Rica, baseball's global inspecting team will head to
the St. Louis-based Rawlings facilities in suburban Missouri, where
balls are tested after making the trip from this working-class town
of about 20,000 to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Alderson said that with attendance up 6 percent this season, no
one in baseball is necessarily complaining about the overabundance
of homers -- a feature some say is the first thing that has been
able to win back fans disenchanted by 1994's strike.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a tension between the historical integrity of the game
and the entertainment factor and interest level that exists
today,'' he said. ''We need to try to devise a balance between
those two things and knowing as much we can about the process will
help us to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Alderson said one possible option baseball may try to slow the
barrage of offense the game has seen in recent years would be to
raise the pitching mound from 10 to 16 inches -- a technique it may
test this year on Class A minor league farm systems like the
Arizona Rookie League and the Gulf Coast League.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a good possibility we could do that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1968 season, in which 1-0 pitcher's duels became the
norm, baseball lowered the mound to shake pitcher's dominance on
the game.
</P>
<P>
   And did Monday's group feel a little strange heading down to
Costa Rica to check on the baseball factory mere hours after all
the grand slams in the majors?
</P>
<P>
   ''No, because any day we came down here there could have been
some ironic offense record set the day before,'' Alderson said.
''Those weren't bad baseballs, those were bad pitches.''

McCain Preaches Unity at GOP Dinner

<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Saying that ''now is the time for
unity,'' Sen. John McCain urged supporters attending a state
Republican Party fund-raiser Monday night to join him in helping to
elect George W. Bush as president.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Republican earned a standing ovation when he said
his former rival for the GOP presidential nomination would restore
integrity and purpose to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ''I ask all McCain supporters to join me in helping elect
Governor George Bush,'' McCain said. ''Now is the time for unity.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain was the keynote speaker at the Prescott Bush Award
Dinner, named for Bush's late grandfather, a Greenwich Republican
and U.S. senator. The event raised about $250,000 from more than
900 Republicans who paid $200 per plate and $1,000 to attend a
private, predinner reception.
</P>
<P>
   McCain won Connecticut's primary March 7 but dropped from the
race after losses in other states that night. He said he did not
have trouble speaking at an event full of Bush supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to move forward and not look back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also drew laughs by noting that he joined Barry Goldwater
and other unsuccessful presidential candidates from Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ''Arizona may be the only state in America where mothers don't
tell their children someday they may grow up to become president of
the United States,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Faulty Recorder Hampers Crash Probe  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER NEWTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) -- Investigators on Monday were looking
into whether fuel problems caused both engines to fail aboard a
charter plane that crashed, killing all 19 people aboard. But the
probe was hampered because the cockpit voice recorder was not
working at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board investigators searched
for clues in the wreckage after Sunday's crash of the Executive
Airlines twin-engine turboprop, which was carrying 17 passengers
home from a gambling trip to Atlantic City, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The two pilots, who also were killed, had reported to air
traffic controllers that they lost both engines as they made their
second approach to the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton airport in the rain.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation analysts said dual-engine failures are rare and can
indicate a problem with the fuel supply.
</P>
<P>
   NTSB member George Black said investigators were ''looking at
fuel and fuel systems,'' including whether the fuel was
contaminated.
</P>
<P>
   However, Black said later that no evidence of contamination was
found in a preliminary test of the fuel from a truck in
Farmingdale, N.Y., that had refueled the plane. The tests were
continuing and would include a ground sample from the crash site.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators did not rule out that the plane could have been
low on fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Black also said the voice recorder had an improper power supply
and did not record any sounds in the cockpit. Plus, the plane did
not have the other type of ''black box'' recorder, the one that
takes down flight data such as speed and altitude, because it was
not required for the model of airplane, a Jetstream 31.
</P>
<P>
   ''This seriously hampers the investigation,'' Black said. ''This
is somewhat disappointing, and we're going to do the best we can
without it.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Monday, Black said the company had told the NTSB that the
recorder may have been specially modified to operate on the plane's
power source without the inverter. NTSB officials were
investigating that possibility, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said investigators will rely on the wreckage, witnesses,
radar data and conversations between the pilots and air traffic
controllers.
</P>
<P>
   Black said officials spent the late afternoon Monday
interviewing three people who heard the plane crash and another
person who saw it.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of the earwitnesses gave remarkably consistent
information, saying that there was a sound in the engines that
reflected an increase in power,'' Black said. ''The eyewitness said
the plane was level with its (landing) gear up when it disappeared
over the tree line.''
</P>
<P>
   The plane left Farmingdale on Sunday morning, picked up the
passengers about 10:30 a.m. in Atlantic City and then headed to
Wilkes-Barre for the one-hour, 150-mile flight.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Hartt, spokesman for the South Jersey Transportation
Authority, which operates the Atlantic City Airport, said the
aircraft received no fuel or repairs there. The director of the
airport in Farmingdale, Hugh Jones, referred all questions about
the plane to the NTSB.
</P>
<P>
   John Nance, an aviation analyst in Tacoma, Wash., said one
failed engine is a ''very rare event.''
</P>
<P>
   ''To have two fail simultaneously is simply beyond the realm of
probability,'' he said. ''What will cause two engines to stop
running simultaneously is an interruption in the fuel supply. It
could be some sort of catastrophic problem with the pumping system
or the plumbing of the fuel system.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Peragine, chief executive of the Farmingdale-based
Executive Airlines, said the company had never had problems with
the 12-year-old plane. He said the pilot had 8,500 hours of flight
time, ''a relatively high amount of time,'' and the co-pilot was
about to be upgraded to captain.
</P>
<P>
   ''These were two expert pilots and the machine was maintained to
the highest standards,'' Peragine said. ''You just don't have a
clue as to what could have possibly happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The plane went down about nine miles from the
Wilkes-Barre/Scranton airport at 11:48 a.m. Sunday. Black said the
plane might have missed its first approach because of bad weather.
It was raining, and visibility was poor.
</P>
<P>
   As investigators looked for clues, nearby communities mourned
the victims, who had gone to Atlantic City on Saturday afternoon on
the flight chartered by Caesars Atlantic City Hotel Casino.
</P>
<P>
   Debra Maleski lost her mother, Nancy Maleski, 66, of Moosic, and
sister Elaine Pilosi, 46. She said the casino chartered the flight
every other weekend from Wilkes-Barre.
</P>
<P>
   ''They just went for an evening of fun and excitement. They
played the slots,'' Maleski said. ''They didn't like to fly, either
one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents in the small communities near Wilkes-Barre waited for
the coroner to post the list of victims.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you don't know somebody, you know someone who knows them,''
said Jerry Mancinelli of Dallas, Pa. ''Everybody in the valley is
going to be touched.''

<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Incessant weekend rains triggered
flooding and mudslides that killed at least 21 people, including
seven who died when a truck was swept away, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The cargo truck with 14 passengers aboard was crossing a bridge
in southern Putumayo State on Sunday when the San Miguel river rose
up and carried it downstream. The bodies of seven passengers were
found, and the others remained missing, said the state police
chief, Col. Daniel Ruiz.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve people died under torrents of earth in Pasto, capital of
southern Narino State, national disaster relief coordinator Eduardo
Jose Gonzalez told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The other two deaths were in Putumayo and Santander states.
</P>
<P>
   Televised images showed residents in several affected areas
paddling down streets in canoes or wading in knee-deep, muddy brown
water.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of families will have to be relocated, Gonzalez said.
Meteorologists predicted more heavy rains ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Flooding and mudslides commonly cause deaths in Colombia, where
poor people place homes on riverbanks, cliffs or at the foot of
deep ravines.

<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- U.S. Sen John McCain preached unity,
reform and the need to win over new voters at the state Republican
party's biggest annual fund-raiser Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Republican sparked a standing ovation when he said
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, his former rival for the Republican
nomination for president, would restore integrity and purpose to
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ''I ask all McCain supporters to join me in helping elect Gov.
George Bush,'' McCain said. ''Now is the time for unity.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain was the keynote speaker at the Prescott Bush Award
Dinner. The fund-raiser, named for Gov. Bush's late grandfather, a
Greenwich Republican who served in the U.S. Senate, attracted more
than 900 republicans and raised about $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John G. Rowland, who served in Congress with McCain, said
the senator's lobbying efforts for congressional candidates
nationwide would help Republicans maintain majorities in the House
and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who won Connecticut's March 7 primary but was forced to
drop out of the race after losses in other Super Tuesday primaries,
said his supporters would serve as delegates but ultimately support
Bush at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   McCain acknowledged he still has differences with Bush, but said
the candidate has campaigned well in recent months. He said Bush's
centrist message on education and health care have helped improve
his standing in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he did not have trouble speaking at an event full of
Bush supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to move forward and not look back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He drew laughs when he noted that he joined Barry Goldwater and

</P>
<P>
   ''Arizona may be the only state in America where mothers don't

</P>
<P>
   McCain, who attracted many Democrats and Independents his
campaign, said the party needs the support of new voters to be
successful.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our party should always broaden our base,'' he said. ''The
country is best served by a party that seeks to represent fairly
the dreams of all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said reforms are needed in education, the military and
the tax code.
</P>
<P>
   He accused President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore of
campaign finance abuses, saying they treated the Lincoln bedroom
like a Motel 6.
</P>
<P>
   Attendees paid $200 per plate and $1,000 for a private reception
before the dinner.

<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- A special police unit dealing with
threats to the Sydney Olympics has arrested a man and charged him
with possessing a cache of explosive substances, a police spokesman
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic Investigation Strike Force also seized what it said
were racist documents after arresting the 28-year-old man in Sydney
last Tuesday, the spokesman said on customary condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The man, who has changed his name to Martin Bormann, appeared in
court last Wednesday and was remanded in custody. Bormann was Nazi
leader Adolf Hitler's secretary.
</P>
<P>
   The man was due to appear in court Wednesday charged with two
counts of possessing explosive substances, one count of possessing
an article with intent to destroy property and one count of
possessing a knife in public.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily Telegraph, a Sydney tabloid, reported Tuesday that
police found hydrochloric acid, chlorine and petrol at the man's
home. He also had stored petrol and fertilizer in an underground
bunker west of Sydney, the paper reported.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone Soldiers Find Corpses  </HEADLINE>
By MIGUEL GIL MORENO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROGBERI JUNCTION, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Mutilated corpses
discovered in the bush Monday appeared to be U.N. peacekeepers
allegedly killed by Sierra Leone's rebels, a discovery that could
hinder efforts to free hundreds of captured U.N. troops.
</P>
<P>
   And in yet another blow to the embattled peacekeepers, two
members of Nigeria's contingent were killed in a nighttime
firefight in the capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   As United Nations forces struggled to establish control in the
West African nation, there was one piece of good news: Twenty-nine
U.N. captives were released Monday by Sierra Leone's guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels are still holding 250 or more of the 500 peacekeepers
they seized three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   In a gruesome scene northeast of the capital, an Associated
Press Television News cameraman saw what appeared to be at least
three corpses of U.N. peacekeepers in the bush about half a mile
from the town of Rogberi Junction.
</P>
<P>
   The severely hacked bodies were wearing Zambian military
uniforms and U.N. insignias.
</P>
<P>
   However, U.N. officials did not confirm they were peacekeepers,
noting that rebels had previously stripped the weapons and uniforms
of other U.N. captives and used them in subsequent battles.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to investigate this thoroughly,'' said U.N. spokesman
David Wimhurst. ''The fact that they were wearing Zambian uniforms
doesn't necessarily mean that they were Zambian.''
</P>
<P>
   A blue U.N. military helmet sat near the corpses, which were
lying in the grass. The helmet appeared to have been pierced by a
bullet.
</P>
<P>
   Zambian passports and military identification cards -- many
pierced with bullet holes -- were found in the molding pile of
corpses and uniforms. A former U.N. position had been burned to the
ground in Rogberi Junction, about 50 miles northeast of Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Leonean soldiers, who battled the rebels Sunday to
capture this key crossroads town, said other bodies were scattered
in the area, at least some wearing uniforms with the U.N. insignia.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers said nine to 11 U.N. peacekeepers were killed in
fighting earlier this month with rebels of the Revolutionary United
Front. At least one of the victims had his hands tied behind his
back, they said.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said there was a
gunbattle in the area May 6, but it was not clear whether the
bodies found Monday were U.N. peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   In Freetown, two Nigerian peacekeepers were gunned down in an
overnight battle at a U.N. post, U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the attackers did not belong to the RUF -- they came
from a group of soldiers loyal to former junta leader Johnny Paul
Koroma, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Koroma's men have been loosely aligned with the Sierra Leone
government army. But Koroma's fighters were apparently upset
because one of their colleagues had been arrested, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sierra Leone's Information Minister Julius Spencer
said there was ''no connection'' between rebel leader Foday
Sankoh's fate and the release of more U.N. hostages. The government
has not yet decided whether to prosecute Sankoh, who was captured
last week.
</P>
<P>
   A group of 54 U.N. peacekeepers was freed Sunday and another 29
were released Monday along Sierra Leone's border with Liberia.
</P>
<P>
   One freed captive, 57-year-old Naval Cmdr. Knut Gjellestad, a
Norwegian military observer, told of intoxicated rebels threatening
hostages.
</P>
<P>
   On two occasions, he thought he would be killed when rebel
fighters pointed a gun at his head, he told the Norwegian news
agency NTB.
</P>
<P>
   ''Psychologically I have managed well,'' he said. ''It swung
between laughter and tears.''
</P>
<P>
   ''When we were moved, we were bound. With me, they tightened up
extra hard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the group released Sunday looked thin and weak as they
walked off the plane, and U.N. officials have expressed concerns
for the health of the remaining captives.
</P>
<P>
   Three injured Kenyans were taken away in an ambulance. Several
of the freed hostages were suffering from malaria, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. contingent in Sierra Leone now numbers 10,400, the
largest U.N. peacekeeping deployment in the world, and U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan recommended Monday that the number of
troops be increased to 16,500.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, who also serves as President
Clinton's special envoy to Africa, returned to the United States
and said Monday that Sierra Leone's rebels should disarm
voluntarily or be disarmed.
</P>
<P>
   Continued fighting in Sierra Leone could ''create a domino
effect of instability in the region'' said Jackson, who visited
Nigeria, Mali and Liberia over the weekend.

<HEADLINE> Woody Williams Rejoins Padres  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Woody Williams rejoined the San Diego Padres on
Monday, 2{ weeks after having surgery to repair an aneurysm in his
right armpit, and said he'd like to be pitching again sometime
around the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Both Williams and trainer Todd Hutcheson said mid-July is a
realistic goal because the aneurysm was repaired without needing an
arterial graft.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who's to say it can't be quicker, who's to say it might be
longer?'' Williams said after taking grounders at third base during
batting practice before the Padres played the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ''But that's a fair amount of time. My body usually heals up
pretty quick and I'm able to bounce back a lot of times, a lot
better than some people, I guess,'' he said. ''I just want to get
back as soon as I can, as safe as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   When the aneurysm was diagnosed on May 2, the Padres compared it
to when New York Yankees pitcher David Cone had an aneurysm
surgically repaired in 1996. But Cone needed a graft to repair his
aneurysm while Williams did not.
</P>
<P>
   In Cone's case, the artery needed longer to heal because of the
graft, Hutcheson said. Cone was out that year from May until early
September, then no-hit the Oakland Athletics for seven innings in
his first start back.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were able to suture Woody's artery together and
basically, shortly after the surgery, they said the artery was
healed,'' Hutcheson said. ''It was just a matter of getting the
wound to heal and getting the muscle strong again and seeing how
that went.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams began his rehabilitation on Monday and might be able to
begin throwing in two to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander should be able to build his strength back
quickly in his shoulder but the key will be the circulation in his
hand, Hutcheson said. Before the aneurysm was discovered, Williams
complained that his fingers turned numb and cold when he pitched.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really won't know until he starts chucking again and see
how his hand reacts,'' Hutcheson said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides some tightness, his shoulder feels good, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   ''To me it's more serious because you're talking about my life,
my hand, but at the same time, coming back from it, I don't think
it's going to be as serious as a regular arthroscopic surgery on
the shoulder. They didn't have to cut muscle or a tendon or
anything like that. It's doing better than expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Since having surgery on May 4, Williams has been resting at his
Houston home.

<HEADLINE> British Firm Eyes Swissair Gem Hunt  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) -- The provincial government is
weighing a request by Lloyd's of London to search the Swissair
crash site for $300 million in diamonds and jewels reportedly
aboard the plane, according to news reports.
</P>
<P>
   The British firm, through a Canadian insurance company, has
asked the Nova Scotia government for permission to hunt for the
valuables, said CBC-TV, Canada's national broadcast network.
</P>
<P>
   Swissair Flight 111 crashed into the ocean just off Nova Scotia
on Sept. 2, 1998, killing all 229 passengers on board. The cause of
the crash still hasn't been determined.
</P>
<P>
   The plane's manifest indicates that 4{ pounds of diamonds and 11
pounds of jewelry were aboard when it went down. The valuables have
not been found.
</P>
<P>
   The reports said the insurance company plans to use a
mini-submarine to seek the gems among the wreckage, which lies in
about 200 feet of water.
</P>
<P>
   The diamonds were reportedly in a stainless steel tube, which
may have disintegrated on impact or been driven deep into the
seabed.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd's told CBC-TV last week that it hopes to begin the search
this summer. Lloyd's officials in London were unavailable for
comment Monday evening and calls to a spokesman's cell phone were
unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   Nova Scotia Natural Resources Minister Ernie Fage has said the
government will make a decision on whether to allow the search in a
couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Fage said he wouldn't rule out allowing it, adding that he will
consider concerns of family members.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Shaw, whose daughter died in the crash, argued before the
Nova Scotia legislature Friday that no one should be allowed to
''rake through'' the site. He said other relatives of the victims
also opposed the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Estabrooks, a member of the Nova Scotia legislature who
represents communities near the crash site, wants the province to
reject any treasure trove application ''because of the sacredness
of the site.''

<HEADLINE> Investigators looking at whether fuel was a factor in plane crash  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER NEWTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) -- Investigators on Monday were looking
into whether fuel problems caused both engines to fail aboard a
charter plane that crashed, killing all 19 people aboard. But the
probe was hampered because the cockpit voice recorder was not
working at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board investigators searched
for clues in the wreckage after Sunday's crash of the Executive
Airlines twin-engine turboprop, which was carrying 17 passengers
home from a gambling trip to Atlantic City, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The two pilots, who also were killed, had reported to air
traffic controllers that they lost both engines as they made their
second approach to the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton airport in the rain.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation analysts said dual-engine failures are rare and can
indicate a problem with the fuel supply.
</P>
<P>
   NTSB member George Black said investigators were ''looking at
fuel and fuel systems,'' including whether the fuel was
contaminated.
</P>
<P>
   However, Black said later that no evidence of contamination was
found in a preliminary test of the fuel from a truck in
Farmingdale, N.Y., that had refueled the plane. The tests were
continuing and would include a ground sample from the crash site.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators did not rule out that the plane could have been
low on fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Black also said the voice recorder had an improper power supply
and did not record any sounds in the cockpit. Plus, the plane did
not have the other type of ''black box'' recorder, the one that
takes down flight data such as speed and altitude, because it was
not required for the model of airplane, a Jetstream 31.
</P>
<P>
   ''This seriously hampers the investigation,'' Black said. ''This
is somewhat disappointing, and we're going to do the best we can
without it.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Monday, Black said the company had told the NTSB that the
recorder may have been specially modified to operate on the plane's
power source without the inverter. NTSB officials were
investigating that possibility, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said investigators will rely on the wreckage, witnesses,
radar data and conversations between the pilots and air traffic
controllers.
</P>
<P>
   Black said officials spent the late afternoon Monday
interviewing three people who heard the plane crash and another
person who saw it.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of the earwitnesses gave remarkably consistent
information, saying that there was a sound in the engines that
reflected an increase in power,'' Black said. ''The eyewitness said
the plane was level with its (landing) gear up when it disappeared
over the tree line.''
</P>
<P>
   The plane left Farmingdale on Sunday morning, picked up the
passengers about 10:30 a.m. in Atlantic City and then headed to
Wilkes-Barre for the one-hour, 150-mile flight.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Hartt, spokesman for the South Jersey Transportation
Authority, which operates the Atlantic City Airport, said the
aircraft received no fuel or repairs there. The director of the
airport in Farmingdale, Hugh Jones, referred all questions about
the plane to the NTSB.
</P>
<P>
   John Nance, an aviation analyst in Tacoma, Wash., said one
failed engine is a ''very rare event.''
</P>
<P>
   ''To have two fail simultaneously is simply beyond the realm of
probability,'' he said. ''What will cause two engines to stop
running simultaneously is an interruption in the fuel supply. It
could be some sort of catastrophic problem with the pumping system
or the plumbing of the fuel system.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Peragine, chief executive of the Farmingdale-based
Executive Airlines, said the company had never had problems with
the 12-year-old plane. He said the pilot had 8,500 hours of flight
time, ''a relatively high amount of time,'' and the co-pilot was
about to be upgraded to captain.
</P>
<P>
   ''These were two expert pilots and the machine was maintained to
the highest standards,'' Peragine said. ''You just don't have a
clue as to what could have possibly happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The plane went down about nine miles from the
Wilkes-Barre/Scranton airport at 11:48 a.m. Sunday. Black said the
plane might have missed its first approach because of bad weather.
It was raining, and visibility was poor.
</P>
<P>
   As investigators looked for clues, nearby communities mourned
the victims, who had gone to Atlantic City on Saturday afternoon on
the flight chartered by Caesars Atlantic City Hotel Casino.
</P>
<P>
   Debra Maleski lost her mother, Nancy Maleski, 66, of Moosic, and
sister Elaine Pilosi, 46. She said the casino chartered the flight
every other weekend from Wilkes-Barre.
</P>
<P>
   ''They just went for an evening of fun and excitement. They
played the slots,'' Maleski said. ''They didn't like to fly, either
one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents in the small communities near Wilkes-Barre waited for
the coroner to post the list of victims.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you don't know somebody, you know someone who knows them,''
said Jerry Mancinelli of Dallas, Pa. ''Everybody in the valley is
going to be touched.''

<HEADLINE> Notes From Monday's Games  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressAMERICAN LEAGUE:
White Sox-Blue Jays:
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO: The White Sox have lost just two of their last 10 games
at SkyDome. ... The White Sox are in the midst of a 38-game stretch
where they play 22 games against the New York Yankees and Cleveland
Indians. ... Frank Thomas went 6-for-13 in the series.
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: Toronto's last three wins have been in their last
at-bat. ... OF Todd Greene, released by the Anaheim Angels in
spring training, made his first appearance for Toronto. He went
1-for-3. .. Craig Grebeck has 15 hits in his last 38 at-bats. ...
Billy Koch is 9-for-12 in save opportunities.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Astros-Brewers:
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: The Astros were scheduled for two trips to Milwaukee,
both in the first seven weeks of the 2000 season. Rainouts last
week forced the team to return from a disappointing weekend in
Montreal, which swept the three-game series. ''Besides the fact
that we lost every game, what I'll remember is all the rain,''
manager Larry Dierker said as rain prevented batting practice prior
to Monday's doubleheader at County Stadium. ''You don't have to go
to South America to see the rain forest, just come up here. At
least it's not cold this time.'' ... Stuck in last place after
figuring to contend for the NL's Central Division title, Dierker
said it would be some feat to come back and win it. ''We've dug
this hole deep enough that we're now a longshot,'' he said. ''I
think we still could do it, but it's going to be hard.''
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: The Brewers optioned reliever Horacio Estrada (2-0,
6.63 ERA) to Triple-A Indianapolis and recalled P Rafael Roque, 4-2
with a 5.86 ERA in seven starts at Indianapolis. ... The Brewers
started the week with two hitters above the .300 mark in SS Mark
Loretta (.307) and 2B Ron Belliard (.302).
Reds-Dodgers:
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: Reliever Mark Wohlers, working his way back to the
majors from a torn ligament in his elbow -- and a severe bout with
wildness -- will throw live batting practice on Wednesday and is
expected to make his first rehab assignment on May 29 with Class A
Dayton. ''He's in a great frame of mind,'' Reds pitching coach Don
Gullett said. ''His mechanics now are as sound as they've ever
been, and he looks like the old Mark Wohlers when he was with
Atlanta. He's been throwing his split-finger and his slider for the
last couple of weeks, and the intensity is getting better. So we
anticipate him making a full recovery and helping the Cincinnati
Reds in the very near future.'' ... Denny Neagle carried a streak
of 10 consecutive winning decisions into Monday night's start
against the Dodgers. The streak spanned 16 starts. He was 12-2
since July 30 of last season, when he finished a stretch of more
than two months on the disabled list because of weakness in his
pitching shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: Trever Miller, the left-handed reliever whom the
Los Angeles Dodgers obtained on waivers from Philadelphia last
Friday, was activated on Monday and expressed joy over his change
of scenery. ''I love it,'' he said. ''This team has a very
legitimate chance of going to the playoffs and the World Series,
from what I've seen. In Philadelphia, we basically had no chance.
They're in such a hole right now, I don't think they can possible
find their way out of it. Maybe they can get back to .500 baseball,
but they're not going to go to the playoffs.'' The Phillies come to
Dodger Stadium on Friday for a three-game weekend series. ... CF
Devon White, who has been out since May 5 after partially tearing
his left rotator cuff while diving for a ball, was re-examined on
Monday. ''I think they were talking about giving him 30 days' rest
and then another MRI to see how the partial tear is coming,''
manager Davey Johnson said. ''Hopefully, it's going to be better.
And if it is, then he's probably past the point where they might
have to do something more drastic.'' ... Reliever Mike Fetters, who
hasn't pitched since May 3 because of a sore right elbow, showed no
adverse effects from his 50-pitch session in the bullpen on Sunday.
He is expected to throw again on Tuesday and be ready for duty on
Friday.
Mets-Padres:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: OF Melvin Mora began a rehabilitation assignment
Monday night with Triple-A Norfolk of the International League,
which started a four-game series with Pawtucket. Mora was placed on
the disabled list on May 13 with a cut on his right index finger.
He is eligible to come off the DL on May 28. ... 1B Todd Zeile got
the night off and Matt Franco got the start.
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: RHP Carlton Loewer pitched a three-inning simulated
game of about 60 pitches and did well, manager Bruce Bochy said.
He'll probably throw on the side once more and then begin a rehab
assignment on Friday. Loewer began the season on the disabled list
with a broken left ankle suffered when he fell out of a deer blind
while hunting in January. ... The Padres signed RHP Carlos Reyes to
a minor league contract and assigned him to Triple-A Las Vegas.
Reyes returns to the Padres' organization for the third time. He
was with Philadelphia earlier this year. ... 3B Phil Nevin was
named NL Player of the Week after hitting .667 (14-for-21) with
three doubles, a triple and four homers, including his first career
grand slam. He drove in 14 runs and scored seven runs. ... RF Tony
Gwynn was back in the lineup after sitting out two games due to his
troublesome left knee.

   MALIBU, Calif. (AP) -- Top-seeded Marissa Irvin of Stanford
defeated Michelle Faucher of Texas 6-3, 1-6, 6-2 in the first round
of NCAA tournament singles play at Pepperdine on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin rallied in the third set to avoid an upset loss.
</P>
<P>
   ''I started out the match well and then had a mental lapse in

<HEADLINE> Lindros Cleared To Rejoin Flyers  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Whether his teammates want him back or not,
Eric Lindros is returning to practice with the Philadelphia Flyers
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros, the Flyers' banished captain who has had two
concussions in the past three months, was cleared Monday to
practice with the team. Hours later, the Flyers lost 4-1 to New
Jersey in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference finals and had their
lead in the best-of-seven series cut to 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia can close out the Devils with a victory in Game 6
Wednesday night at Continental Airlines Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know that he's ready for that,'' Flyers interim coach
Craig Ramsay said after Monday's loss. ''He's cleared for practice;
doesn't mean he's ready for the game. We'll see how it goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindros suggested last week that one day of practice will not be
enough to get him in game shape.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros flew to Chicago on Monday afternoon to see concussion
specialist Dr. James Kelly, who has been treating him and issuing
workout guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers issued a statement during the first period of Monday
night's game saying only that Lindros was examined by Kelly and
cleared to participate in full team practices.
</P>
<P>
   There has been speculation whether Lindros' return would be
viewed as a positive or negative for the team that is one win from
the Stanley Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he's ready to go, he's ready to go,'' forward Rick Tocchet
said after Monday's game. ''If Eric is ready to play and wants to
play, how can that be a distraction?''
</P>
<P>
   Lindros returned to the ice last Tuesday for the first time
since sustaining his third concussion of the year earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
   During his most recent workouts, Lindros was able to skate with
another player and a goalie in non-contact drills.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros hasn't played since March 13 because of a concussion
suffered nine days earlier from a check by Boston's Hal Gill.
</P>
<P>
   After criticizing the team's medical staff for failing to
diagnose that concussion, he was stripped of his captaincy in favor
of Eric Desjardins.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros' latest concussion came at practice on May 4. He needed
20 stitches in his lip after colliding with Francis Lessard of the
AHL's Philadelphia Phantoms during a drill.
</P>

   ''For him to come back will be a great help,'' defenseman Luke
Richardson said. ''It's a plus, but we had to put in our minds at
the beginning of the playoffs that we weren't going to have him.''

<HEADLINE> Fiji Leader Eyes Hostage Crisis End  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- In an attempt to bring armed rebels occupying
Parliament closer to surrender, Fiji's president said Monday that
the current government might be replaced even if the coup attempt
fails.
</P>
<P>
   President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara's comments appeared to be a
conciliatory sign to indigenous Fijian rebels, who have been
holding government officials hostage since storming Parliament on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting that Mara said he expected would help end the
crisis, indigenous tribal chiefs from across Fiji met Tuesday
outside the capital of Suva.
</P>
<P>
   Police and soldiers cordoned off the meeting of the Great
Council of Chiefs -- the supreme body of indigenous Fijian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Mahendra Chaudhry, Fiji's first prime minister of Indian
descent, is among the hostages in this South Pacific country where
ethnic tensions have been building in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Mara said that he would hold talks with the democratically
elected government once the coup attempt ends.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will have a dialogue and see what they offer,'' he said.
''I cannot say I will put back the government that has caused all
these problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Sitiveni Rabuka, the president of the council, said he
supported Mara.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Chaudhry's position ''now is untenable,'' Rabuka
said. ''If he feels for the country and he sees the demonstrations
and the destruction, he might feel that he wants to step down.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabuka, who led two coups and ruled for 12 years, said he
supports the aims of the armed rebels holding more than 20 Cabinet
ministers and lawmakers hostage, ''but not their methods.''
</P>
<P>
   Rebel leader George Speight on Monday renewed a threat to harm
the hostages if an armed rescue mission was mounted, reversing a
safety guarantee he gave Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''If anyone enters the barriers of this complex with the view to
free them (the hostages) we will not hesitate,'' he said. ''Their
safety is conditional upon everybody staying out of this place.''
</P>
<P>
   Speight confirmed earlier reports that rebels had taken Chaudhry
outside into the grounds of parliament at gunpoint. He said it was
in response to an alleged attempt by an unknown group to enter the
compound.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said no rescue mission had been launched.
</P>
<P>
   Speight claims Chaudhry's year-old coalition discriminated
against indigenous Fijians. Tensions have been rising between the
indigenous people and the descendants of Indian migrants, who
dominate commerce in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Mara sent a letter to Speight on Sunday night promising to
address concerns of ethnic Fijians and pledging that ''the position
of the indigenous community will be protected and enhanced.''
</P>
<P>
   Fijians of Indian descent make up about 44 percent of Fiji's
population of 813,000, while indigenous Fijians account for 51
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The president said he had a plan to end the standoff, which
would be presented Tuesday to the Great Council of Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our main objective is to see that no blood is spilled,'' Mara
said.
</P>
<P>
   Speight said he would ''retire'' if the council doesn't back his
coup attempt. Local media also reported he said he would release
his hostages if the council orders it.
</P>
<P>
   The failed businessman declared himself prime minister after
storming parliament with seven gunmen and swearing in a replacement
government.
</P>
<P>
   Police on Monday tightened security around Suva's parliament
complex, stopping news crews at checkpoints and searching vans
delivering food and other supplies.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Stanley Roth urged Fiji to
reinstall its democratically elected government and said if the
chiefs did not, the U.S. relationship with Fiji would deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
   ''This meeting could play a major positive role in leading
toward a resolution of this crisis and the preservation of the
constitutionally elected government,'' Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the government were to be toppled by force, U.S. law would
require policy changes and again put the relationship on a downward
path and I think, the biggest losers would be the people of Fiji.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, New Zealand Foreign Minister Phil Goff announced
the United Nations was sending the head of the U.N. administration
in East Timor, Sergio Vieira de Mello, to Fiji to mediate in the
crisis.

<HEADLINE> Officials Don't Agree On Nazi Fund  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. and German negotiators failed on Monday
to finish work on a system to compensate Nazi-era slave laborers,
complicating plans for President Clinton to sign an agreement
during his upcoming visit to Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Treasury Secretary Stuart Eizenstat and head German
negotiator Otto Lambsdorff worked for several hours on the plan,
which would set up a German foundation to pay claims to former
forced and slave laborers as well as some other Holocaust victims.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is to travel to Berlin the first week of June, and
negotiators had hoped a completed agreement could be signed then by
him and Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   But Eizenstat said another round of negotiations by a small
working group would be held in Berlin on May 31 and a session with
the wider group of negotiators would be held in late June.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am hopeful that we will resolve all remaining issues and
plan a concluding ... session late in June,'' Eizenstat said.
</P>
<P>
   A number of issues remain to be worked out, including one wanted
by German companies to preclude further lawsuits against them in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   German businesses suggested the foundation after several
class-action suits were brought against them in the United States.
The German government and industry agreed to come up with $5
billion for the fund under the condition that further suits will
not be entertained in U.S. courts.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement has been under negotiation for more than a year by
the two nations, German industry, five Central and Eastern European
countries where the majority of survivors live, Israel, lawyers
from the class action suits and other representatives of survivors.
At times there have been some 90 people involved in negotiating
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We certainly remain optimistic that this will be signed in the
near future,'' said Gideon Taylor, executive vice president of the
Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, one of the
negotiating groups.

<HEADLINE> Mistakes Prove Costly For Flyers  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Flyers got sloppy and the
New Jersey Devils got back in the series.
</P>
<P>
   With history on its side, Philadelphia failed to close out New
Jersey on Monday night and let momentum shift back to the Devils in
the Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey capitalized on crucial miscues and beat the Flyers
4-1 in Game 5 to cut Philadelphia's lead in the best-of-seven
series to 3-2. Game 6 is Wednesday at the Continental Airlines
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ''They won every battle.'' Flyers forward Rick Tocchet said.
''They had stuff we never gave them before, 2-on-1 breaks,
breakaways. They played smart and we didn't adjust. We kept making
the same mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey scored its first goal when the Flyers failed to clear
the puck on a power play despite several opportunities to ice it.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Arnott blasted a shot past Brian Boucher two seconds
before Kent Manderville left the penalty box for a 1-0 lead midway
through the first period.
</P>
<P>
   ''I should've cleared the puck. It was my mistake,'' forward
Valeri Zelepukin said.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Holik made it 2-0 five minutes later when Keith Primeau
couldn't control an errant outlet pass, setting up an odd-man rush.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher was helpless as Holik broke in with Jay Pandolfo and
Vladimir Malakhov. It was the first time in the series that either
team took a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our players were trying to create something and none of it
worked,'' Flyers interim coach Craig Ramsay said. ''It was one of
those nights. We tried some things that didn't work and when you
fall behind, you try a little more. Nothing worked for us.''
</P>
<P>
   After a nifty goal by Zelepukin cut it to 3-1 late in the second
period, New Jersey regained its three-goal lead following a
giveaway by John LeClair less than a minute into the third.
</P>
<P>
   LeClair's errant pass in neutral ice went right to Patrik Elias,
who skated in and beat Boucher between the pads with a backhander.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did a poor job of forcing the puck through the neutral
zone,'' LeClair said. ''We did a lot of things we said we couldn't
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Twelve teams in the last 12 years have come back from a 3-1
deficit to win a playoff series, but all 12 teams did it in the
first round.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen teams in NHL history have come back from either a 3-1 or
3-0 deficit, but none have done it since the NHL expanded in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time New Jersey has forced a sixth game after
trailing 3-1. The Devils fell behind 3-1 twice before and lost both
series in five.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think they were ever out of the series,'' defenseman
Dan McGillis said. ''They're not going to lay down and die.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, New Jersey has never come back from a 3-2 deficit either.
The Devils are 0-4 when trailing 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whatever we did tonight is great, but it's over and it doesn't
mean anything,'' Holik said. ''The game on Wednesday is our
season.''

<HEADLINE> N.Orleans Cemetery Trial Begins  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Two prominent antiques dealers and one of
their customers are on trial, accused of putting in orders for
thefts of sculptures, urns and benches from ornate above-ground
tombs.
</P>
<P>
   Four thieves have pleaded guilty and will be sentenced after Roy
Boucvalt, owner of the Boucvalt House, and antiques dealers Aaron
Jarabica and Peter Patout have been tried. All three are charged
with conspiracy and theft.
</P>
<P>
   Jury selection began Monday in Criminal District Court.
</P>
<P>
   Boucvalt, Jarabica and Patout all deny knowing that any of the
art was stolen. Their lawyers have said their clients were set up
by thieves hoping to reduce their sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say the theft scheme stretched as far as Los Angeles
and New York, where some of the $800,000 in stolen items were
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   The thieves were caught in 1998, after a worker jotted down the
license number of a van cruising among the rows of tombs at Lake
Lawn Metairie Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   The cemetery is one of the fanciest in the city. Some of the
tombs are built like tiny chapels. One is a pyramid, with a small
sphinx in front. Another is a miniature cathedral.

<HEADLINE> Security in South Lebanon Is Shaky  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE COPANS
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel (AP) -- Fearful that an outbreak of
fighting in south Lebanon would spill over into reprisal attacks,
tens of thousands of northern Israelis hastily gathered up
children, food and schoolbooks as the army ordered them into
underground bomb shelters Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's security Cabinet held a late-night emergency session,
and Israel radio reported that the ministers decided to hasten
Israel's retreat from Lebanon -- initially due to be completed by
July 7. Prime Minister Ehud Barak's spokesman, Gadi Baltiansky,
refused to comment on the report and the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   During the night the Israeli army began evacuating its second
biggest base in south Lebanon. Convoys of trucks brought weapons,
equipment and scores of soldiers across the border from the Bint
Jebeil base.
</P>
<P>
   The rapidly deteriorating situation in south Lebanon -- including
concern that Israel's allied militia could be lurching toward
collapse -- had brought calls from some to expedite Israel's troop
pullout from the zone in south Lebanon where it has had a military
presence for the past 22 years.
</P>
<P>
   Haim Ramon, a Cabinet minister and confidant of Barak, said at
the meeting that he hoped the pullout would be ''much earlier''
than the deadline Israel imposed on itself in July.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon also told Israel's Channel 2 that once the troops are out
of Lebanon, Israel will feel far less constrained in terms of
reprisals if it is attacked.
</P>
<P>
   ''Up until now ... we could not react as we are capable of
doing, using the full power of the (army),'' he said. ''The rules
of the game are changing.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel beefed up defenses on its northern border -- army tank
transporters were seen Monday night on the road leading north -- and
warned that attacks on either its troops or its northern
communities would bring harsh reprisals, not limited to the battle
zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ''If someone initiates attacks on Israeli soldiers, not to
mention the settlements of the north, as we withdraw ... the
response will be very painful,'' said Barak, speaking in the border
town of Zarit. ''I don't recommend to anyone in the area to provoke
a response from Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   At daybreak Tuesday, small convoys of Israeli troops were seen
driving from Lebanon to the Israeli side of the border.
</P>
<P>
   At one crossing, just north of the border town of Metullah,
three tanks rolled across the frontier. In another area, soldiers
from the Golani Brigade waved their banner and honked horns of
jeeps.
</P>
<P>
   In Kiryat Shemona, the principal border town, loudspeakers
blared orders to head into shelters after word came that two
Lebanese civilians had been killed in the occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
   In a crowded market, people grabbed their groceries and hurried
off. Even youngsters like 12-year-old Efrat Ohana knew enough to
take cover quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was on the way home from school, and as my mother taught me,
I ran with my bag to the shelter in the building and waited for my
parents to come home from work,'' she said calmly.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic heading south was heavy as some northerners opted to
flee out of rocket range rather than spend a night in shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Barak repeated Monday that Israel's troop pullout would be
completed by its self-imposed deadline of July 7, but said the
exact date will be decided ''according to ... Israel's
considerations.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those considerations is the state of Israel's allied
militia, the South Lebanon Army, elements of which appear to be
sliding into a state of chaos. Over the past few days, SLA
militiamen have been abandoning outposts, deserting by the dozens
and seeking shelter in Israel, apparently fearing for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   With the pullback of the SLA, sympathizers of the Shiite Muslim
Hezbollah guerrillas have in the past two days taken over a dozen
villages, giving the guerrillas a foothold close by the Israeli
border.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, five SLA men -- all senior officers, according to
Israel radio -- crossed over into Israel near the communal farm of
Milkhia to plead for asylum for themselves and dozens of relatives.
Israel has promised to provide shelter to fleeing militiamen and
their families.
</P>
<P>
   SLA men remaining in Lebanon after the pullout face the threat
of reprisals from Hezbollah, which led the fight to drive out
Israel, and from the Lebanese government, which considers the SLA
troops traitors and has sentenced some officers to death in
absentia.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli daily Maariv, in Monday's editions, said senior
Israeli military officers had ''great doubt'' as to whether the SLA
could continue to function.
</P>
<P>
   So rife was speculation about a speeded-up withdrawal timetable
that the Defense Ministry issued a statement explicitly denying
there was any order to pull out on June 1.
</P>
<P>
   Worry is growing about SLA-abandoned weaponry falling into the
hands of Hezbollah. On Monday, Israeli warplanes destroyed an SLA
artillery battery in the central area of the occupied zone after it
was abandoned by its crew, the army said.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials said it had been known all along that a
unilateral pullout from south Lebanon -- without any guarantees from
Lebanon that it would prevent guerrilla attacks -- might not go
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   Asked on Israel TV whether the situation had spun out of
control, Israel's justice minister, Yossi Beilin, said: ''Anyone
who spoke about withdrawal without an agreement understood it would
be a withdrawal without rice being thrown at soldiers, and would
not be simple.''

<HEADLINE> SLA Judge Threatens Sanctions  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A judge threatened a retired policeman's
lawyer with sanctions for openly filing a lawsuit against a woman
accused of attempting to kill officers with pipe bombs in a 1975
Symbionese Liberation Army plot.
</P>
<P>
   With a gag order issued in the case against Sara Jane Olson,
Superior Court Judge James M. Ideman told attorney Bradley Gage
Monday that he should have filed the lawsuit under seal.
</P>
<P>
   Ideman called the filing ''a breathtaking act of chutzpah.''
</P>
<P>
   Gage said he believed he followed the judge's order barring
lawyers and witnesses from speaking about the case outside court.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit by former Officer James Bryan claims Olson planted
bombs under his patrol car while he and his partner were eating at
a restaurant 25 years ago. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages
for emotional distress.
</P>
<P>
   The criminal case against Olson, 53, alleges pipe bombs were
planted under Bryan's car and another police car as revenge for the
deaths of six SLA members in a shootout with police. The bombs did
not go off.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly known as Kathleen Ann Soliah, Olson was arrested last
year in St. Paul, Minn. She had married a doctor, had three
children and was active in her community.

<HEADLINE> Devils Player Bloodied After Check  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- New Jersey Devils center Sergei Nemchinov
needed 40 stitches after he was bloodied early in the second period
of Monday night's Game 5 of the Eastern Conference finals when he
was checked into the boards and struck a metal partition with his
head.
</P>
<P>
   Nemchinov was skating near the penalty box when Philadelphia's
John LeClair drove him into the boards with a forearm. The glass
shook, and before it could settle back into place Nemchinov ran
into the metal support.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving on-ice treatment, Nemchinov, with a bloody towel
covering his face, was able to skate off under his own power. A
Devils spokesman said Nemchinov took the stitches to the left side
of his head.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody wants to see anybody get hurt,'' LeClair said. ''The
glass kind of split on him.''
</P>
<P>
   LeClair had his own bloody moment in Game 3 when he was struck
in the face by the stick of Devils goalie Martin Brodeur. LeClair,
who was hit near his eye as Brodeur followed through on a clearing
attempt, needed 39 stitches.
</P>
<P>
   ''You hate to see things like that,'' Devils defenseman Ken
Daneyko said. ''It's a scary thing when you see players go down
like that. We've seen a lot of that this series. There's no love
lost out there. Guys are playing hard on both sides and that's
playoff hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   LeClair has worn a partial face shield the past two games and
has not missed any action, despite a large area of discoloration
outside the eye and redness inside.
</P>
<P>
   ''John LeClair is as tough and honest a player as I've played
against,'' Daneyko said. ''I think he was even concerned, but
that's playoff hockey. It's the Eastern Conference finals and guys
are playing hard and seems like guys are going down like flies.''

<HEADLINE> Castro Meets With German Minister  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Fidel Castro met with Germany's minister for
development aid late Monday, after she spent much of her four-day
visit here explaining the benefits Cuba would enjoy by joining a
trade group of developing nations tied to the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Castro personally greeted Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul upon her
arrival for a 9:30 p.m. meeting at his offices at the Council of
State, the head of Cuba's communist government.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have tried to persuade, to convince the Cuban side of the
utility'' of subscribing to a EU trade pact with African, Caribbean
and Pacific countries, said Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul. Joining the
ACP group could be ''an important component'' in relations between
Cuba and European nations, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In comments carried earlier in the day by Cuban state media,
Vice President Carlos Lage indicated that he at least listened.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am convinced that relations will get better'' between Cuba
and the EU, Lage said after meeting late Sunday with
Wieczorek-Zeul, the island's Prensa Latina news agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Relations soured last month when Cuba canceled a visit here by a
senior EU delegation after European nations supported a motion that
condemned Havana at the U.N. Human Rights Commission. The talks in
Cuba had been expected to focus on plans to develop trade ties
between Cuba and the 15-nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, Cuba withdrew its request to join the ACP
group of 71 African, Caribbean and Pacific nations who benefit from
favored trade and aid ties with the EU under the 1975 Lome
convention.

<HEADLINE> Detroit Drops Larry Murphy's Option  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- The Detroit Red Wings have chosen not to exercise
a $3 million team option on veteran defenseman Larry Murphy's
contract for next season.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a case of economics, as it is the case in professional
sports often these days,'' general manager Ken Holland, who wants
to work out a less expensive deal, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, 39, had 10 goals and 30 assists in 81 games during the
regular season. He added two goals and three assists in the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy earned $2.5 million this season. He would become an
unrestricted free agent July 1 if he doesn't come to terms with the
Wings.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like to have Larry Murphy play for us,'' Holland, who
will meet with Murphy later this week, told The Detroit News for a
story Tuesday. ''I think he can help our team. Hopefully, we'll be
able to work something out.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy was unavailable for comment Monday.

   ''In addition to a couple of other NBA possibilities, he's also
considering a major college coaching position in the Big 10,'' Ades
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ades did not identify the Big 10 school, other than to say that
it is ''a step up from St. John's in terms of stature'' and that
talks have already begun. There are no current openings at any of
the Big 10 schools.
</P>
<P>
   While Ades said Jarvis and Jordan were not able to come to
financial terms for the Wizards job, Jarvis was also concerned
about the amount of authority he would have working under Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, the Wizards president of basketball operations, had been
talking to Jarvis since last week but on Sunday he gave an
indication that the St. John's coach was not the only candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of other candidates just as qualified,''
Jordan said Sunday of Jarvis. ''He's one of the guys who's
interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Wizards officials were unavailable for comment Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis' withdrawal leaves just one known candidate, veteran NBA
coach Lenny Wilkens, who interviewed with Jordan two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis has coached two seasons at St. John's, leading the Red
Storm to a 53-17 record and two appearances in the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like to express my appreciation to the Wizards
organization, especially Michael Jordan, for their interest,''
Jarvis said. ''I would also like to thank the president of St.
John's, Father Donald Harrington, athletic director Edward Manetta
Jr. and our loyal fans for their support and understanding in this
process.''
</P>
<P>
   It was reported last week that Jarvis had been offered the job,
a fact he and Jordan denied.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am delighted that Mike is staying with us,'' Harrington
said. ''He has been in regular contact throughout the process and I
was more than willing to support Mike and (his wife) Connie and
their decision whatever it may have been. I consider St. John's
blessed that they will continue to enhance our university
community.''

<HEADLINE> Peaceful Israel Pullout Hopes Dim  </HEADLINE>
By HUSSEIN DAKROUB
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIT YAHOUN, Lebanon (AP) -- South Lebanon was in chaos Monday
after units of an Israeli-allied militia abandoned their positions
and Shiite Muslim guerrillas -- and their supporters rushed in to
reclaim villages held by Israeli forces for two decades. Six
civilians were killed in the violence.
</P>
<P>
   Frightened Israeli-allied militiamen surrendered en masse or
sought asylum in Israel as hopes dimmed for an orderly, peaceful
pullout overseen by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of a key section of the front line puts Shiite
Muslim guerrillas on Israel's doorstep and could hasten the
withdrawal of the remaining Israeli troops in the occupied zone
ahead of their self-imposed July 7 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid developments -- eight villages were reclaimed by
guerrillas and sympathizers on Monday and six on Sunday -- drew a
warning from Israel that it could send its troops back into Lebanon
to keep the guerrillas out.
</P>
<P>
   Some units of the 2,500-member Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army
militia were in disarray and loyal militiamen were retreating to
their villages near the border to organize new defensive lines.
</P>
<P>
   Early Tuesday, the Israeli army began evacuating its second
biggest base in south Lebanon. Convoys of trucks brought weapons,
equipment and scores of soldiers across the border from the Bint
Jebeil base.
</P>
<P>
   Small convoys of Israeli soldiers began arriving inside Israel
later as soldiers in tanks and jeeps honked horns, waved brigade
banners and kissed the soil of their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've made it,'' one soldier shouted. Another soldier kissed
the ground. One officer carried a Torah scroll.
</P>
<P>
   The evacuation came after Israel's security Cabinet held a
late-night emergency session, and Israel radio reported that the
ministers decided to hasten Israel's retreat from Lebanon --
initially due to be completed by July 7. Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's spokesman, Gadi Baltiansky, refused to comment on the
report and the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Before that meeting, Haim Ramon, a Cabinet minister and
confident of Barak, said he hoped a complete pullout would come
''much earlier'' than July 7, enabling the army to engage in a
broader range of reprisals.
</P>
<P>
   ''Up until now ... we could not react as we are capable of
doing, using the full power of the (army),'' he said. ''The rules
of the game are changing.''
</P>
<P>
   Some in Israel painted Monday's events as an ominous takeover of
the area by Hezbollah guerrillas. Israel set up the zone in 1985 to
protect its border region from guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In northern Israel, the army beefed up border defenses and tens
of thousands of civilians, fearing reprisal attacks, hastily
gathered up children, food and schoolbooks as the army ordered them
into underground bomb shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, thousands of Lebanese converged on the reclaimed
villages in Lebanon in cars, trucks and on foot, many waving flags
of the Shiite guerrilla groups Hezbollah and Amal. They were
showered with rice and rose petals by the few remaining villagers
who emerged to welcome them.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a great day and I can't express my happiness,'' said
Qassem Rammal, who lived with his wife in Adaisseh, a half mile
from the Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
   The takeover was peaceful at first, with little resistance from
the Israeli allied militiamen.
</P>
<P>
   But it turned bloody when battle tanks fired artillery shells
and an Israeli helicopter gunship strafed the area, apparently in
an effort to scare away the approaching civilians.
</P>
<P>
   It was not known immediately who or what caused the Lebanese
casualties -- the tanks and howitzers on the ground, which both
Israel and its militia allies have, or the gunship, which only
Israel has.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli army in Jerusalem said the civilians were
''apparently killed by SLA fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli warplanes and artillery also attacked an abandoned SLA
artillery battery to prevent it from falling into guerrilla hands,
the Israeli army said. It said Israeli navy ships in the
Mediterranean Sea also took part, launching missiles toward
''terrorist targets.''
</P>
<P>
   Lebanese officials said two people were killed during aerial and
ground firing toward crowds between the villages of Houla and Meiss
el-Jabal. Two more civilians were killed by an artillery shell that
hit a former SLA position in the village of Rshaf. A fifth civilian
was killed by machine gun fire in the village Rob Thalatheen, and
the sixth died in shelling on the village of Srobbine.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital officials in Tibnine near Beit Yahoun, about 15 miles
from the sea, said 19 wounded were admitted from various villages.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, the Israeli army said three SLA fighters were
wounded. It added a number of rockets and mortars were fired into
Israel in the morning and around midday and Israeli planes and
helicopters repeatedly attacked ''terrorist targets'' in south
Lebanon during the day.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's events began when some 500 civilians waving Hezbollah
flags entered the village of Houla, about a mile from the Israeli
border, witnesses said. Hundreds of others converged on Markaba,
Tallousa, Rob Thalatheen, Baraachit, Bani Hayan, Adaisseh and Beit
Yahoun.
</P>
<P>
   When the marchers, who included bands of armed guerrillas,
reached Houla, the last nine SLA militiamen in the village deserted
their posts and defected to the Lebanese government, officials
said. Earlier Monday, other militiamen had retreated further into
the occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
   Timur Goksel, spokesman for the U.N. peacekeeping force in south
Lebanon, who has spent the last two decades in the region, said the
SLA had ''ceased to exist as a unified force.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called for
additional peacekeepers to be sent in to confirm Israel's
withdrawal. Diplomats said, however, that with events moving so
quickly, there may not be enough time.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis and their militia allies have departed from
virtually all Shiite areas except Bint Jbeil, the last main Shiite
town in the hands of the SLA and the Israeli army and home to 4,000
people.
</P>
<P>
   That cuts Israel's so-called security zone in half, with the SLA
retaining their headquarters in the Christian town of Marjayoun in
the eastern sector but unable to travel to the western sector,
where only a few posts adjacent to the border remain in Israeli
hands, except through Israel.
</P>
<P>
   SLA militiamen patrolled the streets in armored personnel
carriers and set up checkpoints Monday in Marjayoun, which has a
population of about 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 SLA militiamen surrendered to Lebanese army
checkpoints at Beit Yahoun on Monday, Lebanese officials said. They
were hauled into five Lebanese army trucks, which drove them away
as crowds at the checkpoint threw stones at them.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, 46 SLA militiamen defected from three main towns in
the same area, joining hundreds of residents who returned home,
many for the first time since Israel set up the zone in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   President Emile Lahoud, speaking on television, said those who
cooperated with Israel will be held accountable. Lebanese law
punishes collaboration with Israel with jail terms and even death.

<HEADLINE> Actors' Guild Takes Aim at Powell  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The striking Screen Actors Guild was at war
Monday with Colin Powell over the non-union production of a public
service announcement for the retired general's youth charity.
</P>
<P>
   The spot for America's Promise, The Alliance For Youth, began
filming in Maryland on Sunday, and SAG vowed to picket the
production in which Powell was scheduled to take part Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   SAG President William Daniels sent a letter to Powell last week
calling on him ''as a man of great integrity, who is a role model
for so many Americans'' to join in honoring the 3-week-old strike
by commercial actors.
</P>
<P>
   Powell and the group he has led for three years, however, were
not changing their plans, according to Matt Lauer, a spokesman for
America's Promise in Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've invested a lot of resources into this effort and we had
a deadline,'' Lauer said. The spot is to be unveiled at the June 26
National Community Service Conference in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   SAG and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists,
which represent about 135,000 actors, authorized the work stoppage
beginning May 1. The unions want to change the ad industry's pay
structure for commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Some sports celebrities are observing the strike, such as golf's
top player, Tiger Woods. He canceled a Nike commercial shoot
shortly after the job action started.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the National Football League Players Association
urged its members to avoid non-union commercial production, SAG
said, joining the players' unions for major league baseball and the
National Basketball Association.
