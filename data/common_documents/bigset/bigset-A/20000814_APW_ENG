Gore Would Seek Clinton's Advice
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- At the very moment he is trying to emerge from President
Clinton's shadow, Vice President Al Gore said Sunday he would not hesitate to
seek Clinton's counsel if he succeeds him. ''Why would I rule that out?'' Gore
said in an interview with The Associated Press. The vice president, battling
Republican attempts to shackle him to Clinton's personal scandals, also said he
would serve his own term in the Oval Office ''according to the highest values.''
Gore spoke on the eve of Clinton's valedictory Monday night to the Democratic
National Convention in Los Angeles.

   SPARTA, N.J. (AP) -- Residents of two northern New Jersey towns were
evacuated Sunday and others were put on alert in the wake of torrential
downpours that washed out bridges and roads, broke through a dam and prompted
fears of mudslides. Officials estimated that Saturday's downpour, which dumped
more than 14 inches of rain on the area around Sparta, caused hundreds of
million of dollars in damage.

Koreas Reopen Border Liaisons

   PANMUNJOM, South Korea (AP) -- North and South Korea reopened border liaison
offices Monday, four years after they were closed because of political tensions.
Relations between the two Koreas have warmed significantly since their leaders
held a historic summit in Pyongyang, the North's capital, in June. In follow-up
talks by their deputies in Seoul two weeks ago, the Koreas agreed to reopen the
border liaison offices. The liaison offices first opened in 1992 to work as
government channels of dialogue. They closed four years later after a dispute
over a North Korean submarine that washed ashore in South Korea.

Paraguay VP Vote Too Close To Call
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) -- Paraguay's vote for a successor to its slain vice
president appeared extremely close Sunday, with early returns giving the
opposition candidate a slim lead over the late politician's son. The special,
one-office election is seen by the opposition as a chance to diminish the power
of the Colorado Party, which has ruled this South American country for 53 years.
The post of vice president has been empty since Luis Argana was gunned down in
the street in March 1999.

Ford: Tires Made During Strike
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Many of the 6.5 million Firestone tires being
recalled were made during a strike at the company's Decatur, Ill., plant, Ford
Motor Co. said Sunday. The tires are under investigation in hundreds of crashes
that caused at least 46 deaths. Ford conducted an analysis of its Firestone
tires and the complaints it had received to pin down where the tires were made.
The number of complaints was 10 times higher for the 15-inch ATX tires made in
Decatur than for the Wilderness tires, said Jason Vines, Ford's vice president
of communications. At the time, union workers at the plant were on strike, and
the plant was operating with replacement workers and managers.
Bridgestone/Firestone said the strike had nothing to do with the problems.

Cloning Pioneers End Pig Research
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The creators of Dolly the Sheep are halting their research
into genetically modifying pigs for human organ transplants, one of the
scientists said Sunday. The decision is motivated in part by fears that
transplanting animal organs into people could unleash deadly new viruses among
the human population. California-based Geron Bio-Med, which owns exclusive
rights to biotechnology developed by Edinburgh's Roslin Institute -- where Dolly
was created -- has decided to cut funding for the work, said Ian Wilmut, leader
of the team that created Dolly, the first clone made from an adult animal.

   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- As the new kid on the block, the Linux computer
operating system once had few friends besides the stereotypical technology geek
whose idea of fun was spending hours rewriting software code. But as that same

become part of the in crowd -- and an increasing threat to Microsoft Corp.'s
Windows monopoly. As the third annual LinuxWorld Conference &AMP; Expo opens this
week here, companies such as Hewlett-Packard are joining Dell Computer and IBM
Corp. in designating Linux a ''strategic'' operating system as each works to
gain market share in the high-end server computer market.

   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Roger Clemens pitched four-hit ball for 6 2-3 innings
Sunday night, winning his sixth straight decision as the New York Yankees beat
the Anaheim Angels 4-1. The Yankees managed two runs off rookie right-hander
Ramon Ortiz on a bases-loaded walk and a balk to salvage the finale of the

<HEADLINE> 1 Killed, 3 Hurt in L.A. Car Heist  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- One bystander was killed and three others
were wounded in a Sunday afternoon shootout between an armored car
guard and two gunmen outside a busy Costco food court, police said.
</P>
<P>
   One suspect was shot in the leg and was in custody, and police
were searching for one other gunman believed to be carrying
automatic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The guard was returning from the store when a gunman approached
him and gunfire erupted, Lt. Jim Grayson said.
</P>
<P>
   A second gunman in the outdoor food court also began shooting as
the guard raced into the armored car for protection, police said.
The guard was uninjured, and the gunmen fled empty-handed in a
white van with police pursuing.
</P>
<P>
   The van stopped several blocks from the store where police
captured one man who was taken to an area hospital. That man was
shot in the leg either mistakenly by the other gunman or by an
armored car guard, police said. The second guman ran away.
</P>
<P>
   ''It all happened really fast. It was loud,'' said Carlos
Barboza, who was at the store when the attack occurred about 3 p.m.
''I saw one guy carrying a machine gun, and he was turning around
shooting at people left and right.''
</P>
<P>
   Barboza said he saw one man shot in the head, another shot in
the back and a woman shot in the leg.
</P>
<P>
   ''At first it started at odd intervals, then ... it was like
bang, bang, bang,'' said Chris Forbess, a mechanic at a nearby Pep
Boys store. ''They were shooting as fast as they can.''

<HEADLINE> Arafat Arrives in Beijing For Talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat visited China on
Monday to brief Chinese leaders on the failed Middle East peace
summit and his plans to declare an independent Palestinian state on
Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   A Chinese vice foreign minister, Ji Peiding, and a crowd of Arab
ambassadors greeted Arafat on his arrival early Monday at Beijing's
airport.
</P>
<P>
   During his one-day visit, Arafat was to meet President Jiang
Zemin to convey his impression of last month's summit and to
discuss a possible unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state
next month, said Moustapha Saphariny, the Palestinian ambassador in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat repeatedly has said he will declare an independent state
Sept. 13, the deadline for a final Israeli-Palestinian peace
agreement
</P>
<P>
   At the Camp David summit, Israel offered the Palestinians
limited control over parts of east Jerusalem, but Arafat held firm
on Palestinians' demand for full sovereignty over the traditionally
Arab area.
</P>
<P>
   China in 1988 became the first major power to establish ties
with the Palestine Liberation Organization and it provided
financial and military assistance to the PLO.
</P>
<P>
   China, however, also has a warming relationship with Israel,
from which it buys arms.

<HEADLINE> Marine Band Marks 200th Anniversary  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- On an August afternoon 200 summers ago, Marine
bandsmen in blue-trimmed red coats mustered on a hill overlooking
the Potomac River, lifted their instruments and began an enduring
musical tradition.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Band's director, Lt. Col. Timothy W. Foley, says no
record remains of that first concert, conducted by Drum Major
William Farr. Nor does anyone know the precise size of Farr's band.
It is known that by December 1800 the band included two oboes, two
clarinets, two French horns, a bassoon and a drum.
</P>
<P>
   ''They almost certainly played 'Hail Columbia,''' Foley said.
''It used to be called ''The President's March'' and it was played
at George Washington's first inaugural. It was extremely popular
just about 1800.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Hail Columbia'' is now the official honors music for America's
vice presidents, the veep's version of ''Hail to the Chief.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Band, which prides itself as ''The President's Own,''
was organized in 1798 when Philadelphia was still the capital. It
moved to Washington when the capital did in the summer of 1800.
</P>
<P>
   The first Washington concert did not go unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   Anna Maria Thornton, wife of the Capitol's first architect,
wrote in her diary for Aug. 21, 1800, that the couple went to hear
the band ''playing at the tents which are fixed on the ground
intended for an University.'' That was Camp Hill, now headquarters
of the Navy's surgeon general.
</P>
<P>
   Workmen were scrambling that summer to ready the Capitol and the
White House in time for the arrival of Congress and President John
Adams in November. The place was little more than a messy
construction site.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Oliver Wolcott wrote of Washington at the
time:
</P>
<P>
   ''There are few houses in any one place, and most of them small,
miserable huts, which present an awful contrast to the public
buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   Brightening the scene, the Marine Band became known as ''The
President's Own'' probably because it was favored by President
Jefferson, who played the violin and harpsichord.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson took a lively interest in recruiting instrumentalists
for the band and extended his search to Italy. Sixteen Italian
musicians arrived in Washington in September 1805, only to learn
that a new commandant hadn't been told they were coming. Most
didn't stay long. But one, Venerando Pulizzi, later rejoined and
served as the band's director from 1818 to 1827.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the musicians have increased in number and
versatility, providing whatever music the White House needs: a jazz
combo, a harp soloist, rock, a German oompah-band, an opera singer,
a classical string quartet. One recent occasion featured a rap
performance, but not at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   During the Civil War, President Lincoln listened to concerts on
the South Lawn from a sofa in the White House Blue Room. Once he
ventured onto the portico and was spotted by the audience who
clamored for a speech. He turned back, saying he wished they would
let him sit quietly and enjoy the music.
</P>
<P>
   Poet Walt Whitman, for whom Lincoln was a hero, gave an
enthusiastic review to a Marine Band concert at the White House for
the Sunday Herald newspaper, reporting:
</P>
<P>
   ''The preponderance of ladies, most of them young, and in gay
attire, and all full of animation; the soft turf to walk upon; the
vista of trees, and the distant outlook; the circle of promenaders,
with the sparkling eyes that meet one everywhere; the strains of
Verdi, Meyerbeer or Strauss wafted to the ear.''
</P>
<P>
   President Theodore Roosevelt's daughter, Alice, was the first to
ask the band to play a jazz number and the tune she asked for,
Scott Joplin's ''Maple Leaf Rag,'' is still in the repertory.
</P>
<P>
   President Harding sometimes played his cornet at rehearsals.
</P>
<P>
   Then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton joined in on tenor sax at a
dinner for governors in 1991, the year before his election as
president.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Mining Complex Taken Over  </HEADLINE>
By ALISON MUTLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZVECAN, Yugoslavia (AP) -- In a pre-dawn raid Monday, NATO-led
peacekeepers moved to take control of a Serb-run mining complex
that U.N. officials said was polluting the air in the northern part
of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   British soldiers supporting the U.N. mission moved to within
yards of the complex before being stopped on a footbridge leading
into the facility. Negotiations were under way to take full control
of the lead smelter.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations said last week pollution from the plant was
raising lead levels to 200 times the accepted norms near Kosovska
Mitrovica, a city divided between predominantly Serb north and an
ethnic Albanian south.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. spokesman Michael Keats confirmed the operation was under
way.
</P>
<P>
   News of the lead levels sparked a rare moment of solidarity in
Kosovska Mitrovica, prompting Serb and ethnic Albanian leaders to
join U.N. personnel in publicly having their blood tested.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo Serb leader Oliver Ivanovic claimed the lead scare was a
ruse, however, to be used as an excuse for the United Nations to
take over the Zvecan plant.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovska Mitrovica has proved the most violence prone city in
Kosovo in the year since NATO-led peacekeepers took control of the
province following a 78-day air war that forced Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to pull his forces out.
</P>
<P>
   The city is one of the few in the province in which a
significant Serb population remains. Tens of thousands of Serbs
have fled attacks leveled in revenge for Milosevic's 18-month
crackdown on ethnic Albanians and a decade of repression.

<HEADLINE> Tammy Faye Plugs New Documentary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCK HILL, S.C. (AP) -- This documentary is a must-see, at least
in the eyes of Tammy Faye Bakker-Messner.
</P>
<P>
   The former wife of fallen televanglist Jim Bakker said the new
documentary, ''The Eyes of Tammy Faye,'' which shows the highs and
lows of her public life, treats her right.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very fair portrayal,'' she told Friday's edition of The
Herald of Rock Hill from her home in Matthews, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a little irreverent at times,'' but that's OK, she said.
''That's been my life. I've had black places and wonderful light
places.''
</P>
<P>
   The 79-minute film delves into the rise and fall of Tammy Faye
and Jim Bakker's Praise The Lord ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Of the good reviews she's hearing, Bakker-Messner said, ''I'm
the most shocked of anybody. I thought after 12 years, people would
be sick of this story.''

''And in the last decade, I've probably given as much money to
Democrats as Republicans.''

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Struggles With U.S. Dollars  </HEADLINE>
By CARLOS CISTERNAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- It was Manuel Jimenez's lucky day when a
confused passer-by handed the street beggar $5 worth of pennies,
dimes and quarters. A fistful of coins used to be worth 10 cents.
</P>
<P>
   But nearby shoppers here in Ecuador's capital were hardly
overjoyed trying to figure how much things cost amid the nation's
conversion to U.S. dollars from their local currency, the sucre.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the sucre being phased out, doing business has turned
into chaos,'' said Pedro Gutierrez, a merchant.
</P>
<P>
   Currency confusion, for better or worse, is spreading as the
impoverished nation nears the Sept. 13 target for completing the
controversial switch from the sucre to the greenback.
</P>
<P>
   Though recent opposition from Indians and labor groups is
fading, just figuring out the math of it -- $1 equals 25,000 sucres
-- is exasperating to many businesses and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   More than two-thirds of people here earn less than $30 a month,
making the dollar appear disproportionate to the meager means of
the average Ecuadorean -- and unwieldy for most small purchases. A
$20 bill currently fetches 500,000 sucres.
</P>
<P>
   President Gustavo Noboa hopes the changeover, which started in
March, will spur investment and bring down inflation topping 100
percent a year, the highest in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the move to the dollar will dampen inflation by
preventing Ecuador's government from printing more money to meet
its budgetary needs after years of deficit spending.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador's Central Bank president, Jose Ycaza, reported in early
August that 79 percent of sucre bills and 14 percent of national
coins had already been pulled from circulation.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of U.S. currency -- including the temporary
introduction of U.S.-minted coins -- has spawned a boom market for
cardboard conversion charts, sold by street vendors for 1,000
sucres, or 4 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Even with that tool as a crutch, figuring out a simple 70-cent
purchase has turned into a time-consuming mental workout for people
carrying both sucres and cents: two quarters, a dime, a 2,000-sucre
coin, and two pennies.
</P>
<P>
   Distinguishing the value of the strange foreign coins from
sucres has turned into a daily preoccupation. Ecuador's Central
Bank plans to soon replace the U.S. coins with its own change, to
be minted in similar denominations, sizes and colors to U.S.
pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters and half dollars.
</P>
<P>
   By phasing out its currency, Ecuador is joining Panama and nine
other countries in which the U.S. dollar is legal tender.
</P>
<P>
   Adopting U.S. currency comes after the near collapse of
Ecuador's corruption-ridden banking system that drove down the
value of the sucre on currency markets. Between January 1999 and
the beginning of this year, the sucre fell from 7,000 to the dollar
to nearly 30,000 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the dollar plan contend it will only benefit the
rich and worsen conditions for the poor by driving consumer prices
up to international levels. Ecuador is cutting subsidies, mostly in
fuels, to meet conditions of international lenders involved in the
changeover.
</P>
<P>
   Only two of every 10 Ecuadoreans have stable employment, and
higher fuel costs, it is feared, could lead to price increases
elsewhere in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   But many analysts say it is too soon to judge the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''To speak of failure is premature,'' said economist Francisco
Zalles. ''We have only gotten to a point where a portion of
monetary resources are in dollars. Starting Sept. 13, we'll be able
to talk about a dollar economy.''

<HEADLINE> Garth Brooks May Make Home Museum  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOODLETTSVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Garth Brooks is considering turning
his former Tennessee home into a museum, much like Elvis Presley's
Graceland in Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Rose Estate, in a north Nashville suburb, is valued at
more than $1.1 million. Brooks and his wife, Sandy, lived there for
about 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks wants to open the home to the public possibly by year's
end, although plans are still preliminary.
</P>
<P>
   If the project proceeds, Brooks will join Conway Twitty, Loretta
Lynn and Dolly Parton, who also have created tourist attractions
near their Tennessee homes to promote their country music careers.
</P>
<P>
   Some neighbors are leery of Brooks' plans. ''We value our quiet
and privacy on this dead-end street,'' said Jae Park, who lives
three doors away.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks bought the home and 20 acres in 1991 for $435,000. The
next year he made $400,000 in improvements, including indoor courts
for racquetball and basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks' attorney Robert Langford said he will unveil plans to
neighbors at a private meeting Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Science Center To Open in Oakland  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW FORDAHL
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Mildred Ivory watches in amazement as the
Milky Way spills across a black sky sprinkled with streaking
meteors, fuzzy comets, brilliant planets and thousands of twinkling
stars.
</P>
<P>
   The 11-year-old Oakland girl has never seen anything like it
from home, where the night is overwhelmed by city lights. But she
didn't have to trek into the country for the view, just across town
to the new Chabot Space and Science Center planetarium.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't have a telescope,'' she said after a brief preview
show. ''I want one.''
</P>
<P>
   Her reaction was heartening to organizers of the $76 million
center, an 86,000-square-foot shrine to the stars that replaces a
smaller complex built in 1915. It will open Saturday after a decade
of planning by the city, school district and other groups.
</P>
<P>
   The center includes a planetarium that accurately projects stars
onto a 70-foot dome and giant telescopes to see the real thing.
Interactive exhibits focus on space and exploration. Wide-format
science films are shown on another big dome, nearly filling it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We live science every day. We just don't know it,'' said Jose
Olivarez, Chabot's director of astronomy. ''This is a way to
connect us to our scientific world through the stars, which every
human being has an interest in.''
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by redwoods and pines covering 13 acres in the
Oakland Hills, the new center is intended to spark the curiosity of
children who visit and reinforce what they learn through online
programs and lesson plans.
</P>
<P>
   The center ''is really like none other in the country,'' said
Derrick Pitts, director of the Fels Planetarium in Philadelphia.
''Everything in that entire complex is focused on astronomy
education.''
</P>
<P>
   Up to 250,000 visitors are expected annually, including 50,000
schoolchildren. Besides the exhibits, planetarium and observatory,
visitors can participate in science labs and mock space shuttle
missions. Teachers will be offered for extra science training.
</P>
<P>
   ''The truth of the matter is that an awful lot of our kids have
never been up in the parks,'' said Oakland City Councilman Dick
Spees. ''They've never seen the night sky from a meadow.''
</P>
<P>
   Plagued for years by high crime, crumbling schools and rampant
poverty, Oakland seems an unlikely location for a science center
that rivals those in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and its more
glamorous neighbor across the bay, San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   But Oakland had a will -- specifically, the will of 19th-century
water engineer Anthony Chabot, who endowed a downtown observatory
for the city schools on the condition that views be provided to the
public for free.
</P>
<P>
   The original Oakland observatory moved in 1915 to a Victorian
building on a low ridge near Mills College. A small planetarium
funded by the Rotary Club was added in the 1960s to spice up field
trips for school groups.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, schoolchildren were barred from the observatory because
of a combination of its age and proximity to an earthquake fault
line. Light pollution from East Bay sprawl also made viewing
difficult at best.
</P>
<P>
   The telescopes, which many consider to be some of the finest in
the world available for public viewing, needed a new home. But the
school district and the city were having trouble funding even basic
services.
</P>
<P>
   ''The city owned the land. The schools owned the buildings. And
everybody was arguing what do you do with it,'' Spees said. ''That
is where it all began.''
</P>
<P>
   Spees helped create an agency in 1989 that included the school
system, the city and the park district.
</P>
<P>
   The new agency received funding from corporations, foundations
as well as the state and federal governments. Partnerships were
formed with universities, national labs and the Smithsonian
Institution. The East Bay Astronomical Society volunteered to
refurbish the aging telescopes.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than constructing buildings and then figuring out how to
fill them, planners of the facility spent years developing a
program before designing any buildings, said Mike Reynolds,
Chabot's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a very different kind of process,'' he said. ''A lot of
facilities build the buildings and then ask, 'What do we do with
this thing once it's built?'''
</P>
<P>
   From curvaceous architecture inspired by celestial orbits and
spheres to the sculptures and paintings on the walls, visitors are
reminded of the center's focus on astronomy and space's connection
to the arts and humanities.
</P>
<P>
   ''The beauty of astronomy is that it not only feeds wonderfully
into the other sciences but also into art and music,'' Reynolds
said. ''The beauty of the universe is artistic, whether it is
something that is painted or something you hear.''

<HEADLINE> Dallas Searches For Superintendent  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN PARROTT
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- If finding a long-term superintendent were a test,
Dallas school trustees would have earned an F.
</P>
<P>
   After firing Bill Rojas last month, they've launched their third
search in four years for a leader who can manage the 10th largest
school district in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   It's a process all too familiar to an urban district that has
gained a national reputation for instability. And it has many
wondering if the district's poor track record will repel the most
qualified candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Rojas, a brash-talking New York native who had been
superintendent in San Francisco, sparred with the school board for
most of his 11-month tenure.
</P>
<P>
   He was fired 7-1 by trustees who invoked a ''good rapport''
clause in his contract. ''He was lacking in some diplomacy,'' said
trustee Jose Plata. ''You can't be a South Bronx, New York, guy in
Dallas all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Rojas was hired last August to replace Yvonne Gonzalez, who was
sentenced to federal prison for embezzling $16,000 in district
funds to buy personal furniture.
</P>
<P>
   When trustees hired Rojas -- a surprise candidate -- they lauded
his experience working with minority students in San Francisco.
Trustees agreed to pay him a base salary of $260,000, the highest
in the nation at the time.
</P>
<P>
   But even a hefty salary may not be enough to lure top applicants
to replace Rojas, said Fred Bateman, executive director of the
Urban Superintendents Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dallas is sort of red-flagged in everybody's eyes as one of
those unstable places,'' he said. ''People say to themselves, 'Why
should I -- even for that amount of money -- throw myself into the
fiery furnace?'''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas is not the only school district with a revolving door.
Since May 1999, 14 of the nation's 25 largest school districts have
replaced their superintendents or began searching for a new leader.
In at least eight of those cases, the deposed superintendents had
difficulty getting along with school board members or other elected
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Bateman noted that superintendents of urban districts stay put
an average of 2.3 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a harder job these days,'' he said. ''You must be as much
a politician as an educator and a manager. It's kind of a
superhuman kind of person.''
</P>
<P>
   While trustees cited Rojas' poor communication and abrasive
style in firing him, he called his termination ''vindictive
behavior by a group of micromanagers.''
</P>
<P>
   Rojas, who had offered his resignation before he was fired July
5, has appealed the school board's decision to pay him $90,000 in
severance, instead of buying out his contract for $520,000. The
school district last week sued Rojas, arguing that he is not
entitled to any additional pay.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas must next hire someone who can work harmoniously with the
board and public, said Houston school board trustee Donald McAdams,
author of the book, ''Fighting to Save Our Urban Schools And
Winning: Lessons from Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   A search committee of three trustees and four community and
business leaders is compiling a ''short list'' of five candidates
for the full school board to consider later this month. The group
will consider non-educators as well as professionals in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are committed to coming up with a new, absolutely
bulletproof superintendent,'' said Ken Zornes, a trustee who is
leading the search committee.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas Mayor Ron Kirk, whose two daughters attend public
schools, said it will take more than a new superintendent to
stabilize the district. He has called for the resignation of the
board of trustees, who he said have failed to lead the district.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no confidence that the people who picked the last three
superintendents will be successful,'' Kirk said. ''The definition
of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again but
expecting to get different results.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas residents attending a recent public forum told the search
committee they want a proven leader who embraces the community and
its 163,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know as well as I know, with all the changes at the top,
that we've had too many superintendents in too short a time,'' said
businessman Terry Kelley.

<HEADLINE> Alberto weakening; new weather system forms in Gulf  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) - Hurricane Alberto, once a strong Category 3 storm,
has gradually lost strength as it moves over cooler waters in the
north Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a tropical depression in the western Gulf of Mexico
could become a tropical storm as early as Monday, forecasters said.
</P>
<P>
   At 11 p.m. Sunday EDT, Alberto's maximum sustained winds were 80
mph, down from 115 mph the day before. Additional weakening was
forecast over the next three days.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto was located about 810 miles west of the Azores Islands,
west of Portugal. Alberto was moving at about 16 mph Sunday and
forecasters predicted the storm would gradually continue on this
course for the next 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ''We expect Alberto to continue moving east-northeast and then
it's expected to slow down,'' said James Franklin, a hurricane
specialist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The tropical depression in the Gulf was stationary at 11 p.m.
EDT. The storm's poorly-defined center was located about 340 miles
southeast of Brownsville, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   With winds near 35 mph, the depression was expected to begin
moving northwest toward land, forecasters said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could be a tropical storm by during the day on Monday,''
said hurricane forecaster Stacy Stewart. ''The center's broad and
disorganized, it will have to pull together a little bit before the
system can get going.''
</P>
<P>
   Tropical depressions become tropical storms once they reach 40
mph. Tropical storms become hurricanes once their top sustained
winds reach 74 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart said the depression could reach hurricane intensity as
early as Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Residents along the lower Texas coast and in northeastern
Mexico should monitor the progress of this depression,'' Stewart
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''From Corpus Christi to Tampico, they need to stay aware of
this system,'' Stewart said. ''They need to keep advised on this
system and if they don't have their hurricane-ready emergency kits
together, they need to start doing that now. Don't wait until
watches and warnings are put up on Monday.''

<HEADLINE> Lieberman To Attend Producer's Party  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN SOLOMON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- On his first evening at the
Democratic convention, vice presidential hopeful Joseph Lieberman
will hobnob at a Hollywood producer's home with executives whose
companies paid $5,000 to $25,000 for the honor.
</P>
<P>
   The host, producer David Salzman, hails from an industry that
Lieberman has criticized for fomenting violence and sex, and
produced a daytime talk show the Connecticut senator once
criticized.
</P>
<P>
   The companies that helped underwrite the reception include
Microsoft Corp., the software giant that is battling the Clinton
administration over antitrust violations, and Koch Industries, the
oil pipeline under investigation by the Clinton Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   The sponsor is the New Democrat Network, a political action
committee that Lieberman helped found in 1996 to advance the ideas
of centrist, pro-business Democrats like himself.
</P>
<P>
   The PAC has collected tens of thousands of dollars in donations
from oil, tobacco and drug companies criticized by his new running
mate, Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   What message does it send?
</P>
<P>
   ''These are some real mixed messages we're getting,'' lamented
Larry Makinson, head of the Center for Responsive Politics that
studies campaign financing.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of the groups Gore has been attacking, he seems to be
taking money from, and the ones Gore is popular with, like
Hollywood, Lieberman is attacking,'' Makinson said. ''They've got
both their money bases covered.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon Rosenberg, president of the New Democrat Network, said the
event Tuesday night was planned for months, long before Lieberman
was named Gore's running mate, to give pro-business Democrats a
chance to mingle with corporate supporters.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore picked Lieberman as running mate, the event was
changed to a tribute to the Connecticut senator.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was always coming and now this is going to turn into a
celebration of our founder. People really like Joe and are
passionate about him as a leader of the new Democratic movement,''
Rosenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The dinner was one of four events for companies or individuals
who donated $10,000 or $25,000 to help underwrite the PAC's
activities at the Democratic convention. The executives also have
access to a luxury skybox in the convention hall.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Microsoft and Koch, contributors also included America
Online, AT&AMP;T Wireless, Lucent Technologies and Citigroup.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg said about half the 200 executives invited to
Tuesday's reception have never donated to NDN. They'll get the
chance to mingle with the likes of Lieberman, Sens. Bob Graham of
Florida and John Breaux and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Reps.
Cal Dooley, D-Calif., Adam Smith, D-Wash., and Jim Moran, D-Va.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an opportunity to reach out to some of the people
we've gotten to know in L.A., get them some exposure to the NDN and
new Democrats. We hope some of them will become supporters,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, the reception was moved from a restaurant to
Salzman's home in Beverly Hills. ''We thought it would be a better
place to have a party,'' Rosenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Salzman is a prominent Democratic supporter and well-known
Hollywood figure whose works range from Oscar awards shows and the
1993 Clinton inauguration to TV shows like ''Dallas,'' ''Full
House,'' ''Mad TV'' and ''Fresh Prince of Bel Air.''
</P>
<P>
   He's also listed as executive producer of the Jenny Jones talk
show that one of his companies produced -- one of those singled out
for criticism by Lieberman. Salzman's home phone number is unlisted
and he could not be reached for comment Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg said he doesn't think the event at Salzman's home
sends a double message.
</P>
<P>
   ''Senator Lieberman has been concerned about some of the
messages sent by the entertainment industry. But that industry also
produces plenty of great stuff too,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In talk show appearances Sunday, Lieberman said he would use the
convention to renew his call for less violence and sex in public
entertainment. ''I will, and I think that's exactly the message
that the vice president has,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I find that the average family feels as if it's in a
competition with a lot of the stuff ... coming out of the
entertainment industry. And government has to be on the side of
standing with those people to help them, because they feel helpless
against the big entertainment industry,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   NDN touts itself as a ''political venture capital fund'' which
endorses and contributes to pro-business Democrats who want to
''lead the U.S. and the world into the 21st century and the
Internet Age.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal Election Commission records show it has given more than
$200,000 to support pro-business candidates this election cycle. It
has raised more than $400,000 in donations in 2000 alone.
</P>
<P>
   Among the donors who have given money to the group: oil giants
Texaco, Koch and Occidental, pharmaceutical companies Merck,
Pfizer, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Glaxo Wellcome, and tobacco
company Brown and Williamson.

<HEADLINE> Leaders Debate Colombia Aid  </HEADLINE>
By WILL WEISSERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARTAGENA, Colombia (AP) -- Government soldiers trained and
equipped by Green Berets scour the jungles for the enemy. It's an
image that recalls the early days of the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   But with the arrival of elite U.S. troops on an anti-drug
training mission, Colombian leaders and Clinton administration
officials are vowing that this South American nation will not
become another Vietnam for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not offering to engage U.S. troops. It's not on the
table. It's simply not going to happen,'' said Barry McCaffrey,
President Clinton's point man in the war on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey, a Vietnam veteran and retired four-star general,
spoke Thursday about implementing Washington's $1.3 billion aid
package for the anti-drug fight.
</P>
<P>
   Under the initiative, U.S. Special Forces soldiers are training
Colombian army anti-narcotics troops. With U.S.-supplied weapons
and helicopters, the Colombians are to seize drug crops from
leftist guerrillas and other armed groups and allow their
subsequent eradication by crop-dusters.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 American servicemen, including members of the Army and
the Air Force, have begun training Colombian troops, the Pentagon
said.
</P>
<P>
   No more than 500 American soldiers and 300 contract employees
can be in Colombia at one time, and they are barred from going into
combat. Colombian officials say such restrictions ensure the United
States isn't wading into this Andean nation's 36-year-civil war,
which pits the Colombian state against at least 20,000 rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ''The American support is very regimented,'' said Gen. Fernando
Tapias, head of Colombia's armed forces. ''Men from the United
States are not waiting in every corner of Colombia -- they'll be
where we need them for anti-narcotics training.''
</P>
<P>
   President Andres Pastrana said it will be Colombian troops who
go into the danger zone.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. troops ''are here only to help in specific ways,'' Pastrana
said in an interview while watching military maneuvers at a
sweltering army base near Bogota. ''The United States does not face
the concerns here the way that we do.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Washington's assistance program begins, questions are
being raised about what separates anti-narcotics efforts and
anti-insurgency missions.
</P>
<P>
   Already, U.S.-donated combat helicopters have been diverted from
anti-drug missions to rescue Colombian policemen under attack by
rebels, and critics see many other quandaries developing.
</P>
<P>
   ''The (Clinton) administration has sworn up and down it knows
what it's doing and where to draw the line on this issue, but as we
get into this fight, the U.S. is going to realize that there is no
line,'' said Adam Isacson, an analyst at the Center for
International Policy in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey insists the U.S. role will remain as clearly
delineated as the drug-producing plantations in Colombia's
Amazonian jungles and Andean highlands.
</P>
<P>
   When soldiers look down from the helicopters at the
''checkerboards'' of drug crops, ''it's obvious where the problem
is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups say Washington is tightening links with a
military that has committed human rights abuses -- and that has ties
to right-wing paramilitary groups which make money from drugs and
also have death squads in many areas.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey denied there is any ''overt linkage between the state
and paramilitary groups'' and said he has witnessed a ''watershed
change'' in the way Colombia's military operates.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Colombian police and armed forces have changed their
training systems. They are now committed to the general notion of
human rights. They are transparent to the news media,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Given the stakes, Washington must help Colombia, McCaffrey
insists.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does Colombia produce the vast majority of cocaine
consumed around the world, but its drug gangs are shipping an
increasing share of heroin. Drug-related violence and corruption
are a threat to one of Latin America's oldest democracies.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot let this crucial country implode under the weight of
drugs and violence,'' McCaffrey said.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Fights Intolerant Image  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Reform Party presidential contender
Pat Buchanan sought a more tolerant image Sunday in his effort to
strengthen his long-shot White House bid against both legal and
political challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want anyone who hates anyone. We don't want any
bigots, we don't want anyone who hates Jewish folks,'' Buchanan
said Sunday on NBC's ''Meet the Press.'' ''No haters need apply.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference later, Buchanan complimented Joseph
Lieberman, the Connecticut senator and Orthodox Jew selected as
running mate by Democrat Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan recounted the criticism Gore has received for his
fund-raising activities in 1996, and he said, ''I think Joe
Lieberman has his work cut out for him if he's going to be the
conscience of this ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's opponents, who say John Hagelin is the real Reform
Party nominee and should receive $12.5 million in federal funds,
say Buchanan's comments of tolerance are a political makeover that
can't mask the fact that some white supremacist groups support him.
</P>
<P>
   ''He won't denounce their support,'' said Donna Donovan, press
secretary for the Hagelin faction and a founder of the Reform Party
established by Ross Perot.
</P>
<P>
   Late Saturday in a speech claiming the disputed presidential
nomination, Buchanan reached out directly to Perot's supporters by
suggesting that he and the Texas billionaire ''do battle together''
on the same side.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no response from Perot, who skipped the
tumultuous convention and has offered no endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   The party he founded eight years ago limped out of this seaside
town Sunday, two sides heading in opposite legal and ideological
directions.
</P>
<P>
   Perot's supporters, offended by Buchanan's style and his
outspokenness on social issues, have filed two complaints with the
Federal Election Commission contending he fraudulently claimed the
party's presidential nomination and seeking to prevent him from
receiving the federal money.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan predicted they could only delay his receipt of the
money by a few weeks and said he would continue no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we can rent ourselves a bus to go around this country, I
can use the free media,'' Buchanan said on C-SPAN. ''We can have a
fighting chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Goldman, Hagelin's faction's attorney, said that if the
FEC rules in Buchanan's favor, he will seek a court injunction to
freeze the money and file a lawsuit in the U.S. Court of Appeals in
Washington. That action could come within two weeks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, state chapters in Texas and perhaps elsewhere are
expected to take their own legal action to fight Buchanan
nomination, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Buchanan's camp says it is confident that any judge will
rule in his favor in part because evidence exists that major
players in the party leadership have stayed on his side. They
include Chairman Gerry Moan, who controls the party finances and
Treasurer Tom McLaughlin, as well as Perot's 1996 running mate Pat
Choate.
</P>
<P>
   Bay Buchanan, the candidate's sister and campaign manager, said
she expects to receive the money within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But she also predicted raising $1 million to $2 million in
contributions between Labor Day and Election Day, enough to keep
the campaign operating and her brother on the road five days a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said Hagelin's naming of a millionaire running mate,
Nat Goldhaber, would not change the dynamic of the race.
</P>
<P>
   ''John Hagelin can spend the wealth of an empire and he's not
going to get anywhere,'' Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign also faces a political fight that has Buchanan
battling a longtime image of intolerance propelled by some of his
writings and statements. For example, in his book, ''A Republic,
Not an Empire,'' Buchanan argued that the United States faced no
threat from Nazi Germany after 1940.
</P>
<P>
   And last week, he released a ''Statement of Personal Belief''
that said ''rampant homosexuality'' had led to the downfall of
great empires and similarly threatens the United States. He also
compared doctors who perform late-term abortions to Nazi doctors
who practiced euthanasia.
</P>
<P>
   But Buchanan also named a black woman, former Los Angeles
teacher Ezola Foster, to be his running mate. And several times he
has condemned hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Foster is a former member of the right-wing John Birch Society,
but Buchanan said he was ''not bothered by it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''My choice is as good a thing as I have done politically in my
lifetime,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was a member. She is not now,'' said Buchanan spokesman
Brian Doherty. He said she resigned because ''she thought it would
become an issue in the campaign, and she wanted to keep focus on
the issue of the Buchanan campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Doherty said he did not know when Foster resigned, but said it
was recently. A campaign source said she toured with the society in
1995 and joined shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   The society's Web site, www.jbs.org, lists her as a speaker for
its fall tour.
</P>
<P>
   A man who answered the telephone at Foster's Los Angeles home
Sunday night refused to allow her to speak with a reporter.

<HEADLINE> Few Changes in Demilitarized Zone  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANMUNJOM, South Korea (AP) -- A glossy book in a gift shop at a
U.S. military base just south of the Demilitarized Zone that
separates North and South Korea carries a chapter title: ''A New
Era of Reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's no mention of an inter-Korean summit in June, the
reopening of border liaison offices on Monday, plans for temporary
reunions of separated families Tuesday and other recent gestures of
friendship between once-bitter enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the chapter dwells on a round of family reunions in
1985, meetings of the prime ministers of both Koreas in 1992 and
other events a decade ago that were soon eclipsed by antagonism.
</P>
<P>
   The outdated book for tourists bused in from Seoul captures the
museum-like aura of the truce village of Panmunjom on the heavily
fortified border, which seems out of tune with the swift changes
afoot on the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides remain wary of one another, but ties between the
democratic South and communist North have warmed more in the last
two months than in the half-century since they went to war.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators from Seoul will head to Pyongyang at the end of the
month to discuss peacemaking measures. There are plans to reconnect
a railroad that cuts across the Demilitarized Zone, or DMZ.
</P>
<P>
   And the two sides held a ceremony Monday to reopen liaison
offices closed four years ago in Panmunjom, 35 miles north of
Seoul. ''This shows that the will of South and North Korea to
faithfully implement their summit agreement is firm,'' said South
Korean Unification Minister Park Jae-kyu.
</P>
<P>
   But little has changed along the buffer zone, a reminder of the
hostility that has long infused the relationship between the Koreas
since they were divided at the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Heavily armed South Korean soldiers, backed by U.S. troops, man
guardposts every 100 or 200 yards along fences topped with coils of
barbed wire.
</P>
<P>
   Triangular red signs warn of minefields, which sometimes have to
be resown when rains wash away the explosives during the monsoon
season in July and August.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-tank barriers squat alongside roads, a defensive measure in
the event of a North Korean attack. Stilts prop up the barriers
over or beside roads, and can be detonated so that the huge slabs
of concrete collapse and block the paths.
</P>
<P>
   All this is visible to tourists who pay $48 to tour Panmunjom,
where border talks are sometimes held, and get a taste of one of
the last vestiges of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   It's an easy sell: many tourists get a faint thrill from
watching North Korean guards on the other side of the Military
Demarcation Line scrutinize them with binoculars. For most, it's
the closest they'll get to one of the most mysterious countries in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean guards wearing sunglasses stand like statues, sweat
dripping off their clenched fists, in an aggressive pose inspired
by the Korean martial art, tae kwon do.
</P>
<P>
   Panmunjom is a history lesson in the brutality and animosity
that have shaped inter-Korean ties. In August 1976, North Korean
soldiers beat to death two U.S. Army officers trimming a tree in
the DMZ. In 1984, a Russian defector sprinted across the border,
prompting a shootout that left one South Korean and three North
Korean guards dead.
</P>
<P>
   Matching the spirit of rapprochement, North Korea has stopped
broadcasting anti-South propaganda along the border, although
patriotic music still wafts across on the wind.
</P>
<P>
   But old propaganda signs that seem less relevant than ever are
still visible on the hills. ''Self-reliance is our way of life,''
reads one, an irony considering that Pyongyang is dependent for
survival on outside food aid.
</P>
<P>
   ''It kind of looks like the Hollywood sign in California,'' Spc.
Julio Fortis of Puerto Rico said while guiding a group of visitors
around Panmunjom this week.
</P>
<P>
   Another tourist-pleaser is the 600-pound North Korean flag that
flies from a 528-foot pole in the North's virtually uninhabited
village of Kijong-dong, which is visible across the border.
</P>
<P>
   The giant flag is so heavy that it often lies limp at its mast,
waiting for a wind strong enough to carry it.
</P>
<P>
   While the tourist tours follow the same format they always have,
comments on the trip in the guest book at the gift shop vary
wildly.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ironical Tragedy Situation,'' wrote a concerned Japanese
visitor. ''Freakin' weather,'' complained a New Zealander. ''Mas
cerveza'' (more beer), scrawled a thirsty Venezuelan. ''Shoot 'em
in the face,'' said an Orlando, Fla. native.
</P>
<P>
   A British embassy worker from Seoul thought the tour had a lot
to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cute guys in uniform,'' she wrote, ''what more could a girl
ask for?''

minister, Ji Peiding, and a crowd of Arab ambassadors greeted Arafat on his
arrival early Monday at Beijing's airport. During his one-day visit, Arafat was
to meet President Jiang Zemin to convey his impression of last month's summit
and to discuss a possible unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state next

Koreas Reopen Border Liaisons
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PANMUNJOM, South Korea (AP) -- North and South Korea reopened border liaison
offices Monday, four years after they were closed because of political tensions.
Relations between the two Koreas have warmed significantly since their leaders
held a historic summit in Pyongyang, the North's capital, in June. In follow-up
talks by their deputies in Seoul two weeks ago, the Koreas agreed to reopen the
border liaison offices. The liaison offices first opened in 1992 to work as
government channels of dialogue. They closed four years later after a dispute
over a North Korean submarine that washed ashore in South Korea.

Buchanan Fights Intolerant Image

   LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Reform Party presidential contender Pat Buchanan
sought a more tolerant image Sunday in his effort to strengthen his long-shot
White House bid against both legal and political challenges. At a news
conference later, Buchanan complimented Joseph Lieberman, the Connecticut
senator and Orthodox Jew selected as running mate by Democrat Al Gore.
Buchanan's opponents, who say John Hagelin is the real Reform Party nominee and
should receive $12.5 million in federal funds, say Buchanan's comments of
tolerance are a political makeover that can't mask the fact that some white
supremacist groups support him.

Verizon Strike Enters Second Week

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Verizon Communications and its unions remain at odds over
a new contract proposal on the table, dashing hopes that thousands of telephone
technicians and operators would soon leave the picket lines and return to work.
The company, seeking to resolve a strike that has dragged on since Aug. 6,
offered the unions what it called a ''revised comprehensive offer'' early
Sunday. But union negotiators quickly denounced the offer, saying it failed to
address such key issues as mandatory overtime and the shifting of workloads to
areas of cheaper labor. On some points, the proposal represents a step backward,
union officials said.

<HEADLINE> 3,500 Support Abu-Jamal in L.A.  </HEADLINE>
By ANTHONY BREZNICAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- More than 3,500 protesters marching in
support of a death row inmate jammed downtown streets Sunday,
putting police on edge with deafening screams and sending shoppers
and business owners fleeing for cover.
</P>
<P>
   There were no confrontations during the march, but one
black-garbed man was arrested while allegedly damaging the security
fence around the official demonstration area.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators walked shoulder-to-shoulder, jumping up and down
as they made their way to the Staples Center, with officers in riot
gear blocking off streets outside of the approved parade route.
Protesters occasionally broke apart from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Families pushing babies in strollers fled drugstores and
souvenir shops as they saw the crowd approach. Store owners rolled
down steel doors over their storefronts and ran inside as marchers
got close.
</P>
<P>
   The protest in support of Mumia Abu-Jamal, on death row for
killing a Philadelphia police officer in 1981, was the first major
gathering of demonstrators massing in Los Angeles for the
Democratic National Convention, which starts Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, a march by area religious leaders in support of
abortion rights turned into a confrontation with abortion opponents
when about 40 members of Operation Rescue shadowed the event.
</P>
<P>
   ''Take the Bible Challenge,'' the Operation Rescue members
shouted through a bullhorn at people arriving for a pre-march
service at St. John's Episcopal Church. ''Come tell us in God's
words why it's OK to kill babies.''
</P>
<P>
   They also waved large photos of aborted fetuses.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 pro-choice demonstrators organized by the Religious
Coalition for Reproductive Choice and local religious leaders
walked just under 2 miles to the convention site. They chanted
slogans, surrounded by Operation Rescue members trying to shout
them down.
</P>
<P>
   Private security guards hired by the demonstration organizers
accompanied the marchers, and police paced the procession in squad
cars.
</P>
<P>
   In the Abu-Jamal protest, activists gathered at Pershing Square
and rallied for more than two hours before their 12-block march.
</P>
<P>
   When the group reached the fenced-in protest area outside the
convention site, a Latino band took the stage, protesters chanted
''Free Mumia'' and other slogans, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson passed
buckets through the crowd seeking donations for Abu-Jamal's
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Police said 10 to 15 people, most wearing black clothes with
black bandanas over their faces, were spotted climbing the chain
link security fence.
</P>
<P>
   Officers arrested one of them, Daniel Katz Woutat, 18, of Long
Beach and booked him for felony vandalism for allegedly making
holes in the fence, according to a department news release. An
officer at the scene said he was using a stick to untwist the
fence.
</P>
<P>
   A gas mask was found in his black backpack, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the protest, the Fire Department tied a hose
to a fence, creating a makeshift fountain for sun-beaten
demonstrators. Protesters ran with arms outstretched to dance in
the artificial rain, shouting ''Thank you! Thank you!''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Mackler, Abu-Jamal's defense coordinator, read a statement
from the prisoner opposing both major political parties.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you vote for one of the two hated dogs of American
politics, you are voting for your own oppression,'' the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some distributed leaflets for protests scheduled later in the
week while others waved picket signs opposing the death penalty.
One sign read, ''Not one more lynching'' and was emblazoned with a
picture of Abu-Jamal, convicted of killing an officer in 1981.
Supporters contend Abu-Jamal, who is black, was framed by racist
police.
</P>
<P>
   A wooden wall etched with thousands of names of alleged victims
of police brutality was set up along one edge of the square.
</P>
<P>
   By supporting the death penalty, Al Gore and George W. Bush have
continued to ''march the retarded, the young and quite possibly the
innocent to their deaths,'' actor and activist Ed Asner told the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ''This fight is for our very souls,'' he said. ''Mumia must not
die!''
</P>
<P>
   Police began working 12-hour shifts, sending out hundreds of
additional officers to gird for a week of demonstrations.
Environmentalists and striking workers at a Santa Monica hotel also
held rallies Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   At the protesters' headquarters near MacArthur Park, nicknamed
the Convergence Center, demonstrators were taught Sunday how to
cope with tear gas and pepper spray and how to behave when
confronted by police.
</P>
<P>
   Others made banners, picket signs and large, satiric puppets for
demonstrations outside the Staples Center this week.

<HEADLINE> Cos. Prepare For Democrat Takeover  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Oil, gas and mining interests are throwing a
blues bash for Rep. John Dingell. Heavy-hitters Texaco and
Bristol-Myers Squibb are among 24 companies picking up the tab for
an extravagant Mardi Gras-like celebration for Louisiana Sen. John
Breaux. Insurance giant Transamerica is opening its corporate suite
for Rep. Charles Rangel.
</P>
<P>
   While Democrats will be partying all across Tinseltown next
week, these events go far beyond typical convention-week soirees.
Each is aimed at the Democrat who would take over a key committee
if the party managed to regain control of Congress in the November
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Each is underwritten by special interests whose business is
affected by those committees.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am certain that was a factor,'' said Daphne Magnuson, a
spokeswoman for the American Gas Association, which is
co-sponsoring the reception for Dingell, the senior Democrat on the
House Commerce Committee, whose oversight includes the energy,
health and telecommunications industries.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the gas group in sponsoring the event at the House of
Blues is the Edison Electric Institute, National Mining Association
and Nuclear Energy Institute.
</P>
<P>
   In the game of goodwill sowing, the Democratic convention
provides corporate America an unparalleled chance to hedge its bets
-- just in case Democrats gain six seats in the House or five seats
in the Senate and take over Capitol Hill again.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the Democrats retake control of Congress, then everyone
will be their friend,'' said Larry Makinson, executive director of
the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that tracks
campaign finance. ''But being their friend before they take control
probably wins you a special place in their heart.''
</P>
<P>
   A leading Senate advocate of changing campaign finance laws,
Democrat Russell Feingold of Wisconsin, criticized the
special-interest bashes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Democratic Party is supposed to be the party of Jefferson,
the party of Jackson, not the party of the big monied interests,''
Feingold told hundreds of activists gathered just a few blocks away
from the Democratic convention site for the alternative Shadow
Convention. ''The real story at the Democratic convention is
legalized bribery and influence peddling.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, many of Feingold's Democratic colleagues are
basking in the attention.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., the top Democrat on the Senate
Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, is to be feted
Wednesday at a breakfast co-sponsored by the 2.5 million-member
National Education Association, the nation's largest teachers'
union.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has been a long-time supporter of public education,'' NEA
spokeswoman Becky Fleischauer said of Kennedy, winner of the
union's Friend of Education award this year.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Enron, an energy and communications company, has taken
over a room in a Santa Monica hotel Tuesday to honor Sen. Jeff
Bingaman of New Mexico, top Democrat on the Senate Energy and
Natural Resources Committee. Bingaman would ascend to the
chairmanship if his party recaptures the majority. He backs Enron's
efforts to deregulate the electric industry.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to make sure Mr. Bingaman knows what our position is,
and I think he supports that position too,'' Enron spokesman Mark
Palmer said. ''We want people to know what we stand for.''
</P>
<P>
   Two-dozen corporations have signed on to co-sponsor a salute to
Breaux, in line to chair a subcommittee of the Senate Finance
Committee, which has jurisdiction over health, trade and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Helping to sponsor ''Mardi Gras Goes Hollywood,'' scheduled for
Tuesday night on the same Paramount Studios lot where the TV series
''NYPD Blue'' and ''Ally McBeal'' are filmed, are the tobacco
company Brown &AMP; Williamson, drug maker Bristol-Myers Squibb and oil
company Texaco.
</P>
<P>
   Jambalaya and gumbo will be on the menu, a procession of Mardi
Gras floats will parade through the streets, and a zydeco band will
supply the musical accompaniment.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more active lawmakers will be Rangel, D-N.Y., who
would take control of the House Ways and Means Committee if
Democrats recapture the House.
</P>
<P>
   Transamerica is the sole sponsor of a Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee celebration in Rangel's honor. The insurance
company will host the late-afternoon gathering Wednesday at its Los
Angeles offices. Rangel also was feted at a separate reception
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, former U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor
plans to host a fund-raiser for Rangel this week. Kantor now works
for the lawyer-lobbying firm of Mayer, Brown &AMP; Platt, whose clients
include Aetna, America Online and General Electric.
</P>
<P>
   Rangel's chief of staff, Jim Capel, said the lawmaker is being
honored ''because of his effectiveness as a legislator and the
leadership he provides in the Congress,'' not because he is in line
to take over a top committee.

<HEADLINE> Firefighters Take On Wildfires  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON DININNY
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMILTON, Mont. (AP) -- As a three-mile-long wall of flames
roared across a ridge overlooking a small town north of here, the
St. Joe Hotshots were furiously digging trenches to halt the fire's
spread.
</P>
<P>
   The ensuing lull as the fire retreated over the next few days
was a welcome respite for a weary crew that's been battling blazes
since May 12.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, the St. Joe Hotshots received
their first call that day to report to a fire in the Grand Canyon.
Since then, they've fought another 16 fires across the West.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most savage is in Bitterroot Valley, where one
cluster of fires south of Hamilton had burned 112,000 acres and
another north of Hamilton had charred 8,700 acres by Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would consider this the most extreme fire behavior we've
seen so far this season,'' said crew leader Rory Laws. ''We've been
a day late and a dollar short on this fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Due to the high number of fires across the country and a lack of
firefighting resources, all 65 U.S. hotshot teams are currently
battling blazes. They work 14 days on, two days off, and then
immediately report to a new location.
</P>
<P>
   This summer has provided a stiff test of the St. Joe crew's love
of their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''My wife used to be a firefighter, so she knows what the job
entails,'' said squad leader Shawn Pearson of Coeur d'Alene. ''But
I can really only pick about five or six days since May that I've
spent at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Crew member Glenn Tingley, also from Coeur d'Alene, said he
accepts that he'll rarely see his wife and two children during the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''My daughter just turned 9,'' he said. ''I've been to one
birthday of hers because it falls in the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   The 20-person crew, 17 men and three women, ranges in age from
21 to 45. They eat, sleep and work together for five months of
every year -- and understand that as much as they love their jobs,
family and friends are eagerly awaiting their return.
</P>
<P>
   The memories of close calls are always with them.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hanford,'' said Harmony Hammons, 21, when asked to name a
crisis the crew confronted this season.
</P>
<P>
   Tears welled in her eyes, and her crewmates nodded in agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was chaos,'' Hammons said. ''I've been fighting fires for
three years, but this is my first year on a hotshot crew, and it
was definitely more than I'd seen before.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had to run a couple of times. It really makes you think
about things.''
</P>
<P>
   Laws said the rapid-burning fire, which consumed half of the
560-square-mile Hanford nuclear reservation in Washington in June,
forced the team more than once to set backfires. By deliberately
setting a fire, firefighters can create a safe area devoid of fuel
for the main fire.
</P>
<P>
   Lately the crew has been working at night -- when the
temperatures are cooler and the fire quieter -- to build fire lines
and try to keep blazes from reaching homes and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   But that makes sleep elusive in the heat of the day. Last week,
temperatures topped 95 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the crew continues its hard work.
</P>
<P>
   ''They go into an area where you're convinced there's no way a
line can be built,'' said fire information officer Linda Williams.
''Thirty minutes later they've cleared everything and built a wide
line. I don't think people realize that what they do is
backbreaking labor.''
</P>
<P>
   The St. Joe Hotshots average about 800 hours of overtime a year,
and each can work as many as 220 hours in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the location of the fires in the Bitterroot Valley,
many fire lines have had to be built on steep cliffs and high
ridges.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're not men, they're mountain goats,'' said Patrick
McGinty, a member of an Alaskan crew that has been working with the
Hotshots.
</P>
<P>
   One of the younger Hotshots, Kris Nelson, admitted his parents
are still waiting for him to get a ''real'' job.
</P>
<P>
   Pearson laughed. ''I've been saying that for 10 years, and I'm
still at it. By September, I almost hate it, at the end of a long
season. But March rolls around and I'm dusting the boots off ready
to go again.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The cast of Showtime's ''Resurrection Blvd.''
did more than just help get out the vote at the Latino Committee
2000 gathering Sunday at Paramount Pictures studios.
</P>
<P>
   They also got out the word on their critically acclaimed but
struggling TV series.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to get the message out to the community to watch
'Resurrection Blvd.,' to subscribe to Showtime,'' said actor Tony
Plano, who plays Roberto Santiago, the patriarch of a Hispanic
family.
</P>
<P>
   ''We as Hispanics are 11 percent of the population, but we're
only 2 to 3 percent of the TV population. We need this show,''
Plano said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Resurrection Blvd.,'' with one of the first all-Latino casts
on television, follows a family of boxers living in East Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Actors Mauricio Mendoza and Ruth Livier, who play siblings on
the show, couldn't decide how the fictional Santiago family would
react to the convention hoopla.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'd all be worrying about boxing,'' Mendoza said. But his
fictional sibling disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it would be the young generation -- my character and
Mauricio's character -- who would be rallying the family to get
involved,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The actors signed autographs and posed for pictures with
star-struck delegates, many of whom admitted they didn't have
Showtime on their TVs.
</P>
<P>
   But actor Esai Morales, also known for his roles opposite Lou
Diamond Phillips in ''La Bamba'' and Jimmy Smits in ''My Family,''

</P>
<P>
   From the red carpets laid out at the California Science Center
to the dirty cement sidewalks outside The Conga Room, the parade of
celebrities and politicians was nearly nonstop across town
Saturday, two days before the start of the Democratic National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Singer Harry Belafonte chatted with Rep. Maxine Waters,
D-Calif., at the African-American Committee 2000 and Beyond gala at
the Science Center. On the other side of the room, Gordy embraced
San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Some 450 people were tempted by soul food ranging from potato
pie to fried okra.
</P>
<P>
   While many were enjoying the black tie affair that also featured
singer Freda Payne and comedian Lewis Dix, most said they came not
for the partying but to support bringing more blacks into politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we're really on the brink of disaster in the 21st
century,'' Belafonte said. ''Despite a booming economy ... there
are a lot of disadvantaged people left out of the process. And most
of them are black.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Conga Room, a Hollywood nightclub and restaurant,
convention goers were invited to listen to Latin music with Joe

   A day after Rep. Loretta Sanchez, D-Calif., bowed to pressure
from the Democratic Party to cancel her Playboy mansion fund-raiser
for Hispanic voter registration, Hugh Hefner opened his lavish home
for the convention-attending news media.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbit-eared Playboy bunnies mingled with the media's most
influential, including CBS' Bryant Gumbel and comic talk show host
Bill Maher.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had someone ask me if I had to get CBS' permission to be
here. My answer was no, and I would never ask for permission,''
Gumbel said, standing next to a Playmates' swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   Maher, host of ABC's ''Politically Incorrect,'' joked that he
should have read his invitation more carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought I'd come here to relax,'' he said. ''I didn't
realize there would be all these journalists and I'd be working.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 500 guests, Arianna Huffington called the event a ''true
trade gathering.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems like everybody I've ever worked with (in the media)
is here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez caused consternation at the top levels of the Democratic
Party by deciding to hold the fund-raiser at Hefner's estate, famed
for its scantily clad women. She changed her mind Friday only after
convention organizers revoked her invitation to address the
gathering next week.
</P>
<P>
   Her speaking slot at the convention was reinstated.

   When ''Soul Train'' executive producer Don Cornelius calls, the
performers will come.
</P>
<P>
   Singer-songwriter Brian McKnight said after the negative
publicity he received for his performance at the Republican
National Convention in Philadelphia, he swore off future political
events.
</P>
<P>
   ''But when Don calls, you come,'' McKnight said.
</P>
<P>
   McKnight said he originally was supposed to sing following
President Clinton's speech at the Democratic convention Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ''But after the Republican convention, they called and said we
don't need you anymore,'' he said. ''If I performed in China, they
wouldn't call me a communist.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a convention gig, McKnight, who said he doesn't vote,
performed Sunday at the African-American Committee 2000 and Beyond
concert hosted by Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   He said his performance at the Los Angeles Sports Arena was
designed to help delegates relax.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody needs a chance to let it all hang out,'' he said.

   Actor Wayne Brady was star-struck.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the front row of the Divas and Kings concert, held
Sunday for Democratic convention delegates at the Los Angeles
Sports Arena, he said he was tied up in knots.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm kind of embarrassed. If they looked down they could see me
saying 'I love you,''' said Brady, who is a cast member with Drew
Carry on ABC-TV's ''Who's Line Is It Anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Brady said that backstage he was afraid to talk with the
performers, who included Patti LaBelle and Luther Vandross.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm really afraid if I do I'd ... make a big idiot of
myself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he planned to try to give LaBelle a hug.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   LaBelle lost her toe ring and decided to sing about it.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway through her rendition of ''Somewhere Over the Rainbow,''
the diva told the audience in song that the ring had fallen off.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh, I just lost my toe ring,'' she sang. ''My girl just gave
it to me tonight. I've got to find it.''
</P>
<P>
   As LaBelle continued to sing, she searched the stage for the
missing jewelry. She joked with the audience that it was covering a
corn on her toe. A stagehand who came onstage while she was singing
found the ring as she was finishing her number.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh, thank you. I wasn't leaving this stage without it,'' she
said.

   Following a three-year hiatus, R&AMP;B singing group Boyz II Men is
back to making music. This time at the Democratic National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   The four singers, who burst onto the music scene more than a
decade ago, took the last three years off.
</P>
<P>
   The group members said they performing at various convention
functions, including singing the National Anthem before Al Gore's
acceptance speech Thursday night to get the word out on two fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Singer Shawn Stockton said the group believed young people
needed to get involved and vote. But he also said the group's
appearance was to help boost its first new album in more than four
years.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want people to hear us. We just want to entertain people''
he said.

<HEADLINE> Paraguay Election Tests Nation  </HEADLINE>
By KEVIN GRAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) -- Early returns showed no clear leader
in Paraguay's vote for a successor to its slain vice president, an
election that could test the South American nation's weak
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Paraguayans voted Sunday for a successor to Luis Argana, whose
murder in March 1999 forced former President Raul Cubas to resign
and seek political asylum in Brazil. Cubas was suspected of being
involved in Argana's death.
</P>
<P>
   The new vice president will join President Luis Gonzalez Macchi,
the former Senate president who took office after Cubas was ousted
and who has seen his popularity plummet with economic downturns.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition candidate Julio Cesar Franco appeared to have a slim
lead in early returns Sunday, with 47.77 percent of the vote. The
son of the slain vice president, Felix Argana, had 46.93 percent.
Ballots had been counted from about 90 percent of polling stations
late Sunday, elections officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates claimed victory, pointing to polls conducted by
their own parties. They vowed to respect official election results,
which were to be announced Monday. Some 2 million Paraguayans were
eligible to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Paraguayans have never voted for a vice president outside of a
presidential election. Opposition members see it as a chance to
break the stranglehold of the Colorado Party, which has governed
Paraguay since 1947.
</P>
<P>
   Although tension had been predicted on election day, officials
reported no violence during the voting. Six people were killed in
rioting that followed Argana's murder.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from a balcony at Liberal Party headquarters, the
48-year-old Franco told some 5,000 supporters they were on the
verge of victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people have spoken in free, democratic and transparent
elections,'' he bellowed into a microphone, his neck wrapped in the
party's royal blue flag. ''I want to ask you all to vigilant as
they count the final votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Franco, a doctor, has suggested that if elected he would work to
have Macchi removed from office. A faction of the Colorado Party
has been strongly critical of Macchi, and Franco could look for
their support in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Faces were long at Colorado party headquarters. Argana, 43, had
earlier declared victory, citing his own party's exit polls. But in
the evening, he offered no comment. The Colorado party has ruled
Paraguay since 1947.
</P>
<P>
   Across town, Argana and his supporters appeared confident at
their party office, festooned in the Colorado colors of red and
white.
</P>
<P>
   An architect and Asuncion city councilman, the 43-year-old voted
Sunday morning after visiting his father's tomb. He has said he
does not intend to overshadow Macchi but to be a stabilizing force
in his troubled administration.
</P>
<P>
   Macchi's popularity has dipped to less than 20 percent as
Paraguay struggles through a grinding recession. He has refused to
hold an election to validate his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Argana's murder remains unsolved, although a
Paraguayan judge has accused Lino Oviedo, an army chief and former
political ally of Cubas, of masterminding the killing.
</P>
<P>
   A third candidate, Ricardo Buman of the Humanist Party, was
considered a long shot.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Role in Gore Race Mulled  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- There are two ways President Clinton can help
Al Gore win the White House after making a splashy, opening-night
speech at the Democratic convention Monday.
</P>
<P>
   One is to race around and campaign hard for Gore. The other is
to stay home and hope voters forget about him.
</P>
<P>
   Convention delegates are decidedly mixed about what the
president should do.
</P>
<P>
   In some places it would help to have Clinton boast about peace
and prosperity, delegates said. But in others he would cast a cloud
because of his affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if Clinton coming into Kentucky will be much of a
help to Al Gore's campaign,'' said state AFL-CIO president Bill
Londrigan. The president's stands on tobacco and guns are not
popular, added Robertson County tax assessor Karen Curtis.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia state Rep. Doug Teper of Atlanta said Clinton should
limit his campaigning. ''I don't think he sells for this race,''
Teper said. Paula Martinez, the mother of five in Carlisle, Iowa,
said Clinton wants to help ''but the negative image is there and it
is really sad.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mark Pocan, a businessman and member of the Wisconsin state
Legislature, said, ''I have heard a lot of people say if Bill
Clinton was running again they'd vote for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The president would be welcome in Florida, said Bob Poe,
chairman of the state Democratic Party. ''Clinton's a great
campaigner,'' Poe said. ''He still has high marks and his record as
president is strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Jo Anne Bowman, a state representative from Portland, Ore.,
said, ''I really think Al Gore needs to have Clinton come to Oregon
to remind people about how much this administration has done for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Thomas, an attorney in Tallulah, La., said, ''In certain
areas like New Orleans he will campaign for him and it will work
because Clinton is still strong in the black community.''
</P>
<P>
   As the convention opens, there's as much buzz about Clinton as
there is about Gore, who's supposed to be the star of the show.
</P>
<P>
   How can Gore emerge from Clinton's shadow -- particularly after
the president gives a convention speech that's sure to ignite a
frenzied celebration?
</P>
<P>
   ''He should know that he's the opening act and Gore's the
headliner now,'' said Vanderbilt University political scientist
Bruce Oppenheimer. ''The opening act gets the crowd enthused,
enjoying themselves, but doesn't step on the headliner.'' Clinton
should leave the memorable lines for Gore, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats are grumbling that Clinton is grabbing the
attention and soaking up campaign cash that the vice president
could use. Clinton and his Senate candidate-wife Hillary arrived
Friday for four days of Hollywood parties and tributes.
</P>
<P>
   Behind in the polls and still struggling to introduce himself to
the nation, Gore needs a spark for his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   If California becomes a battleground, the president could help,
drawing on his friends in Hollywood and his strong popularity here.
Washington state and Oregon are obvious targets for Clinton's
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   In a year in which voters say they do not like political rancor,
Clinton has a freer hand than Gore to attack Republicans. He also
can energize voters in targeted areas.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be a mistake to put him on the shelf,'' said
Democratic consultant Jim Duffy. ''He's too good. Yes, he's
controversial but you're not winning on your own. Pick your spots
where you use him. Certainly in Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland,
Pittsburgh, Philadelphia. Why wouldn't you put him in those big
urban areas where you've got labor, where you've got blacks, where
you've got some liberal progressive types?''
</P>
<P>
   But Duffy said Gore has to use Clinton judiciously.
</P>
<P>
   ''So you've got to learn to say, 'Bill, please just talk about
the future and what Al can do to continue the work that you have
done,'' Duffy said. ''And keep it on the issues. And by the way,
please don't get into any more of your personal redemption. If you
want to be an evangelist, wait until you leave office.'''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton caused a stir Thursday when, in a meeting with
evangelical ministers, he expressed remorse for his affair with
Lewinsky -- remarks that resurrected an episode that Americans would
like to forget. It also stole headlines from Gore and his running
mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Associated Press, White House Chief of
Staff John Podesta said his boss will use his convention speech to
counter GOP criticisms that he and Gore squandered eight years in
office and accomplished little.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Republicans may have had a little amnesia about where
things stood in 1992 and I think the president will be happy to
remind people about that and remind people of the kinds of efforts
he's made,'' Podesta said.

<HEADLINE> Verizon, unions spar over new proposal  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Verizon Communications and its unions remain
at odds over a new contract proposal on the table, dashing hopes
that thousands of telephone technicians and operators would soon
leave the picket lines and return to work.
</P>
<P>
   The company, seeking to resolve a strike that has dragged on
since Aug. 6, offered the unions what it called a ''revised
comprehensive offer'' early Sunday. But union negotiators quickly
denounced the offer, saying it failed to address such key issues as
mandatory overtime and the shifting of workloads to areas of
cheaper labor.
</P>
<P>
   On some points, the proposal represents a step backward, union
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Verizon had better put its energies into serious collective
bargaining if it wants to end this strike any time soon,'' warned
Morton Bahr, president of the Communications Workers of America -
the larger of the two unions bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials insisted that their offer did respond to
concerns raised by the unions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's certainly not fair or true that we have not addressed
these issues or taken them seriously,'' said Verizon spokesman Eric
Rabe. He added that the issues ''are all interlocking pieces'' that
have to be looked at together.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials asserted that the proposal did not address key
points, such as shifting of work by Verizon from the former Bell
Atlantic territory to GTE's region. Verizon, the nation's largest
local telephone company, is the product of a summer marriage
between those two companies.
</P>
<P>
   CWA bargainers said the only company proposal addressing
overtime - related to the definition of a ''reasonable excuse'' for
turning down forced overtime - would weaken workers' existing
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon says its lenient policy allowing employees to call in on
the same day they take off drives the need to require employees to
work overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The unions also asserted that the company is seeking concessions
regarding job stress for employees in call centers. According to
CWA, Verizon wants to limit to 1.5 percent the number of workers
that can transfer each month. Union officials argue this traps
customer service representatives and consultants in high-pressure
jobs without opportunities for movement.
</P>
<P>
   The company says that it in call centers with heavy volumes,
excessive transfer of employees would exacerbate staffing problems.
</P>
<P>
   The back-and-forth comes as the two sides seek to reach new
contracts for 87,000 Verizon workers. The company says it will not
call in federal mediators so long as the parties make some progress
in their talks. The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers
is striking along with CWA.
</P>
<P>
   The company's 30,000 managers have jumped in to tackle a daily
running total of 90,000 repair orders, a problem boosted because of
inclement weather in parts of the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, 4,800 Puerto Rican telephone workers - who have been
bargaining for several months with the former GTE, now Verizon -
plan informational pickets and ''collective actions'' to show their
solidarity with the striking employees in the East. Those
employees, members of the Independent Union of Telephone Workers,
are working without a contract.
</P>
<P>
   The strike affects Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New
Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,
Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia and Washington, D.C.

<HEADLINE> Dole Salutes WWII Veterans  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Bob Dole led the Illinois State Fair
crowd in a chorus of ''Happy Birthday'' for a fellow veteran who
got an unexpected present -- medals for his World War II service.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was surprised,'' said an obviously pleased Thomas Ryder, 81,
of Sunday's ceremony. ''I knew nothing about this deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole, who was badly wounded in World War II, also received a
check for $987,000 -- the state's contribution to a national World
War II memorial in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Ryder received good conduct, victory and campaign medals. Four
other veterans also collected medals they never received after
their tours of duty.
</P>
<P>
   Often, medals weren't awarded because soldiers didn't take the
time to fill out the required paperwork at the war's conclusion.

<HEADLINE> Acupuncture May Help Cocaine Addicts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- Acupuncture is an effective treatment
for those addicted to cocaine, Yale researchers found.
</P>
<P>
   A study published in Monday's Archives of Internal Medicine
reports that patients who received therapeutic acupuncture
treatments, along with counseling, were more likely to have
cocaine-negative tests than those who didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our study shows that that alternative therapies can be
combined with the arsenal of Western treatments for fighting
addiction,'' said Yale Medical School researcher Arthur Margolin.
</P>
<P>
   Of the patients studied, 53.8 percent of those receiving the
acupuncture technique tested free of cocaine during the last week
of the treatment, compared with 23.5 percent and 9.1 percent in the
two control groups.
</P>
<P>
   Those who completed the acupuncture treatment also had longer
periods of sustained abstinence than participants in either control
group.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-week study involved 82 participants who were addicted
to heroin and cocaine. They received methadone for their heroin
addiction, but no medication for their cocaine addiction.
</P>
<P>
   All participants received individual and group counseling. They
were divided into three groups.
</P>
<P>
   One group received auricular acupuncture, in which needles are
inserted into specific places in the outer ear thought to be
associated with addiction.
</P>
<P>
   A second control group received acupuncture in other points
along the outer ear believed to have no treatment effect.
</P>
<P>
   The third group was shown videotapes depicting relaxing images,
such as nature scenes.
</P>
<P>
   While the scientific basis for acupuncture is unknown, the
results are indisputable, said Daniel Iead, clinical coordinator
for the Grant Street Partnership, a New Haven addiction services
agency.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been doing it here for years and it works,'' said Iead.
''The results are fantastic. Some of our most difficult cases have
turned their lives around because of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Margolin said the findings also were encouraging because
acupuncture has fewer side effects and is relatively low-cost. He
said the results suggest the need for increased study of
acupuncture and other forms of alternative medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ''Controlled clinical research of acupuncture is in its infancy,
and while our positive findings are gratifying, further research is
needed to replicate the results and to better understand how to
combine acupuncture with existing treatments for addiction,''
Margolin said.

<HEADLINE> Paraguay Election Results Postponed  </HEADLINE>
By KEVIN GRAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) -- The release of final results in
Paraguay's vote for a successor to slain vice president Luis Argana
has been postponed for days because the balloting was so close,
election officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials suspended the release of official results late Sunday
after 90 percent of the vote had been counted, saying they wanted
to closely monitor the tallying of the remaining ballots.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since the difference is very slim, we will need to verify the
vote to avoid any possibilities of fraud,'' said Carlos Maria
Ljubetic, a spokesman for the election board. ''We will have a
definitive result in the next 10 to 12 days,''
</P>
<P>
   Early returns showed no clear leader in the vote for a successor
to Argana -- an election that could test the South American nation's
weak democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition candidate Julio Cesar Franco appeared to hold a slim
lead in early returns Sunday, with 47.77 percent of the ballot.
Felix Argana, the son of the slain vice president, had 46.93
percent.
</P>
<P>
   If the results hold, it would be the first electoral defeat for
the ruling Colorado Party, which has dominated politics for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1 million Paraguayans voted Sunday for a successor to
Argana, whose assassination in March 1999 forced former President
Raul Cubas to resign and seek political asylum in Brazil. Cubas was
suspected of being involved in Argana's death.
</P>
<P>
   The new vice president will join President Luis Gonzalez Macchi,
the former Senate president who took office after Cubas was ousted
and who has seen his popularity plummet with an economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
   Although tension had been predicted on election day, officials
reported no violence during the voting. Six people were killed in
rioting that followed Argana's murder.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from a balcony at Liberal Party headquarters, the
48-year-old Franco told some 5,000 supporters they were on the
verge of victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people have spoken in free, democratic and transparent
elections,'' he bellowed into a microphone, his neck wrapped in the
party's royal blue flag. ''I want to ask you all to vigilant as
they count the final votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Franco, a doctor, has suggested that if elected he would work to
have Macchi removed from office. A faction of the Colorado Party
has been strongly critical of Macchi, and Franco could look for
their support in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Faces were long at Colorado party headquarters. Argana, 43, had
earlier declared victory, citing his own party's exit polls. But in
the evening, he offered no comment. The Colorado party has ruled
Paraguay since 1947.
</P>
<P>
   Across town, Argana and his supporters appeared confident at
their party office, festooned in the Colorado colors of red and
white.
</P>
<P>
   An architect and Asuncion city councilman, the 43-year-old voted
Sunday morning after visiting his father's tomb. He has said he
does not intend to overshadow Macchi but to be a stabilizing force
in his troubled administration.
</P>
<P>
   Macchi's popularity has dipped to less than 20 percent as
Paraguay struggles through a grinding recession. He has refused to
hold an election to validate his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Argana's murder remains unsolved, although a
Paraguayan judge has accused Lino Oviedo, an army chief and former
political ally of Cubas, of masterminding the killing.
</P>
<P>
   A third candidate, Ricardo Buman of the Humanist Party, was
considered a long shot.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Military Stays in Politics  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL COONEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Despite angry protesters' calls for
the military to get out of politics, Indonesia's highest
legislature looked set Monday to allow the armed forces to keep
their parliamentary seats.
</P>
<P>
   The People's Consultative Assembly committee recommended that
the military's withdrawal from national politics be delayed for
five years, until 2009. The committee's recommendation will be
considered Friday by the full assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's chairman, Rambe Kamarulzaman, said the major
political parties have agreed to allow the armed forces to retain
their 38 seats in the 700-member assembly, the country's top
lawmaking body, for a further nine years.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the security forces will lose their voice in
parliament by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the once all-powerful military held considerable
political sway, but has since seen its power-base reduced by
President Abdurrahman Wahid's civilian-led administration.
</P>
<P>
   Some legislators have said they are being railroaded by powerful
generals, who are threatening to foment trouble in strife-torn
Aceh, Maluku and West Papua provinces unless they are allowed to
retain a political role.
</P>
<P>
   But leading military analyst Salim Said said the move was more
of a reflection of Indonesia's weak civilian-led government, rather
than a push by the military to retain its voice in the assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister Juwono Sudarsono told reporters on Monday that
the armed forces will not attempt to retain their assembly seats
after 2009.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the legislature on Monday, dozens of student protesters,
carrying banners reading ''Get the military back to the barracks,''
called on the armed forces to get out of politics.
</P>
<P>
   Another band of protesters called for former dictator Suharto to
be tried for corruption. Others called on lawmakers to support
Wahid's administration.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in little except traditional gourds, pro-independence
activists from remote West Papua province waved separatist flags.
</P>
<P>
   The mood was festive and several police officers stood by but
did not intervene.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Indonesia, five people were killed in fresh
violence in strife-torn Aceh province.
</P>
<P>
   The latest violence increased the death toll to 55 since a
three-month truce between the government and the separatists came
into effect in June.
</P>
<P>
   The Free Aceh Movement has been waging a 25-year battle to
separate the oil- and natural gas-rich region on the northern tip
of Sumatra Island from the rest of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   And in western Sumatra, a mob burned to death three men they
accused of stealing sheep, police said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia has been hit by widespread civil unrest and
lawlessness in recent years because of economic hardship, political
turbulence and ethnic and religious tensions.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were modestly higher in early trading
Monday, as wary investors tried to reconcile positive economic news
with fears of a second-half earnings slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   In morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 6.60 at 11,034.40.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 2.62 at 1,474.46, and the
Nasdaq composite index was up 10.73 at 3,800.20.
</P>
<P>
   Two retail giants helped lift the Dow index. Wal Mart Stores was
up $1.25 at $52.813 and Home Depot shares rose $1.625 to $57.563.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications parts maker Ciena Corp., up $5.625 to
$161.75, led the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   Blue-chip stocks rose last week on encouraging inflation data,
including a Labor Department report that showed that wholesale
prices remained virtually the same in July after a huge jump in
June caused by soaring energy costs. The Dow index closed above
11,000 Friday for the first time since April 25.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have kept pressure on technology stocks, however, in
the wake of warnings from some widely held companies that earnings
could fall in the second half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Those conflicting dynamics have left investors with no clear
motivation to either buy or sell stocks. The result has been that
stocks have mostly fluctuated from day to day without breaking out
in any one direction.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market is in the midst of tentative trading. On balance,
this is a market attempting to find a footing,'' said Alan
Ackerman, chief investment strategist Fahnestock Inc. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're basically on hold until the Federal Reserve Board
meeting on Aug. 22,'' he added. ''Investors are watching and
waiting. We need to work our way through the uncertainty of what
the Fed will do.''
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues slightly outnumbered decliners on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 239.22 million shares, down
from Friday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 1.58 at 511.85.

<HEADLINE> Man's Eye Cut Out As Punishment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- Sobbing and expressing regret for
his actions, an Egyptian man had his left eye surgically removed in
the first eye-for-an-eye punishment in Saudi Arabia in over 40
years, a newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Abdel Moati Abdel Rahman Mohammed, 37, an Egyptian, was
convicted of disfiguring a compatriot by throwing acid on his face.
He had his left eye removed last week in a hospital in the western
city of Medina.
</P>
<P>
   The punishment was carried out despite offers to pay $213,000 to
the victim, Shihata Ajami Mahmoud, the daily Okaz said.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed threw acid on Mahmoud's face following an argument over
money in 1996. In addition to the removal of his eye, he was fined
$68,800 and ordered to serve an undisclosed prison term, the paper
reported.
</P>
<P>
   It said Mahmoud, 35, has undergone more than 30 reconstructive
operations. His face remains disfigured and he continues to suffer
emotionally from the scars.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed sobbed before the punishment was carried out and
acknowledged his crime. ''I did wrong to myself and to the victim
and I deserve the punishment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia's strict interpretation of Islamic law calls for
cutting off the hands and feet of thieves. Murderers, rapists, drug
traffickers and armed robbers are beheaded. In some cases, victims
can either demand retributive punishment or accept monetary
compensation.

<HEADLINE> NATO Takes Over Kosovo Mine Complex  </HEADLINE>
By ALISON MUTLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZVECAN, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO-led peacekeepers took control of
a Serb-run mining complex in the northern part of Kosovo on Monday
in a pre-dawn raid likely to heighten tensions in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of NATO-led peacekeepers cordoned off the
200-square-yard area around a massive smelting complex that U.N.
officials claimed was spewing dangerous amounts of lead into the
atmosphere. Clouds of smoke belched from aging chimneys while
Italian police and soldiers from France, Britain, Belgium and
Denmark swept in.
</P>
<P>
   Serb sources say as many as 800 NATO troops took part in the
takeover, though NATO sources put the number slightly higher.
Kosovo Serb leader Oliver Ivanovic said plant workers told him NATO
troops ''just appeared out of nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of workers were on hand when the operation began
at 3:45 a.m., Ivanovic said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO-led peacekeepers -- some wearing face masks because of the
smoke -- came within yards of the crumbling communist-era complex
before being stopped on a footbridge leading into the facility.
After hours of negotiations with plant officials, peacekeepers took
over, U.N. spokesman Michael Keats said.
</P>
<P>
   One security guard was slightly injured in a scuffle with
peacekeepers when he resisted NATO's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Serb residents protesting the takeover threw stones at
NATO troops. A couple of journalists were roughed up in the
scuffle. Three British soldiers were slightly injured, said NATO
spokeswoman Kath Hurley.
</P>
<P>
   NATO had no reports of civilian casualties, but the
Belgrade-based Beta independent news agency said a Serb man and
child were injured in a scuffle with British troops.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Kouchner, Kosovo's top U.N. administrator, stressed that
the closure was only temporary, and workers would return to work
''as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Kouchner said the takeover was necessary to end a health risk,
adding 160 people had been hospitalized in the past year for
treatment for lead poisoning. Last week, U.N. officials said lead
levels from the plant were 200 times World Health Organization
norms.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a doctor and as chief administrator of Kosovo, I would be
derelict if I let this threat to the health of children and
pregnant women continue for one more day,'' Kouchner said in a
written statement.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav Information Minister Goran Matic protested the NATO
action, calling it a ''robbery'' and violation of a U.N. resolution
that allowed the troops to operate in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is an anti-Serb demonstration of power against unarmed
people,'' Matic told the state-run Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Trepca is an emotional symbol for the people of this southern
Serb province, who are struggling to rebuild after the 78-day NATO
air war aimed at forcing Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to
end his repression of ethnic Albanian residents.
</P>
<P>
   The main employer of Serbs in the industrial north until last
year, the smelter is part of the Trepca mining complex, a group of
about 40 mines that produce gold, silver, lead, zinc and cadmium.

<HEADLINE> SKorea May Alter Anti-Communist Law  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Seeking to nurture newfound
communication with Pyongyang, President Kim Dae-jung said Monday
that South Korea plans to revise its national security law that
defines the communist North as an enemy state.
</P>
<P>
   In Seoul's city center on Monday, a few hundred leftist students
clashed with riot police, demanding the withdrawal of 37,000 U.S.
troops stationed here. Witnesses said about a dozen students were
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The security law calls North Korea an enemy state and bars any
activities that may help it. That makes it a crime punishable by
long prison terms to possess even Marxist literature.
</P>
<P>
   ''With a public consensus, I want to revise the national
security law to conform with the changing reality,'' Kim said in a
statement marking the 55th anniversary of Korea's liberation from
Japan's colonial rule on Aug. 15, 1945.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, critics at home and abroad accused successive South
Korean military governments of using the security law to suppress
political dissent.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the U.S. State Department has joined the
London-based Amnesty International and the U.N. Human Rights
Committee in demanding revision of the law, calling it
''undemocratic and anti-human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   North Korea also demands revision of the law, arguing that it
hinders inter-Korea exchanges. President Kim's previous efforts to
change the law failed in the face of the nation's strong
conservative voice.
</P>
<P>
   But a new conciliatory mood has set in since leaders of the two
Koreas held a historic summit in June. The leaders pledged then to
work toward reconciliation and unification.
</P>
<P>
   President Kim himself was a target of suppression under the law.
In 1980, Kim, then an opposition leader, faced sedition charges and
was sentenced to death. He was freed on a stay of the sentence and
pardoned in a government amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean conservatives insist that the security law must be
kept intact unless North Korea changes its version of the law.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting with 46 South Korean media executives on a rare
visit to his country on Saturday, North Korean leader Kim Jong Il
expressed a willingness to revise the similar North Korean law.
</P>
<P>
   In the Liberation Day statement, Kim Dae-jung said inter-Korea
relations will continue to improve as the two Korean governments
have a strong common will to pursue detente.
</P>
<P>
   ''Reconciliation and cooperation between South and North Korea
is a call of the era,'' Kim Dae-jung said. ''It is a prerequisite
to the coexistence, peace and prosperity of our people.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim warned that other options -- any attempt by Pyongyang to
communize South Korea or any move by Seoul to absorb North Korea
for unification -- would lead to war.
</P>
<P>
   Kim also said the U.S. military presence in South Korea is
necessary to maintain peace on the volatile Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Protesting students argued that the U.S. presence blocks
unification of the two Koreas.

<HEADLINE> Twitch City: a Comedy About TV  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Television shows have always been more
interested in people who make TV than people who watch it.
</P>
<P>
   Series that mirror TV's own insiders range from such classics as
''The Dick Van Dyke Show'' and ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' to
Showtime's current ''Beggars and Choosers,'' which lampoons the
execs of a struggling TV network, and the new CBS fall sitcom
''Welcome to New York,'' which will focus on a TV weathercaster
very much like the young David Letterman.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, when it bothers to reflect upon its audience, TV's
brain trust typically pictures a viewer as someone who is lazy,
lowbrow, maybe even deranged.
</P>
<P>
   Just consider these couch potatoes from TV present and past:
Doug Heffernan on ''The King of Queens,'' Al Bundy on ''Married ...
With Children,'' Homer Simpson, Beavis and Butt-head.
</P>
<P>
   You get the point.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes ''Twitch City'' with the last word on sofa spuds.
</P>
<P>
   A shrewd, funny comedy, ''Twitch City'' has a rabid following in
Canada, where it was produced and first seen. Now it's your turn.
The 13 half-hours will air two per week at 10 p.m. Eastern on Bravo
starting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Couch potatoes won't exactly feel flattered by the portrait of
Curtis, a Toronto twentysomething whose IQ is debatable but who
surely qualifies as lazy and deranged.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, in the hands of ''Twitch City'' writer-creator Don
McKellar (who also stars as Curtis), chronic TV-watching is
characterized with long-overdue respect.
</P>
<P>
   For Curtis, watching television isn't an addiction, it's a fact
of life, like gravity, and a physiological obligation, like
breathing. It's an out-of-body reverie equipped with a remote.
</P>
<P>
   In the castoffs-furnished bachelor flat that he never leaves,
Curtis watches TV all the time. His TV and the FrootyO's cereal on
which he subsists provide the only color in his world. But that's
plenty for him.
</P>
<P>
   His other needs are met no less successfully. As the series
begins, Curtis supports his lifestyle by subletting a spare room to
Nathan, who, in turn, invites his girlfriend Hope to move in.
</P>
<P>
   Any TV watcher can foresee how this could be a household rife
with comic possibilities. After all, Nathan (Daniel MacIvor) is a
prig who disapproves of Curtis in every way. Hope (Molly Parker) is
a soft touch who is desperate to see normality in even the
strangest situation. (''I've stayed in places way worse than
this,'' she insists when Nathan blows up over Curtis' lack of
housekeeping.)
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget Curtis' TV, wherein reside his virtual
flatmates, in particular Rex Reilly, the host of a daytime talk
show. As played by ''The Kids in the Hall'' alum Bruce McCulloch,
Rex is a robotic-mannered hybrid of Jerry Springer and Geraldo as
he wallows in such topics as ''I Slept With My Mother'' and ''I
Look Like Joyce DeWitt.''
</P>
<P>
   It's Curtis' TV that provides the electronic twitch for ''Twitch
City,'' a teeming undercurrent to the embattled calm, the pent-up
eeriness that lives outside the tube.
</P>
<P>
   Eerie? Midway through the first episode, Nathan disappears.
Ninety minutes pass and he still isn't back from his trip to the
corner grocery. Turns out he's been jailed for inadvertently
killing a vagrant with a sack of cat food.
</P>
<P>
   When this news reaches Curtis, he uncharacteristically swings
into action: He rents out Nathan's room. To a pair of
suspicious-acting Asians wearing trench coats. Who fill the room
with crates of pineapple-almond cookies.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why do these cookies take priority over me?'' asks Hope on
finding herself room-less.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis proposes that she move into the hall closet.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Hope resists. Although Curtis insists on calling it
the guest room, Hope observes that not only is the room awfully
tiny, but it has a bar across it for hanging clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ''You could put a bar across the Sistine Chapel,'' Curtis
argues. ''Would that make it a closet?''
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes,'' Hope replies. ''A really big closet with a great paint
job.''
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, she relents.
</P>
<P>
   No less craftily does ''Twitch City'' win over its audience. A
closet? A guest room? The Sistine Chapel? The difference is only a
matter of degree.
</P>
<P>
   In short, expect to see at least a little of yourself in Curtis
and the world he occupies. But any similarity, however much it
makes you twitch, is too funny to worry about. Especially when
Curtis and Hope eat those cookies.

movies, called for tougher enforcement of theaters' voluntary
ratings policy. This long-standing policy forbids anyone under 17

<HEADLINE> N., S. Korea Prepare for Reunions  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Frail husbands and wives meeting for
the first time in more than 50 years. Sons and daughters greeting
parents lost across a militarized border. Separated in childhood,
brothers and sisters, now elderly, embracing yet again.
</P>
<P>
   In an event that promises tears of joy and anguish for Koreans
on both sides of the border, a tiny fraction of the victims of a
Cold War-era conflict that separated millions will reunite briefly
with loved ones this week.
</P>
<P>
   One hundred people from North Korea were to fly to South Korea
on Tuesday, and an equal number of South Koreans will head north in
the most emotionally charged dividend of a historic June summit
between the two countries' leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't describe how I feel,'' Choi Soon-nam, an 87-year-old
South Korean who will meet her 60-year-old son in the communist
North, said Monday. ''I have so much to say to him. But when I
actually see him, I may not be able to say anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The four-day reunion is as much a political event as it is a
humanitarian one, a good will gesture between two nations that have
taken bigger steps toward reconciliation in the last two months
than at any time since the 1950-53 Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   There will be euphoria, and also reminders of the pain and
permanent loss of separation, when the separated family members
meet under the glare of television lights in a Seoul convention
center.
</P>
<P>
   A 99-year-old South Korean is unlikely to recognize her son from
the North because she is mentally ill. A 61-year-old man was so
excited to hear his older brother would visit the South that he
fell ill and was hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Jang-soo, a 68-year-old former North Korean soldier who was
captured in the Korean War and settled in the South, will meet his
two sisters when he travels to the North's capital of Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I get there, I want to find out when my mother passed
away. I told my mother I would return in three years. And it became
50 years,'' said Kim, whose gifts for his family include rings,
watches, socks, underwear and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Family reunions are a pressing issue because many aging family
members have only a few years left to see relatives. Many people
have died without making contact with relatives. There is no mail,
telephone or other direct means of communication between private
citizens in the two Koreas.
</P>
<P>
   Seoul and Pyongyang organized family reunions in 1985, but
political acrimony undercut efforts to organize another round. Ties
remain so delicate that family members who will travel north are
under strict instructions to avoid talking politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''Please be careful in what you say and how you behave,'' Yang
Young-shik, vice minister of Seoul's Unification Ministry, told
family members at a briefing at a five-star hotel Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Staff at the hotel, which will house the North Korean group,
have removed imported Western goods such as liquor and replaced
them with traditional Korean drinks to avoid unsettling their
guests.
</P>
<P>
   At a banquet Monday at the Blue House presidential residence,
President Kim Dae-jung told the family members -- some carrying
canes or stooped with age -- that reconciliation and eventual
reunification would be a lengthy process. But he said the reunions
this week would not be an isolated event.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will have more visits, open a permanent reunion office,
exchange letters and visit our hometowns,'' Kim said. ''Whether you
settle in the North or South, you must be reunited with your
family.''
</P>
<P>
   The government gave $500 to each family member to buy gifts for
relatives in the impoverished North, Kim announced.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rapprochement between the Koreas, uneasiness lingers
in the South over apparent political use of the event by the North.
</P>
<P>
   While South Korea chose its 100 finalists for the reunions
through a computer lottery, the North Korean list includes a
renowned poet, a painter, a film maker, a scientist and other
celebrated people. And all the Northern visitors are natives of
South Korea who defected to the North.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean critics said loyalty to the communist system
appeared to be the most important criterion for getting on the
North's list.

<HEADLINE> Charity Eyes French for Vasectomies  </HEADLINE>
By JILL LAWLESS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- For men in France, obtaining a vasectomy has long
been all but impossible, thanks to a 200-year-old Napoleonic law
prohibiting self-mutilation.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a new cross-channel ''vasectomy tourism service'' set up by
a British sexual health charity aims to cut the complications in
obtaining the birth control procedure.
</P>
<P>
   The service, launched Monday by Marie Stopes International, is
targeting Frenchmen with the offer of a vasectomy for $300 at one
of its clinics in London or Ashford -- both stops on the Eurostar
rail line from Paris -- and the suggestion the operation be
incorporated into a day trip to Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the spirit of European togetherness, MSI is offering
vasectomy to our French neighbors,'' Marie Stopes marketing manager
Julie Douglas said. ''We also hope to raise awareness about the
archaic penal codes which limit reproductive choice in France.''
</P>
<P>
   Although no one has been prosecuted for getting a vasectomy for
more than 40 years, the procedure is technically illegal in France
under the Napoleonic Code.
</P>
<P>
   Few French doctors will perform the operation and only two
hospitals in the country offer vasectomies, Marie Stopes
spokeswoman Franca Tranza said. The procedure involves sealing the
tubes that carry sperm from the scrotum to the penis.
</P>
<P>
   United Nations statistics list the rate of the procedure in
France as ''nil or negligible.''
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, which has the world's highest vasectomy rate, 16
percent of men of reproductive age have had the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, two of France's leading newspapers -- Le Monde and Le
Figaro -- rejected an advertisement promoting the Marie Stopes
service, branding it ''disgraceful.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent ad designed for the Paris subway featuring a playfully
altered version of Napoleon's classic hand-in-jacket pose -- his
hand wasn't in his jacket -- also was turned down.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Schnakenbourg, 47, a father of one from the Essone
region near Paris, was the first to have the operation Monday at
Marie Stopes' headquarters in London.
</P>
<P>
   Schnakenbourg said he was satisfied with the five-minute
procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it is only fair that couples share the responsibility
for contraception within a relationship,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Stopes now plans to promote its vasectomies on the
Internet and through an e-mail campaign to French doctors.
</P>
<P>
   According to the United Nations, about 50 million men worldwide
have had a vasectomy -- roughly 5 percent of all men of reproductive
age.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear whether circumcisions are also prohibited by the
Napoleonic Code, but the procedure is not common in French public
hospitals because of the legal uncertainties. The procedure is done
at private hospitals.

<HEADLINE> Diplomats Seek Meeting in Yugoslavia  </HEADLINE>
By KATARINA KRATOVAC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Diplomats on Monday protested
Yugoslav authorities' refusal to let them meet in private with two
Britons and two Canadians jailed by the Yugoslav army, which calls
them suspected terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, countries allow diplomats to meet privately with
detainees. But ''this is not a full-fledged consular access because
it's not in private and it's always in the presence of an
investigator,'' said British diplomat Robert Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav army officials say they found explosives-related
materials in the men's car when it was stopped Aug. 1 at an army
checkpoint in Montenegro, which along with Serbia makes up
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The men had been working in the Serbian province of Kosovo,
occupied by NATO-led peacekeepers after NATO's 78-day bombing
campaign against Yugoslavia last year. They four said they were in
Montenegro for vacation.
</P>
<P>
   If found guilty of terrorism, they could be sentenced to up to
15 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Britons Adrian Prangnell and John Yore trained police officers
in Kosovo for the Organization of Security and Cooperation in
Europe. Canadian Shaun Going and his nephew Liam Hall were
rebuilding homes damaged by the war, U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The men have not yet been formally charged and have denied any
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Pretrial proceedings continued Monday at a military court in
Belgrade, a defense attorney told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Based on the testimonies we've heard so far, they have no
case,'' attorney Djordje Djurisic said. ''The investigation is now
over, it's now up to the military prosecutor to decide whether to
file charges or drop the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon and Canadian diplomat Craig Bale met with the four men
Monday for the fourth time since they were detained. ''They are
fine, they are coping and are very grateful for the support they
are getting,'' from family and friends, Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney defending the two Canadians, Ivan Jankovic, told
reporters that he feared the ''decision whether to file charges
will not be judicially independent but a political'' one.
</P>
<P>
   They arrests followed Yugoslav allegations that NATO has hired
mercenaries to detain fugitive war crimes suspects. Milosevic has
been indicted by the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague,
Netherlands, on charges he is responsible for atrocities in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> India Braces for More Attacks  </HEADLINE>
By NEELESH MISRA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SRINAGAR, India (AP) -- Security forces turned Srinagar into a
garrison town Monday, the eve of India's independence day, as they
sought to prevent further rebel attacks like the car bombing that
killed 14 people last week.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of soldiers, paramilitary troops and police spread
across Srinagar, summer capital of disputed Kashmir, and other
areas vulnerable to attack by Islamic guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are in a war zone. We are taking all precautions,'' said
Kul Bhushan Jandial, the state government's chief spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Kashmir is the focus of an Islamic insurgency that has killed at
least 25,000 people in the past 11 years. More than a dozen
militant groups have been fighting Indian forces, demanding
independence or Kashmir's merger with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, three soldiers and five civilians were wounded in two
incidents in the Himalayan state. The attacks came a day after two
land mines killed six soldiers, 10 rebels died in gun battles with
government troops and three explosions injured 42 other people.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpshooters took positions Monday overlooking Bakshi Stadium
in Srinagar, where Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah, Kashmir's top
elected leader, was to give a speech Tuesday. Police fear rocket
attacks on the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers wearing bulletproof vests and helmets inspected cars at
checkpoints and looked for bombs under cars in parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cars have been stolen. Some of them could be used by the
militants in such attacks,'' Chavang Phunsog, Kashmir's principal
home secretary, told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Girish Chandra Saxena, the federal representative in
Kashmir, acknowledged human rights excesses by security forces in
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   ''This problem is inherent in the prevailing circumstances,
which have been created by the terrorist and their foreign
mentors,'' Saxenna said in a statement. He urged security forces to
''take care to minimize civilian casualties or losses.''
</P>
<P>
   Separatist guerrillas in the Kashmir Valley have observed
India's Independence Day as a ''Black Day'' since 1989. India
accuses neighboring Pakistan of fomenting and backing the
militancy, a charge Pakistan denies.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan President Rafiq Tarar said in an address Monday -- the
day his country celebrates independence from Britain -- that
Islamabad would continue to support the struggle in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, hopes for peace rose when Hezb-ul Mujahedeeen, the
main militant group, announced a cease-fire and the Indian
government responded by suspending its offensives.
</P>
<P>
   But peace talks fell through when India refused a demand to
include Pakistan in the discussions. The Hezb-ul Mujahedeen broke
the cease-fire with a car bomb in downtown Srinagar that killed 13
soldiers and a journalist and wounded 25 other people Aug. 8.
</P>
<P>
   India holds two-thirds of Kashmir and Pakistan the rest. The
hostile nuclear armed neighbors have fought two wars for control of
Kashmir since they won independence from Britain in 1947.

<HEADLINE> Effort to understand 1776 battle leads to charting Lake Champlain site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VALCOUR, N.Y. (AP) - Divers have begun charting a historic New
York lake that was the site of a 1776 battle.
</P>
<P>
   ''Weve already completed an exhaustive examination of the
historical and archival records of the battle,'' said Arthur Cohn,
executive director for the Lake Champlain Maritime Museum in Basin
Harbor, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now were adding an archaeological study to that history to
better understand and preserve the area for future generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Using metal detectors, about 14 divers are mapping the silty
lake bottom, identifying any objects they might pick up buried in
the mud around Valcour, about 140 miles north of Albany.
</P>
<P>
   ''Its a pretty tedious but straightforward process,'' Cohn said.
''If you think about a battlefield above ground, were trying to do
that same kind of study under water by determining what objects
might still remain there.''
</P>
<P>
   Divers are cataloging the items they find but all objects are
staying on the lake bottom, organizers said. The cool, fresh water
and silty bottom are perfect environments for protecting the
artifacts until a plan can be devised for preserving and displaying
them in a public setting.
</P>
<P>
   ''As divers, we get to look at these objects first-hand,'' said
former Plattsburgh City Police Chief Matthew Booth, one of the
volunteer divers working on the project. ''But if we can recover
these artifacts and put them on display, then everyone gets a
chance to appreciate and study them.
</P>
<P>
   ''They belong to everybody, not just the city or county or state
of New York,'' Booth said. ''This is a regional effort. Lake
Champlain is a corridor where a lot of important history took
place. Its everybodys job to preserve that.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to American and British cannons, bayonets and
ammunition, the survey is also identifying the human aspect of the
battle. For instance, one of the objects surveyed is a cartridge
box that still has part of the leather cover and clear initials,
''GMB,'' of the man who used it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Its very exciting,'' added Tony Tyrell, who works for the
Department of Environmental Conservation as the Valcour Island
caretaker.
</P>
<P>
   ''This area almost takes on a sacred graveyard atmosphere,'' he
said. These men were our forefathers. Theyre why were not paying
tea taxes today.''

<HEADLINE> Freed Colombia Hostage Has 1 Regret  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW SELSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- American biologist John Lynch emerged
from captivity at the hands of leftist rebels with one regret: he
did not find a caecilian -- a giant wormlike creature he's been
hunting for years in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   To one of the world's authorities on amphibians, Colombia is
heaven; it has more of the creatures than anywhere else. But with
guerrilla armies, government forces and right-wing paramilitaries
battling for control of this South American nation, it's also one
of the world's most dangerous places.
</P>
<P>
   That means the Iowa native's quest to find new species sometimes
lands him in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The latest scrape for the former University of Nebraska
professor came last week, when guerrillas snatched him and 25
Colombian colleagues in the Andes Mountains and ''detained'' them
for three days until freeing them Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   In his first extensive interview since being released, Lynch
told The Associated Press on Sunday that rebels of the National
Liberation Army, or ELN, had treated his group well, and in fact
may have been worried about their safety.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities who contracted the scientific team to catalog flora
and fauna in the Andes in western Colombia had neglected to let the
ELN, which controls the area, know the group was coming, said
Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   When the group arrived Aug. 7 in the village of San Miguel, the
rebels came and asked what the group was doing. The team, composed
of professors and students from the National University in Bogota,
was frisked for weapons. Then the rebels left.
</P>
<P>
   They returned Wednesday and told the scientific team to
accompany them into the virgin forest. For hours, they stumbled
along in the dark. The rain forest became alive with the sounds of
nocturnal animals.
</P>
<P>
   ''I could hear the frogs calling, and thought, 'Damn, there's no
way to catch them,''' Lynch recalled.
</P>
<P>
   At a rebel camp deep in the forest, the weary team collapsed
into sleeping bags. The next day, the local ELN boss, Comandante
Javier, told the group they were not kidnapped but ''detained.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought at first it was a pretty silly distinction,'' Lynch
said. ''As a group we discussed what to do. We couldn't try to run
because some of us were not in shape.''
</P>
<P>
   The scientists decided to sit tight. Javier then allowed them to
collect biological samples, under guard.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch had been questioning the rebels about the presence of
caecilians, nocturnal creatures that are as thick as a man's index
finger and can grow to more than four feet long. He had caught
dozens over the years, but the rebels described a different
variant: a reddish one with white rings.
</P>
<P>
   If he could find one, Lynch might be discovering a new type of
amphibian. He has already found dozens.
</P>
<P>
   The 58-year-old scientist's blue eyes flash as he discusses
caecilians. Last year, he trekked into the countryside in search of
them, only to be kidnapped by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia -- the nation's other rebel group -- and held for a day and
a half before being freed.
</P>
<P>
   Flashlight in hand, Lynch planned last Friday night to hunt for
the muscular burrowing creatures. But then Javier announced that
the group was being released that evening.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists trudged back to San Miguel, where they were
turned over to local government, church and human rights officials.
</P>
<P>
   ELN commander Nicolas Rodriguez said his forces detained the
scientists for their own safety, a claim Lynch believes.
</P>
<P>
   Paramilitary forces in the area execute suspected rebel
collaborators. Government counterinsurgency troops roam the forest,
and could mistake a scientist for a rebel, Lynch said. The ELN said
it did not want to be blamed if a scientist wound up dead.
</P>
<P>
   Given his two short stretches of captivity with Colombia's two
rebel groups, Lynch has been lucky. Rebels have executed
foreigners, or held them for lengthy periods.
</P>
<P>
   But Lynch, an associate professor at the National University and
a curator at its natural history museum, says he won't let the
dangers of Colombia deter his mission to add to the 650 types of
amphibians known to exist in Colombia. On Monday, he was already
back at work.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love tramping around in the trackless cloud forest,'' he
said. ''I'm not going to stop going out. I want to help reveal to
the world that the Andes in this country is a gold mine in
amphibians.''

<HEADLINE> US Ship Was in Area of Sub Accident  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A U.S. Navy electronic surveillance ship was
operating in the Barents Sea at the time of the Russian submarine
accident Monday, Pentagon officials said, but they would not say
whether a U.S. submarine was in the area. The surveillance ship,
the USNS Loyal, was monitoring a major Russian naval exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials said the submarine Kursk, with a crew of more
than 100, apparently was in a major collision and sustained serious
damage.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have no indication that a U.S. vessel was involved in this
accident,'' Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. Craig Quigley said. He
would not say, however, whether a U.S. submarine was in the area at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. submarines normally monitor the movement of Russian
submarines. It was even more likely in this case because of the
size of the Russian naval exercise, which Pentagon officials
described as the largest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the major role submarines play in gathering foreign
intelligence, the Navy usually is reluctant to discuss details of
their movements.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley said the U.S. military had not been asked to assist in a
potential rescue of the Russian crew. It was not clear what
assistance was possible, even if requested.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Navy has a rescue vessel designed to bring the crew of
a U.S. or allied submarine to safety, even at depths far beyond
that where the disabled Russian submarine rested. But the U.S.
vessel is believed to be incompatible with Russian submarines
because of differences in the dimensions of hatch seals, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. vessel, known as a Deep Submergence Rescue Vessel, is
designed for quick deployment in the event of a submarine accident.
The rescue vessel is transportable by truck, aircraft, ship, or by
a specially configured attack submarine.
</P>
<P>
   At the accident site, the 49-foot rescue vessel dives, conducts
a sonar search, and attaches to the disabled submarines hatch. The
rescue vessel can take aboard up to 24 personnel for transfer to
safety.
</P>
<P>
   The rescue vessels were developed as a result of the USS
Thresher submarine accident in the North Atlantic in April 1963, in
which all 129 aboard were lost. At the time, submarine operating
depths greatly exceeded the capabilities of rescue vessels. The
Deep Submergence Systems Project contracted with Lockheed Missiles
and Space Co. to produce a deep-diving rescue submarine, the first
of which was launched in 1970.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 75; Nasdaq Adds 11  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose Monday, as wary investors tried to
reconcile positive economic news with fears of a second-half
earnings slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 75.46 at 11,103.26.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 7.33 at 1,479.17, and the
Nasdaq composite index was up 11.15 at 3,800.62.
</P>
<P>
   Retail stocks helped lift the Dow index. Wal-Mart Stores was up
93.75 cents at $52.50 and Home Depot shares rose $2.50 to $58.438.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications parts maker Ciena Corp., up $6.125 to
$162.25, led the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   Blue-chip stocks rose last week on encouraging inflation data,
including a Labor Department report that showed that wholesale
prices remained virtually the same in July after a huge jump in
June caused by soaring energy costs. The Dow index closed above
11,000 Friday for the first time since April 25.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have kept pressure on technology stocks, however, in
the wake of warnings from some widely held companies that earnings
could fall in the second half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Those conflicting dynamics have left investors with no clear
motivation to either buy or sell stocks. The result has been that
stocks have mostly fluctuated from day to day without breaking out
in any one direction.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market is in the midst of tentative trading. On balance,
this is a market attempting to find a footing,'' said Alan
Ackerman, chief investment strategist Fahnestock Inc. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're basically on hold until the Federal Reserve Board
meeting on Aug. 22,'' he added. ''Investors are watching and
waiting. We need to work our way through the uncertainty of what
the Fed will do.''
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 500.55 million
shares, down from Friday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 0.97 at 511.24.

<HEADLINE> Russian Church Canonizes Czar  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW KRAMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Ending a decades-long debate, the Russian Orthodox
Church on Monday canonized Russia's last czar, Nicholas II, saying
the haughty and cruel ruler died as a martyr to faith when he was
executed 82 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Archbishops Council, the church's highest body, also
canonized Nicholas' wife, Alexandra, and the couple's four
daughters and one son, all of whom were killed by a Bolshevik
firing squad.
</P>
<P>
   The decision closed a debate that began soon after they were
slain in 1918 and two years after the czar's remains were
ceremoniously buried in his former imperial capital, St.
Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   Although Nicholas was reviled by many, he and his family
deserved sainthood for their ''meekness during imprisonment and
poise and acceptance of their martyrs' death,'' according to a
church statement.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was unanimous, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas abdicated as czar on March 15, 1917, as revolutionary
fervor swept Russia. He and his family were detained and in April
1918 they were sent to the Ural Mountains city of Yekaterinburg,
where a firing squad lined them up in the basement of a palace and
killed them on July 17.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the last Russian Orthodox monarch and his family, we see
people who sincerely tried to carry out the commandments of the
Gospels in their lives,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The Archbishops' Council also voted to canonize 853 other
martyrs from the 20th century, many of them priests and monks
killed by the Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   The bishops' meeting was held in secrecy as they debated the
czar's spiritual status in a gilded chamber of Moscow's Cathedral
of Christ the Savior, a reconstruction of the cathedral that was
dynamited under Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.
</P>
<P>
   Patriarch Alexy II and about 150 leaders took part in the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Orthodox Church Abroad, which split from the
Moscow-based church in the 1920s, has already made Nicholas II a
saint, and this issue had been a major obstacle to reuniting the
two churches. During their gathering in Moscow, slated to last
several days, the bishops were also to consider the Russian
church's relations with other denominations.
</P>
<P>
   Canonizing the royal family as so-called ''passion bearers'' --
the lowest level of sainthood -- appeased supporters of Nicholas II,
especially nationalists who want a return to the monarchy, without
endorsing the way he ruled, church officials had said earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas II was the fourth Russian czar to be canonized; the
previous three ruled in the Middle Ages.
</P>
<P>
   Many believers already considered Nicholas II holy and have said
an icon depicting his image shed miraculous tears in a Moscow
church.
</P>
<P>
   Alexy II said canonization will not put to rest a dispute over
the authenticity of royal remains.
</P>
<P>
   Five sets of remains were exhumed from a shallow forest grave
outside Yekaterinburg in 1991 and genetic testing confirmed their
identity as the czar, his wife and three children. Two bodies were
never found.
</P>
<P>
   But the church did not recognize these bones as belonging to the
czar. After canonization, the remains would become holy relics.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have doubts about the authenticity of the remains, and
cannot call on believers to worship pseudo-relics,'' the ITAR-Tass
news agency quoted Alexy II as saying.

<HEADLINE> Ivory Coast Opposition Leader To Run  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- One of Ivory Coast's main opposition
leaders officially launched his candidacy for president Monday
despite questions about his eligibility for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Alassane Dramane Ouattara, leader of the Rally of the
Republicans, accepted his party's nomination for Sept. 17 elections
before a crowd of cheering thousands at the luxury Hotel Ivoire in
the country's commercial capital, Abidjan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ivorians, what I offer you for today and for tomorrow is to
build together, side by side, hand in hand, the great nation that
we all deserve,'' Ouattara said in a statement Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes at a time of mounting tension in Ivory
Coast, which until a Christmas Eve military coup was considered a
bastion of stability in volatile West Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Although the December takeover was initially popular among many
Ivorians, who had grown tired of corruption and ethnic favoritism
under ousted President Henri Konan Bedie, many have since become
disillusioned with the new military regime.
</P>
<P>
   Disgruntled soldiers have mutinied twice over bonuses and perks
they say they were promised for supporting the coup. There has been
no improvement in the economy, which has been hobbled by plummeting
prices for the country's main exports, cocoa and coffee. And many
believe the new government's policies are fueling the same ethnic
tensions that divided the country under Bedie.
</P>
<P>
   A last-minute amendment to the country's new constitution, which
is to guide the country's return to civilian rule, stipulates that
both parents of presidential candidates must be ''of Ivorian
origin'' -- a change widely believed to be aimed at excluding
Ouattara.
</P>
<P>
   Ouattara, a former prime minister and top official with the
International Monetary Fund, says he is not affected by the change
because both his parents were Ivorian. But his opponents insist
they were from Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
   Ouattara's followers have threatened unrest if their leader is
not allowed to run.
</P>
<P>
   Junta leader Gen. Robert Guei is also seeking nomination -- by
the former ruling Democratic Party of Ivory Coast, or PDCI, which
his soldiers ousted from power.
</P>
<P>
   Guei's moves to remain in power have alienated some of his
military allies, according to news reports. The reports say some
junta members are asking that Guei resign if he wants to run in the
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Bedie, who fled to France after the coup, has already been
nominated as the PDCI candidate at a conference organized by party
members in Paris. However, that move was condemned by party
officials in Ivory Coast who said the decision must be made here.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone Rebels May Face Court  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council voted unanimously
Monday to create a special court aimed at prosecuting rebel leaders
in Sierra Leone for killing and maiming tens of thousands of
helpless civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope that those people who have constantly violated all the
rules of national and international behavior, who have committed
such gross violations of human rights, will understand that the
noose continues to tighten around them,'' U.S. Ambassador Richard
Holbrooke said.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Leone's U.N. Ambassador Ibrahim Kamara called the
council's action ''a very, very bold step ... forward in bringing
sanity'' to the country.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution authorizes Secretary-General Kofi Annan to
negotiate an agreement with the Sierra Leonean government to create
an independent special court to prosecute crimes against humanity,
war crimes and other serious violations of both international
humanitarian and Sierra Leonean laws.
</P>
<P>
   Annan has 30 days to make recommendations to the council on the
type of tribunal and appeals court. The council also asked him to
suggest an alternative country for the special court if it cannot
be located in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   The council stressed that establishing a credible system of
justice and accountability for crimes committed in Sierra Leone
''would end impunity and would contribute to the process of
national reconciliation and to the restoration and maintenance of
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The court is clearly aimed at rebel leaders of the Revolutionary
United Front, who have been blamed for the brutal killings and
atrocities during Sierra Leone's nine-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution doesn't mention the rebel group but does refer to
a June 12 letter from Sierra Leone's President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah,
in which he asks the Security Council to create a court to
prosecute the rebel leadership.
</P>
<P>
   RUF leader Foday Sankoh signed a July 1999 peace agreement with
Kabbah's government but reignited the war in May, taking about 500
U.N. peacekeepers hostage. The peace accord gave Sankoh and his
rebels amnesty for crimes committed before July 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution notes, however, that amnesty did not apply to
genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and other serious
violations of international humanitarian law.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh was captured in May and would likely be one of the first
rebels brought to trial.
</P>
<P>
   In early July, the council banned the purchase of Sierra Leone
diamonds without a government certificate in a bid to strangle the
ability of the rebels to finance the war using ''blood diamonds.''
</P>
<P>
   The council is also expected to beef up the 13,000-strong U.N.
peacekeeping force in Sierra Leone after receiving a recommendation
from Annan in the next few weeks.

<HEADLINE> Israel Takes on Holocaust Debate  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN LAUB
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel's founding fathers didn't lift a finger
to help religious Jews in Eastern Europe escape the Holocaust, a
prominent ultra-Orthodox politician said Monday, triggering a
bitter debate -- the second in a week -- about assigning blame in the
Nazi genocide.
</P>
<P>
   Some said the finger-pointing shows the Holocaust is
increasingly being used to settle scores in Israel's divisive
political climate. Others said the controversy may be a result of a
belated attempt by devout Jews to explain the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the latest shouting match was Shlomo Ben-Izri,
a legislator of the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, which draws its
support from disadvantaged Jews of Middle Eastern descent.
</P>
<P>
   In a religious lecture, Ben-Izri said that during the Holocaust,
leaders of the predominantly secular Zionist movement did nothing
to try to smuggle deeply devout Jews out of Eastern Europe and
bring them to safety in pre-state Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   The Zionist movement spent its resources to meet the needs of
the 600,000-strong Jewish community in Palestine and on trying to
save secular Jews, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Zionist leaders said they preferred a cow in Ein Harod (a
communal farm) to a religious Jew from east Germany,'' Ben-Izri
said in a recording of the lecture broadcast Monday. ''The leaders
of the Zionist movement had a policy of bringing in as few
ultra-Orthodox as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, Jewish immigration to Palestine was
restricted by British authorities to 75,000 over a five-year
period, starting in 1939. The leaders of the Jewish community in
Palestine distributed the immigration permits based on the strength
of political factions, with the ultra-Orthodox Agudat Israel party
receiving 6 percent of coveted entry visas, Holocaust scholars
said.
</P>
<P>
   They scoffed at Ben-Izri's charges, saying the Zionist movement
did not have the resources to save even a small part of European
Jewry -- and that many among Israel's founding fathers lost close
family members in German-occupied Europe.
</P>
<P>
   They noted that many of Europe's leading rabbis counseled their
supporters not to immigrate to Palestine, even after it became
clear the Nazis were systematically killing Jews, and thus blocked
an important escape route.
</P>
<P>
   At the root of the rabbis' advice was their dispute with the
Zionists, whom they branded blasphemists who presumed to usurp the
Messiah's role of re-establishing Jewish sovereignty in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some rabbis managed to escape, said Holocaust researcher
Dina Porath. For example, she said, the rabbi of Belz fled
Budapest, Hungary, in February 1944, a day after telling his
worried followers they had nothing to fear, and two days before the
Nazis invaded Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   Ben-Izri said such cases were rare, and that most ultra-Orthodox
rabbis encouraged their followers to emigrate to Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said Monday's argument was only the latest case of Shas
fomenting ethnic divisions for political gain. The party has
portrayed its former leader, Arieh Deri, convicted of fraud and
bribe-taking, as a victim of an establishment conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Some suggested that with elections a possibility by early next
year, Shas is intentionally provoking angry debates and casting
itself in the role of misunderstood victim bullied by the elites.
</P>
<P>
   ''Could it be that you have started your election campaign, and
you are trying to create a scandal every week?'' one Israel TV
interviewer asked Ben-Izri.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the party's spiritual leader, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef,
said those killed in the Holocaust were the reincarnated souls of
sinners, triggering an outcry. Hundred of anguished survivors
called support groups for counseling.
</P>
<P>
   The Holocaust has frequently been used in political disputes in
Israel. Opponents of land-for-peace deals, for example, refer to
''Auschwitz borders'' Israel would have without the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   Holocaust scholar Tom Segev said the Holocaust was a taboo
subject for the ultra-Orthodox for a long time, and that the Shas
rabbis may simply have been searching for answers to troubling
theological questions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ultra-Orthodox have great difficulty explaining where God
was during the Holocaust. One of the ways to explain it is that the
Zionists were responsible,'' Segev said.

<HEADLINE> 'Memphis Mafia' Owners Threaten Suit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- Five former members of Elvis Presley's
inner circle have incorporated the name ''Memphis Mafia'' and are
prepared to sue anyone who uses it without permission.
</P>
<P>
   Presley had an entourage of pals and employees who ranged in
number from a dozen to about 30. A Las Vegas reporter dubbed the
group the Memphis Mafia in 1960 after they cruised the city in
black mohair suits and dark sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Memphis Mafia name is known by millions of fans throughout
the world, OK?'' said Marty Lacker, who owns the name along with
Lamar Fike, Red West, Sonny West, Presley cousin Billy and New York
entertainment entrepreneur George Tan. They incorporated the name
in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   George Klein, who knew Elvis back in high school, has held a
Memphis Mafia Reunion for the past nine years. A get-together
Sunday at a club featured Presley band members Scotty Moore and
D.J. Fontana.
</P>
<P>
   When told that Klein's event was billed as a Memphis Mafia
reunion, Tan said: ''If he uses it, he will get sued -- bottom
line.''

working poor, Gov. Christie Whitman signed into law a tax credit
designed to eventually give low-income families up to $3,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is especially pleasing to me because this is especially
directed at those out there working to make ends meet,'' Whitman
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Families earning less than $20,000 a year can now apply for New
Jersey's version of the Earned Income Tax Credit, similar to the
federal program of the same name.
</P>
<P>
   Families in that income bracket are exempt from paying state
income taxes and often receive refunds for the taxes withheld from
their paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill Whitman signed, the tax credit will translate
into an additional refund.
</P>
<P>
   About 280,000 families are eligible this year. The state expects
240,000 families to apply this year and receive checks for up to
$349. By 2003, a family with two or more children would get $3,000
by taking advantage of the state and federal tax programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Whitman administration will spend $45 million this year and
$69.7 million next year in state and federal money to pay for the
tax credits.
</P>
<P>
   The price tag rises to $84.1 million in 2002 and to $99.5
million in 2003, its final year.
</P>
<P>
   The tax credit boosts efforts made by the state's
welfare-to-work policies, Whitman said. It helps poor families
while maintaining ''the dignity of work,'' Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They share in that benefit, and they share that desire to stay
in the work force,'' Whitman said. ''It will reward hard work and
encourage self-sufficiency''
</P>
<P>
   Social advocates who pushed for the tax credit praised the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''The administration and the Legislature have done more than any
in memory to aid the working poor,'' said Melville D. Miller Jr.,
president of the Legal Services of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   In a report issued last month, Miller's group claimed the
state's poverty rate is 9.1 percent, based on data collected
primarily in 1997. A single-parent family of three making $13,133
would be at the poverty line, using federal guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, roughly 731,000 people in the state were considered to
be living in poverty, according to the report. That was about
50,000 more than in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is up to all of us to continue to work to aid the poor in
New Jersey,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   That work includes ''fine tuning'' this tax credit to include
single people, Miller said. Other aid organizations have pushed to
have more relief for families with more children. The program gives
the same benefit to families with two or more children.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said she is willing to work on the tax program and said
the credit for singles is a priority. So is the possibility of
raising the $20,000 income limit, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are willing to go back and work with the advocacy groups,''
Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   All of this was good news to Sandra Latson, a single mother of
three, who said the check from the state will help. She said she
would ''definitely start a savings account and not just have a
checking account.''
</P>
<P>
   The East Orange resident now works at a hotel at Newark
International Airport. October marks the first year she's been off
welfare, Latson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It just feels good to be out there with working people, going
to day care with other working mothers,'' Latson said. ''It's hard,
being that I'm a single parent, but it feels good to work.''

<HEADLINE> Ancient Artifacts Recovered at Port  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Customs officials and archaeologists have
intercepted a crate containing ancient artifacts that apparently
had been destined for the underground antiquities market abroad,
officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The artifacts date from 3000 B.C. to 1000 A.D. and include
coins, pottery, bronze items and small statues. They were looted
from archaeological digs around Israel, Yoav Sarhi, an
archaeologist with Israel's Antiquities Board, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on an anonymous tip, archaeologists alerted authorities
at Haifa port about the crate before it was loaded onto a ship
destined for the United States, Sarhi said. He would not specify
the exact date of the interception, saying only that it was a ''few
days ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials have suspects in the attempted smuggling but do not
want to release names while the case is being investigated.
</P>
<P>
   Sarhi said the plundering of historical sites is a common
occurrence in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Israel is the only country in the Middle East that allows
merchants to trade in antiquities, he said. As a result, robbers
have an ample market for their stolen goods.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists and Israeli lawmakers are working to rewrite laws
aimed at shutting down the trade.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 104; Nasdaq Adds 43  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose Monday, as cautious investors tried
to reconcile positive economic news with fears of a second-half
earnings slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 104.03 at 11,131.83.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 14.28 at 1,486.12, and
the Nasdaq composite index was up 42.73 at 3,832.20.
</P>
<P>
   Retail stocks helped lift the Dow index. Home Depot shares rose
$2.50 to $58.438, and Wal-Mart Stores was up 93.75 cents at $52.50.
</P>
<P>
   Semiconductor shares also surged after an analyst said chip
prices should rise as demand increases later in the year. Micron
Technology rose $4.063 to $79.813, and Advanced Micro Devices rose
$4.50 to $61.50.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications parts maker Ciena Corp., up $6.75 to
$162.875, helped the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   Blue-chip stocks rose last week on encouraging inflation data,
including a Labor Department report that showed that wholesale
prices remained virtually the same in July after a huge jump in
June caused by soaring energy costs. The Dow index closed above
11,000 Friday for the first time since April 25.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have kept pressure on technology stocks, however, in
the wake of warnings from some widely held companies that earnings
could fall in the second half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Those conflicting dynamics have left investors with no clear
motivation to either buy or sell stocks. The result has been that
stocks have mostly fluctuated from day to day without breaking out
in any one direction.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market is in the midst of tentative trading. On balance,
this is a market attempting to find a footing,'' said Alan
Ackerman, chief investment strategist Fahnestock Inc. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're basically on hold until the Federal Reserve Board
meeting on Aug. 22,'' he added. ''Investors are watching and
waiting. We need to work our way through the uncertainty of what
the Fed will do.''
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 605.84 million
shares, down from Friday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 3.28 at 513.55.

<HEADLINE> Britain Defends Racism Record  </HEADLINE>
By GEIR MOULSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- Britain defended its record in fighting racism
before a U.N. panel Monday but conceded that the tone of the
country's recent asylum debate could provoke racial tension.
</P>
<P>
   Britain ''remains attractive to migrants precisely because it is
seen as a tolerant and diverse society,'' British delegation leader
Sarah Marshall told the 18-member Committee on the Elimination of
Racial Discrimination. She noted that Britain received 71,160
asylum applications last year, up 55 percent from the year before.
</P>
<P>
   The increase comes among a recent focus on immigration by the
country's leading political parties.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition Conservative Party has accused the Labor Party
government of making Britain a ''soft touch'' for migrants and
called for asylum-seekers to be put in detention centers.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Party, hoping to deter asylum seekers, in March cut
cash grants previously paid to them. The government also said more
would be forced to settle outside London and announced heavy fines
for truckers caught smuggling illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   A group of 29 British rights organizations said the revised laws
create racial tensions rather than racial harmony. They claimed
Britain ''has failed to take adequate measures to protect the human
rights of ethnic minorities, leaving millions of people vulnerable
to discrimination, violence and social exclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall conceded Monday that ''the tone of some debate around
asylum has led ... to incidents of racial harassment against
settled minority communities.''
</P>
<P>
   But she said asylum-seekers will be better off under new British
policy that clears up confusion and speeds up the processing of
asylum claims. A tough stance on illegal immigration helps
integrate legal migrants, she added.
</P>
<P>
   She said British authorities and police have learned from the
1993 murder of black teen-ager Stephen Lawrence by a gang of white
youths and the failure of the police to investigate his death
adequately. The killing prompted a national debate on racism and on
police handling of such crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The worst incidents of race-hate violence in recent years were
the Brixton and Soho nail bombs last year,'' Marshall said. ''They
were perpetrated by a loner who is now confined to a secure state
hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   She was referring to white supremacist David Copeland. Copeland
was given six life sentences in June for the 1999 bombing campaign
against minorities in London that killed three people and injured
more than 100 others.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. committee is meeting to review the records of some of
the 150 nations that are party to the 1969 International Convention
on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. The
United States' race record is not among those being reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Britain submitted a 72-page report to the panel, which is
expected to issue its conclusions Aug. 25.

<HEADLINE> Woman tells police she was robbed by man wearing 'Goofy' costume  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A Bronx woman claims she was robbed early Monday
morning in her home by two men, one wearing a Goofy costume and
another man possibly dressed like the Grinch, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The 58-year-old woman, whose identity was not released, said she
was asleep in her home in the Spencer Estates neighborhood -
described by police as a quiet and nice residential area near
Pelham Bay Park - when she awoke shortly before 3 a.m. to find the
two men in her room.
</P>
<P>
   The woman described one man as wearing a full Goofy costume, and
the other dressed as a ''green, furry creature.'' Police speculate
that the woman may have been referring to the Grinch character from
the Dr. Seuss books, but were not certain. Goofy, a Disney
character, has long, floppy ears and wears a hat.
</P>
<P>
   The woman said the men pointed guns at her and stole $600 in
cash, some jewelry, a TV set and her car. The suspects remained at
large Monday. Police were not certain how the men got into the
woman's house.
</P>
<P>
   Police were investigating whether the robbery was connected to
the burglary of the woman's next door neighbor on Aug. 6, when
$25,000 in cash was taken. The owner of that home was asleep at the
time the money - in a briefcase - was taken.

<HEADLINE> Economist places interest owed to Cayugas at $1.7 billion  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM KATES
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - An economist said Monday that the Cayuga
Indian Nation should receive $1.7 billion in interest for being
deprived of its ancestral homelands for more than two centuries.
</P>
<P>
   A state attorney challenged that amount, questioning
Massachusetts Institute of Technology economics professor Peter
Temin's methods and calculations.
</P>
<P>
   Hired as an expert witness by the Cayugas, Temin began the
trial's fourth week of testimony by explaining to U.S. District
Judge Neal McCurn how he arrived at his total. Temin compounded
annual interest based on the risk-free rate of U.S. Treasury bills
from 1795 to 2000 as it applied to the monetary award decided upon
in February by a federal court jury.
</P>
<P>
   In this second phase, McCurn is hearing historical and economic
evidence to decide whether the jury's award should be increased.
</P>
<P>
   Following a monthlong trial, jurors awarded the Cayugas $36.9
million as the fair market value for 64,027 acres of land in Cayuga
and Seneca counties that was illegally acquired by New York state
in 1795 and 1807.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the award, jurors decided the land had a yearly
rental value of $17,157. Temin used that number as the principal as
he described his calculations for McCurn.
</P>
<P>
   Temin testified that applying compound interest to calculate the
owed interest was a ''virtually universal'' and ''perfectly
standard'' application. The expert economist who will testify later
for the state will contend that the Cayugas deserve no interest,
and if they receive any, it should be calculated on a simple basis,
and from no earlier than 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Temin said the interest total of $1,749,963,279 represented the
''opportunity cost'' lost by the tribe. McCurn asked if it was
reasonable to assume that the entire rental amount would have been
available to the Cayugas for investing.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the point, we don't know what they would have done or
how they would have turned out,'' Temin said.
</P>
<P>
   State Assistant Attorney General John Pickett followed McCurn's
lead as he cross-examined Temin.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the $17,157 was for rent, Pickett asked if Temin had
subtracted out normal expenses typically absorbed by landlords,
such as insurance and legal fees, or whether he factored in the
costs associated with investing, such as commissions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I considered it as a jury award, not as a rent, not as an
investment,'' Temin responded.
</P>
<P>
   Then Pickett wanted to know whether Temin assumed rent payment
was made on Jan. 1 or Dec. 31, a factor the lawyer said could add
an additional year into each of Temin's calculations if he had
chosen the earlier date.
</P>
<P>
   Temin said the jury award gave no indication when rent was due
so he applied it from the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The total would have been about 5 percent lower,'' Temin said
about using the Dec. 31 date.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Pickett switched his line of questioning as he
tried to get Temin to acknowledge that 18th century New York
officials had been fair with the Cayugas in acquiring the land.
Historical experts previously gave conflicting testimony about
whether New York cheated the Cayugas or dealt fairly with the
tribe.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than one lump sum $30,000 cash payment for the their
land, the Cayugas opted for an everlasting $1,800 annuity - or a 6
percent payment. Pickett asked Temin how many years since 1795 had
the risk-free treasury bill rate exceeded that rate.
</P>
<P>
   After a few minutes of checking his report, Temin answered:
''Nineteen.''
</P>
<P>
   ''So, in the other 183 years, can you say the Cayugas were
better off with the $1,800 annuity than the $30,000 in cash?'' said
Pickett.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't have enough background to say the Cayugas were better
off ... but if one simply takes the numbers, yes, it appears that
way,'' Temin said.

<HEADLINE> Russian Nuclear Submarine Trapped  </HEADLINE>
By JIM HEINTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- The Russian navy struggled Monday to rescue more
than 100 sailors trapped at the bottom of the Barents Sea in a
submarine crippled by a major collision. The chance of a happy
ending, the navy chief conceded, was ''not very high.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk, one of Russia's biggest nuclear submarines, was
apparently involved in a collision before it plunged hundreds of
feet to the sea floor near the Arctic Circle Sunday, naval
commander Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov said. It had been taking part
in naval exercises off the country's north coast.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials said the vessel was carrying no nuclear
weapons and its nuclear reactors had been switched off, but the
reports of serious damage raised concerns about a possible
radioactive leak.
</P>
<P>
   Russian and Western submarines sometimes play cat-and-mouse
games in the area and have scraped each other in the past,
according to reports. But the Pentagon said Monday no U.S. ship or
submarine was involved in the collision.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite all the efforts being taken, the probability of a
successful outcome from the situation with the Kursk is not very
high,'' the navy chief said.
</P>
<P>
   Ten Russian ships were in the area where the submarine went
down.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk was being examined by a bell-shaped deep-water
apparatus late Monday and a decision on how to conduct a rescue
would likely be made only Tuesday, according to Russian news
reports. A team of ship designers was rushed to the area to help
suggest ways to rescue the crew.
</P>
<P>
   The condition of the crew was unknown. The navy said at first
that it was in radio contact with the submarine, but later admitted
that there was only ''acoustic contact'' that could be the noise of
crewmen pounding on the hull.
</P>
<P>
   Navy officials declined to say how long the Kursk could remain
submerged before it ran out of air for the crew. Nuclear submarines
depend on their reactors to replenish their air supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk went down far above the Arctic Circle, but the sea was
free of icebergs, said meteorological officials in nearby Norway.
</P>
<P>
   Navy officials declined to say how far down the vessel was
trapped, but a Norwegian report said the Kursk was some 450 feet
down, a depth at which rescue would be difficult because of the
crushing water pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Navy spokesman Igor Dygalo said the Oscar-class submarine was
not carrying nuclear weapons. The Kursk is designed to carry 24
nuclear armed cruise missiles designed to knock out large surface
vessels such as aircraft carriers.
</P>
<P>
   But some Western military analysts were skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ''Normally, all submarines go to sea equipped for war. I would
be surprised if they had gone to sea without something,'' said Paul
Beaver, a British analyst.
</P>
<P>
   There was also concern about a possible radiation leak from the
vessel's two nuclear reactors.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem with the nuclear propulsion system is that if the
submarine has damaged itself while it was running aground, then
you've got a reasonable chance that there will be some sort of
radioactive leakage,'' said Lionel Trippett of the Campaign for
Nuclear Disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   Norway, which has a scientific vessel in the region, detected no
sign of a radiation leak, said Norwegian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Karsten Klepsvik.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Gundarov, a submarine specialist at Red Star, the
official daily newspaper of the Russian military, said rescuing
people from a submarine is very difficult and there is no set
procedure. The Russian navy does not have advanced submarine rescue
vessels, according to standard naval reference works.
</P>
<P>
   The crew may be able to use on-board capsules to escape, but in
the worst case would have to swim out through the torpedo tubes,
which would be very dangerous, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1983 Soviet submarine accident, the crew perished when
trying to escape from a depth of 180 feet, according to the
Norwegian environmental group Bellona, which closely monitors
Russia's northern fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk, launched in 1995, carries 107 personnel and weighs
some 14,000 tons, according to Jane's Fighting Ships, an
authoritative guide to warships.
</P>
<P>
   Russian nuclear submarines have been involved in a string of
accidents in recent decades. The navy, like the rest of the Russian
military, is desperately short of money and performs almost no
maintenance on its ships.
</P>
<P>
   In the last major accident involving one of Moscow's nuclear
submarines, the Komsomolets sank in April 1989 after catching fire
200 miles north of Norway. Forty-two of the 69 Soviet sailors
aboard died in the accident and the wrecked hull with its reactor
still lies on the sea bottom.

<HEADLINE> NATO Shuts Kosovo Smelting Complex  </HEADLINE>
By ALISON MUTLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZVECAN, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Hundreds of NATO-led peacekeepers
wearing surgical masks against toxic smoke swept into a Serb-run
metal smelting complex in Kosovo on Monday and shut it down, then
used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav officials called the closing of the communist-era
complex an ''anti-Serb'' action, but the chief of the U.N.
administration that runs Kosovo said the peacekeepers were acting
against an environmental danger.
</P>
<P>
   Scuffles broke out outside the plant's gates when outraged
residents, mostly women, threw stones at NATO peacekeepers who had
blocked the center of the town of Zvecan, 25 miles from Kosovo's
capital, Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   Peacekeepers used bullets and tear gas to disperse crowds who
tried to interfere, NATO spokeswoman Capt. Kath Hurley said.
</P>
<P>
   Three British soldiers suffered head injuries and were
transported to Pristina, while one British soldier had a hand
injury, Maj. Angus Forbes said. At least one Serb civilian received
a head wound, though it was not serious, NATO said. Serb media
reported six injuries.
</P>
<P>
   About 900 peacekeepers cordoned off a 200-square-yard area
around the huge facility before swooping into the mining complex,
which is seen by some as vital to the economic survival of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers from Britain, France, Belgium and Denmark gasped for
air in clouds of black and white smoke belching from aging
chimneys.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo's top U.N. administrator, Bernard Kouchner, said 160
people had been hospitalized in the past year because of lead
poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   He ordered the facility closed until repairs could be made that
would reduce emissions, which have been measured at 200 times the
accepted World Health Organization norms.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had to act,'' Kouchner said in a written statement. ''As a
doctor and as chief administrator of Kosovo, I would be derelict if
I let this threat to the health of children and pregnant women
continue for one more day.''
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo Serb leader Oliver Ivanovic said plant workers told him
NATO troops ''appeared out of nowhere.'' Only a few workers were on
hand when the operation began at 3:45 a.m., Ivanovic said.
</P>
<P>
   Workers resisted, wary of losing their jobs in this economically
devastated Serb-dominated region north of the Ibar River. Plant
managers and workers blocked access to the plant for three hours.
</P>
<P>
   The smelter is part of the Trepca mining complex, a collection
of about 40 mines that produce gold, silver, lead, zinc and
cadmium. The mines were not affected by the takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Recent studies made clear that Trepca would need a large
injection of foreign cash to become viable and environmentally
sound.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Serb leaders in Kosovo say the U.N.'s environmental
concerns are only a ruse to get rid of Serb managers with close
ties to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's Socialist Party said that the takeover proves the
NATO-led peacekeeping mission wants to expel Serbs and
non-Albanians from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav Information Minister Goran Matic described it as
''robbery'' and violation of a U.N. resolution that allowed the
peacekeepers to operate in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is an anti-Serb demonstration of power against unarmed
people,'' Matic told the state-run Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Trepca is an emotional symbol for the people of this southern
Serb province, who are struggling to rebuild after last year's
78-day NATO air war aimed at forcing Milosevic to end his
repression of ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   The main source of employment for Serbs in the industrial north
until last year, Trepca's mines were one of Yugoslavia's leading
export industries for years. U.N. officials say some 600 ethnic
Albanians and Serbs work at the mine.

<HEADLINE> Submarine Survival Depends on Damage  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   The chance of survival for more than 100 crew members on board a
sunken Russian nuclear submarine depends largely on how badly their
vessel is damaged and how quickly rescuers can react, naval experts
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The submarine, which plummeted to the bottom of the Barents Sea
after a collision during a naval exercise off Russia's northern
coast, sustained serious damage.
</P>
<P>
   Russian naval officials would not say how far down the vessel
was trapped, but a Norwegian report said the Kursk was resting some
450 feet below the surface.
</P>
<P>
   It is not inconceivable that the sailors could rocket out of the
vessel on their own and float safely to the surface, experts said,
noting that British submariners have escaped in 600 feet of water
during training exercises.
</P>
<P>
   ''But it hasn't been tried for real,'' British Navy spokesman
Jim Jenkin said. ''And their escape facility may be nothing like
ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkin said any predictions about the crew members' survival
would be mere speculation because so little was known initially
about the submarine's condition.
</P>
<P>
   But Paul Beaver of Jane's Information Group, an authoritative
source in the military and defense field, said he suspected bad
news would eventually ensue.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this submarine has a lot more damage than we think,
and I think there are probably already people dead from the impact
of the collision,'' he said. ''It seems to be more of a calamity
than the Russians are letting on.''
</P>
<P>
   Beaver said that if the submarine is fitted similarly to British
vessels, the crew would be able to make oxygen for themselves for
about a month, which means they probably would have enough to last
until a rescue could be mounted.
</P>
<P>
   ''It all depends how quickly they can react,'' Beaver said.
''The problem is they are not flexible and (are waiting) for others
to tell them what to do and do not take the initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkin said the ideal scenario would be to use a rescue vehicle
-- a kind of mini-sub -- to dock on the submarine and transfer people
out, without them even getting wet.
</P>
<P>
   Switching the nuclear reactor off is likely to make the vessel
hot and humid initially, but it would start to cool in a few days,
Jenkin said. In the long term, if not rescued, the crew members
could die of the cold.
</P>
<P>
   Experts were not particularly concerned about the risk of a
radioactive leak.
</P>
<P>
   For radiation to escape, a rupture would have to penetrate two
layers -- the vessel's hull and the reactor casing.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Baverstock, who heads the World Health Organization's
nuclear emergency response group, said a leak now likely would have
no immediate effects.
</P>
<P>
   If the submarine was left on the sea floor after a rescue, the
shell eventually would corrode over the next century and radiation
would leak out gradually.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the nasty stuff already would have degraded by then and
what was left would be mostly insoluble, meaning it would sink to
the bottom and slowly dissolve over time and thus become very
diluted.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a process that's not going to start for a century, and
will continue for several centuries,'' Baverstock said. ''The
consequences for health would not be catastrophic.''

<HEADLINE> Leaders Hold Summit on Congo War  </HEADLINE>
By MILDRED MULENGA
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) -- Ten African presidents gathered Monday in
Zambia for an urgent push to salvage the crumbling Congo peace
accord and to pave the way for the deployment of U.N. peacekeepers
in the war-wracked country.
</P>
<P>
   Congolese President Laurent Kabila, who angered even his close
allies by staying away from a regional economic summit last week,
was the last of the 10 to arrive. Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba is the chief mediator for the one-day talks.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting in Congo broke out in August 1998, with rebels
backed by Rwanda and Uganda accusing Kabila of corruption and of
harboring Hutu militiamen who fled Rwanda after committing genocide
there in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila and his allies -- Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia -- signed a
cease-fire agreement last year with Rwanda, Uganda and the rebels.
But fighting has intensified in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting Monday included the leaders of all the warring
parties except Angola, as well as other African leaders. Angola
sent Defense Minister Kundi Paiwama because President Eduardo dos
Santos seldom leaves the country, which is gripped by its own civil
war.
</P>
<P>
   The warring parties and Chiluba were to discuss ways to maintain
the cease-fire, to create conditions for military disengagement and
to facilitate Congo's internal political dialogue between the
rebels and the government, Salim Ahmed Salim, secretary general of
the Organization of African Unity, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am optimistic. We have been dealing with the real issues,''
he said after nearly seven hours of closed-door meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila was expected to come under pressure to accept deployment
of 5,537 U.N. observers and troops. The Security Council mandate
for the force is up for renewal at the end of this month and likely
will be suspended if Kabila continues to obstruct deployment.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila is also expected to be pressured into accepting former
Botswana President Sir Ketumile Masire as a facilitator for an
internal political dialogue between Kabila and Congolese rebels.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear what role rebel leaders would play
in the Lusaka talks. Past meetings have been split on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila, aided by Rwanda and Uganda, ousted dictator Mobutu Sese
Seko in 1997 in the vast mineral-rich central African nation then
known as Zaire.

<HEADLINE> Driver being followed by police crashes, dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAMBURG, N.Y. (AP) - A driver who was being followed by police
for allegedly driving recklessly was killed when his car collided
with a pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Sanford, 28, of Buffalo was pronounced dead at the scene
of the 12:36 p.m. crash Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The driver of the truck, Richard Klopp, 44, of Derby was treated
for minor injuries at Erie County Medical Center and released. His
passengers, three children also were treated for minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Town of Hamburg police said the incident began when the Evans
Police Department received a call about a vehicle operating
recklessly. Evans officers, with emergency lights and sirens
operating, spotted and followed the car into Hamburg in an attempt
to stop it, Hamburg police said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sanford vehicle crossed double yellow lines and into the
path of the Klopp vehicle. The collision, which occurred on a
stretch of Route 5 where the speed limit is 55 mph, forced both
vehicles off the roadway and into woods.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Monday it was unclear how fast the Sanford vehicle
was traveling when it crashed.

<HEADLINE> West Nile virus found in Rhode Island  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID RISING
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARWICK, R.I. (AP) - Environmental officials announced plans
Monday to spray insecticide in a two-mile radius where researchers
found a dead crow with West Nile virus, the first time the
potentially fatal disease was detected in Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   Four trucks will spray more than 200 miles of streets in Warwick
and Cranston, including the area where the state prison is located.
Wind and rain will delay the effort until Tuesday night the
earliest, officials said. A warning truck will drive the route
first, alerting residents to stay indoors during the spraying.
</P>
<P>
   The bird, found last Tuesday, was tested at the University of
Rhode Island virology laboratory and the results came back late
Sunday. State environmental officials said they expected to find
the disease in Rhode Island, since it already has been detected in
Connecticut and Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would have been a bizarre fluke of nature if we had been
skipped,'' said Malcolm Grant, the Department of Environmental
Management's associate director for natural resources management.
</P>
<P>
   No one in Rhode Island has been infected. Three New York City
residents contracted the illness this summer and have been
recovering.
</P>
<P>
   Like Lyme disease, carried by ticks, and the mosquito borne
eastern equine encephalitis, which was first spotted in the state
several years ago, West Nile virus appears to be here to stay. Alan
Gettman, a state scientist, said the virus has already proven it
can withstand a northern winter.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is spreading in the New England region, and certainly seems
to be establishing itself,'' Gettman said.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the summer, Rhode Island has been distributing
larvicide to communities to kill mosquitoes before they fly.
Environmental and health officials also launched an extensive
public education campaign to alert residents to the potential risk.
</P>
<P>
   The virus is commonly carried by bloodsucking mosquitoes, which
transmit the disease through bites. Infection may result in
encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain, or meningitis, an
inflammation of the brain's lining and the spinal cord.
</P>
<P>
   The spraying program that will soon be undertaken is the
response recommended by the Centers for Disease Control.
</P>
<P>
   The spraying will significantly reduce the mosquito population,
but Grant said people should still take their own precautions, like
using bug spray outside, covering baby carriages with mosquito
netting, and removing standing water - where mosquitos breed - from
their property.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we are doing will help, but what the individual does will
ensure their safety,'' Grant said.
</P>
<P>
   The state has set up a hot line, 788-3698, for people to call if
they find dead birds.
</P>
<P>
   ''People should be reporting the birds that are behaving
abnormally, staggering, not flying away when you approach them -
anything that would suggest a neurological problem,'' Grant said.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, during the first known appearance of the West Nile
virus in the Western Hemisphere, seven people died and 62 others
were infected in the New York metropolitan area, prompting the city
to undertake an aerial and ground spraying campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Most West Nile virus infections cause few or no symptoms. Only
about 1 in 300 people become seriously ill and just a small number
die.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known to affect cats or dogs, but was responsible for
the deaths of several horses in New York last year, Gettman said.
</P>
<P>
   The virus also has been found this year in New Jersey and
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   The West Nile virus is named after the West Nile region of
Uganda, where it was first isolated in 1937. West Nile virus is
most commonly found in Africa, West Asia and the Middle East.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 448; Nasdaq Adds 45  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose Monday, as cautious investors bet
positive economic news and stable interest rates will provide a
boost to second half profits.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 148.34 at 11,176.14,
according to preliminary figures.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 15.37 at 1,487.21, and
the Nasdaq composite index was up 44.97 at 3,834.44.
</P>
<P>
   Investors turned bullish on blue-chip stocks last week, and that
sentiment extended into Monday's session. The catalyst was
encouraging inflation data, including a Labor Department report
that showed that wholesale prices remained virtually the same in
July after a huge jump in June caused by soaring energy costs. The
Dow index closed above 11,000 Friday for the first time since April
25.
</P>
<P>
   If economic indicators show inflation has been kept at bay, the
Fed will be less likely to raise interest rates at their next
meeting Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, the Dow index jumped Monday after investors
turned to interest rate-sensitive retail stocks. Home Depot shares
rose $3.062 to $59, and Wal-Mart Stores was up 93.75 cents at
$52.50.
</P>
<P>
   Semiconductor shares also surged after an analyst said chip
prices should rise as demand increases later in the year. Micron
Technology rose $4.75 to $80.50, and Advanced Micro Devices rose
$5.938 to $62.938.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have kept pressure on technology stocks, however, in
the wake of warnings from some widely held companies that earnings
could fall in the second half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The conflicting dynamics of benign inflation data pitted against
profit warnings have left investors with no clear motivation to
either buy or sell stocks. The result has been that stocks have
mostly fluctuated from day to day without breaking out in any one
direction.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market is in the midst of tentative trading. On balance,
this is a market attempting to find a footing,'' said Alan
Ackerman, chief investment strategist Fahnestock Inc. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're basically on hold until the Federal Reserve Board
meeting on Aug. 22,'' he added. ''Investors are watching and
waiting. We need to work our way through the uncertainty of what
the Fed will do.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet and telecommunications parts makers led the Nasdaq.
Juniper Networks gained $10.062 to $170, and Ciena Corp. was up

<HEADLINE> New Warning Made About Asbestos  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Insulation that was produced from a W.R. Grace
&AMP; Co. mine in Montana is a danger to workers or homeowners who
handle it because of the asbestos it contains, federal health
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The Public Health Service has asked the National Institute of
Occupational Safety and Health to ''look into the current worker
exposures that may be dealing with these products and issue an
alert if need be,'' Aubrey K. Miller, an official in the health
service's Denver region, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Testing of Zonolite-brand insulation, along with Grace internal
documents, shows that ''even minimal handling by workers or
residents poses a substantial health risk,'' the health service
said in a recent memorandum to NIOSH.
</P>
<P>
   The risk to homeowners would be small if they leave the
insulation alone, said the memo's author, Hugh Sloan, an assistant
surgeon general.
</P>
<P>
   ''My sense is that homeowners themselves, if that remains
undisturbed, shouldn't have any worry,'' Sloan said.
</P>
<P>
   Recent studies show that even casual handling of the insulation
can expose workers or homeowners to 150 times the asbestos level
considered safe under federal regulations, according to the memo.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Post-Intelligencer first reported on the memo
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Both the health service and NIOSH are part of the Department of
Health and Human Services. A NIOSH official said the agency was
reviewing the health service's concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The insulation was used in millions of homes and businesses
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Grace, which is based in Columbia, Md., declined
immediate comment on the memo.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement on its Web site, however, the company said the
insulation was primarily put in older homes and seldom used in new
construction. ''We believe now, as we did during the time we sold
the product, that there is no unreasonable risk of injury or
illness associated with the presence of this insulation in homes,''
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Vermiculite from Grace's mine at Libby, Mont., was sold for use
in garden products, fireproofing, cement mixtures and more than a
dozen other consumer products. The bulk of the ore was heated until
it expanded like popcorn, then marketed as Zonolite insulation.
</P>
<P>
   Asbestos, which has been linked to lung cancer and other
diseases, is a natural contaminant of vermiculite ore.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reported last month that the Environmental
Protection Agency was investigating why officials ignored for 18
years a study that showed Grace was using ore laden with asbestos
in insulation and other building products.
</P>
<P>
   The Post-Intelligencer said it had obtained internal documents
showing that Grace officials were aware of health risks from
asbestos in insulation in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe that a decision to affix asbestos warning labels to
our products would result in substantial sales losses,'' company
executive vice president E.S. Wood wrote in a 1977 document. ''The
risk of liability to customers is heightened by the decision not to
label our products.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators are conducting medical tests in the Libby
area following reports that hundreds of vermiculite miners and
their relatives have died or are dying from asbestos-related
diseases. Several lawsuits have been filed on behalf of workers and
their families.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Begins Land Dispute Trial  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL ASTOR
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Three police officers charged with
killing 10 squatters in one of Brazil's bloodiest land conflicts
pleaded innocent Monday, telling a judge they acted in
self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   Airton Ramos de Morais, Jose Emilio da Silva Evangelista and
Daniel da Silva Furtado are each charged with three counts of
homicide in a 1995 clash that left 10 squatters and two police
officers dead near the southern Amazon town of Corumbiara some
1,800 miles northwest of Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
   In their opening testimony, each of the officers told Judge
Sandra Santos that they had traveled to the Santa Eliana ranch with
the intention of forcing out 500 squatters by cutting off their
water and waiting them out.
</P>
<P>
   But in the early hours of Aug. 9, 1995, commanding officers
ordered them to advance on the squatters and a shootout ensued.
</P>
<P>
   ''I fired, my companions fired, the special operations commandos
fired. It was a real confrontation,'' said Furtado, ''It wasn't
until it ended that I knew what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors allege some 300 police encircled the camp around 2
a.m., tossed in tear gas and stun grenades and invaded the
settlement with guns blazing.
</P>
<P>
   Autopsy reports later showed that of the 10 squatters killed,
seven were shot point blank in the face, neck, chest and back. One
victim, Ercilio Oliveira de Campos, was shot 19 times. Another, who
was not identified, was shot 12 times in the face.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the police argue they were met with gunfire as they
arrived to carry out an eviction order. Squatters had asked the
government to carve out a small plot for them, but local ranchers
insisted on expelling them.
</P>
<P>
   ''The police only reacted after the killing of two policemen in
an area where there were 190 officers against 1,200 landless,''
Marcos Soares, a lawyer for the police told reporters before the
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Closing arguments were expected later in the week and a verdict
was likely either Thursday or Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Security around the courthouse was tight with hundreds of police
outside and federal agents inside.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is the first in a series of such proceedings expected
to last through early September. Thirteen officers and two
squatters will be tried.
</P>
<P>
   The case has taken five years to get to trial due to the complex
nature of the country's justice system. Some say the politically
explosive nature of the case has also dragged the matter out.
</P>
<P>
   Unequal land distribution is at the root of rural violence in
Brazil, where 90 percent of the land belongs to 20 percent of the
people, and the poorest 40 percent own just 1 percent of the land.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade more than 1,000 people have lost their
lives in land disputes in Brazil, according to the Land Pastoral, a
Catholic group that advocates land reform.

<HEADLINE> Jury awards GE Capital $133 million in suit against DirecTV  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - A federal jury awarded GE Capital a
whopping $133 million after the company sued DirecTV to recover
losses on consumer loans for satellite dishes and converter boxes.
</P>
<P>
   DirecTV, the country's top satellite TV broadcaster, hired GE
Capital in 1995 to manage a consumer-financing program for the
purchase of DirecTV satellite dishes and boxes. DirecTV was eager
to sign up new subscribers in the highly competitive market.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies created the ''EZ Approval'' program for
equipment financing.
</P>
<P>
   Robert L. Byman, GE's lead counsel during a six-week trial, said
DirecTV agreed in their contract to reimburse GE Capital if
consumers defaulted on their loans.
</P>
<P>
   GE Capital sued DirecTV in 1997, estimating the total in bad
loans at about $150 million, Byman said. DirecTV had paid about $40
million before trial, so by the time the case got to court GE
Capital was seeking about $118 million in losses plus another $40
million in interest, he said.
</P>
<P>
   DirecTV countersued, asking for $45 million in damages, alleging
that GE Capital fraudulently induced DirecTV to enter into the
program by misrepresenting its abilities to provide accurate credit
scores for loan applicants and other services.
</P>
<P>
   The jury awarded GE Capital $133 million on July 21.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial a former DirecTV sales representative testified
for GE Capital that he was instructed to inflate the credit
qualifications of potential customers.
</P>
<P>
   ''These companies started from ground zero ... so in order to
keep investors happy, in order to keep the company afloat, you had
to show that you were building up the subscribers that would
someday make these companies profitable,'' Byman said in an
interview Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher A. Murphy, DirecTV's assistant general counsel,
could not be reached for comment Monday. He told the Connecticut
Law Tribune that the company will appeal the verdict based on
material Senior U.S. District Judge Peter Dorsey refused to let
into evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said GE's patented process for measuring credit risks was
fundamentally flawed and directly led to the losses.
</P>
<P>
   DirecTV's parent company, Hughes Electronics Corp., issued a
press release after the verdict, contending that the losses were
caused by GE Capital's failure to perform.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are very disappointed in the verdict and do not believe
that it is supported at all by the facts. We will appeal and are
confident that the verdict will be overturned,'' said Robert M.
Hall, senior vice president and general counsel of DirecTV
Enterprises Inc.
</P>
<P>
   GE Capital has filed a motion asking the judge to award an
additional $47 million in interest, based on an offer it made in
1999 to settle the case for $95 million, Byman said.

<HEADLINE> With: BC-NJ--Tax Credits  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Key points in how New Jersey's Earned Income Tax
Credit will
work:
<TEXT>
<P>
   Families earning under $20,000 can apply. About 280,000 are
estimated to be eligible. State officials expect about 240,000, or
80 percent, to apply.
</P>
<P>
   The tax credit applies to income earned after Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Residents apply for the credit by completing the worksheet
included with their 2000 New Jersey Income Tax Return.
</P>
<P>
   Those earning under $20,000 are exempt from state income taxes.
This income credit offsets any taxes owed. Whatever amount exceeds
the tax owed by the family is sent to them as a refund check. This
credit is in addition to any state tax refund.
</P>
<P>
   Checks are mailed to residents directly just as other tax refund
checks.
</P>
<P>
   In this tax year, families with two or more children with
incomes of $10,000 will see a credit of $394.
</P>
<P>
   For families with an income of $15,000, the credit is $338.
</P>
<P>
   For families with an income of $20,000, the credit is $229.
</P>
<P>
   In 2003, when the tax credit program is phased in, families
earning $10,000 will see a credit of $823.
</P>
<P>
   For families with an income of $15,000, the credit is $707.
</P>
<P>
   For families with an income of $20,000, the credit is $480.
</P>
<P>
   State officials estimate that when combined with the federal
income tax credit, families can see up to $3,000 refunded.
</P>
<P>
   The program is expected to cost $44.9 million this year and
$99.5 million by 2003.

<HEADLINE> New England ponders 'Lieberman effect' on race  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW DALY
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Vice President Al Gore grew up in
Washington and Tennessee. But with the help of Connecticut Sen.
Joseph Lieberman, Gore is counting on a region far from Nashville
or the nation's capital to help him win the White House.
</P>
<P>
   A New England sweep by Gore and Lieberman would help Democrats
offset expected Republican domination of the South and Texas, as
the two parties prepare for a presidential race that experts
predict will be extremely close.
</P>
<P>
   Geography was probably not Gore's first consideration in
selecting Lieberman, a moderate who has won praise from both sides
of the aisle for his personal integrity and public condemnation of
President Clinton's behavior in the Monica Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   But with Lieberman on board, a Democratic strategy emphasizing
the Northeast makes sense, political analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the six New England states have 35 electoral votes -
more than enough to offset the 32 votes in Texas Gov. George W.
Bush's home state and a good start toward the 270 electoral votes
needed to win.
</P>
<P>
   When New York's 33 delegates are added, the Northeast becomes
crucial for Gore, who is expected to lose much of the South and
West to Bush and running mate Dick Cheney of Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   ''Al Gore can't win this election without winning in New
England,'' said Joseph R. Paolino Jr., the former Providence mayor
and Gore's Rhode Island campaign chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Paolino and other New England Democrats celebrated Gore's choice
of running mate and said the ''Lieberman effect'' should increase
turnout throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   ''More importantly, (Lieberman) will be a great vice president
of the United States,'' said New Hampshire Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, who
herself was on Gore's ''short list'' of potential running mates.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Secretary of the State Susan Bysiewicz said
Lieberman's presence ''adds interest'' for voters in Connecticut
and elsewhere. She noted that Lieberman's wife, Hadassah, grew up
in Gardner, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Clinton win all six New England states in 1992 and
1996, five of the six went for Bush rival John McCain in the
Republican primaries this year. Analysts said Gore and Lieberman
should expect another sweep this fall.
</P>
<P>
   That sweep might have happened anyway, but having Lieberman on
the ticket solidifies the region for Gore, said Darrell West, a
Brown University political science professor.
</P>
<P>
   Of the six New England states, Gore faced the biggest challenge
in Connecticut, where Bush was born and his father and grandfather
achieved great political success, West and other analysts said.
Recent polls show Gore and Bush in a dead heat in the state.
</P>
<P>
   With Lieberman joining the Democratic ticket, ''Connecticut is
definitely going Democratic,'' West said, adding that he expects
Republicans to ''write off'' the state's eight electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see them spending a lot of personal time or
advertising money in New England,'' West said. ''It's really not an
area that's likely to be good for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's Connecticut coordinator, Jay Malcynsky, insisted that the
Nutmeg State remains ''a battleground state.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Lieberman's addition to the ticket will cause GOP
donors to step up their efforts, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Gray, a political adviser to Massachusetts Gov. Paul
Cellucci, said Republicans in the Bay State were not conceding
anything, either.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to run hard here, recognizing that it's a very
steep uphill climb,'' Gray said. Massachusetts was Clinton's
strongest state in 1996; he defeated Bob Dole by 33 percentage
points in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''The race has not changed here because Al Gore put Joe
Lieberman on the ticket, and I don't expect that it will,'' Gray
said.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Gov. John G. Rowland, Bush's top supporter in the
state, conceded that Lieberman's selection ''certainly makes it
more it difficult'' for Republicans to win Connecticut and the
region, but said that it does not guarantee a Democratic victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still believe no one votes for vice president,'' Rowland
said. ''People vote for the top of the ticket.''

<HEADLINE> Connecticut deregulation aimed to prevent problems seen in California </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI
<TEXT>
<P>
   When electric bills doubled in parts of California, the tidal
wave of outrage that swept up everyone from business owners to
surfer dudes rippled all the way to Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut energy officials are monitoring the California
situation to see what lessons can be learned from the Golden State,
where tight supplies and summertime demand has led to a huge
increase in rates for some customers.
</P>
<P>
   But Connecticut law includes many strong consumer protections
and the construction of new power plants should help Connecticut
avoid California's headaches, power industry watchers said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're turning an industry inside out and upside down with
these competitive forces, and the legislature's and DPUC's wisdom
is to shield customers from the impacts of that in the early stages
so you can allow the system to shake out,'' said Jim Sinclair,
spokesman for ISO New England, which manages the region's power
system.
</P>
<P>
   Still, consumer advocates said they would remain vigilant to any
price spikes or profiteering that may signal illegal behavior in
the newly emerging free market for power.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until you have effective competition, there have to be relief
persons to detect these types of things, and you have to have rules
that allow you to protect customers,'' said Gene Koss, assistant
consumer counsel for Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut consumers are protected from price spikes until the
end of 2003 under the deregulation law passed two years ago. The
law mandates prices that are 10 percent under the prices set in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   After these price protections expire, however, the free market
will determine what happens. And no one knows for sure what that
will be.
</P>
<P>
   The economics chestnut of supply and demand dictates that prices
will go up if supply is tight and demand increases.
</P>
<P>
   This phenomenon is in full display in the San Diego area. The
resulting chaos has driven some California lawmakers to demand an
end the state's experiment with deregulation while others have
proposed temporary help for besieged consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut lawmakers also have the option of extending price
controls or otherwise modifying the deregulation law if it appears
the market is not well developed by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike California, however, work is well underway to get more
power plants online in the next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut Siting Council has approved plans for new power
plants that would add 3,162 megawatts to the current in-state power
supply of about 6,300 megawatts. A megawatt, or one million watts,
is enough power to supply about 300 homes.
</P>
<P>
   These new plants could replace old, inefficient and polluting
power plants now in operation and still generate more power to help
ease demand crunches, said Joel Rinebold, executive director of the
siting council.
</P>
<P>
   The council would like to see even more plants come into
Connecticut, but a power plant application is not a done deal,
Rinebold said. The council has rejected plans for plants in
Southington and New Milford.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers have other protections in the new electric power
market. The law requires the Department of Public Utility Control,
the Office of Consumer Counsel and the state attorney general to
monitor power markets for anticompetitive practices.
</P>
<P>
   And public education efforts continue. Consumers are used to the
old, regulated system for electricity, where power prices remained
constant and were revised every few years.
</P>
<P>
   In the free market, where frantic deals are made on an hourly
basis, prices can go up, just as gasoline prices increase during
summer demand or fresh produce prices go up if crops are destroyed.

<HEADLINE> Binghamton man recipient of permanent artificial heart implant  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BINGHAMTON, N.Y. (AP) - A 74-year-old Binghamton man has become
the first person in the United States to have a mechanical heart
permanently implanted in his chest.
</P>
<P>
   Artificial hearts are widely used to keep people on waiting
lists for transplants alive while waiting for a new human heart.
The procedure conducted on Robert De Santis at Sacred Heart Medical
Center in Spokane, Wash. is significant because the artificial
heart is meant to be permanent.
</P>
<P>
   The operation was part of an ongoing study at the hospital to
determine whether artificial hearts are a viable way to keep people
with end-stage heart disease alive.
</P>
<P>
   Permanent heart replacement operations already are common in
some parts of Europe, but have not received approval from the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration.

<HEADLINE> Infamous Extortionist Out of Jail  </HEADLINE>
By CORMAC WALSH
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- After more than six years in jail, Germany's most
notorious extortionist was a free man Monday but that doesn't mean
he's done paying for his crimes.
</P>
<P>
   He still owes the Karstadt department store chain $2.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Arno Funke, 50, was released from a Berlin prison shortly before
midnight Sunday -- a day ahead of schedule to avoid the expected
media swarm, a Berlin Justice Ministry spokesman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of his nine-year sentence will be served as
probation.
</P>
<P>
   Funke, an electronics wizard, made a living by threatening to
set off bombs in German department stores unless they paid him
money. He bombed those that would not pay.
</P>
<P>
   The extortionist was arrested in April 1994 following a
department store bombing spree in Berlin that caused no injuries
but extensive damage to several stores.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were lucky, nobody was injured,'' said Michael Scheibe,
spokesman for the Karstadt group. ''But it could have been much
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Funke's first victim was the landmark KaDeWe store, which paid
him $230,000 in 1988 after he threatened to set off a bomb.
Authorities say he spent the entire amount, mainly on trips to
exotic locales.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, he was back and calling himself ''Dagobert,''
the German name for Donald Duck's Uncle Scrooge. He chose that
moniker, he later explained, because he always ''wanted to swim in
money, just like Uncle Dagobert.''
</P>
<P>
   He demanded $650,000 from the Karstadt department store chain,
KaDeWe's parent company. After the chain refused to pay the money
he demanded, Funke set off several bombs in Karstadt stores,
causing about $2.3 million in damage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he grew in notoriety because of his unusual methods for
trying to collect and his ability to stay one step ahead of the
embarrassed police.
</P>
<P>
   His most ingenious plan was having police fill a device with
money and attach it to an Intercity train. Funke released the
device by radio for travel back to him on a single rail as he
waited at a safe distance.
</P>
<P>
   He eluded capture at the last minute several times, once when a
detective in hot pursuit slipped on dog excrement and fell.
</P>
<P>
   He was finally arrested while making another ransom demand from
a Berlin telephone booth.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote a book in prison about his exploits and has held a job
since 1998 as a cartoonist at a publishing house under a
work-release program. He plans to get married this year to a
43-year-old social worker.
</P>
<P>
   The two told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper they want to start a
new life. But Funke said he realized that would be difficult, given
that he stills owes Karstadt for the damage he caused.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm only earning $560 a month now and will be paying for my
deeds for the rest of my life,'' he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Scheibe said the Karstadt group intends to go after every penny
Funke makes.

<HEADLINE> Priest Sought in Alleged Exorcism  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A Mexican judge has issued an arrest warrant
for a Roman Catholic priest who allegedly led a bizarre exorcism
rite that left several participants injured by being burned or
beaten, news media reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Francisco Fuentes was charged with causing injuries to
one participant in the rite, who was allegedly burned with candle
wax to break a supposed demonic possession of her body.
</P>
<P>
   Warrants were also issued Sunday for two other people suspected
of supervising or carrying out the mass exorcism, the Mexico City
newspaper Reforma said. Some witnesses have said Fuentes was only
present and did not participate, Reforma said.
</P>
<P>
   The charges, which Fuentes has denied, carry a possible prison
term of five to eight years on conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Fuentes said last week that he was only carrying out his duties
in the central Mexico city of Cholula, 65 miles east of Mexico City
in the neighboring state of Puebla.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, seven people died of apparent carbon monoxide
poisoning during an alleged exorcism ritual in the neighboring
state of Tlaxcala, after a local faith healer burned charcoal in a
small room to cure the ''possession'' of a young man.
</P>
<P>
   Two survivors were hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   In the room with the bodies, police found a small altar with
religious images, a black chicken, various powders that had not yet
been identified, magic books, three knives, medicines and an icon
of Christ.

<HEADLINE> Woman inmate accused in $10,000 murder-for-hire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FLEMINGTON, N.J. (AP) - A woman serving a 25-year term for
manslaughter could face more time.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Marie Hirko, 31, is accused of engaging a purported hit man
to kill two people, Hunterdon County Prosecutor Stephen B. Rubin
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''These were people she believes wronged her,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Hirko had paid half the $10,000 for the killings when she was
charged Friday with two counts of attempted murder and one
conspiracy count, Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   The money, however, went to an undercover State Police trooper,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities learned of the plot a half-year ago from an
informant, Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to identify the targets of Hirko, who had lived in
Lopatcong Township.
</P>
<P>
   She was served with the charges at the Edna Mahan Correctional
Facility for Women in Union Township, where she is serving her term
in the 1993 shooting death of her adopted mother, Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   The woman's name was not immediately available.

<HEADLINE> Woman's foot is severed in fall from train  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NIAGARA FALLS, N.Y. (AP) - A woman's foot was severed when she
jumped from a freight train entering the United States from Canada,
U.S. Border Patrol officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, who was not identified, was traveling with a
24-year-old Haitian, Joseph Roberto, when she jumped from the train
just inside the United States. Her foot was caught beneath the
wheels and was severed at the ankle, said Don Palacios, assistant
chief of the Border Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   An American border agent had watched the train cross the

<HEADLINE> Kohl Won't Attend Unity Day Parties  </HEADLINE>
By BURT HERMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Helmut Kohl, whose reputation as father of German
reunification has been tainted by a party financing scandal, said
Monday that he would not attend German Unity Day celebrations
because he wanted to end a controversy over his participation.
</P>
<P>
   The former chancellor had been invited as a guest to the Oct. 3
event in the eastern city of Dresden, but wasn't invited to speak.
Reunification is considered the greatest achievement of Kohl's 16
years as chancellor, which ended with his 1998 election defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The governor of Saxony state organizing the celebration -- Kurt
Biedenkopf, also a member of Kohl's Christian Democratic party --
had refused to change the program despite complaints from other
party leaders. Scheduled to speak are President Johannes Rau,
French President Jacques Chirac and Lothar de Maiziere, East
Germany's first and only democratically elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl had originally said he wouldn't make up his mind whether to
come until he returned from vacation later this month. But over the
weekend, leading conservatives threatened to boycott the event if
Kohl wasn't given his turn at the podium.
</P>
<P>
   ''With today's decision I would like to contribute so that the
day of German unity can be celebrated with appropriate dignity and
far from daily political discussions,'' Kohl said in a statement
issued by his office.
</P>
<P>
   Although speculation has been raised over whether Kohl would
attend an alternate event on the day or even celebrations abroad,
he said Monday that he would only attend an event days earlier
sponsored by a Christian Democrat-affiliated foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl's party also said Monday it was planning its own event on
Oct. 3, that would honor his service to the country.
</P>
<P>
   Since touching off a financial scandal for his party late last
year, Kohl has been increasingly isolated from the public sphere.
Gala celebrations planned for his 70th birthday in April were
called off in the wake of the scandal over cash handovers, secret
accounts and illegal bookkeeping.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors are pursuing investigations against Kohl for breach
of trust, and a parliament committee is also looking into whether
government decisions were bought during his government, a charge he
denies.

<HEADLINE> US Ship Far From Russia Collision  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- No U.S. ship or submarine was involved in the
collision that Russian officials said caused one of their
submarines to plunge to the bottom of the Barents Sea, the Pentagon
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. Navy electronic surveillance ship was operating in or
near the Barents Sea at the time of the accident, but Pentagon
officials would not say whether a U.S. submarine was in the area.
The surveillance ship, the USNS Loyal, was monitoring submarine
movements but was far from the scene of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials said the submarine Kursk, with a crew of more
than 100, apparently was in a major collision and sustained serious
damage.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have no indication that a U.S. vessel was involved in this
accident,'' Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. Craig Quigley said. He
would not say, however, whether a U.S. submarine was in the area at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart, with President Clinton at
the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, said the
administration ''made clear to the Russians that any assistance we
can offer is available.'' He said national security adviser Sandy
Berger reiterated this in a telephone conversation with Russian
officials. ''At this point there's been no request for our
assistance,'' Lockhart added.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. submarines normally monitor the movement of Russian
submarines. It was even more likely in this case because of the
size of the Russian naval exercise, which Pentagon officials
described as the largest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the major role submarines play in gathering foreign
intelligence, the Navy usually is reluctant to discuss details of
their movements.
</P>
<P>
   The Barents Sea is often patrolled by U.S. submarines. In 1993 a
U.S. submarine, the USS Grayling, collided with a Russian ballistic
missile submarine, causing slight damage to both vessels. A year
earlier, also in the Barents Sea, the USS Baton Rouge sub hit a
Russian sub, also causing minimal damage.
</P>
<P>
   Several major Russian military seaports are located on the Kola
peninsula and Russian vessels must transit the Barents Sea to reach
the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley said the U.S. military had not been asked to assist in a
potential rescue of the Russian crew. It was not clear what
assistance was possible, even if requested.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Navy has a rescue vessel designed to bring the crew of
a U.S. or allied submarine to safety, even at depths far beyond
that where the disabled Russian submarine rested. But U.S. military
officials said they were not certain whether the rescue vessel is
compatible with Russian submarines hatches.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. vessel, known as a Deep Submergence Rescue Vessel, is
designed for quick deployment in the event of a submarine accident.
The rescue vessel is transportable by truck, aircraft, ship, or by
a specially configured attack submarine. The only two such vessels
in the Navy's inventory are based in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   A retired U.S. Navy officer familiar with submarine rescue
operations said that when the Navy developed its rescue vessels in
the 1960s it told Russia and other submarine-faring nations how to
design their hatches to make them compatible with the rescue
vessel. The officer, who discussed the matter via telephone with
Pentagon reporters on condition of anonymity, said it was not known
whether the Oscar-class submarine involved in the accident has a
compatible hatch.
</P>
<P>
   Although the U.S. rescue vessels are used frequently in
training, they have never been used in an actual rescue.
</P>
<P>
   At the accident site, the 49-foot rescue vessel dives, conducts
a sonar search, and attaches to the disabled submarines hatch. The
rescue vessel can take aboard up to 24 personnel for transfer to
safety.
</P>
<P>
   The rescue vessels were developed as a result of the USS
Thresher submarine accident in the North Atlantic in April 1963, in
which all 129 aboard were lost. At the time, submarine operating
depths greatly exceeded the capabilities of rescue vessels. The
Deep Submergence Systems Project contracted with Lockheed Missiles
and Space Co. to produce a deep-diving rescue submarine, the first
of which was launched in 1970.

<HEADLINE> West Nile Virus Found in R.I.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARWICK, R.I. (AP) -- Environmental officials announced plans
Monday to spray insecticide in a two-mile radius where researchers
found a dead crow with West Nile virus, the first time the virus
was detected in Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   Four trucks will spray more than 200 miles of streets in Warwick
and Cranston starting Tuesday night at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   State environmental officials said they expected to find the
virus in Rhode Island because it already has been detected in
Connecticut and Massachusetts. It has also been found this year in
New Jersey and Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   No one in Rhode Island has been infected. Three New York City
residents contracted the illness this summer and have been
recovering.
</P>
<P>
   The virus is commonly carried by bloodsucking mosquitoes, which
transmit the virus through bites. Infection may result in
encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain, or meningitis, an
inflammation of the brain's lining and the spinal cord.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, during the first known appearance of the West Nile
virus in the Western Hemisphere, seven people died and 62 others
were infected in the New York metropolitan area.

it, but no one was hit, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Four men have been arrested in the incident - all inside the

<HEADLINE> With heavy rain, newly infected crows, Bergen County boosts bug spraying </HEADLINE>
By LINDA A. JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Health workers in Bergen County this week
will step up efforts to prevent transmission of the West Nile Virus
after eight more dead crows last week were found to be infected
with the mosquito-borne illness.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are now in peak mosquito breeding season, and the recent
heavy rains and warm weather have contributed to creating ideal
breeding habitat for mosquitoes,'' Bergen County Executive William
Pat Schuber said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Wednesday, the county health department will expand its
mosquito-control program to include ground-based spraying for adult
mosquitoes, said Thom Ammirato, Schuber's spokesman. Until now,
most of the county's spraying has been aimed at larvae to prevent
them from developing into mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   Spraying will be done between 3 a.m. and 6 a.m. to limit contact
by people and pets with the adult insecticide, then repeated about
four days later, weather permitting. Workers will be using
''Scourge,'' a synthetic version of an ingredient in the
chrysanthemum flower that is among the least toxic products
targeting adult mosquitoes. It degrades in less than four hours in
sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   ''The idea here is to hit the adult mosquitoes and kill them,''
Ammirato said, to limit human contact with the Culex mosquito,
which picks up the virus by feeding on an infected bird and then
can pass it on by biting people or other birds.
</P>
<P>
   He said workers initially will target neighborhoods in 38 Bergen
County towns within a mile of areas where infected crows have been
discovered. Most of the spraying will be done from the back of
trucks, although all-terrain vehicles and hand-held sprayers will
be used in wooded areas.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the infected birds initially were discovered in the
north central part of Bergen County, but now some have been found
in southern and western sections.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems like it's starting to spread a little bit,'' Ammirato
said.
</P>
<P>
   No New Jersey residents have been infected with the virus this
year. Blood or spinal fluid samples from 34 residents have been
tested for the virus, which is native to the Middle East and was
first identified in this country last September. Last summer, it
infected 62 people in New York State, killing seven of them.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 89 dead crows found in northern and central New
Jersey have been confirmed by testing to be infected with the West
Nile Virus, according to the state Department of Health and Senior
Services. Of those, nearly half - 37 - were found in Bergen County.
</P>
<P>
   Another 19 were found in Middlesex County, along with 10 in
Passaic County, nine each in Union and Hudson counties, three in
Essex County and two in Monmouth County. In addition, a cockatiel
found in Monmouth County after apparently escaping from its owner
died from the virus July 16.
</P>
<P>
   The health department said 608 blood samples taken from
''sentinel'' chicken flocks in each of the state's 21 counties and
525 mosquito pools collected across the state all have tested
negative for the virus, which causes a high fever and flu-like
symptoms. Generally, it is only dangerous to the elderly, young
children and people with weak immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   Still, health officials have been urging the public to try to
prevent contact with mosquitoes by eliminating any standing water
on their property, staying indoors when mosquitoes are most active
in the early morning and around dusk, and using insect repellent
and wearing long pants and long-sleeved shirts while outdoors.

<HEADLINE> Russia Attempts Submarine Rescue  </HEADLINE>
By JIM HEINTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- The Russian navy struggled Monday to rescue more
than 100 sailors trapped at the bottom of the Barents Sea in a
submarine crippled by a major collision. The chance of a happy
ending, the navy chief conceded, was ''not very high.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk, one of Russia's biggest nuclear submarines, was
apparently involved in a collision before it plunged hundreds of
feet to the sea floor near the Arctic Circle on Sunday, naval
commander Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov said. It had been taking part
in naval exercises off the country's north coast.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials said the vessel was carrying no nuclear
weapons and its nuclear reactors had been switched off, but the
reports of serious damage raised concerns about a possible
radioactive leak.
</P>
<P>
   Russian and Western submarines sometimes play cat-and-mouse
games in the area and have scraped each other in the past,
according to reports. But the Pentagon said Monday no U.S. ship or
submarine was involved in the collision.
</P>
<P>
   Ten Russian ships were in the area where the submarine went
down.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite all the efforts being taken, the probability of a
successful outcome from the situation with the Kursk is not very
high,'' the navy chief said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk was examined by a bell-shaped deep-water apparatus
late Monday and a decision on how to conduct a rescue would likely
be made Tuesday, according to Russian news reports.
</P>
<P>
   ITAR-Tass new agency said the outside inspection of the vessel
did not support Adm. Kuroyedov's version of a collision. It quoted
an expert involved in the operation as saying the submarine could
have been damaged by a blast in its bow which caused the torpedo
section to fill with water.
</P>
<P>
   A team of ship designers was rushed to the area to help suggest
ways to rescue the crew.
</P>
<P>
   The condition of the crew was unknown. The navy said at first
that it was in radio contact with the submarine, but later admitted
that there was only ''acoustic contact'' that could be the noise of
crewmen pounding on the hull.
</P>
<P>
   Navy officials declined to say how long the Kursk could remain
submerged before it ran out of air for the crew. Nuclear submarines
depend on their reactors to replenish their air supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk went down far above the Arctic Circle, but the sea was
free of icebergs, said meteorological officials in nearby Norway.
</P>
<P>
   Navy officials declined to say how far down the vessel was
trapped, but a Norwegian report said the Kursk was some 450 feet
down, a depth at which rescue would be difficult because of the
crushing water pressure. Various Russian reports said the submarine
was 330 to 510 feet down.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the administration
''made clear to the Russians that any assistance we can offer is
available.'' He said national security adviser Sandy Berger
reiterated this in a telephone conversation with Russian officials.
''At this point there's been no request for our assistance,''
Lockhart added.
</P>
<P>
   Navy spokesman Igor Dygalo said the Oscar-class submarine was
not carrying nuclear weapons. The Kursk is designed to carry 24
nuclear armed cruise missiles designed to knock out large surface
vessels such as aircraft carriers.
</P>
<P>
   But some Western military analysts were skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ''Normally, all submarines go to sea equipped for war. I would
be surprised if they had gone to sea without something,'' said Paul
Beaver, a British analyst.
</P>
<P>
   There was also concern about a possible radiation leak from the
vessel's two nuclear reactors.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem with the nuclear propulsion system is that if the
submarine has damaged itself while it was running aground, then
you've got a reasonable chance that there will be some sort of
radioactive leakage,'' said Lionel Trippett of the Campaign for
Nuclear Disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   Norway, which has a scientific vessel in the region, detected no
sign of a radiation leak, said Norwegian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Karsten Klepsvik.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Gundarov, a submarine specialist at Red Star, the
official daily newspaper of the Russian military, said rescuing
people from a submarine is very difficult and there is no set
procedure. The Russian navy does not have advanced submarine rescue
vessels, according to standard naval reference works.
</P>
<P>
   The crew may be able to use on-board capsules to escape, but in
the worst case would have to swim out through the torpedo tubes,
which would be very dangerous, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1983 Soviet submarine accident, the crew perished when
trying to escape from a depth of 180 feet, according to the
Norwegian environmental group Bellona, which closely monitors
Russia's northern fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk, launched in 1995, carries 107 personnel and weighs
some 14,000 tons, according to Jane's Fighting Ships, an
authoritative guide to warships.
</P>
<P>
   Russian nuclear submarines have been involved in a string of
accidents in recent decades. The navy, like the rest of the Russian
military, is desperately short of money and performs almost no
maintenance on its ships.
</P>
<P>
   In the last major accident involving one of Moscow's nuclear
submarines, the Komsomolets sank in April 1989 after catching fire
200 miles north of Norway. Forty-two of the 69 Soviet sailors
aboard died in the accident and the wrecked hull with its reactor
still lies on the sea bottom.

<HEADLINE> Terrorism suspect makes initial court appearance in United States  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - An Algerian accused of conspiring to support an
alleged bombing plot in the United States pleaded innocent as he
made his first appearance Monday in a U.S. court.
</P>
<P>
   Mokhtar Haouari, 31, entered the plea before U.S. District Judge
John F. Keenan. His U.S. lawyer, Daniel J. Ollen, said he had only
spoken to him for several minutes and could not yet discuss the
case.
</P>
<P>
   When he waived extradition in Canada last month, Haouari had
said through his lawyer there that he did not believe there was
evidence to convict him.
</P>
<P>
   Haouari was charged earlier this year in an indictment with
conspiring to provide and conceal material support to terrorists,
charges that upon conviction could result in a maximum prison term
of 80 years.
</P>
<P>
   Haouari is accused of joining with another Algerian, Abdel Ghani
Meskini, to help a third Algerian, Ahmed Ressam, who was arrested
in December as he crossed the border from Canada into Washington in
a car packed with bomb-making equipment.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. authorities have said Ressam was involved in plans to bomb
millennium celebrations in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Meskini was arrested in New York City soon after Ressam on
charges of providing support to terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Haouari has said he knew Ressam and Meskini but denied any
involvement in a terrorist plot.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose Monday, as cautious investors bet
positive economic news and stable interest rates will provide a
boost to second half profits.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 148.34 at 11,176.14.
</P>

   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's

</P>
<P>
   Investors turned bullish on blue-chip stocks last week, and that
sentiment extended into Monday's session. The catalyst was
encouraging inflation data, including a Labor Department report
that showed that wholesale prices remained virtually the same in
July after a huge jump in June caused by soaring energy costs. The
Dow index closed above 11,000 Friday for the first time since April
25.
</P>
<P>
   If economic indicators show inflation has been kept at bay, the
Fed will be less likely to raise interest rates at their next
meeting Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, the Dow index jumped Monday after investors
turned to interest rate-sensitive retail stocks. Home Depot shares
rose $2.375 to $58.313, and Wal-Mart Stores was up 93.75 cents at
$52.50.
</P>
<P>
   Semiconductor shares also surged after an analyst said chip
prices should rise as demand increases later in the year. Micron
Technology rose $4.75 to $80.50, and Advanced Micro Devices rose
$6.25 to $63.25.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have kept pressure on technology stocks, however, in
the wake of warnings from some widely held companies that earnings
could fall in the second half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The conflicting dynamics of benign inflation data pitted against
profit warnings have left investors with no clear motivation to
either buy or sell stocks. The result has been that the markets
have essentially fluctuated from day to day without breaking out in
any one direction.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market is in the midst of tentative trading. On balance,
this is a market attempting to find a footing,'' said Alan
Ackerman, chief investment strategist Fahnestock Inc. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're basically on hold until the Federal Reserve Board
meeting on Aug. 22,'' he added. ''Investors are watching and
waiting. We need to work our way through the uncertainty of what
the Fed will do.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet and telecommunications parts makers led the Nasdaq.
Juniper Networks gained $10.062 to $170, and Ciena Corp. was up
$7.563 to $163.688.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by nearly a 2-to-1 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 948.36 million
shares, down from Friday's pace of 993.81 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 4.22 at 514.48.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.23 percent.
Germany's DAX index was up 0.12 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up
0.55 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 0.86 percent.

<HEADLINE> There she is -- and you helped pick her  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - Miss America Pageant officials want
your help choosing the next woman to wear the crown. But hold the
phone; it's no call-in.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Miss America Instant Celebrity Judge Contest'' will put a
fan in the judges' box at the 80th annual pageant Oct. 14, for the
first time ever.
</P>
<P>
   The contest, being sponsored jointly by pageant network ABC and
USA Weekend magazine, will ask applicants to answer three trivia
questions about pageant history.
</P>
<P>
   Those who answer all three correctly will be eligible for a
random drawing by auditors Ernst &AMP; Young. Eighty of them, picked at
random, will be asked by telephone, ''If you could ask a Miss
America finalist one general question, what would it be and why?''
</P>
<P>
   Pageant executives and a panel of experts will evaluate the
answers and narrow the field to five or 10 before choosing the
winner. The person's question will be used when pageant co-host
Marie Osmond interviews the finalists on stage at Convention Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The winner also gets first-class airfare to Atlantic City, a
Trump Taj Mahal suite, a limousine ride, new formal wear and a
$1,000 shopping spree.
</P>
<P>
   ''For decades, millions of people have sat in their living rooms
on pageant night and played judge, trying to pick the next Miss
America,'' said pageant CEO Robert Renneisen Jr. ''This contest
takes that tradition a step further and lets a real person have a
hand in deciding who represents our country as Miss America.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not the first time the public's been invited to participate
in the beauty pageant. In 1995, a telephone poll was conducted to
determine whether the swimsuit competition should be held as usual.
It was. In 1996, viewers were asked to dial 900 numbers in support
of the contestant they liked best.
</P>
<P>
   Both polls were plagued with technical problems.
</P>
<P>
   This time, relatives of contestants will be banned and
background checks will weed out anyone aiming to be disruptive,
Renneisen said.
</P>
<P>
   The winner will have to sign an affidavit assuring they have no
vested interest in voting for any one contestant, Renneisen said.
</P>
<P>
   Blind or deaf people need not apply, nor does anyone under the
age of 18, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Beer-swilling frat boys take note, the contest won't accept
just anybody,'' according to a pageant news release issued Monday.
''It is designed to attract genuine Pageant devotees who possess
some level of understanding of the Miss America tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Printed, mail-in entry forms will appear in USA Weekend on Aug.
20, Aug. 27 and Sept. 3, and online entries are available at
abc.go.com.
</P>
<P>
   ''Doing it for one judge is fine,'' said Vicki Gold Levi, a 1997
pageant preliminaries judge. ''Giving an everyman or everywoman's
opinion will be something people identify with. But I think you
still need judges who are skilled in the fields of communications,
music and the arts.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Missouri Pageant executive director Mary Ann Bybee welcomed
the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really believe that whoever wins the sweepstakes, if
oriented correctly, will be able to select the type of young woman
to be Miss America that Miss America needs,'' Bybee said.

<HEADLINE> Toys R Us, hurt by Web site losses, posts 75 percent drop in profits </HEADLINE>
By LINDA A. JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Children's retailer Toys R Us Inc. on
Monday reported a 75 percent plunge in profits for its second
quarter as sales cooled and losses from its year-old World Wide Web
site cut operating earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The Paramus-based seller of games, toys, clothing and other
items for children said net earnings for the three months ending
July 29 totaled $3 million, or 1 cent per share. That beat by a
penny the break-even forecast of analysts surveyed by First
Call/Thompson Financial. A year earlier, net earnings totaled $12
million, or 5 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, net sales slid 9.5 percent, to $2 billion from $2.2
billion. The company said second-quarter revenues were hurt by the
lack of hot toys compared with last year, when Furby and Star Wars
items were all the rage. Although comparable store sales were up 3
percent for the second quarter outside this country, comparable
U.S. toy store sales dropped 2 percent for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But Toys R Us, the country's top-selling toy retailer until it
was overtaken by discounter Wal-Mart, is staying in the game,
making changes and deals to reverse its fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly, you've got a CEO who's doing a lot to try to
re-energize this company,'' said Ursula Moran, a senior retail
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in New York. ''The preliminary
signs are pretty positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Since appointing John Eyler as president and chief executive
officer in January, the company has continued remodeling stores to
improve layout and has spent $449 million to buy back 31 million
shares of its stock, nearly doubling the price. Toys R Us shares
were up 62.5 cents, or 3.6 percent, to $18 Monday on the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the company announced plans to abandon its year-old
Toysrus.com in favor of a joint Web site with giant Internet
retailer Amazon.com, a strategy meant to make Toys' online business
profitable two years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ''In one fell stroke, they eliminated a potentially very
significant competitor in the category and they gained expertise
that they don't have now,'' Moran said.
</P>
<P>
   Toysrus.com lost $20 million before taxes in the second quarter,
according to company spokesman Louis Lipschitz. Excluding that, the
second-quarter profit would have been $16 million, or 7 cents per
share, and operating earnings would have been $47 million, instead
of $27 million.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Moran said, the company is beginning some other
alliances and big programs to give it exclusive toys that will draw
customers into its stores - one of Eyler's main goals.
</P>
<P>
   Those moves include alliances with Oshkosh for exclusive baby
toys, games and plush animals, and with Home Depot to make
child-sized tools, accessories and construction kits for items such
as birdhouses, plus a partnership with the fast-growing Animal
Planet cable TV channel to develop electronic and other interactive
toys based on wildlife, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said Toys' ''most noteworthy'' improvement has been raising
its gross margin - the difference between sales and cost of goods
sold - to 32 percent from 31 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Eyler called 2000's second quarter ''a milestone period''
because of all the new plans announced, including one to open ''the
world's largest toy store ever'' in New York City's Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   He said significant expenses and charges from creating Toys'
joint site with Amazon.com will hurt results in the 2000 fiscal
year, but the business could become profitable in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will be the global leader for toys, children's and babies'
products on the Internet,'' Eyler predicted.
</P>
<P>
   For the first six months of its fiscal year, Toys R Us reported
profits jumped 650 percent, to $218 million or 97 cents per share,
compared with $29 million or 12 cents per share a year earlier.
That included a pretax gain of $315 million in the first quarter
from the initial public offering of part of the company's Japanese
subsidiary, Toys R Us-Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding that gain and the Web site loss, net earnings for the
first six months would have been $40 million, or 18 cents per
share.
</P>
<P>
   Sales for the first six months totaled $4.31 billion, down from
$4.37 billion a year ago. Moran said the dip in sales is not a
concern because since the Japanese subsidiary's IPO, several
hundred million dollars in quarterly sales are being excluded from
net revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Toys R Us now operates 1,553 stores, including 707 U.S. toy
stores, 470 international toy stores, 201 Kids R Us clothing
stores, 137 Babies R Us stores and 38 Imaginarium stores.

<HEADLINE> State college plans to issue tuition rebates  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   POMONA, N.J. (AP) - A college that reaped an unexpected $1
million windfall after sending out its tuition bills now plans to
offer rebates to students, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Richard Stockton College of New Jersey, a four-year state
liberal arts college, had planned a 9.8 percent tuition hike for
the academic year 2000-2001.
</P>
<P>
   But the college's president, Vera King Farris, successfully
lobbied lawmakers for an increase in state aid because of
increasing enrollment. The state agreed to a one-time supplemental
allocation of $1 million to make up for the disparity.
</P>
<P>
   Because the grant came after tuition bills for the fall semester
had already been paid, Stockton plans to mail red-and-green tuition
rebate coupons to all 6,300 students for use in the spring
semester, Farris said.
</P>
<P>
   The college's board of trustees will vote on the rebate plan
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Tuition, which cost $103 per credit last year and was to climb
to $112 in the fall, will instead cost $110, or 7.8 percent more
than the 1999-2000 academic year.
</P>
<P>
   The coupons, which will be good for rebates of $2 per credit,
will cut full-time students' bills by about $32 per semester.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed rebates would cost the college about $165,000,
Farris said. The rest of the $1 million allocation will go to new
faculty jobs ($500,000), technology enhancements ($235,000) and
student scholarships ($100,000), Farris said.
</P>
<P>
   She said it was important to keep tuition costs low because most
Stockton students work in jobs for 25 to 30 hours a week and an
increase would have forced them to work even more.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to keep faith. We've always had the lowest
tuition of the state schools and we would have (in 2000-2001)
anyway, but it was important to us to go even further,'' Farris
said.

<HEADLINE> Natural Gas Prices Seen Rising  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Winter heating bills for people who use
natural gas could be more than 50 percent higher this coming winter
than last, according to an Energy Department forecast.
</P>
<P>
   The department's Energy Information Administration said natural
gas prices have doubled since last year because of a falloff in
production, short supplies and high demand by industry and electric
utilities.
</P>
<P>
   And the agency in its short-term energy outlook report said that
people -- mainly in the Northeast -- using oil for heating may be in
for steep prices as well, perhaps a repeat of last winter.
</P>
<P>
   Heating oil prices spiked to more than $2 a gallon in New
England and some other parts of the Northeast last winter. The
sudden increases were blamed on higher oil costs, low stocks and
transportation problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a risk of price spikes similar to last winter in the
Northeast for heating oil as well as for diesel fuel if inventories
are not built to adequate levels by the end of the year,'' the
monthly outlook report said Monday. It said distillates -- heating
oil and diesel fuel -- remain lower than normal as refineries have
focused on pumping out gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   People heating homes with natural gas -- especially in the
Midwest, Ohio Valley and Northeast -- should brace themselves for
higher heating costs, the report warned.
</P>
<P>
   Spot wholesale prices for natural gas have doubled from a year
ago, averaging between $3.50 and $4.50 per thousand cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are projecting that natural gas price at the wellhead will
increase by about 55 percent this winter (October-March) compared
to last winter,'' said the report. Those price increases in all
likelihood will be passed on to retail customers, it added.
</P>
<P>
   A mild winter could result in prices easing, but severe weather
could cause prices to go even higher, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   It attributed the soaring prices to a shortage of supply and
growing demand as industry and electric utilities shift more and
more to cleaner burning natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   Industrial demand for natural gas has increased nearly 10
percent this year, the report said. Natural gas demand also has
been exacerbated by the hot weather this summer in parts of Texas
and California, where utilities rely heavily on gas for
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The American Gas Association reported that in the week ending
July 28 there was 1,920 billion cubic feet of natural gas in
storage, or 17 percent (386 billion cubic feet) less than at the
same time a year ago. The 386 billion cubic feet is equivalent to
about five days of total natural gas consumption in the United
States.

<HEADLINE> GE looking for 100 people  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SCHENECTADY, N.Y. (AP) - After nearly a decade of downsizing,
General Electric is looking to hire blue-collar workers for its
Schenectady Power Systems plant.
</P>
<P>
   Applicants lined up outside the local Ramada Inn beginning at
8:30 a.m. Monday, hours before application acceptance began at 1
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   By late afternoon, the state unemployment department processing
the applications had taken some 500 applicants for machinist and
assembly jobs offering between $12 and $20 hourly in addition to
full company benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials said they expected to field more than 2000
applications for the 200 available positions.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric's employment at its Schenectady birthplace has
fallen to less than 4,000 from the high of nearly 43,000 workers
during World War II. The job losses have cut property tax revenues,
hurt residential property values and fueled an exodus of people
from the city. In 1950, 96,000 people lived in Schenectady. Today,
about 65,000 remain.
</P>
<P>
   GE Power Systems is now benefiting from a rush to increase
energy capacity, especially as recently deregulated utility
companies and independent power producers bet on hotter summers and
ever-increasing customer demand, spokeswoman Jan Smith said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Schenectady operation produces key components for building
gas-fired energy plants, considered more environmentally sound than
existing fossil fuel plants.
</P>
<P>
   The company is also investing $250 million at its Schenectady
site over the next three years for improvements ranging from
grounds maintenance to e-Business.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the company exhausted its list of workers laid off
within the last five years before issuing the call for more
workers.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric stock closed at $57.125, up 56 cents.

<HEADLINE> With: BC-NJ--Flash Floods  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Christie Whitman asked the Clinton
administration Monday to declare Morris and Sussex counties
disaster areas so residents can begin to receive federal aid.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day Whitman ordered both counties under a state
of emergency, giving the State Police superintendent power to order
evacuations, reroute traffic and open shelters. Whitman's order
also allows the state to activate New Jersey National Guard units.
</P>
<P>
   Teams of state and federal emergency personnel were still
assessing the damage done by Saturday's torrential rain. A
spokesman for Whitman put the price tag at over $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Floods did more than $7.2 million in damage to public buildings
and that allows the state to request federal assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ''As governor, my main concern is to protect the health, safety
and welfare of our residents, and it's why I issued the executive
order,'' Whitman said in a statement issued Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although the rain keeps falling, we already have an emergency
situation that needs to be addressed and can't wait.''
</P>
<P>
   This formal request allows residents to start taking advantage
of federal aid programs, spokeswoman Jayne O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It puts in motion all of the federal flood relief programs,''
O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman asked federal officials to begin the process by
preparing estimates of the damage caused by the torrential
rainstorms.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman ordered all state reports on damage from the flash
floods in by Monday morning so New Jersey officials could assess
what needs to be done and where the money would come from to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're still in the process of getting those preliminary
numbers,'' Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities have precise standards for when damage
levels warrant disaster relief, Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Whitman
asked for the federal government to begin its formal assessment of
damage to property in the affected area.
</P>
<P>
   Early estimates at a Monday staff meeting put the costs at ''at
least $100 million,'' Whitman spokesman Peter McDonough said.
</P>
<P>
   But as officials met, that estimate kept changing, he said. With
each new assessment of the area more damage is found, McDonough
said.
</P>
<P>
   State money is likely not available for immediate relief since
the Whitman administration is still paying costs associated with
Tropical Storm Floyd last September, Whitman said. If aid comes, it
would have to come from the federal government, she said.
</P>
<P>
   With roads flooded, bridges washed out and dams burst, much of
the funding for immediate repairs would have to come from the
federal government, most likely the Department of Transportation,
Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   Teams from the New Jersey Department of Transportation and the
Department of Environmental Protection are still in flood-damaged
areas and will remain there, Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been there since Saturday night, and we will continue to
be there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   They are joined by FEMA workers, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's significant damage,'' said Whitman, who toured the
area by air Sunday. Homes have shifted from foundations, and
business have been washed out, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many houses in Warren and Sussex counties remained under water,
Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you see 14 inches of rain in any finite period, there is
no natural waterway that can handle that kind of increase,''
Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   State officials are hoping to have some assessment of the damage
and cost to repair available Monday, McDonough said.

<HEADLINE> New Venezuelan Congress Opens  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDRA OLSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's newly elected Congress
opened Monday, ending eight months of constitutional limbo that had
left power almost entirely in President Hugo Chavez's hands.
</P>
<P>
   But doubts about the 165-member Congress' ability to provide a
balance against the powerful presidency arose in its first session.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition legislators took the floor to condemn Chavez's
political coalition for selecting Congress's president, vice
president and second vice president behind closed doors. Chavez's
political party met with two other factions over a barbecue at the
presidential palace one week before the legislature opened to
choose the congressional leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''We see how decisions are made here. They are made over a
barbecue in the president's house. And that is unfortunate,'' said
opposition legislator Julio Borges.
</P>
<P>
   A former coup leader popular with the country's poor, Chavez has
governed unopposed since January when a pro-government constituent
assembly closed the legislature after rewriting the constitution.
Chavez says he is dismantling a corrupt political regime he blames
for plunging the oil-rich nation of 24 million deeper into poverty.
Critics say he is compromising South America's longest-standing
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The new constitution demands that legislators vote according to
conscience rather than according to party discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Although Chavez' allies hold a simple majority in Congress, they
lack the two-thirds needed to pass the 2001 budget and appoint the
Supreme Court magistrates and attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   A handpicked, 21-member provisional legislature, which included
Chavez's own brother, took over lawmaking duties until Venezuelans
elected the new Congress on July 30.

<HEADLINE> 'Hollow Man' Tops Box Office  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL WHITE
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ''Hollow Man,'' the latest retelling of the
invisible man story, kept a loose grip on the top spot at the box
office, edging Clint Eastwood's astronaut tale ''Space Cowboys.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Hollow Man,'' which stars Kevin Bacon as a scientist who goes
mad after discovering the secret of invisibility, took in $13.05
million. ''Space Cowboys,'' starring Eastwood, Tommy Jones, James
Garner and Donald Sutherland, was close behind with $13.02 million.

<HEADLINE> Schumer takes a tumble off his bike  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) - U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer wanted to fit in a
bike ride in the California sunshine and he almost paid dearly for
it.
</P>
<P>
   The New Yorker attending the Democratic National Convention took
a tumble Sunday after colliding with a car. Schumer was left with
some bruises on his shin and a bit of limp after landing on his
hip.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm fine - sore but fine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer said the lobbyist who hit him recognized him and
panicked that he had injured a U.S. senator.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was very, very worried but it was all my fault. No
lawsuit,'' Schumer said.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, an avid biker, had rented ''a nice little mountain bike
for $14 a day'' and was testing out the gears as he pulled out of a
hotel driveway. The car was pulling into the hotel and he didn't
see it until he was nearly on top of it. Schumer hit the brakes,
then hit the car.
</P>
<P>
   The accident didn't stop Schumer from taking a 20-mile ride
along Benedict Canyon. He said he intends to take another bike ride
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Schumer joked that the incident just goes to show that
New Yorkers should not venture into car-crazy Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a safe city like New York. This would not have
happened in Brooklyn,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Christie Brinkley works the Democratic convention as a delegate  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Her image has appeared on countless magazine
covers, but Christie Brinkley wants to blend in as just another
face in the crowd at the Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm thrilled to have the opportunity to hopefully sway a few
votes our way,'' said the former Sports Illustrated swimsuit model
who is one of New York's 294 delegates. ''I'll be just one of the
crowd down there waving my sign and wearing my 'smoosh Bush
button!'''
</P>
<P>
   Brinkley has helped Bill Clinton and Al Gore raise money for
years. Gore returned the favor by seeing that Brinkley was made a
delegate.
</P>
<P>
   She arrived at the state's first delegation meeting Monday
toting a video camera to capture snippets of the convention for
Good Morning America.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton was speaking to delegates, but in the
back of the ballroom all eyes were on Brinkley and admirers- many
of them men - clustered around hoping for a hello. Her blue
polka-dot shirt was already crowded with buttons.
</P>
<P>
   New York State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, leader of the
state's delegation called Brinkley's presence a tribute to the
delegation's diversity
</P>
<P>
   ''We have members of the New York State legislature and we have
members of the general public who are unheard of, just citizens who
want to be involved in the process, and we have Christie
Brinkley,'' Silver said.
</P>
<P>
   Brinkley, now 46, says she became politically active as a
teen-ager, protesting the Vietnam War and handing out George
McGovern pamphlets. When her career as a model took off, she became
a generous Democratic contributor.
</P>
<P>
   But the mother of three found a calling when she learned about
radioactive leaks at the Shoreham and Brookhaven nuclear reactors
near her home on the eastern tip of Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Horrified, she was set to pick up and move her family until
actor and fellow Long Island resident Alec Baldwin reminded her
there was really nowhere to go to escape the nuclear problem
completely. She stayed and fought.
</P>
<P>
   Brinkley is widely credited with helping persuade Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson to shut down the flux beam reactor at
Brookhaven. He made the announcement just a few weeks after meeting
with the former cover girl and other members of Standing for Truth
Against Radiation, the activist group she joined.
</P>
<P>
   Brinkley says she knows many people dismiss her as just a pretty
face but that doesn't bother her in the slightest.
</P>
<P>
   ''A model talking about a nuclear power plant is going to
capture a different audience then a nuclear scientist will,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nukes are her pet issue but she's got a healthy backup list -
guns, abortion and Kosovo among them.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, once Brinkley starts talking politics she's tough to
stop. Just bring up the recent Republican National Convention and
she's off and running, mimicking George W. Bush's Southern accent
and mocking the show the GOP made of diversity.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh, it was such pandering. It was like 'read my lip service.'
It was like 'let's bring out George W.'s cutesy Latino nephew to
show how inclusive we are,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Brinkley, who has made a career in the world of glamour and good
looks, urged voters to look past the superficial come November.
</P>
<P>
   ''The media focus for so long has been on who's the better
dancer, who's got the cuter smile, who's the most charming,'' she
said. ''My message is ... don't get won over by the pandering and
the glossy showbizzy presentation. Look at everybody's voting
record.''

<HEADLINE> Lazio goes to Planet Hollywood, criticizes Clinton for raising soft money </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - With Hillary Clinton in Hollywood raising money
from celebrities and giving a prime time speech at the Democratic
National Convention, Rep. Rick Lazio made a campaign stop Monday at
... Planet Hollywood in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   During the press conference at the financially troubled chain of
celebrity-themed eateries, the Republican Lazio pointed the finger
at Clinton for raising unregulated ''soft'' money in her campaign
against him for the U.S. Senate and for spending the weekend
prowling for donations among wealthy Democratic movie moguls.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, my opponent Mrs. Clinton, is out on the West Coast,
raising millions of dollars out in Hollywood,'' said Lazio,
standing in front of a backdrop of cardboard cutouts of actors
including Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger, who are major
investors in the eatery, as well as prominent Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those dollars are soft dollars, unregulated, large amounts of
money that will come in and undermine campaign finance reform and
finance negative ads against me,'' said Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   The event at Planet Hollywood, which filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection and closed nine of its 32 U.S. locations last
year, continued the candidates' elaborate dance around the use of
unregulated soft money.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady and the Long Island congressman have challenged
each other to forgo the use of such funds several times before -
but only if the other pledges to do so as well.
</P>
<P>
   Although each candidate says they are strong supporters of
campaign finance reform, they have not been able to reach
agreement. Clinton has raised about $1.2 million in soft money and
Lazio says he has not raised any. Third party organizations have
run television campaign commercials for both Clinton and Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, as television cameras whirred and photographers
snapped, Lazio signed a ''freedom from soft money pact'' and then,
criticized Clinton for ''posturing politically.''
</P>
<P>
   The ''pact'' calls on the campaigns to refund soft money
contributions or donate the money to charity, and calls on the
candidates to discourage third party groups from running ads on
their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said his campaign would send the pact to Clinton ''out in
Hollywood'' for her to sign. Later Monday, Clinton campaign manager
Bill de Blasio released a copy of a letter sent to the Lazio camp,
offering an agreement -- with stipulations.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are pleased to hear that Mr. Lazio is now willing to
address the issue of campaign finance reform,'' de Blasio said.
''However, recent events give us reason to insist that any
agreement reached between our campaigns come with an ironclad,
verifiable method of accountability to ensure that it is honored
over the course of this race.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he wants Lazio to ''obtain letters of compliance from
the fourteen organizations currently engaging in independent
expenditure activity against Hillary Clinton, particularly in light
of his comments about not being able to personally control what
groups like the RLC do.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Lazio hammered Clinton for spending three days
out-of-state to raise money for her campaign, a reporter pointed
out that Lazio had just returned from a five-day, 14-city
out-of-state tour that raised more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Momentarily flummoxed, Lazio responded, ''this is different''
and said that the money he raised can only be used by his Senate
campaign committee, while Clinton's funds are being raised by one
of her soft money committees.

<HEADLINE> Rastafarian Meeting Bans Marijuana  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROSEAU, Dominica (AP) -- There'll be no marijuana smoked at a
meeting of Rastafarians, organizers promised Monday, following
complaints about participants lighting up in front of Dominica's
top law enforcement official.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came after local television on Friday showed
people at the eight-day meeting's opening ceremony smoking
marijuana during an address by acting Attorney General Bernard
Wiltshire. Three police officers were also present but took no
action to stop the smokers.
</P>
<P>
   Rastafarians consider smoking marijuana a sacrament.
</P>
<P>
   Wiltshire later lodged a protest with organizers after several
viewers complained. He met with organizers Monday over what he
called ''this rather discourteous and rather embarrassing
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I would not have expected anybody who asks the chief law
officer of the country to address them to then proceed to break the
law right in front of his face,'' Wiltshire told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   One of the meeting's organizers, Rastafarian and attorney Ian
Alleyne, said, ''It was unfortunate that this incident happened and
we have given assurances to the acting attorney general that no
such activities will take place for the rest of the conference.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting began Thursday and aims to form a Caribbean
Rastafarian Organization dedicated to getting reparation for
slavery and the repatriation of slave descendants to Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Rastafarians are members of a religious sect mostly in the
Caribbean who believe in the divinity of former Ethiopian leader
Haile Selassie.
</P>
<P>
   Marijuana is illegal in Dominica as in other Caribbean
countries, though officials largely turn a blind eye to offenders
who use small amounts privately.

<HEADLINE> Women celebrated $745 million verdict with thrift shopping  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A dozen women who recently won a $745 million
verdict against a former Bosnian Serb leader for atrocities
committed by his soldiers spent their last weekend in New York
buying clothing at thrift stores, a lawyer said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''They bought shoes and t-shirts for their families. We took
them to some thrift stores. Obviously, they didn't have much
money,'' said one of their lawyers, Maria T. Vullo.
</P>
<P>
   A jury returned its verdict Thursday after watching the women
tearfully recount their ordeals. But it was unclear if the women
will ever see a cent of the money.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the women were forced from their homes and subjected to
months of torture and rape in the early 1990s as Serbian soldiers
engaged in a campaign of ethnic cleansing, according to testimony
at a civil trial in federal court in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The money is owed by former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic. Karadzic, an international fugitive, was previous
indicted by the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands,
on charges of genocide against other communities in the former
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The women were among 15 women and two survivor groups who sued
Karadzic under a 221-year-old U.S. law allowing foreign citizens to
sue foreign officials and citizens for violating the law of
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Vullo said the women had been in the United States for about
three weeks but had been too traumatized by the preparation for
their testimony to enjoy Manhattan until after the verdict. They
had, however, been taken to Little Italy for dinner one evening and
a few had visited museums.
</P>
<P>
   She said they celebrated the evening of the verdict by going to
a downtown jazz club. They spent the weekend visiting stores and
buying souvenirs and clothing for their families before leaving on
flights Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The verdict gave them some happiness,'' Vullo said. ''They
feel like they're going home with a victory.''

<HEADLINE> Ohio County Fair May Be E. coli Link  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- At least six children in northeast Ohio have
been infected by E. coli bacteria and the Medina County Fair is a
possible source of the contamination, the state health department
and Cleveland Clinic doctors said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio Department of Health said six cases of E. coli O157:H7
have been confirmed, with two in Cuyahoga County and one each
Medina, Lorain, Wayne and Lake counties.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at the Cleveland Clinic put the number of cases at seven
and said that overall 12 children have been treated in the area for
bloody diarrhea, a symptom of E. coli contamination.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to diarrhea, E. coli can cause severe abdominal
cramping and -- in the most serious cases -- kidney failure. The
bacteria kill an estimated 60 Americans each year and sicken an
estimated 73,000 more, mostly children or the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   The four children admitted to the Cleveland Clinic had attended
the fair, which ran from July 31 to Aug. 6. The exact source of the
infection has not been pinpointed.
</P>
<P>
   No one answered the phone at the fair office Monday after
business hours.
</P>
<P>
   E. coli can be spread through contaminated food or drinking
water, contact with cattle manure or through person-to-person
contact.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Backs Ethiopia-Eritrea Force  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United States backed a 4,200-strong
U.N. peacekeeping mission to monitor a cease-fire between Ethiopia
and Eritrea Monday but warned that the troops must not be a
substitute for a comprehensive peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. deputy ambassador Nancy Soderberg implored the Horn of
Africa neighbors to mark the end of their two-year border war by
starting a new relationship that would promote economic development
and ''the free flow of people, goods and ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   But her plea for compromise and an end to recriminations was
ignored by the representatives of Eritrea and Ethiopia at an open
Security Council meeting on Secretary-General Kofi Annan's proposal
to bolster the U.N. force to 4,200.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea's U.N. representative Tesfa Alem Seyoum accused Ethiopia
of continuing to occupy its territory, raping underage Eritrean
girls and women as old as 60, abducting boys, stealing livestock,
vandalizing businesses, and robbing ''priceless holy treasures''
from churches and mosques.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia's U.N. envoy Fesseha Tessema blamed Eritrea for
starting the war and and violating the June 18 cease-fire by
deporting 10,000 women and children to Ethiopia ''under inhumane
and harsh conditions'' two days later.
</P>
<P>
   While the former allies kept up their war of words, they both
supported speedy deployment of a 4,200-strong U.N. peacekeeping
force including 220 military observers backed by three infantry
battalions.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. troops would be deployed in a 15-mile buffer zone on
the Eritrean side of the 620-mile contested border while
independent experts conduct the demarcation of their border.
</P>
<P>
   The beefed-up force would bolster a U.N. mission of 100 military
observers approved by the council July 31, which is expected to
start arriving this month, Undersecretary-General for Peacekeeping
Bernard Miyet told the council.
</P>
<P>
   The two-year border war ended after Ethiopia launched a sweeping
offensive into Eritrean territory on May 12, forcing some 1 million
Eritreans to flee at a time when a regional drought was threatening
hundreds of thousands of lives. A cease-fire was declared on June
18.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10 million people currently need food assistance and
Miyet appealed to the international community for $87.3 million to
fund humanitarian aid programs.
</P>
<P>
   Annan's recommendation for a 4,200-strong force won wide support
among Security Council members.
</P>
<P>
   Soderberg said Washington is drafting a resolution to implement
Annan's proposal, an announcement welcomed by other council
diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   Many Security Council members stressed that the U.N. force must
not become a permanent fixture.
</P>
<P>
   ''Blue helmets should not be seen as some sort of substitute for
a comprehensive peace agreement. They should be seen as the
creators of the opportunity to achieve a peace based on shared
values, shared cultures, shared borders and shared aspirations,''
Soderberg said.

<HEADLINE> Red Wings, Krupp Head to Arbitrator  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Uwe Krupp and the Detroit Red Wings will meet
with an arbitrator Thursday in New York to determine if the club
owes the injured defenseman the $12.3 million left on his contract
</P>
<P>
   Krupp, who signed a guaranteed four-year, $16.4-million contract
before the 1998-99 season, injured his back shortly into his first
season with the Red Wings. Krupp hasn't played since, saying the
injury ended his career.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit suspended Krupp in August 1999 for failing to turn over
medical records of his back injuries. Krupp eventually released the
information, but remains suspended without pay because the Red
Wings found out Krupp was allegedly dogsledding while recovering
from a herniated disc.
</P>
<P>
   A decision in the case is not expected for weeks.

<HEADLINE> Pennsylvania company drilling for natural gas profits  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ELMIRA, N.Y. (AP) - Will the state's Southern Tier be the site
of the next natural gas boom?
</P>
<P>
   Several companies say they are expanding their drilling
operations in Chemung County, and at least one private couple has
struck gas on their land.
</P>
<P>
   Fairman Drilling Co. of DuBois, Pa. says it hopes to add up to
14 natural gas wells to the two it all already has.
</P>
<P>
   The company has leases for 16,000 to 20,000 acres in the
northwestern part of the county area and is looking to expand into
the towns' southern sections, said Roger Nelson, Fairman's project
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Fairman also is relying on seismic data to identify other areas
in Chemung County where successful gas wells can be drilled.
</P>
<P>
   Fairman isn't the only company probing the depths of Chemung
County in search of natural gas. Columbia Natural Resources, based
in Charleston, W.Va., operates a well in the town of Erin. Pacific
General Energies of Warren, Pa., operates another in Big Flats.
Potter McKean Resources, a smaller company based in Shinglehouse,
Pa., is operating in the town of Van Etten.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're looking for the shallower stuff at about 3,500 feet,''
said James Reynolds, a spokesman for Potter McKean. ''The deep
stuff just got hot in the last few years.''
</P>
<P>
   The two Fairman wells, at about 10,000 feet deep, are into the
''deep stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   One well is on land owned by Barney and Mary Broz in Veteran and
hit gas in March. The second, in Catlin on land owned by John
Whiteman, hit in late June.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're elated. My wife and I figure we'll be able to do things.
We have a lot of nieces and nephews and can now help them,'' said

<HEADLINE> More mosquitos, birds found with West Nile in Suffolk County  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Eight more pools of mosquitoes and eight birds
were found infected with the West Nile virus in Suffolk County, the
county health commissioner announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The pools of mosquitos were collected in Belmont Lake State Park
between July 11 and July 25. The birds were collected between July
20 and July 27. Six of the birds were found in Babylon, and one
each in Brookhaven and Smithtown.
</P>
<P>
   Suffolk County has found infected mosquitos before.
</P>
<P>
   Only one person, a man from Staten Island who is recovering, has
been reported infected so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, seven people in the metropolitan area were killed as
the virus, which is transmitted from mosquitoes to humans, made its
first known appearance in the Western Hemisphere. Various testing
and mosquito-control measures have been taken since, including
regular collections of mosquitoes in traps to see where the
infection is present.

<HEADLINE> Soft Drink Biz Blasts Caffeine Study  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A tiny study suggesting that caffeine is added to
colas not for flavor but to hook consumers prompted a giant
response Monday from the soft drink industry, which called the
results flawed and irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
   Caffeine ''is added for one reason, for flavor,'' said Jeff
Nedelman, a spokesman for the National Soft Drink Association.
</P>
<P>
   The study's authors, from Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions,
said about 70 percent of soft drinks sold nationwide contain
caffeine and likened the marketing of caffeinated colas to the
tobacco industry's early claims that the addictive stimulant
nicotine was added to cigarettes for flavor.
</P>
<P>
   In their study of 25 adult cola drinkers, participants were
given cola samples at six different settings and asked to
distinguish between the caffeinated and non-caffeinated sodas based
on taste alone. Just two said they could detect the taste of
caffeine in amounts similar to those added to colas such as Pepsi
and Coca-Cola Classic.
</P>
<P>
   The results appear in August's Archives of Family Medicine, an
American Medical Association publication.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd like to see the soft drink industry come out of denial
about the role of caffeine in their products,'' said lead
researcher Roland Griffiths. ''They're adding a mildly addictive,
mood-altering drug, one which surely accounts for the fact that
people drink far more sodas with caffeine than without.''
</P>
<P>
   Hogwash, countered the National Soft Drink Association, a trade
group representing U.S. companies that make, market and distribute
more than 95 percent of the soft drinks sold nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ''Too few people were tested, too little science was used in the
testing and too much opinion is contained in the conclusions,'' the
association said.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Leshner, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse,
which helped fund the study, agreed the study was too small to draw
sweeping conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't agree with the conclusion that caffeine should be
lumped with nicotine,'' Leshner said.

<HEADLINE> Stormy Jack Wins Good Deal Stakes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEL MAR, Calif. (AP) -- Stormy Jack overtook 11-10 favorite
Gibson County in the final yards in a battle of Bob Baffert-trained
3-year-olds to win Monday's $106,200 Real Good Deal Stakes at Del
Mar by one length.
</P>
<P>
   Ridden by Victor Espinoza, Stormy Jack covered seven furlongs in
1:21 3-5 and, as the 2-1 second-favorite, paid $6.20, $2.80 and
$2.10.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, worth $63,720, was the second straight at the
current Del Mar meeting and fourth in nine starts overall for
Stormy Jack. It raised the career earnings of the California-bred
son of Bertrando to $300,610.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson County, ridden by David Flores, crossed the finish line
eight lengths in front of Echo Eddie and returned $2.80 and $2.10.
</P>
<P>
   Echo Eddie, ridden by Iggi Puglisi, was three-quarters of a
length ahead of Royal Irish at the wire and paid $2.20 to show.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the five entries carried 121 pounds except fifth-place

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton Takes Center Stage  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Taking center stage as the first family's new
candidate, Hillary Rodham Clinton on Monday completed an odyssey
that has transformed her from a ''Goldwater girl'' of the 60s into
a darling of the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In a to-die-for opportunity for a fledgling candidate, the first
lady was to deliver a prime-time address to the Democratic National
Convention just before President Clinton offered his political
farewell to the party's faithful.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is only one choice in this election whether we're
talking about president, vice president or senator from New York
and the right choice is to keep going forward together,'' said the
U.S. Senate candidate from New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've made so much progress in the last eight years. We are a
stronger and better country than we were in 1992, but we have work
to do and we have challenges ahead,'' she told adoring delegates
from her adopted state as she tested out her speech hours before
taking the convention podium.
</P>
<P>
   The challenges include creating more jobs, improving education,
protecting the environment and providing ''quality affordable
health care to every New Yorker and every American.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats must ''stand up against any effort to turn back the
clock when it comes to gun safety measures'' and ''always protect a
woman's right to choose,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said she wanted ''to thank the American people for the
extraordinary eight years that my husband, my daughter and I have
enjoyed. It's been an experience and privilege of a lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady's starring role was in sharp contrast to the role
her Republican opponent played at the GOP convention in
Philadelphia two weeks ago. Rick Lazio, a little-known congressman
from Long Island, stopped at his party's convention for only one
day and didn't speak before the gathering.
</P>
<P>
   For the first lady, her four-day visit to Los Angeles was a
nonstop celebrity affair. She appeared on ''The Tonight Show'' with
Jay Leno on Friday and picked up $1 million for her campaign at a
star-studded Hollywood tribute to her husband on Saturday night.
Before her convention speech Monday, she had interviews with the
three major television networks.
</P>
<P>
   In one pre-convention interview, CNN's Larry King asked the
first lady how she was doing emotionally in the wake of her
husband's affair with Monica Lewinsky. As she has in the past,
Clinton refused to talk about that.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know that's my business, and I don't talk about my
personal business and I feel strongly that what goes on in a
marriage or a family should remain in that marriage and in that
family,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   During a surprise visit Monday to the Gay and Lesbian Caucus,
Clinton warned that Republicans ''have a very different vision of
America than we do.'' She said marching in New York City's gay
pride parade, with its flamboyantly attired marchers, was ''one of
the greatest thrills of my life ... I've never seen anything like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Raised in a Republican household near Chicago, her
transformation into a Democrat began when she headed off to
Wellesley College. At Yale law School, she met her future husband
and began her lifelong work as an advocate for children.
</P>
<P>
   Republican critics have long maintained that her Senate run is
really meant to be a stepping stone to one day becoming the
nation's first female president.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton denies any such ambition, her supporters are
intrigued.
</P>
<P>
   ''You are the kind of guy we'd gladly accept as our first, first
guy,'' actress Alfre Woodard told the president during the
Hollywood tribute.
</P>
<P>
   Back in New York, which Clinton has called home only since
January, independent polls show her in a tight race with Lazio, who
announced his candidacy in May after New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani withdrew due to prostate cancer and marital problems.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady's own well-publicized marital problems are
considered one reason she trails Lazio in the polls among white
women, a critical voting block in New York. She also trails among
male voters and is running below the 60 percent level among Jewish
voters that analysts believe she needs to win. She has already
asked vice presidential candidate Sen. Joseph Lieberman, the first
Jew to be chosen for a major party ticket, to campaign for her in
New York.

<HEADLINE> Bradley says he'll help Gore, sees 'private sector' ahead  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Democrat Bill Bradley promised Monday to
actively campaign for Al Gore's presidential campaign and scoffed
at any suggestion that a Gore loss would boost his own prospects
for another White House bid.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of my efforts and thoughts are directed toward November,
not beyond that. I actually think I'll be moving toward the private
sector,'' Bradley said in an interview with The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before releasing his 359 delegates to vote for Gore, and a
day before addressing the Democratic National Convention, Bradley
said he deserved some credit for a primary challenge that made Gore
sharpen his message to emphasize issues like child poverty, health
care and education.
</P>
<P>
   Though qualified in his praise for Gore's style - he said the
vice president connects with people on a personal level ''from time
to time'' - Bradley said his own supporters should have little
problem choosing between the vice president and Texas Gov. George
W. Bush, the Republican nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ''You look down the list of things that need to be done in the
country at a time when we have the means to do it, and you say
who's going to address these issues - whether it's health care or
poverty or education or working families. I don't think there's
much of a comparison,'' Bradley said. ''I think Al Gore is far and
away the better candidate for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley did not win a single state in his challenge to Gore. But
under Democratic Party rules, candidates winning at least 15
percent of the vote in any state receive delegates proportionate to
their showing.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley won about 420 delegates in all, but some were unpledged
''superdelegates'' who switched their support to Gore after Bradley
dropped out in March.
</P>
<P>
   By Bradley's count, he still had 359 delegates pledged to him.
On Monday, he asked them ''to make a commitment to Al Gore and to
the Democratic Party so we can win in November.''
</P>
<P>
   Twice in the AP interview Bradley was asked about his comments
during campaign that Gore did not tell the truth as a candidate and
thus might not be trustworthy as president.
</P>
<P>
   Twice he answered, ''I'm not going to rehash the primary.''
</P>
<P>
   The former three-term senator from New Jersey is keeping a
limited public schedule during the convention. He is to address
breakfast meetings of only two state delegations - New Jersey and
North Carolina. His prime-time address is Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has lost the 15 pounds he gained on the campaign
trail, plus five more.
</P>
<P>
   ''In terms of my own life,'' Bradley said, ''I'm following the
advice that Tom Dewey gave Richard Nixon in 1960 when he wrote him
a letter saying, 'If you lose the presidential race don't make any
life decisions for six months.' I think it's very good advice.''
</P>
<P>
   He has spent part of the past five months writing a book based
on the speeches and ideas that were central to his campaign. The
book, ''The Journey From Here,'' will reach bookstores in
September.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wrote it,'' he said, ''to answer the question somebody might
have, 'So what was that Bradley campaign about in 2000?'''
</P>
<P>
   He will spend some time on a book tour this fall but denied that
will be a diversion from his efforts to help Gore and Democratic
congressional candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to be actively out campaigning for the ticket and
for Democrats around the country,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   He said his background makes him strong in battleground states
like Missouri, where he grew up, and New Jersey, where he served in
the Senate, as well as Pennsylvania and Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think all those are areas where I could be helpful, and I'm
willing to,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Pedro Martinez left after four innings on Monday
night with right shoulder stiffness -- his shortest outing since he
was injured in the 1999 playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox ace struck out the side in the first inning and
fanned two more in the second against Tampa Bay. But in the third,
he allowed Miguel Cairo's first homer in more than a year -- a
three-run shot that gave the Devil Rays a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez allowed six hits in all, walking none and striking out
six. Hipolito Pichardo came on to start the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez lasted four innings in Game 1 of Boston's the
first-round playoff series against Cleveland before leaving with
shoulder stiffness, but he returned to throw six no-hit innings of
relief in Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   He lasted just 3 2-3 innings on July 18, 1999, against he
Florida Marlins, allowing nine runs -- seven earned -- and 12 hits.
He went on the disabled list after the game.
</P>
<P>
   It was his first outing after the All-Star game, when he struck
out five of six batters and was voted MVP.

<HEADLINE> Union Leaders: Nader Can Hurt Gore  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Two major union leaders sent a pointed
message Monday to third party candidate Ralph Nader: You can only
hurt Al Gore and labor causes.
</P>
<P>
   Teamsters President James Hoffa said his union had ruled out
endorsing Nader despite the Green Party candidate's decision to
join the union in opposing permanent normal trade status for China.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we have to look at reality as to who has a chance of
winning,'' Hoffa said in an interview with The Associated Press.
''And while I have great respect for him, I think it's going to be
hard for him to pull enough votes to win.''
</P>
<P>
   AFL-CIO President John Sweeney agreed, saying Nader will only
siphon votes away from Gore, whom most major unions are backing.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line is one of two major candidates will be elected
president,'' he said. ''We are going to be out there working with
the rank-and-file members who are leaning in some cases toward
Nader to educate them on the issues and to remind them of what the
reality of the situation is.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader fired back, accusing the union leaders of taking the
position that as long as Republicans are considered worse, they
will support the Democrats no matter what their positions.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has to be a new start and if we cannot receive the labor
leaders' support, we will continue to defend and receive the
support of the rank and file,'' Nader said.
</P>
<P>
   But in a separate AP interview, Sweeney said Gore's record on
labor issues, outside of his position on free trade, was very
strong.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basically, Al Gore's record and his position on major issues
is as close as you can get to our position,'' Sweeney said.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO noted that both Gore and his running mate,
Connecticut Sen. Joseph Lieberman, supported the labor federation's
positions more than 80 percent of the time, while Republican
vice-presidential nominee Dick Cheney had a 6 percent favorable
voting record while serving in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney said that union leaders would tell their members about
Gore's pro-labor record and about Nader's inability to win. In
addition, he said Nader until recently could not be found on a
picket line or lending his support to a union's effort to negotiate
a new contract.
</P>
<P>
   While the Teamsters have yet to endorse a presidential
candidate, Hoffa said the Democrats can't win without the support
of organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   ''They should be very careful to tailor their message to make
sure they get the support of working families and union families,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Nader said that every vote he receives would enhance
organized labor's clout in the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whatever millions of votes I get will send a message to the
Democrats that they cannot continue to take labor and labor unions
for granted,'' Nader said. ''It's difficult to discern how many
more betrayals and lies by the Democratic Party it will take before
organized labor decides to help build a new progressive, pro-worker
political movement.''

<HEADLINE> New Zealander May Steer U.S. Boat  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD ULMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   A New Zealander may steer the next American boat to win the
America's Cup, a source of patriotic pride during 132 years of U.S.
domination. Now it's a prize sought by billionaires wooing sailors
more concerned with cash than citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Dickson, who drove New Zealand's first America's Cup entry
in 1987 to a 37-1 record before losing in the semifinals, is a top
prospect for skipper of the team being assembled by Larry Ellison,
chief executive officer of software giant Oracle, for the 2002-2003
Cup competition.
</P>
<P>
   ''He certainly is a likely candidate,'' Bill Erkelens, chief
operating officer of Oracle Racing Inc., said Monday. Dickson, part
of Ellison's maxiboat team for several years, would be sailing for
his third country in four America's Cup campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   No skipper has won the Cup for a country other than his own.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand replaced the United States as the America's Cup
power when it won in 1995 off San Diego against an American boat
skippered by Paul Cayard. It successfully defended it this year
against Prada of Italy, which eliminated Cayard's AmericaOne in the
semifinals off Auckland, where the next competition will be held.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Cayard announced he sold two boats and other
AmericaOne assets to Ellison, citing the growing cost of putting
together a strong team. With four billionaires expected to compete,
Cayard said the $30 million he could reasonably raise was less than
half what his opponents, including Ellison, could come up with.
</P>
<P>
   One billionaire, Ernesto Bertarelli of Switzerland, lured away
Russell Coutts and Brad Butterworth, the skipper and tactician for
New Zealand's two winning efforts. Two other Team New Zealand crew
members are with Oracle.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dickson has a long relationship with Larry as a skipper, so
he's the incumbent skipper,'' said Cayard, Oracle's campaign
manager.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll be a part of the sailing team,'' Cayard added during a
conference call with Erkelens. ''I don't think any of that is
sorted out yet as to what my role will be.''
</P>
<P>
   It probably won't be skipper. Dickson was skipper of Ellison's
boat, Sayonara, which won the Sydney-to-Hobart race in 1998 in
which six sailors died in winds up to 90 mph and swells reaching 35
feet.
</P>
<P>
   ''When (Ellison) found out some of these (Sayonara crew members)
were considering moving along, he decided that it might be time to
jump into the game,'' Erkelens said of Ellison's Cup interest.
''Larry would like to be involved as much as his schedule allows''
but it appeared unlikely he would be a regular crew member.
</P>
<P>
   Dickson was 24 during the 1986-87 Cup competition and one of New
Zealand's bright hopes. But in 1992, he was the skipper of Japan's
first Cup campaign and, in 1995, he drove Tag Heuer, one of two
Kiwi boats in the competition. The other one, raced by Team New
Zealand, won the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The United States won all 25 Cups from 1851 through 1980.
Australia II beat Dennis Conner's Liberty in 1983, but Conner
regained the Cup in Fremantle, Australia, four years later. He
successfully defended it in 1988, and the United States kept it in
1992 when America3 beat Il Moro di Venezia of Italy, skippered by
Cayard.
</P>
<P>
   Cayard said Ellison's effort would represent the St. Francis
Yacht Club in San Francisco, just as AmericaOne did.
</P>
<P>
   Erkelens said Oracle would begin sailing one of the AmericaOne
boats off Auckland in October.

<HEADLINE> Reds' Griffey: 'I'm on Trial'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Slumping for much of the season, Ken Griffey
Jr. is feels burdened during his first year with the Cincinnati
Reds, complaining about his treatment from fans and reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's kind of tough when you've got the media on you and you
come to the ballpark and you have fans yelling things that are off
the wall,'' the center fielder told foxsports.com in an interview
posted Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the things that I had to deal with the first couple of
months of the season ... I felt like calling Johnny Cochran and
saying, 'Hey, come defend me, I'm on trial,' and that's how I felt.
I felt like I was on trial. Everything I did was brought up.''
</P>
<P>
   Going into Monday night's game at Milwaukee, Griffey was hitting
.249 with 34 homers and 100 RBIs. At this rate, he would finish
with the lowest batting average of his major league career, and he
would have his lowest home-run and RBIs totals since his
injury-shortened 1995 season.
</P>
<P>
   He said criticism of his season has gotten to him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody's human, you're not some piece of meat,'' he said.
''Everybody has some type of feelings. Some people can block it out
and some can't.''
</P>
<P>
   He isn't surprised that the Mariners lead the AL West and feels
its unfair to say his absence is the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're a better team because they added $30 million in
payroll that they didn't have last year,'' he said. ''If you do
that, you're going to win. You're going to have a better team. The
fans don't see that. All they see is they're winning and Griffey's
not there.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey detailed his version of what led the Mariners to trade
him to the Reds, who signed him to a $116.5 million, nine-year
contract that included $57.5 million in deferred salary -- far less
than he would have commanded as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   And he isn't happy with the way he's been treated in Seattle
since the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I took some shots in Seattle, still am. I call them the
parting shots,'' he said. ''They don't say the stuff until you're
gone. That's not being a man. If you're going to say something, at
least let the guy defend himself. It's not his reputation that's on
the line, it's mine.''

<HEADLINE> Titanic Treasures Are Eroding Fast  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID PITT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Time is quickly running out to get inside the
Titanic because its hull is deteriorating more rapidly than
expected, said the president of the Atlanta-based company
conducting salvage operations at the ship.
</P>
<P>
   The only items recovered from the ocean liner that sank on its
maiden voyage on April 14, 1912, are scattered in a debris field
around the ship's hull.
</P>
<P>
   This summer's work in the area 350 miles south of Newfoundland
has led to the recovery of about 500 artifacts, including a
third-class passenger's purse with its contents intact, said Arnie
Geller, president of the RMS Titanic Inc. Geller's company is the
only one authorized to salvage items from the shipwreck.
</P>
<P>
   But treasures and historic artifacts still inside the ship's
hull may never be salvaged unless crews make progress within the
next season or two.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have estimated that iron-eating microbes already have
consumed as much as 20 percent of the bow.
</P>
<P>
   According to Geller, scientists anticipated two years ago that
rapid deterioration would occur over the next five years. Divers
looking at the shipwreck in recent weeks say the ship could last
two more years -- or could collapse like an accordion within months.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was dramatically different between two years ago and today.
We were all very surprised,'' Geller said.
</P>
<P>
   David Concannon, a Philadelphia attorney who represents RMS
Titanic, has recently spent 16 hours in a submersible, helping
recovery operations with Titanic expedition veterans. They also
were shocked when they saw the extent of deterioration.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's devastating to look at. The wreck is not what you imagine
when you see it on film or in books,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Geller hopes to place robotic cameras inside the hull before the
scheduled Aug. 30 conclusion of this season's expedition to record
rooms that have not been seen before, in case the ship collapses.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond August, the weather is too severe for further work.
</P>
<P>
   In early August, U.S. District Judge J. Calvitt Clarke Jr.
issued an order keeping the company from cutting into the Titanic's
hull and banning the sale of items taken from the shipwreck.
</P>
<P>
   The orders came after RMS Titanic Inc. officials said they were
searching for $300 million in lost diamonds and suggested they
might sell ''non-historical'' items from the wreckage. The company
has already sold chunks of coal and some coins as collateral for
loans.
</P>
<P>
   The court has ruled that Titanic artifacts can be sold only as a
single collection for public display. RMS Titanic has raised money
for salvage operations with traveling exhibitions of Titanic
artifacts.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Hollings: I'll Run in 2004  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- South Carolina Sen. Ernest ''Fritz''
Hollings, the nation's most senior junior senator, told fellow
convention delegates Monday he will seek re-election in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got 4&AMP;frac12; years to go on this term, but reporters still want
to know, 'Am I running?' Yes, I'm running,'' Hollings told cheering
South Carolina delegates during a breakfast meeting at the
Democratic National Convention. After his re-election in November
1998, Hollings had hinted his current term might be his last.
</P>
<P>
   The 78-year-old Hollings is 19 years younger than South
Carolina's senior senator, Republican Strom Thurmond.
</P>
<P>
   Hollings has served 32 years in the Senate and will be 83 in
January 2005, when his next term would start. Thurmond has said he
will step down at the end of his eighth term in January 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll finally be able to call him the senior senator,'' said
state Democratic Party Chairman Dick Harpootlian.

<HEADLINE> Kristin Gore Moves Into Spotlight  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Al Gore's daughter Karenna likes to say how
many doors she's knocked on urging people to vote for her dad.
Yeah, it means ''lots of restraining orders'' chimes in sister
Kristin.
</P>
<P>
   Bada-boom. Kristin Gore's a comedy writer who still hasn't quite
gotten used to the spotlight cast by her would-be president dad.
But there's nothing like jumping in with both feet: She and
big-sister Karenna hammed it up with Jay Leno on ''The Tonight
Show'' Monday.
</P>
<P>
   No, their dad's not stiff, the sisters insisted -- they don't
know what perpetuates that image.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Kristin writes jokes for her dad, ''about him,
sometimes,'' she confessed to Leno. ''I try to keep him in a good
mood generally.''
</P>
<P>
   The 20-something crowd obviously thinks this Gore daughter is
funny -- the Fox TV show she has written for since May, Futurama, is
considered the epitome of hip.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't get much chance to showcase that humor with Leno,
though -- another comedian, Jon Stewart, stole the show with
wisecracks. But the sisters revealed a pretty human side of their
dad: When they were kids and wanted to swim, he'd sneak them in to
a congressional pool through the all-male gym. Yes, sometimes it
meant running into tubby senators wrapped in towels.
</P>
<P>
   ''They burst in on Ted Kennedy and he goes 'ah good you're
here,''' Stewart interjects as Schiff covered her face to smother
the grin.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Monday's late-night TV gave major exposure to a Gore
daughter who's kind of shy, preferring to help her dad's campaign
behind the scenes. It also was a warmup for Thursday, when millions
will watch Kristin Gore on prime-time as she introduces mom Tipper.
</P>
<P>
   Is all the attention overwhelming?
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh no, not at all,'' the 23-year-old deadpanned, surrounded by
about 50 reporters and TV cameras.
</P>
<P>
   But amid the fun with stars like Leno, Kristin and her sister
are working the town with serious reasons to vote for their dad.
Until Al Gore and wife Tipper arrive Wednesday, the sisters are the
would-be president's chief ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
   Schiff took to the convention podium Monday to unveil a new
interactive Internet site -- http://www.algore.com -- that lets Web
surfers e-mail questions to Gore and running mate Joe Lieberman,
register to vote online, or volunteer to help the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In a live online chat with Democrats, Schiff called the Internet
important in rallying voters to Gore, and called this election
vital.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the next president will reshape the Supreme Court,
appointing several new justices. The selections are crucial for
such issues as women's choice in abortion, curbing gun violence and
safeguarding HMO patients, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That will impact people's lives,'' said Schiff, calling
differences between the two political parties ''crystal clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Schiff, 27, is an old pro at this kind of campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   But Kristin Gore, a writer not an orator, is still feeling her
way.
</P>
<P>
   Stopping at a party for delegates from Oregon, Alaska and
Washington, Kristin declined an offer to address the crowd but
shook hands from the back of the room.
</P>
<P>
   Next stop was to see more than 500 young Democrats gathered for
a Goo Goo Dolls concert. Her message: ''We are the party of
workers' rights, and the party of the minimum wage.''
</P>
<P>
   One-on-one, however, Kristin Gore charms.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's a delightful young woman,'' said Judith Mehrens of
Clackamus, Ore., who spoke with her at the delegation party. ''She
is very warm, very real. She told me, 'Thanks for being here.
Thanks for helping my dad.'''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Nuke Lab Scientist Is Accused  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD BENKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- A scientist charged with mishandling
restricted data at Los Alamos National Laboratory was accused
Monday of repeatedly trying to enter secure lab areas after his
access privileges were revoked.
</P>
<P>
   One of those attempts occurred at 3:31 a.m. on Christmas Eve
1998, prosecutors said Monday in listing all additional allegations
they expect to try to offer at Wen Ho Lee's November trial.
</P>
<P>
   They also said Lee once admitted he may have given classified
information to a Chinese scientist in the 1980s. The defense said
there is no evidence Lee ever passed anything to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution's filing contends Lee tried 16 times to re-enter
a secure lab area after his access privileges were terminated Dec.
23, 1998, including once at 3:31 a.m. the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney John Cline declined to comment on the access
allegations, saying he had not had an opportunity to discuss them
with Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, charged with 59 counts alleging security breaches, has
insisted he never passed secrets to anyone. And defense attorney
Mark Holscher said the prosecution filing means the government
cannot produce any evidence to the contrary. Monday was the
prosecution's deadline for listing additional evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the filing confirms that after four years of
exhaustive investigation, the government has absolutely no evidence
that Dr. Lee ever provided any information to any third party,''
Holscher said Monday. ''This (filing) is their list of any other
evidence that they may have against Dr. Lee, and it confirms what
we have told the court for the last several months.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney George Stamboulidis declined to comment.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- President Clinton, ready to address the 43rd Democratic
National Convention tonight, hoped to rally his party behind Vice President Al
Gore. ''We've worked closely together for eight years now,'' said Clinton in
prepared remarks. ''In the most difficult days of the last years, when we faced
the toughest issues -- of war and peace, of taking on powerful special interests
-- he was always there.'' First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton was to precede her
husband in a prime time speech. Today Gore and running mate Joseph Lieberman
campaigned in the Midwest.

   MOSCOW (AP) -- The Russian navy is trying to find a way to rescue more than

early Tuesday, about a dozen military ships including a nuclear-powered cruiser
were at the site, Russian reports said. The chance of a happy ending was ''not
very high,'' the navy chief conceded. The Kursk, one of Russia's biggest nuclear
submarines, was apparently involved in a collision before it plunged hundreds of

Safety Experts: Widen Tire Recall
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Safety advocates and attorneys suing Ford Motor Co. and
Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. accused the companies today of dangerously limiting
the size of a Firestone tire recall, and urged them to broaden it. Company
officials said their actions were sufficient and that the overwhelmingly
majority of complaints were from the tires being recalled. Bridgestone/Firestone
said last week it would recall all of the P235/75R15 size radial ATX and ATX II
tires, and Wilderness AT tires of the same size made in Decatur, Ill. The 6.5
million 15-inch tires in question were mostly installed on Ford vehicles,

   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Jenny Thompson, 2. Dara Torres, 0.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson showed again that she's the top woman in American
swimming, turning away Torres for the second time at the U.S.
Olympic trials and setting a national record in the 100-meter
freestyle Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Torres led by a split-second at the flip but Thompson pulled
away in the final 25 meters for a time of 54.07 seconds, eclipsing
the record of 54.27 that she set last month.
</P>
<P>
   Torres touched second at 54.62, while Ashley Tappin and Amy Van
Dyken finished 3-4 in a star-studded final to earn another trip to
the Olympics as members of the 400 freestyle relay team.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson also defeated Torres in the 100 butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1996 Atlanta Games, Van Dyken was the first woman to win
four gold medals in an Olympics. After two shoulder operations, she
resumed training in March and came to the trials trailing in the
wake left by Thompson and Torres.

<HEADLINE> Saints' Perry Apologizes For DUI  </HEADLINE>
By MARY FOSTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   THIBODAUX, La. (AP) -- New Orleans Saints safety Darren Perry met
with reporters Monday night and tried to put his drunken driving
incident behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reason I'm here is not to talk about the incident
specifically,'' Perry said. ''But really just to come here and
apologize to my teammates, the Saints organization, coach (Jim)
Haslett, and all the people that were instrumental in getting me
down here, for basically just bringing this kind of embarrassment
to the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry was charged with drunken driving early Sunday after
rear-ending a car with his Land Rover following a preseason game
against Indianapolis, police said. He failed a field sobriety test
and refused to take a breath-alcohol test., Kenner police Lt. Steve
Caraway said.
</P>
<P>
   Perry also was cited for a hit-and-run offense and careless
operation of a motor vehicle. All of the charges are misdemeanors.
</P>
<P>
   Perry, an eight-year veteran, signed with the Saints as a free
agent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Perry was convicted of DWI and hit and run in Greensburg, Pa.,
while with the Pittsburgh Steelers in December 1996 and was
sentenced to one year of rehabilitation and ordered to make $1,200
in damages.
</P>
<P>
   Perry said he spoke briefly to his teammates and apologized. He
said his agent advised him not to discuss the event.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd love to talk about it and I know you guys would love to
fill up your newspapers about it, but I can't do that right now,''
Perry said. ''I can't say much about the incident, other than to
say I came here for one reason only and that was to play football
and not to bring any outside distractions to this organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Haslett said he supports Perry, but Perry will have to deal with
the incident himself.

<HEADLINE> Golden State Hoops Sign Porter  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The Golden State Warriors signed
second-round draft pick Chris Porter on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Porter played at Auburn for two seasons and was named the
Southeastern Conference Player of the Year in 1999. The Warriors
selected him with the 55th overall pick in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe that Chris is willing to work hard and contribute
to this basketball team,'' Warriors General Manager Garry St. Jean
said. ''He performed well for our summer league team, and I think
that he will bring a lot of energy and athleticism to this club.''
</P>
<P>
   Porter, a forward, averaged 15.3 points and 8.0 rebounds in his
two years with Auburn.
</P>
<P>
   Porter was voted second team All-America his junior year and
received honorable mention All-America from his senior year.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Porter was declared ineligible and sat out the
final eight games of the season when it was discovered that he had
received payments from a Las Vegas sports agent and two of his
representatives. The NCAA refused to reinstate him and an appeals
panel upheld the decision.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Becky Hammon scored 19 points as the New York
Liberty defeated the Washington Mystics 78-57 Monday night and
advanced to the Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Tari Phillips added 15 points and 10 rebounds for the Liberty in
Game 2 of the best-of-three conference playoffs. New York will face
Tuesday's winner of the Cleveland-Orlando series on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, selected the WNBA's most improved player on Monday,
finished 7-for-11 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Chamique Holdsclaw scored 12 points on 6-for-15 shooting for the
Mystics, who bowed out of the first playoff appearance in the
franchise's three-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Markita Aldridge also had 12 points while Nikki McCray, who
averaged 15.5 points, was held scoreless.
</P>
<P>
   Vickie Johnson, Tamika Whitmore and Crystal Robinson scored 10
points apiece for the Liberty, who have won 11 straight home games.
New York's last home loss was a 72-67 setback on June 25 against
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty shot 52.5 percent from the field, including 6-for-12
from 3-point range. The Mystics were outscored 40-28 in the paint
and outrebounded 31-19.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead by 15 at halftime, New York extended the lead to 48-32 on
Phillips' third straight layup five minutes into the second half.
She left the game after getting an elbow in the mouth and chipping
her tooth with 11:53 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Wicks' 16-foot jumper gave the Liberty a 58-38 lead and
consecutive 3-pointers by Hammon and Robinson made it 64-42 with
8:03 left.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips sat out five minutes before adding a putback, and the
Mystics could get no closer than 68-50 the rest of the game.
</P>
<P>
   New York led 12-4 in the opening five minutes on Johnson's
baseline 3-point shot, which capped a 7-0 run. A tip-in by Wicks
extended the lead to 15 points before Vicky Bullett's two free
throws stopped a 9-0 Liberty run at 26-13 with 7:03 remaining in
the half.
</P>
<P>
   Three straight layups by Holdsclaw, who scored eight points in
the opening period, trimmed the lead to 26-19 with 4:55 remaining.
But New York closed out the half on a 14-6 run -- behind six points
Whitmore -- for a 40-25 halftime lead.

   Singleton said the convention and the pending election are a
chance for young people to have a say.
</P>
<P>
   ''This whole thing is about having a voice, and we have to fight
for that voice,'' he said. ''Eight years ago, we got the old people
out of (the White House).''
</P>
<P>
   Badu said many young minority people feel left out of the
political process. The challenge, she said, is to get them
involved.

<HEADLINE> N. Koreans Visit Families in South  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- A group of 100 separated family
members from North Korea arrived in South Korea Tuesday for
temporary reunions with relatives they have not seen for half a
century.
</P>
<P>
   A passenger jet of Air Koryo, North Korea's national airline,
ferried the aging family members from Pyongyang on a 50-minute
flight to Seoul's Kimpo airport and prepared to pick up 100 South
Koreans for similar exchanges in the North.
</P>
<P>
   Family reunions are one of the most emotional issues that have
defined the long standoff between the two Koreas, which were once
devoted to each other's downfall but have made great strides toward
reconciliation in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Rapprochement between the communist North and the democratic
South accelerated after their leaders held a summit in June and
pledged to work toward eventual reunification.
</P>
<P>
   That goal remains distant and complex, but events like the
family reunions -- the first since 1985 -- are likely to help
dissipate some of the animosity that has flourished since the
1950-53 Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   While this week's reunions constitute a political gesture of
good will between governments, they are a source of private joy,
discovery and pain for those involved.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Jung-ho, a 91-year-old South Korean, said he expected to
meet a 60-year-old son when he arrives in Pyongyang, the North
Korean capital. Kim, who bought watches and gold rings as gifts for
his relatives in the North, last saw his son when he fled alone to
South Korea in 1951 during the chaos of war.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first thing I want to ask him is: What happened to the
other family members? Then I would ask how he endured through all
those difficult years,'' Kim said before heading to the airport for
the flight to Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   The four-day reunions began on Aug. 15, a national holiday in
both Koreas that is the anniversary of the peninsula's liberation
from Japanese colonial rule at the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech broadcast live on national television, South Korean
President Kim Dae-jung vowed to work to end the threat of war
between the Koreas and pursue economic and other exchanges ahead of
reunification.
</P>
<P>
   ''Attempts at unification by force of arms and unification by
absorption taking advantage of economic superiority will only lead
to war and destruction,'' Kim told an audience of independence
fighters, political leaders and diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea, which has one of the largest economies in the
world, is far wealthier than North Korea, where poor centralized
planning, heavy military spending and bad weather have undercut the
economy and forced Pyongyang to appeal for outside food aid.
</P>
<P>
   The family members who arrived from Pyongyang were scheduled to
meet their South Korean relatives at a Seoul conference center
Tuesday afternoon. Their schedule includes private meetings in
hotel rooms, banquets and city tours.
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean visitors to the North had a similar schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Yo in-yul, an 81-year-old South Korean, fled his hometown in
Unyul, a town south of Pyongyang, in January 1951, with his wife, a
younger brother and a younger sister. He left behind a 9-year-old
sister, asking her to take care of his sick grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Yo expected to see his sister, Yo Jung-suk, on arrival in
Pyongyang Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''My heart is aching whenever I recall the moment of separation.
She held me by the hand and cried, begging me to take her along,''
Yo said.
</P>
<P>
   Family reunions are a pressing issue because many aging family
members have only a few years left to see relatives. Many people
have died without making contact with relatives. There is no mail,
telephone or other direct means of communication between private
citizens in the two Koreas.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rapprochement, uneasiness lingers in the South over
apparent political use of the event by the North.
</P>
<P>
   While South Korea chose its 100 finalists for the reunions
through a computer lottery, the North Korean list includes a
renowned poet, a painter, a film maker, a scientist and other
celebrated people. And all the Northern visitors are natives of
South Korea who defected to the North.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean critics said loyalty to the communist system
appeared to be the most important criterion for getting on the
North's list.

<HEADLINE> Rockies 4, Expos 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Todd Helton homered twice, including a go-ahead,
two-run drive in the ninth inning as the Colorado Rockies beat the
Montreal Expos 4-3 Monday night for a four-game sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Helton went 3-for-5 to raise his major league-leading average to
.394.
</P>
<P>
   With the Rockies trailing 3-0 in the eighth, he homered off
Anthony Telford. Then, after Jeff Cirillo hit an RBI single with
two outs in the ninth, Helton hit a two-run homer off Scott
Strickland (4-3), who has blown three of five save chances.
</P>
<P>
   Helton, who has 29 homers and 101 RBIs, has reached safely in 19
of 22 plate appearances during the first five games of the Rockies'
nine-game road trip. He had his eighth multihomer game of the
season, the 16th of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Craig House (1-0) allowed one hit in 1 1-3 innings, and Jose
Jimenez got three outs for his 16th save.
</P>
<P>
   Expos starter Javier Vazquez allowed seven hits in seven shutout
innings and tied his career high with 10 strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Rockies starter Julian Tavarez scattered four hits
while holding the Expos scoreless in the first six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal took a 3-0 lead in the seventh, when Lee Stevens
singled leading off and advanced to second on Geoff Blum's
hit-and-run chopper to shortstop. Andy Tracy was intentionally
walked and Michael Barrett followed with a drive off the
center-field wall that scored Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter Wilton Guerrero grounded to Helton, who stepped on
first, then thr home too late to get Tracy, who slid in ahead of
Brent Mayne's tag. Peter Bergeron followed with an RBI double.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Actor Tim Matheson was among a crowd of just 6,924 who
attended the game. ... Larry Walker pinch hit in the ninth and
grounded out. ... The Rockies had at least 10 hits in each of the
first five games of their current road trip, going 69-for-194
(.356) in those games. The Rockies were hitting a NL-low .232 on
the road prior to their current trip. ... Vazquez had nine
strikeouts against Cincinnati on July 29.

Health Minister Says Deal Is Nearer on Medicare Funding
<TEXT>
<P>
   SASKATOON, Saskatchewan (AP) -- Ottawa and the provinces are
closer than ever to reaching a deal on increased funding for
medicare, federal Health Minister Allan Rock told a doctors
conference Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's clear there's now a real convergence in the approaches of
the federal, provincial and territorial governments,'' Rock said
days after the premiers met to try to reach a common front on
revitalizing health care.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of money and how it's going to be paid out remains
the largest stumbling block to a deal, but Rock said both levels of
government have now identified some priorities. Those include the
supply of doctors and nurses, medical infrastructure, the use of
new drugs and health promotion and prevention.
</P>
<P>
   ''The prime minister and I are confident that while there still
remains work to do, the basis has been laid for a successful first
ministers meeting,'' he said, referring to a follow-up meeting the
premiers will have with Jean Chretien in September.
</P>
<P>
   Rock's comments to the Canadian Medical Association follow a
move by the premiers on Friday to ask Ottawa to restore $4.2
billion in transfer payments cut more than five years ago during
Finance Minister Paul Martin's campaign to eliminate the deficit.

Health Officials: Latest E. coli Cases Aren't Cause for Alarm
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Three children from Walkerton, Ontario who tested
positive for E. coli late last month became sick with the deadly
bacteria in the spring but never went to hospital, health officials
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth child picked up an infection in late July, possibly
through exposure to livestock, said Dr. Walter Ewing, associate
medical officer of health with the Bruce-Grey-Owen Sound health
unit.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the cases are a sign the bacteria that has haunted
Walkerton since May is making a comeback, Ewing said as he tried to
quell mounting anger and fear in the town of 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are no new cases associated with Walkerton -- they are
old cases that have been recently diagnosed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Three other patients who showed symptoms consistent with an E.
coli infection have tested negative for the bacteria, Waram said.
</P>
<P>
   Two of them, however, tested positive for camphyllobacter -- a
less virulent bacteria that leads to E.-coli-like symptoms, such as
telltale bloody diarrhea.

Federal Bid To Ban Native Lobster Fishermen Is Rejected
</P>
<P>
   MIRAMICHI, New Brunswick (AP) -- The federal Fisheries Department
got no sympathy from the New Brunswick court system Monday as it
attempted to ban some natives from the waters of Miramichi Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Four aboriginal men charged with obstructing fisheries officers
during a weekend confrontation near the Burnt Church First Nation
were released from custody after fisheries officials lost their bid
to have them outlawed from the bay and its contentious lobster
harvest.
</P>
<P>
   Fisheries officer Wayne Thompson described in provincial court
boat rammings and other incidents that have increased tensions in
the lobster dispute on Miramichi Bay in northeastern New Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors in the case wanted Judge Denis Lordon to put special
constraints on the release of the four fishermen -- specifically
that they not be allowed near, or on, the bay.
</P>
<P>
   But Lordon dismissed the request, noting that the Burnt Church
First Nation, where the four men live, is located on the banks of
the large bay.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend seizure and destruction of almost 750 traps set by
natives led to ugly confrontations between natives and fisheries
officers on the water. It also resulted in retaliatory native
blockades on a major public highway that runs by the Burnt Church
reserve.

Woman Convicted of Exploiting Foster Daughter Can't Appeal
</P>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- A woman convicted of sexually
exploiting the foster daughter who is now her live-in lesbian lover
will not escape a criminal record, the British Columbia Court of
Appeal ruled Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel dismissed Valerie Hetu's request to appeal
her conditional sentence without even hearing from the Crown.
</P>
<P>
   Hetu, 32, was convicted in March of sexually exploiting Candice
Prince in 1998 when the girl was 16.
</P>
<P>
   She received a six-month conditional sentence and was ordered to
perform 100 hours of community service work.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Watt, Hetu's lawyer, was seeking a conditional
discharge, which would have meant Hetu would have no criminal
record as she does now.
</P>
<P>
   Hetu and Prince met at church in 1998 and Hetu approached the
Ministry of Children and Families for permission to become the
girl's foster parent.
</P>
<P>
   Prince, then a troubled 16-year-old, came to live with Hetu and
her family several months later.
</P>
<P>
   About a month after Prince moved in, Hetu's former husband, Doug
Hetu, testified he witnessed the pair kissing on the couch.
</P>
<P>
   Prince remained in the home for four months while social workers
looked for another foster home, but there was no evidence of any
further sexual contact, he said.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon: US Vessel Didn't Hit Sub  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- No U.S. ship or submarine was involved in the
collision that Russian officials said caused one of their
submarines to plunge to the bottom of the Barents Sea, the Pentagon
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Two U.S. Navy submarines were operating in the area at the time
of the accident, and one reported having heard an explosion at the
site Saturday, a Clinton administration official said late Monday.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, is familiar with
U.S. intelligence reports on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials said the incident happened Sunday, but the
U.S. official said it was Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were some U.S. submarines in the area,'' the official
said. ''All indications are that there was no U.S. involvement (in
the accident). We know the U.S. units are OK.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Navy surveillance ship, the USNS Loyal, was monitoring
submarine movements in the vicinity of the Barents Sea at the time
of the accident but was far from the scene of the accident,
Pentagon officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials said the submarine Kursk, with a crew of more
than 100, apparently was in a major collision and sustained serious
damage.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have no indication that a U.S. vessel was involved in this
accident,'' Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. Craig Quigley said. He
would not say, however, whether a U.S. submarine was in the area at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart, with President Clinton at
the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, said the
administration ''made clear to the Russians that any assistance we
can offer is available.'' He said national security adviser Sandy
Berger reiterated this in a telephone conversation with Russian
officials. ''At this point there's been no request for our
assistance,'' Lockhart added.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. submarines normally monitor the movement of Russian
submarines. It was even more likely in this case because of the
size of the Russian naval exercise, which Pentagon officials
described as the largest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the major role submarines play in gathering foreign
intelligence, the Navy usually is reluctant to discuss details of
their movements.
</P>
<P>
   The Barents Sea is often patrolled by U.S. submarines. In 1993 a
U.S. submarine, the USS Grayling, collided with a Russian ballistic
missile submarine, causing slight damage to both vessels. A year
earlier, also in the Barents Sea, the USS Baton Rouge sub hit a
Russian sub, also causing minimal damage.
</P>
<P>
   Several major Russian military seaports are located on the Kola
peninsula and Russian vessels must transit the Barents Sea to reach
the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley said the U.S. military had not been asked to assist in a
potential rescue of the Russian crew. It was not clear what
assistance was possible, even if requested.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Navy has a rescue vessel designed to bring the crew of
a U.S. or allied submarine to safety, even at depths far beyond
that where the disabled Russian submarine rested. But U.S. military
officials said they were not certain whether the rescue vessel is
compatible with Russian submarines hatches.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. vessel, known as a Deep Submergence Rescue Vessel, is
designed for quick deployment in the event of a submarine accident.
The rescue vessel is transportable by truck, aircraft, ship, or by
a specially configured attack submarine. The only two such vessels
in the Navy's inventory are based in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   A retired U.S. Navy officer familiar with submarine rescue
operations said that when the Navy developed its rescue vessels in
the 1960s it told Russia and other submarine-faring nations how to
design their hatches to make them compatible with the rescue
vessel. The officer, who discussed the matter via telephone with
Pentagon reporters on condition of anonymity, said it was not known
whether the Oscar-class submarine involved in the accident has a
compatible hatch.
</P>
<P>
   Although the U.S. rescue vessels are used frequently in
training, they have never been used in an actual rescue.
</P>
<P>
   At the accident site, the 49-foot rescue vessel dives, conducts
a sonar search, and attaches to the disabled submarines hatch. The
rescue vessel can take aboard up to 24 personnel for transfer to
safety.
</P>
<P>
   The rescue vessels were developed as a result of the USS
Thresher submarine accident in the North Atlantic in April 1963, in
which all 129 aboard were lost. At the time, submarine operating
depths greatly exceeded the capabilities of rescue vessels. The
Deep Submergence Systems Project contracted with Lockheed Missiles
and Space Co. to produce a deep-diving rescue submarine, the first
of which was launched in 1970.

<HEADLINE> Mexico City Mayor OKs Abortion Fix  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico City's mayor on Monday approved a
proposal that would decriminalize abortion when the life of the
mother is threatened or when the fetus has severe birth defects.
</P>
<P>
   The move came days after legislators in the northern state of
Guanajuato voted to prohibit abortion in cases of rape, heightening
fears about the conservative agenda of the newly powerful National
Action Party.
</P>
<P>
   Vicente Fox was elected Mexico's leader July 2, becoming the
first opposition presidential candidate to defeat a member of
Mexico's ruling party, which has held the presidency for 71 years.
However, Fox, a member of National Action, has struggled to bury
historical fears of his party's socially conservative stance.
</P>
<P>
   The law in Mexico City -- a federal district with its own
legislature -- currently allows abortions in the case of rape. In
addition to decriminalizing abortion in some cases, the proposal
signed by Mayor Rosario Robles would also decrease from five to
three years the maximum prison sentence for women who voluntarily
have an illegal abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative must still receive the approval of Mexico City's
legislature before becoming law.
</P>
<P>
   In a thinly veiled reference to Fox's transition team, Robles of
the leftist Democratic Revolution Party asked that ''they abandon
the complicit silence that they have maintained recently over this
theme.''

   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Jenny Thompson, 2. Dara Torres, 0.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson showed again that she's the top woman in American
swimming, turning away Torres for the second time at the U.S.
Olympic trials and setting a national record in the 100-meter
freestyle Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Torres led by a split-second at the turn but Thompson pulled
away in the final 25 meters for a time of 54.07 seconds, eclipsing
the record of 54.27 that she set last month.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt like it was a well-managed and well-executed race,''
Thompson said. ''I was pleased to get a best time in such a
high-profile situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Torres touched second at 54.62, while Ashley Tappin of Colorado
Springs, Colo., and Amy Van Dyken of Lone Tree, Colo., finished 3-4
in a star-studded final to earn another trip to the Olympics as
members of the 400 free relay.
</P>
<P>
   ''This race I was practicing as a dress rehearsal for Sydney,''
Thompson said. ''I managed the noise of the crowd well and I know
it'll be 10 times louder in Sydney.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson also defeated Torres in the 100 butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   Torres, 33, has earned two spots on the Olympic team after
ending her seven-year retirement in July 1999. But her legs cramped
and she won't get another chance against her former training
partner.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson withdrew from the 50 free, which begins Tuesday,
because she already has a full racing schedule for Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ''My legs gave out on me at the 75 (meter) mark,'' Torres said.
''I don't know if it was the hard training I did up to this point,
but there's going to have to be adjustments made in the next four
weeks. I got out of the pool and I almost fell down.''
</P>
<P>
   At the 1996 Atlanta Games, Van Dyken was the first woman to win
four gold medals in an Olympics. After two shoulder operations, she
resumed training in March and came to the trials trailing in the
wake left by Thompson and Torres.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is probably my last go,'' said Thompson, who has won five
gold medals and a silver at the Olympics. ''I just wanted to make
sure I covered all my bases and did everything right.''
</P>
<P>
   Kristy Kowal of Athens, Ga., broke the eight-year-old American
record in the 200 breaststroke, finishing at 2 minutes, 24.75
seconds to make up for a devastating setback three days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously relieved, Kowal pumped her fist toward the crowd at
the Indiana University Natatorium, having eclipsed the record of
2:25.35 set by Anita Nall at the 1992 trials. In a twist of fate,
Nall announced her retirement a day earlier because of health
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Kowal, 21, joined University of Georgia teammate Courtney Shealy
on the Olympic team and posted the second-fastest time in the world
this year in the 200 breast.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank you for not losing faith in me,'' said Kowal, who missed
the team in the 100 breast by one-hundredth of a second.
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Beard of Tucson, Ariz., who won a gold and two silver
medals as a 14-year-old in Atlanta four years ago, showed her
career is back on track by finishing second in 2:26.79 to claim the
second ticket to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Beard held the lane marker and shook with excitement after
looking at the scoreboard. Having traded in her teddy bear for body
piercings and tattoos, she once again resembled the adorable
youngster who charmed Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was not really expecting to make it back,'' said Beard, who
slumped in the world rankings and took a sabbatical after 1996. ''I
didn't look at the board at first when I finished. I was scared.''
</P>
<P>
   In a race that went according to plan, world record holder Lenny
Krayzelburg breezed to his second spot on the Sydney squad by
winning the 200 backstroke at 1:57.31, while 17-year-old Aaron
Peirsol of Irvine, Calif., took the second berth at 1:57.98.
</P>
<P>
   But Krayzelburg came up well short of his record time of
1:55.87, continuing a trend that marked the trials through the
first six days. While several U.S. marks have fallen, the Americans
are still looking to make their first dent in the world record book
with the Sydney Games a month away.
</P>
<P>
   ''I promise you I'll be better in Sydney,'' said Krayzelburg,
who first made the team by winning the 100 backstroke.
</P>
<P>
   There were no surprises in the 200 individual medley, either.
Tom Dolan doubled on the Olympic team, following up his victory in
the 400 IM with a winning time of 2:00.81. Tom Wilkens, his chief
rival, was second at 2:01.38.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not the best event for me,'' Dolan said. ''It's a little
unnatural. It's nice to win and hope to go a lot faster in
September.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Hall Jr. of Phoenix streaked through the 50 freestyle,
leading eight qualifiers into the eight-man final at 21.91 seconds,
less than three-tenths of a second off the world record held by his
Russian rival, Alexander Popov.
</P>
<P>
   Hall went 21.93 in the morning preliminaries, breaking Matt
Biondi's 8-year-old record of 22.12 in the trials. Then, he went
even faster in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Crocker, the first product of a Maine-based program to make
the trials, showed he's more than a mere oddity. He took down
Biondi's 1988 trials record in the 100 butterfly with a preliminary
swim of 52.82.
</P>
<P>
   Crocker also was the top qualifier in the evening semifinals at
53.07.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay Benko of Los Angeles led the 200 backstroke semifinals
at 2:13.24. Brooke Bennett, the defending Olympic and world
champion from Plant City, Fla., went into the final of the 800 free
with the fastest time, 8:32.84.

<HEADLINE> Orioles 8, White Sox 2  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Jose Mercedes allowed one run in eight innings
to win his fifth straight decision, and Jerry Hairston and Luis
Matos homered as the Baltimore Orioles defeated the Chicago White
Sox 8-2 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes (8-4), the only Baltimore starter with a winning
record, is unbeaten in six starts since July 8. He allowed seven
hits, struck out five and walked three against a Chicago team that
leads the majors in runs.
</P>
<P>
   Hairston's leadoff homer sparked a four-run first inning against
Mike Sirotka (10-10), and Matos' first major league home run, a
three-run shot, made it 7-0 in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Magglio Ordonez had three hits and an RBI for the White Sox, who
own the best record in the AL (70-48) but are only 15-15 since the
All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Sirotka (10-10) gave up four earned runs, eight hits and five
walks in 3 2-3 innings. He's yielded 21 homers this year compared
to 24 all last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles batted around in the first inning, using four hits
and two walks to go up 4-0. Hairston homered on a 2-1 pitch before
Albert Belle, Brook Fordyce and Ryan Minor hit RBI singles.
</P>
<P>
   A walk and an error by third baseman Herbert Perry preceeded
Matos' drive to left-center in the third.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox finally scored in the sixth when Jose Valentin led
off with a double and scored on a single by Ordonez. A triple by
Chris Richard and a sacrifice fly by Fordyce made it 8-1 in the
bottom half.
</P>
<P>
   Fordyce was playing his first game against his former team since
the July 29 trade that sent Charles Johnson and Harold Baines to
Chicago. Johnson went 2-for-3 with a walk and an RBI single in the
ninth; Baines did not play.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Minor snapped an 0-for-9 skid with his first-inning single.
... Valentin committed his team-high 30th error at shortstop. ...
The Orioles stranded 12 runners, 10 through the fifth inning.

<HEADLINE> Protesters Confront L.A. Police  </HEADLINE>
By ANTHONY BREZNICAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- As the Democratic National Convention opened,
thousands converged on downtown Monday for a day of music and
demonstrations against corporate greed, oil company abuses and a
missile defense program. Nine protesters were arrested in a clash
with police.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation between police and demonstrators upset by Vice
President Al Gore's ties to Occidental Petroleum Corp. lasted less
than an hour and was the only one to turn violent.
</P>
<P>
   The group stopped at a busy intersection about six blocks from
the Staples Center convention hall. Police warned them to leave and
then, minutes later, charged with batons and pushed back about 200
protesters. About 400 others watched from up the street.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is what a police state looks like!'' a protester shouted
at the police.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest turnout, though, came Monday night for a concert
outside the convention by Rage Against the Machine, a rock band
whose most popular CD is named ''The Battle of Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   At least 8,000 gathered outside the hall, many of them marching
from downtown Pershing Square to protest a proposed missile defense
program. Demonstrators carried 50-foot replicas of Trident nuclear
missiles bearing the slogans ''$35 Billion for Nuclear Weapons,
Pennies for Our Schools.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fire Department sprayed a cooling shower of water over an
appreciative, festive crowd.
</P>
<P>
   People in the audience threw empty water bottles and fake dollar
bills -- left over from a protest against corporate greed -- into the
air. Some near the stage jumped up and down to the music and others
carried upside down American flags. Marijuana smoke wafted
overhead, drifting toward hundreds of police in riot gear lined up
between the crowd and the convention hall.
</P>
<P>
   Rage Against the Machine, known for its hard-driving sound, is
anti-authoritarian, fiercely committed to leftist politics and has
campaigned in support of such figures as Mumia Abu-Jamal, a former
radio reporter on death row for killing a Philadelphia police
officer in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are just speaking the truth,'' said Leslie Thulin, 48,
from San Diego. ''We have to take to the streets because we don't
have the money to buy our way into politics. This is our only way
to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere downtown, hundreds marched past buildings housing the
offices of big corporations they accused of undue influence in
political life. Some of the protesters called for campaign finance
reform; others wanted to highlight alleged corporate abuses.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to beat, beat back, the corporate attack,''
shouted the protesters, some of whom wore pig costumes to symbolize
corporate greed.
</P>
<P>
   In the confrontation with police, demonstrators used their own
bullhorn to taunt officers; others danced in front of the officers
to the beat of a drum. The smell of vinegar permeated the air.
Demonstrators poured it on rags to withstand tear gas, although
none was fired.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, a line of officers charged, knocking people down.
Protesters yelled, ''We're nonviolent!''
</P>
<P>
   Police handcuffed about nine protesters and booked them on
charges of failure to disperse. With their hands tied with plastic
binding, they chanted, ''Al Gore cut your ties, stop the drilling,
stop the lies.''
</P>
<P>
   During his campaign, Gore has been dogged by protesters over his
connection to Occidental. His father, the late Sen. Albert Gore
Sr., had served on Occidental's board, owned stock in the company
and served as chief executive of a subsidiary. His family inherited
as much as $500,000 worth of Occidental stock when he died in
December.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters have urged Gore to divest his family of that stock.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's government has granted Occidental the right to
conduct exploratory drilling a few miles outside the legal
boundaries of the U'wa Indian reserve.
</P>
<P>
   The U'wa believe oil exploration would bring violence and
destroy their culture. In 1997, the group threatened mass suicide
to discourage drilling in the South American country.

<HEADLINE> Braves 9, Padres 2  </HEADLINE>
By ED SHEARER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Tom Glavine became the NL's second 15-game winner
and Andres Galarraga hit a tiebreaking, two-run double Monday night
as the Atlanta Braves beat the San Diego Padres 9-2.
</P>
<P>
   Javy Lopez added a three-run homer in the fifth inning for the
Braves, who stopped San Diego's four-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   With the Braves' NL East lead down to 1&AMP;frac12; games coming in,
Glavine won for the eighth time in nine decisions and matched
Arizona's Randy Johnson for the most wins in the league. Coupled
with New York's 11-1 loss to San Francisco, the Braves increased
their lead back to 2&AMP;frac12; games over the second-place Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine (15-6) allowed five hits in seven innings and struck out
six, beating Jay Witasick (0-1), who gave up seven runs, eight hits
and five walks in 5 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   With the score 1-all in the fifth, Andruw Jones bounced a double
over the center-field fence, Chipper Jones was walked intentionally
and B.J. Surhoff advanced the runners with a slow groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga doubled on a 3-0 count and took third on a wild pitch.
Brian Jordan walked and Lopez followed with his 19th homer for a
6-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones had an RBI single in the sixth off Todd Erdos, and
Surhoff and pinch-hitter Bobby Bonilla added run-scoring singles in
the eighth off Heathcliff Slocumb.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Nevin had homered leading off the second, but the Braves
tied it in the bottom half on Keith Lockhart's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Atlanta OF Reggie Sanders is expected to be activated
Tuesday and George Lombard probably will be sent to Triple-A
Richmond. Sanders has been on the 15-day disabled list because of a
strained left hamstring since July 28. ... Team owner Ted Turner
and and Dale Murphy, a two-time NL Most Valuable Player and the
holder of 13 Atlanta records, were inducted into the Braves Hall of
Fame, joining last year's inaugural inductees: Hank Aaron, Eddie
Mathews, Phil Niekro and Warren Spahn. ... The game drew only
31,316, the fourth-smallest home crowd of the season. ... It was
only the fourth loss in the last 16 games for the Padres. ...
Nevin's homer was his 35th since becoming the Padres regular third
baseman on Aug. 10, 1999.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Packers Brooks Signs With Denver  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MOSSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREELEY, Colo. (AP) -- Saying he was eager to get started, wide
receiver Robert Brooks proved it, signing a one-year contract with
the Denver Broncos on Monday and immediately joining his new
teammates at training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, the former Green Bay standout who retired last August
because of a back injury, said he chose Denver's offer over those
of three other NFL teams because ''I think this is a good
situation. These guys have a tradition for winning. That's what I'm
used to, and that's where I wanted to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks' incentive-laden contract will pay him a reported
$750,000 that could go as high as $1.25 million.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, 30, had a favorable workout for the Broncos on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Confident he is recovered from the back injury that contributed
to his retirement, Brooks was adamant about signing a one-year deal
''so I can prove the skeptics wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot, 177-pound Brooks was one of the NFL's most prolific
receivers before his injury. His best year was 1995 when he caught
a career-best 102 passes for 1,497 yards and 13 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   He underwent back surgery in August 1998 to remove a herniated
disk, then had surgery again in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very healthy,'' said Brooks, who has been working out with
a personal trainer in his hometown of Phoenix for several months.
''I think it will show when I get out there on the practice field
and get an opportunity to play in a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how long he thought it would take to learn the offense and
begin making a contribution, Brooks said, ''When does practice
start? Tomorrow? First of all, it's not a new system. They run the
same system that I ran for seven years, so that will be an easy
transition. And as far as playing football, I think if you are a
player, you never forget how to play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Broncos coach Mike Shanahan agreed that Brooks' mental
transition should be seamless.
</P>
<P>
   ''The thing that's good is he's used to the same terminology,''
Shanahan said. ''The system is very similar to what he went through
in Green Bay relative to X, Y and Zs (receiver positions). So I
think he's going to pick that up a lot quicker than most.
</P>
<P>
   ''How fast can he come in and get in football shape? I think
that will take some time, probably two or three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're happy to have him. This will give us a chance to see
what he can do after being laid off for a year. He came in here in
great shape, and we're hoping he can come and help our football
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks won't immediately challenge for a starting job. He said
he was told frankly by Shanahan before he signed that Ed McCaffrey
and Rod Smith were the starters. The Broncos' backup positions are
in flux, however.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mike hasn't promised me anything, that's for sure,'' Brooks
said. ''I'm just coming in here trying to help this team win and do
whatever I can to contribute to the guys they already have.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks created the Lambeau Leap in Green Bay, jumping into the
stands after a touchdown. That will be more difficult at Mile High
Stadium, with its chain-link fence surrounding most of the field
and a high wall in the south end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ''I talked to (Broncos defensive tackle) Keith Traylor and he
said that if I can help bring some magic to this team, then we are
going to see about getting the fences taken down or getting the
stands lowered or something,'' Brooks joked. ''And Traylor is a big
guy, so I think we can get some things done.''

<HEADLINE> Two Food Convoys Head to Chechnya  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Two humanitarian convoys with desperately
needed food for Chechnya left neighboring Ingushetia on Monday, the
World Food Program said.
</P>
<P>
   The food delivery was announced as rebels mounted a wave of
attacks on Russian troops in the war-ravaged republic.
</P>
<P>
   The convoys are carrying supplies for 35,000 people facing
starvation in the Chechen capital, Grozny, and the border district
of Urus-Martin as a result of the long-running military conflict,
the World Food Program said.
</P>
<P>
   The Grozny convoy consists of 10 trucks carrying about 132 tons
of wheat flour, grain, and vegetable oil that will be distributed
to 31,000 people, WFP said. It will be distributed to elderly, ill
and handicapped Chechens along with single mothers and children who
were unable to flee the capital when fighting flared last winter.
</P>
<P>
   The second convoy of five trucks is carrying mixed food for more
than 3,500 displaced people from the village of Komsomolskoe in
Urus-Martan which was completely flattened during the flare-up in
fighting, it said.
</P>
<P>
   ''These civilian victims of the conflict in Chechnya are clearly
in a very dangerous situation, particularly the people in Grozny,''
Bhim Udas, WFP emergency coordinator for the northern Caucasus said
in a statement. ''They are the last in line for food access and we
are very anxious to get relief to them before they begin suffering
the effects of severe malnutrition.''
</P>
<P>
   Overnight Monday, rebel forces attacked Russian checkpoints 22
times, a major increase in activity after several days of quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Several Russian troops were wounded in the attacks, but it
wasn't known if any had died, officials said. Ten of the attacks
took place in Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels periodically strike Russian checkpoints and military
columns, but such a high number of attacks in one night was
unusual.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday afternoon, a powerful bomb went off about 10 yards
from an Emergency Situations Ministry installation in Grozny, but
there were no inuries, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Federal troops moved into Chechnya in September to end the
republic's de facto independence after a series of cross-border
raids by Islamic militants based in Chechnya and bombings in Russia
that Moscow blamed on the rebels last year. Russian troops withdrew
from Chechnya in defeat at the end of a 1994-96 war.

<HEADLINE> Rangers Pull Glynn For More Tests  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Texas pitcher Ryan Glynn, who fainted in
the dugout after being pulled out of his last game, was been
scratched from his scheduled start Wednesday to give team doctors
more time to evaluate his condition.
</P>
<P>
   Medical tests haven't determined why Glynn passed out in the
dugout after being taken out of Friday night's game. The Rangers
had originally said that Glynn would make his next start Wednesday
against the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Hunter, the team's internist, said Glynn would be put
through a series of medical tests over the next 7-10 days. Under
that timetable, Glynn (2-3) could miss at least two starts.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter said he had no new medical information, but felt
uncomfortable allowing Glynn to return to game action until the
tests could be completed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to find the cause and make sure it doesn't repeat
itself,'' Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   Glynn has no medical background that would explain the fainting.
After he threw 95 pitches Friday, when the game time temperature
was 98 degrees, speculation was that the pitcher may have suffered
from heat exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Heat may have provoked it, but I don't think it was the only
factor,'' Hunter said.

<HEADLINE> Astros 16, Pirates 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Moises Alou had two home runs for the second
straight game, and Chris Holt took a no-hit bid into the seventh
inning Monday night as the Houston Astros routed the Pittsburgh
Pirates 16-2.
</P>
<P>
   Holt (5-12), who finished with a five-hitter, didn't allow a hit
until Brian Giles' led off the seventh with a ball that went off
the glove of shortstop Tim Bogar behind second. Shortstop Julio
Lugo then picked up the ball and threw to first, but it wasn't in
time and Bogar hit his glove in disgust. Warren Morris singled to
right-center two outs later for the Pirates' first clean hit.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, which has scored 30 runs in its last two games, had 19
hits for the second straight day. Tony Eusebio and Bogar each went
4-for-5, both tying their career highs for hits.
</P>
<P>
   Alou, who homered twice Sunday at Philadelphia, went 3-for-4 and
tied a career high with five RBIs. He had his third multihomer game
of the season, the 16th of his career, raising his home-run total
to 22.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Silva (7-7) lost his third straight decision, giving up
nine runs, nine hits and three walks in 2 2-3 innings. Pittsburgh
has lost six of eight and 10 of 13.
</P>
<P>
   Holt pitched for the first time since Aug. 4, when Montreal's
Peter Bergeron hit a line drive off a cheek. Holt missed one start
because of a black eye and facial swelling.
</P>
<P>
   Holt, who had lost six of six decisions since July 14, pitched
his third complete game of the season, striking out five and
walking four. He was helped by double plays in the second and third
innings after a hit batter and a walk.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh got its runs in the ninth on Enrique Wilson's
sacrifice fly and Alex Ramirez's run-scoring single.
</P>
<P>
   Houston took a 4-0 lead in the first on Lance Berkman's RBI
double, Alou's sacrifice fly and consecutive RBI singles by Richard
Hidalgo and Eusebio.
</P>
<P>
   Eusebio hit a two-run double in a five-run third. After Silva
walked Billy Spiers with the bases loaded. Marc Wilkins relieved
and gave up a two-run double to Jeff Bagwell that made it 9-0.
</P>
<P>
   Alou homered on an 0-2 leading off the fourth, and Bogar's RBI
double increased the lead to 11-0. Alou hit a three-run homer in
the fifth, Daryle Ward led off the seventh with his second
pinch-homer of the season, and Bogar hit an RBI single for a 16-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Ramirez left the game after the second inning with a
bruised left hand. He went to a hospital for X-rays. ... Eusebio
extended his hitting streak to 17, his career best and the longest
for the Astros since Luis Gonzalez tied the team at 23 in 1997. ...
Alou has had seven five-RBI games. This was his first since April
26, 1998 at Montreal.

<HEADLINE> Bosox Saberhagen Makes Rehab Start  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Bret Saberhagen made his fourth rehab
start, pitching three innings for the Trenton Thunder in a 3-2 win
over the Norwich Navigators 3-2 in an Eastern League game Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen started the game and gave up one hit and two runs.
Trenton is the Double-A affiliate for the Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   The Navigators scored their runs in the first inning when Paul
Ottavinia hit a two-run homer off Saberhagen. The home run came
after Saberhagen walked leadoff hitter Donzell McDonald.
</P>
<P>
   The two-time Cy Young Award winner had surgery on his rotator
cuff during the winter, and has not pitched for Boston this season.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In an emotional last hurrah before the Democratic
Convention, President Clinton tonight asked voters to elect Vice President Al
Gore as his successor and to send first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton to the U.S.
Senate from New York. Clinton told Democrats that he has delivered on the
promise of 1992, saying, ''I ran for president to change the future, for those
left behind in America.'' He recalled: ''I made one of the best decisions of my
life: asking Al Gore to be my partner.''

   MOSCOW (AP) -- The Russian navy is trying to find a way to rescue more than

early Tuesday, about a dozen military ships including a nuclear-powered cruiser
were at the site, Russian reports said. The chance of a happy ending was ''not
very high,'' the navy chief conceded. The Kursk, one of Russia's biggest nuclear
submarines, was apparently involved in a collision before it plunged hundreds of

Safety Experts: Widen Tire Recall
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Safety advocates and attorneys suing Ford Motor Co. and
Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. accused the companies today of dangerously limiting
the size of a Firestone tire recall, and urged them to broaden it. Company
officials said their actions were sufficient and that the overwhelmingly
majority of complaints were from the tires being recalled. Bridgestone/Firestone
said last week it would recall all of the P235/75R15 size radial ATX and ATX II
tires, and Wilderness AT tires of the same size made in Decatur, Ill. The 6.5
million 15-inch tires in question were mostly installed on Ford vehicles,

<HEADLINE> More heavy rain in northwest N.J. brings more flooding and evacuations </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT
<TEXT>
<P>
   HACKETTSTOWN, N.J. (AP) - Heavy rain drenched northwestern New
Jersey on Monday for the second time in three days, straining more
dams to the breaking point and forcing hundreds of additional
evacuations.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman said she would ask the Clinton
administration to declare Morris and Sussex counties disaster
areas. She put both counties under a state of emergency, allowing
the state to order evacuations and activate New Jersey National
Guard units.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of Warren County were also inundated.
</P>
<P>
   No serious injuries have been reported since Saturday's
downpour, whose torrents damaged dozens of homes, devoured Newton's
water supply system, and claimed bridges, roads and dams.
</P>
<P>
   The cost will surpass $100 million, Whitman spokesman Peter
McDonough said. Estimates were not complete Monday, since some
areas were still under water and could not be assessed.
</P>
<P>
   As serious as the damage was, it paled in comparison to the
ravages of Tropical Storm Floyd 11 months ago, which caused about
$1 billion in damage, much of it in the central New Jersey towns of
Bound Brook and Manville.
</P>
<P>
   In Sussex County, an additional 100 homes were evacuated Monday
in Sparta and 150 homes in Byram, while some residents in
Ogdensburg were also urged to flee.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're up to our tail in alligators right now,'' Sussex County
emergency coordinator Eskil ''Skip'' Danielson said.
</P>
<P>
   Danielson said Monday night there were still serious water
problems in Byram and Stanhope and that damage assessment would
continue Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got so much work to do,'' Danielson said.
</P>
<P>
   In Warren County to the south, Hackettstown Mayor Roger Hines
advised 300 families in low-lying areas to leave their homes, amid
concern that upstream dams could burst. About a dozen people were
evacuated in Hackettstown Monday, according to Gary Wassel, deputy
coordinator of emergency management in Warren County. Wassel said a
downpour Monday night did not cause additional problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're watching carefully,'' Wassel said.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Raymond Rafferty said the hour-long downpour Monday night
seemed to have little effect.
</P>
<P>
   ''It didn't add to our mess,'' Rafferty said.
</P>
<P>
   The Musconetcong River, which flows out of Sussex County and
borders Morris and Warren counties, rose a foot an hour Monday
before cresting in mid-afternoon, said Red Cross spokeswoman Cathy
Derechailo.
</P>
<P>
   ''The river is expected to maintain its crest peak for two to
three days. So this is far from over,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency expected evacuations in downriver areas such as
Allamuchy and Byram would bring up to 200 people to its emergency
shelter at Hackettstown High School, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The school was reopened for shelter Monday, after the Red Cross
closed all six shelters that had opened Saturday afternoon amid the
downpour.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the state is investigating claims that 14 inches of
rain fell Saturday in Sparta when a storm system stalled over the
hilly region.
</P>
<P>
   A better estimate is 8 to 10 inches, said David Robinson, state
climatologist at Rutgers University.
</P>
<P>
   ''That 14 inches is probably high and we've traced that back to
the gauge that gave us that figure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Intermittent showers and thunderstorms continued Sunday and
Monday, adding to the misery and leaving 14,000 customers without
electricity in central and northern parts of the state served by
GPU Energy. Some sun was expected Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend forecasters did not impress Julie Lemieux, 38, of
Jefferson Township in Morris County, where a swollen stream behind
her house ran fast and brown, dumping a sandbar in her back yard.
</P>
<P>
   ''They didn't predict anything. Nobody warned us. The weather
forecast said, like, thunderstorms,'' Lemieux said.
</P>
<P>
   Others in Jefferson Township were able to begin cleanup efforts
Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Mlynarz sprayed mud off boat parts in a soggy, muddy back
yard. Several inches of water still stood in the yard along Lake
Hopatcong. On Saturday, rushing waters claimed his dock and garden.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just have a mess to clean up. I don't have any major
damage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among those evacuated Monday were 800 children at the Jefferson
Lake day camp in Byram, due to worries about the integrity of a
nearby dam.
</P>
<P>
   A freight line running parallel to Route 517 in Sussex County,
the New York Susquehanna &AMP; Western Railway, was closed at 1 a.m.
Monday because its bed was undermined, State Police spokesman John
Hagerty said.
</P>
<P>
   NJ Transit trains do not run on that track, but the agency
canceled rush-hour trains between Mount Olive and Hackettstown on
the Boonton and Morristown Line as a precaution in case a dam on
nearby Muscenetcong River burst, spokesman Michael Klufas said.
</P>
<P>
   The 60 commuters affected would be put on buses to Hackettstown
at the Netcong stop, Klufas said. The transit agency also said
there would be no bus or rail service out of Hackettstown Tuesday
morning because of the flooding. A spokeswoman said commuters
should go to the Netcong stop for the train.
</P>
<P>
   Rushing water destroyed the mains in Newton, so residents were
advised to boil water for drinking and cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Route 15, the major link to Sparta, reopened early Monday
morning after crews worked around the clock since Saturday night to
clear tons of silt and mud, and repave a stretch of the highway
north of Interstate 80, state Department of Transportation
spokesman John Dourgarian said. No cost estimate was available.
</P>
<P>
   Three bridges and parts of three roads were swept away in
Sparta, where Main Street residents were evacuated Sunday because
fire officials feared a mudslide.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, gawkers flocked to the area to take pictures, where a
road was covered by a swift-running brown river.
</P>
<P>
   The dam on Seneca Lake in Sparta burst over the weekend,
emptying it and leaving a 25-acre patch of mud.
</P>
<P>
   Other dams that have failed include those at Hawthorne Lake in
Sparta, Shawnee Lake in Jefferson, and Lake Tomahawk in Byram,
state officials said. In Stanhope, two sides of the small dam on
Furnace Pond washed away Sunday and the surge broke through the
windows of a nearby paper factory.
</P>
<P>
   Under watch were dams at Saginaw Lake in Ogdensburg, and Sunset
Lake in Sparta, Hagerty said.

<HEADLINE> Marlins 11, Dodgers 2  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Kevin Brown made his earliest exit in five years
Monday night, giving up nine runs in 1 1-3 innings against the
Florida Marlins, who beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 11-2.
</P>
<P>
   Brown (10-5), whose salary of $15.7 million is more than the
Marlins' starting lineup makes, gave up seven hits and was hurt by
sloppy infield defense. He allowed five earned runs, hiking his ERA
from 2.47 to 2.72.
</P>
<P>
   Former Dodgers outfielder Henry Rodriguez drove in four runs
with two doubles and a 451-foot solo homer to center. Rodriguez,
acquired in a trade July 31, had only one RBI in 10 previous games
with the Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Sanchez (8-8) pitched six innings and allowed two runs,
both on a first-inning double by Eric Karros. Florida beat Los
Angeles for the first time in seven meetings this year.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, the ace of the Marlins' 1997 World Series championship
team, didn't acknowledge jeers from the crowd of 8,345 as he grimly
left the game with one out in the second. It was his earliest
departure since June 22, 1995, when he lasted 1 1-3 innings for the
Baltimore Orioles against the Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran right-hander, winless in his past four starts, might
have been affected by a rainstorm that delayed the start for 57
minutes. The Marlins, who scored only four runs while being swept
last weekend by San Diego, scored four in the first off Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Castillo walked and Mark Kotsay singled for his first hit
in 16 lifetime at-bats against Brown. Rodriguez doubled home a run,
and another run scored when shortstop Kevin Elster bobbled Preston
Wilson's high-hopper for an error. Andy Fox's two-out, two-run
double put Florida ahead 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins added five more in the second. Sanchez singled, and
Castillo reached on a throwing error by third baseman Adrian
Beltre. Kotsay singled home a run, and Rodriguez followed with a
two-run double. Mike Lowell's RBI double to deep center knocked out
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The final run of the inning came home on a wild two-out throw by
second baseman Mark Grudzielanek, the Dodgers' third error. That
made the score 9-2.
</P>
<P>
   Florida pinch-hitter Dave Berg hit his first homer of the year
in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Brown's shortest outing was one-third of an inning Aug. 17,
1993, for Texas against the New York Yankees. ... Sanchez is 4-1
with a 2.45 ERA in his past eight starts. ... Marlins starters have
a 1.64 ERA in the past seven games. ... The Marlins are 9-19
against the NL West. ... Castillo was thrown out stealing with
Florida leading 9-2 in the third.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 4, Phillies 3  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Matt Williams had three RBIs, including a
tiebreaking single in the 11th inning that led the Arizona
Diamondbacks over the Philadelphia Phillies 4-3 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Johnson allowed two runs -- one earned -- and five hits in
six innings. He had 10 of Arizona's 16 strikeouts but walked four
and for the fifth straight start failed to win.
</P>
<P>
   Curt Schilling returned to Philadelphia for the first time since
a five-player trade sent him to Arizona on July 26. But Schilling,
the Phillies' former ace, isn't scheduled to pitch in the series.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Bell led off the 11th with a double off Jeff Brantley (1-7),
took third on a groundout by Luis Gonzalez and scored on Williams'
single.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Plesac (2-0) pitched a perfect 10th, and Matt Mantei got his
10th save in 12 chances with a perfect 11th.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Glanville tied the game at 3 with a homer leading off the
seventh on the first pitch thrown by reliever Russ Springer.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Vosberg and Vicente Padilla combined for four shutout innings
in relief. Vosberg didn't allow a hit in 2 2-3 innings. Padilla,
acquired in the Schilling deal, allowed one hit in 1 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   After walking Glanville leading off the first, Johnson struck
out six consecutive batters. He also struck out the side in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The five-game winless streak is a season-high for Johnson, who
is stuck at 15 wins. It's the longest he has gone without a victory
since losing five straight starts last season, a stretch that
included four consecutive shutouts on a no-hitter, one-hitter,
two-hitter and three-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona had taken a 3-2 lead with three, two-out runs in the
sixth off starter Kent Bottenfield.
</P>
<P>
   After Jason Conti and Johnson struck out to start the inning,
Tony Womack tripled to center and Bell walked. Gonzalez cut it to
2-1 with a bloop single and Williams followed with a two-run
double.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield, making his third start since coming to the Phillies
in a trade for Ron Gant on July 30, cruised until the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed three runs, four hits and had eight strikeouts in six
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Sefcik's RBI bouncer gave the Phillies a 1-0 lead in the
third.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield reached on a fielder's choice, went to third as
Williams threw wildly on an infield single by Glanville and scored
on Sefcik's high chopper to short.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies loaded the bases in the fourth on singles by Kevin
Jordan and Alex Arias around a walk to Brian Hunter. But Johnson
struck out Tom Prince and Bottenfield to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Glanville led off the fifth with his second infield single of
the game, stole second and scored on Scott Rolen's single to left
as the Phillies took a 2-0 lead.
Notes: Johnson reached double digits in strike outs for the 18th
time this season and 143rd time in his career. ... Rolen is
12-for-25 with 6 RBIs in his last six games. ... Womack extended
his hitting streak to 11 games. ... Bottenfield was 3-0 against the
NL in four starts with Anaheim. ... RF Jason Conti made a running,
shoestring catch to rob Rolen of extra bases in the seventh. ...
Glanville reached base four times for the first time since May 24.
... Arizona recalled OF David Dellucci from Triple-A Tuscon on
Monday to take the spot vacated when reliever Johnny Ruffin was
placed on the disabled list Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Democratic Delegates Hear Lawmakers  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Members of Congress are used to speaking to a
nearly empty chamber. On Monday, a parade of lawmakers and
candidates addressing the Democratic National Convention got a
bonus: Some delegates actually listened.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, many of the Democrats in the noisy Staples Center for the
gathering's opening hours were renewing acquaintances, taking
pictures of each other, or simply wandering the aisles. And during
the afternoon many of the seats were empty, which some delegates
blamed on traffic jams outside.
</P>
<P>
   But as Senate candidate Bill Nelson of Florida, Sens. Robert
Torricelli of New Jersey and Barbara Boxer of California, and
others contrasted their party with the Republicans, many others in
the hall were paying rapt attention.
</P>
<P>
   ''This gives us information we need,'' said Eve Lee, an
attentive delegate from Los Angeles, from beneath a pink baseball
cap to which she had sewn a stuffed elephant. ''And we're getting
energized to carry the message out to the community.''
</P>
<P>
   The message the lawmakers delivered seemed designed to fire back
at Republicans, who used their own convention two weeks ago to push
their party toward the political center by casting themselves as
moderate and racially diverse.
</P>
<P>
   ''On every issue that is important to American families, there
is a real and lasting difference'' between Democrats and
Republicans, said Torricelli, who heads his party's Senate campaign
effort.
</P>
<P>
   He said Democrats were the true champions of proposals for
prescription drug benefits, pay equity, and stricter gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer, countering GOP charges that the Clinton administration
was one of missed opportunities, cited a litany of accomplishments
including balancing the budget and reducing the crime rate.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had our chance, we led, we led,'' Boxer said to cheers.
</P>
<P>
   By evening, the convention hall was packed with delegates
anticipating addresses by Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton
and President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Leading up to that were speeches by the Senate's six women
senators -- Boxer, Dianne Feinstein of California, Blanche Lincoln
of Arkansas, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Barbara Mikulski of
Maryland and Patty Murray of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Each focused on Democrats' plans in one area: the environment,
schools, Social Security and Medicare, law enforcement and other
issues.

<HEADLINE> Ervin May Be First Black on US Team  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Anthony Ervin is virtually assured of
becoming the first black on a U.S. Olympic swim team. He's not
taking any chances.
</P>
<P>
   Ervin, of Valencia, Calif., was second-fastest in the semifinals
of the 50-meter freestyle Monday night, becoming only the fifth man
to break 22 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   He went 21.92 to finish one-hundredth of a second behind Gary
Hall Jr. The top two in Tuesday's eight-man final earn automatic
Olympic berths.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't expecting it,'' Ervin said. ''I was just hoping and
now that I've done it, I have a lot of confidence going into
finals.''
</P>
<P>
   Ervin, who has a black father and a white mother, all but locked
up his Olympic berth by finishing fifth in the 100 free Sunday
night. The top four are guaranteed spots in the 400 free relay, and
the next two are likely to go, too.
</P>
<P>
   Ervin said he looks forward to swimming next to Hall in the 50
free final.
</P>

   ''He lets me know where I am in the race,'' Ervin said. ''It's
always good to have someone who's going to push you in the next
lane.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other blacks hoping to join Ervin in Sydney didn't make the
team.
</P>
<P>
   Sabir Muhammad of Atlanta was ninth in the 50 free semifinal at
22.75, failing to advance to the final by 0.04 seconds. Muhammad
finished last in the 100 free final.
</P>
<P>
   In the 100 butterfly, Byron Davis of Los Angeles was last among
16 qualifiers in the semifinals at 55.63. Like Muhammad, he had to
finish among the top eight to reach the final.
</P>
<P>
   Davis took solace that Ervin has apparently made the team.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's bound to happen, and I'm glad,'' Davis said. ''Now, we
don't have to talk about it.''

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton thanks adoring crowd for support in good times -- and bad </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton thanked Americans and
an adoring convention audience Monday night ''for your faith and
support in good times - and in bad,'' completing her unprecedented
transformation from first lady to New York Senate candidate.
</P>
<P>
   In a to-die-for opportunity for a fledgling candidate, the first
lady's 15-minute, prime-time address to the Democratic National
Convention came just before President Clinton offered his political
farewell to the party faithful.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the stage as the band played ''New York, New York,''
thunderous cheers cascaded upon her and hundreds of ''Hillary''
signs waved in the sea of delegates. New Yorkers held up individual
letters spelling out ''Senator Hillary.''
</P>
<P>
   In her speech, she hailed her husband's administration and
called for voters to elect Al Gore and Joseph Lieberman to carry on
that work.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have what it takes,'' the first lady said. ''And they'll
do what it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   She drew the strongest applause when she spoke about the need
for abortion rights, gun control, tax cuts for the neediest and
reprised her oft-repeated contention that ''it takes a village.''
</P>
<P>
   In an address that turned highly personal, Clinton said, ''Bill
and I are closing one chapter of our lives and soon we'll be
starting a new one. For me, it will be up to the people of New York
to decide whether I'll have the privilege of serving them in the
United States Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said that ''the other day, Bill and I were looking at
pictures of our daughter from eight years ago, when this journey
began. It's been an amazing eight years for Chelsea, too. And we
want to thank the American people for giving her the space to
grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, husband and Chelsea watched the speech from a
holding room behind the podium, the president waiting to take the
stage.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates couldn't get enough of her.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the beginning of a great career, a great mission,'' said
Michigan delegate Lupe Ramos Montigny. ''It's the beginning of the
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton took his turn on the stage, he claimed a moment of
''personal privilege'' to speak warmly of his
wife-turned-candidate. ''She's always been there for our family,
and she'll be there for the families of New York and America,'' he
said to raucous cheers. Mrs. Clinton grinned from a VIP skybox,
nephew Zachary Rodham in her arms, Chelsea at her side.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, the first lady's speech touched on familiar themes
from the Senate campaign she's been waging for 13 months.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is only one choice in this election whether we're
talking about president, vice president or senator from New York
and the right choice is to keep going forward together,'' she said
earlier in a speech to delegates from New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've made so much progress in the last eight years. We are a
stronger and better country than we were in 1992, but we have work
to do and we have challenges ahead,'' she told delegates from her
adopted state.
</P>
<P>
   Her appearances before adoring crowds here completed her odyssey
from a ''Goldwater Girl'' in the 1960s to a darling of the
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In her evening speech, Clinton stressed her 30-year fight on
behalf of children, saying ''Don't let anyone tell you this
election doesn't matter. The stakes in November are the biggest for
those who are the littlest among us.''
</P>
<P>
   Her thank you to the nation came at the end of her speech, and
seemed an oblique reference to President Clinton's infidelity and
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank you for your faith and support in good times - and in
bad,'' she said. ''Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for the
honor and privilege of a lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady's starring role was in sharp contrast to the role
her Republican opponent played at the GOP convention in
Philadelphia two weeks ago. Rick Lazio, a little-known congressman
from Long Island, stopped at his party's convention for only one
day and didn't speak before the gathering.
</P>
<P>
   For the first lady, her four-day visit to Los Angeles was a
nonstop celebrity affair. She appeared on ''The Tonight Show'' with
Jay Leno on Friday and picked up $1 million for her campaign at a
star-studded Hollywood tribute to her husband on Saturday night.
Before her convention speech Monday, she had interviews with the
three major television networks.
</P>
<P>
   In one pre-convention interview, CNN's Larry King asked the
first lady how she was doing emotionally in the wake of her
husband's affair with Monica Lewinsky. As she has in the past,
Clinton refused to talk about that.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know that's my business, and I don't talk about my
personal business and I feel strongly that what goes on in a
marriage or a family should remain in that marriage and in that
family,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Raised in a Republican household near Chicago, her
transformation into a Democrat began when she headed off to
Wellesley College. At Yale law School, she met her future husband
and began her lifelong work as an advocate for children.
</P>
<P>
   Republican critics have long maintained that her Senate run is
really meant to be a stepping stone to one day becoming the
nation's first female president. Clinton denies any such ambition.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have seen this up close and personal,'' she said on NBC.
''You know, I think that it's a big price that anybody has to pay
to do this. And right now, for me, the most important job we face
is electing Al Gore and Joe Lieberman.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in New York, which Clinton has called home only since
January, polls show her in a tight race with Lazio, who announced
his candidacy in May after New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
withdrew due to prostate cancer and marital problems.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady's own well-publicized marital problems are
considered one reason she trails Lazio in the polls among white
women, a critical voting block in New York. She also trails among
male voters and is running below the 60 percent level among Jewish
voters that analysts believe she needs to win. She has already
asked Lieberman, the first Jew to be chosen for a major party
ticket, to campaign for her in New York.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Laud Ordinary Americans  </HEADLINE>
By CALVIN WOODWARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Yvette Evans talked of the simple pleasures
of owning a home. David Skromme spoke of starting a small business
and making it a little bigger: ''Now I can pay my bills.''
</P>
<P>
   And David Robar described a government program that helped him
go back to work despite a spinal cord injury that left him a
quadriplegic. ''Who you are is what you do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mixing high-octane rhetoric with low-key testimonials, Democrats
on Monday used average people on the stage of their national
convention to put the personal into their policies.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the people's prosperity,'' Labor Secretary Alexis
Herman said. ''It is their toil.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to show that the recent years of economic growth
are not just some zagging lines on an economist's chart, and that
concepts like ''community policing'' can actually make life safer
on big-city streets.
</P>
<P>
   ''Crime is down for the eighth year now in Chicago,'' said one
of its policewomen, Grace Delgado. ''It's incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans choreographed their convention in Philadelphia two
weeks ago to showcase minorities and people who have done well when
the government gets off their backs. The Democratic orchestration
is illustrating what a government program here and there can help
people do.
</P>
<P>
   But the ''success stories'' segment of the convention's opening
night made for clunky TV on occasion, as Democratic officials fired
off loud partisan shots while prompting their guests to explain how
Democratic ideas have benefited them so.
</P>
<P>
   ''Opportunity lost?'' Herman asked, gearing up to attack
Republicans for portraying the past eight years as a lost
opportunity. ''Let's try memory lost.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only lost opportunity is that Bill Clinton and Al Gore did
not take over from Republican recession economics a whole lot
sooner,'' Herman said. Democrats have segments scheduled every day
of this week's convention featuring average people.
</P>
<P>
   Evans and her husband, Frederic, from Winston-Salem, N.C., said
low interest rates helped them buy their first home. ''It's the
simple things we're appreciative of,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Skromme of San Mateo, Calif., started a business that makes
signs. He was brought forward to illustrate the small businesses
created during the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   However, he created his small business in 1991, before the
Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Rosel Jr., a third-generation steelworker at Bethlehem
Steel in Pennsylvania, talked about the industry's return to
health.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Casey of Chantilly, Va., said the Family and Medical
Leave Act allowed her to leave her job to be with her father in
Michigan in the two weeks before he died.
</P>
<P>
   And Maria Elizabeth Fuentes of Tulsa, Okla., said the earned
income tax credit helped her through big medical bills and should
let her buy a home with her two girls. ''I have never considered it
was a handout.''
</P>
<P>
   Robar, who lives in Concord, N.H., said he was able to go back
to work despite his spinal cord injury because of
Democratic-sponsored changes in the Medicaid program. ''It's a very
exciting time for me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A little earlier, Democrats heard from convention committee
chairman Terrence McAuliffe, who had stepped in when convention
financing was tight and raised millions of dollars for the event,
as he raises millions for the party.
</P>
<P>
   He was even the subject of a gauzy video presentation,
indicating, it seemed, that fund-raisers are real people too.

<HEADLINE> Campaign Polls Show Diverse Numbers  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The increasing importance of issues over
leadership skills in a new poll of likely voters could be good news
for Democrat Al Gore if the trend holds up.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to the likely Democratic nominee have maintained for
months that if the election turns to issues, his strength on topics
like health care, Social Security, the environment and women's
issues like abortion could improve his standing in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Bush consistently leads in measures of leadership skills and
personal likability.
</P>
<P>
   A CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll taken Thursday and Friday found that
46 percent thought a candidate's stance on issues is most
important, while 36 percent said leadership skills and vision are
most important.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is important because this is one of the central goals of
the convention, and it's already happening,'' said Democratic
pollster Celinda Lake. She said it's important for Democrats to
shift the focus of the election to issues, rather than personality.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Sullivan, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said the Texas
governor ''offers strong leadership and strong positions on the
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll results are a reversal from that poll in March, when 50
percent said leadership skills and vision were more important than
a candidate's positions on issues. In fact, leadership skills
scored higher all year until July, when issues and leadership ran
about even.
</P>
<P>
   Other polls have asked for months whether positions on issues or
personal character were more important -- a different question -- and
issue positions consistently scored higher than character. Lake
noted the leadership question is a more potent choice, ''because if
you can't lead, nothing else matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Two thirds in the CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll said Bush has the
personality and leadership skills a president should have, while
half said Gore had those qualities.
</P>
<P>
   While the increased focus on issues could be a plus for Gore,
there was other more troubling news in the poll for the Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Almost half, 47 percent, of likely voters said there was no
chance they would vote for Gore, while just 30 percent said that of
Bush. Bush led Gore among likely voters 55 percent to 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Several polls have shown Bush with a 10 point lead among
registered voters, including a poll by ICR of Media, Pa., which
showed Bush at 45 percent, Gore at 35 percent, Ralph Nader at 6
percent and Pat Buchanan at 3 percent. The poll of 786 registered
voters taken Wednesday through Sunday had an error margin of 4
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Some polls have shown the race closer, including an NBC-Wall
Street Journal poll released Sunday showed the race closer, with
Bush at 44 percent and Gore at 41 percent among registered voters.
</P>
<P>
   Almost half in the CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll said they thought
Gore deserves at least a fair amount of credit for the state of the
economy, however. Three-fourths thought his performance in handling
the economy would be about the same as or better than President
Clinton's. More than half, 58 percent, thought he would do a better
job of providing moral leadership for the country.
</P>
<P>
   The poll of 641 likely voters was taken Thursday and Friday and
has an error margin of plus or minus 4 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Biden: Move Past Indiscretions  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- On the day of President Clinton's emotional
convention farewell, Sen. Joseph Biden told Democratic delegates
the party must move past Clinton's ''incredible indiscretions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Delaware senator, speaking at a caucus of Iowa delegates,
said of the remainder of the presidential campaign: ''I think we
should make this election about integrity, I think we should make
this election about honesty. Not shy away from it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have been so cowered as a party by a guy I love, Bill
Clinton's incredible indiscretions.''
</P>
<P>
   The comments came a few hours before Clinton was to give his
final convention speech as the party's leader in one of the
gathering's emotional high points.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt the very same outrage as every other American felt
about what he did,'' Biden told the Iowa delegates. ''But we should
not because of that back away from anything relating to integrity
and honesty.''
</P>
<P>
   Biden, who has known Clinton for many years, also described a
telephone call he said occurred during the Monica Lewinsky
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''He called me after his first speech relative to the scandal.
Five minutes after, the phone rings. He asks me what I think. I
said, you don't want to know what I think. He said, what do you
mean? I said, you are lucky you are not standing in my library with
me. He said, why? I said, because I'd knock you on your ass.''

<HEADLINE> Yankees 7, Rangers 3  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN HAWKINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Andy Pettitte pitched seven strong
innings before tiring in the eighth, getting his fifth straight win
as the New York Yankees continued their dominance over Texas with a
7-3 victory Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte (14-6) allowed just four hits while shutting out Texas
the first seven innings, but the Rangers started the eighth with
three straight singles, the third by Chad Curtis driving home a
run. Pettitte was pulled after he hit Rusty Greer to load the bases
with no outs.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Posada and Derek Jeter both hit long two-run homers as New
York beat Texas for the ninth straight time, including all six this
season and a three-game sweep in the first round of last year's
playoffs. Overall, the Yankees have won 38 of 49 between the teams
since the opening game of their 1996 playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   New York led 2-0 after just two batters were up. Jeter was hit
on the leg by a pitch and Posada followed with his 22nd homer of
the season, a 424-foot blast to left.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter, who had an RBI double in the fifth, hit a 412-foot homer
to left-center when the Yankees scored three runs in the sixth.
David Justice led off the inning with a double and scored on Scott
Brosius' single before Jeter's 11th homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius added an RBI double in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Perisho (2-5) lost his fifth straight start despite
striking out eight in six innings. Perisho, who allowed eight hits
and walked three, is winless in 10 starts since winning his first
start June 17 at Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees rookie reliever Randy Choate walked the only batter he
faced to force home a run in the eighth. Jeff Nelson then coaxed an
infield popout from Gabe Kapler, who earlier extended the longest
hitting streak in the majors this season to 27 games.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Stanton got the last two outs of the eighth, but not before
pinch-hitter Frank Catalanotto drove in another run with a
fielder's choice grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the shaky ending, Pettitte has allowed just 10 earned
runs over the 35 2-3 innings he has pitched during his five-game
winning streak. He struck out three and walked one.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Paul O'Neill, who struck out three times against Perisho,
has just two hits in 29 at-bats (.069) and is hitless in 14
at-bats. ... The Yankees have won 13 of their last 16 games in
Arlington, including a three-game series sweep in April. ... Texas
RHP Ryan Glynn, who fainted in the dugout after being pulled from
his last game, was scratched from his scheduled start Wednesday.
Medical tests haven't determined why Glynn passed out in the dugout
after being taken out of Friday night's game. ... At 54-62, Texas
is eight games below .500 for the first time since the end of the
1997 season. ... Luis Alicea snapped an 0-for-16 slump with an
eighth-inning single.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Warnings Posted in Texas  </HEADLINE>
By MEGAN K. STACK

   BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- Hurricane warnings were posted along
230 miles of coastline in Texas and Mexico and thousands of people
were urged to head for higher ground Monday as Tropical Storm Beryl
formed in the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in South Texas filled 20,000 sandbags, closed
government offices and tested generators. People nailed plywood
over windows, parks were closed and documents were moved into
waterproof storage areas.
</P>
<P>
   Beryl reached tropical storm status when its sustained winds
reached 40 mph. It was expected to reach hurricane strength --
sustained winds of at least 75 mph -- shortly before coming ashore
Tuesday somewhere near the U.S.-Mexico border, said James Franklin
at the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   By 11 p.m. EDT, Beryl had sustained winds of 50 mph. It was
centered about 115 miles south of Brownsville and was moving
west-northwest at 8 mph. Winds of 20 to 30 mph were blowing in
Brownsville, and light rain was falling. If it continues at its
current clip, Beryl may not have time to grow into a hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Brownsville in Cameron County, where the Rio Grande
empties into the gulf, residents of low-lying colonias, or
shantytowns, were urged to seek shelter. An estimated 20,000 people
live in those rural neighborhoods, known for flimsy construction
and inadequate drainage that make them vulnerable to severe
flooding.
</P>
<P>
   ''We probably won't see massive destruction, but people will
need to get out of those houses,'' said county Judge Gilberto
Hinojosa.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also urged residents of South Padre Island to head for
the mainland. At its highest, South Padre is only 16 feet above sea
level.
</P>
<P>
   Beryl was expected to be just barely a hurricane, but a storm
surge of 2 to 5 feet was predicted along the coast and 5 to 10
inches of rain could fall in 24 hours, Franklin said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government issued a hurricane warning for a 100-mile
stretch from Baffin Bay, just south of Corpus Christi, to the
Mexican border. The Mexican government issued a hurricane warning
from the border south to La Pesca, a stretch of about 130 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Hurricane Alberto gradually lost strength Monday as
it moved over cooler water in the North Atlantic and was downgraded
to a tropical storm.
</P>
<P>
   At l0 a.m., Alberto had sustained winds of 70 mph, down from 115
mph Saturday. Additional weakening was forecast over the next
several days.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto was about 610 miles west of the Azores Islands, west of
Portugal, and was moving east near 21 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks like it's going to stall out in the middle of the
Atlantic Ocean,'' hurricane center forecaster Miles Lawrence said.

<HEADLINE> Brewers Place Jose Hernandez on DL  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- The Milwaukee Brewers placed infielder Jose
Hernandez on the 15-day disabled list, retroactive to Aug. 11, on
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, who signed a three-year, $10 million free-agent
contract to be Milwaukee's everyday third baseman, is hitting .247
with 11 homers and 53 RBIs while striking out a team-high 110
times. He hit safely in five of the last six games he played.
</P>
<P>
   He was scratched from the Brewers' lineup on Friday when he was
seized with back spasms that made it nearly impossible for him to
walk. Hernandez, who saw a chiropractor over the weekend and was
prescribed rest, was seen on crutches in the Brewers' clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee recalled infielder Mark Sweeney from Triple-A
Indianapolis to replace Hernandez. Sweeney, who hit .217 in 39
games with the Brewers this year, is hitting .509 (28-for-55) with
14 RBIs in 18 games for Indianapolis.
