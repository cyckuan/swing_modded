LONDON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- A Roman Catholic man in his early

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa Saturday called on Zimbabweans to keep striving for
economic independence, after having won political independence
from British colonialists in 1980.
</P>
<P>
Addressing thousands of people at the Great Zimbabwe Monument
near Masvingo, over 300 km south of Harare, Mkapa noted that the
struggle for such independence would be won in the end, the
Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"We won the war of liberation but the struggle continues for
economic emancipation," said Mkapa at the rally, which marked the
last official engagement of his four-day state visit to Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
However, Mkapa warned the Zimbabweans to watch
out against some "adversaries" in the struggle for economic
freedom.
</P>
<P>
"They stood by during the struggle for liberation. Now they
are very free with their advice. They were very mean when we
were fighting. Now they are free with advice about what
constitutes democracy. They want to teach us about the meaning
of dictatorship," he said.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent reference to Zimbabwe's last colonial ruler
Ian Smith, Mkapa said, just as "some people" had said blacks
would not rule this country for a long time, they also thought
black economic empowerment might never be achieved.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mkapa wound up his visit with a news conference at
Harare International Airport where he called for strengthening of
economic and political relations between Zimbabwe and his
country.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe said the visit by the
Tanzanian president had solidified relations between the two
countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The national executive of the
Zimbabwe National Liberation War Veterans Association (ZNLWVA)
Saturday resolved to hold congress from May 8 to 10 with demands
for a quota of positions in the cabinet high on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
They also demand positions in the ruling Zimbabwe Africa
National Union Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) politburo, parliament
and the diplomatic service, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
ZNLWVA National Chairman Chenjerai Hunzvi, whose entire
executive will be seeking re-election, said the congress will be
held at Umzingwane High School at Esigodini in Matabeleland South
Province.
</P>
<P>
According to Hunzvi, the ZNLWVA was seeking quotas in the
various sectors of the public service to enable the "liberators"
to participate in all spheres of the government.
</P>
<P>
"This will mean that we will be able to participate in all
functions and matters of the state," he said without giving
specific figures for the number of posts the war veterans want in
each sector.
</P>
<P>
The ZNLWVA will also seek to strengthen its financial position
through mobilizing funds from among the veterans' recently paid
back-dated pensions by the state in recognition of their role in
the war that ended with Zimbabwe's independence in 1980.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Greek Lieutenant General Dimitris
Demou became the new Commander of Cyprus' National Guard Saturday,
replaying his compatriot predecessor.
</P>
<P>
During a ceremony at the army's headquarters here, he formally
replaced Lieutenant General Nicolaos Vorvolakos who headed the
10,000-strong Cypriot troops in the last four years.
</P>
<P>
The replacement came in the framework of a 1993 joint defense
agreement between Athens and Nicosia, under which Greece will
provide military assistance to the island country in case it is
attacked.
</P>
<P>
At present, many officers in Cyprus' National Guard are from
Greece.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the
Mediterranean island after a pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has maintained about 40,000-strong troops in northern
Cyprus, which was declared by Turkish Cypriots in 1983 as a
breakaway republic, but recognized only by Ankara.

<HEADLINE> British Gas Loses 20,000 Customers A Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Some 20,000 domestic gas customers
a day are switching suppliers since the introduction of
competition in the domestic gas market two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Some 3.5 million homes, or about 19 percent of the domestic
market, have either switched or agreed to switch suppliers,
according to figures released Saturday by Ofgas, the industry
regulator.
</P>
<P>
People were switching because alternative suppliers were
offering savings of up to 70 pounds (112 U.S. dollars) a year on
the average bill, said Clare Spottiswoode, director general of
Ofgas.
</P>
<P>
The large number of people moving suppliers showed that
"Britain has the biggest most competitive gas market in the
world," the regulator said.
</P>
<P>
Some 13 million homes, about three quarters of all domestic
customers, were now able to move to a new supplier, it added.
</P>
<P>
The final phase of domestic competition will be triggered next
month when 5.2 million customers in London and East Anglia will be
able to choose another gas supplier, according to Ofgas.

<HEADLINE> Syria Reiterates Opposition to Israeli Conditional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Syrian First Vice President
Abdul-Halim Khaddam Saturday reiterated Damascus' rejection to the
Israeli offer of conditional withdrawal from south Lebanon,
terming its as "a violation" of U.N. Resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
Speaking upon his arrival here Saturday afternoon for a visit,
Khaddam said that through the plan, Israel is trying to get out of
the dilemma it has created by its aggressive and expansionist
policies, the Iranian official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet decided on April 1 to accept the resolution
which called for unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south
Lebanon, but demands negotiated security arrangements by the
Lebanese government that would protect its northern towns from
Lebanese guerrilla cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Khaddam said that the conditions set forth by Israel for
implementation of the resolution violate the resolution.
</P>
<P>
On the Israeli-Palestinian peace track, he termed as "corrupt"
the forthcoming separate talks between the U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu in London on May 4.
</P>
<P>
"Such negotiations can only benefit the aggressor," he said.
</P>
<P>
Receiving his Syrian counterpart at the airport, Iranian First
Vice President Hassan Habibi also voiced Tehran's opposition to
the Israeli offer of conditional withdrawal from Lebanon, saying
that "such conditions are not reasonable and certainly not
supported by Iran."
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated Iran's objection to the Turkish military
cooperation with Israel, adding that the issue would be discussed
in meetings between officials of Iran and Syria during Khaddam's
stay here.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Israel have signed two military cooperation
agreements, arousing criticism from Arab countries who fear that
Turkey is allying itself against Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Referring to bilateral relations, Habibi said that regular
meetings of Iranian-Syrian joint committee are indicative of the
two countries' resolve to consult on various issues.
</P>
<P>
Besides holding talks with Iranian leaders and officials,
Khaddam will also take part in meetings of the joint committee,
which meets every six months in either of the two capitals.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti will hold an
international conference next month to discuss ways enabling over
87,000 qualified but unemployed Kuwaiti women to work from home.
</P>
<P>
Women's Committee of the Social Reform Society Chairwoman Saud
Al-Jarallah told reporters here Saturday that the meeting due to be
held from May 4 to 6 will discuss bringing new ideas like an
"office at home" to Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
"This will open up opportunities for women to work from home in
about 46 occupations," she added.
</P>
<P>
Al-Jarallah said that during the last two years, over 4,300
working women, including 1,600 university graduates, were forced
to retire from different jobs because of social commitments.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will host specialists from Malaysia, Sweden,
Britain and many Arab and African countries, Al-Jarallah said.
</P>
<P>
According to latest official statistics, only 60,000 women out
of 147,115 women in Kuwait who hold educational qualifications,
including 23,446 university graduates, have jobs.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, there are over 87,000 educated women,
including 2,367 university graduates, are not working due to
domestic and social commitments. Female population currently
account for 50.4 percent of the 710,000 citizens in the Gulf
state.
</P>
<P>
The conference will focus on the needs of the Kuwaiti labor
market with a view to absorbing women into it, Al-Jarallah said.
</P>
<P>
She said she believes the "office at home" system will enable
the women to have new access to the labor market.

LUSAKA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government is
disappointed with the mushrooming of substandard and unregistered
preschools and day care centers in the country, Lusaka Province
Minister Sony Mulenga said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Mulenga insisted that all the preschools and day care centers
owners must comply with the law because most centers are
operating contrary to the Nurseries Act.
</P>
<P>
When officiating the Zambia preschool annual general meeting
at the University of Zambia, Mulenga appealed to the preschool
owners to review their fees which he described as "unrealistic".
</P>
<P>
Currently, he said, only a few children can go to such schools
because of the unrealistic fees.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Preschool Association President Emmanuel Chisenga urged
the government to consider allocating them a place and a vehicle
to enable the association to reach out to all corners of the
country.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, professor Mutale Chanda, acting
vice-chancellor of the university, pledged continued support to
the Zambia Preschool Association.
</P>
<P>
Chanda said the university will soon introduce a degree
program in early childhood education because it acknowledges the
importance of early child education in the development of a
child.
</P>
<P>
The university has embarked on a number of workshops for
preschool proprietors and administrators to educate them on
various issues concerning early child education, said Chanda.

<P>
TEHRAN, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Leader of Afghan National Islamic
Movement (NIM) General Abdul Rashid Dostam arrived here Saturday
evening for discussions with Iranian leaders on Afghan situation.
</P>
<P>
Dostam, the top military commander in northern Afghanistan, is
expected to hold meetings with the Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi, special envoy in Afghan affairs Alaeddin Boroujerdi and
other Iranian officials.
</P>
<P>
He may also confer with Iranian President Mohammad Khatami,
according to the Iranian official news agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
Dostam's visit is considered as important since it came on the
threshold of the peace talks in Pakistan between the
representatives of the Afghan Taliban militia and the rival
Northern Alliance led by Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
Dostam, a former general of the Uzbek militia which supported
the former pro-Soviet government, turned to back Rabbani after the
Taliban forces drew his government out of the Afghan capital Kabul
in September 1996.
</P>
<P>
Following the recent visit of the U.S. ambassador to the
United Nations Bill Richardson to Afghanistan, both the Taliban
and the Northern Alliance agreed to hold peace talks to put an end
to the Afghan civil war since 1992 after the Muslims Jihad groups
ousted former pro-Soviet government.

The Russian official noted that his visits to Kampala and
Khartoum are part of Russian mediation efforts to solve the

<HEADLINE> Low Turnout Marks Nigeria's Parliament Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's national assembly
election Saturday was marked by a very low turnout, amid a calm
and peaceful atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
At several polling stations in Lagos State where Xinhua
correspondents visited, it is estimated that less than 20 percent
of the registered voters had cast their votes by 2:30 P.M., half
an hour before the end of the polls.
</P>
<P>
In a polling station on the Ikoyi Island where about 300
voters were registered, only less than 20 votes were seen in the
transparent ballot by the closure time.
</P>
<P>
The vote started around 8:00 a.m. at about 1,114 polling
stations nationwide and ended at around 3:00 p.m.. There is no
reports of violence so far.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's election are expected to produce 109 senators and
360 members of the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
The national assembly election is a major part of the
transition to civil rule in accordance with a civil rule program
announced in 1995 by the military government of General Sani
Abacha.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the Grassroots Democratic Movement (GDM)
joined Nigeria's four other political parties to adopt General
Abacha as their sole candidate for the presidential elections
scheduled for August 1.
</P>
<P>
Many Nigerians have expressed their disappointment over the
parties and, indeed, to the transition program, while opposition
groups have called for a boycott of Saturday's election and all
subsequent elections under the transition program.
</P>
<P>
At a polling station on the Lagos Island, a GDM agent
monitoring the election said many people simply chose to stay
home even if the persons of parties and electoral agencies were
going from house to house trying to peruade them to come out and
vote.

<HEADLINE> EU Pledges Continued Support for Zambian Artists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) pledged
here Saturday to continue supporting Zambian artists to exploit
their full potential so that they can compete favorably with
their counterparts across the world.
</P>
<P>
Charles Brook, EU representative in Zambia, said at an
exhibition of paintings and sculpture to mark
the Europe Day, which falls Saturday, that there are so many
Zambians talented in the arts who need support.
</P>
<P>
Brook said over the years EU has spent over 1.8 billion Kwacha
(about one million U.S. Dollars) to promote the arts of Zambia
and it will continue to support arts-oriented programs
such as rock painting, sculpturing and existing museums in the
country.
</P>
<P>
EU will continue to support the expansion of the Livingstone
and Lusaka national museums which have very important
collections, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mumba Kapumpa, Chairman of the Zambia Arts Council, bemoaned
the lack of interest by Zambians in promoting the arts.
</P>
<P>
"We need more and more Zambians to appreciate arts. I am sad
to see that the people patronizing the exhibition are foreigners
but there are very few Zambians. It should be the other way
round," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kapumpa called on the government to support the arts by
waiving import duty on tools of trade such as brushes and paint
so that many talented people can buy the tools and contribute to
the trade in the country.

<HEADLINE> Ross, Netanyahu Discuss Size of Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 25 (Xinhua) -- United States peace envoy
Dennis Ross began his new shuttle mission here late Saturday with
discussions with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the
second Israeli redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Ross, accompanied by Assistant Secretary of State for Near
Eastern Affairs and former U.S. Ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk,
held the meeting with Netanyahu at the Prime Minister's Office
shortly after his arrival here.
</P>
<P>
No details were disclosed about the meeting, but top on Ross'
agenda was to persuade Netanyahu to accept the U.S. proposal for a
13.1 percent Israeli redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Ross' latest mission is aimed at breaking the year-old
deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process by defining the
size of the second redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
As Netanyahu and Ross were talking, dozens of activists from
the peace movement Peace Now held a protest outside the Prime
Minister's Office to protest against Netanyahu's policy, saying it
is destroying the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Several protesters held a huge cartoon which depicted Netanyahu
as strangling with his hands a pigeon, the symbol of peace.
</P>
<P>
Trying to solve the dispute over the size of Israeli further
redeployment, Ross will set the stage for the four-way talks in
London to be co-hosted on May 4 by British Prime Minister Tony
Blair and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. The London
talks were the result of Blair's visit to the region earlier this
week.
</P>
<P>
Before departing for the region, Ross met in New York with
United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan to hold consultation
on the new U.S. initiative.
</P>
<P>
After meeting Netanyahu, Ross is to hold talks with
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat, who
said in Gaza Saturday that he hoped the Americans to push Israel
to accept the U.S. initiative. As a compromise, the PNA has
already endorsed the U.S. proposal for a 13.1 percent
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
However, even before Ross began his mission here, the
U.S. downplayed expectation for a dramatic breakthrough from Ross'
new round of diplomatic efforts.
</P>
<P>
State Department Spokesman James Rubin said Friday that it was
hard to be optimistic about the latest U.S. mediation because
there was no reason to know that Ross' mission would yield
anything but the kind of refusal to make hard decisions as seen in
the past.
</P>
<P>
In an earlier report Saturday, the state-run Israel Radio
quoted Israeli officials as saying that Netanyahu would refuse
again to accept the U.S. proposal because his Cabinet had
rejected any redeployment more than 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
But some other reports have said that Netanyahu might accept a
redeployment of 11 percent in order to pressure the Palestinian
side to intensify its fight against terrorism and enter the
long-overdue final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is to convene on Sunday a meeting of the Inner
Cabinet to discuss Ross' mission and coordinate Israel's
position. Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, National
Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon and Industry and Trade
Minister Natan Sharansky will attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said the inner cabinet was to deliberate a
demand for creating an American-Israeli-Palestinian committee to
decide on the size of the second redeployment and its effects
on the final-status talks, as well as the time table for the
PNA to implement its security promises.

<P>
PARIS, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Spain's Carlos Moya on Sunday beat
Frenchman Cedric Pioline in straight sets to win the 2.2 million
U.S. dollar Monte Carlo Open.
</P>
<P>
Moya, 1997 Australian Open losing finalist, won the one-sided
match 6-3, 6-0, 7-5 in just under two hours.
</P>
<P>
The seeded 14th had an impressive week in Monte Carlo with wins
over Austrian Thomas Muster and former Wimbledon champion Richard
Krajicek.
</P>
<P>
His final against Pioline was arguably his easiest contest,
even if the Frenchman fought hard in the third set.
</P>
<P>
Pioline looked exhausted after his tense semifinal against
another Spaniard, Alberto Berasategui, in which he saved two match
points before fighting his way back from 6-4, 0-6, 1-5 down to win.
</P>
<P>
The Frenchman may also have suffered again from his finals jinx
-- he has now lost 12 of the 14 finals he has played, including
Wimbledon last year and the U.S. Open in 1993.

BAGHDAD -- Iraq said on Sunday that a Russian proposal at the
United Nations to end inspections of suspected Iraqi nuclear sites
fell far short of what Iraq deserved.
</P>
<P>
Humam Abdul Khaliq, minister of information and culture, was
quoted by the official Iraqi News Agency as saying that the
Russian-suggested change from inspections to a monitoring phase
"does not represent Iraq's minimal due."
</P>
<P>
The Russian proposal "addresses a partial situation," and "if
this is all the U.N. Security Council's April discussions would
lead to," it does not meet Iraq's expectations, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Last week Russia floated a draft resolution calling for an end
to inspections of Iraq's suspected nuclear sites because there was
no proof that Iraq is still working on nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Khaliq said this resolution "would serve the American tactics
intended to derail the course of discussions from their core and
gain time to prolong the sanctions."
</P>
<P>
He claimed that all proscribed weapons under U.N. resolution
687, and their related facilities and equipment, have been
dismantled since late 1991. (Iraq-Russian Proposal)

ISLAMABAD -- Afghanistan's Islamic Taliban and the rival

Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The two sides decided to work very hard to finish their work
within three consecutive days if possible but not later than five
days," said James Ngobi, Head of the U.N. Special Mission on
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Ngobi said the Joint Steering Committee, which is made up of
five Taliban and nine alliance delegates, spent their first
session discussing the procedures and reached agreement on a
number of procedures.
</P>
<P>
The two sides were now engaged in working on the provisional
agenda, he said.

<P>
The U.N. official, who is presiding over the intra-Afghan
talks, said the Taliban and the alliance agreed that the United
Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC)
should be designated as the co-chairmen of the meeting.

TEHRAN -- A high ranking agent of the British Intelligence
Service (MI6) has been arrested in Iran under charges of illegally
filming military areas.
</P>
<P>
Robert Gavin was detained in Iran's western province of
Kurdistan while taking pictures and shooting films of military
establishments, Iran's morning daily Jomhuri Islami Sunday quoted
an informed source as saying.
</P>
<P>
The unnamed source said that Gavin, holding a tourist visa,
entered the military areas without any permission as a reporter of
the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).
</P>
<P>
The MI6 agent has been in detention for a week for questioning
and he has confessed to his spying activities in Iran and several
Arab countries, the source said. However, no Iranian authorities
have confirmed the arrest.
</P>
<P>
Some Arab diplomats and reporters here described Gavin's
activities as "suspicious," saying that BBC has screened several
films made by the Briton from prohibited and sensitive military
areas in Arab countries. (Iran-UK-Spy)

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Speaker: Israel Must Implement Third </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Israel must carry out its third
phase troop redeployment in the West Bank under the signed
Oslo Accords, Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC)
Abu Ala said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Abu Ala told 12 representatives from the European Union to
the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) at the PNA Education
Ministry in Ramallah that Israeli troop redeployment was
stipulated in the Oslo Accords and Israel had to implement it.
</P>
<P>
Abu Ala's remarks were apparently PNA's response to Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's statement Saturday that
he would tell U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross that unless the size
of a third redeployment is set, Israel would not agree to a
second redeployment.
</P>
<P>
In the U.S.-brokered Hebron agreement in January 1997,
Netanyahu promised to redeploy its troops in the West Bank in
three stages by this summer.
</P>
<P>
Israel has also said that it would not accept the second stage
troop redeployment in the West Bank until the PNA agreed to move
onto the final-status peace talks.
</P>
<P>
According to accords between Israel and Palestine, the two
sides will settle the thorniest issues of Jerusalem, final borders
and Palestinian refugees in the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank is one of the key
issues that hinders the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
U.S. has raised an initiative, which is under discussion
between Netanyahu and Ross, asking Israel to hand over a further
13.1 percent of the West Bank to the PNA over 12 weeks.
</P>
<P>
Israel has refused to accept the initiative though it has
soften its position and is willing to offer a pullback of 11
percent up from the earlier limit of 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Ross arrived here Saturday to conduct his current shuttle
diplomacy between Israel and the PNA. He started his second round
of talks here Sunday afternoon with Netanyahu and was scheduled
to meet PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat late in the evening.
</P>
<P>
Ross's main mission this time is to lay the ground work for the
London talks, which are aimed at ending the current crisis over
Israeli troop redeployment.
</P>
<P>
As arranged by British Prime Minister Tony Blair, U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will meet separately in
London on May 4 with Arafat and Netanyahu.

<HEADLINE> Somali Clan Fighting Kills 40 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 26 (Xinhua) -- After six relatively good
years, a major clan animosity seems to be reigniting once again
among the two large communities of Darod and Hawiye.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of hostility emerged after the two sub-clans
of Majerten and Marehan had re-energized their fight for control
of the Southern port town of Kismayu in the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
A large offensive campaign launched by the Majerten sub-clan
against the Marehan militiamen outside Kismayu has resulted in
killing more than 40 people and wounded over 60 others in the
past three days.
</P>
<P>
Also in this period, the Majerten militiamen have gained
control of more than 100 km territory covering the villages of
Gobwein, Yontoy, Bulo Gudud and others earlier controlled by
Marehan militiamen.
</P>
<P>
According to reports received here through the VHF radios, the
fighting was in its highest peak Saturday after the Marehan
militiamen were driven back toward the defensive positions of the
Hawiye militiamen near Kansuma village which is where the equator
passes through in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
During the fighting, the Majerten militiamen led by the
son-in-law of Somalia's late dictator, General Mohamed Said Hirsi
Morgan, have also captured 20 prisoners who were all taken back
to the town of Kismayu, 500 Km South of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The fighting has then spread to territories controlled by
Hussein Aidid's faction in Lower Jubba region.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the captured prisoners also include
four militiamen from the Habar Gidir clan of Hussein Mohamed
Aidid at a militia base a few kilometers away from Yontoy
village.
</P>
<P>
These Habar Gidir men include the commander and two of his
assistants of one of those small militia bases.
</P>
<P>
Ever since, the fighting has seemed to be changing its
direction and sense.
</P>
<P>
The hostility between the two Darod sub-clans of Majerten and
Marehan is now taking a new shape escalating to include Hawiye
and Darod tribes unless something is done as soon as possible.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foregin Minister Amr
Moussa will visit Gaza on Tuesday to discuss with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat ways of promoting the Palestinian-Israeli
peace talks, the Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Moussa is to arrive in Gaza after taking part in the talks
between Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has invited Netanyahu to visit Cairo next Tuesday for
talks on the stalled Middle East peace process
</P>
<P>
Moussa is expected to brief Arafat, president of the
Palestinian National Authority, on the results of the talks, MENA
said.
</P>
<P>
He will also discuss with Arafat the outcome of the ongoing
tour of United States Mideast envoy Dennis Ross and the planned
meeting on May 4 in London attended by Arafat, Netanyahu and
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
In his recent regional tour, British Prime Minister Tony Blair
proposed to hold the meeting, which is aimed at breaking the
deadlock in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israel peace talks came to a standstill in
March, 1997 when Israel broke ground for the construction of a
Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians
want as the capital of their future independent state.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day trip, Moussa will also attend meetings of
the Higher Egyptian-Palestinian Joint Committee, during which the
two sides will sign several cooperation agreements in the fields
of economy, trade, education, transportation and health.
</P>
<P>
He is to address the Palestinian Council at its temporary
headquarters in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
After a second round of talks with Arafat on Wednesday, Moussa
will leave for the Palestinian town of Rafah to lay the foundation
stone for a memorial in honor of the Egyptian soldiers fighting
for the Palestinian cause.

<HEADLINE> OAPEC Official Pessimistic About Oil Price Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 26 (Xinhua) -- A chief Arab oil official
expressed Sunday pessimism about quick oil price recovery in
the world market though he said some measures to balance the
world oil market could be taken.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing that might be considered a major solution,
but we can agree on some measures that would balance the
international oil markets," Kuwait News Agency quoted
Secretary-General of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OAPEC) Abdul Aziz Al-Turki as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said there was growing concern that oil prices would
continue to dip, saying that the average price of Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) oil basket has dropped to
11.20 dollars per barrel late last month compared with 19.5
dollars per barrel last October.
</P>
<P>
"The price drop reflects the imbalance in international oil
markets during recent months when the markets were supplied with
oil surpassing its capacities," Turki said.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and non-OPEC Mexico clinched a pact in
Riyadh last month with the aim of lowering world oil production by
1.6 million barrels per day to 2 million barrels per day to
bolster oil prices.
</P>
<P>
OPEC ministers also agreed at an emergency session last month to
contribute a cut of 1.245 million barrels per day to the Riyadh
pact, its first output cut in a decade.
</P>
<P>
However, the cuts failed to bring back the price mainly because
of oversupply, declining demand in Asia in the wake of the
region's financial crisis, increased oil supply from Iraq under
the U.N. oil-for-food deal and warmer weather in the northern
hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
Oil officials from the Gulf oil producing countries have held
talks recently on further possible output cut.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia's Oil Minister Ali Naimi said recently that the
OPEC would consider further cuts if necessary at its June 24
meeting in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
OPEC President and Petroleum and Mineral Resources Minister of
the United Arab Emirates Obeid Bin Saif Al-Nasir also said that
"if the oil price stays where it is now there will be a lot of
talks about further cuts and we don't rule out any possibility."

FUZHOU, April 26 (Xinhua) -- East China's Fujian Province,
which has already formed a basic coastal shelterbelt, is expected to

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Organization Advises Government on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' largest organization of
employers said on Sunday the harmonization process with the
European Union (EU) must be carried out with care to avoid
negative effects on the island's economy.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of
Cyprus said that this was the basic conclusion of a study it has
conducted on the consequences of the harmonization process.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, which will be submitted to the Cypriot
government, Cyprus should seek financial aid from the EU to
support its productive sectors, which will be open to competition
from their European counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, along with five East European countries, began
accession talks with the EU last month and the harmonization
process with the organization is underway.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the liberalization of Cyprus' financial system,
the Cypriot chamber pointed out that it should not affect the
business activities on the island.
</P>
<P>
As for the free movement of labour stipulated in EU's laws, it
said employment and the social structure of Cyprus' labour force
must be taken into consideration.
</P>
<P>
It expressed fear that Cyprus would have to pay a social cost
if flooded with European job seekers.
</P>
<P>
The chamber called on the government to protect the island's
lucrative offshore sector through seeking a special status in the
entry talks with the EU in a bid to preserve the booming offshore
companies.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: Warring Afghan Factions Sit Around </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 26 (Xinhua) -- As a result of hectic
diplomatic efforts by the international community, the two warring
Afghan factions, the Taliban militia and the rival Northern
Alliance, sat around the negotiating table at last.
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited talks between the two Afghan warring factions
opened here Sunday morning with both sides expressing optimism
about peace in their war-ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
It is the first face-to-face meeting between the two sides
since January last year. The meeting of the Joint Steering
Committee, which is made up of five delegates from the Taliban and
nine from the Northern Alliance, is jointly sponsored by the U.N.
and the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC).
</P>
<P>
Soon after the ceremonial session which is open to the media,
the two Afghan factions entered into their first formal session
working on the provisional agenda.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban and the Northern Alliance have agreed to end their
current peace talks in Islamabad in three to five days. "The two
sides decided to work very hard to finish their work within three
consecutive days if possible but not later than five days," said
James Ngobi, acting head of the U.N. Special Mission on
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
During their first round of talks, the two sides reached a
five-point agreement on how they will proceed to resolve their
differences for seeking an ultimate objective of establishing
peace in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The agreed points include: the U.N. and OIC will be co-chairmen
of the meeting to preside over and conduct the working sessions;
Pashto and Dari (Persian) will be two official languages for the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
It also includes that decisions of the meeting will be taken
with consensus, not by voting, and if there is lack of consensus
on any matter under discussion, it would be referred to their
respective leadership, or to be postponed till the next meeting of
the Steering Committee.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, in the ceremonial session chaired by Pakistani Foreign
Minister Gohar Ayub Khan, head of the Taliban delegation Abdul
Wakeel said that only the proposed Ulema (religious scholars)
Commission would be able to resolve all the Afghan issues.
</P>
<P>
Wakeel said the Taliban hoped negotiations with the Northern
Alliance will yield "positive results." However, he added that if
the Ulema Commission is not recognized, "any negotiations will be
symbolic."
</P>
<P>
A written statement by the supreme Taliban leader, Mohammad
Umar, also said the Islamic militia "have suggested the Islamic
decision by Ulema, we reaffirm the same and do not want any other
formula, because we consider the decision of Ulema as sufficient
for solving all the problems."
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the Taliban and the Northern Alliance still
have major differences on the formula or the agenda of the Joint
Steering Committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremonial meeting, head of the Northern
Alliance delegation Fazal Hadi Shinwari said they appreciated the
efforts by the international community for bringing together "the
two brothers" to a face-to-face meeting.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the neighboring countries,
especially Pakistan, will continue to support Afghanistan's peace
process for an eventual solution of the Afghan problem.
</P>
<P>
"We are asking the neighboring countries, the U.N., as well as
OIC to make their best efforts so we could reach a conclusion
after 20 years of war," said Shinwari.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Foreign Minister Ayub Khan, acting head of the U.N.
Special Mission on Afghanistan Ngobi and OIC Assistant Secretary
General Ibrahim Saleh Bakar also spoke at the ceremonial meeting.
</P>
<P>
They welcomed the resumption of the intra-Afghan talks, saying
that it is a positive development towards the desired restoration
of peace in Afghanistan and hoping the meeting will yield positive
results.
</P>
<P>
The ceremonial meeting was also attended by diplomatic
representatives from the six neighboring countries of Afghanistan
as well as from Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The second working session between the Taliban and the Northern
Alliance is still in process.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Rejects Russian Proposal, Demands Lifting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Iraq said on Sunday that a
Russian proposal at the United Nations to end inspections of
suspected Iraqi nuclear sites fell far short of what Iraq deserved.
</P>
<P>
Humam Abdul Khaliq, minister of information and culture, was
quoted by the official Iraqi News Agency as saying that the
Russian-suggested change from inspections to a monitoring phase
"does not represent Iraq's minimal due."
</P>
<P>
The Russian proposal "addresses a partial situation," and "if
this is all the U.N. Security Council's April discussions would
lead to," it does not meet Iraq's expectations, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Last week Russia floated a draft resolution calling for an end
to inspections of Iraq's suspected nuclear sites because there was
no proof that Iraq is still working on nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Khaliq said this resolution "would serve the American tactics
intended to derail the course of discussions from their core and
gain time to prolong the sanctions."
</P>
<P>
He claimed that all proscribed weapons under U.N. resolution
687, and their related facilities and equipment, have been
dismantled since late 1991.
</P>
<P>
The inspections of Iraq's presidential compounds, brokered by
U.N. chief Kofi Annan in February to end a crisis over weapons
inspections between Iraq and the U.N., have come up with nothing
of prohibited weapons.
</P>
<P>
Hence, he said, the U.N. sanctions, already seven years old,
were expected to have been lifted long time ago.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Iraq still hoped the Security Council's
bi-annual review of the sanctions regime, scheduled to start on
Monday, might lead to the removal of sanctions. "Iraq is waiting
for this result in sincere recognition of its dear sacrifices," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Richard Butler, the chief U.N. arms inspector, however, said in
a recent report to the United Nations that his Special Commission
on disarming Iraq had made "virtually no progress" over the past
six months in determining if Iraq is clean of banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
"If the world and fair-minded people would like to see the
relationship between Iraq and the Security Council and its Special
Commission resting on a basis of fairness," Khaliq said, the
subject of sanctions should be tackled in all sincerity toward
their immediate lifting.
</P>
<P>
"A mere approval of the Russian proposal shall not bend Iraq's
will of determination to do what is right," he added.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the statements made by Iraq's Revolution
Command Council and cabinet should be taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
The statements demand immediate implementation of paragraph 22
of the U.N. resolution 687, which provides for easing of sanctions
once Iraq's nuclear, chemical, biological weapons and ballistic
missiles have been scrapped and steps taken to ensure they can not
be rebuilt.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Holds First Smoke Combating Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Minister of Health
Adel Al-Subeih Sunday warned dangerous consequences of smoking
especially among the youngsters in the Gulf state while
inaugurating a regional anti-smoking conference here.
</P>
<P>
The conference, first of its kind in Kuwait, was organized by
Kuwaiti Society for the Prevention of Smoking and Cancer in
cooperation with the Kuwait Foundation for the Advancement of
Sciences and the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day conference, smoking combating experts from
Saudi Arabia, Oman and Kuwait will present papers on means and
experiences in fighting the health harming habit.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait is one of the largest cigarette consuming country in
the Middle East region and smoking habit is quickly finding its
way among the school students.
</P>
<P>
Al-Subeih said in his inaugural speech that 50 percent of
deaths in Kuwait Pectoral Hospital occurred as a result of lung
cancer diseases, of which smoking is a main factor.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that the majority of heart patients under
40 years of age in Kuwait are smokers. Patients who are smokers
cost his ministry triple treatment than the non-smokers in the
country, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also reviewed Kuwaiti government's efforts in combating
smoking through the forbidding of smoking advertising in the
official media sources and public places, limiting the maximum
nicotine and tar percentage, increasing the customs tax on
cigarettes and printing the health-warning on the cigarette
packs.

<HEADLINE> Law to Help Deter Youth Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislature today
deliberated a draft law on the prevention of juvenile delinquency,
the first of its kind in the country's history.
</P>
<P>
Hou Zongbin, chairman of the Committee for Internal and
Judicial Affairs of the National People's Congress (NPC), said
that the aim of the law is to create a social environment which is
conducive to the healthy growth of youngsters.
</P>
<P>
The draft law underlines the guardianship and educational
responsibilities of families and schools. It also makes clear the
responsibilities of relevant government departments as regards
cultural affairs which affect young people.
</P>
<P>
The draft law stipulates that aid should be offered to
disadvantaged children, such as those with divorced parents or
problems attending school.
</P>
<P>
Guo Xiang, a professor at the China University of Political
Science and Law, said that most youngsters aged 17 to 22 who break
the law have little knowledge of the law. "Therefore, priority
should be given to prevention," he said.
</P>
<P>
The first peak period of teenage crimes in New China came about
during the "cultural revolution" (1966-1976), Guo noted, and "the
second peak came in the late 1980s."
</P>
<P>
He warned that in the near future crimes specifically related
to only-children will be emerge as a new problem.
</P>
<P>
The draft law deliberated today at the second meeting of the
NPC's Standing Committee applies to youngsters between the ages of
14 and 18.
</P>
<P>
The average age of criminals has been decreasing since the 1970s,
and teenage crimes have become a factor affecting social stability.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of teenage criminals to other youngsters in the same
age group doubled during the 1986-1995 period.

<HEADLINE> Officials Discuss Yellow River Anti-Flood Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, April 26 (Xinhua) -- A group of officials and
experts from Shanxi, Shaanxi, Henan and Shandong provinces
gathered here April 24-26 to discuss anti-flood work on the Yellow
River.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held by the Yellow River Anti-Flood
Headquarters, which is based in this capital of Henan.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River, the second-largest in China, was prone to
endemic flooding and the accompanying property and human losses
before the founding of New China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
In the past 48 years the river has not caused any major
disasters or losses, thanks to the efforts of local people and
governments at all levels.
</P>
<P>
The participants at the meeting urged people to be on their
guard for possible severe floods this year, because ``the
anti-flooding facilities along the river are aging and eroded''.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that projects to repair or rebuild the dikes and
dams, especially in dangerous sections, must be completed on time
before the flood season comes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, efforts must be made to accomplish forecasts of
water levels at seven leading hydrometric stations on the lower
reaches of the river, and for the working out of plans for
evacuation in case of floods, as well as other related matters,
according to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The participants also discussed flood-prevention measures
for the Xiaolangdi Hydropower Project that is being built near
Luoyang City, Henan.

<HEADLINE> China's Exports Remain Brisk in Major Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The demand for Chinese
commodities remains strong in China's major overseas markets,
despite the negative impact on the country's exports caused by the
Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
This was proved by the fact that China's exports to regions
outside Asia increased by over 17 percent in the first three
months of this year.
</P>
<P>
This can also be seen here at the ongoing 83rd China Import and
Export Commodities Fair.
</P>
<P>
Business people from China's conventional export markets, such
as the countries of the European Union and North America, as well
as Japan, and Hong Kong and Macao, have been active in purchasing
at the fair, making up around 70 percent of the business people
attending the fair.
</P>
<P>
Craig Fleming, a sales manager from Roman Bank House of
Britain, said that he would buy more Chinese-made paper flowers at
the fair, at least no less than the company bought last year.
</P>
<P>
So far at the 16-day fair, launched April 15, China has signed
deals for exports of machinery and electrical products topping 1.5
billion US dollars-worth.
</P>
<P>
Business people from the United States, the European Union,
Japan, Hong Kong and Macao have ordered Chinese commodities worth
nearly 600 million US dollars, up 12 percentage points over the
figure for the previous fair.
</P>
<P>
However, China's business volume with Southeast Asian countries
declined by some 70 percent at the fair.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China has signed export contracts at the fair for
light industrial and arts and crafts products exceeding one
billion US dollars-worth, mainly with the United States, Hong
Kong, the EU countries and Japan, representing an increase of more
than 14 percent over the same period of the previous fair.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami on Sunday urged the Islamic countries to be united, rally
around their common interests and promote understanding among
themselves in order to face the Israeli challenges.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with visiting Syrian First Vice President
Abdul-Halim Khaddam, Khatami also called for further promotion of
cooperation among Islamic countries within the framework of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) and the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
According to the Iranian official news agency IRNA, Khaddam
handed Khatami a letter from Syrian President Hafez al-Assad,
who invited his Iranian counterpart to visit Damascus. However, no
detailed content of the letter was revealed.
</P>
<P>
Khaddam also briefed the Iranian president on the latest
regional developments and the recent Israeli plan of conditional
withdrawal from south Lebanon. He called on Muslim countries to
join hands in solving problems facing the world of Islam.
</P>
<P>
Israel decided on April 1 to accept the U.N. Resolution 425,
which calls for an unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south
Lebanon. But meanwhile, Israel said it would not exit unless
security arrangements for its northern border areas are worked out
with the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
Khaddam arrived here Saturday afternoon and held two rounds of
talks with his Iranian counterpart Hassan Habibi. He concluded
his visit to Iran and left here for Damascus Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure, Khaddam said that he is satisfied with
his visit to Tehran, adding that during the meetings held between
the two countries' officials, Iran and Syria shared common
viewpoints on different issues which will be announced in a joint
communique later on.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the critical situation in Iraq, he noted that
Syria underlines the need to maintain territorial integrity of
Iraq and is opposed to any military action against it.
</P>
<P>
Habibi, seeing Khaddam off at the airport, called for
implementation of the U.N. Resolution 425, saying that Iran
supports the stance of Syria and Lebanon that rejects any
condition for withdrawal of the Israeli forces from south
Lebanon.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- China will give priority to
developing large hydropower generating equipment, in a bid to meet
its demand for generating sets with a total capacity of five
million kw in the coming five years.
</P>
<P>
According to a source at the China State Power Corporation
(CSPC), the country will develop large pumping and
energy-conserving generating units in the coming five years, which
are designed to serve the Three Gorges power project as well as
other large hydropower projects.
</P>
<P>
The source said China is planning to enhance its production
capacity of large hydropower generating equipment from the current
two million kw to five million kw in the early years of the next
century.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China will develop the capability to produce four
extra-large generating units, each with a capacity of 700,000 kw.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior CSPC official, China has set the target
of an annual electricity output of 1.4 trillion kwh and enhancing
its installed power-generating capacity to 300 million kw by the
end of this century.
</P>
<P>
The CSPC source noted that China will first exploit the

<HEADLINE> Asian Development Needs More Technical Aid: ADB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Asia's developing countries need
more technical assistance to manage and initiate structural reform
programs and strategies which can meet challenges of a different
nature and magnitude, the Asian Development Bank (finance) said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Asian nations have traditionally called for foreign assistance
to finance physical projects such as irrigation systems and roads,
but changes in their economic environments have led them to also
seek more technical assistance, which is designed to help physical
projects work," said the Manila-based bank in its annual report
for 1997, which was released here.
</P>
<P>
As a major provider of technical assistance in the Asian and
Pacific region, the bank provided 162.5 million U.S. dollars in
technical aid to finance 298 projects in its member economies in
1997, compared to 41.9 million dollars for 135 projects the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
The ADB, which provides both financing of projects and
technical assistance, said the role of technical assistance has
been increasing and will continue to grow, given changes in
development environments.
</P>
<P>
The bank said its technical aid is aimed at assisting its
developing members in identifying, formulating and implementing
projects; improving their institutional capabilities and
formulating development strategies; promoting technology transfer,
and fostering regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the bank's technical assistance included a project in
China to promote energy-saving construction materials, and a
project in India to promote public finance reforms, and the
establishment of a tender support bureau in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The bank said many developing countries in Asia need to enhance
their capacity to manage and initiate development and economic
policies as they switch to market-oriented, outward-looking
economic management strategies and undertake policy and regulatory
reforms.
</P>
<P>
Many of the region's centrally planned economies are also in
transition towards a market economy, and technical assistance is
needed to help them create and develop a set of institutions for a
market economy, it said.
</P>
<P>
"To assist developing member economies effectively in this
changing environment, the bank cannot help but make its services
further broad-based," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
"Technical assistance has become a key strategic tool for
development assistance," it said.
</P>
<P>
The ADB's technical assistance operations are financed through
grants or loans, or a combination of both. Grants are funded by
the bank's Technical Assistance Special Fund based on voluntary
contribution from its members, and the Japan Special Fund, a
united contribution from the Japanese government.

<HEADLINE> ADB Optimistic About Prospects of Asian Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Despite the current financial
crisis in Asia, the longer-term outlook for the Asian economy "is
far from bleak," the Asian Development Bank (ADB) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Human capacities have not been destroyed, social and physical
infrastructure remain largely intact, and there has been a
strengthening of policies and institutional structures that
promote openness and macro-economic stability," the bank said in
its annual report for 1997 which was released here.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the capacity for resources mobilization,
reasonably good infrastructure, favorable demographics, an open
trading system and a general commitment to macro-economic prudence
-- all these factors should stimulate growth.
</P>
<P>
"In time, structural weakness in financial systems can and will
be rectified, more efficient capital markets will evolve and
foreign capital will return," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
"Economic growth will resume once appropriate adjustment
policies are implemented and take effect," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
However, the bank admitted that fast growth in Asia is unlikely
to resume quickly as the necessary institutional response to the
crisis cannot be implemented overnight.
</P>
<P>
For some economies, it said, the road back may be "longer than
for others," but provided policy corrections are made and
institutional reforms carried through, the foundations which
propelled fast growth in the past should once again come to the
fore.
</P>
<P>
On the consequences of the crisis, the bank said that Asia's
economic progress was set back significantly by precipitous falls
in the values of currencies and stock markets that began in
mid-1997, it said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the repercussions of these disturbances are still
being felt through the region and beyond.
</P>
<P>
In its "Asian Development Outlook--1998" published last week,
the bank said the Asian crisis contributed to a further slowdown
in the growth rate to 6.1 percent in 1997 from 7.5 percent in 1996
and the growth pace is projected at about 4 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The bank said South Korea and most of Southeast Asia are now
undergoing wrenching macro-economic and sectoral adjustments, but
the implications for real economic activity, as opposed to the
financial sector, are only gradually being revealed.
</P>
<P>
"The social consequences of the crisis are likely to be
serious," the bank warned.
</P>
<P>
It said many of those least able to protect themselves, such as
migrant workers, will be among those most severely affected.
</P>
<P>
The expectations of many of Asia's emerging middle classes have
also suffered, it added.
</P>
<P>
"Social safety nets, which are weak or poorly developed in many
places, are coming under increasing stress," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The bank promised that it will continue to assist its
developing members to address such difficulties.

<HEADLINE> ADB Responds Quickly to Asian Crisis, Says Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank said
Monday that it has monitored the Asian financial crisis closely
since it started in mid-1997 and determined appropriate response.
</P>
<P>
In its annual report for 1997, which was released here, the
bank said it liaised closely with its members, the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and bilateral donors to
develop its interventions in the 10-month old crisis.
</P>
<P>
"These efforts culminated in program loans to the Republic of
Korea (South Korea) and Thailand, and a pledge of assistance to
Indonesia," it said.
</P>
<P>
The loan to South Korea was the bank's first to the country
since 1988.
</P>
<P>
"These loans illustrated the bank's ability to respond rapidly
to the needs of the region," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
It said the financial sector loans to South Korea and Thailand
from the bank's ordinary capital resources boosted total ADB
lending for the year to 9.4 billion U.S. dollars, nearly 4 billion
dollars more than its lending in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, the financial sector received nearly 50 percent
of total lending," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
As the crisis deepened and broadened, the bank said, it
approved a 300 million dollar financial markets reform program
loan for Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The program was designed to strengthen market regulation and
supervision, improve risk management, facilitate investor access
to domestic financial markets and develop long-term institutional
sources of funds by promoting an integrated system of pension and
provident funds.
</P>
<P>
For South Korea, the bank said, it approved a 4
billion-U.S.-dollar program loan for financial sector reforms in
three major areas -- capacity building of banking and non-bank
financial institutions; building financial market infrastructure;
and improving corporate accounting and disclosure standards.
</P>
<P>
In Indonesia, according to the bank, it has been working on a
1.5 billion-U.S.-dollar capital market reform program to improve
the country's regulatory and supervisory functions, develop the
fixed income securities and financial derivatives markets and
strengthen the institutional capability of contractual savings
institutions.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, the bank is expected to become involved with
restructuring the banking system, focusing on private national
banks and regional development banks," it said.
</P>
<P>
The Manila-based bank is a multilateral development finance
institution, whose capital stock is owned by 56 members from the
Asia-Pacific region and outside the region. The bank is engaged in
promoting the economic and social progress of its developing
members.

<HEADLINE> Yemeni Parliament Speaker Optimistic on Improving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni Parliament Speaker
Sheikh Abdullah Bin Hussein Al-Ahmar has expressed optimism on
prospects of improving ties with Kuwait which became strained
since the 1991 Gulf War, the official Kuwait News Agency reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"There is sincere desire for cooperation for the benefit of
the two countries," Al-Ahmar said in Yemeni capital Sanaa in an
interview with the news agency.
</P>
<P>
"We look forward to a future marked with restoration of Arab
solidarity and this requires concessions from all of us," he was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti-Yemeni relations turned sour after the Gulf War
because Sanaa sided with Iraq during Iraqi seven month-occupation
of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait downgraded its diplomatic representation in Yemen to the
level of Charge D'Affaires in 1991 while Yemen closed its embassy
in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Prospects of improving bilateral ties have become brighter
since early last year when Kuwait officially declared the
intention to start a reconciliatory process with the Arab
countries that supported Iraq during the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
A Kuwaiti educational delegation visited Sanaa last July on
the first such mission after the ties were strained. Last month
Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh in what was seen as a good
will towards Kuwait said the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait caused
dissension among the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
During the interview, Al-Ahmar also said that his country backs
any effort that would lead to resolving the issue of Prisoners of
War (POWs) between Iraq and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The issue of POWs has been sensitive to the improvement of
relations between Kuwait and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait said that Baghdad still detains 625 Kuwaiti POWs in
Iraqi jails and has frequently urged Iraq to release them. But
Baghdad said those POWs were missing during turmoils in southern
Iraq following the Gulf War.

<HEADLINE> Senior British Spy Arrested in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 26 (Xinhua) -- A high ranking agent of the
British Intelligence Service (MI6) has been arrested in Iran under
charges of illegally filming military areas.
</P>
<P>
Robert Gavin was detained in Iran's western province of
Kurdistan while taking pictures and shooting films of military
establishments, Iran's morning daily Jomhuri Islami Sunday quoted
an informed source as saying.
</P>
<P>
The unnamed source said that Gavin, holding a tourist visa,
entered the military areas without any permission as a reporter of
the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).
</P>
<P>
The MI6 agent has been in detention for a week for questioning
and he has confessed to his spying activities in Iran and several
Arab countries, the source said. However, no Iranian authorities
have confirmed the arrest.
</P>
<P>
Some Arab diplomats and reporters here described Gavin's
activities as "suspicious," saying that BBC has screened several
films made by the Briton from prohibited and sensitive military
areas in Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
It was not known how he has managed to shoot the films, but an
Arab diplomat said it is likely that the British military attaches
in the Persian Gulf region filmed the establishments and passed
them on to Gavin.
</P>
<P>
One Arab diplomat, whose name was not given, also said that
Gavin had been willing to pay huge sums of money in return for
military information from Arab reporters, but the Arabs refrained
from cooperating with him.

LONDON, April 26 (Xinhua) - An explosion damaged a Catholic bar
and restaurant near Armagh city in Northern Ireland overnight but
there were no casualties, BBC TV reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The area around the bar was sealed off and families forced to
leave a number of nearby homes. The BBC quoted a police spokesman
as saying the cause of the blast was unknown.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman said that it was not a major explosion
and an Army bomb disposal team was sent to the scene.
</P>
<P>
In a separate incident Saturday, police arrested two men in
connection with the murder of a roman Catholic student.
</P>
<P>
The student, Ciaran Heffron, was the latest victim of sectarian
violence that persists in Northern Ireland despite a peace accord
was signed this month.
</P>
<P>
Heffron was killed only a day after two key Protestant
guerrilla groups announced their support for the April 10 peace
deal reached by eight main Protestant and Catholic political
parties and the British and Irish governments.

Sunday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Afghan Factions Agree to End Talks in 3-5 Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's Islamic Taliban
and the rival Northern Alliance have agreed to end their current
peace talks in Islamabad in three to five days, a senior U.N.
official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The two sides decided to work very hard to finish their work
within three consecutive days if possible but not later than five
days," said James Ngobi, Head of the U.N. Special Mission on
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Ngobi said the Joint Steering Committee, which is made up of
five Taliban and nine alliance delegates, spent their first
session discussing the procedures and reached agreement on a
number of procedures.
</P>
<P>
The two sides were now engaged in working on the provisional
agenda, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official, who is presiding over the intra-Afghan
talks, said the Taliban and the alliance agreed that the United
Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC)
should be designated as the co-chairmen of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed that the statement on the proceedings of each
session will be made only by the co-chairmen on behalf of the
committee after the text of the statement has been approved by the
committee as a whole, he said.
</P>
<P>
No other statement will be taken as the official one
representing the committee if it is not made by the co-chairmen,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the two sides agreed they will reach agreement by
consensus and not by voting, he said.
</P>
<P>
If there is lack of consensus on any matter under discussion,
that matter would either be referred to the respective leaderships
or would be postponed until a future meeting of the committee.
</P>
<P>
The on-going meeting between Taliban and the alliance, which
started here Sunday morning, is jointly sponsored by the U.N. and
the OIC. It is the first face-to-face encounter between the two
Afghan rivals in more than a year.

<HEADLINE> Iran: U.S. Should Look "More Humane" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami has said that it will be "wiser" for the United States to
change its outlooks and pursue "more humane approach" towards the
world, the official IRNA news agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Lambasting U.S. economic sanctions against Tehran, he told
visiting Japanese State Secretary for Foreign Affairs Masahiko
Komura Saturday that the U.S. can no longer dictate its volition
over the others.
</P>
<P>
Citing Iran as a successful case of breaking up U.S. isolation,
Khatami said his country is doing well through self-sufficiency
and has satisfactorily mended fences with neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has imposed various sanctions on Iran ever since the
beginning of the Islamic Revolution of Iran in 1979. Washington
broke off relations with Tehran after radical Iranian students
occupied the U.S. embassy and took the staffers hostage in 1980.
</P>
<P>
Issuing a warning apparently to the U.S., the president said
exertion of pressure and intimidation will only lead to violence
in the world.
</P>
<P>
World peace rests only with elimination of domineering policies
and promotion of respect for the rights of others and honor for
mankind, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. should transform its outlooks to the world including
Iran so that it can enter the 21st century with new perceptions in
the active international arena, Khatami added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Iran-Japan ties, Khatami told Komura that it
was an appropriate time for the expansion of bilateral cooperation
in all the possible economic, technical and technological spheres.
</P>
<P>
Komura said that Japan looks at Iran as a friend while
maintaining a cordial relation with the U.S.. He also expressed
hope that obstacles against re-establishing Tehran-Washington
relations will be removed.
</P>
<P>
Komura also handed over a message from Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto to Khatami. He left here Sunday morning after
wrapping up a four-day official visit.

ISLAMABAD, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The formation of a government
in Afghanistan is an internal affair of the Afghans and is no
concern of Pakistan's, a Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made the remarks in an interview with BBC in the
context of the talks between the Taliban militia and its rival
Northern Alliance which began in Islamabad Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan is striving for the establishment of peace and
a broad-based government in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Obviously the broad-based government in Afghanistan would
reflect the aspirations of the Afghan people, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman argued that although Pakistan has recognized "the
Taliban government," "the recognition does not mean that we want
to install a government of our own choice in Afghanistan."
</P>
<P>
"If this would have been the case, we would have kept silent
instead of making any efforts," he said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Reiterates Support for Syria, Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Iranian First Vice President
Hassan Habibi has reiterated Iran's support for the stance of
Syria and Lebanon demanding unconditional Israeli withdrawal from
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with visiting Syrian First Vice President
Abdul-Halim Khaddam on Saturday night, Habibi said that if the
idea of the Israeli offer is to implement the U.N. resolution 425,
there should be no strings attached, the Iranian official news
agency IRNA reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Cabinet formally approved the resolution on April 1
and offered to withdraw its troops from south Lebanon provided
negotiated security arrangement are agreed by the Lebanese
government.
</P>
<P>
Israel is occupying a 1,200-square kilometer security zone in
south Lebanon established with the aim to protect its northern
areas from Lebanese guerrilla cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and its ally Syria, which closely coordinate their
Mideast policies, firmly rejected the offer on the grounds that it
contradicted the resolution which calls for an unconditional
Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The two countries want the Israeli withdrawal unconditional and
simultaneous with an Israeli pullback from the Golan Heights, which
Israel seized from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
Habibi stressed that Israel should not only pull out of south
Lebanon but also from all the occupied Arab territories.
</P>
<P>
Khaddam, who arrived here Saturday afternoon on a three-day
visit, said that the Israeli "plot" aims to detach the Lebanese
from the Syrians and to destroy the resistance movement of the
Lebanese nation.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed satisfaction over growing trend of bilateral
relations, saying that close cooperation between Syria and Iran
will lead to restoration of peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders reviewed regional and international
developments, the role of Iran and Syria in defusing regional
crisis, and problems facing the world of Islam, according to IRNA.
</P>
<P>
They also exchanged views about respect to Iraq's territorial
integrity, non-interference of foreign powers in domestic affairs
of the regional countries, the Palestinian resistance movement,
cooperation among Islamic countries and defusing the Middle East
crisis through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
They voiced concern over Turkey-Israel military cooperation,
believing that it is to the detriment of regional security and
stability.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Youth Disappointed With Government: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 26 (Xinhua) -- On the eve of the 50th
anniversary celebration in Israel, most Israeli youth said they
were disappointed with the government, the English daily The
Jerusalem Post reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a poll, conducted early this year among 423
Jewish youngsters aged 13-18, as saying that only 26 percent of
them were proud of the government, while 68 percent were
disappointed and 6 percent indifferent.
</P>
<P>
The poll, which had a margin of error of 4.8 percent, also
showed that 66 percent of the youth were disappointed with the
Knesset (parliament).
</P>
<P>
On the other side, only 31 percent were disappointed with
the Jewish state, while a total of 65 percent said they were
proud of the country.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the poll showed that the youngsters are proudest
of the Israeli Defense Forces, with 87 percent saying they
were proud of the army, 11 percent disappointed and 2 percent
indifferent.
</P>
<P>
Shmuel Abuav, head of Israeli Union of Local Authorities,
said the poll showed that the army is seen as an apolitical
body that has values and goals with which the youngsters
identify.
</P>
<P>
But the youngsters tend to dissociate themselves from the
government and Knesset, which are by their nature political
bodies, he said.

LHASA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Tibet Autonomous

<HEADLINE> Children Can Be Susceptible to Hypertension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Nigerians medical experts have
warned that children blood pressure should be measured regularly
as they too could be susceptible to hypertension.
</P>
<P>
The members of the Nigerian Hypertension Society (NHS) at
their sixth annual scientific and general meeting held here over
the weekend revealed that hypertension has been found in many
children, disproving the old theory that hypertension is an adult
disease.
</P>
<P>
According to NHS Secretary Ambrose Isah, research findings had
shown that hypertension does not start in the elderly rather
people grow with it.
</P>
<P>
Some 10-12 percent of the populace are affected with ailment
which has been described as a silent killer because of damage it
does to body organs even in the absence of obvious symptoms, he
said.
</P>
<P>
A medical director of a western Nigerian clinic, who delivered
the lecture, said he had found 6,000 children in a research he
conducted across the globe.
</P>
<P>
The children with the exception of one were below the age of
nine, he said the Guardian reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In one research last year, he said, hypertension was found in
some children at the age of 0-18 years, an evidence that calls
for regular measure of children blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
According to them, growing with hypertension, which is
natural, still assumes an epidemic proportion especially among
the black population and the only solution to the ailment is to
tackle both the primary and secondary problem before it becomes
complicated.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the government to establish a center where
public education can be given to people on hypertension as well
as provide regular check up of blood pressure.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian State to Be Set up in 1999: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 26 (Xinhua) -- An independent Palestinian state
will be set up in May 1999, Secretary General of the Palestine
Liberation Organization Executive Committee Mahmoud Abbas said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinians will declare the establishment of the
Palestinian independent state in May next year on the basis of
Oslo agreement signed with Israel and in accordance with the
United Nations Security Council resolutions 242 and 338," he told
the Cairo-based Voice of Arabs Radio in an interview.
</P>
<P>
Seventy percent of the Israeli people do not oppose the setting
up of the Palestinian state, said the Palestinian official.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli talks have been stalled since March
last year when Israel began construction of the Jewish housing
project on Har Homa in East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians
wants as the capital of their would-be state.
</P>
<P>
Frustrated over the lack of progress in the peace process,
Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat and
Palestinian officials have recently repeatedly announced their
determination to declare an independent Palestinian state in 1999,
regardless of concluding a peace treaty with Israel or not.
</P>
<P>
Abbas, who is better known as Abu Mazen, called upon the
U.S. to double its efforts to salvage the stalled Mideast peace
drive.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Mideast peace envoy Dennis Ross arrived in Jerusalem
Saturday, together with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State and
former U.S. ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk, to begin a new
round of mediation aimed at reviving the Israeli-Palestinian talks.
</P>
<P>
Ross will demand that Israel accept the U.S. proposal for troop
withdrawal from a further 13.1 percent from the West Bank over 12
weeks, with each step met by Palestinian security measures.
</P>
<P>
In the interview, Abbas expressed hope that Ross would succeed
in persuading the Israelis to accept the U.S. ideas, thus paving
the way for the planned four-way talks in London to be co-hosted
on May 4 by British Prime Minister Tony Blair and U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Talks a Breakthrough: OIC Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The first meeting of the
Steering Committee is an "important breakthrough in the continuous
efforts to restore peace in Afghanistan," a senior official of the
Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"For the first time the opposing sides are meeting
face-to-face, with open minds to discuss their differences with a
view to reaching an amicable solution," said OIC Assistant
Secretary General Ibrahim Saleh Bakar at the inaugural session of
the meeting in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
Bakar said OIC Secretary General Azeddine Laraki welcomes "this
encouraging development" towards a peaceful solution to the
protracted Afghan conflict and hopes that both sides will make
concessions and compromises so that a lasting peace can be
achieved in the country.
</P>
<P>
Bakar also said any meeting like the one between the Taliban
and the rival Northern Alliance "cannot be expected to be smooth
and easy."
</P>
<P>
He advised the participants to remember that they were all
Afghans, having the same religious and cultural background.
</P>
<P>
"They should also remember that their decisions in the coming
days will be reflective on the Afghan nation as a whole especially
the helpless women and children who are always the most affected
victims of any civil war," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the amount of destruction and loss of lives that the
civil war is causing is too great to be left to continue
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
It is this reason that the OIC and the international community
attach great importance to the Steering Committee meeting as a
first step to resolve the Afghan conflict, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Steering Committee meeting had been made possible due to
untiring efforts of well-meaning individuals, countries and
organizations, he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the participants were holding their
deliberations in an atmosphere of peace, brotherhood and
understanding.
</P>
<P>
"May we succeed in our endeavor to bring back normalcy to
Afghanistan," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the inaugural session earlier, Pakistani foreign
Minister Gohar Ayub Khan reiterated his country's stand that the
Afghan problem should be solved through peaceful negotiations
under the auspices of the U.N. and the OIC."
</P>
<P>
"It is gratifying to see that this process is taking a
meaningful start today," he said. "It is a great development and
we should all put our sincere efforts to help this process reach a
meaningful conclusion."
</P>
<P>
He urged all the participants to commence with a spirit of
accommodation for the general good of all Afghans irrespective of
their sect of ethnicity.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Official Hopes Ice Dancing Dropped from Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- A senior International Olympic
Committee official is suggesting that ice dancing be dropped from
the winter games because of the wide accusation of result-fixing.
</P>
<P>
Dick Pound, an IOC vice president from Canada, said in Sydney
on Sunday the image of the Olympics has been marred by what he
described as blatant, predetermined standings in the dance
competition.
</P>
<P>
Pound was reacting to the judging controversy at the Nagano
Games in February when the Canadian pair of Shae-Lynn Bourne and
Victor Kraatz were deprived of what many thought should have been
at least a bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
Pound said he would raise the issue at the IOC executive board
meetings in Sydney this week and would suggest ice dancing be
dropped until the judging system is deemed fair and
comprehensible.
</P>
<P>
Many thought Bourne-Kraatz skated even better than the gold
medalists, and their coach, Natalia Dubova, claimed the judges
conspired to keep the Canadians off the medals podium.

<HEADLINE> Team Set Up to Help Improve Kenya's Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 26 (Xinhua) -- An inter-parties forum on the
economic crisis facing Kenya has unanimously agreed to set up a
19-member parliamentary committee to facilitate parliamentary
contribution to improve economic governance in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Nation said Sunday that the committee chaired by
Finance Minister Simeon Nyachae was mandated to seek ways to
salvage the East African country's economy.
</P>
<P>
After two-day consultations at the forum which ended Saturday,
participants recommended that Kenyan Parliament should use all
mechanisms available to fight corruption in the country and to
control government expenditure.
</P>
<P>
The forum, which was attended by 162 members of Parliament
from both the ruling and opposition parties, officials from the
World Bank and heads of diplomatic missions, asked Kenyan finance
minister to prepare short- and long-term economic recovery
programs, and present them to Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the forum sponsored by the World Bank, the
U.S. government and the German NGO of the Friedrich Ebert Siftung
recommended that the number of government ministries should be
cut down from 25 to 18.
</P>
<P>
It was also resolved that donors at the forum agreed any
initiative toward economic recovery should be a kenya-led
strategy, unlike in the past when the Bretton Woods institutions
have imposed prescriptions on Third World countries.
</P>
<P>
At the opening session held in the port city of Mombasa last
Friday, Kenyan Finance Minister Nyachae said that the government
has no money under the present situation of a "tattered economy"
and corruption in high places had contributed directly to the
mismanagement of Kenya's financial affairs.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the minister noted that Kenyans were
noticeably poorer today than they were 18 years ago with the
income every Kenyan had falling from 21,000 Kenyan Shillings in
1980 to 15,000 Shillings in 1998, or from 420 U.S. Dollars to
260 Dollars, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
The estimated proportion of the population living below the
poverty line has risen steadily from 44 percent in 1989 to around
50 percent today, he added.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Relocate Households Residing in Imperial Garden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Beijing will spend more than 100
million yuan (12 million US dollars) to relocate all 615
households within the ruins of Yuanmingyuan, an imperial garden in
northwestern part of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The work is expected to be completed before October 1, 1999,
the 50th founding anniversary of new China. Those households will
be moved to new buildings outside the park.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Haidian District government, where
Yuanmingyuan is located, said the move is necessary to preserve
the imperial park.
</P>
<P>
Yuanmingyuan covers an area of 350 hectares. It was completed
in 1859 after 150 years of construction. In that era, emperors
spent most of their time in the garden.
</P>
<P>
However, Yuanmingyuan was burned and destroyed by British and
French allied forces in 1860.
</P>
<P>
The present park was built on the ruins of Yuanmingyuan and
opened to the public in 1986. The park now occupies 167 hectares.

<HEADLINE> Only Ulema Commission to Resolve Afghan Issue:Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The head of the Taliban's
five-member delegation to the talks with the rival Northern
Alliance said Sunday that only the proposed Ulema (religious
scholars) Commission would be able to resolve all the Afghan
issues.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremonial meeting of the Joint Steering
Committee which began in Islamabad earlier in the day, Abdul
Wakeel said the Taliban hoped the negotiations with the
anti-Taliban Northern Alliance will yield "positive results."
</P>
<P>
However, he said, if the Ulema Commission is not recognized,
"any negotiations will be symbolic."
</P>
<P>
The Taliban representative said the Taliban are entering into
the negotiations with "sincerity," and are ready to work for a
peaceful settlement of the Afghan issue.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Northern Alliance to reciprocate the Taliban's
"sincerity" for the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We are not working for personal profits. We have an important
historical task on our shoulders. Let's work for peace and
stability in Afghanistan," he said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is made possible by efforts of the U.N., the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), and Afghanistan's
six neighboring countries as well as Russia and the U.S.
</P>
<P>
A written statement by Taliban leader Mohammad Umar also said
the Islamic militia "have suggested the Islamic decision by Ulema,
we reaffirm the same and do not have any other formula, because we
consider the decision of Ulema as sufficient for solving all the
problems."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting, the head of the Northern Alliance
delegation, Fazal Hadi Shinwari, said they welcomed Wakeel's
speech and appreciated the efforts for bringing together "the two
brothers" to a face-to-face meeting.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the neighboring countries,
especially Pakistan, will continue to support Afghanistan's peace
process for an eventual solution to the Afghan problem.
</P>
<P>
"We are asking the neighboring countries, the U.N., as well as
OIC to make their best efforts so we could reach a conclusion
after 20 years of war," Shinwari said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between the two warring Afghan factions, sponsored
jointly by the U.N. and OIC, is the first face-to-face parley
since the Taliban took over the Afghan capital of Kabul in
September 1996.

<HEADLINE> Confusion, Panic Hit Zimbabwe's Financial Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 26 (Xinhua) -- There was confusion and near
panic in Zimbabwean financial markets last week as rumors of
serious problems at one of the merchant banks circulated, the
Sunmail reported.
</P>
<P>
Investors and financial institutions were extremely nervous
and checks started bouncing, the Sunmail said.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean Dollar came under pressure due to reduced
tobacco inflows and reports of a surge in importer demand. On
Thursday, indicative rates for the local currency were 17 to the
U.S. Dollar, representing a depreciation of around five percent
from the previous week.
</P>
<P>
The local currency is set to fall further unless the reserve
bank intervenes.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the news on inflation was not good either. The
consumer price index for March rose by 3.9 percentage points to
27.9 percent on year-to-year basis. Food prices rose by 33.7
percent over the same period. When food is factored out, the
underlying rate of inflation stood at 24.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The outlook is not encouraging. Broad money supply reportedly
was rising at annual rate of 33.7 percent in January and in that
month the trade deficit widened to 8.4 million U.S. Dollars
compared to 6.1 million Dollars in December.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Says Encouraged by Afghan Factions' Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations felt
encouraged by the resumption of peace talks between Afghanistan's
Islamic Taliban militia and their rival Northern Alliance, the
head of the U.N. Special Mission on Afghanistan said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremonial meeting of the Steering Committee,
James Ngobi also expressed the hope that the joint committee would
work with "full dedication" and pave way for the establishment of
the Ulema (religious scholar) Commission.
</P>
<P>
The Steering Committee is made up of five Taliban and nine
Northern Alliance delegates.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, sponsored jointly by the U.N. and the Organization
of the Islamic Conference (OIC), is the first face-to-face
encounter between the two Afghan rivals in more than a year.
</P>
<P>
"If you are faithful to your commitment to the real peace, the
U.N. will always at your help," he said.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of the mediating role of Pakistan and U.N.
Special Envoy on Afghanistan Lakhdar Brahimi who has been visiting
the region in the last three weeks.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the key to peace lies in the hands of the
Afghan warring factions themselves.
</P>
<P>
"We are just playing the role of "facilitator," he said. "If
you want durable peace, then put down your arms and sit for the
negotiations."
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan
described the talks as a "meaningful start" towards the
restoration of durable peace in that war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
The on-going intra-Afghan talks were made possible by the
hectic diplomatic efforts by the U.N., OIC, Pakistan, the U.S. and
other countries who have influence in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Ulema Commission, proposed by the Taliban, will bear the
responsibility for deciding the future political set-up in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The Joint Steering Committee is yet another attempt to iron out
the differences between the Taliban and the alliance after the
former rejected the latter's first Ulema list.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Anticipates Publication of U.S. Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 26 (Xinhua) -- As United States peace envoy
Dennis Ross began his new mission here, Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu believed Washington is to present its plan for
a 13.1 percent pullback next week, a newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The English daily The Jerusalem Post reported that Netanyahu
told senior ministers Saturday night that U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright will officially present its peace plan during
her upcoming London talks on May 4.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu held the previously unannounced Inner Cabinet meeting
at his residence just ahead of his meeting with Ross, who arrived
here Saturday in company with Assistant Secretary of State for
Near East Affairs and former U.S. Ambassador to Israel Martin
Indyk.
</P>
<P>
The Inner Cabinet also includes Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai, National Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon and
Industry and Trade Minister Natan Sharansky.
</P>
<P>
No details were disclosed about the three-hour Netanyahu-Ross
meeting in the Prime Minister's Office Saturday night, but top on
Ross' agenda was to persuade Netanyahu to accept the U.S. proposal
for a 13.1 percent redeployment in the West Bank so to break the
year-long deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
Ross's visit will also lay the ground for the four-way London
talks to be co-hosted by British Prime Minister Tony Blair and
Albright, who will hold separate meetings with Netanyahu and
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is expected to launch his last-ditch efforts to
disuade the U.S. from publishing the peace plan. Netanyahu
reportedly told his senior ministers that unless the size of a
third redeployment is set, Israel would not agree to a second
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Until now, the Israeli government has not indicated any
willingness to accept any proposal calling for more than 9
percent troop pullback in the West Bank. But some reports said
Netanyahu is considering a 11 percent pullback in exchange for
PNA's promise to increase fight against terrorism and enter the
final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
Ross will meet with Arafat Sunday and return to Jerusalem to
hold another around of talks with Netanyahu. As a compromise, the
PNA has already endorsed the U.S. proposal for a 13.1 percent
redeployment and is demanding the U.S. pressure Israel to accept
the plan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Netanyahu is to reconvene the Inner Cabinet meeting
Sunday to discuss the Ross' mission and to coordinate the Israeli
position on the further redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Noting the depth of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute over the
redeployment, the U.S. has downplayed expectation for a dramatic
breakthrough from Ross' new round of intensive mediation.

MANILA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
Sunday ordered government departments to mobilize local disaster
coordinating councils to quickly create firebreaks against the
forest fires raging near the summit of Mt. Apo in the Southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement released by the presidential office,
Ramos also ordered Defense Secretary Fortunato Abat, who is also
chairman of the National Disaster Coordinating Council, to utilize
all other measures to bring the fires under control.
</P>
<P>
Ramos asked Abat to submit to him a feedback by Monday on the
action, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said that since Friday morning, the fires have
destroyed an undetermined number of hectares of forest within the
forest reservation of the Philippine National Oil Company near
Lake Macadac and the peak of Mt. Apo, in the Southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The fires, which might have been triggered by slash-and-burn
farming, are threatening the ecosystem of the country's highest
peak and a geothermal power plant there, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The 9,690-foot-high Mt. Apo, an active volcano, is home to the
endangered monkey-eating eagle and other wildlife.
</P>
<P>
During the Last three months, forest fires have hit eight
provinces in the country. In Palawan Province alone, 15,000
hectares of forest were destroyed by the fires.

<HEADLINE> ILO Calls for Sustained Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Representatives attending a
meeting arranged by the International Labor Organization (ILO)
have called for sustained economic growth to solve the problems
arising from the financial crisis in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Government officials and representatives from workers' and
employers' organizations attending the meeting emphasized that
social problems resulting from the financial crisis could only be
solved "in the context of sustained economic growth."
</P>
<P>
The meeting called for renewed efforts to set up appropriate
regulations of financial systems and improve corporate governance
and the functioning of markets.
</P>
<P>
The meeting stressed the need to respect basic international
labor standards, prevent any possible discrimination against
vulnerable groups such as migrant workers and women, and put an
end to child labor, according to a statement issued Sunday by the
ILO at the end of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The statement noted that the financial crisis in East and
Southeast Asia, which came "totally unanticipated" following
decades of high economic growth, has led to a "swift and
substantial" rise in unemployment, underemployment and poverty.
</P>
<P>
The statement called for a strengthening of the capacity of
governments to "monitor" the employment implications of overall
economic policies, and an "upgrading" of the educational and skill
levels of the labor force.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also urged the introduction of unemployment
insurance schemes, protection of workers' wages and severance pay,
and a broadening of social systems to help informal workers in
urban and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by representatives from China,
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, South Korea, Singapore,
Thailand and Vietnam.

KAMPALA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Shaman Pharmaceuticals Inc, a
U.S. company, has been conducting research in traditional herbal
medicines in Uganda without approval from the government, The New
Vision reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>

Reed Army Institute of Research in Baltimore, Maryland of the
U.S.
</P>
<P>
Iwu has already succeeded in converting the anti-hyacinth

<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister

in Islamabad as a "meaningful start" towards the restoration of
durable peace in that war-torn country.
</P>

</P>
<P>
The talks "generated renewed expectations for peace in
Afghanistan," he said, calling on Taliban and alliance delegates
to work seriously for the general good of the Afghan people.
</P>
<P>
He regretted that the conflict has brought severe destruction

He reiterated that Pakistan's consistent stance on the Afghan
issue was to seek peace through negotiations under the auspices of
the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference
(OIC).

delegates from the Taliban and nine from the alliance, is

<HEADLINE> Fire Damage in Indonesia Reaches One Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The forest fires which have been
raging in Indonesia's East Kalimantan province since January have
burned some 442,800 hectares of land with losses estimated to
reach 8.270 trillion rupiah (1.06 billion U.S. dollars), official
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The worst hit are the forest concessionary areas, where almost
253,000 hectares of land were charred with material losses
estimated to reach 5 trillion rupiah (641 million U.S. dollars),
according to data from the province's Natural Disaster Control
Unit, media reports reaching here Sunday said.
</P>
<P>
Based on the National Oceanic Atmospher Administration (NOAA)
satellite data, 13 hot spots were detected in East Kalimantan
forests where deposits of coal are rich.
</P>
<P>
A data officer at the local disaster unit said the satellite
data failed to provide the exact number of hot spots, as some were
covered by clouds or haze when satellite photos were taken.
</P>
<P>
He also said the latest drought index in those areas has
reached 2,000, a number considered close to "dangerous."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the reports said, many orangutans have been forced
to seek safer places in nearby settlement areas since forest fires
broke out in the Kutai National Park in East Kalimantan.
</P>
<P>
In the past month, the disaster unit has saved dozens of
injured or starving orangutans fleeing the fires in the park, a
provincial official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Many of the around 2,000 orangutans in East Kalimantan are
currently wandering at the settlement areas.
</P>
<P>
"We give them food or treat them if they are sick and later
release them again," said the official.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to extinguish the fires -- blamed largely on big
companies and farmers using slash-and-burn methods to clear land
for planting -- have generally been unsuccessful in the
drought-stricken province where little rain has fallen since last
July, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou Workers Monthly Income Exceeds 120 US Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The average monthly income of
workers per capita in this capital of south China's Guangdong
Province exceeded 120 US dollars in the first quarter of this
year, up 9.2 percent over a year ago, according to official
statistics.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou's per worker monthly income in the first three months
was the highest among China's ten largest cities.
</P>
<P>
As income grows, Guangzhou residents are spending more on
non-commodity consumption. Residents in Guangzhou spent an average
608 yuan for non-commodity consumption in the first quarter, which
accounted for 24.5 percent of all spending during the period, up
from 22 percent for all of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics also indicate that Guangzhou residents'
spending on health care rocketed 2.5 times in the first three
months. The growth rate for spending on transportation and
telecommunication and on entertainment was up 30.9 and 9.4
percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
While demand for major household electric appliances such as
refrigerators, washing machines and color TV has basically
saturated in Guangzhou, high-quality and multi-functional air
conditioners, stereo systems, VCDs and cameras have become new hot
buys, according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
Despite spending rises, Guangzhou residents' savings deposits
at banks grew 7.4 percent in the first quarter to 165.7 billion
yuan by the end of March.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou residents also purchased 2.99 billion yuan worth of
state treasury bonds in the first three months, 3.7 times the
corresponding figure of last year.

<P>
COLOMBO, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lanka navy seized 17
kilograms of heroin Saturday from a boat in Negombo lagoon, 35 km
from Colombo, the Sunday Observer newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
One suspect was arrested along with the contraband, but two
others aboard the boat jumped into the sea and escaped.
</P>
<P>
The navy said at least three boats were involved in the
smuggling and a bigger quantity of heroin could be in the other
boats.
</P>
<P>
The seizure was handed over to local police.
</P>
<P>
It is the largest drug smuggling case in Sri Lanka this year,
and is also the third largest haul of drugs in the island country.
</P>
<P>
The biggest seizure of heroin was made in 1989 at Colombo
Airport where a Nigerian national was arrested with 29 kilos of
heroin.
</P>
<P>
The drugs may have been originating from Afghanistan. Drug
smugglers usually purchase the contraband goods in Pakistan and
transport them by boat to Sri Lanka from South India.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Factions to Start Crucial Talks Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's Taliban militia
and the rival Northern Alliance will begin on Sunday their first
formal face-to-face meeting in more than a year, with an aim to
negotiate an early end to the protracted conflict ravaging their
homeland.
</P>
<P>
The Joint Steering Committee, which is made up of five
delegates from the Taliban and nine from the alliance, is to meet
at 10. a.m. (local time) at the Punjab House near the National
Assembly in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is being jointly sponsored by the United Nations
and the Organization of the Islamic Conference.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have already agreed on a tentative agenda,
designed to achieve an ultimate objective of establishing peace
and forming a broadbased government in their homeland, a spokesman
for the Pakistani Foreign Office said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
After holding a ceremonial meeting, the rival factions would
immediately proceed to working sessions, and they would first
formally adopt the agenda, which "at the moment is a secret
agenda," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the agenda may include the establishment of
a Ulema Commission, ceasefire, exchange of prisoners of war and
provision of aid to the Afghan people.
</P>
<P>
On the duration of the meeting, he said, it depends on the
process of the talks. Both sides will assess the situation on the
basis of progress, and will move forward accordingly, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban militia now control about two thirds of
Afghanistan, including the capital Kabul, and have imposed a
strict Islamic rule on a country gripped by 20 years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
The Northern Alliance, which controls the rest of the country,
consists of the ousted Afghan president Burhannudin Rabbani,
former Afghan military chief Ahmad Masood, ethnic Uzbek warlord
Rashid Dostum and a Shiite Muslim faction.

<P>
NEW DELHI, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The sensitive index on the
Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) market during the week dropped 230
points in the wake of heavy bull liquidation and profit-booking by
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
The BSE sensitive index rose to 4,285.57 on Tuesday, but
dropped to 3,954.31 on Friday, before ending the week at 4,049.98
as against the last weekend close of 4,186.76.
</P>
<P>
The national index dropped by 59.41 points to 1,780.64 at the
weekend from the previous weekend close of 1,840.05. The BSE-200
and US dollar index were quoted down at the weekend close at
402.28 and 168.66 compared with last weekend's close of 417.07 and
174.86 respectively.
</P>
<P>
The volume of business on BSE was up at 74,608.9 million rupees
(1,937.89 million U.S. dollars) during the week from last week's
turnover of 51,999.4 million rupees (1,350.63 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The downslide on the BSE market was arrested to some extent by
speculation of a likely cut in the Cash Reserve Ratio and the
Statutory Liquidity Ratio in the ensuring credit policy. Finance
Minister Yashwant Sinha's reported opposition to curbing inflation
through a tight monetary policy also found favor with the market.

ZAGREB, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Local officials and the United
Nations representatives signed Saturday in Drvar, a town west of
Sarajevo, an agreement to protect the safety of returning ethnic
Serb refugees and local Croat residents.
</P>
<P>
This agreement was their joint reaction to the clash between

After the incident, security has been strengthened by the
Multinational Stabilization Force and local police.
</P>
<P>

ISLAMABAD, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's Taliban militia
and the rival Northern Alliance Sunday entered into their first
formal face-to-face meeting in more than a year, with an aim to
negotiate an early end to the protracted conflict ravaging their
homeland.
</P>
<P>
The Joint Steering Committee, which is made up of five
delegates from the Taliban and nine from the alliance, met here as
scheduled under the auspices of the United Nations and the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC).
</P>

Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan, OIC Assistant
Secretary General Ibrahim Saleh Bakar, acting head of the U.N.
Afghan peace mission based in Islamabad N. Gobi, and diplomatic
envoys from Afghanistan's six neighboring countries, as well as
those from the U.S. and Russia attended the inaugural ceremony.

<P>
After holding a ceremonial meeting, the two rival factions
would immediately proceed to working sessions, and they are

an Ulema (religious scholar) Commission, ceasefire, exchange of

<P>
YANGON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar government has closed

<HEADLINE> Thai PM Backs Crackdown on Corrupt Policemen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
has voiced support for efforts to purge senior traffic police
officers who allegedly order their subordinates to extort cash
from motorists.
</P>
<P>
"No policemen, senior or junior, will be spared if there is
evidence pointing to their involvement (in the extortion)," the
prime minister said in remarks published by Sunday's Nation
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Chuan was commenting on the case of a group of junior
expressway traffic policemen who last week told the ITV television
news station that they were forced by their superiors to extort
cash from motorists.
</P>
<P>
The exposure came after the station aired footage showing
policemen at an expressway toll gate taking money from motorists
they had pulled over.
</P>
<P>
The allegations prompted the Interior Ministry and the Police
Department to threaten a purge of police officers involved in the
scandal.
</P>
<P>
Chuan described the problem as a case of chronic bad moral
values among certain people and said it would take time to correct
this.
</P>
<P>
"People should not tolerate something like this, and we have to
be serious in trying to correct it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Sanan Kachornprasart said Saturday that he
had ordered the national police chief to take drastic action
against any officers involved in the scandal.
</P>
<P>
Sanan said he also planned to discuss with Bangkok Governor
Bhichit Rattakul the possibility of canceling the traffic
regulation that entitles police who arrest law-breaking motorists
to a cash reward derived from fines imposed on offenders, since
the practice appeared to favor extortion.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a police officer, accused by his subordinates of
having ordered them to extort cash from motorists, denied all
allegations and said they had been fabricated by some policemen
whom he had transferred.
</P>
<P>
"The accusations are false. they just want to take revenge
after I ordered some policemen to be transferred for extorting
cash from motorists on the expressway on march 17," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. First Lady Questioned by Whitewater Prosecutors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton was questioned by Whitewater prosecutor Kenneth Starr on
Saturday about her legal work while President Bill Clinton was
governor of Arkansas, White House counsel Charles Ruff said.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released by the White House, Ruff said Hillary
Clinton was interviewed by independent counsel Starr and his staff
for about five hours at the White House on Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He said the first lady was under oath for the session, which
was videotaped for presentation to a grand jury in Little Rock,
Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
"The subjects, generally, were matters concerning the Rose Law
Firm's legal representation of Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan
and Mrs. Clinton's relationship with related individuals," Ruff
said.
</P>
<P>
The statement did not say whether the first lady answered all
questions posed to her.
</P>
<P>
It was the sixth time Hillary has been questioned in the
Whitewater inquiry since June 1994, including a January 1996
personal appearance before the grand jury. And it is likely to be
the last as the Whitewater grand jury will be dismissed on May 7.
</P>
<P>
Hillary was a partner at the Rose Law Firm and she and her
husband, who was then governor of Arkansas, were business partners
with James and Susan McDougal who were convicted of bank fraud
arising out of financial transactions related to the Whitewater
real estate investment deal.
</P>
<P>
James McDougal died last month in a federal prison in Texas
where he was serving time. Susan McDougal is serving two years in
federal prison on the fraud conviction.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors are trying to determine whether Hillary misled
regulators or tried to conceal documents at her firm about the
nature of her legal work.
</P>
<P>
The first lady has steadfastly denied any wrongdoing.

Shanghai and spur the growth of private firms.
</P>
<P>
Executive Vice-Mayor Chen Liangyu praised the measures as
aids to the rapid growth of the city's economy.
</P>
<P>
Under the new initiative, the Waigaoqiao Free Trade Zone will
enjoy faster development, the paper quoted Shen Yaohua, deputy
director of Shanghai Customs as saying.
</P>
<P>
High-tech enterprises, pillar industries and multinational
corporations can set up centers in the zone to distribute
parts. Maintenance bonded warehouses can also be established, Shen

<P>
A special information network will be created to link the

Customs will simplify procedures and approve projects faster
than before, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
Preferential treatment will be given to the processing trade
which now makes up 51 percent of the area's total trade volume.
</P>
<P>
High technology, pillar industries and technical projects will
enjoy high priority, he said.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises involving these sectors will be allowed to set up

<P>
PRAGUE, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The Czech police and customs have
seized 120 kilograms of heroin and arrested a number of drug
trafficking suspects in a recent anti-drug campaign.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Jiri Komorous, director of the Czech
anti-narcotics center on Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said the seized drugs had a street value of 290 million
Czech korun (about 8.8 million U.S. dollars) and the suspects were
now under custody.
</P>
<P>
In recent years drug traffickers have plunged this central
European nation into a trading center by taking advantage of its
easy connections to other countries.
</P>
<P>
With increased influx of drugs, drug abusers, especially among
the youth, have soared in number. It is reported that in the age
group of 14 to 18, drug taking rate reaches 41.2 percent,
with Prague leading the nation at 52.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Tax System to Broaden Scope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Fees charged by local governments
to fund the development of public facilities are expected to be
brought within the ambit of the taxation system as part of China's
drive to review off-budget levies, said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Those fees to be turned into taxes are likely to be charges
applied on an ongoing basis, such as those relating to
environmental protection and social security, the paper quoted
officials with the State Administration of Taxation (SAT) as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Fees for specific services provided on demand, such as issuance
of documents, are expected to be retained. Illegal fees will be
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
Besides local taxes, China's local governments at all levels
collect numerous fees for various purposes.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu Rongji last month said China's new government is
determined to stamp out irregular levies and turn some necessary
fees into taxes.
</P>
<P>
SAT vice-director Cheng Faguang said the transition to a market
economy makes it imperative to integrate as many fees as possible
with the taxation system.
</P>
<P>
He said the reform will remove extra burdens imposed on
enterprises and individuals by superfluous charges.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the reform would also improve the efficiency of
China's public finance sector.
</P>
<P>
Many off-budget items are unreasonable. Furthermore, funds
raised in such ways are often used ineffectively and even lead to
corruption.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance, the State Administration of Taxation
and the Economic Restructuring Office under the State Council are
working together to prepare a plan for the reform, according to Li
Jianbao, director-general of SAT's tax policy and legislation
department.
</P>
<P>
Their first move will be to conduct a survey to gain a clear
picture of the issue.
</P>
<P>
"The work will be very complicated. We will certainly meet with
obstacles in the reform because it will affect the interests of
certain parties," Cheng said, "But we are confident we will
succeed."
</P>
<P>
SAT officials said the reform may lead to changes concerning
local governments' rights to make decisions on taxation.
</P>
<P>
At present, varieties and rates of local taxes are all
stipulated by the central government, leaving the local government
no room to make adjustments according to local conditions.
</P>
<P>
Officials said they are considering the feasibility of
empowering local governments to make decisions on some local
taxes, including vehicle taxes, land occupation and butchery
taxes, but have not yet reached any conclusion.

<HEADLINE> Audit Office to Tighten Supervision, Fight Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- State auditors will sharpen their
vigilance over State finances and State property and step up
their fight against corruption, said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Auditors will be required not only to check the authenticity of
fiscal income and expenditure claims, but also to make suggestions
and give advice on how to strengthen management and improve
efficiency, the paper quoted newly appointed Auditor General Li
Jinhua as saying.
</P>
<P>
Appointed at the First Session of the Ninth National People's
Congress last month, Li is expected to face a challenging tenure
at the National Audit Office. A fully operational auditing system
suitable for the socialist market economy in China is supposed to
be put in place within the next five to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Li said auditors will pay more attention to helping audited
units establish scientific management system, strengthen
supervision and improve the operational efficiency of capital.
</P>
<P>
They will also shift their focus from individual cases to
analysis and research of common problems in order to be able to
offer suggestions to the government policy makers to improve
policies and regulations.
</P>
<P>
He said the finance sector and State enterprises are likely to
bear the brunt of tightened examination.
</P>
<P>
The financial turmoil that has battered Southeast Asian
countries since last year has highlighted the importance of
financial supervision in averting financial risks.
</P>
<P>
Li said scrutiny of State financial institutions and
non-banking financial institutions such as trust and securities
companies must be tightened.
</P>
<P>
His office will organize a nationwide audit of securities
companies this year, concentrating on four national broking houses
-- China Securities Co, Guotai Securities Co, Southern Securities
Co and Haitong Securities Co.
</P>
<P>
The National Audit Office checked 110 trust companies
nationwide last year and discovered a series of problems including
low quality of assets and high liability ratios, arousing the
concern of top leaders.
</P>
<P>
Famous for his impartiality, Li played a key role in the
investigation of the corruption case involving Chen Xitong, former
Party chief of Beijing Municipality.
</P>
<P>
A graduate of the Central University of Finance and Economics,
55-year-old Li said that in the past 15 years, audit offices
nationwide had helped the country reduce expenditure by a total of
140 billion yuan (16.9 billion US dollars).

Harbin, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Suifenhe, a border city in
Heilongjiang Province in northeast China, did 1.5 billion yuan
worth of private border trade during the January-March period this
year, and 9.05 million US dollars of the 11.87 million US dollars
worth of exports during the first quarter, came from the private
sector.
</P>
<P>
The city reported six billion yuan private trade value last
year and tax income from this field accounted for a third of the
city's total revenue.
</P>
<P>
A provincial government official says that there have been
about 400 Russians in Suifenhe buying goods every day since the
beginning of 1998, and during the Spring Festival, the number went
up to 2,000.
</P>
<P>
Trade fairs in the city have also attracted 4,500 businesses
from other provinces and cities in China.
</P>
<P>
Local officials attribute the growing trade to improved
Sino-Russian relations and quality in Chinese products, and to
preferential policies for traders.
</P>
<P>
Local bazaars have expanded from the garment and agriculture
trade of five years ago to 36 markets in building materials, furs,
and electric appliances with an 80,000-sq m space that now
attracts 15,000 business people.

<HEADLINE> Volkswagen to Improve Bid for Rolls-Royce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Volkswagen AG has decided
to make an improved bid for British luxury car manufacturer
Rolls-Royce, said German news reports Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A new offer put forward by Volkswagen chief Ferdinand Piech had
been endorsed by the company's supervisory board at a special
meeting Saturday evening, the German news agency DPA quoted
company sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Under the new plan, Volkswagen's previous offer of 1.1 billion
marks (611 million U.S. dollars) would be increased significantly.
The exact figure, however, was still unknown, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The new offer would also include pledges to keep the British
management and production site of Rolls-Royce and to boost the
annual output of the British noble brand from the current 2,000 to
about 10,000 units, the reports added.
</P>
<P>
The Volkswagen supervisory board reportedly also approved an
alternative plan which foresaw a revival of the company's former
super luxury brands of Horch and Bugutti should the bid for
Rolls-Royce fail.
</P>
<P>
With the new offer, Volkswagen wants to outgun its German rival
BMW which was selected by Rolls-Royce's parent Vickers as the
preferred bidders at the end of March.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Vickers and BMW are in exclusive negotiations about
the German carmaker's 340 million pound (570 million U.S. dollar)
bid for Rolls-Royce which Vickers reportedly wants to further
improvement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Vickers set the exclusive bargaining period for 30
days, which means that after May 1, it will in a position to
consider any improved bids.
