<HEADLINE> Steep Climb May Be Cause of THAI Plane Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Officials investigating the
crash of a Thai International Airways (THAI) plane last December
seemed to be convinced that the passenger plane went into a
steeper-than-usual climb after the third unsuccessful landing
attempt before it crashed to the ground in a southern province of
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the investigators disclosed here Friday that
the officials are finding out further evidence that the unusual
steeper climb was either the result of the pilot error amid poor
weather and visibility, or the result of a malfunction of the
plane caused by any passenger's mobile phone signals.
</P>
<P>
The THAI flight 261 with more than 290 passengers on board
crashed on December 11, killing 101 people.
</P>
<P>
The plane was said to crash as it apparently stalled after the
unusual climb.
</P>
<P>
Experts said when the speed of the plane does not match the
angle of ascent, an accident could happen. The safe angles of
climb for the crashed Airbus model were between three and 17
degrees.
</P>
<P>
Now it depends on the results of the analysis of the plane's
blackbox which could determine why the abnormal climb took place.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Considers to be Demilitarized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus government is
considering a plan that could demilitarize the island to reduce
tension between the Greek and Turkish communities, the Cyprus News
Agency reported here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Washington on Thursday, Cyprus
Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides said the plan would place an
international force on the island under a U.N. Security Council
mandate, replacing the armed forces both in the Cyprus Republic
and the Turkish Cypriot area.
</P>
<P>
"If we withdraw the arms, it ends the arms race," the Foreign
Minister said, adding "it has always been our position that
Cyprus should become a demilitarized country."
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides suggested that Cyprus could help fund the
international force though the money it would no longer allocate
from its defense budget.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not comment on how the plan is viewed by the
U.S. officials he is meeting during his visit this week in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkey landed its troops and took over the northern third of
the island in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in
Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that there are 35,000 Turkish troops and
some 4,500 Turkish Cypriot armed forces in the northern part
of the island. About 2,000 Greek troops are stationed in
southern Cyprus together with the 19,500-men Greek Cypriot
National Guard.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Deficit Surges to All-Time High in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. trade deficit
soared to an all-time high of 168.6 billion U.S. dollars last
year, the Commerce Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
As the world economic crisis hit U.S. manufacturers and
farmers, last year's deficit jumped 53 percent from a 1997
imbalance of 110.2 billion dollars, triggering the first decline
in exports in 13 years, the department reported. It surpassed the
old record of 153.4 billion dollars set in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Economists believe that the deficit for all of this year will
be at least 60 billion dollars worse than the 1998 figure as U.S.
exporters face continued troubles selling into global markets with
one-third of the world in recession.

<P>
HONG KONG, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Mexico, though devastated by
the news of the kidnapping of goalkeeper Jorge Campos's father,
beat Egypt 3-0 to capture the title of the Hong Kong Lunar New
Year Cup international football tournament here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Campos went home on Thursday after he was told his father was
kidnapped by armed men on Wednesday in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
In the match to decide the 3rd place, Bulgaria, led by famous
striker Hiristo Stoitchkov, did not meet much trouble before
beating Hong Kong League XI 3-0.
</P>
<P>
The Mexico-Egypt match saw both sides running and fighting too
much. But more experienced Mexicans, who entered second round in
last year's World Cup, totally controlled the first half and took
a 2-0 lead with better teamwork and good organization.
</P>
<P>
Fullback Rafael Marguez opened the scoring with a header at the
34th minute and Juan Manuel Abundis added the other nine minutes
later.
</P>
<P>
African champions Egypt fought hard in the second half and
Ibrehim Hassan was booked the second yellow card at the 61st
minute.
</P>
<P>
Mexico continued to attack and sealed the match at the 87th
minute when their captain Luis Hernandez slotted home on a penalty
shot.
</P>
<P>
"They played better than us today," said Egyptian coach Mahmoud
El Gohary.
</P>
<P>
Renowned for his powerful left foot, Bulgaria's Stoitchkov
scored with a powerful shoot four minutes after the match began
and his teammates Iovov Hristo and Raul Rofrigo Lara added the
other two at the 39th and 83rd minute respectively.
</P>
<P>
"It was a happy result, because it can give our young team more
confidence and experience," said Dimitrov Dimitar, the Bulgarian
coach.
</P>
<P>
The four-team tournament is the only annual international
soccer tournament held in the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR).

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM Announces Imrali Island as Restricted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit announced here Friday that Imrali Island in Turkey's
Marmara Sea, where the rebel Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan was
held captive, had become a restricted zone for security.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at a cabinet meeting in Ankara on
Wednesday, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit made the announcement as Ocalan, leader of the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), had been sent to a jail on the
island near Turkey's western province of Bursa.
</P>
<P>
Ships are forbidden from entering into the region and planes
are prevented from flying over the region, said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
He added that all those who want to pass in and out of the
island must get permission from a special organization.
</P>
<P>
A police team comprising eight senior police officers traveled
to Imrali on Thursday and will remain there until the conclusion
of preliminary questioning.
</P>
<P>
The court proceedings, during which Ocalan will be tried
within the framework of Article 125 of the Turkish Penal Code,
will begin as soon as possible after the completion of the
interrogation.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan faces death penalty in the case filed in the Ankara
State Security Court that accused him of being responsible for the
14-year Kurdish independence struggle which claimed over 37,000
lives.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was arrested by Turkish commandos in Kenya on Tuesday
when he left the Greek Embassy in Nairobi, where he had taken
refuge for 12 days after an undisclosed odyssey seeking asylum in
vain.
</P>
<P>
Greece, Turkey's long-time rival, and Kenya have accused each
other of leaking Ocalan's whereabouts to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the United States were also suspected of being
involved in Ocalan's capture. Israel denied any role in the event,
but the U.S. only denied involvement in Ocalan's actual capture.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan's arrest had triggared Kurdish demonstrations and
protests around Europe and the Middle East, some of which turned
violent and bloody.
</P>
<P>
Greece, Kenya, Israel have closed many of their foreign
agencies in the wake of the Kurdish unrest.

<HEADLINE> Air Bags May Cause Hearing Loss: Findings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Air bags, which protect drivers
and passengers in accidents, could cause hearing loss or
persistent tinnitus in the ear after crash, British experts warned
Friday.
</P>
<P>
An inflating air bag can generate a sound level of 170 decibels
lasting for 0.1 second, which could damage the ears, Graham
Buckley at Leeds General Infirmary in northern England and
colleagues reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Their findings, published in the British Medical Journal, are
based on two cases in which drivers suffered hearing loss and
tinnitus which they believe may have resulted from air bag
inflation in low-speed collisions.
</P>
<P>
One driver, a 38-year-old woman, with no known history of
hearing problems, suffered tinnitus and hearing loss in both ears
after the air bag struck her on the right side of the face.
</P>
<P>
The other person was a 68-year-old man, who had suffered
hearing loss before the crash. However, this worsened
substantially after the collision.
</P>
<P>
The researchers warned that injuries from air bags may be more
common in the future, as current safety design is moving towards
vehicles with air bags that inflate in frontal and side crashes
for both front seat passengers.
</P>
<P>
They suggested that lack of space means that side air bags
inflate very quickly and are closer to the ear.
</P>
<P>
The authors believed that such incidents of hearing loss could
be under reported as they are being attributed to other factors
associated with an accident. A victim is unlikely to register or
remember the noise of the air bag.
</P>
<P>
"It is therefore unclear whether the two cases are isolated
incidents or whether they represent a more widespread problem,"
they said.

<HEADLINE> SADC Summit on Angola and Congo (K) to Be Held </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe said here Friday that the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) leaders will hold a summit next week to review
peace efforts in Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC).
</P>
<P>
Mugabe told reporters after holding talks with visiting
Mozambican President Joacquim Chissano that the venue for the
summit at which Zambian President Frederick Chiluba will report on
his mediation efforts is yet to be decided.
</P>
<P>
Several such summits and other regional and international
meetings have been held since the beginning of the DRC war in
August last year but no obvious progress has been achieved yet.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said that Angola had already sought SADC's intervention
after the fragile Lusaka peace accord collapsed late last year
when Jonas Savimbi' s UNITA launched an offensive on Angolan
government forces.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba is on a regional tour consulting on ways to end the war
in the DRC, but his neutrality in mediation has been compromised
by reports that Zambia is aiding the Angolan opposition UNITA.
Angola has sent troops to fight alongside Laurent Kabila's
government army of the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Other countries supporting Kabila are Zimbabwe, Namibia and
Chad. Rwanda and Uganda have been criticized by the DRC government
 for supporting the Congo (k) rebels.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said, "We have pledged our support to Angola and we must
stop being theoretical about it but rather be practical."
</P>
<P>
"We can not just leave the people of Angola to suffer," he
added.
</P>
<P>
There has been speculation that Chissano, who is SADC
vice-chairman and has not been taking any active part in solving
the DRC conflict, could be taking over from Chiluba, but the
Mozambican leader denied this.
</P>
<P>
Chissano said, "All of us as leaders we are in the mediating
team and we should consult with each other on how best we can
resolve the crisis."
</P>
<P>
He said that because of its status within the SADC, Mozambique
should play a major role in the mediation of the DRC crisis
because the frictions between Angola and Zambia could frustrate
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique will take over the chairmanship of SADC from South
Africa later this year.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed bilateral trade between their
countries.
</P>
<P>
Chissano left for home Friday soon after his two-day official
visit to Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> London Ambulance Ready for Millennium Chaos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- London's ambulance service is
so concerned about the millennium bug that it has built an entire
duplicate control room in case its computer systems are disrupted.
</P>
<P>
The "mirror" control room, which costs 2.5 million pounds (4.1
million U.S. dollars), has been built at a secret location with
rows of identical computers and phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
The whole operation can be transferred in minutes in the event
of catastrophe, a BBC radio report said Friday.
</P>
<P>
All computers used by the service have also been purged of the
millennium bug and back-up telephone and power lines have been
installed in triplicate.
</P>
<P>
The service, which handles a hundred 999 emergency calls every
hour, says lives could be put at risk if they did not have a
comprehensive back-up system.
</P>
<P>
Managers of the service said that it is vital the ambulance can
respond as fast as possible to emergencies. One estimate suggests
that if response times are slowed by just 10 percent it could lead
to an extra 30 to 40 deaths an hour.

<HEADLINE> Kurds in Lebanon Protest Arrest of Ocalan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Nearly three thousand Kurds in
Lebanon staged a march in downtown Beirut Friday to protest arrest
of Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan by Turkish
government.
</P>
<P>
The Kurds, chanting pro-Ocalan slogans and raised PKK flags,
started their march from outside a United Nations' office in
Beirut's central district, and then moved to the Parliament
building and the government palace.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators burned Turkish flag and denounced the United
States, Israel and Greece of aiding Ankara in Ocalan's capture.
</P>
<P>
They presented a statement to House Speaker Nabih Berri and
Prime Minister Salim Hoss, demanding Lebanese authorities to seek
the support of international organizations and exert pressure on
Turkish government to secure the life of Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
Walid Jumblatt, Lebanese parliament member and leader of the
powerful Druze faction, took part in the protest and addressed the
angry demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
Jumblatt, the country's biggest opposition leader, claimed
that his family was originally Kurdish.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Kurds live in Lebanon, including at least
25,000 who had obtained Lebanese nationality since the 1950s. The
PKK had training camps in Lebanon in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, sought by Ankara for leading a 14-year separatist war
in which 37,000 people have died, was arrested on Tuesday in Kenya
and was repatriated to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Greek embassy in Nairobi granted refuge to Ocalan before he
was kidnaped by Turkish special agents as he tried to leave.
Greece and Kenya accused each other of leaking information to
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the United States were also rumored of being
involved in Ocalan's capture, an accusation they both denied.
</P>
<P>
However, Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said a "third
country," which he refused to name, gave tip-offs of Ocalan's
whereabouts to Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan's capture triggered Kurdish demonstrations and protests
around Europe and the Middle East, some of which turned violent and
bloody.
</P>
<P>
Israel, Greece and Kenya have closed many of their foreign
agencies in the wake of the Kurdish unrest.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Chief to Visit Morocco on Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdel Meguid will visit Morocco on Sunday for talks on the
latest developments of the situation in the Middle East, league
sources said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
During his five-day visit, Abdel Meguid will hold talks with
Moroccan King Hassan II, Prime Minister Abderrahmane El-Youssoufi
and Foreign Minister Abdel-Latif al-Filali, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The talks will center on the Middle East peace process, the
situation in Iraq and the future of Jerusalem, as King Hassan II
chairs al Kuds (Jerusalem) Committee under the Arab League.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between the Palestinians and Israel have been
stalled since December due to Israel's failure to carry out signed
agreements and its early general elections due in May.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations between Syria and Lebanon, on the one hand,
and Israel, on the other, came to a halt in early 1996 due to
disputes over the future of the Golan Heights captured by Israel
from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
Abdel Meguid will also discuss with the Moroccan side the
Lockerbie crisis between Libya, and the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Mediated by Saudi Arabia and South Africa, positive results
have reportedly been achieved over the Libya-West Lockerbie
crisis, in which two Libyans are suspected of blowing up the Pan
Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, killing 270
people.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain demand the two suspects be jailed in
Scotland if convicted. Libya has reportedly agreed to satisfy the
demand.
</P>
<P>
Abdel Meguid will attend an international conference on
Jerusalem on February 23-26 in Rabat under the auspices of the
king.
</P>
<P>
The conference will be attended by a large number of renowned
intellectuals and researchers of the Jerusalem issue, and Arab and
Islamic ministers.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want East Arab Jerusalem as the capital of
their future independent state. But Israel, which occupied the
whole city in the 1967 Mideast war, has said that Jerusalem is its
"eternal and undivided" capital and has taken steps to judaize the
holy city.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Opposition Parties Reject Law Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The National Constitutional
Assembly (NCA) of Zimbabwe, together with opposition political
parties, Friday rejected the proposal on a Presidential Commission
of inquiry into the constitution of the country.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, NCA said it had unconditionally rejected the
proposal of an inquiry as it felt the ruling Zimbabwe African
National union ZANU (PF) had no right to unilaterally determine
the process by which the constitution should be reformed.
</P>
<P>
At the ZANU (PF) Fourth National Conference held in Gweru last
December, the party's National Secretary, Eddison Zvobgo said that
a presidential commission would soon be set up to look into the
drafting of a new constitution.
</P>
<P>
He said the commission, to be appointed by President Robert
Mugabe, would hold wide consultations with a cross-section of
people countrywide.
</P>
<P>
"We strongly believe that the process of reforming the
constitution has to have support of all stakeholders and it can
only have that support if it is negotiated by and agreed to by
those stakeholders," Zvobgo said.
</P>
<P>
"However the route to this commission has not been negotiated
or agreed to by the stakeholders," NCA said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
NCA said that the proposal on the inquiry appeared to proceed
on the mistaken belief that people only have to contribute to the
content of the constitution and not the process leading to it.
</P>
<P>
"We feel that the process is inseparable from the content and
hence we demand that the process be negotiated by and agreed to by
stakeholders," it added.
</P>
<P>
It said that there must be convened a national conference to
agree on and define the reform process.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Denies Report on Arafat's Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 19 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian
official Friday denied a foreign report saying Palestinian
National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat is suffering from
arterial sclerosis and other diseases, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Tibi, senior advisor to Arafat, dismissed the report
which appeared Thursday on the London-based newsletter Foreign
Report as "nonsense," the radio said.
</P>
<P>
The newsletter quoted sources close to Arafat as saying that
"the man with a legendary memory nowadays cannot remember what
happened yesterday."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader, it continues, is aware of the problem,
and that is one reason he is anxious to resuscitate the idea of a
confederation with Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Arafat surprised the Jordanians and his own aides by raising
the old idea of a confederation of Jordan and a future Palestinian
state shortly after the funeral of Jordan's King Hussein last week.
</P>
<P>
The confederation plan, put forward by the Palestinian National
Council in 1985, was deliberated and then rejected by King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, there have been various reports over the
health of the 69-year-old Palestinian leader, triggering mounting
speculation about who will be his successor.
</P>
<P>
But Arafat ruled out the possibility of stepping down several
months ago, saying he will continue to carry on the Palestinian
cause and seek to establish a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel Radio said Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, spiritual
leader of the militant Islamic group Hamas, is "in stable
conditions" after receiving two days of treatment in a Gaza
hospital for respiratory difficulty.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has sent the 63-year-old Yassin flowers and wished him a
speedy recovery, the radio said.

<HEADLINE> Congo (K) Rebels Claim to Have Downed  Zimbabwean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Congolese rebels fighting
to remove President Laurent Kabila said Friday that they shot down
a Zimbabwean fighter plane on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The incident was confirmed by Moise Nyarugabo, Deputy Chairman
of Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD ), from the rebel
stronghold of Goma in the east of the Democratic Republic of
Congo, the Rwanda News Agency (RNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
''There were two or three Zimbabwean mig fighter planes, one
was hit and went to crash in the areas controlled by the enemy,''
Nyarugabo told RNA.
</P>
<P>
He said that the incident took place Thursday in the region of
Kabalo.
</P>
<P>
But neither the number of people who might have perished in the
incident,
</P>
<P>
nor the type of missile used to down the mig were disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Nyarugabo denied that the rebels have launched a big offensive
alleging that it is Kabila and his coalition who breached the
undeclared cease-fire that has been prevailing, as negotiations in
Lusaka were going on.

<HEADLINE> UNCTAD Chief's Term of Office Extended Until 2003 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The appointment of Rubens Ricupero
as secretary-general of the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD) has been extended from September 15, 1999 until
September 14, 2003.
</P>
<P>
The renewal of Ricupero's mandate for a period of four years
was recommended by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and was
approved by the General Assembly Thursday, said the UNCTAD here
Friday in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The main challenge ahead for the UNCTAD under Ricupero's
leadership will be its 10th quadrennial ministerial conference,
which will take place in Bangkok of Thailand in February in the
year 2000, the UNCTAD said.
</P>
<P>
At this world summit about development, the international community
will consider policies which are most likely to ensure the successful
integration of all countries concerned, particularly the developing
countries, into the world economy on an equitable basis and to avoid
the risk of further marginalization.
</P>
<P>
The conference is expected to agree on strategies that would make
globalization an effective instrument for the development of all
countries and all people.
</P>
<P>
Another major event under Ricupero's second term as the UNCTAD's
secretary-general will be the third United Nations Conference on the
least developed countries, to be held in the year 2001, in a
country, yet to be determined, within the European Union.

<HEADLINE> Romania Discovers Important Precious Metals Deposit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Romania discovered recently
one of its most important precious metals deposits in the
northwestern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
The deposit, located near the mining area of Rosia Montana,
amounts to about 16 million tons of ore with a two-gram gold and
14-gram silver concentration, which experts appreciate as very
good. However, estimates stand between 50 and 100 million tons.
Exploitation of the deposit will begin next year.
</P>
<P>
The deposit was discovered by the joint venture Explorer, made
up following a merge of the mining company Minivest Deva with the
Canadian firm Gabriel Resources.
</P>
<P>
Minivest Deva is running another investment program of about 30
million U.S. dollars with the Australian company Esmeralda.
</P>
<P>
The National Agency for Mineral Resources recently announced
the winners of the bids for the leasing of as many as 28
perimeters bound for geological exploration, with 15 of them for
gold and silver. Signature of the leasing contracts has already
started. Most of the bids' winners are foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. firm Gold Discovery Company took out a lease on seven
perimeters, the Explorer joint venture, the British company, and
the North-American company Minera Andes two perimeters each, while
the Australian company BHPE and the British company Mining
Exploration one each.
</P>
<P>
The leasing contracts provide a minimal exploration volume for
each perimeter, with investments estimated at over 50 million U.S.
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi FM to Visit Lebanon on Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister
Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf is due to arrive here on Sunday for talks
with Lebanese leaders over bilateral ties and regional affairs,
Lebanese foreign ministry sources said Friday.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit, Sahhaf is expected to deliver a
written message from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to his
Lebanese counterpart Emile Lahoud to explain Iraqi government's
position over its current standoff with the United States.
</P>
<P>
Sahhaf will also hold talks with Lebanese leaders over
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic ties between the two countries were cut off in 1994
after Lebanon accused Iraqi diplomats of killing an Iraqi
opposition figure in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. was reported Friday to have asked the
Lebanese government to cancel Sahhaf's visit.
</P>
<P>
"Washington contends a formal reception of Sahhaf in Lebanon
would mean the Lebanese government supports Saddam Hussein's
policies of refusing to abide by the United Nations Security
Council resolutions," Lebanon's An Nahar daily quoted unidentified
senior Lebanese officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. request, which was currently under consideration by
the Lebanese authority, was certain to be rejected because Lebanon
believes Iraq, as an Arab country, has a cause in denouncing
U.S. shelling attacks against the Iraqi people, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain launched a four-day air strike on Iraq in
mid-December last year, citing Iraq's non-cooperation with
U.N. weapon inspection team, which is charged with the dismantling
of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Air strikes on Iraqi bases by the U.S. and Britain have
frequented recently in the two no-fly zones in north and south
Iraq, which the U.S. and its western allies set up after the 1991
Gulf War triggered by Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Supports Zimbabwe's Family Planning Program </HEADLINE>

<P>
HARARE, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government has
allocated 3.5 million U.S. Dollars to support Zimbabwe's family
planning program, U.S. Ambassador to Zimbabwe Tom Macdonald said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Macdonald told the Zimbabwe News Agency in an interview here
that the money provided through the U.S. Agency for International
Development (USAID) was given to the Zimbabwean Ministry of Health
and Child Welfare and the National Aids Control Program (NACP).
</P>
<P>
The money would be used in projects aimed at expanding
Zimbabwe's family planning services through centers and outreach
programs that would emphasize the need for male participation in
family planning needs.
</P>
<P>
USAID Director, Rose Marie Depp said that some of the funds
would be used in projects aimed at slowing down the spread of
HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Already six HIV/AIDS testing sites, to act as pilot projects
for the voluntary aids testing approach had been identified
throughout the country.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Rejects Corruption Ranking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 19 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
Zimbabwean Information, Posts and Telecommunications Ministry said
Friday the government does not recognize Transparent International
(TI) which ranked Zimbabwe as the 42nd most corrupt country in the
world.
</P>
<P>
The official said the rankings were done by people with an
agenda to tarnish the image of the country, the Zimbabwe News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said the rankings did not reflect Zimbabwe's real situation
on corruption because it was not clear what criteria was used to
compile the rankings.
</P>
<P>
But TI Zimbabwe Chapter Chairman, John Makumbe said corruption
was now rampant in Zimbabwe and it involved people in the
government and at times those in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Makumbe said because of the decline of the economy, some
individuals were involved in dubious activities just to enrich
themselves.
</P>
<P>
"While we still have other systems which work in this country,
on corruption we have nothing to be proud of," said Makumbe.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Asks G7 Finance Ministers to Spur Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 19 (Xinhua) -- At a time when even
modest increases in aid to the world's poorest countries could
save the lives of millions of children and women, assistance to
these nations is in a state of virtual free-fall, the United
Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the eve of this weekend's meeting of G7 finance
ministers in Bonn, Carol Bellamy, executive director of the
UNICEF, expressed the hope that both debt relief and increasing
bilateral Official Development Assistance (ODA) will be prominent
on their agenda.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy said the gathering presented an excellent opportunity
to reverse a grim decline since 1990 in international aid to the
poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
As bad as is the overall decline in aid, Bellamy said, trends
within that decline are shocking, and have particular impact in
children and women.
</P>
<P>
"As the purse-strings of many industrial nations have
tightened, millions of the world's most poor and vulnerable have
been literally written off. Increasingly, industrial nations are
determining by their actions, and by their inaction, which of the
poor will live and which will die," she said.
</P>
<P>
"If we know what to do and fail to do it, our responsibility is
greater. We should apply growing knowledge to raising the living
standard for the millions of children and women who are presently
being ignored," Bellamy added.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, the G7 nations' contribution to the general ODA has
fallen about 15 billion U.S. dollars, a reduction of almost 30
percent in real terms.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Deficit Surges to All-Time High in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. trade deficit
soared to an all-time high of 168.6 billion U.S. dollars last
year, the Commerce Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
As the world economic crisis hit U.S. manufacturers and
farmers, last year's deficit jumped 53 percent from a 1997
imbalance of 110.2 billion dollars, triggering the first decline
in exports in 13 years, the department reported. It surpassed the
old record of 153.4 billion dollars set in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Economists believe that the deficit for all of this year will
be at least 60 billion dollars worse than the 1998 figure as
U.S. exporters face continued troubles selling into global
markets with one-third of the world in recession.
</P>
<P>
Exports for all of 1998 fell 0.7 percent to 931.3 billion
dollars, the first setback in sales abroad since 1985. Until last
year, healthy export gains had contributed fully one-third of
total U.S. economic growth through the 1990s. Imports last year
jumped 5 percent to a record 1.10 trillion dollars as the U.S.
economy continued to post strong overall domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
The widening of the global financial crisis since July 1997 has
meant hard times for many U.S. exporters. Farmers suffered through
their worst year in a decade and many manufacturing companies have
been forced to cut back production and lay off workers.
</P>
<P>
The worsening trade performance has presented a political
headache for President Clinton, who took office in 1993 vowing to
negotiate global trade deals that would expand opportunities for
U.S. producers. The administration stressed that today's figures
highlighted the disparity between a strong U.S. economy and
weakness abroad.
</P>
<P>
In addition, U.S. producers of certain items, notably steel and
autos, have faced increased pressure from imports as crisis
countries have shipped their excess goods to the United States.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficits with both Japan and China widened last year.
The imbalance with China rose 15 percent to a record 56.9 billion
dollars, the highest ever for any country other than Japan, the
department said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. trade deficit with Japan rose 14 percent to 64.1
billion dollars, the second worst showing on record, surpassed
only by a 65.7 billion deficit with Japan in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. deficit with all Pacific Rim countries, the hardest
hit region from the global crisis, rose 33 percent in 1998 to
160.4 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The administration is already under increased pressure from
U.S. steel makers and their union to raise trade barriers to halt
a flood of cheap imported steel. The Commerce Department last week
issued a preliminary ruling that tariffs on certain types of steel
from Japan and Brazil would face increased tariffs of up to 70
percent.
</P>
<P>
The industry is also pressuring Congress to impose worldwide
quotas on steel, warning of more layoffs and bankruptcies without
government relief.

<HEADLINE> Russian Lawmaker Vows Aid to Belgrade if NATO Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 19 (Xinhua) -- A ranking Russian lawmaker said
Friday that he had assured Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
that Belgrade would get "any type of aid" if it was attacked by
NATO.
</P>
<P>
Sergei Baburin, deputy speaker of the State Duma, or lower
house of parliament, returned here earlier Friday following a
visit to Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
At a closed session of the State Duma, Baburin briefed fellow
deputies of his trip, made on the eve of a deadline for the
Yugoslav federal government and the Kosovo Albanians to reach a
political settlement.
</P>
<P>
NATO has stepped its pressure on Yugoslav President Milosevic,
threatening military strike if Belgrade remained opposed to the
deployment of NATO troops in Kosovo to enforce the settlement.
</P>
<P>
"If a military aggression against Kosovo starts, Russia will
have to render any assistance to the aggression victim, starting
from military-technical aid, in accordance with the U.N. Charter,"
Baburin told reporters after the Duma session.
</P>
<P>
He said that during his three-hour meeting with Milosevic, the
Yugoslav president pledged that Belgrade "will not surrender if a
war is started against it."
</P>
<P>
Baburin said the NATO demand to bring 25,000 troops to Kosovo
runs counter to international law.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gennady Zyuganov, leader of the Communist Party, the
largest faction in the State Duma, said the escalation of tension
around Kosovo calls for "more precise, clear, and concrete steps
to support the Yugoslavs."
</P>
<P>
"The Americans, as usual, are acting in the style of Hollywood
movies. (They) threaten and blackmail," he said.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Central Bank Chief Confident in Local </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Central Bank Governor
Micah Cheserem Friday dismissed as unnecessary a panic in the
currency markets after the departure of Finance Minister Simeon
Nyachae, but said a fall in the Shilling reflected that lower
interest rates are positive to Kenya's economy.
</P>
<P>
The Shilling dropped sharply in early trade to 65.50/66.00
against the U. S. Dollar, a record low this year, before bouncing
to 63.60/64.20 at 13:00 GMT, from an opening level of 62.55/62.75.
</P>
<P>
Cheserem said the sharp fall of the Shilling partly indicated a
drop in treasury bill yields this week and partly the "market
uncertainty'' arising from the appointment of a new finance
minister.
</P>
<P>
The central bank chief said the Shilling's exchange rate would
continue to be set by market forces, adding that a fall which
demonstrated lower interest rates would be welcome.
</P>
<P>
"An orderly drop in the Shilling exchange rate due to this
factor would be seen as positive development for Kenya's exports,
tourism and the country's balance of payments position,'' he said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Nyachae resigned from the government after being offered the
post of industrial development minister in Thursday's cabinet
reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
Cheserem said that reforms on Kenya's economy would continue
under Masakhalia, although the new man would face a tough test in
winning the confidence of foreign donors.
</P>
<P>
"Finance Minister Nyachae's departure will not end the economic
reforms drive," the central bank chief said. "The economic
policies and plans have not changed. It is reasonable for people
to be cautious over a new man and he will have to prove himself
fast.''
</P>
<P>
Cheserem said it would not be right to pre-judge Masakhalia and
he urged foreign donors and local business community to give the
new man an opportunity to table his own ideas.

KAMPALA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri

the big part of the continent is now independent, democratic and
operating liberal economics.
</P>

He made the remarks when holding talks with visiting Chairman

Museveni said that there is need for more private investment in
Africa so that local products are exploited for both regional and

They discussed possibilities through which the CDC can support
projects and private enterprises in Uganda to ensure they get good
returns.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting also attended by Ugandan Minister of Finance and
Economic Planning Gerald Ssendaula, the president thanked the CDC
for the assistance it has been extending to the country to improve
its manufacturing capacity.
</P>
<P>
Cairns, who came here Friday to explore more investment
opportunities, assured MUseveni of CDC support for the east
African country to ensure that private enterprises perform better.

lower house of parliament, following a closed-door session on
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We will have to provide military and technical support" to
Yugoslavia if military actions are taken against it, Seleznyov
said, adding that First Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Avdeyev
has departed for Rambouillet, France, where the warring parties in
Kosovo face a deadline of noon Saturday to reach a political
settlement or face NATO military strikes.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov said the negotiating process should be continued and
"no blackmail, no threats" should be used.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov backed Russian President Boris Yeltsin's "sharp
statement" earlier addressed to the United States concerning the
Kosovo problem.
</P>
<P>
"Neither the U.S. nor NATO aggression may be launched in the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia under any circumstances," he said.

ADDIS ABABA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of
African Unity (OAU) High-Level Delegation Ambassadorial Committee
held talks on the nine- month border dispute in the Horn of Africa
with Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin in Addis Ababa
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Ambassadorial Committee transmitted a message of concern of
the High- level Delegation on the sudden and violent escalation of
the conflict which threatens to further cause loss of human lives
and destruction of infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The OAU High-Level Delegation through the Committee of
Ambassadors reiterated its appeal to both Ethiopia and Eritrea to
"cease hostilities and to recommit themselves to the peaceful
resolution of the conflict based on the OAU proposals for a
framework agreement."
</P>
<P>
The talks are in accordance with the statement issued here
Wednesday by the OAU High-Level Delegation. The High-Level
Delegation consists of the Heads of State of Burkina Faso,
Zimbabwe and Djibouti and OAU Secretary- General Salim Ahmed
Salim.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued by the Ethiopian Foreign
Ministry, Seyoum said that Eritrea must join Ethiopia in accepting
the OAU framework agreement in order for the cessation of
hostilities to be realized.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea has no option but to accept and implement the OAU
framework agreement, said Seyoum.
</P>
<P>
He said it is the acceptance by the government of Eritrea of
the OAU peace plan and its speedy implementation by the two sides
that will bring about a solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Any attempt to sideline the peace proposals is absolutely
unacceptable to Ethiopia as it is to the OAU," Seyoum said, adding
that the internationally backed OAU peace plan is a comprehensive
proposals.
</P>
<P>
Seyoum said Ethiopia sincerely believes that there is no third
party better placed, as has already been demonstrated, than the
OAU to assist the two countries to come out of this crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said that Ethiopia is still firmly committed to facilitate
the work of the OAU High-Level Delegation.
</P>
<P>
The Ambassadorial Committee will fly to Eritrea's capital
Saturday to convey the message to the government of Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the European Union Delegation led by German Vice
Foreign Minister held talks with OAU Secretary General Salim and

<HEADLINE> Iraq Asks U.N. to End U.S. Air attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Iraq Friday urged U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to intervene to stop the air campaign
by the United States and Britain which it says is designed to
inflict damage without arousing international opposition.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the U.N. chief, Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister
Tareq Aziz said, "The United States and Britain are still intent
on implementing their policy of brutal aggression against the
people, government, national sovereignty and territorial integrity
of Iraq."
</P>
<P>
Aziz said their aircraft were continuing intensive strikes
against numerous Iraqi civilian localities, including cities,
residential neighborhoods and populated areas.
</P>
<P>
Alluding to four days of bombing and missile strikes launched
by the United States last December, Aziz said that resulted in the
whole world's condemnation of the assault in which it failed to
achieve its main objective of changing the national regime in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said U.N. silence in face of the actions by the United
States and Britain would have "dangerous repercussions for
international peace and security" and would represent "the
beginning of the collapse of the collective security system"
enshrined in the U.N. Charter, as well as a dangerous precedent in
international relations.
</P>
<P>
Aziz expressed the hope that the U.N. chief would take the
initiative of "urging the Security Council to meet all the
responsibilities assigned to it" under the charter and "to bring
an end to the unlawful actions" of the United States and Britain.

<P>
CAIRO, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic
briefs from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanon saw a budget deficit of 69.3 million
U.S. dollars in the first month of this year, down 57 percent over
the same period of 1998, the Daily Star reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
January also saw a primary surplus of 112 million dollars,
compared with 94.6 million dollars in 1998, said Finance Minister
George Korom.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Ecomax, the French West Indian supermarket group,
said that it had lost 15 million U.S. dollars in Lebanon in the
past two years, the Daily Star reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In response to the losses, the company is liquidating its
business, closing 13 stores and paying off its 80 staff.
</P>
<P>
The company's executives blamed the failure on inappropriate
market research, pressures from local competitors and redtapes
committed by Lebanese port authorities.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- France's flag carrier Air France has signed a code
sharing agreement on flights with Middle East Airlines (MEA),
Lebanon's national carrier, local press reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The code-share deal is part of an alliance accord signed
between the two airlines on August 22, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, Air France and MEA will conduct 19 weekly
flights between the two capitals from June 1 of this year.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanon and Syria are scheduled to sign bilateral
agreements to enhance cooperation in marine transport during the
Joint Lebanese-Syrian Transport Committee meetings in Damascus
next week.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper An Nahar reported Friday that the talks will
focus on land, air and sea transport in addition to railway
transport.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanon's Central Bank Governor Riad Salameh has said
that the government's 1999 budget should include a 2 billion
U.S. dollars borrowing program, local press reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the debt will be used to counter a budget deficit
expected to exceed 40 percent of spending. In 1998, the deficit of
spending was 43 percent.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Slow Light Speed to 38 MPH </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Scientists from Denmark and
the United States have successfully slowed the speed of light to
38 mph, a speed that a strong bicyclist could easily exceed, said
the British Nature Thursday.
</P>
<P>
When light travels through empty space, it zips at a speed of
186,171 miles a second, the highest speed anything can attain,
even in principle. A moonbeam takes only a little over one second
to reach Earth. However Danish physicist Dr. lene Vestergaard Hau
and her collaborators from the Rowland Institute for Science in
Cambridge, U.S. and Harvard University, managed to slow the light
speed to 38 mph.
</P>
<P>
They first created an optical medium called Bose-Einstein
condensate with its temperature cooled to absolute zero, that is
459.67 degrees below zero. They then let the laggard laser moves
through the high density group of atoms, the Bose-Einstein
condensate, and reached the speed of 38 mph.
</P>
<P>
This work will have many potential uses, not only a tool for
studying a very peculiar state of matter but also in optical
computers, high-speed switches, communications systems, television
displays and night-vision devices.

<HEADLINE> Canada Pledges Stronger Ties with Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

(by Gu Ming)
</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Visiting
Governor-General of Canada, Romeo LeBlanc, said Friday that his
country will reinforce its relationship with Tanzania and other
African countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Dar es Salaam, capital of
Tanzania, LeBlanc said his African tour is for "goodwill,
understanding and discovery. "
</P>
<P>
The governor-general said the trip is rewarding because what he
has seen is different from what he had thought, as there are
regional differences and positive development in Africa.
</P>
<P>
This visit reflects Canada's strong engagement in Africa and
its commitment to accompany those countries which are following
the path of democratic governance and economic reform, he said.
</P>
<P>
After a visit to Cote d'Ivoire, LeBlanc arrived in Dar es
Salaam on Wednesday evening for a four-day state visit to
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The program of this state visit, the first ever to Africa by a
Governor- General of Canada, also includes Mali and Morocco.
</P>
<P>
The governor-general is accompanied by Canadian Minister of
International Cooperation and Minister responsible for La
Francophonie, Diane Marleau, and by parliamentarians and
representatives of the business, non-governmental organizations
and arts and cultural communities.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in the east African country, LeBlanc has met
Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa and the former president Julius
Nyerere, who is a veteran statesman and the facilitator of the
Burundi peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Canadian business leaders held discussions with their Tanzanian
 counterparts in order to explore investment opportunities and
explore how to approach the market in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Marleau, who praised Tanzania as an emerging power at the press
 conference, announced Canada's support for two projects. One is
for the health and well-being of Tanzanian women and children and
the other for the training component of the new Songo Songo
gas-to-electricity project.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that "Canada will continue to accompany
Tanzania in its efforts to strengthen basic education, to support
democratic principles and to encourage the growth of
micro-enterprise."
</P>
<P>
"The changes now taking place in the relationship between
Tanzania and Canada will not only sustain our valued friendship,
but enhance it by strengthening and diversifying the partnership
between our countries and people," LeBlanc said.
</P>
<P>
LeBlanc will fly to the northern region of Arusha Saturday to
begin the second part of his Tanzanian visit.

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Friday
reiterated its warning to the Serbs that their walking away from
Kosovo peace talks would be a "serious mistake" that would lead to
NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
"They do face tough choices here and they need to understand
the consequences should they decide to walk away," White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
"It would be a serious mistake for them to walk away from
this process," he again repeated the warning. "They do face hard
choice and there will be very real consequences."
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic refused to meet with
U.S. Kosovo envoy Chris Hill in Belgrade on Friday, less than 24
hours before a noon Saturday deadline set for reaching a peace
agreement. NATO has threatened to unleash air strikes unless the
ultimatum has been met.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart spoke shortly before the start of talks between U.S.
President Bill Clinton and French President Jacques Chira, which
are to include a discussion of the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart also said the White House has been notified that
Russian President Boris Yeltsin was sending a message to Clinton
renewing his opposition to the use of military force by NATO in
Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Denies Giving Ocalan Diplomatic Passport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot government on Friday
denied that the passport screened on Turkish TV as the document
with which Kurdish guerilla leader Abdullah Ocalan had traveled
was issued by Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Turkish TV showed pictures of a red passport allegedly issued
by Cyprus' Immigration Department bearing the name of Lazaros
Mavros, under the identity of a Cypriot journalist, while carrying
the picture of Ocalan, leader of the outlawed Kurdish Workers'
Party.
</P>
<P>
According to government spokesman Christos Stylianides the
diplomatic passports of the Cyprus Republic are blue, not red,
issued by the Foreign Ministry, not by the Immigration Department.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cyprus' Attorney General Alecos Markides also stated
that the alleged Cypriot passport found by Turkey on Ocalan was a
forged document.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, whom Turkey accused of being responsible for the
14-year Kurdish independence fightings in Turkey which claimed
37,000 lives, was arrested by Turkish commandos on Tuesday in
Nairobi, Kenya.
</P>
<P>
He was now held captive in a jail on the Imrali Island near
Turkey's western province of Bursa pending trial.

CAIRO, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat arrived here Friday night for talks on the
latest developments of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is to meet with Arafat
Saturday morning, sources of Egypt's Press Center said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, a frequent visitor to Egypt, keeps close consultation
and coordination with Mubarak on the Mideast peace process, which
has been stalled since last December due to Israel's suspension of
the implementation of signed agreements between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Arafat came here after a trip to Rome, Italy, where he attended
a conference organized by the United Nations on projects of the
West Bank town of Bethlehem in the year of 2000, Egypt's Middle
East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the conference, the Palestinian leader said that
Jerusalem could be capital for both Israel and a future
Palestinian state without barriers or walls.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want the East Arab Jerusalem, occupied by
Israel in the 1967 Mideast war, as the capital of their
independent state.
</P>
<P>
But Israel says that Jerusalem is its "undivided and eternal"
capital and take steps to judaize the holy city.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 19 (Xinhua) -- As the clock is ticking
towards the Saturday noon deadline for the Rambouillet peace talks
on Kosovo, there is a possibility for the U.N. Security Council to
meet at weekend for a special session on Kosovo, a U.N. official
said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"There is some possibility, but not for sure at the moment,"
the official said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard told a press conference
that "It was not clear whether the Council would meet on the
subject of Kosovo on Saturday."
</P>
<P>
A deadline for a peace accord at the ongoing peace talks in
Rambouillet, France, has been set for 6:00 a.m. EST (11:00 GMT),
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacque Chirac is scheduled to meet with U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan in New York on Saturday, and the
issue of Kosovo is highly on the agenda during their meeting, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
If an agreement is not reached, NATO is ready to launch air
strikes against Yugoslavia. However, China and Russia, two
permanent members of the 15-member Security Council, has been
firmly against any use of force against a sovereign country.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council, which bears the primary responsibility in
the maintenance of peace and security in the world, has not given
any authorization on NATO's decision to launch air strikes on the
issue of Kosovo, a Serbian province in the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton and
her advisers are contacting dozens of political consultants,
Democratic donors and election law attorneys in a rapidly growing
effort to determine whether she will run for the Senate in New
York State.
</P>
<P>
The first lady did some of her own research Friday, meeting
privately in the White House with retiring New York Senator Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, a session that Press Secretary Marsha Berry
called "an opportunity to explore thoughts."
</P>
<P>
Several of Hillary's advisers said she was increasingly warming
to the notion of running. Yet they cautioned that her decision
could be weeks or months away. The advisers, contacted by
telephone in recent days, all asked not be identified.
</P>
<P>
One longtime ally said Mrs. Clinton will likely wait until
April or May to make up her mind. A second said it could be
longer.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Vice President Al Gore, after addressing the AFL-CIO
executive committee in Florida on Friday, told reporters, "If she
chooses to run for the Senate, I predict she will win and be a
great senator."
</P>
<P>
Gore, who is running for president, was asked if he would
consider her as a vice presidential candidate. He chuckled and
said, "You'll have to hold off on questions like that until she
can make her decision and I have the privilege" of winning the
nomination and choosing a running mate.
</P>
<P>
The possibility of a lengthy exploratory period worries New
York Democrats who have little hope of fielding quality candidates
until Mrs. Clinton gets in or out. Polls show New York Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, often mentioned as a possible Republican
nominee, leads all potential Democratic candidates with the
exception of Mrs. Clinton.

<HEADLINE> No Change in Economic Reform: Kenya's New Finance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's new Finance Minister
Francis Masakhalia pledged at his first press briefing here Friday
to carry on the country's economic reform program implemented by
his predecessor Simeon Nyachae.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no change in the on-going policy thrust,"
Masakhalia told the press, adding that his ministry would continue
to implement the policies as endorsed by the government without
wavering.
</P>
<P>
The new finance minister noted that a technical mission from
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) would visit his country as
scheduled on February 24 to discuss the stalled loans.
</P>
<P>
The IMF suspended the three-year loan of 205 million U.S.
Dollars to Kenya in 1997, throwing the country's economy into a
deep recession which has yet to recover.
</P>
<P>
Masakhalia, now 61, a little-known career economist, was
swapped with Nyachae from his post of Industrial Development
Minister and moved to the Treasury in Thursday's cabinet
reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
Nyachae refused to take up the post of Industrial Development
Minister and immediately resigned from the government .
</P>
<P>
The new minister also said that he would pay special attention
to ending graft and ensure the government resources to serve the
public interest. His ministry would publish half-yearly accounts
report as set Thursday by Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi.
</P>
<P>
Masakhlia told reporters that his ministry would make efforts
to improve its management of financial resources, a critical
factor to improving economic performance, creating job
opportunities and alleviating the poverty.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Denies Investigation of 100 Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The West African peace-keeping
force of ECOMOG Friday denied reports that some 100 of ECOMOG
soldiers are under investigation over allegations of the summary
execution during its offensive against the rebels in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG spokesman Lt. Col. Chris Olukolade said here that the
ECOMOG high command refuted the reports, saying that "there is no
investigation or activity currently going on in any ECOMOG
location in Sierra Leone."
</P>
<P>
He noted that no reports of such execution had been received
but assured that the ECOMOG force would investigate any such
report to sustain its integrity.
</P>
<P>
"The only people in our custody at the moment are hundreds of
captured and suspected rebels apprehended either in battle or in
the course of on- going cordon and search operations," the
spokesman stressed.
</P>
<P>
Olukolade stated that these were being screened for possible
legal action in line with the laws of the country and accused the
rebels of using the battle strategy of barbarism, human rights
abuse and cruel destruction of lives and property.
</P>
<P>
There were reports, citing Olara Otunnu, U.N. Special
Representative for Children and Armed Conflicts, as saying that
detainees, either rebels or their sympathizers, were summarily
executed during the offensive against the rebels in Freetown, who
invaded the capital on January 6.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted witnesses as saying that those executed were
 subjected to "inadequate" interrogation while no real effort was
made to establish the guilt or innocence of victims.
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG spokesman advised the media to avoid lending their
channels to the "diversionary campaign meant to justify the
atrocities of the rebels while blackmailing ECOMOG."

DAMASCUS, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister
Mohammed Saeed Al-Sahhaf arrived here Friday evening from Sanaa on
a visit to Syria.
</P>
<P>
His visit is part of a regional tour aimed at consulting with
Arab leaders and exchanging views with them on the latest
developments of the situation in the region.
</P>
<P>
The tour aims also to lobby support of the Arab states for the
Iraqi position on its conflict with the United States and Britain
that launched the military operation Desert Fox last December.
</P>
<P>
In a press release upon his arrival at the Damascus
International Airport, Al-Sahhaf condemned Turkey's interference

Turkish armed forces into northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He called on Turkey to refrain from such acts in line with
Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit's call on the other states to
stop interference into Turkey's domestic affairs.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Damascus, the Iraqi Foreign Minister is
expected to hold talks with his Syrian counterpart Farouq Al-Shara
who received him at the airport, on the regional situation
particularly the effects of the U.S.-British military strikes.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Launch Investment campaign in Southeast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit said here Friday that Turkey will speed up investments and
economic developments in its southeast.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Ecevit said that his cabinet
has decided to launch a comprehensive investment campaign in
southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Relevant ministries and public institutions have been directed
to launch the necessary planning and preparatory work aimed at
solving unemployment, lack of education, security and health
concerns in the region.
</P>
<P>
Under the decisions, Turkey will construct highways and
villages, promote private sector investments, create job
opportunities, build schools and health facilities in the region.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit accused the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) led by
Abdullah Ocalan of preventing investment from reaching the region
for years and stalking basic services to people.
</P>
<P>
The southeast of Turkey has been severely damaged as the PKK
launched a 14-year-old war for independence in the region, which
has claimed over 37,000 lives since August 1984.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was arrested by Turkish commandos in Kenya on Monday
when he left the Greek Embassy in Nairobi, where he had taken
refuge for 12 days after an undisclosed odyssey seeking asylum in
vain.
</P>

<HEADLINE> NATO Urges for Interim Political Solution in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 19 (Xinhua) -- NATO warned on Friday that it
is ready to take whatever measures necessary if the Rambouillet
peace talks end without any positive result.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said in a written
statement that the 16-nation bloc had prepared and were ready in
the event that military action is necessary.
</P>
<P>
He said that NATO fully supports the diplomatic efforts of the
six-nation Contact Group to secure an interim political settlement
which provides Kosovo with a substantially greater degree of
autonomy.
</P>
<P>
"The deadline set by the Contact Group for the parties to come
to an agreement is approaching fast," said Solana, "underlining
the urgency of finding a peaceful solution."
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group gave midday Saturday as the deadline for the
Rambouillet talks to come out with a result. The North Atlantic
Council, the decision-making body of the alliance, has planned to
meet Saturday afternoon to decide what steps to take next.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic reportedly refused to
accept the conception of a NATO-led international peacekeeping
force in Kosovo and declined to meet American mediator Christopher
Hill earlier on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The United States has sent 51 more warplanes to the region as
NATO prepares air strikes which the alliance had ordered last
October. There are now more than 400 NATO warplanes in the
region.
</P>
<P>
NATO is also readying the ground troops to be deployed in
Kosovo should the Rambouillet peace talks reach an accord that
both the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Kosovar Albanians
sign.
</P>
<P>
The western military alliance has planned to send in 2,300
troops as the advance elements and the final deployment of ground
troops in the Yugoslav province will total 28,000 to 30,000
troops.

<HEADLINE> U.S., France Warn Yugoslavia of "Serious Consequences" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- France and The United
States Friday warned Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic that he
faces serious consequences if he refuses to imply with NATO's
demand for deployment of peacekeeping troops in Kosovo, indicating
it would prompt NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
Visiting French President Jacques Chirac, at the start of talks
with U.S. President Bill Clinton, told reporters that NATO had the
resolve to force Yugoslavia to accept a settlement. "We
are...really determined and firm on this," he said.
</P>
<P>
Unless an agreement is reached between the Serbs and Kosovo's
ethnic Albanians, Chirac warned, "The side that does not
understand that would then have to bear all the consequences,
and those consequences would be serious for them."
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the Oval Office meeting, White House spokesman
Joe Lockhart issued a similar tough warning to Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
"It would be a serious mistake for them to walk away from
this process," Lockhart said. "They do face hard choices and
there will be very real consequences."
</P>
<P>
Lockhart also said the White House was notified that Russian
President Boris Yeltsin was sending a last-minute message to
Clinton renewing his opposition to the use of military force by
NATO in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
A military buildup continued in preparation for launching air
strikes if the peace talks at Rambouillet, France, fail to reach
any agreement.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said on Friday that the United
States was sending six B-52 bombers, which can launch tomahawk
cruise missiles, to Fairford Air Force Base in Britain as part of
the attack force in case a NATO strike is ordered against
Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> S. African-EU Trade Accord in Tatters: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The free trade agreement
between South Africa and the European Union (EU) drafted in Davos,
Switzerland, three weeks ago seems to be in tatters, South African
television SABC said Friday.
</P>
<P>
EU foreign ministers, who will gather in Luxemburg Monday to
assess the agreement, are unlikely to approve the draft deal, SABC
reported.
</P>
<P>
Some member states of the EU have indicated that they are not
satisfied with the deal and are insisting on thes speculation in Brussels that d
espite political noises,
certain EU countries are not keen at all to finalize the
agreement, it said.
</P>
<P>
What can be expected Monday will be some kind of announcement
that Europe agrees to the totality of the agreement in terms of
the political dimensions of it, SABC said, adding that it will be
nothing but a face- saving mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South African Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin
said his country will not change its position on the deal and
hoped the EU will keep to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
"We really feel that it is not possible for the EU to keep
re-opening matters, if we have not attempted to re-open any
matters," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated South Africa's position that a deal has been
struck and if there are any disputes among EU member states, they
should figure out the problems by themselves.
</P>
<P>
The deal drafted in Davos envisions duties being scrapped on
about 90 percent of total trade between South Africa and the EU
within 12 years.
</P>
<P>
About 95 percent of South African exports to the EU would be
duty-free within 10 years, while tariffs on 86 percent of the EU's
exports to South Africa would be scrapped within 12 years.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Refuses to Cancel Iraqi FM Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese government Friday
rejected a United States' request to cancel a scheduled visit by
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf to the country,
the Orient radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted government sources as saying that Lebanon has
told Washington that it can not meet the U.S. request as Sahhaf,
a foreign minister of an Arab country, will carry a written
message from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to his Lebanese
counterpart Emile Lahoud.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that the foreign minister will arrive here on
Saturday night on a two-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's newspaper An Nahar Friday quoted Lebanese senior
officials as saying that the U.S. had asked the Lebanese
government to cancel Sahhaf's visit as it believes that a formal
reception of the Iraqi Foreign Minister in Lebanon would mean the
country supports Saddam Hussein's policies of refusing to abide by
the United Nations Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The sources said in Beirut Sahhaf will hold talks with Lebanese
leaders on bilateral ties and regional affairs.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic ties between the two countries were cut off in 1994
after Lebanon accused Iraqi diplomats of killing an Iraqi
opposition figure in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
During the meetings, he will also explain his country's
position over its current standoff with the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain launched a four-day air strike on Iraq in
mid-December last year, citing Iraq's non-cooperation with
U.N. weapon inspection team, which is charged with dismantling of
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Air strikes on Iraqi bases by the U.S. and Britain have
frequented recently in the two no-fly zones in north and south
Iraq, which the U.S. and its western allies set up after the 1991
Gulf War triggered by Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Enterprise Network Association Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Zambia Enterprise Network
Association (ZENA) has been launched Friday in the capital of this
southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Officially launching the ZENA, Zambian Acting Minister of
Commerce, Trade and Industry, Syamukayumbu Syamujaye, said that
the association is part of the Southern African Enterprise
Network (SAEN). The distinguishing characteristic of these
networks is that they are made up of people who operate their own
businesses.
</P>
<P>
"We have consistently introduced and adhered to legislation and
policy that promote private sector driven economic development"
said the acting minister.
</P>
<P>
At policy level, he said, the Zambian government is helping
pave the way for the enterprises by easing restrictions on
cross-border movements of capital, goods, skilled manpower,
technology and the other ingredients necessary for the successful
exploitation of the resources.
</P>
<P>
He said the launching of the ZENA is an important landmark in
the economic development of Zambia and an important link in the
SAEN.
</P>
<P>
SAEN members from nine southern African countries and 13 chief
executives who are ZENA members attended the launching ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Libya Has Questions on U.N. Letter on Lockerbie Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Libya has responded to
a letter sent by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan sent to Tripoli
with some questions, which, however, are being studied by the
world body, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The Libyan ambassador, Ambassador (Abuzed) Dorda, has made
some preliminary observations on the secretary-general's letter.
We are now studying those," Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman did not disclose what issues Dorda had raised,
but he said they were "presented orally and informally." Another
U.N. source said Libya is seeking U.N. assurances that sanctions
against it would be lifted, rather than merely suspended.
</P>
<P>
Annan has the letter sent to Libya on Wednesday in hopes of
clearing the way for the trial of two suspects in the 1988 bombing
of a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
The letter contained clarifications about arrangements for the
two Libyan suspects to be tried before a Scottish court in the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The Pan Am jetliner exploded over Lockerbie on Dec. 21, 1988,
killing 259 people on the plane and 11 people on the ground.
</P>
<P>
Annan said earlier this week his letter offered the Libyans
"clarifications and answered some of their questions" and he hoped
it would be "sufficient for us to move forward."
</P>
<P>
The letter was reported to have included an assurance that once
the two arrived in the Netherlands, sanctions that the Security
Council imposed on Libya in 1992 and strengthened in 1993, would
be suspended.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions include a ban on international flights to and
from Libya, an arms embargo, the downgrading of diplomatic ties, a
freeze on some Libyan assets abroad and a ban on its import of
certain types of equipment used at oil terminals and refineries.
But there is no embargo on oil exports, Libya's economic lifeline.
</P>
<P>
Annan's letter was also reported to have told Libya that the
Scottish prosecutors would not attempt to undermine the Libyan
government; that U.N. monitors could ensure the suspects would not
be interrogated by British or American security services; and
that, if convicted, they would have the right to appeal to a
similar Scottish court sitting in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
If they lost their appeal, they would have regular access to
Libyan consular services while serving their sentence at Barlinnie
jail, near Glasgow.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain, in August last year, dropped
their insistence that a trial must take place in either country
and challenged Libya to make good on a promise to allow the
accused to stand trial in the Netherlands but before a Scottish
court, under Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
Libya accepted the U.S.-British offer, but rejected the demand
that the two accused, if convicted, should serve their sentences
in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who failed to persuade Libya into surrendering the two
suspects during his early January visit to the North African
country, later asked South Africa and Saudi Arabia for assistance,
which responded to the U.N. appeal with envoys sent to Tripoli.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Slams Israeli Blockade of Lebanese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 19 (Xinhua) -- South Africa Friday
condemned the blockade of the village of Arnoun in southern
Lebanon by the Israeli forces and its ally, the south Lebanon
army.
</P>
<P>
The action reinforced Israel's continued occupation of the
southern part of Lebanon, and was yet another example of Israel's
disregard for the sovereignty of its northern neighbor and the
well-being of the citizens of Lebanon, the South African Foreign
Ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Such actions only perpetuated the cycle of mistrust and fear in
the region, and were inevitably followed by violent revenge on
civilian centers in northern Israel, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
South Africa called upon the Israeli government to revive and
honor the spirit of peacemaking which led to the Oslo peace
accords.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli troops, with bulldozers, trucks and jeeps, entered
Arnoun late Wednesday and set up a barbed-wire fence around the
village to prevent people from leaving or entering without Israeli
permission.
</P>
<P>
The 35 Lebanese who remained in the village were told that
Arnoun was now part of the zone Israel has occupied in southern
Lebanon since 1985.
</P>
<P>
Israel insists that the security zone is necessary to protect
its northern settlements from cross-border attacks.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Regrets Over French Boycott of Drug Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The government of Myanmar has
expressed its regret over the refusal of France to participate in
the Fourth International Heroin Conference to be held here this
month.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the latest press release of the Myanmar Embassy in
Paris, an official Information Sheet said here Saturday evening
that it is regrettable that the French government has decided at
the last moment not to send a delegation to the Fourth
International Heroin Conference to be held in Yangon from
February 23 to 26.
</P>
<P>
It stressed, "The issue of drugs is a humanitarian issue and
not a political one, it is an issue related to human security. The
narcotic drug problem is not an individual national problem but a
global one. Nations cannot solve this problem by finger-pointing
and laying blame, but only through mutual understanding, help and
cooperation".
</P>
<P>
"Myanmar considers the fight against narcotic drugs a national
cause and is determined to carry on with or without the help of
the international community," it said.
</P>
<P>
It added that despite the lack of assistance from foreign
countries, Myanmar has waged a relentless war against drug
trafficking by relying on its own resources. Immense sacrifices
have been made by the security forces.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar will host the conference in cooperation with the Office
of Director-General of Interpol, expecting several dozen countries
to attend.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United States, Britain and some European
countries like Belgium, Sweden, Norway and the Netherlands have
announced boycott of the conference, over which Myanmar has
expressed regret, urging them to put politics aside for the sake
of the millions of people around the world whose lives are
threatened by the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
The first International Heroin Conference was held in
Washington, U.S.A., in 1994, the second in Istanbul, Turkey, in
1995 and the third in Genoa, Italy, in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Blair Defends Genetically-Modified Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 20 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair on Saturday delivered a spirited defense of the government's
refusal to ban genetically-modified (G-M) food, warning that such
a ban would jeopardize the UK's front position on the development
of biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
Blair said biotechnology will be "the revolutionary science of
the 21st century" and the United Kingdom (UK), which is leading
the world in this field, is facing intense international
competition, reported the Daily Telegraph newspaper.
</P>
<P>
To ban G-M food without proper scientific evidence will lead to
the loss of the UK's superiority, Blair said.
</P>
<P>
"There is no scientific evidence to justify a ban on G-M foods
and crops," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"If we were to ban products which our independent scientific
advisers tell us are safe, we would send a negative message to the
whole biotechnic industry in the UK -- that its future will be
governed not by evidence but by media scares," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"And we would stop British expertise in farming and science
from leading the way," Blair said, adding that the government was
committed to guaranteeing consumer's safety and would insist that
all G-M foods be labelled.
</P>
<P>
The British government's refusal to stop and investigate the
development of G-M foods has been attacked in the past week due to
warnings by scientists that such foods posed potential harm to
some people's health.
</P>
<P>
Environmental groups want to freeze development for five years
while more tests are carried out.

"Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Mohammed Sadiq al-Sader was target of
a vicious aggression" on Friday, the agency said. "The incident
also led to the martyrdom of his two sons," it added.
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi Information Ministry official source said that
"security authorities have apprehended some of the assailants and
are still chasing the rest of the criminals."
</P>
<P>
State-owned television and radio interrupted their programs to
announce Sader's death. Motives behind the assassination are not
clear now.
</P>
<P>
INA did not say where the attack took place.
</P>
<P>
Sader was seen to be close to the Iraqi government, which
appointed him the grand ayatollah to replace the late Abul Qassim
al-Khoei in 1992 despite the popularity of another cleric, Ali
Sustani.
</P>
<P>
In a move that was seen as an attempt to distance himself from
the government and establish himself as an independent leader,
Sader issued an edict six months ago calling on the Shiites to
attend weekly Friday prayers in mosques. The secular government
disapproved of big crowds.
</P>
<P>
Sader enjoyed high respect among Shiites, who comprise about
65 percent of Iraq's 22 million people. President Saddam Hussein
and most of Iraq's senior officials belong to the minority Sunni
Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Following the report of Sader's death, angry Shiite Muslims in
Saddam city, a neighborhood of Baghdad, took to the street and
clashed with police.
</P>
<P>
Security had been extremely tightened in the city and
ambulances were seen taking away the wounded.
</P>
<P>
No comment from the Iraqi government is available at this
moment.

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Five people were killed and
at least eight others injured when an explosion occurred in a
chemical processing plant in Allentown of Pennsylvania State in
the United States Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Rescue crews tried to sound optimistic following the explosion
at the Concept Sciences Inc. facility at the Lehigh Valley
Industrial Park, but the magnitude of the blast made them fear the
worst, said reports reaching here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The dead, who were not immediately identified, were among seven
people in the building at the time of the explosion.
</P>
<P>
The blast created a one-meter crater in the building and blew
out eight-meter high concrete walls and caused two stories of
concrete ceiling to collapse.
</P>
<P>
Authorities believed the explosion was triggered during the
distillation of the volatile chemical hydroxylamine, a substance
used by the company for processing salt in water heaters, said
John Conklin, director of the Lehigh County Emergency Management
Office.

<HEADLINE> Demonstration in Support of Ocalan Staged in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Some thousand demonstrators took
to the streets in Rome Saturday morning in support of Kurdish
rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, and a firebomb hurled against a
Turkish airline office in Rome caused a brief fire, but no one was
reported hurt.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Saturday morning, some fifty youths wearing crash
helmets and armed with sticks and shields charged police guarding
the Turkish airline office, which locates near the famous piazza
of Republic in Rome.
</P>
<P>
The police lines retreated as the youths hurled large
firecrackers against the office.
</P>
<P>
The marchers, including Italy's hard-left party's parliamentary
members, offered postcards addressed to United Nations Secretary-
general Kofi Annan calling for a fair trial for Ocalan, an end to
the "genocide" of his people, and the Kurdish question to be
addressed by the UN Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The march was one of the three planned in major Italian cities
Saturday. In Italy's southern city of Naples, some 50 left-wing
militants demonstrated peacefully in the city's central Piazza
demanding "freedom for Ocalan, the Kurdish people and all
political prisoners".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, police in northern city of Milan are now preparing
for what may be the tensest demonstration in front of the Turkish
consulate in Milan.
</P>
<P>
The reports from Ankara said that Kurdish Worker's Party leader
Ocalan, who was captured in Kenya on Tuesday, will be tried in
April for five days.
</P>
<P>
Pro-Kurdish demonstrations have continued across Europe since
Ocalan's capture.

TOKYO, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov arrived here on Saturday evening to discuss territorial
disputes with Japanese leaders and a bilateral peace treaty for
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov will hold a four-hour meeting, including a working
dinner on Sunday evening, with his Japanese counterpart Masahiko
Komura.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Ivanov is scheduled to have separate meetings with
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and Yoshiro Mori, Secretary
General of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).
</P>
<P>
However, according to a Japanese Foreign Ministry official, it
is unlikely that there will be an agreement or breakthrough on a
long-standing territorial dispute over four Russian-held islands.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov and Komura are also unlikely to reach agreements on
bilateral initiatives aimed at creating an environment for
resolving the territorial row, he said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides may reach agreements on other issues, including
setting up a joint committee to promote youth exchanges, he added.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov and Komura will also discuss Komura's spring visit to
Russia and Russian President Boris Yeltsin's official visit to
Japan.
</P>
<P>
Japan and Russia remain distant on how to resolve the
territorial dispute, with both countries holding conflicting views
and proposals, one proposed by Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto and a counter proposal raised by Yeltsin last November.

<HEADLINE> German's Death Sentence Rejected by Supreme Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Supreme Court has
turned down the death sentence on German businessman Helmut Hofer
for having an affair with an Iranian Muslim woman.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported on Saturday
that the Court has returned Hofer's case to the justice department
of Tehran province.
</P>
<P>
Public relations director general of the Judiciary Fotut Nasiri
Savadkuhi was quoted as saying the Tehran justice department will
assign another court to review the case and the future judge would
decide whether to set Hofer free or not, said Savadkuhi.
</P>
<P>
Hofer was arrested in September, 1997 and was sentenced to
death by a Tehran court in January, 1998 for having an affair with
an Iranian woman.
</P>
<P>
Iranian laws ban sexual relations between a non-Muslim man and
a Muslim woman. However, Hofer argued that he had converted to
Islam before having the affair with the woman.
</P>
<P>
Hofer's case had cast shadows on Iranian-German relations.
</P>
<P>
Bonn has called on Iranian authorities to release Hofer but
Iranian officials repeatedly claimed that the judiciary is
independent and Hofer's case should not be politicized.
</P>
<P>
The German government was working hard for Hofer's release and
the German Head of the Federal Chancellery Bodo Hombach would
visit Iran in February over the issue.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Calls for Non-interference in Judiciary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Turkey will not permit or
tolerate any attempt to interfere in its justice by any third
party, an official statement said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry issued the statement before Kurdish rebel
leader Abdullah Ocalan is to be tried on the Imrali Island in
Marmara Sea of Turkey's western province of Bursa.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was arrested by Turkish commandos in Nairobi, capital of
Kenya on Monday, and brought back to Turkey by a private plane
early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Accused by the authorities of being responsible for the Kurdish
separatist fightings that claimed over 37,000 lives, Ocalan faces
a possible death penalty if convicted.
</P>
<P>
Some western European countries have urged a fair trial of
the Kurdish leader and asked not to put him to death.
</P>
<P>
A wave of protest by Kurds swept across Europe after Ocalan was
captured, causing violence and bloodshed. Regarded as a hero by
Kurds, Ocalan has great influence and his arrest reportedly united
the bitterly-divided Kurdish nation.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish judiciary is independent and this independence is
final and without any pre-condition, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"It is impossible for anyone or any circle inside or outside
Turkey to temper with justice," it said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the statement accused Greece and Cyprus of
supporting Ocalan's Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), outlawed in
Turkey.

zone in east China's Zhejiang Province, exported 378 million U.S.

</P>

This growth rate was about 10 percent higher than the city's

More overseas-funded enterprises have become involved in
foreign trade, opening new outlets for the Ningbo zone. Last year,

HANGZHOU, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Rental cars have emerged a
new vogue for Chinese drivers who do not own vehicles and prefer
driving to taxis.
</P>
<P>
Some 30-odd car rental agencies in the Zhejiang provincial
capital of Hangzhou have rented close to 1,000 vehicles during the
Spring Festival holiday, which started on February 16.
</P>
<P>
Vehicles are rented for 10-15 days, with an average daily
charge of 200 yuan (24 US dollars), according to an official with
a local car rental agency.
</P>
<P>
Shen, a Hangzhou resident who works for a foreign-funded
enterprise, said he rents a car for 10 days each month for
business purposes and will rent a vehicle to visit friends and
relatives during the Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
Industry observers attribute the increasing popularity of car
rentals to the constantly rising living standards of Chinese
citizens and the nation's improved transportation system.

Saturday to become Labor leader of the Welsh Assembly, with 52.68
percent of the vote, beating off the challenge by Rhodri Morgan
with 47.32 percent.
</P>
<P>
The result was a victory for the party's leadership, who
preferred Michael, the Welsh secretary. He also had the support of
most of the big unions in Wales.
</P>
<P>
His opponent, Morgan, had to take around 80 percent of the
votes of ordinary members to win, but in the end he got 64.35
percent against Michael's 35.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The ballot was sparked by Ron Davies' resignation as Welsh
secretary last year.
</P>
<P>
Michael, who succeeded Davies, had shown no previous enthusiasm
for the Welsh Assembly job. But Prime Minister Tony Blair pledged
his personal backing for Michael's candidate and effectively
turned the contest into a loyalty test with Morgan cast as a
troublemaker.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: Indian PM Visits Pakistan by Bus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 20 (Xinhua) -- At the invitation of
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee Saturday afternoon crossed the Indo-Pakistan
border by bus for the first time in five decades to pay a historic
visit to Pakistan in a bid to ease their tension and enhance
mutual understanding and cooperation through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee was warmly received at the Pakistani border town Wagah
by his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif and they reviewed a
guard of honor before they flew to Lahore by helicopter.
</P>
<P>
The Indian prime minister called to "put aside the past and
make a new beginning" when he crossed the Radcliffe Line dividing
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"My message to the Pakistani people will be very short -- put
aside the bitterness of the past -- let us make a new beginning,"
he said. "I am visiting Pakistan at the invitation of Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif and throughout my visit I will derive
inspiration from the knowledge that prayers and goodwill of all
Indians is with me."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Vajpayee told reporters at his residence that he was
happy going to Pakistan to strengthen ties but felt sorry that
the two nations had lost so much time in coming together like
this. He later told reporters at Delhi airport that he wanted to
reduce tension in the sub-continent as India desired further
deduction in its defense budget.
</P>
<P>
He also said that he would extend an invitation to Sharif to
accompany him back to India. He said the visit would help find
solution to bilateral disputes.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers will hold talks in Lahore, the second
biggest city of Pakistan, on Sunday on a wide range of subjects
affecting their relations including Kashmir issue. This is the
first highest political level contacts between the two countries
on Pakistan soil after they resumed official-level talks in
October last year following their nuclear tests in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
Peace and security in the region, Kashmir issue and nuclear
restraint are expected to top the agenda at the one-to-one talks
between the two leaders.
</P>
<P>
The first delegation-level talks between the two sides will be
held Saturday evening and is likely to continue Sunday when the
two prime ministers formally meet.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee and Sharif will hold a joint press conference Sunday
evening before the Indian leader flies home.
</P>
<P>
The Indian prime minister's visit to Pakistan was welcomed both
by Indian and Pakistani public opinion, saying that will enhance
mutual understanding and ease tension between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Indian External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh Thursday evening
described Vajpayee's visit to Lahore by bus as the "most historic
engagement between India and Pakistan after the Shimla Agreement
in 1972".

<HEADLINE> Ivanov: Russia Will Not Give Up Kuril Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said Saturday that Moscow wants a large-scale treaty with
Japan but "will not accept any options that would mean giving up
the Kuril Islands."
</P>
<P>
Addressing local officials while making a stopover in Yuzhno-
Sakhalinsk on his way to Japan, Ivanov said "it would be an
anachronism to negotiate just a peace treaty with Japan half a
century after the end of the Second World War," Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"We want it to be a treaty of peace, friendship, and
cooperation, which will open large-scale prospects in all spheres,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Japanese Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi vowed last year to reach a peace treaty before the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to speak about the final form (of the treaty) today.
The talks will continue," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
"The framework of a possible solution is absolutely clear," he
said. "It should be mutually acceptable. It should not hinder
Russia's sovereignty and territorial integrity and should meet our
national interests. It should be based on the current realities,
be supported by the population and adopted by both countries' top
legislatures," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
The four Kuril islands, known as the Northern Territories in
Japan, have stalled relations between Moscow and Tokyo for decades.
</P>
<P>
Early last January, Japanese media reported that Tokyo was
considering the possibility of concluding an interim agreement
with Moscow on the transfer of two of the four islands to Japan
and continuing talks on the territorial status of the remaining
two islands.
</P>
<P>
Russia denied the reports as "unfounded" and said they were
intended to disrupt public opinions.
</P>
<P>
The long island chain was given to Japan in 1875 by Russia in
exchange for the northern half of Sakhalin Island. During the
World War II, Russia retook the islands from Japan along with the
southern half of Sakhalin.
</P>
<P>
In 1951, Japan relinquished all claims to the islands but later
reversed its stance on the southern Kurils, stating that these
islands had always been Japanese possessions.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the governments of the two countries restarted
discussions over territorial sovereignty and fishing rights in
order to find a peaceful solution.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Porcelain Items Discovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists
have unearthed more than 400 pieces of porcelain with the oldest
dating back to the Tang Dynasty (618-907).
</P>
<P>
The discovery was made recently during construction of a
highway in north China's Hebei province. The porcelain items were
buried underground in a 5,000 square meters area where the
archeologists excavated five ancient kilns in addition to some
tombs and workshops.
</P>
<P>
The unearthed items include cups, dishes, bowls and bottles,
most painted white. Some were very delicately made in the shape of
human beings, and some were possibly used for religious activities.
</P>
<P>
These porcelain products were made between the 7th and 13th
centuries, demonstrating the prosperity of the porcelain industry
in north China, the archeologists said.

<HEADLINE> Anhui Ports Witness Foreign Trade Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The nine ports in east China's
Anhui Province, a major agricultural producer, handled more than 1.
2 million tons of imports and exports last year, 24.7 percent
higher than the province's goal.
</P>
<P>
Within the total cargo, 399,000 tons were imports, up 125
percent from 1997.
</P>
<P>
Huang Defu, deputy director of the provincial Port Office, said
that the good result has not come easily because the province has
suffered a lot from both the worst flooding on the Yangtze River
in 40 years last summer and the lingering Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
According to Huang, Asian countries had made up the main part
of Anhui's overseas market.
</P>
<P>
Last year, exports of staple commodities like iron and steel
products through the ports decreased by 200,000 tons at least.
</P>
<P>
The negative impact of the Asian financial crisis will continue
through 1999, Huang said, so more flexible measures are to be
taken to establish new business ties with trade firms both at home
and abroad.

<P>
Vajpayee reached Wagah at 16:05 p.m. local time (11:05 GMT) on
the inaugural trans-border bus service launched as a confidence
building measure to improve the strained bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee, the first Indian prime minister to visit Pakistan in
a decade, was greeted by Nawaz Sharif soon after he set foot on
Pakistan soil.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders shook hands warmly, embraced and greeted each
other beside the bus on which Vajpayee traveled here.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee was also met by Pakistan's Information Minister
Mushahid Hussain and other senior members of the Sharif cabinet as

<P>
CANBERRA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Frankie Fredericks of Namibia
made a strong start to the year, when he clocked 9.94 seconds to
win the men's 100-meter race at the Sydney Athletics Grand Prix
Meet in Sydney on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Tuning up for a rare outing at the world indoor championships
next month, Fredericks got a flying start and soared away with a
tailwind to better the 9.99 seconds run by American Maurice Green
in Sydney last year.
</P>
<P>
Fredericks said: "It feels really good. Every time you run
under 10 seconds it's wonderful. It means that everything in my
preparation up to this point is going well."
</P>
<P>
Fredericks, the Olympic silver medalist in the 100- and 200-
meter events at the past two Olympics, is also the 200-meter
indoors record holder with 19.92. He said his biggest remaining
goal in track was the Olympic gold medal. Fredericks' main target

</P>
<P>
Australian pole vaulter Emma George improved her own world
record to 4.60 meters on her first attempt after easy clearances
on her two previous heights.
</P>
<P>
Her Russian coach Alex Parnov told her she should stop after
winning the meet with a 4.50-meter clearance but she asked for
another chance.
</P>
<P>
World 110-meter hurdles record holder Colin Jackson of Britain
struggled with jet lag but snatched the champion in 13.30 seconds,
followed by his compatriot Ross Baillie in 13.66.

<HEADLINE> Space Bred Crop Seeds Help Increase Yields </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 20 (Xinhua) -- China plans to increase crop
yields by using seeds developed after exposure to strong radiation
in space.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Agriculture Department under the Ministry
of Science and Technology told Xinhua that Chinese satellites and
high altitude balloons have carried seeds into space on seven
occasions over the past 11 years.
</P>
<P>
He said rice and wheat seeds bred in space have been planted on
70,000 ha in Heilongjiang Province in the northeast, Jianxi and
Shandong provinces in the east, and Hunan in central China.
</P>
<P>
Li Jinguo, associate researcher with the Institute of Genetics
under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), said seeds subjected
to radiation at an altitude of between 20-400 km and other forms
of special treatment offer greatly improved and much higher yields.
</P>
<P>
Li said, trials in the aforementioned provinces show that crop
yields can be raised by at least 10 percent on levels for ordinary
crop seeds.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists have developed rice seeds with output of
over 7,500 kg per hectare.
</P>
<P>
Scientists contend that China's ability to feed its population
of over 1.2 billion must rely on the development of modern
agrobiological techniques.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Rebel Group Drops Prisoner Swap Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- An anti-government group
holding two army officers as hostage in the southern Philippines
has dropped its demand for a prisoner swap in fear of a strike by
government forces, a senior military official said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Armed Forces Chief of Staff Joselin Nazareno disclosed that a
presidential assistant in Mindanao asked him to postpone the
military action against the New People's Army (NPA) as the rebel
group has dropped its demand for a prisoner swap.
</P>
<P>
The NPA abducted Brig. Gen. Victor Obillo, and Capt. Eduardo
Montealto in Davao City Wednesday when the two officers were
inspecting a government project.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the rebel group asked the military to free a detained
NPA commander in exchange for the release of the two officers.
</P>
<P>
The NPA commander was captured last year for his role in the
massacre of 39 innocent civilians in Digos, Davao del Sur, in
1989.
</P>
<P>
Nazareno said that Davao also asked the presidential assistant
to relay to the government the rebel group's intention to withdraw
its forces from Davao City.
</P>
<P>
Intelligence reports said that the rebels are still in the
jungle fastness of Davao City.
</P>
<P>
Elite government forces have reportedly started moving in to
pursue the rebels and free the two military officers.

<HEADLINE> UK Keeps Pressure on Yugoslavia as Deadline Looms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Britain on Saturday applied
final pressure to try to wrest agreement at Kosovo peace talks
half an hour before the deadline for an accord.
</P>
<P>
A British official said Cook met Serbian President Milan
Milutinovic to urge Belgrade to accept NATO peacekeepers in Kosovo
rather than face NATO bombing within days.
</P>
<P>
"There are indications of some progress on the political text,"
a British official was quoted by the Reuters as saying without
giving details.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Downing Street said Yugoslav President Milosevic
should be "under no illusion about our resolve," a BBC television
report said.
</P>
<P>
No responsible official was reached to make any comment on the
situation and Britain's standpoint as the deadline, which was set
at 1100 GMT on Saturday, had already passed.
</P>
<P>
NATO has warned that it would air strike the Serbian troops in
Kosovo if no agreement was reached in the peace talks currently
held in France.
</P>
<P>
But Yugoslav President Milosevic has repeated his position that
he would rather face bombing than give up Kosovo, which he said is
a province of Serbia and should be in full control of the Serbian
government.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Foreign Ministry on
Saturday denied a news report that Moscow has agreed to
participate in a planned NATO operation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The International Herald Tribune said that Russia supported a
possible NATO operation in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY)
so as to "give more weight to the pressure put on Belgrade by
certain Western states."
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a statement that Russia's approach to the
Balkan settlement has not changed.
</P>
<P>
Foreign troops can be deployed in Kosovo only with the sanction
of the U.N. Security Council and Belgrade's consent, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, who made a stopover in Far
Eastern Russia on his way to visit Japan, reiterated Moscow's
opposition to the use of force in the settlement of the Kosovo
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk that Russia and the United
States are divided on tactics in resolving issues such as Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
While Moscow advocates political methods in conflict settlement,
Washington tries to impose the use of force and sidestep the U.N.
Security Council, Ivanov said, adding that the differences in the
two countries' positions should not evolve into a global
confrontation.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Talks Continue After Deadline Expires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RAMBOUILLET, France, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Nearly an hour
after the deadline set by the six-nation Contact Group expired,
talks were going on in the chateau of Rambouillet seeking a final
compromise between the Serbs and Kosovo Albanians under mediation
of Western countries and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said that an agreement on the political wing
of the peace plan for Kosovo is within reach, while a concession
by Belgrade on the military wing will be waited for another day or
so.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav government has up to now rejected the proposal on
deploying a NATO-led multinational force in Kosovo to guarantee
the implementation of the political agreement on high degree self-
rule by ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of six-nation Contact Group are
continuing their talks with Serbian President Milan Milutinovic on
the terms of the deployment of international force in Kosovo, said
diplomatic sources close to the talks.
</P>
<P>
The talks around political questions were focused on the reform
of the legislative body in Kosovo and the separation of Serbs from
Albanians in judicial treatment.
</P>
<P>
The Serbs will continue to be subjected to Serbian judicial
authorities instead of Albanian judicial authorities, while the
idea for a second parliamentary chamber for other ethnic
minorities in Kosovo has been abandoned because of Albanian
opposition, according to the sources.

<HEADLINE> Milk Powder Oversupplied in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Stocks of milk powder have
been piling up at an alarming speed in China, officials say, due
to overproduction and underconsumption.
</P>
<P>
The stock has been growing at an annual rate of 30 percent
since 1993. Last year, the oversupply amounted to 50,000 tons,
making up about 15 percent of the country's total output.
</P>
<P>
Milk output grew by 4.8 folds to 6.63 million tons last year
compared with the figure for 1980. However, the per capita annual
milk consumption in China stands at only six kilograms,
representing a meager one fifteenth of the world average, and one
fifth of the consumption of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Despite the overproduction and low consumption, the country
every year imports about 60,000 tons of milk powder. This, plus
about 40,000 tons of smuggled milk powder from overseas, further
aggravates the oversupply. In stores in large cities, foreign
brands make up about half of the sales.
</P>
<P>
The surplus has diluted the profit margin and even brought
losses to many of the medium- and small-sized producers and forced
some herdsmen to kill their milk cows.
</P>
<P>
Shoddy products, inferior packaging and the neglecting of the
importance of advertising are also problems blamed for the
oversupply.

<HEADLINE> Russia Urges Restraint as Deadline for Kosovo Deal Expires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Despite the expiration of a
deadline for the Yugoslav authorities and Kosovo Albanians to
reach a political settlement, Russia said Saturday that talks have
not come to a standstill.
</P>
<P>
"The international community must exercise maximum restraint
and lead the talks in Rambouillet to the logical and only possible
conclusion -- the signing of an interim political agreement on
Kosovo within the parameters agreed upon by the Contact Group,"
the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement released here.
</P>
<P>
Russia is a member of the six-nation Contact Group on former
Yugoslavia, which also includes Britain, France, Germany, Italy
and the United States.
</P>
<P>
"A lot was done to achieve this. Although the dialogue on the
outskirts of Paris proceeds with difficulty, we have never been as
close to a serious political decision which could ensure long-
lasting peace and stability in Kosovo, in the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia and in the Balkans as a whole, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The sides must exercise the political will and not torpedo the
negotiating process. They must concentrate on finding compromises
and reaching an agreement," the document said.
</P>
<P>
Russia remains adamantly against any use of force in the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , the statement said, stressing
that the use of force would sidestep the U.N. Security Council and
cross out all the positive achievements thus far obtained in the
Kosovo settlement.
</P>
<P>
Military actions can lead to new casualties and an
unpredictable turn of events, the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Nine Kurds Still in Custody For Seizing Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Nine Kurdish Protesters remain
in custody on Saturday after being charged with illegally
occupying the Greek Embassy in London earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
They were among 74 men and five women, who appeared in four
different courts at Horseferry Road Magistrates in central London.
</P>
<P>
The 79 Kurds reportedly forced their way into the Greek Embassy
in west London on Tuesday, after learning that their leader,
Abdullah Ocalan, was arrested by Turkey special agents from Kenya
while he was on his way from the Greek Embassy in Nairobi to the
airport.
</P>
<P>
The protesters surrendered to London police on Thursday
afternoon, ending the siege peacefully, and were taken to the
police station for questioning.
</P>
<P>
All 79 were charged under the Public Order Act of 1986 with
violent disorder. Only 70 were released on conditional bail, the
London police office said.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, who is wanted by Turkey for his role in leading
guerrilla forces fighting against Turkish rule, is now in custody
in Turkey.

LAHORE (Pakistan), February 20 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee arrived here Saturday afternoon on a
two-day historic visit to Pakistan for crucial talks on
contentious issues including the Jammu and Kashmir dispute.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee reached at Wagah, a border checkpost located around 22
kilometers east of Punjab's provincial capital of Lahore at 16:05
p.m. local time (11:05 GMT) on an inaugural trans-border bus
service.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee, the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Pakistan in
a decade, was greeted by his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif
soon after he set food on Pakistan soil.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders shook hands warmly, embraced and greeted each
other beside the bus on which Vajpayee traveled here.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee was also met by Pakistan's Information Minister
Mushahid Hussain and other senior members of the Sharif cabinet as

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Vows to Win War Against Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa announced that the Tanzanian government will go on
with the anti- corruption campaign until it is won.
</P>
<P>
Meeting a group of foreign envoys and representatives from
international organizations here Friday, Mkapa said the government
has punished thousands of corrupt officials since he came to power
in 1995, local newspapers reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The newspapers, quoted information provided by the State House,
as reporting that the government has removed 20,000 "ghost" civil
servants who are still on the government payroll although they are
retired or dead.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government has dismissed 800 revenue
collection officials on the suspicion of corruption or
questionable integrity.
</P>
<P>
The government has also retired a number of ranking officials
in the public interest, including nine senior officials in the
Immigration Department, 10 in the police force, five from the
Prisons Department, six from the Prime Minister's Office, and 41
from the Ministry of Works.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a minister of finance and his deputy, and a
minister of natural resources and tourism lost their positions.
</P>
<P>
In the judiciary, three magistrates were dismissed, 43
magistrates were retired and five court brokers had their licences
revoked. Among the large parastatals, five chief executives were
retired.
</P>
<P>
Last year, President Mkapa created a Consultancy Team headed by
Judge Joseph Warioba, a former prime minister, to combat
corruption.
</P>
<P>
A report submitted last month by the team acknowledged that
major steps have been taken to combat corruption, including legal
and administrative reforms and education programs for leaders and
general public.
</P>
<P>
The findings of the team acknowledged that the government of
President Mkapa has put anti-corruption high on the national
agenda.
</P>
<P>
Last year, regional and district commissioners were directed by
the president to conduct public hearings on corruption in all
wards within three months and report to him on the implementation
and outcome.
</P>
<P>
The public response to the directive is very encouraging. Legal
and administrative actions are being taken by appropriate
authorities to deal with the public servants who have violated
ethics or proved to be a public nuisance.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the president invited ministers and members of
parliament to send to him names of corrupt servants who cannot be
removed from office by them but can be done by the president. So
far, according to the press secretary to the president, the
response has been good.
</P>
<P>
The president emphasized the need for civil education,
transparency, supervision of services and imparting knowledge to
the ordinary person as a vital tool of getting rid of graft.
</P>
<P>
He vowed to continue fighting corruption, declaring the war
must be won since there is a will to fight.
</P>
<P>
Ambassadors from the European Union, Canada, the United States,
Norway, and resident representatives for the World Bank, United
Nations Development Program, United States Agency for
International Development, and International Monetary Fund,
exchanged views with the president at the meeting, and praised
Tanzania for its seriousness in fighting corruption.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Non-performing loans (NPLs) of
the Philippine commercial banking industry declined to 160 billion
pesos (about 4 billion U.S. dollars) as of last December, or by
10.4 percent from the last November level, Central Bank Governor
Gabriel Singson said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Singson told reporters here that the decline translates to an
NPLs ratio of 10.3 percent in the month, significantly lower than
the 11.82 percent in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
But what is more notable is that the commercial banks appear to
be lending out again, he said.
</P>
<P>
As of the end of last December, Singson said, the commercial
banking industry shows a 2.11-percent growth of total portfolio
from the previous month.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that the reduction in the country's NPLs
last December was due to a restructuring of the past due loans.
</P>
<P>
The NPLs ratio may go up again this year as some companies are
expected to face difficulties with the continuing weakness of the
economy, which is projected to grow around 3 percent this year,
Singson said.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Hosts Socio-Economic Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 20 (Xinhua) -- In cooperation with the
International Labor Organization, the Federation of Nepalese
Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI) held here Saturday a
one-day socio-economic summit to formulate strategies for the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
Former Bangladeshi President Hussain Muhammad Ershad, former
Pakistani President Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari and former Thai
Prime Minister Anand Panyarachun attended the meeting together
with Nepalese government officials, political leaders, leaders of
the business community and trade unions, foreign diplomats and
representatives of international agencies.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the summit, Nepali Prime Minister Girija Prasad
Koirala held that South Asia has the strong potential to become
the most dynamic region in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"South Asian countries have begun to dismantle controls and
open up to world markets. In the process of gradual shift of
economic frontiers supplemented by economic reform programs, South
Asia, with low wage and rising labor productivity, is well
positioned to assume leadership in the next century," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nepal has a unique position in South Asia, he said, adding that
its difficult terrain, tough climatic condition and landlocked
position present a formidable challenge for development.
</P>
<P>
"Eradicating poverty is the most pressing challenge for us, in
fact, this is also the essence of our development efforts," he
added.
</P>
<P>
A background paper presented at the summit by the FNCCI said
though one of the poorest countries in the world with weak and
crumbling socio-economic infrastructure, Nepal enjoys immense
possibilities created by the liberalized atmosphere in the sectors
of agriculture, tourism and service.
</P>
<P>
The FNCCI said in a press release that the summit was organized
to arrive at a national consensus on basic tenets of
socio-economic strategies among various players in the country.
</P>
<P>
FNCCI President Ananda Raj Mulmi said that a group of eminent
persons has been formed to continue the work after the summit to
initiate the strategies formulation process ahead.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the summit, former Bangladeshi President Ershad
called on the richer nations, which will benefit the most in
current globalization, to extend greater access to their markets.
</P>
<P>
Former Thai Prime Minister Panyarachun, whose country was hit
hard by the financial crisis, shared the lessons with the
participants.
</P>
<P>
"What we have learned is that when you take steps toward
greater economic openness, and especially financial openness,
there are a few rules of thumb to bear in mind," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Do let the market do its work of determining prices; do
provide public goods such as education and infrastructure; do
intervene to correct market failures; and do intervene to prevent
private self-interest from damaging the common interest," he
warned.
</P>
<P>
He said that "there are also a few don'ts: Don't second-guess
the market; don't favor certain sectors or groups over others; and
don't use public funds to bail out private mistakes."
</P>
<P>
The strategies to be formulated are scheduled to be submitted
to the new Nepalese government to be formed after the May 3
elections.
</P>
<P>
The FNCCI is an umbrella organization of the Nepalese private
sector.

last hours of bargaining on Saturday, with a possible last-minute
concession by Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources close to the talks said that the Serb and
Kosovo Albanian negotiators had been working overnight on "
political questions" and "minor issues" and were continuing their
talks with the mediators Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
A diplomatic source close to the talks said that the Serbs and
Kosovo Albanians could accept a substantial packages of peace
project presented by the Contact Group in the last minute.
</P>
<P>
They have up to now failed to agree to accept the peace plan
presented to them by the mediators, which mainly includes the
deployment of a NATO-led force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Serbian President Milan Milutinovic returned to the chateau of
Rambouillet after spending one night in Paris, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
France said on Friday that the 15 European Union countries
would consider lifting political and economic sanctions against
Belgrade, if the Yugoslav government accepts the peace plan.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, French Foreign
Minister Hubert Vedrine, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook,
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Avdeyev all arrived here
Saturday morning prior to the expiration of the deadline at 12:00
o'clock local time (1100 GMT) set for the Serbs and Kosovo
Albanians to accept the peace proposal presented by the six-nation
Contact Group.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer has also arrived here
and his Italian counterpart Lamberto Dini will also be here
Saturday morning to attend a meeting of foreign ministers of the
Contact Group after the expiration of the deadline.
</P>
<P>
Serbian sources said that the talks could be extended for at
least 12 hours and that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
would like to have Albright, Vedrine, and Cook fly to Belgrade
before giving a positive response.
</P>
<P>
But the United States, Britain and France issued an ultimatum
on Friday to the Yugoslav government, asking it to accept the
peace plan and allow the deployment of a 30,000-man NATO-led
peacekeeping force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton and French President Jacques Chirac
have ruled out further extension of the Rambouillet talks.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has rejected the
deployment of NATO-led force in Kosovo, considering it as
equivalent to the giving up of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo Liberation Army, an ethnic Albanian separatist
guerrilla, also reject the proposal by the mediators that it be
disarmed by the peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian government indicated on Saturday that a U.N.-
approved peacekeeping force on Kosovo could be acceptable.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton and French President Jacques Chirac
said on Friday in Washington that NATO would strike Serb forces if
the Rambouillet talks collapse.
</P>
<P>
Russia said on Saturday that a deployment of foreign forces
must be approved by the United Nations Security Council and with
the agreement of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement hours before
the ending of Rambouillet talks that an armed foreign force could
be deployed in Kosovo "only with the authorization of the U.N.
Security Council and the agreement of Belgrade."
</P>
<P>
The Serbian President, Milan Milutinovic, also said in an
interview published by the Yugoslav newspaper Politika on Saturday
that a minimum agreement is still possible in Rambouillet.
</P>
<P>
He said that the chance for a compromise could have been larger
if the U.S. mediator Christopher Hill had not adopted an
unacceptable attitude during the talks.
</P>
<P>
Hill insisted that only with a deployment of NATO force could a
political agreement be possible.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian Vice Minister of Information Miodrag Popovic said
in an interview with the BBC on Saturday that Belgrade could
accept the presence of a U.N. force in Kosovo.

ISLAMABAD, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of demonstrators
mainly from the Jammat-i-Islami clashed with police in Lahore,
capital of Pakistan's eastern Punjab province, on Saturday in an
attempt to block the forthcoming summit between the prime
ministers of Pakistan and India.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators took to the streets, blocking roads,
attacking vehicles and stoning shop windows just hours before the
scheduled arrival of Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
The Jammat-i-Islami has called a general strike for Saturday
and vowed to derail the summit between Vajpayee and his Pakistani
counterpart Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the Jammat-i-Islami Qazi Husaain said here Friday
before going to Lahore that Vajpayee will not be allowed to enter
Pakistani soil.
</P>
<P>
In a suburban area of Lahore, police used tear gas to disperse
a crowd of up to 5,000 militants, who had blocked the road and
constructed barriers of burning tires.
</P>
<P>
At least 20 people had been arrested, according to police
sources.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee is due to cross Wagah, a border checkpost Saturday

<HEADLINE> China Soccer Authority Protests at AFC Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 20 (Xinhua) -- China's top soccer official
has sent a letter to the Asia Football Confederation (AFC), urging
them to make a further investigation into the alleged spitting
case of Chinese international Hao Haidong.
</P>
<P>
The AFC disciplinary committte ruled on February 12 that Hao
Haidong, the striker with the four-time China league winner Dalian
Wanda, will be banned a year and fined 2000 U.S. dollars for he
allegedly spitted towards the linesman in the Asian Games in
December.
</P>
<P>
The AFC executive committee endorsed the ban that would take
effect immediately, ruling out Hao in any national or
international events for twelve months.
</P>
<P>
China Football Association (CFA), which also conducted their
own probe into the case, reacted strongly on February 14 on
receiving the fax, protesting that the one-year ban was unfairly
harsh for Hao.
</P>
<P>
Wang Junsheng, CFA general secretary, argued that though Hao
failed to control himself in the fixture against Turkmenistan
during the Bangkok Games, but the evidence available now failed to
show that Hao had committed such serious offenses as spitting at a
linesman.
</P>
<P>
The official said that in accordance with the disciplinary
rules of the FIFA, the world soccer ruling body, the AFC fell
short of evidence to impose the suspension.
</P>
<P>
The letter said that the CFA will file a complaint with the AFC
arbitration committee, calling for the AFC to make their further
probe to make a fair decision.

<HEADLINE> IMF to Renew Aid Program to Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has agreed in principle on a three-year aid program to
Jordan to help alleviate the economic woes of the desert kingdom.
</P>
<P>
IMF and Jordan reached consensus on the framework and elements
of the new program, Jordanian Central Bank Governor Ziyad Fariz
said, quoted by the semiofficial Jordan Times on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Technical committees will continue to meet in both Washington,
where the IMF is based, and Amman to make out the final details,
including the exact level of the IMF assistance, said Jordanian
officials.
</P>
<P>
The package is meant to renew a 10-year loan program due for
the end of this month. The program offered Jordan 331 million
U.S. dollars each year.
</P>
<P>
However, the loan fell short of reducing some economic
pressures on the kingdom which registered a two-digit unemployment
rate and a negative economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The new plan would provide Jordan with an extra 150 million
U.S. dollars a year to help bring the budget deficit down to its
projected 7 percent of the 1999 gross domestic product (GDP), or
435 million dinars (609 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government also hoped the new IMF aid package to
help the kingdom achieve a 4-percent economic growth by the end of
a three-year period.
</P>
<P>
The year 1998 witnessed a negative economic growth in Jordan,
the worst economic performance since the 1989 Gulf crisis, said
independent economists.

<HEADLINE> Turkish, Syrian People Allowed Meet at Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Long-standing rivals Turkey
and Syria have agreed to allow their citizens to meet in border
areas on holidays, the Daily News reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Under a protocol signed Friday, Syrian and Turkish citizens
will be able to meet at previously determined points.
</P>
<P>
The move was completely "humanitarian", and should not be
interpreted as a sign of a thaw in the chilly Turco-Syrian
relations, said a Turkish Foreign Ministry official, who asked not
to be named.
</P>
<P>
Relatives living on the opposite sides of the Turco-Syrian
border used to meet behind barbed wires on holidays.
</P>
<P>
People trying to touch each others' hands, pelting presents
over the barbed wires and soldiers preventing them from entering
the opposite side have been the subject of emotional television
footage during every holiday.
</P>
<P>
The tension between Turkey and Syria reached its peak in
September when Turkey claimed that it would launch military
attacks on Syria if it continued to support the outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK) and shelter its leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan reportedly left Syria on October 9. Several days later,
Ankara and Damascus signed an agreement under which Syria pledged
to stop supporting the PKK.

ISLAMABAD, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz Saturday expressed the support for China's efforts for
the establishment of a multi-polar world.
</P>
<P>
Aziz further said that "there should be a new, just and
equitable international economic order and a reform of the

Chairman of China's Central Military Commission.

issue of Taiwan, human rights and Tibet and hoped that Pak-China
strategic friendship would be further strengthened in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the qualitative change brought about by the
security situation in south Asia, Aziz underlined the need of
resolving the Jammu and Kashmir issue which might become a
possible nuclear flash point.
</P>
<P>
He called upon the international community to remain actively
engaged in efforts to find solution to the core issue of Jammu and
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Aziz noted with satisfaction the cooperation and friendly ties
between the armed forces of Pakistan and China and expressed the

including the defense and security.
</P>
<P>
General Chi, who is also the State Councilor and Minister of
National Defense, reaffirmed that the Chinese government would
continue to strive for promotion of cordial and mutually
beneficial ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that his current visit would further
strengthen the existing friendly, time-tested relations between
the two countries and their armed forces, and would result in
further enhancement of cooperation in the defense field.
</P>
<P>
General Chi said that China is opposed to policies of
hegemonism and dominance.

<P>
Appreciating Pakistan's efforts to hold a substantive dialogue

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Establish Modern Railway in Mindanao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The development of the southern
Philippines will get a boost with the establishment of a modern
railway system linking north and south Mindanao by the year 2006,
the government said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, the presidential palace said that a
2,000-kilometer Mindanao Railway System (MRS) is one of the vital
infrastructure projects of the government to hasten economic
productivity and improve the livelihood of both Muslim and
Christian residents in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The 2,000-kilometer stretch will cover key cities such as
Iligan, Cagayan de Oro, Davao, Butuan, General Santos, Dipolog and
Zamboanga in the Mindanao region, it said.
</P>
<P>
The palace said that aside from the economic impact the railway
project will bring, the railway can contribute to the development
of the local tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the railway will start in 2003 and complete
by 2006, it said.

<P>
ABU DHABI, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The number of Qataris in
government service rose to 22,079 in 1998, up 5.9 percent from
20,846 in the previous year, the United Arab Emirates' Gulf News
reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The growth is considered as the result of the state's
Qatarization drive, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from Qatar's Ministry of Civil Service Affairs and
Housing show that the number of expatriates holding middle level
posts declined to 15,435 from 15,569, Arab expatriates to 7,167
from 7,224 and non-Arabs to 8,268 from 8,345.
</P>
<P>
Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad ordered in 1998 that all government
departments and fully or partially state-owned institutions and
banks to guarantee that a minimum of 20 percent of their employees
are Qataris.
</P>
<P>
And the Ministry of Civil Affairs is working on programs to
train Qataris to handle various categories of jobs in the public
as well as private sectors.
</P>
<P>
The health sector has achieved maximum Qatarization with 90
percent of its staff being Qatari citizens.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni's brother Salim Saleh, who admitted buying Uganda
Commercial Bank (UCB) through illegal means at the beginning of
this year, has divested his interests in more than 20 enterprises
he owns.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued Saturday, Saleh said he has promised
to sell his shares to his employees on credit.
</P>
<P>
His decision coincides with the 15th anniversary of the
invasion and capture of Masindi Barracks in northern Uganda in
1984, a battle he commanded, he added.
</P>
<P>
His employees will buy his companies out of their own
productivity, he said, explaining that his move is to ensure the
continuity of the business and encourage individual share
ownership by Ugandans.
</P>
<P>
Concentration of ownership leads to abuse and decentralization
of ownership leads to democracy in the work place, and ultimately
the country's politics.
</P>
<P>
Saleh, who resigned as senior presidential advisor on defense
and security after admitting his purchasing the UCB through
illegal means, is now one of the wealthiest businessmen in Uganda.
 He is said to take commission when purchasing helicopters for the
army.
</P>
<P>
As a major general and former state minister for defense, he is
 allegedly engaged in gold business from the Democratic Republic
of Congo and there has been a loud outcry to punish him for his
wrongdoings.

NAIROBI, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has

the world just two days after their closure following attacks by
Kurdish activists over the arrest of their leader Abdullah Ocalan.

attacks from angry Kurds was still real.

<HEADLINE> WFP Approves Food Aid to Great Lakes Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 20 (Xinhua) --- The United Nations World Food
Program (WFP) has approved a 270-million-U.S. Dollar worth of
emergency food aid program for the war-ravaged Great Lakes
region, according to a new release available here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The two-year operation will be launched in August 1999,
providing a total of 422,000 metric tons of food aid to about
1.25 million war-affected people per month in Burundi, Rwanda,
Tanzania and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
This will be one of the agency's largest operations in the world
and the second largest in Africa, following its massive food
distribution program in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
"The ongoing problems in this region continue to shatter the
lives of thousands of people everyday," said Allen Jones, WFP's
regional manager for the Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
"Insecurity is driving many families from their homes,
devastating the region's agricultural productivity and leaving
large groups of people dependent on food aid for their survival,"
said Jones.
</P>
<P>
The majority of beneficiaries are some 770,000 refugees and
displaced persons based in Burundi, Rwanda, and Tanzania.
Assistance will also be delivered to 280,000 former refugees and
displaced people who have returned to their home areas, but are
not yet fully self-sufficient.
</P>
<P>
A contingency has also been included to allow another 200,000
persons to receive food assistance, since new population
displacements in the region are constantly creating additional
needs.
</P>
<P>
"Many of these people are already receiving our help," said
Jones. "What we are doing with this new program is consolidating
the methods of implementation, which will make the distribution
of food more efficient over the long term."
</P>
<P>
WFP is committed to assisting vulnerable people living in the
Great Lakes region. The governments of this region are among the
poorest in the world, lacking the resources to deal with the
tough task of providing such large amounts of relief aids.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Train Muslim Students Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
announced Saturday that it will send abroad 100 Muslims from
Mindanao each year for graduate studies in order to train future
leaders for the south.
</P>
<P>
The government hopes to send 600 Muslim Filipinos for
post-graduate training abroad in the next six years, the
presidential palace said in a statement issued here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The move can not only train future leaders for Mindanao, but
can ensure that the battle against poverty will be won by a highly
literate citizenry, it said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the palace said, the government will grant 1,000
scholarship slots to deserving Muslims in Mindanao for the next 10
years, or 100 scholars from the south per year from 1999 to 2009.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that the government plan is aimed at
persuading Muslim rebels in Mindanao to abandon their demand for
an independent Muslim state in the south.
</P>
<P>
Muslim rebels have complained that the government has not paid
due attention to the development in Mindanao in the past 20 years.

MOSCOW, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Soyuz TM-29 spacecraft,
with a three-member crew from Russia, France and Slovakia, blasted
off Saturday on the 27th, and possibly last, expedition to the Mir
space station.
</P>
<P>
The craft, launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan
at 04:17 GMT, will dock with Mir at 05:37 GMT next Monday, the
Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The crew, comprising commander Viktor Afanasyev of Russia,
flight engineers Jean-Pierre Haignere of France and Ivan Bella of
Slovakia, could be the last for the Mir space station, which marks
its 13th anniversary Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a sign of financial pinch, two of the crew were fare paying
foreigners. Slovakia is writing off 20 million U.S. dollars of
debt in exchange for Bella's flight, and France is paying 20.6
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Officials are desperately seeking private funds to keep the Mir
complex in orbit beyond August, when the new crew returns to earth.
It costs 200-250 million dollars a year to keep Mir aloft.
</P>
<P>
By sending up two foreigners, Russia has in effect sold off the
place on the cramped three-seat Soyuz capsule usually reserved for
the flight engineer, the top technical specialist on board.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Sergei Avdeyev, who has already spent six months
in orbit, will stay for another half a year and return in August
with Afanasyev and Haignere.
</P>
<P>
Bella will return to Earth after eight days with outgoing
commander Gennady Padalka.
</P>
<P>
Haignere, a 50-year-old air force pilot, plans two space walks
during his mission to install and remove instruments for
scientific experiment from Mir's exterior.
</P>
<P>
Afanasyev, also 50, is on his third mission to Mir.

Al-Ahram:

<HEADLINE> Albright Arrives in France for Kosovo Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright arrived here early Saturday in an attempt to
prevent the Kosovo peace talks from collapsing before the deadline
of 11:00 GMT on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
She will first be briefed by U.S. chief mediator Christopher
Hill in Paris after her arrival. Hill returned earlier on Friday
after being snubbed by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic who
rejected NATO's demand for deployment of peacekeeping troops in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Later, Albright will travel to Rambouillet, France, to meet
Serbs and Kosovo ethnic Albanians to assess the ongoing peace
talks, according to a U.S. official in Washington.
</P>
<P>
"Beyond that everything is in flux," including how or when
NATO would take the decision to make good on its threats to bomb
Yugoslav targets if the peace talks between the Serbs and ethnic
Albanians break down without any agreement, the official said.
</P>
<P>
There is a possibility Albright could go to NATO headquarters
in Brussels for a meeting, but that has not been decided. "There'
s no requirement for a NATO meeting" before the air strikes,
another U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
The officials did not rule out a trip to Belgrade by Albright
to make a last-minute effort to persuade Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to accept a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
The officials said there were quite a lot of things that had
been agreed between the Serbs and Kosovo ethnic Albanians. But
NATO's demand to deploy its troops in Kosovo to implement a peace
deal was still the major outstanding issue.

</P>
<P>
"Pakistan is grateful to China for its understanding and
sensitivity over Pakistan's security concerns," he added. Sharif
welcomed Chinese investments in various fields, especially in high
technology areas.
</P>

General Chi reaffirmed that the Chinese government would
continue to work for promotion of mutually beneficial relations
between the two countries.
</P>

China viewed the China-Pak friendship as time-tested and a
permanent feature of China's foreign policy, said Chi, adding that
the two countries had stood by each other in weal and woe and
would continue to do so in the future.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese General expressed the hope that his visit to
Pakistan would further bring the two countries closer and enhance
their understanding on various regional and international issues.
</P>
<P>
He appreciated Pakistan's support for a multipolar world and
expressed understanding for Pakistan's concerns for its security.
</P>
<P>
General Chi assured Sharif that China would continue to attach
great importance to its relations with its old friend, Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> Cholera Claims 57 Lives in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The cholera epidemic has so far
claimed 57 lives in Zimbabwe with a total of 446 people having
been infected, the daily Herald reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare as
saying that of the 57, 19 died while being treated at clinics and
hospitals while the rest died at their homes.
</P>
<P>
Mashonaland East in east Zimbabwe recorded the highest number
of cases, followed by Mashonaland Central province, in the
northeast.
</P>
<P>
Other areas which have been affected include Matabeleland North
in the west and Harare urban, in the northeast.
</P>
<P>
It is feared that the disease could spread fast to other towns
if people failed to take the necessary preventive measures.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to stop the spread of the disease, the government
has banned unauthorized gatherings.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health and Child Welfare is appealing to the
government and the private sector to complement its efforts by
creating awareness and giving appropriate support.
</P>
<P>
The outbreak of cholera in Harare has forced the city council
to step up refuse collection in high-density areas where no
collections have been made in the past three weeks.
</P>
<P>
The council's public relations manager Giles Kuimba said Friday
efforts were being made to collect refuse in all areas so as to
avoid a major outbreak.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Denies Aiding Ocalan Kidnappers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has
denied that Turkish commandos used Uganda as a base to net a top
dissident Abdullah Ocalan who was kidnapped in Nairobi, Kenya
Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Friday night, Ugandan International
Affairs Minister Tom Butime said the government had no hand in the
arrest of Ocalan and was not even aware of his whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
He also refuted allegations that as soon as the Turkish plane
landed at Entebbe International Airport, 45 km south of Kampala,
both the crew and passengers were received by members of the
Uganda Marines and taken to an unknown plane.
</P>
<P>
Friday's New Vision paper said the French-built Falcon 900
plane which was believed to carry the kidnapped Ocalan from
Nairobi to Turkey was on standby at Entebbe Airport for five days
beforehand.
</P>
<P>
Butime said he was not aware of the aircraft's flight to
Uganda, nor knew the motive of its mission. But he ordered his
men to make some inquiries, he added.
</P>
<P>
Following Ocalan's arrest, his supporters attacked Greek and
Kenyan embassies abroad. The Kenyan government had ordered
closure of all its 37 embassies outside the country.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Kenya's top police and immigration chiefs were
fired by President Daniel arap Moi in a surprise cabinet
reshuffle. But it is still unknown whether the sackings had
anything to do with Ocalan's capture in Nairobi.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt Backs Profit-Sharing For Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said here Saturday that he backs a profit-sharing scheme
for workers to help them earn more and promote industrial peace.
</P>
<P>
In a radio program, Estrada said that instead of abolishing the
minimum wage law, his government will push a measure which could
give workers additional income through a profit-sharing scheme
with their employers.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to reports that his government is eyeing the abolition
of the minimum wage law and the right of workers to strike,
Estrada said that the granting of the minimum wage is embodied in
a law which even the president cannot remove.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, the government prefers a profit-sharing scheme
that would allow workers to get involved in a company affairs and
in the process get a share of the profit.
</P>
<P>
The government is working hard to attract foreign investors by
promoting industrial peace through a social accord, because
investors are afraid of strikes, Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign investors are afraid of strikes, that's why we are
trying to enhance the relations between laborers and employers so
labor will have a stake in corporations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last November, the government pushed for the signing by
organized labor and major employers' groups of an accord that aims
to prevent strikes, lockouts and lay-offs.

<HEADLINE> IT Industry Unlikely to Be Hit by Oil Slump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 20 (Xinhua) -- One industry that is not
likely to be hit by the oil price slump in the region is the
information technology (IT) or computers industry.
</P>
<P>
The drop in oil prices has led to a cost-cutting exercise by
companies who are increasingly turning to improve technology
thereby reducing costs, according to a report by Gulf News on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Businesses will use technology and computers to resolve the
issue of increasing costs as IT offers several benefits," Derek
Kerr, Microsoft Gulf's business development manager, was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"The drop in oil prices is thus good for the IT industry," Kerr
added.
</P>
<P>
Kerr and other Microsoft officials who are conducting the
second Open Door seminars in the Middle East countries are
focusing on the Year 2000, sharing information on the millennium
bug challenge and system compliance as well as giving help to
partners in approaching the problem.
</P>
<P>
The Year 2000 issue has given the IT industry a boost in terms
of consultancy services but according to Kerr it is only a blip on
growth which will taper off after a period of time.
</P>
<P>
"It seems like a false peak for the industry," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kerr said Open Door is the largest project of its kind in the
Middle East covering 11 countries in its current second series.
It is dedicated to IT professionals, developers, technical and
sales managers, owners and business decision makers in the
region.

HARARE, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Over 400 Rebels of the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) were either killed or captured
following their ill- fated offensive against Southern African
Development Community (SADC) allied forces earlier this week, said
the SADC task force headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The Herald newspaper Saturday quoted the headquarters as saying
that the rebels and their backers launched a major offensive in
the northern and eastern parts of the DRC this week, in an attempt
to regain some of the towns and areas they lost to allied forces
following fierce battles in the central African country.
</P>
<P>
The headquarters said the invading forces had "met with dire
consequences in the northern and eastern parts of the DRC" in the
past few days.
</P>
<P>
"The enemy suffered heavy casualties in combined allied forces
air and ground operations at Akula, Ikela, Kalanda, Kabalo, Kiambi
and Moba. Over 400 invading troops were either killed or captured
on all the fronts. Among those killed were some white mercenaries
in the Kabalo area," it said.
</P>
<P>
"Attempts by the invading forces to gain more territory have
been completely frustrated, as the allied forces' military power
dominated the battle theatre," the headquarters said.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's External Trade Continues to Shrink Last Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's total external
trade continued to shrink in January 1999, registering a hefty
12.7 percent decline compared to the same month of 1998 and
reflecting depressed regional economic conditions and continued
weakness in global demand for electronics and related products,
the Trade Development Board (TDB) of Singapore said in a press
release Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The overall non-oil domestic exports remained weak as it
contracted by 5.9 percent in January 1999 with domestic
electronics exports dipping by 5.3 percent and non-electronic
exports sinking by 7.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil re-export (NORX) saw a hefty 13.8 percent decline in
January 1999 with that to the U.S. and the EU dropping by
double-digit rates of 10.9 percent and 12.1 percent respectively.
In December 1998, NORX recorded a 12.8 percent plunge.
</P>
<P>
Oil domestic exports fell by 7.0 percent in January 1999 as
compared to the double-digit declines in the past 12 months. TDB
said the rebound was mainly due to the strong demand from Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Of Singapore's top five markets, only the EU market managed to
expand marginally while that to other four markets -- the U.S.,
Malaysia, Japan and Hong Kong -- shrank.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil imports continued to decline in January 1999, by 15.6
percent.

<HEADLINE> Flowers Blossoming in Plateau City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- It is still in winter in this
plateau city some 3,700 meters above sea level, but flowers
blossoming on balconies of apartment buildings and in Lamaist
temples are suggesting an air of warm spring.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, cultivating potted flowers at home or buying flowers
to be sent as gifts has become a new fashion in Lhasa, capital of
the Tibet Autonomous Region, and you can see blossoming flowers
and green plants nearly everywhere in the city.
</P>
<P>
"Growing a pot of flower is like lighting a butter lamp in
front of the Budda, and it means boundless beneficence," said a
lama in Johkang Temple, a major religious cemter in the city.
</P>
<P>
His idea is shared by other lamas who believe flowers can
refresh the environment and adding fragrance to the shrine.
</P>
<P>
Zhangdaren Flower is one of the most popular flower species
here. It is said that it was introduced to Tibet by a Han official
sent by the Qing Imperial Court 300 years ago. In the past, the
flower was a noble thing, which meant only serf owners had the
right to grow it.
</P>
<P>
Enjoying flower fragrance at home, Bama, a native tibetan,
feels refreshed. In his sitting room, two dozens of potted
colorful Zhoima flowers have been in blossom since the Tibetan New
Year (starting on February 17). The 58-year old former serf said,
"I love flower fragrance. My live is beautiful, because I can
smell the fragrance at home even in winter."
</P>
<P>
As the economy is booming in Tibet, the local people are busy
catching up with all fashion trends. On the Sante Valentine's Day
on February 14, fresh flowers nearly ran short of supply in
flower shops. A lover would spare no money to buy an expensive
bounch of rose to his girl friend.
</P>
<P>
Many business people have noticed the trend of the profitable
business. Wei Yan and her husband came here last year to find
their fortune from Chengdu, capital of neighboring Sichuan
Province. They contracted a piece of land in the city's suburban
area, where they set up a flower greenhouse to grow several
hundred flower strains. They have scored good returns for the
first year of their undertaking.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government is
trying to create an environment where Bengali culture and heritage
can flourish without interruptions by bigots, an English daily
newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said this while addressing the
reunion program of Chhayanaut, a major and old cultural
organization of the country, here Friday, the Bangladesh Observer
said.
</P>
<P>
"Out target is to develop the country on all fronts, including
literature and culture, so that the nation could take its place in
the world arena with due honor and dignity," she said.
</P>
<P>
The government had already taken a number of steps for
advancement of Bengali civilization and culture, she said, adding
that the government had implemented 16 development projects in the
cultural sector while 24 others were awaiting approval.
</P>
<P>
Hasina also noted that the government is constructing academic
units in every district town in a bid to spread exercise of
culture to every corner of the country and taking step to leave a
rich cultural heritage for the next generation.

<HEADLINE> China Upgrades Border Patrol Equipment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 20 (Xinhua) -- China is conducting the
largest ever construction drive in the border areas in a bid to
improve telecom facilities, patrol equipment and the cultural life
of frontier guards.
</P>
<P>
With funds allocated by the central government, border guards
have built high-grade patrol roads with a total length of 5,000 km,
set up 1,500-km wire-fense walls and installed stakes and
monitoring facilities along its borders.
</P>
<P>
To clear mines along the Sino-Vietnamese border, frontier
troops in southwest China's Yunnan Province and the Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region launched the second mine-removing campaign last
November.
</P>
<P>
To date, soldiers have removed 66,500 mines on 120 square
kilometers. Two ports of entry andd exit and 3,300 ha of
cultivated land have been built in the place, said an officer from
the Headquarters of the General staff of the People's Liberation
Army. "All mines will be removed from the border areas by the end
of this year," he added.
</P>
<P>
Troops in Guangxi have cleared 91 mine zones and turned 2,700
ha of farmland to local farmers for agricultural use.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Chinese border troops are now equipped with
computer-controlled or remote telephones and helicopters. Medical
and cultural facilities at border areas have greatly been improved
as well.

<HEADLINE> Indian PM to Visit Pakistan by Bus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee is scheduled to cross the Indo-Pakistan border
from the country's border city Amritsar, 447 km northwest of New
Delhi, at 16:30 p.m. (local time) Saturday by bus to pay a visit
to Pakistan's second biggest city Lahore.
</P>
<P>
He will be received by his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif
at Pakistan's border point Wagah and then they will fly together
to Lahore, capital of Pakistan Punjab's province, by helicopter.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee will be the first Indian prime minister in the past
over five decades to visit Pakistan by bus. And it is also the
first time in the past 10 years for an Indian prime minister to go
to Pakistan and talk with the Pakistan leaders. Former Indian
prime minister Rajiv Gandhi visited that country in 1989.
</P>
<P>
India and Pakistan signed a formal agreement for launching the
New Delhi-Lahore bus service in Pakistan's capital Islamabad on
February 17 and it will be inaugurated by Vajpayee when he travels
on its maiden run to Lahore on February 20.
</P>
<P>
The decision to introduce the bus service was taken by the two
prime ministers when they met in New York in September 1998 to
increase interaction between the two countries and peoples.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Lahore, Vajpayee will hold talks with Sharif
on the whole range of subjects including the Kashmir issue, which
have affected their relations.
</P>
<P>
Both the countries have expressed their desire to solve their
outstanding problems so as to create an environment of peace and
security between them.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said on February 17 that confrontation between India and
Pakistan would not solve outstanding problems. And Vajpayee has
said that he would go to Pakistan with an "open mind".
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement in September 1998, the two prime ministers
reaffirmed their common belief that "an environment of durable
peace and security was in the supreme interests of both India and
Pakistan, and the region as a whole."
</P>
<P>
India and Pakistan have gone to war three times and small
border skirmishes have often been reported between them since
their division in 1947. Their main dispute is over Kashmir.

<HEADLINE> Bank of Thailand Figures Confirm Recession in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Figures released by the Bank
of Thailand (BOT) showed that local consumption and investment in
Thailand dropped dramatically in 1998 from a year ago, reflecting
the country's economic havoc.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's figures available here Saturday reported
that local consumption fell by 13 percent in 1998 while investment
contracted by 39.4 percent, leading to a higher unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
The trade account in 1998 was estimated to show a growth rate
of 10 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), or 11.5 billion
U.S. dollars, compared to a three percent reduction a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
The current account in 1998 was expected to be 13.5 billion
dollars, or 11.5 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
According to the figures, which are to be submitted to the
government next week, private consumption plunged by 14.2 percent
against an increase of 0.2 percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The estimated public sector consumption rate in 1998 dipped by
4.7 percent compared to a fall of 0.7 percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
After a significant slump in the investment rate, which dropped
by 16 percent in 1997, the BOT estimated that the 1998 investment
index would be lower by as much as 39.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
This dramatic contraction was largely due to the private
sector, down by 50 percent last year compared to a fall of 24.8
percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
In the public sector, investment contracted by 17 percent in
1998 compared to a growth of 11.3 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The BOT said the sharp decline in the investment index was due
mainly to the reduction in the size of the consumer-lending
portfolio of financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the decline in total sales from department stores,
the auto industry and imported goods also indicated a negative
trend in the consumption index.
</P>
<P>
The central bank also said that the sharp decline in last
year's productivity index had resulted in the current level of
excess production capacity.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, productivity in the agriculture sector expanded by 2.1
percent compared to an increase of 1.4 percent a year ago. This
growth was largely due to a 3.8 percent productivity upturn in the
fishery sector.
</P>
<P>
The added value of goods from the industrial sector was
estimated to have shrunk by 9.4 percent against a rise of 0.2
percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The country's total exports in 1998 were estimated at 53
billion dollars, down from the 1997 figure of 56.7 billion
dollars. Imports were also lower at 41.5 billion dollars against
61.3 billion dollars a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry is negotiating with the representatives of
the International Monetary Fund on the seventh quarterly review of
the country's economy, which is expected to highlight measures to
stimulate domestic consumption.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Import Buses, Engine Kits from India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka will import 200
small buses and 500 engine kits from India, at a cost of over 500
million rupees (7.25 million U.S. dollars) to augment the bus

</P>
<P>
These buses and engine kits have already been ordered from

depots, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The Transport and Highways Ministry earlier also imported 500
small buses at a cost of 550 million rupees (8 million dollars) to
augment the rural bus services which have been neglected over the
last ten years.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 200 buses, the ministry has also made
arrangements to purchase 50 big buses from the local bus market
within two months.

TIRANA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Albania's most profitable

</P>
<P>
The transformation represents the first step towards
privatization, which, according to a plan drafted by the ministry,
will start in the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
ALBATELEKOM will be the second enterprise in the strategic
sector of the Albanian economy to be privatized.
</P>
<P>
Before the transformation, Telecom signed in Washington an

<HEADLINE> New Analysis: Yen's Depreciation Likely to Batter S.Korean Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese yen's sudden
depreciation against the U.S. dollar is likely to deal a blow to
South Korea's economy.
</P>
<P>
At the Tokyo market, the yen traded at 119.75 against the
dollar Friday, down 1.06 from the previous day.
</P>
<P>
Due to the yen's fall, the South Korean won fell to 1,200
against the dollar Friday afternoon, down 18.10 won from Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the share prices at the Seoul stock market also
tumbled Friday, the second day in a row, with the key index losing
2.65 percent to 522.18 points after a 2.78 percent decline
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, whose economy has just began recovery and is
highly dependent on exports, is concerned with the yen's rapid
depreciation could deal a severe blow to its export performance,
which has been in trouble since the financial crisis in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's export products, such as automobiles, electronics,
and steel, all of which are the nation's key export items
competing with Japanese goods in world markets, will lose their
price competitiveness, said analysts.
</P>
<P>
The yen's decline was prompted by the Japanese government's
policy shift toward invigorating the business cycle in bid to
overcome nine-year old business slowdown by lowering market
interest rates and liquidity expansion.
</P>
<P>
Economists said Japan is seeking to increase money supply to
recover its business activity even at the risk of inflation.
</P>
<P>
So Japan is likely to float national bonds and bond prices will
drop and long-term interest rates will rise.
</P>
<P>
South Korea market experts forecasted that the yen will devalue
further to the level of 120-130 yen against the greenback in the
coming days.
</P>
<P>
Some of them even don't rule out the possibility that the U.S.
dollar will rally to above the 150-yen level by the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
If and when the yen continues to fall, the South Korean won
should be devalued, they said.
</P>
<P>
However, observers said the rapid depreciation of the yen will
have little effect on South Korean exports as the won is being
flexibly floated.

<HEADLINE> Air Lanka Native Pilots' Strike Called Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan pilots working in
Air Lanka, who went on strike Friday demanding equal pay with
foreign pilots, agreed to return to work Saturday, according to
informed sources here.
</P>
<P>
The strike has arisen due to a scheme to increase salary of
foreign pilots by 1,300 U.S. dollars and salary of Sri Lankan
pilots by a small margin.
</P>
<P>
Air Lanka's management, officials of the Ministry of Aviation
and Executive Committee members of the Pilot's Guild began
discussions at noon Friday to resolve the situation, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
They reached an agreement on a course of action which enabled
Air Lanka to operate flights once again, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
At Present, there are 100 Sri Lankan pilots and 25 foreign
pilots serving in Air Lanka. Foreign pilots earn around 7,000 U.S.
dollars a month while local pilots get only one third of it.
</P>
<P>
Due to the strike the airline's scheduled fights to Paris,
Frankfurt, Singapore, Male and Trichy were delayed on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar's Tachilek Airport Upgraded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 20 (Xinhua) -- A new runway and modern
terminal of the Tachilek Airport in eastern Shan state of Myanmar
bordering Thailand was opened Friday to expand the domestic air
services.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Chairman of the Myanmar State Peace and Development
Council General Maung Aye inaugurated the airport, official The
New Light of Myanmar newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Upgraded by the May Flower Trading Co Ltd, a local private
enterprise, the new airport has a runway of 2,115 meters long and
30 meters wide, and the extended area was built to take in flights
of Fokker F-28 aircraft and the apron is 90 meters by 30 meters,
large enough for three Fokker F-27 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The company started undertaking the project in September 1997
and completed it last month.
</P>
<P>
The Tachilek Airport was first built in the post-independence
period with a granite-paved runway with 570 meters in length and
22.5 meters in width for light planes of the Myanmar Air Force,
while the old terminal was just a 12 meters by 6 meters building.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a new modern terminal and a new runway for landing
of Boeing 737 aircraft of Myanmar's Kawthoung Airport in southern
Tanintharyi division bordering Thailand were also commissioned
into service earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
There are 43 air fields under the Department of Civil Aviation
of Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, a total of 900,000 passengers
were transported on the domestic routes in the 1997-98 fiscal year
by the state-run Myanma Airways and other joint venture airlines
such as Air Mandalay and Yangon Airways.
</P>
<P>
Construction of new Hanthawaddy International Airport in Bago
division, 80 kilometers away from Yangon, and Mandalay
International Airport, 680 km from the capital, are underway,
while upgrading of the Yangon International Airport is being
carried out.

<HEADLINE> Albright Flies to Paris for Kosovo Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright on Friday left here for Paris in an attempt to
prevent the Kosovo peace talks collapsing before the deadline of
11:00 GMT on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
She will first be briefed by U.S. chief mediator Christopher
Hill in Paris after her arrival. Hill returned earlier on Friday
after being snubbed by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic who
rejected NATO's demand for deployment of peacekeeping troops in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Later, Albright will travel to Rambouillet, France, to meet
Serbs and Kosovo ethnic Albanians to assess the ongoing peace
talks, according to a U.S. official.
</P>
<P>
"Beyond that everything is in flux," including how or when NATO
would take the decision to make good on its threats to bomb
Yugoslav targets if the peace talks between the Serbs and ethnic
Albanians break down without any agreement, the official said.
</P>
<P>
There is a possibility Albright could go to NATO headquarters
in Brussels for a meeting, but that has not been decided. "There's
no requirement for a NATO meeting" before the air strikes, another
official said.
</P>
<P>
The officials did not rule out a trip to Belgrade by Albright
to make a last-minute effort to persuade Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to accept a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
The officials said there were quite a lot of things that had
been agreed between the Serbs and Kosovo ethnic Albanians. But
NATO's demand to deploy its troops in Kosovo to implement a peace
deal was still the major outstanding issue.

<P>
MANILA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' current
account yielded a surplus of 928 million U.S. dollars in the first
11 months of 1998, a dramatic reversal of the 4.4 billion dollar
deficit incurred in the previous year, according to an official
report Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It was the best posted by the country in more than 10 years.
The last time the Central Bank of the Philippines posted a current
account surplus was in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
In a report published here Saturday, the central bank said that
the strong current account position resulted in a balance of
payment surplus of 1.2 billion dollars during that period.
</P>
<P>
The current account consists of the balance of trade in goods
and services as well as foreign transfers.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson said that behind the
trend was the 95.4 percent reduction in the trade-in-goods deficit
to only 488 million dollars from the previous year's shortfall of
10.6 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said that the current account surplus of 928 million dollars
stood 375 million dollars higher than the projected 553 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
It already surpassed the full-year target of 786 million
dollars, he added.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that the strong current account position could
help the central bank stabilize the country's currency, which has
been traded around 39 pesos to a dollar in the past two months.

JAKARTA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's oil and gas
revenue in 1998/99 fiscal year (ending on March 31) is expected to
fall 19 percent below the original forecast, a senior official
said.
</P>
<P>
Revenue is seen falling to 40.3 trillion rupiah (one U.S.

trillion rupiah, Mine and Energy Minister Kuntoro Mangkusubroto
said here Friday evening.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government on Friday
declared a state of emergency in Rome and its environs as
preparations for the city's millennial Holy year celebrations when
tens of millions of visitors are expected to arrive in the city.
</P>
<P>
The governmental statement said that the measure was related to
problems of waste disposal while the visitors are in the city.
</P>
<P>
Precise estimates of how many visitors are expected to arrive
in Rome for the Holy Year vary wildly. The Holy Year celebrations
will start at midnight on December 24 of this year and last until
January 6 in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The government said extraordinary measures would be taken to
help keep the situation under control. It was not immediately
clear what emergency measures would be invoked, nor whether the
state of emergency also concerns the major civil engineering works
currently under construction.
</P>
<P>
It was reported Friday by the Italian news agency ANSA that a
special commissioner would be appointed by the government shortly
with special powers only for the building and management of waste
and garbage disposal and handling facilities.
</P>
<P>
A parliamentary committee estimated that the extra visitors for
the Holy year will produce 300 tons of extra waste each day, with
high points of 600 tons. The special commissioner would be able
to speed up the stalled waste facility construction program in
Rome and the surrounding region.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Military Denies Prabowo's Coup Attempt Last May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Armed Forced
(ABRI) denied allegations that former head of the Army Strategic
Reserves Command Lieut. Gen. Prabowo Subianto launched a coup
attempt in May 1998, the Indonesian Observer daily reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The gathering of troops in several places around Jakarta,
capital of Indonesia, including the area near the residence of
President B.J. Habibie, one day after the handover of the
presidential post on May 22 1998, was not 'troop concentration',
but a 'consolidation'," ABRI spokesman Maj. Gen. Syamsul Ma'arif
said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
President Habibie last week told a meeting of Asian-German
editors that Prabowo, a son-in-law of former president Soeharto,
deployed his troops to several strategic places in Jakarta on May
22, 1998.
</P>
<P>
It was ABRI Commander General Wiranto who reported the troop
movements to the president. Then, Habibie said to Wiranto that "he
(Prabowo) should withdraw the troops."
</P>
<P>
Prabowo, meanwhile, said Friday the deployment of troops
between May 12 and May 22 1998 was aimed at merely safeguarding
"objects of importance," including the safety of the president.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement read out by his close friends Farid
Prawiranegara and Fadli Zon here, Prabowo said the movement was
conducted based on procedures and was completely under the control
of the then operating commander -- the Jakarta military commander.
</P>
<P>
Made in Amman, Jordan, the statement was dated February 19. It
was Prabowo's official response and constituted clarification of
his role in the deployment of troops in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was forced to step down in May 1998 amid the country's
worst political and economic crisis in decades. On the same day.
Habibie took office.
</P>
<P>
From May 13 to 15, violence took place in Jakarta and some
other
cities.
</P>
<P>
After the resignation of Soeharto who ruled the country for 32
years,
 Jakarta was then overwhelmed by rumors of coup attempt by the
military.
</P>
<P>
Prabowo was dismissed from his military duty months afterwards
on account of his alleged involvement in the kidnapping of
political activities.
</P>
<P>
Some reports said earlier, Prabowo and some other high-ranking
officers also involved in the May riots and rapes.
</P>
<P>
Prabowo has been reportedly living in Amman to represent the
business
interests of his brother Hashim.

<P>
KIEV, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian parliament, the
Supreme Council, adopted a statement on Friday to firmly denounce
NATO threats to resolve the Kosovo crisis by force.
</P>
<P>
The statement, passed at an emergency meeting, claimed that
NATO was blackmailing Yugoslavia by attempting to send troops to
the Yugoslavian province of Kosovo. The troop deployment would
violate the territorial integrity of an independent state and
would provoke an armed conflict in Central Europe, it said.
</P>
<P>
The parliament asked the U.N. Security Council and parliaments
and governments of the world to make all efforts to prevent the
conflict, "which may finally develop into a world war", from
taking place.
</P>
<P>
The parliament appealed for the Serbs and Kosovo ethnic
Albanians, now sitting at the negotiating table at Rambouillet,
France, to settle their problems through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
The United States and NATO threatened once again on Thursday
that if the Serbs and ethnic Albanians in Kosovo failed to reach a
peace deal by the deadline of 11:00 GMT on Saturday, NATO would
launch air strikes on Yugoslavia immediately.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Prime Minister Pandeli
Majko warned Friday that a failure to reach an agreement at the
Rambouillet peace talks on Kosovo would destabilize the region.
</P>
<P>
A breakdown in the talks "would cause instability in the region,
which is not in Albania's interests at all", the prime minister
stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said his government was "interested in resolving the Kosovo
crisis and respecting the will of its people" and "has engaged
fully its diplomatic potential for the sake of peace in the region
".
</P>
<P>
Majko met with Foreign Ministry officials early on Friday to
discuss the role of Albanian diplomacy in the decisive moment when
peace talks between the Serbs and ethnic Albanians in Kosovo are
approaching a deadline set by the five-nation Contact Group.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Albania's support for the negotiations group of
Kosovo. Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs nine to one in the
separatist province of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
He accused the Serbs of trying to sabotage the peace talks,
adding that pro-Serb international players, a reference to Serbia'
s fellow-orthodox ally Russia, were to blame as well.

<P>
In Washington, President Bill Clinton and visiting French
President Jacques Chirac delivered a stern warning to Milosevic
that NATO was determined to launch air strikes against Serb
positions should Belgrade not agree to a Kosovo peace plan.
</P>
<P>
However, the Italian foreign ministry said Friday that If the
peace talks on Kosovo fail to yield an accord by the deadline on
Saturday, the Contact Group of six countries will discuss
responsibility before ordering NATO air strikes on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
As Washington and its European allies tried to push Serbs and
Kosovo ethnic Albanians to reach a deal in the French town of
Rambouillet, the Italian foreign ministry said in a statement that,
should they fail, any military action would take some time to
agree.
</P>
<P>
"If there should not be a positive outcome, Italy and the other
members of the Contact Group will discuss the responsibility for
the failure before meeting NATO partners to discuss the next moves,
" the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Contact group - the U.S., Russia, France, Britain, Italy
and Germany - are working to get the two delegations in
Rambouillet to accept a plan in which Kosovo has a high degree of
autonomy while remaining part of Serbia.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Chirac Differ on Banana Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton on
Friday indicated that there was no solution to the banana trade
dispute between the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
At a joint news conference with French President Jacques Chirac
at the White House, Clinton said Washington did not want to
provoke a trade crisis with the European Union over bananas, but
complained the EU has shown no willingness to resolve the dispute.
</P>
<P>
Clinton held talks with Chirac, who came here for two-day visit,
on a wide range of issues, including the banana trade dispute.
</P>
<P>
"We're being quite strong about it because we do have companies
involved and there are people involved in other countries, not
just the Caribbean -- Central America, for example-- and because
we think the trade law is clear," Clinton told the joint news
conference.
</P>
<P>
The United States is set to impose punitive import duties on
about 520 million dollars worth of imported products from the EU
beginning in early March for what Washington says is Europe's
failure to comply with a World Trade Organization ruling against a
EU banana import regime.
</P>
<P>
The EU says a new import regime complies with the WTO decision.
The United States says it does not comply, arguing that it
discriminates against bananas from Latin America in favor of those
grown in certain former European colonies, mainly in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
The United States does not produce bananas, but is fighting for
the rights of Chiquita Brands International Inc. and Dole Food Co.
to market bananas grown in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said he told Clinton during the meeting that while the
United States had companies, France had actual workers who were
affected by the dispute.
</P>
<P>
"I also added that bananas from the Caribbean were obviously
the best, best bananas in the world, therefore, they had to be
safeguarded," Chirac said.

<HEADLINE> FM: Poland to Formally Join NATO on March 12 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Polish Foreign Minister
Bronislaw Geremek announced Friday that he received the formal
invitation to the country's accession to NATO earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
The invitation extended by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright asked him to go to the United States on March 12 to
present the accession documents, Geremek told the press.
</P>
<P>
Albright declared that this will mark Warsaw's entry to the
western military alliance, said the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
The Polish parliament's upper and lower houses both approved
the accession documents on February 17 which were before President
Aleksander Kwasniewski for his signature. Kwasniewski is expected
to sign on the documents on February 26.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of the Czech Republic and Hungary are
expected to join Geremek at a ceremony which will mark the three

<HEADLINE> Ecological Challenges at China's Major Rivers (4) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Initial success in such restoration has been witnessed at
Donggou of Ping'an County, where once barren mountain slopes have
been covered with dense vegetation.
</P>
<P>
Xie Haiming, director of the county's forestry extension center,
says that since 1983, 160 hectares of larches and 1,450 hectares
of dragon spruce as well as many bushes have been grown on the
mountain slopes, and the forest coverage has since increased from
2.6 to 12.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
A stream, which used to dry up often in the mountains, has
resumed its constant flow, with its maximum water volume having
increased from 0.4 to 1 cubic meters per second. "We do not suffer
water shortage any more," Xie says.
</P>
<P>
While plants grow more slowly on the highland, Li Wen says, it
is also more costly to plant trees in Qinghai. "Normally we
mobilize people to dig pits of one-meter deep in the shape of
crescent moon in autumn, and plant saplings in them in spring.
Each pit is like a small reservoir which can store the maximum
possible amount of ground water."
</P>
<P>
As the mountain slopes are rocky, it is no easy job to dig such
pits. And because of harsh conditions on the highland, Li says, on
average 35 percent of saplings can survive after three years,
against 75 percent in east China and more than 90 percent in the
south. "We have to replant several times before a mountain slope
is covered with trees," he says.
</P>
<P>
State financial support for tree planting is 105-180 yuan (US$
12-22) per hectare, but actual costs range from 1,500 to 3,000
yuan (US$ 185-370), says Li Wen. "Tree planting here is basically
voluntary work, since the provincial government, with a revenue of
no more than 1.9 billion yuan (US$ 230 million) a year, can hardly
contribute much fund."
</P>
<P>
But the provincial leaders have a clear vision of the
relationship between development and ecological preservation. Says
Governor Bai Enpei, "Although Qinghai is a poor province, we
cannot seek immediate economic development at the cost of ecology
and environment; nor can we destroy conditions for later
generations to survive in order to solve the living problems of
this generation."
</P>
<P>
According to Wang Zhibao, director of the State Forestry
Administration, the central government has banned the felling of
trees in the upper reaches of the Yellow and Yangtze rivers
following serious flooding in central China and northeast China
last summer. In 30 years, he says, forest coverage at Qinghai's
river source areas is expected to go up to 27 percent.

<HEADLINE> Albanian Government Considers Mother Teresa Monument </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Albanian government is
considering plans for a monument to the Catholic missionary nun,
Mother Teresa, outside the National Museum in the capital, Tirana.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Territory Adjustment of the Albanian Republic (
CTAAR) on Friday discussed the project, submitted by the Studies
and Projects Institute, which includes plans for a public garden
in front of the National Museum, where a memorial to Mother Teresa,
who died in 1997, will be placed.
</P>
<P>
Another project, previously approved for the site by the Tirana
Council of Territory Adjustment, for the construction of a
business center, had been vetoed by Albanian Prime Minister
Pandeli Majko.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the council, which he leads, should discuss
the new project with the architects and the Tirana Council of
Territory Adjustment. After that it will be presented to the CTAAR
for final approval.
</P>
<P>
Mother Teresa was born Agnes Gouxha Bojaxhin in Yugoslavia of
Albanian parents in 1910. She went to live in India to help the
poor and the sick and later established the Society of the
Missionaries of Charity. She won the Nobel Prize for Peace in 1979.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex)
, the state-owned oil company, contributed 25.4 billion U.S.
dollars to the public treasury last year, 32.6 percent of fiscal
income, announced the Finance Ministry in a report on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that the oil income of Mexico dropped 3.8
percent as compared with that in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The oil price drop in 1998 forced finance authorities to make
three public spending cuts totalling 2.98 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The government had estimated a 15.50-dollar average oil price
per barrel, but the price of the Mexican mix was 10.16 dollars per
barrel at the end of last year, which meant a 38.3 percent
reduction.
</P>
<P>
Oil income represented 51 percent of the government income in
1983, however, that contribution dropped to 32.6 percent in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Indian PM to Hold Wide-Ranging Talks on Kashmir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAHORE (Pakistan), February 20 (Xinhua) -- The basic purpose of
the visit to Pakistan by Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee is to hold wide-ranging talks covering issues like
Kashmir and to "translate them into meaningful results."
</P>
<P>
This was stated here Friday evening by Indian High Commissioner
to Pakistan Gopalswamy Parthasarathy during a briefing to the
media covering the forthcoming visit by Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
He said Vajpayee's visit to Pakistan is third by an Indian
prime minister, the first was by Jawaharlal Nehru in 1958, the
second by Rajiv Gandhi in 1989 and the basis of the visit is that
there has been a will to enhance cooperation through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
There would be substantive talks at the delegation level and
one-to-one meetings between Vajpayee and his Pakistani counterpart
Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the past talks at the foreign secretary level, he
said that there were proposals given by Pakistan which were
acceptable to India and there were proposals given by India which
were given consent by Pakistan and the present talks would seek
positive results from these commonalities.
</P>
<P>
Answering various queries regarding taking up of touchy issues,
the Indian high commissioner said there would definitely be an
endeavor to reconcile the outstanding issues and the Simla
Agreement contains specified means to attain that.
</P>
<P>
About specific dialogue on the Kashmir issue, he said that the
leaders would discuss matters of mutual interest and Kashmir falls
in that scope.
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't go beyond this", he said, adding that there is
personal rapport between the two prime ministers and they are
meeting to reconcile the differences.
</P>
<P>
He said there has been interaction from both sides since the
meeting between the two leaders in New York in September last year
and both had expressed the desire to extend friendly relations.
</P>
<P>
Asked if India has been influenced by some third country to go
ahead with talks, he said, "we don't take outside advice and are
quite capable of managing our own affairs."
</P>
<P>
"Both the countries speak the same language and have the same
culture and we want to live as good neighbors," he added.

<HEADLINE> It's High Time to Sort Out Pak-India Disputes: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAHORE (Pakistan), February 20 (Xinhua) -- It is high time for
both India and Pakistan to sit together and evolve a strategy to
sort out their disputes to help defuse tension in the region,
Foreign Office Spokesman Tariq Altaf said Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan awaits emerging of positive results from the
scheduled high level contact between Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee and his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif, the
spokesman told the media.
</P>
<P>
"We entertain a positive thinking and expect India to
reciprocate likewise based on sentiments of goodwill and
understanding," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kashmir, he said, occupies a central position in the talks.
</P>
<P>
"Positive developments are important for the cause of stability
and peace in the region," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
"However, we should not expect a breakthrough out of the first
highest level contact. But, good response from India would be
highly appreciable in this context," said Altaf.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee is scheduled to arrive in Lahore Saturday afternoon
for a two-day visit on inaugural trans-border bus and is expected
to hold one-to-one meeting twice with Sharif during his weekend
stay in the city.
</P>
<P>
"The entire world including India has focused their eyes on
this important high profile meeting between the Pakistani and
Indian prime ministers to be held on February 20 in Lahore," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said, "the world now wants to see the equitable
and justifiable solution of all disputes being confronted by the
two countries."
</P>
<P>
He said that the world has realized that after the
nuclearization of the South Asian region, the tension and
instability in the region registered an increase.
</P>
<P>
He said both countries have their own point of view on the
Kashmir issue. However, "Pakistan's stand on Kashmir is always
crystal clear and justifiable across the world," he added.
</P>
<P>
Peace and security is essential for the future of both the
countries which could not be achieved without accepting Kashmir as
a critical and core issue, said Altaf.
</P>
<P>
The two-day summit is "a historic opportunity" and Pakistan is
looking forward to "a substantive and result-oriented dialogue,"
Altaf said.
</P>
<P>
"It is a historic opportunity," and Pakistan hoped all issues
including the central issue of Kashmir would be discussed during
the talks between the two prime ministers.
</P>
<P>
"We will be willing to resolve our problems on the basis of
justice and equity, in a spirit of finding solution to issues. We
have to take incremental approach to prove that we are there to
solve our issues," said Altaf.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Westmont Bank in the
Philippines is negotiating with three banks for possible merger
with one of them, according to a Malaya newspaper report Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Westmont Bank President John Espiritu has
identified the three banks as Security Bank and Trust Co., Allied
Banking Corp. and PDCP Bank.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu was quoted by the paper as saying that only after his
Westmont firms up discussions with any of the three banks will
foreign investors come in.
</P>
<P>
The three banks are doing the required due diligence that will
be completed within the first half of the year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu said that his bank is willing to be diluted of their
share-holdings and is ready to hand over the management control to
its investor.
</P>
<P>
Should Westmont merged with one of the three, it is ready to be
absorbed by the bigger bank, he said.

He added that the merger will be completed this year.

<HEADLINE> State and Individual Farms Cooperate in Egg Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Production of eggs by
individual families is thriving in Beijing's suburban areas, with
breeding chickens, chicken feed and technical know-how provided by
large, modern farms owned by the state.
</P>
<P>
State-owned egg farms and individual egg producers are no
longer rivals in market competition, but are partners of
cooperation sharing an increasingly lucrative egg market. The
results may well be summarized as "killing two birds with one
stone": increased incomes for farmers more importantly, and
reduced costs for those money-losing state-owned chicken farms.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has six large, modern state-owned egg farms, all
belonging to the Huadu Group which was set up by the Municipal
government in 1992 as part of the so-called "vegetable basket
project" to ensure supplies of non-staple foods for the
municipality.
</P>
<P>
Of every 100 eggs consumed in Beijing, somewhere between 15 and
20 are produced by Huadu. "We were losing Money. The problem lies
in the cost of production," says Zhang Dejiang, president of the
Huadu Group.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Huadu produced 20 million kg of eggs and had a deficit
of 20 million yuan (2.4 million U.S. dollars). "That means for
producing one kg of eggs, we lost one yuan," Zhang says.
</P>
<P>
Individually-owned farms, however, are small, family-based
businesses and hire a few seasonal laborers only when necessary.
The Huadu farms engage in industrialized production of eggs, hence
the need to use "standard" equipment and chicken feed. In
comparison, families can make do with whatever is at hand to build
chicken sheds with, and therefore there is practically no need to
count the depreciation of the fixed assets as a part of the
production cost. Besides, it is possible for individual farmers to
feed their chickens with things like chaff, plant leaves and
leftovers of meals which would otherwise be thrown away.
</P>
<P>
Though losing money, Huadu is reluctant to withdraw from the
local market. Through much weighing, Huadu decided to transfer its
chickens, all of fine, high-yielding breeds imported from the
United States, to individually-owned farms while providing them
with services including supply of technical know-how and standard
chicken feed.
</P>
<P>
Positive results were achieved almost instantly. The farm's
deficits began dwindling the second month after the new practice
was introduced.
</P>
<P>
By shifting a large part of its chicken raising business to
local farmers, the Yukou farm is able to concentrate on what is
relative profitable -- production of breeding chickens and eggs,
chicken feed, as well as processing of eliminated chickens for
meat, roast chickens and other products.
</P>
<P>
Yukou runs a network of 2,000 egg and chicken stores across
China, including Hong Kong. "the new practice will boost our
international business," Sun Hao says.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Foresees 11 Percent Inflation for 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian
government presented the International Monetary Fund (IMF) with an
11 per cent inflation forecast for 1999, the Folha de Sao Paulo
newspaper reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted high-ranking Brazilian officials in
negotiations with the IMF as saying that the figure is the most
pessimistic prediction ever made by the government since the real
devaluation.
</P>
<P>
The authorities in the talks committed themselves to control
annual inflation beginning from this month.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry had not yet defined the goal for the gross
domestic product (GDP) variation for this year.
</P>
<P>
Another important target to be defined in the agreement with
the IMF is the reduction of the public deficit.
</P>
<P>
The government had promised before the real devaluation to
reduce the deficit from 8.1 percent of the GDP registered in 1998
to 4.7 percent this year. Now, with higher inflation and lower GDP
growth, the target will be more modest.

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Former world number one Jim
Courier of the United States beat sixth-seeded Mariano Puerta of
Argentina to enter the semi-finals of the 700,000 U.S. dollars St.
Jude Indoor tennis tournament in Memphis, Tennessee, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Courier needed only 49 minutes to beat Puerta 6-0, 6-2 and set
up a clash against Dutch player John van Lottum of a 3-6, 7-6 (7-3)
, 6-4 winner over unseeded Daniel Nestor of Canada.
</P>
<P>
Puerta had played well enough to raise his ranking from 140
last February to 37th in the world currently. But he never found
his rhythm against Courier, who entered the tournament on a wild
card and is ranked 69th.
</P>
<P>
Puerta was broken in his first three service games and lost the
first set in 22 minutes. He double faulted five times and didn't
hold serve until he already trailed 2-0 in the second set.
</P>
<P>
Courier stayed focused between games and enjoyed the short
match after being taken to a tiebreaker in the second round and
three sets in the third.
</P>
<P>
Van Lottum reached his second career semi-final and first in a
year by holding off Nestor, who had reached the quarter-finals by
upsetting second seed Mark Philippoussis of Australia.

<HEADLINE> Chinese General Chi Haotian Starts Visit to Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 19 (Xinhua) -- China would like to make
concerted efforts with Pakistan to "bring the comprehensive
partnership of cooperation into the 21st century," senior Chinese
military official General Chi Haotian said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
General Chi, vice chairman of China's Central Military
Commission, arrived here Friday night at the start of his five-day
official and goodwill visit to Pakistan at the invitation of the
Pakistani government and its armed forces.
</P>
<P>
In his written speech upon his arrival, General Chi, who is
also state councilor and minister of national defense, said that
"Sino-Pak friendship has gone through the tests of time and
changes of situation. It is a fine example of friendly coexistence
between countries of different social systems."
</P>
<P>
He noted that Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit to Pakistan
in 1996 has laid a solid foundation for the establishment of the
Sino-Pak comprehensive partnership of cooperation oriented towards
the 21st century and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's visit
to China last year has further strengthened the bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to make concerted efforts with Pakistani friends
to bring our comprehensive partnership of cooperation into the
21st century," Chi said.
</P>
<P>
"The military relations between China and Pakistan is an
important component of the inter-state relations," said Chi.
</P>
<P>
Frequent exchanges of visits by leaders of defense institutions
and armed forces and further development of military relations of
friendly cooperation, not only meet the interests of the two
peoples, but also facilitate peace and stability of the region, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Chi said that his visit here is aimed at "enhancing mutual
understanding and trust, promoting friendship and cooperation and
strengthening the comprehensive partnership of cooperation towards
the 21st century between our two countries and two armed forces."
</P>
<P>
Chi and his entourage were met at the Islamabad International
Airport by Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz, Secretary of
the Defense Ministry Chaudhry Iftikhar and new Chinese Ambassador
to Pakistan Lu Shulin.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, General Chi will meet with President
Rafiq Tarar, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, Foreign Minister Sartaj
Aziz and three services chiefs of the Pakistani Army.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese general is scheduled to hold discussions on
defense, political, regional and international issues with the
Pakistani side. Special focus will be on security, peace and
economic development in the region.

<HEADLINE> Ecological Challenges at China's Major Rivers (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 20 (Xinhua) -- There is perhaps no other
place in China where the ecological situation is more vulnerable
than Qinghai in the country's far northwest.
</P>
<P>
It takes four years for a sapling of dragon spruce to grow
barely 5 cm tall, if it can survive hostile conditions such as a
70-day frost-free period a year, extreme aridity, strong wind and
severe cold in winter, not to mention the high altitude of well
over 2,000m above sea level of the plateau known as "the roof of
the world."
</P>
<P>
Barely one third of the province, which claims one eighth of
China's land area of 9.6 million square kilometers, is an altitude
fit for tree growth, according to Bai Enpei, governor of Qinghai.
Other parts of the province are covered with either deserts or
grassy land with very thin soil that is threatened by
desertification.
</P>
<P>
Governor Bai says he has never been so keenly conscious of
ecological issues until he assumed the current office in 1997,
although he had served as chief administrator of Yan'an Prefecture
on the Loess Plateau in Shaanxi and vice-chairman of the Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region, both known for their ecological
problems.
</P>
<P>
"In those areas my top concerns were work like planting trees,
water conservancy and environmental protection," he says. "But it
is in Qinghai, the source of some of China's major rivers
including the two longest, the Yangtze and the Yellow River, that
I have been faced with real challenges."
</P>
<P>
In Yan'an and Inner Mongolia, ecological problems are
manifested in soil erosion or desertification. But in Qinghai, he
says, "You are hit by both."

<HEADLINE> Ecological Challenges at China's Major Rivers (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The challenge is enormous for anyone who wishes to cover the
barren mountains with trees in Qinghai. "In Yan'an, it takes three
years for a tree to a size which in south China's Guangdong
requires only one year to reach," Bai says. "But in Qinghai, it
takes ten years."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, trees are scarce in Qinghai, where forest coverage
stands at only 2.59 percent, the lowest in China, according to
Wang Qian, director of the provincial forest administration.
</P>
<P>
"With a population of five million," Wang says, "we only plant
33,000 hectares of trees every year. At such a pace, it will take
us 20 years to increase our forest coverage by 0.1 percent."
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Governor Bai says it is vital for Qinghai to
preserve its ecology. "Our geographical location at the source of
China's greatest rivers requires that we should not allow our
ecology to deteriorate further, lest the whole systems of the
Yangtze and Yellow rivers be adversely affected."
</P>
<P>
Qinghai's downstream regions have already suffered the impact
of ecological deterioration, he says.
</P>
<P>
"Our province claims 48 percent of the total volume of the
Yellow River water," he says.
</P>
<P>
"In 1997, the river's water flow decreased by 23 percent within
Qinghai."
</P>
<P>
That year marked the worst drying-up of the Yellow River, with
only 180 million cubic meters of water reaching the sea, against
20 billion cubic meters in a normal year.
</P>
<P>
"While the abnormal climate such as El Nino played a role in
the river's drying-up, we feel that denudation in the source areas
of the Yellow River also had much to do with it," says the
governor.
</P>
<P>
"Too many trees have been cut down over the past few decades."
</P>
<P>
As Bai and his colleagues are working out measures to preserve
the ecology in Qinghai, people in some areas of the province are
enjoying the benefits of their ecological undertakings.

<HEADLINE> Indian PM Vajpayee Arrives in Pakistan Saturday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee is scheduled to arrive in Lahore, capital of
Punjab province, Saturday afternoon on a crucial two-day visit to
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee, 72, the first Indian prime minister to visit Pakistan
in a decade, is due to cross Wagah, a border checkpoint located
around 22 kilometers east of Lahore at 16:00 p.m. local time
(11:00 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Making the inaugural journey of the New Delhi-Lahore bus
service, the first ever trans-border bus service between the two
countries, Vajpayee is visiting Pakistan at the invitation of his
Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif in a bid to improve relations
between the two South Asian neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Sharif will greet Vajpayee soon after he sets foot on the
Pakistani soil after passing through an iron gate guarded by
ceremonial troops from both sides.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee, who visited Pakistan in 1979 in the capacity of
Indian foreign minister, will be extended all the formal
courtesies as head of government.
</P>
<P>
The welcome ceremony will last about 40 minutes and include an
honor guard and a 19 gun salvo, officials said.
</P>
<P>
During his weekend stay in Lahore, the second largest city of
Pakistan, Vajpayee will have one-to-one meeting with Sharif twice
on issues including the Jammu and Kashmir dispute.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee, who is completing one year in power next month, will
hold an informal meeting with Sharif without aids soon after his
arrival at Governor House, and will attend a state banquet being
hosted for him by Sharif at 20:00 p.m., the officials said.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the two prime ministers are scheduled to hold a
formal one-to-one talk followed by a civic reception. A joint
press conference is also scheduled to be held Sunday before
Vajpayee's departure for New Delhi in the evening.
</P>
<P>
In the forthcoming talks between Vajpayee and Sharif, the
settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir issue, the root cause of
tension and instability in the region, is expected to be accorded
the highest priority.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers agreed in their joint statement in New
York last September that an environment of durable peace and
stability was in the supreme national interests of both countries
as well as the region.

Villagers of Xiaogaoling in Huangyuan County, for one, have
managed to build a green shelter on the mountains surrounding
their village in the past 40 years at an average altitude of 2,800
m above sea level. The 400,000 trees covering 513 hectares of
terraced fields have increased the village's forest coverage from
zero to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
And the benefits from the green are obvious. Says Li Jifu, the
63-year-old head of the village of 450 households: "Years ago when
soil erosion was severe, grain yield was only 150 catties per mu (
1,125 kilos per hectare). Now we easily gather in 700-800 catties
of grain per mu (5,250-6,000 kilos per hectare)."
</P>
<P>
In addition, he says, the village earns 50,000 to 70,000 yuan (
US$ 6,000-8,700) a year from planned logging of their forest. "And
the trees have enabled us to better withstand natural disasters."
</P>
<P>
According to Li Wen, an official with the Forestry Bureau of
Qinghai, a 58 mm downpour within two hours in August 1997 caused a
mud-rock-flow at the Longyang Gorge Hydropower Station, the first
such project after the Yellow River flows out of its sources in
Bayan Har Shan range.
</P>
<P>
The torrents rushed into the engine house and damaged all the
four generating units, forcing an halt to the station's operation
for 30 days and costing a direct loss of 11 million yuan (US$ 14
million).
</P>
<P>
The same storm simultaneously hit Xiaogaoling 70 km away, but
nothing wrong happened, "thanks to our trees," says Li Jifu. By
contrast, mountains around the Longyang reservoir have no
vegetation.
</P>
<P>
"We keep planting trees all these years and our forest coverage
grows by 20 hectares every year," says the village head. "Our
timber reserve has been growing faster than what we log." He is
the sixth village head to lead the villagers in planting trees in
the past 40 years.
</P>
<P>
Li Wen says many mountains in Qinghai used to be covered with
dense woods, and they were denuded over the past 60 years, due to
wars and miscalculated construction plans.
</P>
<P>
"It is much harder to recover the ecology but much easier to
destroy it," he says. "But we must restore what has been destroyed.
"

<HEADLINE> Chelsea Assistant Coach Admits Sex Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Chelsea soccer club assistant
coach Graham Rix faced up to 10 years' jail after admitting sex
with a girl of 15.
</P>
<P>
The father of four and former England international, 41, Friday
admitted one charge of unlawful intercourse and another of
indecent assault at London's Knightsbridge Crown Court.
</P>
<P>
Judge Timothy Pontius renewed Rix's bail on condition that he
did not contact the girl or her family "either directly or
indirectly".
</P>
<P>
He also told Rix it would be "very much in your interests to co-
operate and tell ... everything" to the probation officer who
would interview him.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that I'm about to release you on bail and the fact
that I have ordered a report should not for a moment be taken by
you as an indication of the sentence you will ultimately receive,"
the judge said.
</P>
<P>
"Because of the gravity of these offences, I must keep all my
sentencing options open and they include, perhaps in the forefront,
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
"I want you to be realistic about your position," he added.
</P>
<P>
Rix, from Richmond, south-west London, who was capped for
England 17 times, is regarded as one of the country's top coaches
and is in charge of Chelsea's expensive line-up of foreign stars.
</P>
<P>
He is assistant manager to former Italian international
Gianluca Vialli.
</P>
<P>
Rix, who has been married for 17 years, is said to have met the
girl at a west London hotel.
</P>
<P>
The smartly dressed coach breathed deeply before replying "
guilty" to the first of the four charges, that he indecently
assaulted the 15-year-old on 8 January 1998.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution accepted his pleas of not guilty to the next
two charges, which alleged similar offences in the weeks leading
up to 27 February, the night before Chelsea's home defeat to
Manchester United.
</P>
<P>
But Rix then pleaded guilty to a fourth count, which alleged
that that evening he had had unlawful sexual intercourse with the
girl, who is now 16.
</P>
<P>
Sentencing was adjourned until 26 March for reports to be drawn
up.
</P>
<P>
The maximum sentence for having unlawful sex with a girl under
16 years of age is two years, but for indecent assault it is 10
years.

<HEADLINE> Italy: Kosovo Air Strikes Will Come Only After Discussion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 19 (Xinhua) -- If the peace talks on Kosovo fail
to yield an accord by the deadline at noon Saturday, the Contact
Group of six countries will discuss responsibility before ordering
NATO air-strikes on Yugoslavia, the Italian foreign ministry said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
As Washington and its European allies tried to push Serbs and
Kosovo ethnic Albanians to reach a deal in the French town of
Rambouillet, the Italian foreign ministry said in a statement that,
should they fail, any military action would take some time to
agree.
</P>
<P>
"If there should not be a positive outcome, Italy and the other
members of the Contact Group will discuss the responsibility for
the failure before meeting NATO partners to discuss the next moves,
" the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement urged both sides in the Kosovo dispute to act
responsibly and agree terms by Saturday's deadline to the two-week
long talks.
</P>
<P>
The threat of military action in Kosovo by western powers
appeared ever more probable as Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic in Belgrade swore his country would never give up Kosovo,
even under bombardment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Washington, the U.S. government threatened
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, who has ultimate power over
the Serb delegation at Rambouillet, with "grave consequences" if
he were to oppose a peace accord for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
According to the Italian news agency ANSA, the U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
and his French counterpart, Hubert Vedrine, are expected to fly to
Belgrade Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Italy and its Contact Group partners - the U.S., Russia, France,
Britain and Germany - are working to get the two delegations in
Rambouillet to accept a plan in which Kosovo has a high degree of
autonomy while remaining part of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
The Italian foreign ministry said that the proposal is a "
balanced" solution, going part of the way to meeting the demands
of both sides.
</P>
<P>
It would be in everyone's interests for the accord to be
monitored on the ground by an international peacekeeping force,
which would protect the rights of the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo,
the statement said.

Asian countries, said Manuel Torrijos, presidential candidate of
the Revolution Democratic Party (PRD), on Friday.
</P>

neutrality that commits us to develop a foreign policy without
distinctions with all the countries, considering that the Asian
countries are the most frequent users of the Panama Canal," he
said.
</P>
<P>
China ranks third as user of the interoceanic canal, after the
United States and Japan, shipping goods and products to Latin
American countries.
</P>
<P>
Torrijos said that if elected, he will guarantee free transit
through the waterway to all users.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- England caretaker manager Kevin
Keegan hoped Terry Venables to replace him as the permanent
national team boss.
</P>
<P>
Venables, seen by many as the people's choice, has admitted he
was disappointed not to be asked back to the job he gave up in
1996.
</P>
<P>
But Keegan's backing comes amid newspaper speculation that the
FA is planning to tempt the Euro '96 coach back when Keegan's
involvement ends in June.
</P>
<P>
When answering the question on BBC Radio 5 Live who he thought
should succeed him, Kegan replied: "I think definitely Terry
Venables. That will please a lot of people."
</P>
<P>
However Keegan also hinted that he could carry on as England's
boss after his four games in charge.
</P>
<P>
When asked if there was even the remotest possibility of him
taking the job on, he said: "What we've got to look at is if it
works part-time.
</P>
<P>
"If it works part-time maybe we could sit down and look at it
again then because there are only two qualifying games left, but
at this moment in time the FA is looking for a successor and I
think that's right."

The device was not lit.
</P>
<P>
Kohler took control of the club eight years ago but since then
Luton have twice been relegated. Some fans have blamed him because
of the club's policy of selling players to balance the books.
</P>
<P>
They also complained that he was drawing a salary from the club
which it could ill-afford to pay, having appointed himself
managing director. He owns 52% of the club's shares.
</P>
<P>
Kohler said: "I've been involved with Luton Town for a quarter
of my life and have always tried my best to act in the interests
of the club.
</P>
<P>
"What happened this morning is an act that any reasonable
person must deplore. As a husband and father of three children,
the youngest only five weeks old, my primary responsibility is to
them.
</P>
<P>
"The police have viewed this petrol bomb as a warning. However,
I am not prepared to use my family as a shield or place them in
any circumstances that could endanger them."
</P>
<P>
He said he would not be attending Luton's match at Bristol
Rovers on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Communications Industry Reports High Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's communications
industry has maintained a 50 percent growth rate for seven years
running, with the annual output value reaching 22 billion yuan
last year.
</P>
<P>
Many of the city's communications products, such as digital
program-controlled switchboards and optical transmission equipment,
have gained at least a 30 percent share of the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts attribute the high growth mainly to the
introduction of advanced technology from abroad and the city's
efforts for innovation.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade or so, an increasing number of communication
multinationals, including Bell, Alcatel and Motorola, have begun
operations in the city, with combined overseas capital adding up
to one-billion U.S. dollars. They have introduced high technology
and management expertise, and have helped narrow the gap of the
local communications industry with the advanced international
level.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai also has established a series of technology
development centers, including several at the state-level, with
emphasis on developing high-tech communications products.
</P>
<P>
The city is now concentrating on the development and
manufacture of ten new products including mobile
telecommunications equipment and communications software, and the
annual output of this industry is expected to reach 35 billion
yuan next year.

<HEADLINE> Devers Clocks Season's Best Indoor Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 19 (Xinhua) -- American world indoor
champion Gail Devers won the women's 60 meters title with the
fastest time of the season of 7.01 seconds at the Flanders indoor
meeting in Ghent, Belgium, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Russia's world indoor record holder Irina Privalova, who set
her world mark of 6.92 in Madrid four years ago, finished last in
7.23 after having just scraped into the final.
</P>
<P>
Devers, twice Olympic 100 meters champion, had already equalled
her previous season's best of 7.04, set in Birmingham, England,
last Sunday, in her heat.
</P>
<P>
Devers will run next in Lievin, France, on Sunday and in
Stockholm on Thursday before competing in the U.S. indoor
championships on February 27.
</P>
<P>
Triple world champion Ivan Pedroso of Cuba also set a season's
best by leaping 8.26 meters in the long jump, bettering Romanian
Bogdan Tudor's mark by one centimeter.
</P>
<P>
World indoor champion Sunday Bada of Nigeria faded badly in the
final stretch of the 400 meters and was beaten by Briton Duane
Ladejo.
</P>
<P>
Another world champion, Cuban Anier Garcia, was also beaten
into second place in the 60 meters hurdles. American Courtney
Hawkins pipped Garcia by one-hundredth of a second, clocking 7.55.
</P>
<P>
Former world indoor champion Bruny Surin of Canada was never in
contention and finished fourth in 7.69.

<P>
BRUSSELS, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Australian Open champion
Yevgeny Kafelnikov advanced to the semi-finals of the world indoor
tennis tournament by beating Swiss teenager Roger Federer in
Rotterdam, the Netherlands, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Federer, 17, gained an early break in the deciding set against
the Russian second seed but his nerve failed and Kafelnikov broke
his service twice for a 6-1, 5-7, 6-4 win.
</P>
<P>
Kafelnikov will now face fifth-seeded Briton Greg Rusedski, who
won a hard-fought two-hour battle against Cedric Pioline of France
before winning 7-6, 3-6, 7-6.
</P>
<P>
Pioline, who crushed Dutch hopes of a home win by knocking out
Paul Haarhuis in the first round and fourth-seeded Richard
Krajicek in the second, recovered in the second set only to be
floored by Rusedski's powerful serves.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Tim Henman, the third seed, survived a mini-crisis in
the second set to book his place in the last four with a 6-4, 7-6
win over Slovakia's Karol Kucera.

<HEADLINE> Pak PM Announces Abolition of Military Courts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif Friday announced abolition of military courts in
accordance with a verdict of the Supreme Court and vowed not to
allow terrorists to re-establish their foothold.
</P>
<P>
"We have ordered abolition of the military courts," said Sharif
in his nation-wide address on television and radio Friday night.
</P>
<P>
"The constitution tells us to respect the courts, their
decisions, the upholding of the constitution is our obligation and
we will do it," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that "the justice will triumph at all costs," adding
his only mission was to establish peace and provide justice to the
oppressed and hapless people across the country.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would continue to uphold the
constitution but in doing so would not allow any quarter to
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
However, he also said that people wanted only prompt and
inexpensive justice and were least bothered whether they got it
from civil, military or special courts.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister appreciated the role played by the armed
forces and police in the southern port city of Karachi in
supporting the government's drive against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
A nine-member bench headed by Chief Justice of the Supreme
Court Ajmal Mian on Wednesday held the establishment of military
courts as unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
The Sharif government first set up military courts in Karachi
on November 20 last year after dismissing the Sindh provincial
government and imposing direct federal rule to arrest ethnic,
political and factional violence in the provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
Sharif, who himself escaped an attempt on his life early
January, made an announcement to set up military courts throughout
the country in Lahore, provincial capital of Punjab, on January
30.

<HEADLINE> Magic Johnson Blames Rodman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 19 (Xinhua ) -- Magic Johnson said the Los
Angeles Lakers should forget about signing Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
Johnson said the uncertainly surrounding Rodman's situation has
damaged the image of the team he led to five NBA championships
during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Rodman, who appeared on ESPN's "Up Close," last night, said he
still hasn't made a definite decision as to whether he's going to
play this season or not.
</P>
<P>
"If I play basketball, it will be between two teams, the Lakers
or Miami, and the odds are that's going to happen within the next
48 hours," Rodman said.
</P>
<P>
Rodman said he would announce a decision by Monday at the
latest, but that might not mean much.
</P>
<P>
"I'm tired of this. I am," Johnson, a part-owner and vice
president of the Lakers, said Thursday night. "I'm going to say
this tonight and I've been holding it. It's like a circus now.
</P>
<P>
"We are a frist-class organization. We do things the right way,
and right now, he's like trying to hold us hostage. He's driving
me crazy because he's hurting the team, he's hurting the
organization, so I would love us just to say forget it."
</P>
<P>
The Lakers can sign Rodman only for the veteran minimum of one
million U.S. dollars, prorated to 600,000 for the shortened season
and diminishing further with each game he misses. However, Rodman
will receive three million U.S. dollars in a deal with Converse if
he plays in Los Angeles, Chicago or New York.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets Ends The Week Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON February 19 (Xinhua) - European stock markets ended an
uneasy trading week on a mixed note Friday ahead of a gathering at
the weekend of G7 finance ministers.
</P>
<P>
The meeting comes amid calls all over the world for a new
"financial architecture" that would help avert crises in emerging
markets such as Brazil, Russia and Asia.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE fell 43.7 points - its third straight decline -
to 6031.2 as Britain's number-two mortgage lender, Abbey National,
tumbled nearly 7 percent on the heels of a disappointing earnings
report.
</P>
<P>
At its opening, the London market ignored Wall Street's robust
performance on Thursday, and was instead dragged down by
disappointment with results from Abbey National.
</P>
<P>
"People are wary that the US is being driven by tech stocks.
One day they can be up 2 percent and the next day they can be
off," said a dealer in the City.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, the Xetra Dax was down 47.83 to finish on
4823.26. German share prices fell back from earlier gains after
the release of weak economic data in France and Germany raised
fears about slower euro-zone growth.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the Cac-40 was up 72.21 to reach 4111.62. French
stocks rallied late in the session as Wall Street held steady on
its opening and on a firmer dollar.

<P>
BERLIN, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) urged
Friday the parties to the conflict in Kosovo to use the remaining
hours of the Rambouillet conference to reach an interim agreement
for the troubled southern Serb province.
</P>
<P>
In a declaration issued by its German presidency, the EU said
that failure of the talks could lead to a humanitarian disaster
and endanger the stability of the entire region.
</P>
<P>
If this happened there would be consequences for those
responsible for the Kosovo conflict, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The peace offer now on the table took into account the
legitimate interests of both parties to the conflict, it said.
</P>
<P>
The package could smooth the way for a new chapter between all
ethnic groups in Kosovo and Yugoslavia, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The deadline for agreement at the talks runs out at midday
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer will travel to
Rambouillet Saturday morning to meet with the parties to the
conflict and urge them to reach agreement on an interim accord,

Also on Friday, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard told a press
conference that "The Security Council is expected to hold a formal
meeting on the U.N. Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA) on February
26," the date of the expiration of its mandate.
</P>
<P>
Van Dunem "Mbinda", Angolan permanent representative to the
United Nations, told reporters on Thursday afternoon that he had
briefed the U.N. Security Council on the latest development in
Angola.
</P>
<P>
What was briefed included the military and security situation,
the humanitarian situation and the human rights, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Some decision has to be made very quickly before the end of
this month to know what will be the future presence of the U.N. in
Angola," he said, "This is still being discussed."
</P>
<P>
The Angolan Government has repeatedly said that it wants the
1,000-member MONUA to leave the country because it failed to
disarm rebel UNITA, namely the National Union for Total
Independence of Angola.
</P>
<P>
The peace agreement, signed in 1994, collapsed in early
December last year when the government forces failed in its
attempts to seize the UNITA-held territory.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan recommended pulling out the
U.N. mission after the two U.N.-chartered planes crashed
respectively on December 26 last year and January 2 this year as
fighting intensified between rebels and government troops in
central Angola.
</P>
<P>
The Security accused the rebels of being primarily responsible
for sabotaging the 1994 peace accord that ended 20 years of civil
war. UNITA has refused to disarm itself and hand over the
territory under its control to the national unity government as
called for in the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council insisted on limited U.N. political and
military presence in the country to promote the peace process and
render humanitarian assistance, even under another name.

WASHINGTON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Friday that he learned a lot of "personal lessons" from his
impeachment battle and expected to have "two good years" left in
office.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint news conference with visiting French
President Jacques Chirac, Clinton said, "I've learned a lot of
personal lessons, most of which I've already discussed."
</P>
<P>
"My advice to future presidents would be to decide what you
ought to do for the benefit of the country, and work on it hard."
</P>
<P>
"I hope the presidency hasn't been harmed. I don't believe it
has been," Clinton said. "I don't think I could say this has been
good for the country," he added.
</P>
<P>
"I expect to have two good years here," he said. His term
expires in January 2001.
</P>
<P>
"I think the American people expect me and the Congress to get
back to work," he said.
</P>
<P>
On February 12, the U.S. Senate ended the impeachment trial
against Clinton and declared acquittal of his perjury and
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, was
charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in two articles of
impeachment in connection with his relationship with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky. The two articles were approved by
the House along partisan lines on December 19 last year.

<HEADLINE> Moldova: Economist Nominated New Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, February 19 (Xinhua) - Moldovan President Petru
Lucinschi on Friday nominated Deputy Prime Minister Ion Sturza for
the post of prime minister after the previous nominee withdrew his
candidacy on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sturza, a 38-year-old economist, was in charge of economic
reforms in the previous government and often held negotiations
with the International Monetary Fund, Moldova's main lender.
According to the constitution, he is empowered to form a new team
within 15 days and then present it for parliamentary approval.
</P>
<P>
Sturza is able to lead the country out of the current crisis,
President Lucinschi Friday stressed in the parliament, adding that
"he knows the country's real economic situation and has good
relations with international financial organisations."
</P>
<P>
The new nominee told deputies that the cabinet should enjoy
political support of the legislature and said he would hold close
consultations with all parliamentary factions on the composition
of the new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The Capital Mayor Serafim Urecheanu, Lucinschi's previous
nominee, had demanded the parliament to give up the traditional
coalition principle of forming the government and grant the
cabinet more powers to fight the current economic crisis. He
withdrew his candidacy after failing to win parliamentary support
for his demands.
</P>
<P>
Urecheanu was nominated two weeks ago to replace former Prime
Minister Ion Ciubuc who handed in his resignation on 1 February,
saying he was unable to consolidate his cabinet because of its
diverse composition.

WASHINGTON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said on Friday that the United States and its allies in Europe
"stand united in our determination to use force" if Serbs fail
to accept the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
At a joint news conference with French President Jacques
Chirac, Clinton said: "it would be a mistake to extend a Saturday
deadline" for an peace agreement to be reached.
</P>
<P>
"I have ordered our aircraft to be ready to act as part of the
NATO operation," Clinton told the joint news conference which was
held less than 14 hours before the 6 a.m. EST deadline that NATO
imposed for talks to reach the peace agreement.
</P>

Clinton spoke against a bleak background, shortly after
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic refused to meet a U.S.
envoy who was making a last-ditch attempt in Belgrade to work
out a peace plan for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Christopher Hill, the American diplomat mediating the peace
talks in Rambouillet, France, returned empty-handed to the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that, if no accord is reached, NATO was ready to
pursue "a strategy that would at least reduce his capacity to
take further aggressive military action against the Kosovar
Albanians."
</P>
<P>
The French president said that France and the United States
were "in complete agreement" on Kosovo. Chirac called on
Milosevic to "choose the path of wisdom and not the path of war."
He said Milosevic "holds the key" to what happens next.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Exports at Record Levels in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Canadian International Trade
Minister Sergio Marchi announced that record setting year-end
trade statistics released by Statistics Canada Friday indicate
that trade is strengthening Canadian prosperity.
</P>
<P>
"All-time high trade figures during a period when many world
economies have taken tough hits should tell us that we are on the
right track, with the right trade policies, at the right time,"
said Minister Marchi.
</P>
<P>
Statistics Canada released figures showed that Canada's
merchandise export performance in 1998 increased 7.4 percent over
1997 to 323.4 billion Canadian dollars (216.7 billion U.S.
dollars), and almost doubled from 163 billion Canadian dollars
(109.2 billion U.S. dollars) in 1992.
</P>
<P>
A 9.8 percent increase in merchandise imports in 1998 resulted
in an overall Canadian trade surplus of 19.4 billion Canadian
dollars (13 billion U.S. dollars) that year.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. remains by far our most important trading partner.
It's great to see that we are selling more high-skilled and
knowledge-intensive products in one of the most competitive
markets in the world," Minister Marchi said.
</P>
<P>
Canada's strong export performance in 1998 is all the more
remarkable given the tough economic times in Asia and Latin
America. Canada's merchandise trade statistics indicate that
overall Canadian exports declined by 27.7 percent to most of
Canada's Asian trading partners, and by 10.2 percent to Latin
America. However, exports to Asia only account for 5.7 percent of
Canada's overall exports, while exports to Latin Americ account
for 1.8 percent.

<P>
Finance ministers were due to meet in Bonn after public
rejection by the United States of calls by German Finance Minister
Oskar Lafontaine, backed by Japan, for setting up some kind of
currency target zones.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin has rejected setting
target currency levels or managing exchange rates. Other finance

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Russia's lower house of
parliament on Friday unleashed a fierce attack on NATO's new
strategic doctrine.
</P>
<P>
In a statement addressed to parliaments of the member states of
the United Nations, the Russian State Duma lambasted NATO attempts
to bypass the United Nations in world affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Duma said the new doctrine, representing a major revision
to the transatlantic alliance's strategy, will have a bearing on
the security interests of all the countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that the new NATO doctrine is in essence intended
to annul the United Nations' leading role in safeguarding world
peace and that such a doctrine might threaten the role of the
world body and all existing systems of international relations.
</P>
<P>
The statement warned that NATO's new strategy might lead to the
weakening of the effectiveness of such regional organizations as
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
It said that the authority to sanction the use of force should
not rest with certain clique of states and that the United Nations
should continue to be the unique body that can ensure world
stability.

BERLIN, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli security guards who
shot dead three Kurdish protesters during the storming of Israel's
consulate in Berlin cannot be accused of any wrongdoing, the
German Foreign Ministry said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The two guards, who wounded a number of other protesters, were
not culpable and enjoyed diplomatic immunity, said the foreign
ministry in a preliminary decision on the case.
</P>
<P>
Israeli guards reportedly opened fire on the Kurds after they
had forced their way into the Berlin consulate Wednesday and
attempted to take a woman member of staff hostage.
</P>
<P>
The incident came on a day of attacks against diplomatic
missions by Kurds protesting the seizure of Kurdish Workers Party
(PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan by Turkey.

WASHINGTON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Friday that he learned a lot of "personal lessons" from his
impeachment battle and expected to have "two good years" left in
office.
</P>
<P>
At his first news conference since his acquittal by the Senate,
Clinton said the American people don't want him and Congress to
have any "disruptive feelings" left between them.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes the Constitution has been "re-ratified" by
the impeachment process. And he said he doesn't believe the
presidency has been harmed.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also said his advice to future presidents would be to
decide what they ought to do for the country, focus on it, and
work hard.
</P>
<P>
On February 12, the U.S. Senate ended the impeachment trial
against Clinton and declared acquittal of his perjury and
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, was
charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in two articles of
impeachment in connection with his relationship with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky. The two articles were approved by
the House along partisan lines on December 19 last year.

<HEADLINE> World Bank to Aid Ghana's Public Sector Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank will spend some
58 million U.S. Dollars in technical assistance and training for
the Public Sector Reform Program in Ghana, the state-run Ghana
News Agency said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The program, spanning 11 years, aims at giving a new face to
public institutions, especially making subvented organizations
viable in the west African country.
</P>
<P>
A World Bank team which undertook preliminary assessment of the
entire public sector with the view of appraising its performance
called on Ghanaian Vice-President John Atta Mills in Accra Friday.
</P>
<P>
The team, led by David Steedman, discussed its findings with
the vice- president who also chairs the National Oversight
Committee of the program.
</P>
<P>
Steedman who described the appraisal as very successful
indicated that the team would proceed with negotiations for final
documentation of the program to take account of the few changes
needed to be made.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the project which is billed to take off in
August will emphasize reforms in subvented organizations on pilot
basis to assess the suitability of the methodology, said the World
Bank official.
</P>
<P>
He said that in all, some 24 subvented organizations would be
involved, some of which will be privatized while others would be
given a "new face" to become commercially viable.
</P>
<P>
Mills expressed appreciation of the World Bank's support in
the public sector reform program which he described as crucial to
Ghana's national economy.
</P>
<P>
"We take the program seriously because no amount of economic
reform will yield meaningful results without support," said the
vice-president.
</P>
<P>
He said that an enhanced and efficient public sector will play
a leading role in providing incentives to the private sector to
become the hub of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Mills also expressed optimism that the reform program would
realize its targets.
