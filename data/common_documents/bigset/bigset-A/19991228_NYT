   YUGOSLAVIA-SOLDIER (Leskovac, Yugoslavia) _ For Vlada, a unit
commander for the Yugoslav army during the Kosovo war, the months

repression, stemming from his participation in anti-government
demonstrations in this conservative, wary town. He thinks he's
slightly mad; he thinks everyone else in Leskovac is, too. By

   CHINA-QIGONG (Beijing) _ A thriving anti-cancer movement based
on breathing exercises and strenuous walking is one of hundreds of
qigong variants operating in China, even as the authorities crack
down on one prominent offshoot, Falun Gong, and step up scrutiny of
the others. The official acceptance of some qigong sects while
others are crushed is part of a long, often tortuous effort by the
government to distinguish supposedly scientific, beneficial qigong
from practices labeled superstitious and then curbed. By Erik

   GORE-CAMPAIGN (Washington) _ It is hard now to think of a
candidate who has undergone more transformations in a shorter
period than Al Gore. Now Gore faces the most critical weeks of his
political career, a hectic two-and-a-half-month campaign sprint
through Iowa, New Hampshire, New York, California and the Deep
South that will most likely determine whether his frantic

everyone is sure that the computers and the machinery in which they
are often embedded will perform flawlessly as they roll past

   RUSSIA-OIL (Moscow) _ On its face, it is no great shakes that
Russia's sixth-biggest oil company, Sibneft, unveiled a spiffy new
green-and-blue logo in April. What makes it a symbolic symbol
indeed is the logo's two flavors: traditional Cyrillic, for
Russians, and English, for almost everyone else. For an industry

3 HURT IN CLUB SHOOTINGS; PUFFY COMBS FACES GUN POSSESSION
CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for inserts, rewriting throughout) (sw) 
 By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sean (Puffy) Combs, the multimillionaire rap
entrepreneur whose career and lavish East Hampton parties have been
fodder for the gossip columns, was arrested on gun possession
charges with the actress and singer Jennifer Lopez after shots were
fired at a Times Square dance club early Monday, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Three people were wounded in gunfire at 2:55 a.m. at Club New
York, which sent panic-stricken clubgoers into the frigid air
outside the nightspot on West 43rd Street, the police and witnesses
said. The police described the victims as bystanders, and said that
none of them suffered life-threatening injuries. Neither Ms. Lopez
nor Combs was charged in connection with the shootings, and Ms.
Lopez was later cleared of any involvement and released.
</P>
<P>
   A rap performer who was in Combs' group, Jamal Barrows, 19, was
charged with three counts of attempted murder and criminal
possession of a weapon, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators later said they were looking into witness accounts
that Barrows fired because he believed that someone had said
something disrespectful to Combs. Prosecutors also said that Combs
drew a gun during the incident, but Combs denied that he was
involved.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said a witness told the police that both Combs and
Barrows were arguing with several other people in the club and that
after one of them threw a stack of money at Combs, Barrows fired a
9 mm pistol. Prosecutors said at Combs's arraignment on Monday
night that he drew a gun, but did not fire it.
</P>
<P>
   Looking exhausted and disheveled at Manhattan Criminal Court
late on Monday night after his release on $10,000 bail, Combs
denied he had ever had or drawn a pistol. ``I do not own a gun, I
do not carry a gun,'' he said. ``The charges against me are 100
percent false and I feel confident that in the next couple of days
I'll be vindicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir said on Monday that Combs and
Ms. Lopez, who both fled after the shooting in a 1999 Lincoln
Navigator, had been arrested along with Combs' bodyguard and his
driver on gun possession charges, because a stolen pistol was found
in the vehicle. The gun found in the vehicle was not the same one
used in the shootings in the club, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan District Attorney's office decided to release Ms.
Lopez. Officials said Ms. Lopez, who has appeared in nearly a dozen
films and has been romantically linked to Combs, was released
because she was unaware that the gun was in the car and because she
cooperated with the police.
</P>
<P>
   Combs, 30, who grew up in Harlem, rose from an intern at a small
rap record label to become one of the hip-hop world's leading
impresarios. His successful recording career led to his greater
success as a producer and promoter; he founded his own label, Bad
Boy Records, which he later sold to Arista Records for $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lopez, 29, was released about 4 p.m. from the Midtown South
Precinct station house. Her lawyer, Larry Ruggiero, said: ``They
established she did nothing wrong. Jennifer had nothing to do with
the gun or the shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   Also arrested on Monday were Combs' bodyguard, Anthony Jones,
34, and Combs' driver, Wardel Fenderson, 41. The police charged
Combs, Jones and Fenderson with criminal possession of a weapon and
criminal possession of stolen property, because the 9 mm Smith &AMP;
Wesson Model 915 pistol found in the Navigator was reported stolen
in August in Georgia, the authorities said. Jones was also charged
with marijuana possession, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the club investigators recovered four shell casings, two
from a 9 mm pistol and two from a .40-caliber gun, the police said.
The 9 mm casings were believed to have come from the weapon that
the police said Barrows was carrying when he was arrested. It was
not clear who fired the .40-caliber bullets, and no .40-caliber
pistol has been recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Eric S. Funk, the club's general manager, said Combs and Ms.
Lopez arrived with an entourage of about 30 people sometime after
midnight and spent most of the evening in a VIP section that is set
off from the rest of the club by velvet ropes.
</P>
<P>
   He said club patrons were searched and screened with a metal
detector, but neither he nor the club's owner, Michael Bergos,
could say how the guns got inside the nightspot. Neither man would
discuss the details of the shootings, citing the police
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The criminal complaint filed against Combs by the Manhattan
District Attorney's office said that a woman who witnessed the
shooting ``observed Mr. Combs in an argument with another group of
individuals inside the club, whereupon one of the other individuals
threw a stack of money at Combs.'' The complaint charges that Combs
and Barrow then ``each pulled out semiautomatic pistols.''
</P>
<P>
   The police identified the victims of the shooting as Natanya
Ruben, 29, and Julius Jones, 27, both of Brooklyn, and Robert
Thompson, of Danbury, Conn. Ms. Ruben, who was shot in the face,
and Jones, who was shot in the shoulder, were both in stable
condition on Monday night at St. Vincents Hospital and Medical
Center, said Mark G. Ackermann, a hospital spokesman. Thompson
refused medical attention, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The police said that after the shooting inside the club, Combs
and Ms. Lopez ran out and jumped into the car driven by Fenderson.
The car was pulled over on the corner of West 54th Street and
Eighth Avenue. The police found the gun under the front passenger
seat, the authorities said.

OPPORTUNITIES SLIP PAST STARS IN LOSS TO SHARKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ History, much like a leap in Pacific Division
standings, will have to wait another day for the Dallas Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Both were within reach against San Jose less than 24 hours ago.
And while Stars winger Brett Hull drew within a one-timer of
becoming only the 12th player in NHL history to score 600 goals, he
couldn't get the milestone and the Stars couldn't close the gap
between the themselves and division front-runners Phoenix and San
Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Hull's 599th of his career was the only Stars goal in a 3-1 loss
to the Sharks on Monday night at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way it's been going all year. They're not going in
as often, and not just for me, for everybody,'' Hull said. ``And
one goal isn't going to beat anybody in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 17,001, including a contingent of Cotton Bowl-bound
Texas Longhorns, witnessed Hull get another step closer to
catapulting himself into an elite society of 600 goal scorers. Only
11 players have reached 600, including a familiar name, Hull's dad,
Bobby.
</P>
<P>
   Hull scored at 10:22 of the first period, giving Dallas a 1-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   No. 599 was typical Hull goal, a slap shot from maybe five feet
atop the right circle. The puck screamed all the way to the net,
beating San Jose goalie Mike Vernon high and stick side.
</P>
<P>
   ``It did,'' Stars captain Mike Modano said when asked if Hull's
goal energized the team. ``It was a great shot. When those kind of
goals go in, I think everybody kind of starts to relax, take a deep
breath and play hard.''
</P>
<P>
   What could've been, should've been No. 600 landed in Vernon's
shoulder as did 24 of the Stars 25 shots. The team that is
averaging just over two goals a game couldn't get the second one
past Vernon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the same old story. We're not going to win very many
games scoring one goal,'' said Stars coach Ken Hitchcock, whose
team is fourth in the Pacific Division with 40 points. ``The
chances we're getting we're going to have to bury because they're
not coming fast and furious right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Dallas' best chance for goal No. 2 also proved to be
Hull's best chance for No. 600.
</P>
<P>
   Hull had a one-timer from about 12 feet away with 25 seconds
remaining in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just kind of went out and reacted, and it caught me in the
arm,'' Vernon said. ``I was probably a little lucky on that. He
tried to get it up on me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks have had most of the luck this season. In the four
meetings between San Jose and Dallas this season, the Stars have
scored only five goals, including three in their only victory
against the Sharks. The Sharks, meanwhile, have nine, including two
by San Jose forward Mike Ricci on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   He looked to be trying to reach 600 in a single game. Nos. 1 and
2 came in relatively quick succession in second-period action. His
first, a power-play goal, came on a perfect pass by Jeff Friesen at
3:11. His second looked like a golfer chipping from off the green
and handed San Jose a 2-1 lead at 12:48.
</P>
<P>
   What could've been, should've been his hat trick-making goal hit
the post with 1:05 remaining in the second period. Almosts and
could've beens were the story of the game for both teams.
</P>
<P>
   Ricci hit the post, but so did Sharks winger Ronnie Stern. Hull
hit the shoulder, but Stars forward Brian Skrudland missed an open
net with 2:30 remaining in the period as Ricci caught just enough
of the pass with the shaft of his stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's be honest, how many second and third chances did we
get?'' Skrudland said. ``We didn't get a lot of that.''
</P>
<P>
   A pretty solid defensive effort and a 23-save performance by
Stars goalie Ed Belfour kept Dallas within a slap shot of an even
game. No. 2 proved frustratingly elusive until Sharks forward Owen
Nolan made it pointless with his empty-netter with 5.9 seconds
remaining to seal another Sharks victory.
</P>
<P>
   Hull, maybe more than anybody, realized what one more goal
could've done.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is really no excitement at 599,'' Hull said. ``It's like
any other one.'' nn

GUN SALES SURGE WITH APPROACHING NEW LAW

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- With tough new gun laws taking effect Jan. 1, the
run on buying semiautomatic rifles hit full swing Monday as gun
enthusiasts lined up alongside those afraid of what the new
millennium will bring.
</P>
<P>
   Local gun dealers and law enforcement officials said there was a
rush to buy and register soon-to-be-blacklisted weapons. Come Jan.
1, California's gun laws will be among the toughest in the nation,
when new legislation goes into effect and broadens the definition
of assault rifles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sell every one of the semiautomatic rifles I can get,'' said
Bob Kahn, chief executive officer of B&AMP;B Sales, one of the San
Fernando Valley's largest gun merchants.
</P>
<P>
   Kahn maintains the new state legislation is unconstitutional and
similar to restrictions imposed upon residents in Nazi Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a panic. I can't get enough of them (the semiautomatic
rifles),'' he said. ``Everyone who can afford one is buying one.
People are scared this will be their last chance.''
</P>
<P>
   By midafternoon on Monday, Kahn had only one rifle in stock that
will fall under the parameters of the new state gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   The rifles targeted by the new legislation typically sell for
between $400 and $5,000, and Kahn said momentum has been building
for several months to buy them and ammunition magazines that hold
at least 10 rounds. The magazines also will be banned.
</P>
<P>
   ``These rifles are not assault rifles,'' Kahn argued. ``State
politicians and the attorney general have redefined semiautomatic,
look-alike assault rifles as real assault rifles to make people
hate and fear the guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Bill 23, which was co-sponsored by Speaker Antonio
Villaraigosa, D-Los Angeles, adds a ``generic'' definition to the
Assault Weapons Control Act of 1989, broadening the scope of the
gun control measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Passage of this law marks a historic milestone in
California,'' Villaraigosa said. ``It's time we put an end to
watching our loved ones die at the hands of killers who use assault
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assault weapons were made to kill people. They have no place
on our streets, in our communities, or in our schoolyards.''
</P>
<P>
   The state Attorney General's Office is offering to buy back any
rifles covered by the Jan. 1 ban, publicizing the money-for-guns
campaign in radio ads.
</P>
<P>
   Customers buying the weapons scoffed at the offer.
</P>
<P>
   At B&AMP;B, John Daily of Pasadena said he has no intention of
turning over his guns to the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``These new laws are illegal, and the people who passed them are
lawbreakers,'' Daily said. ``The Constitution gives us the right to
bear arms. If they want to change that, change the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   With time running out to legally purchase and register the
weapons, some gun shops are using the approaching deadline to
advertise the weapons and ammunition with the tagline: ``Banned
Jan. 1, 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the buying rush, other gun sellers and national
manufactures are drumming up business on all firearms sales by
playing on fears that the Year 2000 computer bug will lead to
widespread chaos and violence.
</P>
<P>
   For example, gun maker Wilson Combat advertises the Millennium
Protector .45 Auto as a good weapon to have handy for self-defense
``should the worst-case Y2K scenarios happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Kahn downplayed the Y2K fears, saying his customers ``aren't
stupid'' and know ``that's all exaggerated.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, his shop was bustling with customers on Monday,
while other potential purchasers waited patiently outside for a
parking spot to open up.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators, judging by the number of background
checks requested by licensed dealers, said gun sales have increased
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've run about a million background checks in total this
year,'' said Paul Bresson, a spokesman for the FBI. ``That's up
14.7 percent from last year's total. It's a significant increase.''

JETS BEAT DOLPHINS, 38-31 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ If this keeps up, the New York Jets will have a
quarterback controversy next season.
</P>
<P>
   For the second time in the last three weeks, Ray Lucas, former
grunt worker on special teams, outplayed Dan Marino, future Hall of
Famer. Lucas threw a pair of long fourth-quarter touchdown passes _
50 yards to Wayne Chrebet and 56 yards to Dedric Ward _ to seal the
Jets' 38-31 victory over the Miami Dolphins at Pro Player Stadium
tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas is 5-3 as the starter as he continues to learn on the job
left open when Vinny Testaverde's season ended in the opening game
with a torn Achilles' tendon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best win of the year for us,'' Coach Bill Parcells
said. ``It was gut-check time; this wasn't easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells said that if Lucas continues playing as he did on
Monday night, ``He's going to be dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets improved their record to 7-8, which tied them with the
New England Patriots. At the midway point of the season New England
was 6-2 and the Jets 2-6. The Jets have won six of their last eight
games, including three straight. The victory on Monday night also
enabled the Buffalo Bills to clinch a playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets finish their season on Sunday against the Seattle
Seahawks, looking to damage another team's playoff hopes after
beating Miami twice and Dallas in the last three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas completed 11 of 23 passes for 190 yards and 3 touchdowns
and has now thrown seven touchdown passes in the fourth quarters of
the last four games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long time coming,'' Lucas said of his opportunity
to excel as a starter. ``But I'm letting the game come to me and
I'm focusing on not making mistakes.'
</P>
<P>
   While the loss hurt the Dolphins (9-6), they are still in the
playoff race. Marino, playing in perhaps his final game here, was
29 of 52 for 322 yards, 3 touchdowns and 3 interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets led by 17-14 at halftime after Lucas did something in
his brief career he had never accomplished _ leading them to a
touchdown on their opening drive.
</P>
<P>
   It was a pretty piece of work that consumed almost seven
minutes. It featured a third-and-2 completion to Curtis Martin, a
third-down run for a conversion by Martin and a scramble by Lucas,
who drilled a 4-yard touchdown pass to Keyshawn Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   But the bad followed the good for the Jets. They were playing
without their leading tackler on special teams, Chris Hayes. And
his absence may have allowed the Dolphins to move into position for
a pair of touchdowns when they produced big returns on Jets
kickoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The first time Brock Marion returned a kickoff, for 30 yards,
Dwight Stone was penalized 15 yards for hitting below the knees,
giving Marino a shortened view of the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   In six plays he tied the score, capping the brief drive with a
1-yard scoring pass to a tight end, Ed Perry, who hadn't scored
this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets retaliated with another time-consuming drive that ended
with the longest field goal of the season by John Hall, a 48-yarder
that lifted the Jets to a 10-7 edge.
</P>
<P>
   Then Marino dipped into history. Mainly on his right arm, the
Dolphins sailed to the Jets' 2. Marino looked for O.J. McDuffie and
instead found Marcus Coleman, the Jets' cornerback. Coleman snared
the pass, eluded one tackler and raced 98 yards for the score.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just made a break and I had to be aware of where the ball
was,'' Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   This equaled a record for most interceptions returned for
touchdowns allowed by a team. It was seven, with Marino's five and
Damon Huard's two.
</P>
<P>
   But again the Jets allowed a big kickoff return _ 40 yards by
Marion. That set up Marino's second scoring pass, a 3-yarder to
Stanley Pritchett to cut the Jets' lead to 3 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets would have needed at least a dozen players on the
field, though, to prevent Marino's third touchdown pass shortly
after halftime. From the Jets' 32, he took the snap and tossed the
ball to Pritchett, who faked a run and instead pitched it back to
his quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Marino had Tony Martin open as the defenders had fallen for the
fake, and the quarterback simply waited for his receiver to reach
the end zone before launching a touchdown toss.
</P>
<P>
   Strange, but true, though, Marino was intercepted again as he
tried to get out of trouble while under pressure deep in his end
zone.
</P>
<P>
   This time, linebacker Roman Phifer got in front of a pass meant
for Pritchett, to bring the ball back to the Dolphins' 1.
</P>
<P>
   Three plays later Martin barreled over for the score, and the
Jets took a 24-21 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Marino has led the Dolphins on fourth-quarter comebacks before,
though. And now, after being denied a touchdown on a replay appeal
following a pass to McDuffie, Marino simply handed off to J.J.
Johnson from the 1. Johnson was hit, did a spin, and was propelled
into the end zone to give the Dolphins a 28-24 lead.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SAN ANTONIO _ After all these years of watching Penn State coach
Joe Paterno work wonders with the Nittany Lions, you sort of feel
like you know the man _ at least in terms of football.
</P>
<P>
   And so despite numerous similarities between Texas A&AMP;M coach
R.C. Slocum's first 11 seasons as head coach of the Aggies and
Paterno's first 11 with the Nittany Lions, you consider it safe to
say R.C. is no JoePa. Both are defensive-minded coaches with calm,
straightforward demeanors on and off the field. Both won their
100th collegiate game as head coach in their 11th season. Both took
their teams to nine bowls in their first 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   Paterno won 101 games in his first 11 seasons, Slocum 102.
Paterno took the Lions to nine Top 25 finishes in his first 11
years; Slocum took the Aggies to 10. Both put up more than one
undefeated regular-season record through their first 11 seasons
without claiming a piece of any national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Paterno was edged out in the polls in 1968 and 1969 despite 11-0
seasons both years. Slocum failed to earn title consideration
because NCAA sanctions left the Aggies bowl-less in 1994 (10-0-1)
and a Cotton Bowl loss to maybe the most talented Notre Dame team
ever left the Aggies 12-1 in the 1992 season.
</P>
<P>
   Paterno and Slocum are considered by their peers to be great
motivators. Both have coached at bona fide college towns with
eerily similar names _ State College and College Station.
</P>
<P>
   But the difference in Paterno's first 11 seasons and Slocum's
first 11 is as clear as the task facing the Aggies today in the
Alamo Bowl. These are the kinds of games Paterno always has managed
to win; Slocum's Aggies always have managed to lose them.
</P>
<P>
   It is why Paterno has been revered among the Nittany Lions
faithful almost from the moment he took over the reins. And it is a
big reason Slocum has been fighting off critics as recently as,
well, last month.
</P>
<P>
   If Slocum is to continue his legacy of winning at A&AMP;M and
finally move the Aggies from perennial Top 10 consideration to
perennial national championship contender, his bowl record against
higher-ranked teams must turn.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight is his latest great chance to stun the experts and
silence the critics. As it was in the 1992 Cotton Bowl against
Florida State, the 1994 Cotton Bowl against Notre Dame and the 1999
Sugar Bowl against Ohio State, the Aggies face a team that at one
point in the season was ranked No. 1 in the nation by at least one
major poll.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies have lost every time. Since 1992, Slocum's record in
the big bowls is 1-5, beating Michigan in the 1995 Alamo Bowl, and
losing the 1998 Cotton Bowl to UCLA, a team many considered the
best in the country at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're lucky and get a couple of breaks to help you win
games like this, then you might be on top when it's over,'' Slocum
said. ``Joe always produces a winner. He's the best at what he
does.''
</P>
<P>
   The struggle against the truly great teams is the shackle Slocum
must break. How ironic and coincidental it is that today Slocum's
struggle pits him against the legendary man whose career is defined
by such wins.
</P>
<P>
   No coach has won more bowls than Paterno's 19, beating every
great name the game knows _ Texas, Ohio State, Notre Dame, Southern
Cal, Tennessee. Along the way, Paterno has provided such memorable
upsets of previously top-ranked teams as a 27-23 Sugar Bowl win
over Herschel Walker's 1982 Georgia Bulldogs and a 14-10 win over
Miami in the 1986 Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Those two upsets gave Paterno his only national championships
and solidified his legendary status. Slocum has yet to contend for
the national title, and no one calls him a legend.
</P>
<P>
   If it's going to change, if Slocum is going to carry the Aggies
to the top of the college football world, he must beat teams like
the one the Aggies face tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the one thing I get hammered for as a coach, and you
take that,'' Slocum said. ``If you go back and check the opponents,
we've been the underdogs in most of those games and sometimes
pretty heavy underdogs. I don't think there's any question that
this year out of the Big 12 schools, we've got the toughest
opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt about it. The Aggies have seen these kinds of opponents
and opportunities. Penn State is the big favorite tonight, a team
that can claim to be one of the nation's best in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   If not for a last-second collapse against Minnesota, the Nittany
Lions could have been in New Orleans this week preparing for a
national championship showdown against Florida State. But the Penn
State faithful should not be worried _ Paterno has taken them to
the top, and so long as he's around he likely will take them to the
top again.
</P>
<P>
   As for Slocum, sooner or later he's going to have to win one of
these games.

HULL CLOSING IN ON CAREER GOAL NO. 600
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Brett Hull moved one one-timer, one slap shot, one
wrister closer to adding his name to the list of one of hockey's
most prestigious scoring milestones.
</P>
<P>
   With his slap shot from the top of the right circle that beat
sprawling San Jose goaltender Mike Vernon up high midway through
the first period, Hull reached goal No. 599 and stood on the cusp
of the magical No. 600, a feat only 11 players have reached, one of
Hull's father, Bobby.
</P>
<P>
   Vernon made sure the celebration would be postponed until at
least Wednesday when the New York Rangers come to Reunion Arena.
Vernon, who has surrendered 18 goals to Hull in his career, more
than only three other goalies, stoned the sharpshooter late in the
second period on a wide-open one-timer from the slot and shut out
the rest of the Dallas Stars for a 3-1 San Jose victory Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he was closing in (on 600). ``I'm glad he didn't get it
on me,'' Vernon said.
</P>
<P>
   Vernon might not have even seen the rifle shot that 17,001 at
Reunion Arena thought had to be the one. With 25 seconds remaining
in the second period, Hull sagged into the slot unobstructed,
standing about 12 feet from the crease. He took a centering pass
from the behind the net and blasted a one-timer that ricocheted off
Vernon's right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   The shot knocked Vernon down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' Hull said when asked it Vernon even saw it
coming. ``But, that's what goaltending is all about. You try to
move to the area you think it's going to be just like I try to
shoot where I think he's not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Again, that's the way it's been going all year. I don't score
for five games and we go undefeated. I get two in a row and lose
both games. Those are the little stats I ring up in my head.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull would not get another point-blank opportunity, but he made
the crowd gasp again with 47.5 seconds left and the Stars scrapping
to tie the game. Hull unleashed a slap shot from above the left
circle. The shot lined wide left, bounced off the board and
trickled into the crease in front of Vernon, who found the puck and
smothered it.
</P>
<P>
   Hull's next goal should make him the third quickest to reach
600, behind Wayne Gretzky (718) and Mario Lemieux (719). Hull's
next game will be the 899th of his career. It took Bobby Hull 1,031
games to reach 600.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to get it before 900 games, so I would like to
get it next game,'' Hull said. ``I think about it. I'd be lying if
I told I didn't know who's up there, like my father, Gretzky,
(Marcel) Dionne, (Steve) Yzerman. All of those are idols of mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments after his first-period goal, Hull teased the crowd with
a breakaway that was broken up before he could the shot off. Hull
said he could feel the excitement brewing as he inched closer to
history than he's ever been.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried to play my whole career to the crowd and play
entertainer,'' Hull said. ``After 898 games, I've got a feel for
their reaction.''

MRI REVEALS LITTLE ON NIEUWENDYK INJURY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ A magnetic resonance imaging exam taken on Joe
Nieuwendyk this weekend revealed that he has torn rib cartilage,
but he said it doesn't change the timetable for his return.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't really matter if I got an MRI or didn't get it,''
Nieuwendyk said. ``The fact of the matter is I have sore ribs. The
MRI just confirms what I already know. The game plan doesn't change
at all or my rehab, just when it starts to feel better. It's on
it's way. It's just a slow process.''
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk hasn't played since Dec. 11 against Edmonton. He said
that he suffered a similar injury only higher in his chest in the
first game of the 1996-97 season and missed 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is going to be six weeks. In fact, I'm
pretty positive I won't be six weeks,'' Nieuwendyk said. ``It's
just a very sensitive area, the ribs. ... I know it sounds crazy,
but when I sneeze, it almost drops me to my knees.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said Monday he's hopeful that
Nieuwendyk will begin skating Tuesday along with defenseman Shawn
Chambers (knee). DEFENSE BOOSTED
</P>
<P>
   With Shawn Chambers, captain Derian Hatcher and Kevin Dean out
with injuries, the Stars recalled rookie Richard Jackman from their
minor-league affiliate in Kalamazoo, Mich., Monday to bolster their
defensive corps.
</P>
<P>
   What a return trip it was. ``The guy beside me had a heart
attack on the plane,'' Jackman said. ``I was sleeping, and his wife
woke me up screaming. I went up and got a stewardess.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the flight, Jackman said he was happy to be back up.
Jackman has played in 11 games with the Stars, but mostly on the
power play instead of five on five.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five on five, most definitely, is one of the things I need to
work on,'' Jackman said. ``I think I've been working hard on it. I
think this is a really good chance to show what I can do.''
LEHTINEN UPDATE
</P>
<P>
   Stars winger Jere Lehtinen (ankle) practiced again Monday, and
Hitchcock said he expects him to return to the lineup in the next
couple of games.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars also expected Kevin Dean to return by next week. He's
unable to have contact for 5-7 days after suffering from an
irregular heartbeat during the Christmas holiday. Hitchcock said
Dean has been put on blood thinners and should be back in the
lineup for Monday's game against Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The players couldn't be coming back at a more important time as
the Stars began a six-game homestand Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at a stage right now where getting points is really
important because everybody in a push until the All-Star break,''
Ken Hitchcock said. ``It's not just winning games. It's winning the
right games that is important.'' HE SAID IT
</P>
<P>
   ``Nike swoosh, eh?'' Ken Hitchcock to Derian Hatcher after
looking at the gash on the back Hatcher's calf that looks
remarkably like the Nike symbol. DEFENDING THE CUP
</P>
<P>
   Stars forward Guy Carbonneau said injuries haven't been the
biggest problem in defending the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Say what?
</P>
<P>
   ``Our problem isn't the injuries. It's the length of the
injuries,'' Carbonneau explained. ``That puts more stress on the
other guys. I'm not saying Derian got hurt because of that. His was
a freak injury. But with Chambers' injury and Matty's bad knee,
Derian had to play 30 minutes a game. It didn't hurt his play, but
that put more stress on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Carbonneau said the amount of injuries the Stars have suffered
and the length of them has added stress throughout the lineup and
contributed to the team's struggles. nn

COWBOYS OWNER CHALLENGES TEAM LEADERS IN CLOSED-DOOR MEETING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ As many as 20 Dallas Cowboys veterans met with
owner Jerry Jones for about 20 minutes behind closed doors Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The mid-day meeting, called by Jones at his Valley Ranch office,
was described by those inside the room as ``passionate'' and ``to
the point,'' as a direct challenge was issued to the veteran
leadership on this team.
</P>
<P>
   Jones obviously is trying to jump-start a 7-8 Cowboys team that
received a reprieve over the weekend and again controls its own
destiny in battling three other 7-8 teams for the lone remaining
NFC playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the Cowboys have managed only to back their way into
playoff contention without being able to nail it down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry got his point across,'' safety Darren Woodson said. ``He
was the only one that talked.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody has ever questioned how passionate Jerry
is about the Cowboys and how passionate he is about winning,''
quarterback Troy Aikman said. ``That was reiterated for those who
maybe didn't know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Chan Gailey said Monday that his job this week as
motivator has been simplified by the playoff scenario that has
unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I have to do anything. I think it's been done
for us,'' Gailey said. ``I think what kind of opportunity this is
... is obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones' meeting, defensive tackle Alonzo Spellman said, ``wasn't
(a reading of the) riot act or anything like that. That isn't in
Jerry's character. He let us know that 1) we have the ability and
2) we have the opportunity'' to be a playoff team.
</P>
<P>
   The opportunity came in the form of a last-gasp chance to still
make the playoffs by beating the New York Giants, also 7-8, Sunday
at Texas Stadium, where the Cowboys are 6-1 this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our playoffs start this week,'' Aikman said. ``It's true. If
we win, we go. If we don't, we're done.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey's point is that nothing in the Cowboys' past can help
them now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we can depend on what has happened either of the
last two weeks to give us hope for Sunday's game,'' Gailey said.
``I think we go manufacture whatever it takes to win this game. We
have to look at it as the past is past; the future never gets here,
and all that matters is ``this'' game, ``this'' week. Nothing more,
nothing less.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said the Cowboys aren't taking it game by game. They are
taking it day by day now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been given new life,'' Aikman said. ``I believe the team
will respond and get it done. I believe everyone believes that we
can win (and get into the playoffs). If we didn't feel that way, we
shouldn't play.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Aikman admitted that he had the same ``optimism'' going
into games against the New York Jets and New Orleans Saints _
underdog opponents with nothing at stake but pride _ and the
Cowboys lost those games, 22-21 and 31-24, respectively, over a
span of six days last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Christmas Eve loss to the Saints left Jones feeling ``a
little foolish and stupid'' for the money and the effort that he
poured into signing high-priced talent during the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's fix this thing,'' Jones said immediately following
Friday's loss to the Saints.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Jones called a meeting to make certain that his veteran
players' mind-set is good.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have blown fourth-quarter leads in six of their
eight losses this season, including the Jets and Saints games.
Jones doesn't want anything more to slip away.
</P>
<P>
   Jones has never held a meeting like this after a loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``My career has been Jerry's career here ... (and) that's the
first time that he has done that,'' Aikman said.
</P>
<P>
   In the NFC, only the Arizona Cardinals, Atlanta Falcons, Chicago
Bears, New Orleans Saints, Philadelphia Eagles and San Francisco
49ers are eliminated from the playoff picture with one week
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what that says,'' Gailey said. ``It's not a
normal deal, that's what it says.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are trying to become the NFL's first 8-8 team to
make the playoffs since the 1991 New York Jets. The only time an
NFC team made the playoffs at 8-8 was the 1990 New Orleans Saints.

COWBOYS HAPPY WITH PLAYOFF HUNT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Yes, there were a few smiles at the Valley Ranch
training complex Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It was a stark contrast to how many of them felt days earlier
when the Dallas Cowboys believed their 31-24 Christmas Eve loss to
the New Orleans Saints had ruined their playoff hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Because his poor performance, namely two critical interceptions,
played such a large role in the outcome, Cowboys quarterback Troy
Aikman probably took it harder than most.
</P>
<P>
   The first interception came on a ball thrown behind receiver
Chris Brazzell, and it led to a Saints touchdown in the first
quarter. The second one came in the final minutes of the game when
he tried to force a pass to a double-covered tight end David
LeFleur in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very disappointing,'' Aikman said. ``It made for an
awfully tough weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the second consecutive tough weekend for Aikman, who
didn't play well in the 22-21 loss to Jets two weeks ago when he
completed just 12 passes of 28 passes for 158 yards and was
intercepted twice.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second worst performance of the season Aikman, whose
passing rating was 43.5 against the Jets. His rating for the season
is 78.1.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said Aikman's sub-par play is a result
of the quarterback trying to do too much. Aikman disagreed, saying
he's been playing the same way he always has. And though he was
disappointed with the final interception, he doesn't regret the
decision he made.
</P>
<P>
   ``My approach hasn't changed,'' Aikman said. ``I haven't tried
to do too much, nor do I feel I need to try to do more. I'm doing
the best I can. When you have an interception in the end zone, it's
tight down there. If you complete it, it's a great play. If the
opposition intercepts it, you are (ridiculed) for throwing into
coverage. That's part of playing the position.'' KEVIN SMITH
QUESTIONABLE
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Cowboys know they have something to play for
against the Gaints, the question is who will play.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest concern is at left cornerback. Will Kevin Smith, who
missed the Saints game and three of the previous four with a
strained hamstring, be ready to start opposite Deion Sanders?
</P>
<P>
   The Saints victimized replacements Charlie Williams and rookie
Duane Hawthorne for big plays Friday. The Cowboys probably can't
survive a similar performance.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is listed as questionable. Chan Gailey said he won't be
able to gauge Smith's availability until practice tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true for wide receiver Ernie Mills, who has missed
the past four games with a strained quadriceps. Mills, also listed
as questionable, said will try to practice tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   The situation at receiver, however, is not quite as crucial
because of the emergence of first-year receivers Jason Tucker and
Chris Brazzell. nn

3 HURT IN CLUB SHOOTINGS; PUFFY COMBS FACES GUN POSSESSION CHARGES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout)   (sw) 
 By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM(NU)   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sean (Puffy) Combs, the multimillionaire rap
entrepreneur whose career and lavish East Hampton parties have been
fodder for the gossip columns, was arrested on gun possession
charges with the actress and singer Jennifer Lopez after shots were
fired at a Times Square dance club early on Monday, the police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Three people were wounded in gunfire at 2:55 a.m. at Club New
York, sending panic-stricken clubgoers into the frigid air outside
the nightspot at 252 West 43rd St., the police and witnesses said.
The police described the victims as bystanders, and said that none
of them suffered life-threatening injuries. Neither Ms. Lopez nor
Combs was charged in connection with the shootings, and Ms. Lopez
was later cleared of any involvement and released.
</P>
<P>
   A rap performer who was in Combs' group, Jamal Barrows, 21, was
charged with three counts of attempted murder and criminal
possession of a weapon, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators later said they were looking into witness accounts
that Barrows fired because he believed that someone had said
something disrespectful to Combs. Prosecutors said a witness told
the police that Combs and Barrows were arguing with several other
people in the club and that after one of them threw a stack of
money at Combs, both he and Barrows pulled semiautomatic pistols
and Barrows fired. Prosecutors said at Combs' arraignment on Monday
night that he did not fire the weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Looking exhausted and disheveled at Manhattan Criminal Court
late Monday night after his release on $10,000 bail, Combs denied
he had ever had or drawn a pistol. ``I do not own a gun, I do not
carry a gun,'' he said. ``The charges against me are 100 percent
false and I feel confident that in the next couple of days I'll be
vindicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir said on Monday that Combs and
Ms. Lopez, who both fled after the shooting in a 1999 Lincoln
Navigator, had been arrested along with Combs' bodyguard and his
driver on gun possession charges, because a stolen pistol was found
in the vehicle. The gun found in the vehicle was not the one used
in the shootings in the club, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan District Attorney's office decided to release Ms.
Lopez. Officials said Ms. Lopez, who has appeared in nearly a dozen
films and has been romantically linked to Combs, was released
because she was unaware that the gun was in the car and because she
cooperated with the police.
</P>
<P>
   Combs, 30, who grew up in Harlem, rose from an intern at a small
rap record label to become one of the hip-hop world's leading
impresarios. His successful recording career led to his greater
success as a producer and promoter; he founded his own label, Bad
Boy Records, which he later sold to Arista Records for $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   But even as he became renowned as a rap mogul, Combs has also
had brushes with the law, most notably an incident earlier this
year in which he was accused of severely beating a record
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lopez, 29, was released about 4 p.m. from the Midtown South
Precinct station house. She did not speak with reporters, but her
lawyer, Larry Ruggiero, said: ``They established she did nothing
wrong. Jennifer had nothing to do with the gun or the shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   Also arrested on Monday were Combs' bodyguard, Anthony Jones,
34, and Combs' driver, Wardel Fenderson, 41. The police charged
Combs, Jones and Fenderson with criminal possession of a weapon and
criminal possession of stolen property, because the 9 mm Smith &AMP;
Wesson Model 915 pistol found in the Navigator was reported stolen
in August in Georgia, the authorities said. Jones was also charged
with marijuana possession, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the club investigators recovered four shell casings, two
from a 9 mm pistol and two from a .40-caliber gun, the police said.
The 9 mm casings were believed to have come from the weapon that
the police said Barrows was carrying when he was arrested. It was
not clear who fired the .40-caliber bullets, and no .40-caliber
pistol had been recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Eric S. Funk, the club's general manager, said Combs and Ms.
Lopez arrived with about 30 people sometime after midnight and
spent most of the evening in a VIP section set off from the rest of
the club by velvet ropes. He said patrons were searched and
screened with a metal detector, but neither he nor the club's
owner, Michael Bergos, could say how the guns got inside the
nightspot. Neither man would discuss the details of the shootings,
citing the police investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Combs and the three other suspects were arraigned on Monday
night and early Tuesday morning in Manhattan Criminal Court before
Judge Gabriel W. Gorenstein, who released Jones on $20,000 bail and
Fenderson on $2,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   Barrows, 21, was was held without bail after his arraignment
early on Tuesday morning on three counts of attempted murder. His
lawyer, Ian Niles, denied his client had shot anyone and said
Barrows intended to testify before a grand jury to explain his
innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said that a ballistics test on the gun Barrows was
carrying when he was arrested matched some of the spent shell
casings found in the club.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney Matthew Bogdanos asked for $100,000
bail for Combs, saying that the performer ``has a history of
violence.'' He sought bail of $50,000 for Jones and $25,000 for
Fenderson. Combs' lawyer, Harvey Slovis, said the witnesses who
told authorities that Combs had drawn a gun were lying.
</P>
<P>
   The police identified the victims of the shooting as Natanya
Ruben, 29, and Julius Jones, 27, both of Brooklyn, and Robert
Thompson, of Danbury, Conn. Ms. Ruben, who was shot in the face,
and Jones, who was shot in the shoulder, were both in stable
condition on Monday night at St. Vincents Hospital and Medical
Center, said Mark G. Ackermann, a hospital spokesman. Thompson
refused medical attention, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The police said that after the shooting inside the club, Combs
and Ms. Lopez ran out and jumped into the car driven by Fenderson.
The Navigator sped down West 43rd Street toward Eighth Avenue and
swerved around a marked police car, its dome lights flashing, that
officers had parked in the middle of the street to close off the
block.
</P>
<P>
   The Navigator sped north on Eighth Avenue, the authorities said,
running 11 red lights before it was pulled over on the northeast
corner of West 54th Street and Eighth Avenue. Combs, Jones,
Fenderson and Ms. Lopez all climbed out of the car and the police
found the gun under the front passenger seat, where Jones had been
riding, the authorities said.

THE FIGHTIN' AMOEBA SHOWS FEW SIGNS OF LIFE (For use by NYTimes
News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Much is missing at Valley Ranch these days, particularly in the
area of anatomy. Got no backbone at that place. Plus, no stomach,
no heart, no brain.
</P>
<P>
   As a functioning organism, the Dallas Cowboys are now classified
officially as amoeba.
</P>
<P>
   But in the National Football Conference, where forms of gridiron
life are best studied via microscope, the Fightin' Amoeba of
Irving, Texas, is still very much in the playoff chase.
</P>
<P>
   Some men see things as they are, and say why. I dream things
that never were and say why not the Stephenville Yellow Jackets
instead?
</P>
<P>
   Then again, why should Stephenville High School lower it's lofty
championship standards? Why take a step down by being our local
representative in the NFC playoff picture?
</P>
<P>
   By late Sunday afternoon, the holiday news had arrived for the
Cowboys. It was actually delivered by echo. Win a game and their
postseason reservations would be confirmed. What had been shouted
from the Texas Stadium rooftop for two weeks and two losses, stayed
exactly the same for the upcoming gigantic tilt against the New
York Giants.
</P>
<P>
   The only known problem here is that part about winning the game.
</P>
<P>
   Do remember that Kerry Collins, the Giants QB, wasn't good
enough to play for the Saints? This bodes well for Collins, since
Jake Delhomme was only considered the fourth-best quarterback in
New Orleans, until, of course, The Cajun Snake got his chance last
week against the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Losing to the Saints ranked as the lowest disgrace to date for
our gallant troops, even lower than losing the week before to the
New York Jets. Only in the NFC are losers continually rewarded with
one more chance.
</P>
<P>
   But the lone positive that came out of the Saints thing was
anger. Yes, somebody finally got mad. Sorta, anyway. Unfortunately,
however, that somebody was Jerry Jones, who was actually more
restrained than he should have been, seeing he wasted $41 million
this season in bonus and contractual money on these emotionless
stiffs.
</P>
<P>
   What tells us everything we need to know about the Cowboys is
the owner being forced to lead the way in a public display of
disgust. And Monday at Valley Ranch, Jerry apparently continued his
disgust, calling into his office some 20 veteran players for what
was believed to be a you-guys-stink session.
</P>
<P>
   Just once _ I said, ``once'' _ wouldn't it have been great to
hear Chan Gailey go off on a postgame tirade. It's way too late
now, but go back to the Eagles loss or the Giants loss in October,
and an unglued Chan would have been a welcome change.
</P>
<P>
   You know what they always say _ that a team will mirror the
emotion of its coach or manager. True or not, the Cowboys seem to
be living proof.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, what's exactly wrong with Gailey just being
Gailey? Is it proper to rip him for not having a fraudulent or
dishonest bone in his body? A lack of public explosions meant
Gailey resisted the temptation to become somebody he's not. Valley
Ranch already has enough frauds. It needs no more.
</P>
<P>
   Jones spent last week attempting to defuse the rampant talk
about Gailey's job security. Jerry was doing the right thing at the
time, but it backfired on him when the Cowboys promptly went out
and lost to the Saints.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, it seems safe to assume Jones is in a state of
confusion over whether to fire a coach he doesn't want to fire. But
if making the playoffs remains a criteria for Gailey staying or
going, the collapse of basically the entire NFC also cheapens that
judgment process.
</P>
<P>
   Lose to the Giants. Beat the Giants. It doesn't matter anymore.
The Jets game, followed by the Saints game, has already defined the
Cowboys, and defined those who play for the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   To quote Mr. Webster, ``any of various tiny one-celled
protozoans that lack permanent cell organs...''
</P>
<P>
   That's them, huh? That's our Fightin' Amoeba from Irving, Texas.
Void of backbone, stomach, heart and brain.
</P>
<P>
   This, frankly, is no longer about Gailey. Even if a new coach
comes in here for next season, he would still have to deal with the
protozoans who inhabit the locker room at Valley Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Protozoans? In the old days of the NFC they were also called
``Rams.'' But then they suddenly left St. Louis and moved here.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Webster again. ``Any of a phylum or subkingdom of
unicellular lower invertebrate animals that include some pathogenic
parasites...''
</P>
<P>
   Just as I thought. These protozoans suck up big paychecks every
other week whether they earned it not.
</P>
<P>
   So it goes in the small football world of the Fightin' Amoeba of
Irving, Texas. nn

PERENNIAL PLAYOFF TEAMS LIMPING TOWARD UNCERTAINTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Can you imagine the playoffs without the Dallas Cowboys, the San
Francisco 49ers and the Green Bay Packers? It would be like a New
Year's Eve party without tuxedos, champagne and Auld Lang Syne''.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the NFL's recent history, the Cowboys, the Packers
and the 49ers have been NFC playoff staples.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, the three teams made the playoffs in the same
season five times, resulting in 10 playoff meetings among them.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, since 1965, the three teams have missed the playoffs in
the same season only once _ in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   By default this season, either the Cowboys or the Packers likely
will get the NFC's final playoff berth to extend the streak.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, losers of three of their past four games, need only
to defeat the New York Giants on Sunday at Texas Stadium to qualify
for the playoffs for the eighth time in nine seasons. The Packers,
losers of three in a row, likely would get in _ based on net
conference points _ with a victory against Arizona combined with a
Cowboys loss to the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   But the team that eventually backs into the playoffs should
refuse the bid on principle. Neither team deserves to be in the
playoffs based on the merits of this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are old and tired. They could use a heart
transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, the Cowboys have not been a Super Bowl contender
since the 1995 season. It might be time for a rebuilding job such
as the one they undertook in 1989, which resulted in a 1-15 record
that season but a Super Bowl three years later.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers' season was done long ago _ as in a few years ago when
they mortgaged their future to win Super Bowl XXIX.
</P>
<P>
   Before this season, the 49ers had to pare $28 million from their
salary cap. San Francisco waived or traded nine key players, and it
lost three others to the Cleveland Browns in the expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the 49ers might be forced to say goodbye to Jerry Rice and
Steve Young. Rice will count $5.49 million against the cap next
season, while Young will cost $8.1 million. Their salaries would
contribute to the 49ers being about $18 million over the projected
salary cap for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Bill Walsh admitted last week that the 49ers
cannot afford to keep Rice and Young unless they renegotiate their
contracts. Postconcussion syndrome might end Young's career anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers cast their fate when they selected Ray Rhodes to
succeed Mike Holmgren. In four seasons, Rhodes destroyed the
Philadelphia Eagles. He was 30-36-1 in Philadelphia, including a
9-22-1 mark his last two seasons there.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers can finish no better than 8-8 this season. No Green
Bay team coached by Holmgren finished worse than 9-7 in seven
seasons, even though he inherited a 4-12 team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a bad team when I started here. This is worse,'' said
Packers strong safety LeRoy Butler, a second-round choice in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   A playoff berth will not cure what ails either the Cowboys or
the Packers. Still, the presence of either the Cowboys or the
Packers will make the playoffs more like the playoffs. For one game
at least, one of them will provide fans with a team to root for or
a team to root against.
GRADING THE NFL NFC playoff wannabes: F
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, the Giants, the Panthers, the Packers, the Bears,
the Lions and the Cardinals had a chance to solidify their playoff
status with a victory. They all lost. Either the Cowboys, the
Giants, the Packers or the Panthers will qualify for the playoffs
with an 8-8 record. Only once before in the modern era has a .500
team made the NFC playoffs in a nonstrike season. The 1990 New
Orleans Saints were 8-8. In the AFC, the Cleveland Browns won the
AFC Central title in 1985 with an 8-8 record, and in 1991, the 8-8
New York Jets qualified as a wild card. Tennessee Titans: A
</P>
<P>
   The Titans can stake a claim as the best team in the NFL after
Sunday's 41-14 rout of Jacksonville. Tennessee swept the Jaguars by
a combined 61-33, and the Titans also defeated the Rams, 24-21.
ADAM VINATIERI: D
</P>
<P>
   The New England Patriots kicker has made 24 of 31 field goals
this season, but he has cost his team two games and probably Pete
Carroll his job. Vinatieri, whose 32-yard attempt on the last play
against Kansas City on Oct. 10 hit the upright, was short and wide
on a 33-yard attempt with 2 seconds left in regulation Sunday
against the Bills and then misfired from 44 yards in overtime. The
Patriots (7-8) are below .500 for the first time since their 0-2
start in 1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Texas A&AMP;M running back Ja'Mar Toombs recalled a
moment four months ago when he got his first look at the Penn State
team the Aggies will play tonight in the Alamo Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was watching them on TV,'' Toombs said, ``and I thought,
`That's not a team that I want to play.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night's opponents _ each of whom entertained
national-championship aspirations _ would not have picked this date
and site to oppose one another, outside the Bowl Championship
Series.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M rose as high as No. 5 in the polls before losing 21-19 at
Texas Tech in early October. Penn State's lofty ambitions lasted
longer. The Nittany Lions rolled to a 9-0 record and were ranked as
high as No. 2 before a 24-23 loss to Minnesota sent them into what
would grow into a three-game slide after defeats by Michigan
(31-27) and Michigan State (35-28).
</P>
<P>
   But it appears that neither the Aggies (8-3) nor the Nittany
Lions (9-3) have approached this non-BCS bowl game with an off-hand
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   The fact they were playing Penn State got the Aggies' attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we kind of got lucky because we got such a great
opponent,'' A&AMP;M linebacker Brian Gamble said. ``About a month ago,
Penn State was in the middle of a national-championship race ...
They are still a great opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to play the big schools that are known for winning
and get some notoriety on the national level. That's what we are
looking to do _ play the best competition out there ... and let
people know we can play with the big boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Penn State's `big boys' also have added incentive to win _ they
don't want to be known as the only team that lost four consecutive
games under Joe Paterno. 34 seasons as Penn State's head coach.]
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the recruiting classes this team is made up of
that were one, two, three in the country,'' Penn State All-American
linebacker LaVar Arrington said. ``We can't go out there and lose
four straight. This is Penn State. If we lose, it's not going to be
for lack of effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Paterno said he has seen signs of that kind of intensity for
most of the 10 days the Nittany Lions have been in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a great week,'' he said. ``When we obviously didn't
get to do some things we had talked about at the beginning of the
year, we weighed how it would end up with something very positive.
When we were selected to come to the Alamo Bowl, there was some
concern what team we were going to play. When A&AMP;M became the team _
particularly after watching them do such a wonderful job against a
team like Texas _ the kids all of the sudden got excited about
coming. They were the ones who wanted to come down early and
they've worked with a purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of fine seniors who have had great careers who
certainly don't want to go out with four losses in a row regardless
of who we're playing. But playing a team with the tradition of A&AMP;M,
they've been very focused.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies also have the added incentive of boosting their
postseason reputation. A&AMP;M's lone victory in its past six bowl
games came here in a 22-20 victory against Michigan in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum contends too much is made of that recent
1-5 record considering that those five bowl losses have come
against Notre Dame (twice), Florida State, UCLA and last year
against Ohio State in the Sugar Bowl. But the players know about
the record.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're aware of it,'' junior offensive lineman Chris Valletta
said. ``I haven't won a bowl since I've been here. We definitely
want to win a bowl game. Not to just win a bowl game, but to boost
this program and our national status and show that we are a team to
be reckoned with and get back into the national-championship race
(for next season).'' nn

Arkansas' top receiver returns to practice after knee surgery 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ While it normally requires little more than a
sunrise to get Houston Nutt pumped up, the Arkansas coach seemed
particularly animated Monday when he said he is ``really excited''
about Anthony Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great to see him back out there, and I was amazed at
the way he moved,'' Nutt said. ``His situation has been a major
concern for us, and I really didn't expect him to be able to cut
and run the routes that well. He surprised us all.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas, the team's leading receiver and one of the premier deep
threats in the nation, underwent arthroscopic surgery Dec. 10 to
repair a damaged knee. The Razorbacks' opening Cotton Bowl workout
Monday was his first day back in pads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little winded,'' he said, laughing. ``I guess I'm a
little bit out of shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the knee feels fine, except for a little touch of
tendinitis. I'd say I'm about 90 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Ninety percent of Lucas, who averaged 22.2 yards per catch off
37 receptions for 822 yards and five touchdowns, could prove useful
when the Razorbacks face Texas on New Year's Day. After a '98
season in which he caught 43 passes for 1,004 yards (23.3) and 10
TDs, it was a slight letdown, but not bad considering he missed one
game and played hurt in several others.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really looked good today, but that's just the way he is,''
Nutt said. ``He has a tremendous work ethic and total commitment to
everything he does _ that's why he's already graduated _ and it
looks like he's recovered more quickly than we expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll definitely be out there Saturday. I don't know for how
long, but he'll be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas said he thinks it could be for a long stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went back for my two-week checkup,'' he said, ``and the doc
checked it all out, and did all those little doctor things with the
knee ... and finally, he said, `I like what I see.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Meanwhile, I'd been doing a few things of my own to help out.
I prayed, and worked my butt off.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas' initial injury came against Alabama in the third game of
the season, but he shrugged it off and continued playing right
through ``The greatest moment of my life up to now, at least in
football'' when he caught the touchdown pass that felled Tennessee,
28-24, as the Razorbacks avenged their most bitter defeat of the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
   But after back-to-back victories against Tennessee and
Mississippi State, the Razorbacks closed the season in Baton Rouge,
La., where they suffered a stunning defeat at the hands of a
woebegone LSU team and Lucas injured the knee again.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when I knew it was really hurt, because it wouldn't
bend,'' he said. ``Now, I know my knees, and they're not supposed
to be that way, and I figured I had a serious problem.''
</P>
<P>
   With the problem solved, Lucas figures he and the Hogs ready for
what comes. Maybe even the rumored visit from President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, if he's there, I hope he comes down to the locker room
afterward,'' Lucas said, ``because, you know, I've never met him or
anything, and that would be great. But I think we're going to be a
little busy during the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes ... the Longhorns. An aggregation about which Lucas has
learned much in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' he said, ``one thing I've learned is that there seems
to be something personal between Arkansas and Texas. Everybody's
talking about it up there, and I think there are a lot of people in
Arkansas who would rather beat Texas than anybody else.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a visit from (athletic director) Frank Broyles the
other day. You know, I really don't know that much about this
history of this rivalry, but he sure does. He talked to us about
what it had meant over the years, and I learned a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people who really want us to win this game
_ to whip Texas. And they're going to be awful disappointed if we
don't. They might even jump on us.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior, Lucas said he is ``a little disappointed, because I
wanted to set every (Arkansas) receiving record, and I didn't do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   His 137 receptions rank second, but he did set records for total
yards (2,879) and touchdown passes (23), and he set a Southeastern
Conference record by averaging 21 yards per catch over four
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a strange year, and we've had ups and downs,'' he
said. ``When we play the way we did against Tennessee, we're a
great team, not a 7-4 team. That's the way we need to play in this
game, because people have already chalked it up as an Arkansas
loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we can win, if we go out and play like Razorbacks.'' nn

SITTING OUT THE NEW MILLENNIUM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Sherry Joe Crosby 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES -- Pam Hunt knew she and her husband were destined
for a quiet New Year's Eve with the kids after they were unable to
find a single sitter available to work the most anticipated night
in a millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can find baby sitters especially this New Year's Eve,''
said Hunt, a Glendale mother of four who began her quest for
sitters in early December.
</P>
<P>
   Either because they can't find sitters or harbor Y2K fears, many
San Fernando Valley parents are celebrating at home with family and
friends.
</P>
<P>
   And those who have found baby sitters expect to pay double the
usual rates in exchange for a few hours of work. Rosalia Ramirez, a
44-year-old Van Nuys sitter with the Family Care Agency Inc. in
Reseda, plans to forsake the New Year's Eve festivities and work
the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody says you're crazy. I say, no I'm not,'' said
Ramirez, who expects to more than double her usual hourly rate from
$10 to $25 as one of half a dozen sitters at a corporate New Year's
Eve party near Los Angeles International Airport. About 100
children are expected to attend.
</P>
<P>
   And after all, reasoned Ramirez, there's no telling when the
next lucrative job might come along.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe tomorrow we have a job, maybe not. You never know,''
said Ramirez who also works full time as a nursing assistant at a
convalescent home for people with disabilities in Valley Glen.
</P>
<P>
   Requests for sitters on New Year's Eve were trickling in at
child-care referral agencies throughout the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're coming in slower and later,'' said Jennifer Hart, who
operates We Sit Better, a sitter and nanny referral agency in Van
Nuys. But Hart, who has been in the field for 30 years, said she
expects business to pick up come New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   ``On New Year's Eve people are begging and will pay anything,''
said Hart, who is charging $110 for a minimum of four hours for a
sitter on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   At the Family Care Agency, owner and operator Ilene Fletcher is
charging $35 an hour for a minimum of six hours for sitters on New
Year's Eve. Sitters who work the night will earn between $20 and
$30 an hour compared with their usual rates of $7 to $9 an hour,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money talks,'' said Fletcher, explaining how she managed to
persuade employees to work on what promises to be one of the most
eagerly anticipated nights of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is making money this New Year's Eve. At Sports
Plus Day Camp in Sherman Oaks, business is down considerably for
the program's annual New Year's Eve sleep-over party for children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's way down from years past,'' said Rick Weber, executive
director of the day camp which also offers sports activities, field
trips and recreational games for children ages 5 to 14.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the sleep-over party attracted 75 children. So far
this year, only about 25 have committed to the $50 event which
includes dinner, videos, snacks, games and breakfast the following
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents want to spend the New Year's Eve millennium with their
kids,'' concluded Weber.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Viviane Arakelian plans to do. A Glendale mother of
three, Arakelian said her family will usher in the new millennium
with relatives and friends at a rented hall in Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to spend the New Year's without my kids,'' said
Arakelian, who always spends the evening with her family but is
especially worried about this year's holiday. ``I'm not fearing
(Y2K technical glitches) but I'm worried that people in general are
going to make a mess out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   At Gymnastics Olympica USA in Van Nuys, which caters to children
ages 3 and older, officials decided to forego a children's New
Year's Eve party altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``More people are in town because they're afraid of Y2K
problems,'' said program director Bernadine Michielsen, who added
that last year's New Year's Eve party drew few tiny revelers. ``A
lot of families are doing things together and this year they
probably want their kids home with them.''
</P>
<P>
   And for couples daring to venture out, finding sitters at this
time of year will be especially tough, said Stacy Orbach,
children's services director of the West Valley Jewish Center in
West Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who do want to go out will have a hard time finding
baby sitters because they'll probably want to go out on New Year's
Eve,'' Orbach said.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Hayrapetian, 17, of Glendale is a prime example.
Although the teen has no firm plans for New Year's Eve, she knows
for certain she isn't going to spend it with a baby and affable TV
personality Dick Clark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only is it New Year's Eve, it's !ital!the!off! most talked
about New Year's Eve,'' said Hayrapetian, a senior at Hoover High
School in Glendale. ``Everybody is going to be out having fun. Who
wants to take care of a crying baby?''
</P>
<P>
   As for Pam Hunt, who failed to find a sitter for her children,
New Year's Eve will be a quiet one spent close to home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to spending New Year's Eve with my family
or spend the day with other families and go to the park and the
movies and then go home at 9 p.m. and say happy New Year's,'' Hunt
said.

KINGS NEED HELP FROM ROBITAILLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
LOS ANGELES _ Luc Robitaille will make the Hall of Fame. But will
he make the playoffs?
</P>
<P>
   It might be up to him.
</P>
<P>
   Five hundred goal scorers deserve their place in hockey history.
But during the Kings five-game losing streak, it has been difficult
to find Robitaille when the team so desperately needs him.
</P>
<P>
   With the season nearly half over and the Kings are not far from
the eighth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference, the
wakup call is out.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille clearly is the most popular player on the team and
with the Kings eighth sellout at Staples Center on Sunday, that
counts for something. But Robitaille's first line is reeling at the
worst possible time.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings might have played their two best defensive games in
losing 2-1 to San Jose on Wednesday and 3-2 in overtime Sunday to
Phoenix. Both are skilled offensive teams that were shutdown by a
club that just last week had given up 23 goals in three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your best defense can be a good offense,'' Kings coach Andy
Murray said. ``We need to be assertive on offense to take pressure
off the defense. We need to control the puck more. Right now some
of our top players are not doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray is reluctant to specifically address Robitaille's slump..
He knows Robitaille scored 39 goals last year and goals will make
the difference down the stretch. Murray also knows Robitaille's
linemate Ziggy Palffy has never appeared in a playoff game. Jozef
Stumpel, who centers the group, has been in just four.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a goal scorer,'' Murray said of Robitaille. ``That
doesn't just stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Robitalle, Stumpel (hernia) was sidelined for an extended
period with a major injury. Palffy recently missed three games with
a sore lower back and missed Tuesday's practice with the problem
flared up over night. It has hurt that Robitaille has played on
makeshift lines with Len Barrie, Jason Blake and Vladimir
Tsyplakov.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille never has been known as a gifted skater or playmaker.
He mixes it up in the middle and gets results.
</P>
<P>
   He always has been a study of perpetual motion around the net.
Now there is less movement and less chance to accelerate.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Coyotes, Robitaille scored just his second goal in 2
1/2 months, a stretch that included almost four weeks out with a
broken left foot. The goal came on his only shot of the night.
</P>
<P>
   But it was at least six games before the injury that Kings
watchers started to see a falloff from the form that earned
Robitaille the first NHL Player of the Week honors for the season.
He had 10 goals in the first six games. He has had two since.
</P>
<P>
   When he opened the season so well, there was a lot of attention
paid to his rigorous committment to conditioning, something he
rarely bothered with when he was young and lighting up the league.
</P>
<P>
   He is still lifting weight after a fever pace. Only how he looks
like a guy who will be 34 in February.
</P>
<P>
   During the Kings five-game losing streak, Robitaille has one
goal and one assist. Perhaps more striking is that the Kings never
have had the lead in any of those games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've hit a little bump on offense, but it's not fair
to put this on him,'' Stumpel said of Robitaille. ``We've had guys
hurt. Before it is done, he will have his goals.''
</P>
<P>
   WILL HISTORY REPEAT?
</P>
<P>
   There is a great fear that either Calgary or Edmonton will pass
the Kings for a playoff spot. Both are playing well and the Flames
goaltender Fred Braithwaite was named Monday as NHL Player of the
Week.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Colorado Avalanche can tell you, situations can
change like the weather in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the Avalanche, who host the Kings on Wednesday, were
muddling in a .500 season and having trouble asserting themselves
in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Then they went on a 12-game winning streak and didn't lose again
until February.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the Avalanche are just in about the same spot, around
.500, battling injuries and hoping to get their season going.
</P>
<P>
   What helps is a favorable schedule. They already have played 24
of their 41 road games and have started a stretch where 10 of 11
games are at home. Of course, it is uncertain whether the new Pepsi
Center constitutes a home ice advantage.
</P>
<P>
   During that stretch, the Avs play Nashville, Montreal,
Pittsburgh and Chicago. Their only road games is against the lowly
Blackhawks.
</P>
<P>
   Getting back Joe Sakic will help. When Peter Forsberg (shoulder
surgery) finally returned after two months, Sakic went out with a
rib injury. The Avs first line of Forsberg, Sakic and Adam
Deadmarsh triggered last year's winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Will it happen again. Probably not. But a strong showing,
beginning with Wednesday's game against the Kings could go a long
way to putting them back on top.

SHAQ STRIKES AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Don Nelson was in town again Monday, so didn't it
figure that Shaquille O'Neal's free throws would again be the focus
when Nelson's Dallas Mavericks played the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Except this time, Nelson saved his usual hack-a-Shaq tactics
until late in the fourth quarter. And O'Neal made him pay _ again _
leading the Lakers to a down-to-the-wire 108-106 victory at Staples
Center.
</P>
<P>
   In two November games against Dallas, Nelson made a mockery of
O'Neal's notoriously bad foul shooting by instructing the Mavericks
to grab him at every opportunity. This time, O'Neal shot just 10
free throws _ and made seven, including two when the Lakers needed
them most.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal hit consecutive free throws with 47.5 seconds remaining
to give the Lakers a 106-103 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mavericks' Michael Finley hit a 3-pointer at the other
end to tie the game, and it took two more clutch free throws _ from
Kobe Bryant, to give the Lakers the winning margin with 8.6 seconds
left.
</P>
<P>
   Finley missed a pull-up 3-point try to end the game, and the
Lakers kept their winning streak alive, extending it to nine
straight. It was more drama than anyone expected against the
Mavericks (9-20).
</P>
<P>
   ``It was what we call kind of a holiday mood,'' coach Phil
Jackson said. ``It's better to give than receive, and we almost
gave the game away.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal and Bryant saved it, scoring 35 and 25 points
respectively as the Lakers won for the 15th time in 16 games and
extended their dominance of the Mavericks to 19 in a row.
</P>
<P>
   And O'Neal seemed to enjoy punishing Nelson, especially with a
pair of free throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always do that,'' he said of hitting in the clutch. ``That
B.S. (fouling) will never work against me. He's lucky I missed 12
shots, because I was told to get 50 by the coaching staff.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal hit 14 of 26 from the field and added 14 rebounds and
three blocked shots but committed seven of the Lakers' 12
turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant again went through stretches of wildness, and struggled
to defend Finley (24 points, 12 in the fourth quarter), but he
finished 10 for 22 from the field and had nine rebounds and four
assists.
</P>
<P>
   So the Lakers, with the best record in the NBA at 24-5, also now
have the longest winning streak in the league this season. But just
barely.
</P>
<P>
   They squandered a 14-point lead in the first half, then had an
11-point lead when Bryant hit a driving layup with 6:51 to go in
the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Then Dirk Nowitzki went berserk. The Mavericks' German import
converted a four-point play and scored 19 of his team-high 30
points in the fourth quarter _ including 14 in the last 6:35. He
was 4 for 4 from the arc in the quarter, as the Mavericks hit 7 of
9.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defensively, we fell apart in the fourth quarter,'' Jackson
said. ``It started with the four-point play to Nowitzki, and boy,
he just caught us napping a couple times out there. And we were
ripe for a loss tonight, we escaped. I hope the guys understand
that, and I think they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Said O'Neal: ``We played down to their stinking level.... It's
not a win we should be proud of, but we won the game.''
</P>
<P>
   They owe it in part to another solid bench effort from Robert
Horry (11 points, eight assists, eight rebounds) and a resurgent
Ron Harper, who broke out of a month-long shooting slump to score
17 points on 8-of-9 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' collection of winning streaks seemed in jeopardy
early on, when the Mavericks abused the Lakers' second unit and cut
a 14-point lead to 52-48 by halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said he wasn't expecting an easy time from the
Mavericks, but he was committed to playing some of his little-used
reserves. He had been using an eight- to nine-man rotation for most
of the last three weeks, leaving Shaw, John Salley and rookies
Devean George and John Celestand on the bench. Even Rick Fox had
been seeing scant minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking of some of the younger players today that need
to play and need to have this opportunity regardless of the game,''
Jackson said. ``We've found a rotation that seems real comfortable
to us, and we're going to have to find a way to expand that a
little bit in the crush that January will bring again.''

TCU HORNED FROGS FALL AT HOME, AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ARTHUR GARCIA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The comforts of home are suddenly not. With
Monday night's 86-78 loss to Butler, TCU has lost consecutive
outings at Daniel-Meyer Coliseum for the first time in nearly four
years.
</P>
<P>
   Technicals and missed opportunities by the Horned Frogs and
timely baskets by the opposition led to an all-too-familiar
storyline for slumping TCU. The Frogs (7-6), who have dropped four
of their past six, hadn't lost back-to-back home games since their
days in the Southwest Conference.
</P>
<P>
   And adding insult to TCU's poor performance, Butler (6-3) won on
the road for the first time this season and scored a season-high.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to be playing on the road right now,'' TCU coach Bill
Tubbs said.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1996, the Frogs fell to Texas and Houston at
Daniel-Meyer in Tubbs' second year at TCU. For the next three-plus
seasons, TCU wouldn't drop consecutive home games _ a streak of 59
contests going into Monday night. It might seem like a modest
losing streak, but the Frogs' troubles at home might be symptomatic
of a larger problem.
</P>
<P>
   In all three of TCU's home T 8.55 ]pp 8.55 ]losses, which
already ties for the second-most home losses in a season for Tubbs
at TCU, the Frogs have self-destructed. Tubbs pointed to injuries
early in the season, and Monday night the entire TCU bench took
exception with the officials.
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs, however, said he was pleased with the Frogs' effort
Monday night and praised them for not quitting even though there
``were a lot of times we could have quit.'' But the veteran coach
can't be too pleased with their play, refusing to let any players
attend the postgame press conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we made mistakes,'' Tubbs said. ``I'm disappointed in
the game in a lot of ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Walk-on freshman J.R. Jones of Brewer, who had only played one
minute this season, made his first career start in place of
slumping Estell Laster and ahead of normal backup Thomas McTyer.
Jones played the first six minutes, and had two fouls a turnover
and an assist before giving way to McTyer.
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs said he started Jones ``because he plays hard, and we send
a few messages.''
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs again tried to jump-start the team at the start of the
second half, throwing Ryan Carroll into the fray. Carroll, the
Frogs' leading scorer, was supposed to be out for a couple more
games with walking pneumonia. He played 13 minutes and scored five
points.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs lost forward Derrick Davenport when he was ejected at
the 13:40 mark of the first half after receiving a pair of
technical fouls for arguing a foul call. After getting whistled for
charging less than two minutes later, Larry Allaway picked up a
technical for jostling with Butler center Scott Robisch. Bulldogs
guard Darnell Archey hit six free throws in the technical spree and
Andrew Graves hit a 3-pointer after the third technical, pushing
Butler's lead to 22-10.
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs said he couldn't remember the last time TCU players
received technicals for anything other than hanging on the rim.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs would lead for the remainder of the game, often
staving off TCU runs with a key 3-pointer or and offensive rebound
and put-back. Archey nailed a 22-foot 3-pointer at the shot-clock
buzzer midway through the second half after the Frogs pulled with
54-48 and Archey added a 3-pointer with five minutes to play again
getting Butler's lead up to nine.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For the past few days, National Basketball Players
Association executive director Billy Hunter has been busy placing a
``web of support'' around Mavericks rookie Leon Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in detail after Sunday's game in Sacramento between the
Mavericks and Kings, Hunter said he hopes to have the plan in place
in about a month.
</P>
<P>
   Under Hunter's plan, Smith will move to Houston and work out
with Moses Malone and some other former NBA players, and also
continue receiving his psychiatric treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter also said he may make some telephone calls to see if
another team has any interest in the 6-foot-10, 230-pound forward,
because he doesn't believe Smith will be treated fairly by the
Mavericks coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm setting up a training program for him,'' Hunter said.
``I'm going to move him out of Dallas and take him down to Houston,
and I'm going to have Moses and some more guys work out with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to get him together and see if somebody might be
interested (in trading for Smith) between now and Feb. 10. The kid
wants to play basketball in the NBA, so my ambition and the
ambition of the association is to see that that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith has been in a Dallas psychiatric clinic since Dec. 5. The
Mavericks suspended him without pay on Dec. 6 because of a series
of incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Smith left the league's player's assistance treatment program in
Atlanta early last month. On Nov. 14, he swallowed numerous pills
in a suicide attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Also, on Dec. 1, Smith went to Chicago's Marshall High School
and allegedly threatened his ex-girlfriend, Cappie Pondexter, with
a gun. Smith was arrested and charged with aggravated assault, and
had a restraining order to stay away from Pondexter.
</P>
<P>
   But on Dec. 3, shortly after his release from a Chicago jail,
Smith was arrested again after driving to Pondexter's home and
breaking the windows and ramming an automobile owned by her mother.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, Smith was in a Chicago courtroom facing charges
of criminal damage to property, violating an order of protection,
and aggravated assault. Circuit Court of Cook County judge Rita
Mary Novak ordered a continuance on the three charges, and Smith
must return to Chicago on Feb. 3 to face those charges.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the NBPA has until Jan. 5 to file a grievance on
Smith's behalf regarding the suspension handed down by the
Mavericks. Hunter said he's confident the suspension will be lifted
and Smith will be awarded back pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it turns out that we have any difficulties, then obviously
I've still got time to (file a grievance),'' Hunter said. ``But I'm
sure that things are pretty much under control.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can't get it resolved short of an arbitration, then
we're going to arbitration. And if the arbitrator rules in his
favor, then he'll make it retroactive from the moment that he was
suspended.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith grew up in several Chicago group homes, and was a ward of
the state of Illinois from age four-through-18. Smith has had two
run-ins with Mavericks assistant coach Donnie Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   However, Hunter said Smith, despite his troubled past, has a
tremendous upside.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's worth saving, and we're going to make every effort to do
that,'' Hunter said. ``I think he can make a contribution
somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to put a web around him and give him a support
network so that this is not going to happen again. I'm pleased with
the progress that he's made, and I think people are going to be
pleased themselves in the future when they see him.''

 GREEN CHRISTMAS FOR E-COMMERCE  &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Santa was a whole lot more computer savvy this year.
</P>
<P>
   Early returns indicate that online shopping between Thanksgiving
and Christmas met or surpassed most expectations and that a record
number of Web surfers did at least a portion of their gift buying
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a good Christmas online,'' said Lisa Allen, an
analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I visited a lot of sites, and many were out of stock,'' she
observed. ``That's an indication that traffic has been good and
that sales have been good.''
</P>
<P>
   It also suggests that more than a few online shoppers found the
experience somewhat frustrating, but Allen said this only shows
that the Net is prone to the same snafus as brick-and-mortar retail
outlets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frustrations related to shopping at Christmas are as common as
fruitcakes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street wasn't as accommodating. Leading Internet stocks
took a hammering Monday as investors questioned the post-holiday
outlook for many e-tailers.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com slid 10 percent to close at $81.13, and eToys
plummeted 16 percent to $25.94.
</P>
<P>
   While it's still too soon to say with any precision how many
people made online purchases this season or to determine how much
they spent, Allen said she remains comfortable with Forrester's
estimate that holiday e-tailing will total about $4 billion this
year.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for market researcher Jupiter Communications in
New York said no figures related to the current holiday season will
be available before next week. But she stood by Jupiter's earlier
projection of $6 billion in online sales.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, a lot of guesswork is involved in determining
how much e-commerce actually is transpiring out in the ether. The
Gartner Group's Dataquest unit predicted that online sales would
total $8.6 billion this season, while consulting giant Ernst &AMP;
Young has put the figure as high as $15 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever figure you prefer, it's still a drop in the bucket
compared with the full $750 billion Americans were projected to
spend from October to December this year.
</P>
<P>
   With shipping a factor, at least it can be said with some
certainty that the Net was no place for last-minute shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   A survey by Goldman Sachs/PC Data Online found that online
purchases reached critical mass in the week of Dec. 6, totaling
$1.2 billion. Sales tapered off in subsequent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be interesting to watch whether we see a jump in
online retail this coming week as buyers begin the search for
post-Christmas sales,'' said Cameron Meierhoefer, an analyst with
PC Data Online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Post-holiday consumers look specifically for bargains and will
look to see whether online retailers are ready to compete with
their brick-and-mortar competitors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For many e-tailers, it was a victory to have made it through the
holidays relatively unscathed. Last year at this time, many online
merchants were still reeling from crashed servers, insufficient
inventories and missed deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Clara's Yahoo not only survived this season, but saw the
number of holiday sales at its site increase by more than 385
percent from a year before. (However, the company won't give a
dollar amount for these purchases, so it's unknown whether visitors
were buying platinum or Pokemon.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was optimistic, but the sales exceeded our
expectations on all counts,'' said Jennifer Dulski, the ``brand
manager'' for Yahoo's shopping channel, an online mall that says it
contains ``thousands'' of stores, including Eddie Bauer,
Williams-Sonoma and Victoria's Secret.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com came out on top in terms of most frequently visited
sites during the holiday season, according to statistics tabulated
by Media Metrix. It was followed by eBay, eToys, Toysrus.com,
Barnesandnoble.com, Buy.com, CDNow, Expedia, eGreetings and
Travelocity.
</P>
<P>
   At New York's Bluefly.com, an online purveyor of discount
designer duds, Executive Vice President Jonathan Morris said most
Internet merchants learned their lessons from last year's
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing for most was just keeping the site up and
running with the holiday crush,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Bluefly's case, this was done by adding 20 additional Web
servers to handle the surge in traffic. And the investment paid
off. Morris said the company did more business on December 12 and
13 alone than it did in the entire fourth quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``E-commerce has become less of a novelty and more of an
accepted form of purchasing,'' he said. ``It's part of the American
culture now.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, as the number of people shopping online grows, many are
discovering that e-commerce continues to have its limitations.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco investment bank Robertson Stephens said Monday
that according to its survey of e-tail trends, online shopping
satisfaction deteriorated as Christmas approached.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deterioration is consistent with our hypothesis that peak
periods of demand would expose infrastructure weakness of young
e-tailers,'' said analyst Lauren Cooks Levitan.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's Toys R Us didn't win any friends when it sent out
e-mail to some customers last week saying their online orders would
not be processed in time for Christmas. It offered $100 coupons to
compensate for this not-so-merry setback.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, a Chronicle reporter came up empty-handed after
attempting to purchase a few holiday goodies for a pair of
overindulged cats. After dutifully registering and filling out
forms at San Francisco's Petopia.com, he was surprised to find that
the site refused to accept his order.
</P>
<P>
   A customer service representative subsequently admitted that
many other shoppers were being turned away at the virtual checkout
line and that the company wasn't sure what the problem was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the Web is just too crowded,'' she offered.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester's Allen said she wasn't shocked by this and other
e-commerce horror stories she'd heard. She predicted that more than
a few online merchants would stumble and fall in coming months as a
result of not meeting customers' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``E-commerce is past the experimental stage,'' Allen said, ``but
it's not completely shaken out yet.''

S.F. BAY AREA HOSPITALS TEAM UP
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     and KEN HOOVER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ Oakland's Summit Medical Center merged with
Berkeley's Alta Bates Medical Center Monday, just five hours after
a federal judge denied California Attorney General Bill Lockyer's
legal bid to block the merger.
<P>
   Monday's ruling by U.S. District Judge Maxine Chesney brought a
swift conclusion to a deal that had been delayed for a year by
antitrust concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The merger had attracted intense scrutiny because it proposed
bringing together the East Bay's two largest hospitals, a move
critics said would give them the power to raise prices.
</P>
<P>
   With Chesney's ruling in hand, the two hospitals immediately
closed their deal Monday to make further legal challenges more
difficult and less likely.
</P>
<P>
   Lockyer's office expressed disappointment. ``We think the
decision is bad for consumers,'' said Lockyer spokeswoman Sandra
Michioku, declining to comment further until her boss had analyzed
Chesney's decision.
</P>
<P>
   The merger was first proposed more than a year ago as a way to
prop up financially troubled Summit by merging it into Alta Bates,
which is already part of the Sutter Health hospital chain based in
Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission ended an investigation of the deal
in July without taking any action.
</P>
<P>
   But in August, Lockyer tried to halt the deal by filing an
antitrust lawsuit in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   During a trial in October, state attorneys argued that merging
the combined hospitals would give them a 50 percent market share in
a region spreading from the Carquinez Strait to Hayward and from
San Francisco Bay to the Oakland-Berkeley hills.
</P>
<P>
   But in a terse order that gave no hint of her reasoning, Chesney
denied Lockyer's request for a preliminary injunction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having fully considered the matter, the court hereby denies
the motion (for preliminary injunction),'' Chesney wrote, without
elaboration. She promised to publish her full decision ``shortly,''
saying she had issued yesterday's order ``given the time
constraints under which defendants are operating.''
</P>
<P>
   Summit administrators had testified during the trial that they
would run out of cash by the end of the year unless the merger was
allowed. Yesterday, Summit chief executive Irwin Hansen issued a
statement saying he was ``extremely pleased'' with the decision.
</P>
<P>
   By merging with its Berkeley neighbor, Summit becomes the 27th
hospital in the Sutter chain.
</P>
<P>
   Chesney's decision is a setback for the Service Employees
International Union Local 250 in Oakland, the deal's leading
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this merger would create a monopoly, driving up the
cost of health care, decreasing services, and cutting access to
care for the poor and uninsured,'' said SEIU President Sal
Rosselli.
</P>
<P>
   At both hospitals yesterday afternoon, some employees shrugged
off the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it's good for the patients and the employees,'' said
Brenda Drayden, office manager in respiratory care at Alta Bates.
``I know they have been having financial difficulties at both
hospitals, and hopefully this will alleviate that.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she had not heard of any discussion about layoffs or
cuts in service.
</P>
<P>
   Another Alta Bates employee, who declined to give her name,
said, ``I like the situation the way it is now.'' She also said
that even though no one had mentioned it, she was worried about her
job.
</P>
<P>
   Several doctors at Summit, however, expressed relief upon
hearing of the judge's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise, there would have been a fire sale'' if Summit had
been forced to seek a different merger partner, said Dr. Mervin
Sahud, who has been at the hospital for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing the view of other physicians, he said the federal
government does not understand the problems that hospitals like
Summit have caring for low-income patients.
</P>
<P>
   However, Dr. Robert Feldman said that while the merger might
help in the short run, it might actually hurt the hospitals in the
long run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will result in too much market share for the
combined entity,'' he said. ``As a result, the hospitals will not
be forced to operate efficiently, and this will reduce their
ability to compete with, for example, Kaiser.''
</P>
<P>
   Alameda County Supervisor Keith Carson, whose district
encompasses Berkeley and Oakland, said the merger is only the first
of several big changes coming to the East Bay hospital scene.
Kaiser has proposed shutting down its Oakland hospital and
diverting Kaiser patients to Summit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned about access to emergency care, and the ability
to find a hospital bed at the height of flu season,'' he said.

FINDING WORK STILL HARD FOR DISABLED
</HEADLINE>
  (Includes color photo of man in wheelchair working at computer and
a graphic sidebar) 
 By JANINE YOUNG SIKES 
 c.1999 NYT Regional Newspapers 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the nine years since Congress passed the Americans with
Disabilities Act, businesses and the government have improved
access for individuals with disabilities by installing wheelchair
ramps, handicapped-accessible restrooms and automatic door openers.
</P>
<P>
   But while it's infinitely easier for a person in a wheelchair to
go shopping or attend a sporting event than it was a decade ago,
it's still no easier for a person with a disability to land a job.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 17.4 million Americans between the ages of 16 and 64 who
have disabilities, about 70 percent are not in the labor force,
according to a 1997 survey by the U.S. Bureau of the Census. Even
record low unemployment doesn't seem to be opening doors for the
disabled. Their unemployment rate, 13.6 percent, is more than three
times that of the general labor force. Unemployment rates are based
on the number of people who are actively seeking a job and do not
take into account those who have given up trying.
</P>
<P>
   ''In general, the unemployment rate for people with disabilities
has not changed much at all,'' said David Keer, rehabilitation
program specialist at the National Institute on Disability and
Rehabilitation Research in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The interview process alone can be a nightmare, said Rick
Nelson, who has muscular dystrophy. While most applicants are
quizzed about their qualifications, the disabled are questioned
about their disability.
</P>
<P>
   ''The conversation immediately centers around the wheelchair,''
said Nelson, who works at the University of Florida in its textbook
on tapes program. ''That can be said for any of us who have a
visible disability.''
</P>
<P>
   The ADA, passed in July of 1990, prohibits employers from
discriminating on the basis of disability and requires employers to
provide ''reasonable accommodations,'' such as raising a desk to
fit a wheelchair or modifying a work schedule.
</P>
<P>
   But it's difficult to legislate attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The perception by employers is that if you have a disability,
you don't want to work,'' said Johnny Watson, who has been confined
to a wheelchair since 1993. ''People just have an inner
prejudice.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson, whose spine began to deteriorate 10 years ago, was able
to land a part-time position with an agency that works with the
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   But in general, employers still don't understand how capable
disabled people are, said Ken Osfield, director of ADA compliance
for Administrative Affairs at the University of Florida. ''They
might use a wheelchair, use a guide dog or be without a hand,''
Osfield said. ''It doesn't mean that they can't do some things. It
just means they might have to do things differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Some employers may shy away from hiring workers with
disabilities because of the cost associated with making required
modifications, said William Kennedy, program director at the Center
for Independent Living of North Central Florida, the not-for-profit
agency for which Watson works. But the cost to raise a desk or
retrofit a bathroom is often less than most people think, typically
running from about $500 to $2,000, according to Kennedy. And the
accommodation could be as little as allowing the worker to adjust
his work schedule so that it doesn't interfere with doctor
appointments.
</P>
<P>
   Since employers haven't gotten the message, President Clinton
last year established a task force to look into the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the ADA, we thought discrimination would be gone in the
workplace,'' said D.J. Hendricks, with the Job Accommodation
Network based in Morgantown, W.Va., a service established by the
president's task force. The network takes calls from the disabled
and from employers who want to learn how to accommodate different
kinds of disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately, we are still hearing from people who feel that
they are being discriminated against,'' Hendricks said.
</P>
<P>
   Just as civil rights legislation took decades to have real
impact, ADA will require more time to accomplish its mission, said
Donna Smith-Whitty, an ADA information coordinator for the
Coalition for Citizens with Disabilities in Jackson, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've made some major leaps,'' said Smith-Whitty. ''But it's
still a changing process.''
</P>
<P>
   During the next three years, the federal government is expected
to step up its recruitment of workers with disabilities and develop
programs to increase employability in the private sector. Other
federal agencies are trying to facilitate reward programs for
employers who make accommodations and to increase awareness of
career options for people with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   But the economy might take care of the problem on its own. If
workers become scarce enough, employers may be forced to consider
this overlooked labor pool.
</P>
<P>
   ''Employers can't afford to overlook this volume of workers,''
Smith-Whitty said. ''If they do, they are just throwing away a
great amount of knowledge and expertise.''

WORLDWIDE PLANT EXTINCTION IS ACCELERATING
</HEADLINE>
  By SALLY DENEEN and TRACEY C. REMBERT

<TEXT>
<P>
   Janet Marinelli trekked more than 13 miles a day along the ocean
beaches of Long Island in search of a particular wild amaranth, a
plant everyone assumed had been extinct for 40 years until, out of
the blue, news reports started coming in that the plant had
reappeared in, of all places, New York. Her feet sinking into the
pillows of sand with each step, Marinelli wanted to see the annual
plant for herself. Would it be back?
</P>
<P>
   Stopping every three or four miles for a break, she and a
colleague trudged on, until finally noticing something poking out
of the sand in a spectacular stretch of Hamptons beach. ''It was
really one of the biggest thrills of my life,'' recalls Marinelli,
director of publishing at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the thrill was dampened. ''It was wild amaranth, but it had
just been squashed by a four-wheel-drive vehicle,'' Marinelli says.
It was an epiphany. Here she was, standing above this little mound
of a plant measuring about a foot across, with fleshy red stems and
spinach-green leaves clustered at the tips of the branches. And not
just any plant, but one whose high-protein family is considered a
very important staple crop. Marinelli was looking at a plant that
ideally could be used to hybridize with the grain amaranth to
produce much bigger grains. Produce better food. Here it was. And
it had been flattened. By a car.
</P>
<P>
   ''This plant became a symbol to me of our attitude toward
nature,'' says Marinelli, who recounted her journey to find the
seabeach amaranth in her 1998 book, ''Stalking the Wild Amaranth:
Gardening in the Age of Extinction.'' A National Crisis
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice if Marinelli's story were an anomaly. Yet a
resounding one in eight plants worldwide is threatened with
extinction, according to the 1997 World Conservation Union (IUCN)
Red List of Threatened Plants, representing a 20-year worldwide
research effort. That's one in eight.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the outlook is even worse: Nearly one in
three plants known to exist is at risk. That's 29 percent of the
nation's 16,000 known flowers, ferns and conifers at risk of
extinction (many of which are not protected under the federal
Endangered Species Act). And these are extinctions of known plants.
What about plants not yet discovered by scientists?
</P>
<P>
   ''The numbers are staggering, not only because they are
exceedingly large, but because we are talking about the organisms
on which all animal life depends,'' says David Brackett, chairman
of IUCN's Species Survival Commission. ''Plants clothe us, feed us
and our domestic animals, and provide us with most of our
medicines, yet our knowledge of their status is woefully
inadequate. This needs to change. We need to invest in botany. We
cannot afford to neglect the fate of the world's plants.''
</P>
<P>
   To Leslie Landrum, the plant crisis is akin to having all of the
world's books that ever will be published in one room, many
uncatalogued, ''and there's a fire at one end of the room.'' Plants
are ''disappearing before we even get a chance to figure out what
they are,'' says Landrum. As curator of Arizona State University's
herbarium, she is helping catalog about 100 new species a year in a
state that has reportedly transformed desert into development at a
rate of one acre a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the days of the dinosaurs did so many species face
extinction so quickly, notes botanist Paul Alan Cox. He contends
that several generations from now, geologists will not be able to
distinguish such a mass extinction from the effects of an asteroid
strike.
</P>
<P>
   ''I calculate that we're losing one plant species every week,
globally,'' says Cox, director of the National Tropical Botanical
Garden and a botanist who shared a prestigious Goldman
Environmental Prize in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ''Talk about pulling rivets out of the lifeboat. They're flying
out like crazy right now.''
</P>
<P>
   It's interesting to put this in human perspective. For every
1,000 people you see, three are likely to die from the nation's
biggest killer: heart disease. For every three known members of the
lily family, however, one is threatened with extinction. Your
chances of dying this year are one in 561 if you're a 25-year-old
white man. Your chances of going extinct if you're a member of the
iris family is one in three.
</P>
<P>
   The point is this: Maybe the next plant that goes extinct
harbored a cure for heart disease. A quarter of prescription drugs
contain some sort of component or synthesis from plants, including
aspirin from the willow family, glaucoma-fighting pilo carpine, and
cancer-battler Taxol from the Pacific yew. Three out of four
members of the yew family are threatened; so are one in eight
willows.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe last year, we lost the cure for Parkinson's disease;
maybe this week, breast cancer. We don't know. Less than one
percent of the world's plant species have ever been studied for
medicine,'' says Cox, who comes from a long line of
conservationists, including a great-grandfather who founded Arbor
Day and a grandfather who founded Utah's state park system. ''Every
time a botanist goes into the rainforest and collects 100 different
specimens, one, on average, turns out to be new to science.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox speaks frankly, with a clear tone of eagerness, as he's on
the frontlines of the extinction battle. On the island of Samoa,
his work resulted in the discovery of a plant derivative,
prostatin, that has shown promise in treating AIDS. These days, Cox
is at ground zero on the U.S.' extinction front--Hawaii, home to
one-third of the nation's at-risk plants, 263 of which receive
protection under the federal Endangered Species Act. No other state
has more.
</P>
<P>
   As with endangered wildlife, ''habitat loss is the biggest
threat facing plants,'' contends Bruce Stein, a botantist and
director of scientific publications at The Nature Conservancy.
''That threat can be direct destruction _ like the conversion to
agricultural lands, development, or clear-cutting. But a disruption
of natural processes is also a problem. Periodic burning is
required by many ecosystems to stay healthy. Smoky the Bear has
been very effective in stopping this, and as the brush builds up on
forest floors, it crowds plants _ sometimes affecting the rare
species that used to thrive there.''
</P>
<P>
   Many plants around the world no longer re-seed and remain lone
survivors _ dubbed ''the living dead.'' At San Francisco's Golden
Gate Park, the Presidio manzanita is so rare that park officials
decline to reveal where the plant is located. It is down to one
plant in the wild. While cuttings have been nursed into 15 other
plants, they can't self-fertilize. In essence, they're like Dollie
the sheep. ''They're all basically clones of the same individual,''
says Marc Albert, natural resource management specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Botanist Wendy Strahm, a Switzerland-based IUCN Plants Officer
in its Species Survival Programme, sees plenty of ''the living
dead'' on the Indian Ocean's Mascarene Islands. One palm tree, the
Hyophorbe amaricaulis is down to ''one lonely individual,'' she
reports. Strahm fears a cyclone will do it in.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, ''the extinction crisis is very real,'' Strahm says.
''We have an extensive list of species on the brink of extinction,
plants we will lose in the next century, unless action is taken
now. If we cannot conserve the great majority of plant species that
exist on this planet today, it will be us that will be heading for
extinction.''
</P>
<P>
   She adds, ''People rely on plants for our most basic needs. If I
were dying from cancer, or AIDS, or the Ebola virus, I would be
very interested in having the right treatment, and would not be
happy if that treatment had already become extinct.''

 &HT;    No tolerance for terror
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Happy New Year. Toot. Cheer. Hug. Boom.
</P>
<P>
   If Americans are harmed celebrating the millennial holidays that
mark the birth of the Christian savior, the United States should
treat the crime as an act of war.
</P>
<P>
   Americans should not live in fear that they will be bombed,
poisoned, gassed or kidnapped by anti-American terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   That's what terrorists want.
</P>
<P>
   They want to bring down the mighty. They want to see Americans
cower in fear. They should never get the chance.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has warned Americans to watch out for
terrorism over the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   The holidays are a time for giving and love for all. It is a
time for celebrating new beginnings in the shared happiness of
friends and friendly crowds.
</P>
<P>
   The holidays are not supposed to be a time to stay on the alert
for slimeballs who want to kill you and destroy your way of life.
</P>
<P>
   According to the latest government warning, ``The U.S.
government believes that terrorists may be planning to conduct
attacks, including against official and non-official Americans, in
and around the New Year period, from now through mid-January
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Regrettably, the warnings by Clinton and other high-ranking
government officials in charge of national security are necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials don't want to panic Americans. But they
would be ducking their responsibilities if they failed to give
adequate warnings of actual threats.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago in Jordan, an anti-American terrorist cell of
Islamic extremists was arrested in time to prevent a plan to kill
Americans and Israelis during celebrations on the eve of the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The group supposedly was under the control of exiled Saudi
billionaire Osama bin Laden, the committed anti-American terrorist
indicted for the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Intelligence Agency speculates that bin Laden and
his associates could be planning 15 other similar attacks
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   United States border crossings now are on high alert after U.S.
Customs officers in Port Angeles, Wash., arrested Ahmed Ressam, a
32-year-old Algerian-born man with ties to bin Laden and the
Algerian extremist organization, Armed Islamic Group.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam was smuggling sophisticated and powerful bomb-making
material into the United States from Canada in his rented car.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam is not talking, but it is apparent that he was just
dropping off the nitroglycerin, timing devices and other materials
to other terrorists already in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden is making himself comfortable in Afghanistan, a county
now run by the Islamic fundamentalist Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
   Many of bin Laden's ``associates'' were armed and assisted by
the CIA during the war that eventually drove the Soviet Union out
of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden and his associates now have declared a holy war on the
United States and Americans anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Two can play that game.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's bin Laden or any other terrorist group, domestic or
foreign, the United States should never allow terrorists to force
Americans to live in fear. When that happens, the terrorists have
won.
</P>
<P>
   It must be remembered that the greatest act of terrorism on
American soil was the homegrown terrorist bombing of the federal
building in Oklahoma City in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   America has its own share of terrorist hate groups and dangerous
loners.
</P>
<P>
   Americans should continue with the holiday plans aware, but
unafraid, of the threat.
</P>
<P>
   However, if terrorists harm Americans during the holidays, the
United States should take off the gloves and treat the outrage as
an act of war.

 &HT;    Y2-Kay! Y2-Lillian! Sisters salute each other
 &HT;    (EDS: Photos available.)

<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Truth be told, the ladies will not be
going out.
</P>
<P>
   New Year's Eve, the Real Big Deal, the night the nines turn to
zeroes, will come and go and Kay Rose, 94, and Lillian Ferraro, 86,
will be sitting right here, shoulder-to-hip on their plump couch,
trying to remember their memories. Alone together, as they like to
say.
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't always so. Old days, back in Haverstraw, N.Y., the old
bricktown on the Hudson, a Sunday drive from Manhattan, the ladies
knew what it meant to celebrate. Oh my, yes. The dance bands showed
up at the Elk's or down the road at Scotty's nightclub, and the
ladies, so young then, so beautiful (not that they would tell you
themselves), cut the rug till dawn. So what if your fella has lead
feet or a bad back or all the natural rhythm of a lizard sunning
himself on a rock? Plenty of partners to go around back then;
plenty of good lookers to steal a dance.
</P>
<P>
   And wasn't that Lillian doing the Peabody with her childhood
sweetheart? Yes, indeed, true enough. But must we get into that?
Lillian says. Sixty years later, she won't breathe his name.
``Can't tell ya,'' she says, looking down. ``A secret.'' Still?
``Oh, yes, still.'' A fine thing, having a secret stored away when
you're 86.
</P>
<P>
   It's nice to meet the ladies, so pale and frail and beset by
ailments, husbands gone now, children busy elsewhere _ and still
they're excited about New Year's Eve. Of course, you won't catch
them going out with the rest of the crazies. You won't see them in
Times Square, waiting to watch the big ball drop. You won't hear of
them climbing Mount Everest, to dance at midnight with the sherpas.
Nor will you see them in London, peering through binoculars as the
queen lights the beacon and boats down the Thames.
</P>
<P>
   No. The ladies will be right here, their dainty, slippered feet
propped up in their sparkling white living room, cozy in their
little mobile home that is tucked away like a nice box of cookies
in a corner of Palm Beach County. Lillian will fix the cheese and
crackers. Kay will turn on the TV a bit before midnight, because
the big ball is Waterford crystal this year, and they don't want to
miss it coming down. And then they will clink water glasses or
coffee cups (isn't it unfortunate the doctor says no champagne?)
and quietly toast the New Year, just the two of them, together once
again.
</P>
<P>
   And thankful for it, too. Because they know what it is to be
apart. Their parents died when they were just girls, and the King
sisters got split up. Lillian and Anne went to aunts. Kay, the
oldest, moved into a home to help care for runaways. So now when
people say to the ladies, ``Oh you poor things! Alone at the turn
of the millennium!'' they say, ``Tsk. Not at all. Not at all. What
are you thinking? We're not alone, we're together.''
</P>
<P>
   And isn't that, after all, the point? Tends to get lost, doesn't
it, in the push and rush? All this fuss over a thousand years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kay,'' says Lillian, from her corner on the couch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, Lillian?''
</P>
<P>
   ``What was that story about a duck?''
</P>
<P>
   Duck? Duck? Oh dear, you put on the years, the memory goes. But
who cares, really, about details? It's the broad brush strokes, the
feeling of a thing, that counts. Not the date or time or place. The
great duck debacle, that was the 1920s or '30s, give or take a
decade. And _ here comes Lillian's memory, kicking in _ it was
Scotty's nightclub, wasn't it? Yes, definitely. Scotty's in West
Nyack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to dance till well after midnight,'' Lillian says.
``Then go down to the diner with the husbands and have breakfast,
and then go back home and roll into bed. Honest truth _ going to
bed at 5 a.m. Of course, that was before we had children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One New Year's Eve at Scotty's,'' Kay recalls, picking up the
thread, ``there was a door prize. And I was so absolutely thrilled,
because I won it!''
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected a nice bouquet of flowers,'' Lillian says.
``Something pretty like that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it wasn't flowers at all,'' Kay says. ``It was a duck.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A live duck,'' Lillian points out.
</P>
<P>
   Kay collected the door prize, jubilant but a bit confused _
because what, exactly, does one do with a duck? _ and brought the
poor thing home, where it encamped in the basement. The duck was
beautiful and white and here, pardon the ladies, the story turns a
bit grim. Because Kay's husband, Frank, a professional chef, crept
down to the basement and retrieved the duck and took him to the
butcher's and brought him home again and cooked him up on New
Year's Day and then everybody sat down to dinner and . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody could eat a bite,'' Lillian says. ``Not a single
bite.''
</P>
<P>
   Now here is a bit of a confession: Even though the ladies are
sorry about the duck, they are grateful to have the memory.
</P>
<P>
   Their husbands are gone. Frank, with his jokes. Gene, who never
had a bad word. And their sister, Anne, who passed on a few years
ago, from emphysema. And can you believe it? The same thing took
Kay's daughter, Jane. Their friends are gone, too _ and once they
had so many. ``Everyone knew us,'' Lillian says, a sliver of a
smile spreading. So it's the memories, in the end, that one relies
on.
</P>
<P>
   House parties. Club dancing. The next-door neighbor's coconut
cream pie. Spin the Bottle, and if you want to know whom they
kissed, keep asking. Hobbies. Knitting. Shuffleboard. Kay used to
drive a black Volkswagen: ``The Black Streak,'' everybody used to
say, ``just went by on the way to the store.'' Service club.
Bringing food to the poor. Lillian did the cooking. Kay brought
home a paycheck: She was a nurse for 40 years _ knew what it was to
be a working woman before the phrase was coined. And one more
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Who was it, Lillian, out there on the dance floor? Who is your
childhood sweetheart? Surely it won't hurt to give away a name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shhh,'' Lillian says, finger to her lips. ``Tell you next
year.''

 &HT;    Don't fight a navel battle, dads
 &HT;    By The Practical Man
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The practical man is embarrassed to
admit it, but last week he screwed up.
</P>
<P>
   Things fell apart when his 15-year-old daughter discovered her
belly, and pushed his buttons.
</P>
<P>
   Toting an algebra book, she took her newly bared midriff on a
stroll through the kitchen, where he sat locked in a mighty game of
chess with her little sister. Her plan was to butter him up by
asking for homework help, but by the time she mustered the courage
to croak ``Dad,'' the practical man wasn't listening anymore.
</P>
<P>
   He was gazing into her navel.
</P>
<P>
   And in that yawning chasm, he saw his future: Punks in pickups,
prom nights, a long walk down the aisle, and a rugrat slobbering on
his pant leg, squeaking ``Play, Grandpa, play!''
</P>
<P>
   Rattled, he went wrong. Instead of ignoring her tummy and
solving her problems and remaining a friend to his child, he
panicked _ and became her foe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Need money for shirts?''
</P>
<P>
   ``What?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Your belly.''
</P>
<P>
   Stung, she stopped, poked a foot out front and hitched her free
hand onto her hip. Their eyes met in a fiery embrace. The practical
man should have blinked, but no. The battle was on.
</P>
<P>
   She drew her weapon.
</P>
<P>
   It was one she's wielded since infancy, one that had pierced his
stony heart all too often, a doom-dealer that he secretly calls the
Sword of Scalding Tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sweet Jesus. What are you crying about?''
</P>
<P>
   ``What is wrong with my shirt?''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, now she'd picked up the Axe of Attitude, a murderous blade
that seldom missed its mark. The practical man was hurt, and he got
hateful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your gut is hanging out. You look like a sleaze.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the style, Dad. Everyone wears them this way. Why do you
have to be so stupid about everything?''
</P>
<P>
   The bloodbath boiled to its inevitable end. There was the Maul
of Watch Your Mouth and the Flail of Just Forget It. The Lance of
Listen to Me met the Shield of Shut Up, and the Club of Who Cares
broke a bone or two. Desperate, she swung the Hammer of I Hate You
and stormed off to her room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your move, Daddy,'' his baby daughter said. ``And DO NOT
checkmate me.''
</P>
<P>
   When he heard her voice, the practical man saw his folly. You
can't be a parent to a kid who won't speak to you. He plopped a
knight where her pawn could grab it and headed for his daughter's
door.
</P>
<P>
   How could he win her back? Flowers would have to do _ the Purple
Rose of Please Forgive Me and the Lilac of I Love You.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Practical Man: May we have your views on the importance of
color? As long as a wheel goes round, for instance, I don't give a
hoot what color it is. My wife, being a woman and therefore
inescapably non-practical, looks on color first, with all other
attributes being definitely low in importance. Furniture must first
be of the correct color. Comfort, wearability, and resistance to
stain are nice but not essential. What does the practical man say?
_ John
</P>
<P>
   Artificial coloring, cosmetics, decorations, appliques and the
like offend the practical man. These pretenders make a mockery of
beauty and make the practical man suspicious, for he knows that
anything of true value needs no paint _ unless of course that paint
is a good quality water seal, say, or has ``oleum'' in its name.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the practical man cares not about the color of clothing,
furniture, automobiles and other items whose usefulness does not
depend on appearance.
</P>
<P>
   At least he didn't used to care. But now that you've sicced his
brain on it, the practical man fears he could work himself into
quite a lather over the subject _ if he weren't careful.
</P>
<P>
   He might start, hypothetically of course, by pointing out that
it's mud-dwelling marketers and slimy salesmen who are behind most
color schemes.
</P>
<P>
   He'd probably continue by noting that these thieves pointlessly
dye, decorate and doctor up innumerable everyday objects such as
T-shirts, Geos and No. 2 pencils hoping to persuade pop-eyed
pea-brains to pay extra because they're pretty.
</P>
<P>
   And since he'd already gone this far, the practical man might
even press his analysis to its inescapable conclusion and assert
the searing truth that the world is full of absurdities such as
blue computers and pink soap because the world is full of shallow
people who buy cereal and pick lovers because of packaging.
</P>
<P>
   But the practical man would never really go this far, John, for
the practical man is deep. He's a superheavy practical man who's
got no patience for people who can't see past paint, and he knows
talking at length about something as superficial as color would
likely give him a case of the blues a case of Johnny Red couldn't
fix.

 &HT;    Harrick in Harmony: Coach commits to rebuilding Bulldogs
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS _ To read some accounts of his brief tenure at Georgia,
one imagines a befuddled and confused Jim Harrick, huddled behind a
locked door in his Stegeman Coliseum office, fighting back tears
and wailing, ``Why, Lord, why?''
</P>
<P>
   The real-life Harrick sits at his compulsively neat and tidy
desk, door wide open, people milling in and out, whistling as he
works through a huge stack of Christmas cards on his left. He signs
each, not pausing to see the recipient, then stacks them neater
still in a pile to his right. All the while, he chats away.
</P>
<P>
   Harrick knows what some people are saying about him. He read the
ESPN Magazine story that concluded he was a bitter has-been who
could never be happy anywhere but UCLA. He's gotten wind of rival
recruiters telling prospects, ``Harrick won't be at Georgia but a
year or two tops; just look how undecided he was taking the job in
the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   He's heard it all. And to it all, he laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thinks I'm a despondent, down and depressed guy,''
Harrick says, chuckling. ``That's bull. . . . I had a tough moment;
that's just part of life. But we've all recovered; we've gone on.
I'm enjoying myself. I've had as much fun . . . as I've had in my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   If Harrick ever had been forlorn, his spirits were lifted after
a drama-filled, three-game stretch against Furman, Georgia Tech and
Wake Forest. The Bulldogs won all three games, one in overtime and
two at the buzzer. The victories invigorated Georgia's fans and
players alike, and apparently Harrick as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Harrick probably wouldn't want me to say this, but I
think he's having more fun coaching right now than he ever has in
his life,'' Marshall coach Greg White said. White has known Harrick
since the middle '80s and was an assistant for him at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's grown to appreciate what he does for a living,'' White
said. ``I have noticed an unbelievable happiness in him because
he's back in the big time.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning helps. Although their 7-4 record hasn't earned the
Bulldogs national recognition or a Top 25 ranking, those closest to
the program realize what magic Harrick has worked to take them into
SEC play with a winning record.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia had lost five seniors and its leading scorer and
rebounder, Jumaine Jones, who bolted for the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   That the Bulldogs would win seven games before Christmas by
starting a pair of junior-college transfers and a walk-on _ with
their top recruit ineligible and their top two reserves sidelined
with injuries _ seemed unfathomable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you right now, there's not a better coach in college
basketball than Jim Harrick, and I don't care what anybody says,''
says White, whose undefeated Thundering Herd beat him 89-79 on Dec.
18. ``He can coach with anybody, anytime. He's beaten them all.
Georgia, they're fortunate to have Jim Harrick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll take him a couple of years. That's a big-time league
he's in; you've got to have some horses in the barn to compete
every night. And his barn is definitely not loaded right now. But
two years from right now, call me back and that stable will be
full. I've never seen a guy who's more energized in recruiting than
he was the last half of his career at UCLA.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just the winning that has Harrick heartened. It's
the attitude of the players. They've bought into his philosophy,
his system, his personality. They believe in Harrick, and
vice-versa.
</P>
<P>
   His players speak of him in reverent tones. Junior-college
transfer Anthony Evans says he considered it a ``sign from God''
when Georgia hired Harrick. And sophomore guard D.A. Layne, after
the Bulldogs' surprising victory over Wake Forest said, ``I'm just
glad God sent him to me, sent him to our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrick blushes at such comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are great young guys,'' Harrick says. ``They bust it;
they give it everything they've got. It's a joy to coach these
guys. I don't ever consider the record. I just want to look in the
mirror and see at the end of the year that we've done the very best
job with the talent that we have. That's all I live by.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrick admits that he had moments of acute doubt, even after he
started his new job. Sixty-one years old and the grandfather of
five, Harrick couldn't help but question why he made the move from
the competitive comfort of Rhode Island to rebuild Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   He knew the answers _ professional ego, competitive spirit,
money _ but they pulled directly against the other forces in his
life: family and peace of mind as he neared his retirement years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember many times in the spring saying to myself, `I don't
need this.' I'm on a plane to Chanute, Kan., I'm going out to
Scotts Bluff, Neb., recruiting a junior-college guy. And I'm
saying, `Wait. What am I doing?'
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've fallen back into my pace that I was before when I was
at UCLA, and I've quite enjoyed it.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the good Harrick knew he could do for Georgia, and
Georgia could do for his career, he also knew that he might damage
his family circle. At Rhode Island, Harrick had built a comfortable
nest for himself. It was a job at which he could be only moderately
successful but still flourish.
</P>
<P>
   After leading the Rams to back-to-back NCAA Tournaments,
including a trip to the Elite Eight, he was beloved by all. One of
his three sons was on his staff, and another had taken a job in
Providence and was building a house there so his children could be
close to their grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   After Harrick left for Georgia, his son, Jim Jr., was dismissed
at Rhode Island, and his close-knit family was scattered again.
That's why he vacillated on his commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep down, those were the things I was thinking about,'' he
says. ``I was torn between that and my family. I just got caught up
in an emotional thing. Any time your children are involved, it
becomes very emotional.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an ego; I think we all do. But I was torn because I had
been there. I was telling myself, I don't need to go back to
working 15-hour days, (all over the country) recruiting. I got home
at a quarter to 12 last night.''
</P>
<P>
   The ESPN Magazine article, written by Gene Wojciechowski,
focuses on Harrick's firing at UCLA, the recruiting controversy
that led to it and the anger Harrick continues to harbor about what
happened there. Although Wojciechowski is a longtime trusted
professional acquaintance, Harrick says he felt betrayed by the
article's tone. He says it exaggerated the negatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I bitter about leaving UCLA? Yes, I am, and I'll probably
take that to my grave,'' Harrick says. But, he adds, he's not
curled up in a corner cursing his fate.
</P>
<P>
   No, Harrick claims he is now very positive about his future. He
recently signed a four-year contract that will pay him nearly
$600,000 a year. He has lined up three of the state's top recruits
and speaks with excitement about next season's prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can be very happy at Georgia,'' he says. ``After
being here awhile, I realize the magnitude of the University of
Georgia, the magnitude of the Southeastern Conference, the ability
to compete at the highest level. . . . This is a place I could live
in for a long, long time. It's a terrific area, and my wife and I
have come to really like it and enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he says with a laugh, ``where am I gonna go?''

 &HT;    Time to tend your nest egg for annual checkup
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I spent most of last weekend tidying up my family's
financial files.
</P>
<P>
   I do this every so often, and I always run across things I've
forgotten, mislaid or fumbled.
</P>
<P>
   A year-end housecleaning is a good way to sort your records, and
it also helps you focus on your expectations for the coming year,
including money matters.
</P>
<P>
   There are any number of steps you can take to refresh your
understanding of your financial affairs. Many of them are baby
steps, but they still move you ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you're young and just starting out, middle-aged, or near
retirement, there's plenty of advice to help you get it together.
You might spot something useful in the suggestions for other age
groups, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some moves that can benefit people of any age:
</P>
<P>
   _ Record keeping. An accordion folder or a drawer full of manila
folders will help keep things sorted out. Keep separate folders for
investment statements, insurance paperwork, mortgage statements,
credit card bills, warranties and the like. Then you can see if
something is missing, and you can find anything when you need it.
</P>
<P>
   For a free booklet, ``Getting Financially Organized _ Money
Minder Worksheets,'' call Citibank at 1-800-669-2635.
</P>
<P>
   _ Credit cards. Assemble the latest statements and add up how
much you owe. If you can, estimate how much more you've added with
holiday purchases. The total may surprise you. At least it will
suggest how much you need to pay off each month to bring down the
debt. Don't forget, the interest penalties on credit card debt are
very high.
</P>
<P>
   _ Credit reports. You want to look for mistakes or derogatory
entries that you should challenge. Georgia residents are entitled
to two free reports a year from all three major credit bureaus.
Call these numbers: Equifax, 1-800-685-1111; Experian (formerly
called TRW), 1-888-397-3742; and TransUnion, 1-800-916-8800.
</P>
<P>
   _ Savings plans. One method is to authorize an automatic
deduction from your paycheck. You can shift the money into
investments later, or you can use it to pay big expenses, such as
insurance bills, vacations or next year's holiday spending. Add up
the expenses you want to cover and divide the total by the number
of paydays you have. That's the amount you should have deducted
from each paycheck. Believe me, it's easier if you never touch the
money.
</P>
<P>
   Another tactic is to set aside, right now, 10 percent of any
cash gifts you got over the holidays. Same thing with year-end
bonuses. When it comes to saving, the first step is always the
hardest.
</P>
<P>
   _ Privacy. To safeguard your identity, make it a practice to
shred or tear up any mail or documents with your Social Security
number or other personal information.
</P>
<P>
   _ Simplicity. Think of this process as a tune-up, not an
overhaul. You will have a better chance of success if you stick
with specific, manageable actions. Remember, baby steps.
</P>
<P>
   STARTING FRESH
</P>
<P>
   People in their 20s or young 30s, just getting their feet on the
ground, need to take care of the basics.
</P>
<P>
   _ Look ahead. Make a date with your spouse or partner to sit
down and agree on where you want to be five years from now. The
goals could include buying a house, paying off debts, starting a
family, any number of things.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have a plan, you can work backward, visualizing the
steps you will have to take to get to your goals.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cash reserve. It's wise to build an emergency fund, in case
you lose your job or become disabled. Financial planners suggest a
stash equal to at least three months of living expenses.
</P>
<P>
   _ Employee benefit plans. Your goal is to get the most you can
from whatever your employer offers. Group insurance plans, for
example, are usually cheaper than you can buy on your own. You may
have flexible savings plans that will save on taxes as you set
aside money for medical or child care expenses.
</P>
<P>
   If you have access to a 401(k) retirement plan, by all means
participate. You'll cut your income taxes. At least put in enough
to capture any matching contributions that the company offers.
That's free money.
</P>
<P>
   Check with the human resources or employee benefits office to
find out what your company offers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Invest now. Sure, the stock market is high now. Sure, you'll
make more money next year. Sure, you'll start socking it away then.
</P>
<P>
   Let's be honest: The hardest part about investing is making
yourself start. It's like getting engaged; once you make the
commitment, the rest gets easier.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for starting now is that the longer you leave an
investment alone, the faster its value will grow. That's what the
``magic of compounding'' is all about.
</P>
<P>
   Set aside something from your next paycheck, even if it's only
$10. Keep it up.
</P>
<P>
   _ Budgeting. The hard way is by figuring out how much you need
and feeling bad about how little is left. The more satisfying way
is by keeping track of how much you spend for, say, two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   What you will probably find is a lot of impulsive and
unrewarding spending. That gives you a place to start on
controlling your spending. It also gives you the outline of what
items are, in fact, essential _ things like rent, car payments and
utilities.
</P>
<P>
   MIDCOURSE CORRECTIONS
</P>
<P>
   When people turn 40, they start thinking about making the most
of their peak earning years _ and their retirement years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Strategies. Too many people stick with very conservative
investments, with the aim of avoiding any losses. Others have
gotten too aggressive, thinking that anybody can make money in a
hot stock market. Those are the extremes _ fear and greed.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in between is the right place for most investors. Now
is a good time to examine how much risk you're willing to take and
how big a reward you need from your investments. If you've already
done that, it won't hurt to review your plan and see if you've
still got the right balance.
</P>
<P>
   _ Investment performance. Year-end is a good time to see how
your investments have done. Compare each to a suitable benchmark _
for mutual funds, an index such as the S&AMP;P 500, or you can also
check it against funds with similar goals. You can usually find
that information at a public library, in Morningstar or other
research publications.
</P>
<P>
   For stocks, the best reference point might be how other stocks
in the same industry have performed. That's in Value Line, also
available at larger libraries.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the raw numbers, you can evaluate what those resources
have to say about future prospects of your holdings. If a stock
seems undervalued, you might want to buy more. If it's overpriced,
maybe you can sell and look for more promising opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   _ Asset allocation. Many investors have already decided what
percentage to keep in various types of investments, such as stocks,
bonds and money market accounts. The booming market may have
changed the mix significantly. If so, you can congratulate yourself
even as you decide whether to shift back to your chosen
allocations. This is painless in tax-deferred retirement accounts
like 401(k) plans, because you won't have to pay taxes on the
winners you sell.
</P>
<P>
   _ Expert help. Everybody needs help with complicated topics, and
most people need hand-holding. That's why the world has so many
pastors, psychiatrists and bartenders. In your year-end review,
consider whether a financial planner could help figure out what to
do next or just help you look for flaws in your own plan. For
guidance in picking a professional, call the Certified Financial
Planner Board of Standards at 1-888-237-6275 and ask for a free
copy of the booklet, ``10 Questions to Ask When Choosing a
Financial Planner.'' You can find it on the Internet at
www.cfp-board.org.

<P>
   _ Insurance. This is a complicated and often stressful subject.
I recommend reading ``Smarter Insurance Solutions,'' a first-class,
brief and easy-to-understand guide for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Your will. A high percentage of Americans haven't gotten
around to writing a will, not to mention a living will or powers of
attorney. If you're in that batch, call an attorney for an
appointment to do it. You could save your heirs from nasty fights
and unnecessary tax bills.

   As careers end, older workers begin organizing for leisure

retirement community _ when you first retire._ Retirement income.

 &HT;    Time to tend your nest egg for annual checkup
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I spent most of last weekend tidying up my family's
financial files.
</P>
<P>
   I do this every so often, and I always run across things I've
forgotten, mislaid or fumbled.
</P>
<P>
   A year-end housecleaning is a good way to sort your records, and
it also helps you focus on your expectations for the coming year,
including money matters.
</P>
<P>
   There are any number of steps you can take to refresh your
understanding of your financial affairs. Many of them are baby
steps, but they still move you ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you're young and just starting out, middle-aged, or near
retirement, there's plenty of advice to help you get it together.
You might spot something useful in the suggestions for other age
groups, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some moves that can benefit people of any age:
</P>
<P>
   _ Record keeping. An accordion folder or a drawer full of manila
folders will help keep things sorted out. Keep separate folders for
investment statements, insurance paperwork, mortgage statements,
credit card bills, warranties and the like. Then you can see if
something is missing, and you can find anything when you need it.
</P>
<P>
   For a free booklet, ``Getting Financially Organized _ Money
Minder Worksheets,'' call Citibank at 1-800-669-2635.
</P>
<P>
   _ Credit cards. Assemble the latest statements and add up how
much you owe. If you can, estimate how much more you've added with
holiday purchases. The total may surprise you. At least it will
suggest how much you need to pay off each month to bring down the
debt. Don't forget, the interest penalties on credit card debt are
very high.
</P>
<P>
   _ Credit reports. You want to look for mistakes or derogatory
entries that you should challenge. Georgia residents are entitled
to two free reports a year from all three major credit bureaus.
Call these numbers: Equifax, 1-800-685-1111; Experian (formerly
called TRW), 1-888-397-3742; and TransUnion, 1-800-916-8800.
</P>
<P>
   _ Savings plans. One method is to authorize an automatic
deduction from your paycheck. You can shift the money into
investments later, or you can use it to pay big expenses, such as
insurance bills, vacations or next year's holiday spending. Add up
the expenses you want to cover and divide the total by the number
of paydays you have. That's the amount you should have deducted
from each paycheck. Believe me, it's easier if you never touch the
money.
</P>
<P>
   Another tactic is to set aside, right now, 10 percent of any
cash gifts you got over the holidays. Same thing with year-end
bonuses. When it comes to saving, the first step is always the
hardest.
</P>
<P>
   _ Privacy. To safeguard your identity, make it a practice to
shred or tear up any mail or documents with your Social Security
number or other personal information.
</P>
<P>
   _ Simplicity. Think of this process as a tune-up, not an
overhaul. You will have a better chance of success if you stick
with specific, manageable actions. Remember, baby steps.
</P>
<P>
   STARTING FRESH
</P>
<P>
   People in their 20s or young 30s, just getting their feet on the
ground, need to take care of the basics.
</P>
<P>
   _ Look ahead. Make a date with your spouse or partner to sit
down and agree on where you want to be five years from now. The
goals could include buying a house, paying off debts, starting a
family, any number of things.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have a plan, you can work backward, visualizing the
steps you will have to take to get to your goals.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cash reserve. It's wise to build an emergency fund, in case
you lose your job or become disabled. Financial planners suggest a
stash equal to at least three months of living expenses.
</P>
<P>
   _ Employee benefit plans. Your goal is to get the most you can
from whatever your employer offers. Group insurance plans, for
example, are usually cheaper than you can buy on your own. You may
have flexible savings plans that will save on taxes as you set
aside money for medical or child care expenses.
</P>
<P>
   If you have access to a 401(k) retirement plan, by all means
participate. You'll cut your income taxes. At least put in enough
to capture any matching contributions that the company offers.
That's free money.
</P>
<P>
   Check with the human resources or employee benefits office to
find out what your company offers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Invest now. Sure, the stock market is high now. Sure, you'll
make more money next year. Sure, you'll start socking it away then.
</P>
<P>
   Let's be honest: The hardest part about investing is making
yourself start. It's like getting engaged; once you make the
commitment, the rest gets easier.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for starting now is that the longer you leave an
investment alone, the faster its value will grow. That's what the
``magic of compounding'' is all about.
</P>
<P>
   Set aside something from your next paycheck, even if it's only
$10. Keep it up.
</P>
<P>
   _ Budgeting. The hard way is by figuring out how much you need
and feeling bad about how little is left. The more satisfying way
is by keeping track of how much you spend for, say, two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   What you will probably find is a lot of impulsive and
unrewarding spending. That gives you a place to start on
controlling your spending. It also gives you the outline of what
items are, in fact, essential _ things like rent, car payments and
utilities.
</P>
<P>
   MIDCOURSE CORRECTIONS
</P>
<P>
   When people turn 40, they start thinking about making the most
of their peak earning years _ and their retirement years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Strategies. Too many people stick with very conservative
investments, with the aim of avoiding any losses. Others have
gotten too aggressive, thinking that anybody can make money in a
hot stock market. Those are the extremes _ fear and greed.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in between is the right place for most investors. Now
is a good time to examine how much risk you're willing to take and
how big a reward you need from your investments. If you've already
done that, it won't hurt to review your plan and see if you've
still got the right balance.
</P>
<P>
   _ Investment performance. Year-end is a good time to see how
your investments have done. Compare each to a suitable benchmark _
for mutual funds, an index such as the S&AMP;P 500, or you can also
check it against funds with similar goals. You can usually find
that information at a public library, in Morningstar or other
research publications.
</P>
<P>
   For stocks, the best reference point might be how other stocks
in the same industry have performed. That's in Value Line, also
available at larger libraries.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the raw numbers, you can evaluate what those resources
have to say about future prospects of your holdings. If a stock
seems undervalued, you might want to buy more. If it's overpriced,
maybe ou can sell and look for more promising opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   _ Asset allocation. Many investors have already decided what
percentage to keep in various types of investments, such as stocks,
bonds and money market accounts. The booming market may have
changed the mix significantly. If so, you can congratulate yourself
even as you decide whether to shift back to your chosen
allocations. This is painless in tax-deferred retirement accounts
like 401(k) plans, because you won't have to pay taxes on the
winners you sell.
</P>
<P>
   _ Expert help. Everybody needs help with complicated topics, and
most people need hand-holding. That's why the world has so many
pastors, psychiatrists and bartenders. In your year-end review,
consider whether a financial planner could help figure out what to
do next or just help you look for flaws in your own plan. For

Planner Board of Standards at 1-888-237-6275 and ask for a free

 &HT;    My fellow Americans, I give you...me
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ ``My name is Elizabeth Schuett and I'm
running for President because I want to live in a really big house
that I don't have to dust. I'd also enjoy having someone to cook
and take care of the cat's sandbox (preferably not the same
person).
</P>
<P>
   ``And by the way, I haven't used cocaine since 1934.''
</P>
<P>
   What I'm doing here is called disclosure; it's what
state-of-the-art politicians do nowadays. It's kind of like a
preventive revelation where I immediately own up to a bunch of
little stuff before the opposition has a chance to dig up any big
stuff and accuse me of trying to cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   My political advisors (the retired guys I drink coffee with
every morning at the cafe) have informed me that if I intend to be
a winner in 2000, I have to confess right now to every sorry thing
I've ever done. I suggest they remove that glint from their beady
eyes but they insist James Carville would give me the same advice
only it'd cost me some big bucks whereas they work for just coffee
and maybe a doughnut.
</P>
<P>
   Current events have, of course, proven my wily consorts correct
and since I really want this job (great medical and retirement),
here goes: ``My fellow Americans, you're looking at an imperfect
woman but I want you to rest assured that what you see is what
you're going to get. True, I have in the past been guilty of
ripping the Do Not Remove Under Penalty of Law tags off my throw
pillows, but those days are behind me and I have been in recovery
for 27 years. That's right folks, not a single rip since '72. But
there's more.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1939, I played hooky from kindergarten and went to Tootie's
house (it was her mom's baking day) but I paid for the crime.
Justice was swift and brutal. My mother dragged me back to school
and the teacher made me sit in a corner while the other kids had
snacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1940, I sneaked the neighbor's dog into my bedroom to spend
the night. Skippy wet the bed and I lied and said I'd done it so
they'd let him come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``That same year I kissed Dean Braxton. He squealed to the
teacher and I served hard time behind the clothes shutters.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1942, I sabotaged the war effort by giving our flattened
tin cans to the kid next door in exchange for his Jack Armstrong
flashlight so I could read Wonder Woman comic books under the
covers. My mother accused me of abetting the enemy. She was sure
our neighbors were Axis spies because of the suspicious way they
turned out their lights during air raid drills.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1946, Bettye Harris and I charged the neighborhood kids a
dime apiece to come in the backyard and watch her father dig out
the septic tank. We had no businesss license but worse than that,
we spent the 30-cents we made on a True Romance magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1952, I changed the birth date on my Florida driver's
license and made myself three years older so I could go dancing
with my friends in Miami Beach nightclubs. Forty years later, when
I really needed those three years back, Ohio gave me a hard time
about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1973, I saw 'The Way We Were' and lusted in my heart for
Robert Redford.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1996, I saw 'Up Close and Personal' _ and did it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``So there you have it; I've been guilty of it all - lust,
greed, deceit, and kissing Dean Braxton. And about the cocaine
thing _ I made that up just to be cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not an ex-basketball player (5 feet 3 before shrinkage),
and I've never built a skyscraper or hung out with the governor of
Minnesota. My father was never President (although he was real
proud to have shaken Ike's hand once), and I confess to barely
understanding the Internet much less suggesting I invented it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But folks, if you'll just keep my list of iniquities in mind
come election day, I give you my word as a politician-type-person,
I'll get out there and sin with the best of them, again...and
again...and again. I want to be a candidate you can be proud of.''

   MONEYTALK _ ATLANTA _ I spent most of last weekend tidying up my

run across things I've forgotten, mislaid or fumbled. A year-end
housecleaning is a good way to sort your records, and it also helps
you focus on your expectations for the coming year, including money
matters. This is a guide for all age groups. (Ezell, Atlanta

Atlanta _ to give their thumbs up or thumbs down to five things to
look for in 2000. Their ``ins'' and ``outs'' ranged from materials
(brushed metals are hot; shiny polished ones are not) to rooms
(offices and functional spaces got the nod; formal living rooms and
``decorator looks,'' the shaft) to design influences (Zen is in;
feng shui, a has been). (Flanders, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   TRAVEL-BIG-THICKET (Big Thicket National Preserve, Texas) _ The
Big Thicket is 86,000 acres of forest, meadow and swamp scattered
across 12 parcels of land and water just north of Beaumont. It's
wilderness incarnate. No camper hook-ups. No snack bars. No
plexiglass shields separating man from beast. Just you and the
elements. It's not your stereotypical tourist attraction, but the
65,000 or so people who visit each year find an enveloping solitude
and a biological diversity unmatched in North America. By JEANNIE
KEAVER. (Photo available on NYT database.)
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-BRAZOSPORT (Brazosport, Texas) _ Brazosport isn't
actually a city, something that has befuddled newcomers forever.
It's more a step back in time, a collection of nine towns
scattershot along the Brazos River as it rushes into the Gulf of
Mexico. It's a region where chemical plants battle with the beaches
for the area's identity. But close your eyes to the acres of
factories, steam and smoke belching from the labyrinthine pipes and
you'll find many simple pleasures. By JEANNIE KEAVER.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-WASHINGTON-COUNTY (Chappell Hill, Texas) _ From the
Texana Cigar &AMP; Coffee Co. in courtly Chappell Hill, to the Antique
Rose Emporium in Independence and the Blue Bell creamery in
Brenham, Washington County offers a taste of the Texas Hill
Country, free of the overdressed charm of the better-known towns
further west. Visitors savor the wildflowers and learn to
appreicate the region's pivotal role in Texas history. By JEANNIE
KEAVER. (Photo available on NYT database.)
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-HUNTSVILLE (Huntsville, Texas) _ Huntsville is
inextricably linked in the public mind with crime and punishment,
the location of the state's highest concentration of prisons and
the setting for its omnivorous appetite for executions. Tourism
promoters don't ignore that _ they happily provide directions to
all eight area prisons and hand out detailed maps of ``The Walls,''
the state's oldest prison, located just a few blocks from the town
square. But visitors here also discover a stark contrast in the
homespun entertainments of Huntsville State Park and Sam Houston
National Forest. By JEANNIE KEAVER. (Photo available on NYT

A CENTURY'S TOP STORIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; What were the top dozen business stories of the 20th century?
It's a game anyone can play. Here's my list. What's yours?
</P>
<P>
   _Dupont/GM. John J. Raskob stopped by General Motors on his
honeymoon in 1914 and bought 50 shares. Four years later he
persuaded his boss, Pierre S. Dupont, to buy control of the company
for $25 million. That put GM firmly on its feet and established
Dupont as the model of a diversified manufacturing corporation with
autonomous divisions and a centralized general office.
</P>
<P>
   _Ford/Sloan. Henry Ford was a manufacturing genius who developed
the affordable car and the $5 day. Alfred P. Sloan Jr. of GM swept
past him in the late 1920s by offering ``a car for every taste and
pocketbook,'' plus the comfort of closed bodies, the convenience of
installment financing and the excitement of annual model changes.
</P>
<P>
   _Sears/Wards. When World War II ended, Sears Roebuck &AMP; Co. and
Montgomery Ward &AMP; Co. were roughly on a par with one another: mail
order houses that had built an extensive network of retail stores
during the 1930s to serve the cities. But Ward feared post-war
depression and sat on its horde of cash. Sears expanded
aggressively, as did newcomers Woolworth, W.T. Grant and Kresge.
``Monkey'' Ward never recovered from its caution.
</P>
<P>
   _General Electric and strategic planning. Thomas Edison's
company was among the first to establish an industrial research
laboratory; by the 1890s it was manufacturing lightbulbs all over
the world. In the 1950s it intensified its strategy of
diversification, moving beyond turbines, locomotives and X-ray
machines into jet engines, appliances and synthetic diamonds. Its
strategic planning department was the best in the world; its labor
relations department the most inventive: its spokesman was a
Hollywood actor named Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   _McDonalds. Branding was a relatively little understood concept
when Ray Kroc used the capital he had accumulated selling paper
cups and milkshake machines to buy out the McDonald Brothers in
1954. Over the next 50 years, he followed the example of Coca-Cola
and Pepsi to show that just about anything could be mass-marketed.
</P>
<P>
   _Justice Department sues IBM. Little-noticed when the antitrust
division sued IBM on the last day of the Johnson Administration in
1969 was the fact that IBM unbundled its software in trepidation
only a month before. Fourteen years later the government folded its
hand, but only after a powerful independent software industry had
grown up under its mostly unwitting protection _ including a little
firm called Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   _Penn Central bankruptcy. It was one thing when the Great
Atlantic and Pacific Tea Co. went broke in the 1970 recession. But
the nation's premier railroad? The government's willingness to let
fail the merger of the Pennyslvania Railroad and the New York
Central signaled new limits to bailout policy.
</P>
<P>
   _Volunteer Army/reserve clause. Whether it was Curt Flood
breaking baseball's reserve clause in the courts _ a device to
control players' salaries by restraining bidding _ or the
recommendation by a panel of experts that soldiers be paid
competitive wages instead of drafted, markets in the early 1970s
dissolved old conceptions of teamwork.
</P>
<P>
   _MayDay and Reg Q. The end of fixed brokerage commissions in
1975 marked the beginning of deregulation in the United States. The
end of interest rate ceilings on bank deposits a few years later
accelerated the far-reaching transformation by which mutual funds
replaced banks as repositories of savings.
</P>
<P>
   _Toyota et al. The avalanche of Japanese high-quality automotive
imports that commenced in the mid-1970s taught a generation what
globalization was all about, and stimulated a higher degree of
competitiveness from virtually all American industry.
</P>
<P>
   _Milken. Michael Milken changed the rules of corporate
governance in the early 1980s, backing greenmail artists and
corporate builders alike with his junk bonds. His discovery of the
possibilities of the savings and loan industry did him in.
</P>
<P>
   _AT&AMP;T breakup. Antitrust chief William Baxter knocked the world
on its ear on Jan. 8, 1982, when he said never mind IBM Corp. and
negotiated the breakup of the Bell Telephone system instead. Nearly
20 years later, with the world embroiled in a telecommunications
revolution, it looks as though his theory of the case was correct.

 By IRENE SEGE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ At 6:50 a.m. on the second Tuesday of the last month of
the last year of the 20th century, Carol Gilligan leaves her
Brookline apartment, unshowered, her long hair uncombed, her decaf
cappuccino from Starbucks not yet purchased, to give her son's
fiance a ride to work.
</P>
<P>
   Thus starts a day in the life of the Harvard psychologist whose
groundbreaking 1982 book, ``In a Different Voice,'' detailed the
exclusion of women from traditional psychological theory. Think
about women's ``voices'' and girls' ``voices'' and chances are
you're thinking about Gilligan's work. Criticize the notion that
society doesn't listen to female voices and, well, you're thinking
about Gilligan, too. List women who influenced modern feminism and
Gilligan's name will come up.
</P>
<P>
   In a day that begins with her taking Golbarg Niknejad to her job
as a surgical resident at Brigham &AMP; Women's Hospital and ends with
her boarding an airplane with Shakespeare &AMP; Company founder Tina
Packer, Gilligan, 63, reflects on the status of women as one
century gives way to the next. So do women whose lives intersect
with hers (or whose lives cross those whose lives cross hers)
between this particular dawn and dusk.
</P>
<P>
   Call it one degree of separation (or two) from Carol Gilligan.
Or, better yet, call it listening to Gilligan and the voices around
her. As hopeful as women are after a century of remarkable change,
they're still unsettled in their new roles.
</P>
<P>
   The century began with women barred from voting and ends,
Gilligan notes, with ``the fact that in the last two elections
women elected the president.'' It began with women comprising 4
percent of medical students and less than 1 percent of lawyers and
ends with women occupying 44 percent of the seats in the nation's
medical schools and 46 percent of seats in law schools. It began
with the average American woman giving birth to three or four
children, and ends with her having two. It ends, too, with almost a
quarter of American women living in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't seem possible at the end of the century to do what
was done for most of the millennium, which was to talk about humans
without having women in your consciousness,'' Gilligan says. ``It
seems a very hopeful moment to me. But hope is a dangerous emotion
because you're very vulnerable if you're in a place of hope. So
it's a very volatile moment, too.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is as mother of three sons and future mother-in-law that
Gilligan drives Niknejad, 30, to work this rainy morning from the
apartment they share with Gilligan's husband, James, and youngest
child (Niknejad's fiance), 33-year-old Christopher.
</P>
<P>
   Niknejad is Iranian born, daughter of a homemaker and an air
force colonel. In 1983, when she was 16, the family fled a Muslim
theocracy that did not let women show their hair in public or wear
lipstick or, as Niknejad says, ``express yourself at all'' or
``change the world in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   When they arrived in San Diego with virtually all their money
still in Iran, her father worked days as a dispatcher and nights as
a baker, her mother worked in restaurants, and she found a job in a
pizza parlor. Now Niknejad is a resident in urological surgery at a
time when only 11 percent of urology residents are female.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just being able to take the kerchief off your head was a very
strange experience. Sometimes I cry because I'm so happy to have
these opportunities and be here,'' Niknejad says. ``But I sometimes
see how much women struggle with this type of freedom. Are women in
Iran happier than women here? You wonder if we have the freedom we
think we do. We have so many limitations compared to men. We
struggle in this role of trying to do everything.''
</P>
<P>
   An hour after she takes Niknejad to work, Gilligan leaves home
again. Her hair is wet from her morning shower when she steps into
an elevator already occupied by Cecilia Ryden and her 12-year-old
daughter Kristina, here from Sweden where 75 percent of women work
outside the home, compared with 60 percent in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm grown up I want to be an actress,'' says Kristina.
``I don't think I want a family because I think it should be hard
and you couldn't do so much things. I maybe couldn't work so much.
I couldn't go where I want to.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's not yet 9 o'clock when Gilligan walks into her office at
the Harvard Graduate School of Education, cappuccino in hand.
</P>
<P>
   What secured her place in the intellectual firmament stems from
a historical serendipity back in 1973 when she was working with
Lawrence Kohlberg, known for his theory of moral development. To
see how people make real choices, rather than resolve hypothetical
dilemmas, she began to study male Harvard students facing the
draft. What did they say as sophomores? What would they do as
seniors facing conscription? Then, on Jan. 27, 1973, President
Nixon ended the draft. Five days earlier the US Supreme Court had
legalized abortion, so Gilligan switched to study women deciding
whether to continue or terminate pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   When the answers women gave did not match psychological theory,
Gilligan noticed what she had failed to notice a decade earlier
when, without question, she devised her doctoral research using an
all-male sample. The great psychological theories _ and the
emininent theorists with whom she studied, Kohlberg and Erik
Erikson _ described human development based on research with men
and boys. Women, quite simply, were absent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a shared cultural blindness that was so pervasive
that no one was seeing,'' she says. ``How could you leave out
women? You live with them. It's your mother. It's your daughter.
Who else have we left out? Oh my god, we've left out people of
color. We left out anyone who wasn't European, and we left out gays
and lesbians, and we left out the poor. It was suddenly seen that
the seemingly objective norm was not objective at all, but part of
a cultural fabric called patriarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the couch in Gilligan's office is a picture of the Virgin
Mary, whose pregnancy launched the first millennium. ``I think it's
possible that the new millennium will witness the end of
patriarchy,'' Gilligan says, citing everything from changing family
structure to the United Nations Conference on Women in Beijing in
1995. ``What we're living through is this sense of the coming apart
of patriarchy, for which there's obviously a very strong
countermovement to reinstate it. I'm not saying that won't triumph.
But we might score a learning point that patriarchy is not another
name for civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the hall outside Gilligan's office, her assistant,
Tatiana Bertsch, 26, gives graduate student Regina Feltman, 37, a
photographic tour of her hairdo history because Feltman is writing
a paper on women and their hair. Bertsch's story, told three
decades after the birth in Greenwich Village of the gay rights
movement, is as much a treatise on the fluidity of gender as it is
about hair.
</P>
<P>
   Here I am in high school, Bertsch is saying, when I was into
punk rock and keeping my hair short and dying it _ blue, green,
red, white _ every week or two. ``The whole punk rock idea,'' she
says, ``that you can invent yourself, do it yourself, create
yourself is something I found really liberating.''
</P>
<P>
   In college, Bertsch came out as a lesbian and grew her hair and
quit dying it so she wouldn't look stereotypically gay. ``I came
out at a time that I could come out,'' she says. ``But if this is
as good as it gets I don't think it speaks well for many of us.''
Then she fell in love with a woman who began taking testosterone to
become a man. Back came the short hair (``I didn't want to look
like a straight girl''). Now they've split, after three years
together, and Bertsch is growing her hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still confused,'' Bertsch says. ``This is in the
post-modern category. Am I attracted to a woman? Is a woman who's
on testosterone no longer a woman? If I'm in love with a person and
the actual gender doesn't matter how can I align myself as gay or
straight? Part of what's assumed is there are two categories of sex
and gender. I know it to not exactly be that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Feltman, meanwhile, is on her own journey. She's the New
Jersey-bred daughter of a pipefitter and a factory worker, the
physical education graduate who in 1986, devastated by the break-up
of her engagement, loaded up her Ford Tempo and drove west to San
Francisco. She's the business consultant who cultivated windsurfing
under the Golden Gate Bridge as much as her career, who, when she
had the chance, didn't hesitate to take a job in Paris. ``My mother
played the cards she was dealt as best she could,'' she says. ``I
don't think it ever crossed her mind to put the cards down and ask
for new ones or to refuse to play or to pick the card table up and
throw it across the room.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Feltman contemplates a future in which changing fields and
having a baby with or without a husband all seem possible.

YOU, TOO, CAN BE A HOT COMMODITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN LEVINGSTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the new millennium dawns, I have a single word of advice:
commodify.
</P>
<P>
   How the word dances trippingly off the tongue! Commodify! How
melodious is the ring of wisdom!
</P>
<P>
   In the 21st century, as the free market sweeps the globe, the
race to turn everything into a product for sale will only
intensify. It is time to assess your true value and tally up your
potential as a human product _ to be sold off either in parts or as
a complete entity. Already, art, literature, education, health
care, and most forms of sincerity are packaged and sold like
cereal.
</P>
<P>
   To spruce yourself up a bit and create a demand for your soul
does not take much of a leap. Ask Martha Stewart _ once a human,
now an on-line commodity, all in the blink of her bloodless eye.
</P>
<P>
   There is no subtle way to express it: Hurry, hurry, make a
product of yourself. Become a human brand.
</P>
<P>
   Take your cue from Dr. C. Everett Koop, once the flesh-and-blood
surgeon general of the United States, now an item of medical
merchandise on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Your name, your face, your hopes, your thoughts, your very being
_ they are all for sale, if you're smart.
</P>
<P>
   Former heavyweight champion George Foreman knows. In a knockout
deal signed this month, he agreed to sell his name and likeness for
all eternity to the housewares company Salton Inc. for $137.5
million. Under terms of the contract, the former boxer will
transform his being into the George Foreman Grill.
</P>
<P>
   The commodification of the self is good for you personally. It
is a healthy blending of the human and the economic. It will make
you wealthy and, therefore, happy. It is, after all, the direction
in which we have all been traveling for a long time. Selling
yourself like a box of macaroni and cheese is the next, glorious
step in the development of humankind.
</P>
<P>
   To commodify yourself is also a blessing for society. It is a
wholesome act that keeps the free market humming. But it is not to
be tackled lightly. If you want to be a commodity, you must undergo
a profound change in character for the better. You must see the
world through new, marketized eyes. You must renounce all archaic
notions of civility and public good will. Social considerations
conspire against your free-market being and have no place in the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
   In the new millennium, I intend to dedicate myself to the
economy at large as a human commodity. And so I will perform no
deed merely from the goodness of my heart. It is far better for me
and for our smoothly whirring economy if I am paid for every act of
public charity. If you fall on the street in front of me, I will by
necessity have to charge a small fee to help you up.
</P>
<P>
   In this fine spirit, I have so much of myself to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Need an organ? I know demand is great, and I do have a few to
spare. On the black market, I'm confident the price will be right.
</P>
<P>
   How about my friendship? Now there's a special part of myself
that only I can sell. If you'd like to be pals, I'm afraid it will
cost you whatever the market will bear.
</P>
<P>
   I am, by the way, an exceedingly happy fellow, and for a
reasonable, agreed-upon price I will sell you a piece of my
happiness.
</P>
<P>
   And then I have my words to sell. Impossible as it is to
believe, this newspaper actually pays me for them.

BRITAIN'S MILLENNIUM DOME: TO BE, OR NOT TO BE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ It looks like a huge circus tent turned upside down,
and there have been more than a few acrobatic acts associated with
it, but the Millennium Dome will be ready New Year's Eve, its
critics be damned.
</P>
<P>
   The focal point of Britain's millennium celebrations, the Dome
has cost roughly $1.2 billion _ or the same amount that was
considered too expensive by the British government when it rejected
a rail safety system that could have saved the lives of 31 people
killed in a train crash in west London in October.
</P>
<P>
   The Dome is being both lauded and loathed, breathlessly extolled
as an idol befitting a new, confident Cool Britannia, dismissed as
an extravagance by a government that believes image is everything.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike so much of Britain's image, which is reserved and full of
history and dead monarchs, the Dome is 20 acres of brash modernity
meant to celebrate British innovation. It will be opened New Year's
Eve by a very much alive monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, before a
handpicked audience of 12,000. When it opens to the public, the
Dome will accommodate up to 35,000 people at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Its fiberglass roof, held up by 12 yellow masts that stretch
nearly 300 feet into the air and have become a familiar landmark on
London's skyline, is the largest in the world. Something like a
cross between the Museum of Science and Barnum &AMP; Bailey, the Dome
has 14 interactive exhibition zones, with such themes as body,
faith, learning, work, money, and play, each of them conceived by
one of Britain's leading designers. There will also be a live
multimedia show with aerial acrobats performing 150 feet above the
floor in the central arena, which can hold 12,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The Millenium Dome, which sits on the banks of the River Thames
in Greenwich, will be open for just a year. More than 1 million
tickets have already been sold. Its promoters expect to attract
some 12 million visitors, more than 2 million of whom are expected
to be from overseas. It is not known what it will become after next
year, something that critics point to as evidence of cavalier
planning.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that the Dome has been built at all, on budget, and
on time, and without tax funds, is cited by Prime Minister Tony
Blair as proof that there is something great about Great Britain
again. (More than half the cost was paid by proceeds from the
national lottery, with the rest from corporate sponsors and ticket
sales.) For a country that has seen its once-great global empire
shrink this century to a smattering of inconsequential islands, the
Dome is a giant post-imperial pick-me-up.
</P>
<P>
   It has already cemented its place in popular culture, featuring
in the opening sequence of the latest James Bond movie, ``The World
is Not Enough,'' in which Agent 007 plummets onto the Dome's roof _
which, incidentally, was woven by a New Hampshire firm, Chemfab.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as he surveyed the Dome, Blair hailed it as ``a
triumph of confidence over cynicism, boldness over blandness,
excellence over mediocrity.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is impressed. In his new book about the Dome,
``Regeneration,'' Adam Nicolson recalls that when French President
Jacques Chirac was shown a model of the Dome last year he asked
what it was for.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's for a nation's confidence,'' one of the Dome's myriad
public relations specialists told him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chirac harrumphed and turned on his heel,'' Nicolson said.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of the exhibitions, its promoters say, is to answer
three questions: Who are we, where do we live, and what do we do?
The Dome's defenders say its exhibitions reflect a multicultural,
multiracial Britain that is not represented by its most famous
institutions and tourist attractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most every place you go tells you what the UK used to be. The
Dome experience is about where the UK is now, and to celebrate
where we're going,'' said Adam Liversage, one of the two dozen
twentysomething guides hired to explain to the press and the public
what the Dome is. ``People know about Shakespeare and Queen
Victoria. But that's not what Britain is today, and it's not where
we're going in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Liversage believes the Dome marks a sea change in British
attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a very British thing to do,'' he said, standing on
the Dome's floor, turning his tilted head from one shoulder to the
other to survey the massive roof. ``We spend a lot of time
criticizing, but we're not big for grand gestures. For once, we're
thinking big.''
</P>
<P>
   How big? Glad you asked, says Liversage. It's twice the size of
the Georgia Dome, where Atlanta's baseball and football teams play,
and which used to be the biggest. If you turned the Dome upside
down under Niagara Falls, it would take more than 10 minutes to
fill up. It is three times larger than the Colosseum in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   The developers invited some heavy-hitters to see if anyone could
drive a golf ball across the 360-yard diameter. No one could. It is
the third biggest indoor building in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Boeing building near Seattle is bigger, and so is the
vehicle assembly building at the Kennedy Space Center, which has
its own weather. We have better ventilation,'' said Liversage.
</P>
<P>
   The Dome's roof is covered with Teflon, and its defenders have
had to figuratively don a similar coat of armor to deflect
persistent criticism that the money for the project could have been
better spent elsewhere. Besides a rail safety system that was
exposed recently as one of the least innovative in Europe,
Britain's nationalized hospitals are bursting at the seams, as are
its elementary schools, where 40 children in a class is common.
</P>
<P>
   The British Tourist Authority estimates that the Dome could pump
more than $1 billion into the economy in just a year.
</P>
<P>
   And whatever becomes of the Dome, it has already done much to
rejuvenate the Greenwich Peninsula, which was once London's largest
abandoned and polluted riverside areas. Improvements to the local
infrastructure have driven up property values in the area, where
1,400 homes are to be built.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Laker of London's subway system, says the 10-mile Jubilee
Line extension from central London to the Dome is as remarkable an
engineering feat as the Dome itself. It is the first tunnel built
in the silt of southeast London.
</P>
<P>
   The six new stations on the extension have see-through barriers
that prevent anyone from falling or jumping in front of a train.
There are at least one and usually two suicides a week on the
Underground.
</P>
<P>
   The Dome was an idea originated under the Conservative
government of John Major. But when the Tories were unceremoniously
dumped in the Labor Party's landslide victory in May 1997, Blair
picked up the idea and never looked back. His government has
devoted much energy to ``rebranding'' Britain, deemphasizing its
imperial past and marketing a Britain that is young, hip, and
on-line.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Dome's persistent critics, who call it a waste of
money and not nearly as visionary as its press releases insist,
Blair said they ``despise anything modern.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Britain's notoriously fickle press was universally
hostile, viewing the idea as a boondoggle. It is rare that The Sun,
a tabloid which runs photos of bare-chested women on its pages, and
the Financial Times, the serious broadsheet voice of the business
community, agree on anything, but they agreed that the Dome would
be a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Dome has gradually risen on the horizon of southeast
London, it has gained fans. While trashing it used to be a favorite
British pasttime, defending it has become equally fashionable. The
Sun became one of its corporate sponsors and now lavishes praise on
a project it once denounced.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many who got a sneak preview of the Dome last week came
away underwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun, freaky, but not fantastic,'' The Guardian newspaper
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Chris and Julie Willford brought their three young sons for a
tour. Prepared to dislike it after all the hype, they came away
impressed by the use of technology and imagination. And the kids
loved it.
</P>
<P>
   But for every fan, there is a cynic. The Beatles song, ``All You
Need Is Love,'' has been chosen as the tune to inaugurate the Dome.
Dome-hater Jim Larkin, a carpenter from North London, said he wrote
a letter to the New Millennium Experience Co., which runs the Dome,
suggesting they should alter the lyrics slightly so that John
Lennon and Paul McCartney sing, ``All You Need Is Cash.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Funny,'' Larkin said, ``Never got a reply.''

THE TOP 10 GAMES OF THE CENTURY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the 20th century dawned, the British Empire's influence
touched all the continents. Its engineers, entrepreneurs, military
men, and workers seemed to be everywhere, and wherever they went
they spread the game of soccer. They played for diversion, and the
locals soon joined in, making the game their own.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer quickly became the most popular sport in the world. And
it resolved issues of amateurism to become the richest sport in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the millennium ends, the game continues to transcend
barriers and borders. As nations and populaces clash culturally and
differ on issues, soccer provides a common ground. In all 202
FIFA-affiliated nations, names such as Bobby Charlton, Johan
Cruyff, Diego Maradona, and Pele' are revered.
</P>
<P>
   The richest bankers in Switzerland and the most destitute of
Africans will have similar aesthetic values regarding soccer. Those
involved in the longest-standing disputes, the worst of religious
enemies, will equally appreciate the skill and style of Real
Madrid, AC Milan, Manchester United, Corinthians, Bayern-Munich.
</P>
<P>
   The modern game has been affected by all sorts of insidious
influences but retains most of the egalitarian characteristics that
were essential to the laws of the game as established by the
original Football Association during meetings at the Freemasons
Tavern in London in 1863.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer has such a rich and varied history that it defies
attempts to devise definitive lists. What follows are personal
preferences regarding the most dramatic or interesting games of the
century, matches I would have wanted to witness, or was privileged
to attend.
</P>
<P>
   1. Nov. 25, 1953, Hungary 6, England 3, at Wembley Stadium.
England's mastery is exposed by revolutionary Hungarians, who will
confirm their dominance with a 7-1 victory over England May 23,
1954, in Budapest.
</P>
<P>
   2. June 17, 1970, Italy 4, West Germany 3, at Estadio Azteca,
Mexico City (80,000). Scoreline from this World Cup semifinal
becomes a popular movie and theatre piece in Italy. Germany ties
score, 1-1, in 89th minute, then match breaks open in extra time
and Gianni Rivera nets winner in 111th minute.
</P>
<P>
   3. June 29, 1950, US 1, England 0, at Estadio Minerao, Belo
Horizonte, Brazil (10,151). One of the biggest upsets in modern
sports history. England, considered inventors and masters of the
game, fell to a group of amateurs. Wire reports of game are
mistakenly interpreted as England 10, US 1, an expected result.
England is so confident of victory that the great Stanley Matthews
was rested. Fall River's John Souza's ballhandling skills were a
key to win, as his dribbling late in match helped frustrate the
English and gave his teammates a breather from a relentless
onslaught. Joe Gaetjens, a native of Haiti, glanced in a long cross
from Walter Bahr in 38th minute. Gaetjens continued his playing
career in France, but was abducted by Tonton Macoutes and killed in
prison in Port-au-Prince in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   4. July 5, 1982, Italy 3, Brazil 2, at Estadio Sarria, Barcelona
(44,000). Brazil seemed to be the class team of the Spain '82 World
Cup, and needed to draw to advance to semifinals. But Paolo Rossi
scores three times and Italy goes on to win its third World Cup
title.
</P>
<P>
   5. July 8, 1982, West Germany 3, France 3, (West Germany wins,
5-4, on penalties) at Estadio Sanchez Pizjuan, Seville (63,000).
Goalkeeper Harald (Toni) Schumacher knocks Patrick Battiston
unconscious in turning point of this World Cup semifinal match.
Marius Tresor and Alain Giresse had given the French a 3-1 lead
eight minutes into extra time, but they collapsed after Battiston's
injury.
</P>
<P>
   6. June 21, 1986, France 1, Brazil 1, (Brazil wins, 4-3, on
penalties) at Estadio Jalisco, Guadalajara (65,777). In this World
Cup quarterfinal, Careca scored for Brazil in 18th minute, and
French survived a shot off post and a late penalty kick by Zico
that was saved by Joel Bats. Frances Michel Platini tied score in
41st minute. After a scintillating second half and extra time, Zico
converted and Platini failed in penalty kicks, and Luis Fernandez
scored winner.
</P>
<P>
   7. May 18, 1960, Real Madrid 7, Eintracht Frankfurt 3, at
Hampden Park, Glasgow (135,000). Real Madrid's fifth consecutive
European Championship showed just how powerful a team it could be.
Ferenc Puskas, who had defected after the Hungarian revolt had been
crushed by the Soviet Union, scored four goals, and Alfredo Di
Stefano had three.
</P>
<P>
   8. July 23, 1966, Portugal 5, North Korea 3, at Goodison Park,
Liverpool (51,780). Portugal fell behind, 3-0, after 22 minutes,
but Eusebio turned in a magnificent performance, scoring four goals
in succession in this World Cup quarterfinal. Koreans had already
upset Italy, but they would disappear from international scene
after this match.
</P>
<P>
   9. June 29, 1958, Brazil 5, Sweden 2 at Rasunda Stadium,
Stockholm (49,737). This is the Brazil of Didi, but it also marks
the arrival on the international scene of 17-year-old Pele', who
scores twice as Brazil wins the World Cup for first time, and
Garrincha, with whom the Selecao will not lose over a nine-year
period.
</P>
<P>
   10. June 25, 1978, Argentina 3, Holland 1, at Estadio
Monumental, Buenos Aires (77,260). Mario Kempes scores twice, once
in extra time, as Argentina wins World Cup for first time. Dutch
nearly won in final minute of regulation time as Robbie Rensenbrink
hit post with score tied, 1-1.

CARROLL LOOKS, SOUNDS LIKE A LAME DUCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Though Patriots owner Bob Kraft has been
hopping in and out of his winter vacations, coach Pete Carroll is
not really twisting in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll apparently is expecting the worst _ a firing _ because
he has been in touch with his agents concerning his employment
options. He does have two years remaining on his contract, but
there are questions as to whether they are guaranteed. Because
Kraft likes Carroll personally, there is a possibility that he will
do his best to get Carroll another job in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is also a slim possibility that Kraft retains
his management team, giving it another shot to right the ship.
Kraft knows that bringing in new coaches and managers would mean
giving them time _ a year or two _ to get comfortable, and he may
not want to endure such a delay.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft did ask vice president for player personnel Bobby Grier to
stay around Foxborough rather than attend the Blue-Gray college
all-star game over the weekend in Montgomery, Ala. Grier spoke to
the players in the locker room after Sunday's 13-10 loss to
Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   What Carroll doesn't want is another two-week postseason
evaluation period similar to last year's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not talked about that at all,'' said Carroll, ``but
I'm sure that will happen, because the Krafts will do what they've
always done and take some time to check things out and assess and
make their decisions. It's always been done that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two weeks is a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll has certainly been acting like a man who feels his days
are numbered. On Friday, he confirmed that he had a meeting with
assistant coaches and players to discuss the state of things.
Carroll would not elaborate on the meeting, but one player said
Monday, ``He spoke like these were going to be his last two games
here. He seems to think the handwriting is on the wall and
everybody on the team knows it. Those who like Pete are going to do
everything they can to win it for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The player added, ``There are a lot of guys here who think he's
a very good coach'' and that the players failed him. There are some
players who don't like Carroll, he added, ``but I think you have
those few on every team.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll would only describe the meeting this way: ``I thought it
was appropriate because I wanted to make sure that they understood
exactly where I was coming from going into the last two games. I
was concerned because of the performance we had the week before
against Philadelphia _ that we had missed the essence of that game
_ and I wanted to make sure we didn't miss it this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was important that we didn't show a move in the
wrong direction the way they were playing, and they understood it.
They took it to heart, and more importantly they took it to the
playing field, so that's what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if you don't mind, some of it is going to be more private
than you would like. I guess you may have to get it out of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The players were not made available by the team to the media
Monday, but one of them said, ``The way things are around here, he
knows the pressure is to get rid of him and some of the players. We
all know that. The players have to be ashamed of themselves for
letting it get to the point where Pete is going to get fired. I
just hope the owner can look at this thing and say, `You know, it
was the players' fault.' Because to look at it any other way is
crap.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Carroll, reports that he had met with Kraft during
the week to discuss his future were false, though he did speak to
Kraft after Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We briefly got together before he took off again,'' said
Carroll. ``He's been in Puerto Rico all week and there were some
reports we met during the week, but he came in just before the game
and left right after it. As far as I know, he's there right now. So
we just talked briefly and shared the lament.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was pointed out that two Adam Vinatieri field goals
conceivably could have the Patriots 9-6 and headed to the playoffs
_ in spite of everything else that has happened _ the coach said,
``That's the facts, and I'm well aware of that. It's hard to
imagine that just kicking those two balls would have offset all of
the stuff we've looked at here in the second half of the season.
But we would be 9-6 right now and we'd be in pretty good shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact remains, we stuck it on the 14 and we stuck it on the
15-yard line to win games and we've lost two games. It would have
made, I think, a pretty large difference in perception in how we're
looking at things right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how it goes sometimes. You pay your kicker to make his
kicks, and he's not going to make them all the time. Adam's been
our guy and we've counted on him to do great things and for the
most part this season, he's come through. And he's had two kicks
that got away from him this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have changed those games in a million other ways and
it never had to come to that, but it did.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll thinks his team will play hard and well in the season
finale against Baltimore. A victory would give him a 27-21 record
in three years here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to finish this year and then it's done,'' he said.
``It's the last week, so I can say that it's time to get this thing
over with and try to finish at 8-8 and that's the best we can do
and then see what's next and what lies ahead.''

YOU CAN STILL PLAN A JOYOUS NEW YEAR'S 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What, you haven't made plans for the big night of the century?
</P>
<P>
   Keep calm, cool, and collected: There is still time to party.
Many hotels are reporting vacancies, and the price, unlike a few
months ago, is now often quite reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   Travel agents nationwide are reporting that booking levels for
the much anticipated millennium holiday are lower than expected.
Carson Wagonlit Travel, for instance, says that levels are similar
to or, in many cases, lower than previous New Year's celebrations.
Carson's survey found most people are staying close to home.
</P>
<P>
   I can attest to that. Last week when we went looking for First
Night buttons in Chatham on Cape Cod, all we found were ``sold
out'' signs. Well, at least there will be lots of activity along
the streets of Chatham.
</P>
<P>
   And there are lots of celebrations nearby. Boston, of course, is
the home of First Night and promises a spectacular welcome to the
new century with fireworks, grand processions, the Boston Pops,
lighting displays, and more. To take in the indoor theater, music,
and dance, be sure to get a button _ don't be left out in the cold
like me. For button information, call 617-542-1399 or log on to
www.firstnight.org.
</P>
<P>
   New York City is another natural choice for New Year's Eve, and
predictions are that it's going to be the biggest party in the
city's history. For an up-to-the-minute report, check out
www.nycvisit.com.
</P>
<P>
   Like New York, Philadelphia is planning a 24-hour celebration
that begins at 7 a.m. Dec. 31 with a ``Rocky Run'' up the
Philadelphia Museum of Art steps and ends the next morning at 6
with the traditional Mummers Parade. And lots will be happening in
between. For details, visit the Millennium Philadelphia Web site at
www.gophil.com.
</P>
<P>
   For a quieter New Year's, head to Lubec, Maine, the easternmost
point of the United States, where most people will probably be in
bed when the clock strikes midnight. Lubec, which claims the
country's first ray of sunlight in the new year, has plans
revolving around sunset and sunrise. Both ceremonies will take
place at West Quoddy Head Lighthouse. Just before sunrise, there
will be fireworks, and at 7:06 a.m. as the sun rises, a children's
choir will sing. Other activities planned include a ``Run for
Peace'' from Campobello Island in New Brunswick to Lubec, and a
swim by ``polar bears'' in the frigid waters of Funday Bay. For
information on Lubec's festivities, check out

<P>
   The fourth annual Washington Winterfest continues through Feb.
28. During this period more than 60 hotels in Washington and nearby
Maryland and Virginia are offering discounts of up to 50 percent.
Included in a special Winter Calendar of Events are coupons good
for discounts at cultural and arts sites. For a copy of the

   Bad habits &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A special New Year's family program at the Mark Twain House in
Hartford should appeal to anyone who has ever thought of making a
resolution. Visitors will be able to join in a ``bad habits''
scavenger hunt in Twain's 19-room mansion, looking for evidence of
the habits Twain tried to break (usually unsuccessfully) over New
Years past. Twain took a fairly dim view of resolutions, writing in
1866, ``Every time I reform in one direction, I go overboard in
another.'' The program will be held twice on Jan. 8. Admission is
$20 for one adult and one child; additional people are $5 each. For
program information, call 860-247-0998, ext. 23. The Twain house is
open year round and is just west of downtown Hartford.

Berlin exhibit &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Berlin Metropolis: Jews and the New Culture, 1890-1918''
continues through April 23 at the Jewish Museum in New York City.
No major city in Europe grew as quickly as Berlin in the late 19th
century. By 1900 it was the third-largest city in Europe, quickly
transforming itself from a provincial backwater into a modern
metropolis. Jews moved to urban centers nearly a generation before
most other Germans and played a major role in shaping the modern
metropolis. The exhibit includes more than 250 objects from
paintings to letters that reveal the vitality and diversity of
modern art forms created and exhibited in Berlin at the turn of the
century. The Jewish Museum is at 1109 Fifth Ave. at 92d Street and
is open Monday through Thursday. For information, call 212-423-3200
or visit www.thejewishmuseum.org. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
2,000 snowmen &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year the people of Bethel, Maine, created Angus, King of
the Mountains, the world's tallest snowman. This year they want to
set another record and build not one but 2,000 (smaller) snowmen.
Everyone is invited to build a snowman at the site where Angus
stood, and participants are also encouraged to create snowmen in
their homes or elsewhere. The snowmen can be registered by sending
a photo, registration form, and $2 entry fee to the Bethel Area
Chamber of Commerce, PO Box 1247, Bethel, ME 04217; telephone
207-824-2282. Entries must be made by Feb. 12. Last year's snowman
was 114 feet tall and was named for Maine's governor, Angus King.
The snowman earned a place in the Guinness Book of Records.
Although 2,000 snowmen will take his place, Angus has not been
forgotten. This year's festivities include an ``Angus, King of the
Mountain'' photo contest. If you're not into building snowmen,
Bethel also has great skiing and other winter activities.

 &QL; 
The final dive &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among Acapulco's attractions are its cliff divers, who dive from
a 136-foot cliff into the ocean below. The dive must be timed
perfectly to hit when the narrow opening in the rock below the
cliff is receiving an ocean swell. On Dec. 31 at 11:45 p.m.,
72-year-old Raul Garcia, one of the orginal cliff divers, will end
his 65-year career with a final dive. Garcia was only 7 when he and
others began diving into the sea from a lower level to rescue
fishing spears and nets from the rocky bottom below. The divers
soon were diving from higher plateaus and began attracting crowds,
the beginning of a tradition.

Harper awards &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Harper's Hideaway Report, which modestly calls itself,
``a connoisseur's worldwide guide to peaceful and unspoiled
places,'' is offering a special Century Awards in its December
issue. The awards go to two 100-year-old properties, Ritz Hotel in
Paris and The Greenbrier in West Virginia. ``What could be more
appropriate than selecting the Ritz as the `Hotel of the Century,'
the much beloved Parisian landmark having been founded in 1898 by
legendary hotelier Cesar Ritz who wrote the book on the art of
luxury innkeeping,'' Harper said. ``Likewise the Greenbier, the
consummate Resort of the Century and a National Historic Landmark,
which redefined what a grand and genteel luxury resort is supposed
to be all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Among awards for the most ``captivating hideaway hotels of
1999'' were The Castle at Tarrytown, N.Y., and The Pitcher Inn in
Warren, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   Harper also offered some awards for destinations: Luxor, Egypt,
and its Temple of Karnak, was named the most stupendous tourist
site; Fiji got his nod for having the best natural drinking water
found in his worldwide travels; China was named the most
disappointing travel destination for ``its wretched pollution and
paucity of cultural artifacts''; and Southern Africa with its new
breed of luxury safari lodges was named the most exhilarating
travel destination.
</P>
<P>
   Copies of the December issue with all the awards are available
for $10 each by writing to Harper Associates, PO Box 50, Sun
Valley, ID 83353; telephone 800-235-9622; fax 406-862-3486 or, on
the Web, visit www.hideawayreport.com.

<P>
   BTV &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BTV stands for Before Television, and it's the subject of a
fascinating exhibit at the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge.
``Prior to the early '50s, mass-circulation magazines like The
Saturday Evening Post built their audiences around the visual
appeal of illustrations, especially on magazine covers,'' said
Christopher Clarke-Hazlett, guest curator at the museum. ``The Post
circulated among more American households, generated more
advertising revenue, and exerted more influence over popular
opinion than any other American magazine for the better part of
four decades.'' Norman Rockwell was one of the Post's top
illustrators. ``Before TV: American Culture, Illustration and the
Saturday Evening Post'' continues through June 11.

   Gift idea &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A unique guidebook to bed-and-breakfasts around the country
comes with a bonus, a certificate worth $50 to $650 in savings.
More than 4,500 inn listings are included in the book, ``Bed &AMP;
Breakfasts and Country Inns.'' The book, from American Historic
Inns, comes with a Buy-One-Night-Get-One-Night-Free certificate.
The book is $21.95, but if you mention the Globe's name, the guide
is just $16.95 a copy. To order, call 800-397-4667, fax
949-499-4022, or visit www.bnbinns.com.

<TEXT>
<P>
   As we prepare to toast the Year 2000 (known to some as the False
Millennium), let's look at bygone toasting traditions in various
parts of the world. The information is from ``A Brief History of
the Raised Glass'' by Paul Dickson (CrownPublishers, $19).
</P>
<P>
   --The Scots and Scandinavians drank from the skulls of fallen
enemies. A cup of unkindness, you might say.
</P>
<P>
   --The Danish used to cut the throats of Englishmen while they
were drinking. This led to the expression of drinking to someone's
health; in other words, you wouldn't garrote your drinking partner.
</P>
<P>
   --The word ``toast'' was popularized in the 17th century when a
piece of roasted bread was floated on the drink. No one remembers
why they did that.
</P>
<P>
   --The clinking of glasses was started to ward off the devil, who
is said to be repelled by bell-like noises.
</P>
<P>
   So let's raise a glass to Year 2000. Then let's clink those
glasses and remember the words of Benjamin Franklin: ``There never
was a good war or a bad peace.'' Happy Y2K! &QL; 
 &QL; 
Travel Trivia: Which state is nicknamed ``The Old North State''?
(Answer at end of column.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
In a name: Cleveland spelled backward is ``DNA level C.'' (With
thanks to faithful contributor Mike Schuster of Foxborough, Mass.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quotable: ``For a greatness of beauty I have never experienced
anything like New Mexico'' _ D.H. Lawrence. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Y2K excess: An underwear manufacturer in Japan has created a
Millennium Bra, made from spun gold and sporting a $1.9 million,
15-carat diamond. But it's for display only; the JAL Newsletter
explains: ``It's not real comfortable to actually wear and it'll
snag your cardigan.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
20 years of madness: Boston's ``Shear Madness!,'' said to be
America's longest-running nonmusical play, will celebrate its 20th
birthday on Jan. 29 at the Charles Playhouse. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Traveling the Web: Www.timessquare2000.com will cover Year 2000

cruise deals. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Today's loopy law: In Michigan, it's illegal for a woman to cut her
hair without her husband's permission. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Together again: Thirty years after they starred in the 10-tissue
movie ``Love Story,'' Ali McGraw and Ryan O'Neal will jointly
christen the newest Love Boat from Princess Cruise Lines, the Ocean
Princess. Their presence on Feb. 16 in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., will
mark the first time the two have appeared together since the film's
debut in March 1970. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Did you guess it? North Carolina, which is actually in the South.

FINANCIAL SERVICE FIRMS SET FOR 2000 BUG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ ``Krash'' and ``Burn'' are gone. And their departure is
a sign of how confident Fidelity Investments is of being ready for
the Year 2000 computer bug.
</P>
<P>
   For months, the cartoon insects zipped about the company's
internal Web site, a reminder to employees of the work facing the
mutual fund giant before Jan. 1, when computers may fail to
recognize the new year and possibly create havoc. But with Fidelity
in final preparations for the millennial date change, the creatures
are retired now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling very confident,'' said Bert McConnell, the Y2K
czar and chief technology guru of the world's biggest fund company.
``We may have some bumps in the night. But we'll fix them. The goal
is that the customer see nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial service companies are among the best prepared for the
calendar change, when some computers could read 2000 as 1900 and
disrupt vital services and record keeping. From banks and
brokerages to asset management firms and exchanges, the guardians
of the nation's wealth have spent billions of dollars readying
themselves and assuaging public fears.
</P>
<P>
   But few companies have undertaken preparations as extensive as
Fidelity has. Having readied its vast computer systems months ago,
the Boston fund behemoth has set up a starship-sized command center
and planned lavish buffets for New Year's Eve, when most of the
firm will be working. Few companies are as likely to be so wired on
chocolate espresso beans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fidelity has had one of the most expensive and elaborate
Y2K-solving expeditions this country has seen,'' said James Lowell,
editor of the independent Fidelity Investor newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the company _ whose chairman, Boston billionaire Edward
C. Johnson 3d , is a major technology buff _ is taking no chances.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity, which has spent $300 million and three years tweaking
70 million lines of computer code and 30,000 desktop computers,
declined requests by influential trade groups to promote the
financial service industry's readiness. ``We did not want to become
a poster child,'' said a Fidelity executive. The firm, privately
held and private in nature, also rejected proposals by CNN, ABC,
and other media organizations to camp out in its state-of-the-art
Y2K ``war room'' on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   The reluctance to be in the public eye is not for want of
preparation.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity, which oversees one in four retirement plans, claims 15
million individual investors, and commands 13 percent of the $6.2
trillion fund industry, spent $60 million building a computer-based
replica of itself in Santa Clara, Calif. The ``cocoon,'' as the
system was called, was a time machine running on Y2K-compliant
software, and was designed to demonstrate that system changes made
at the real Fidelity would indeed work come Jan 1.
</P>
<P>
   They did. ``We had zero impact on our customers,'' said
McConnell of the testing.
</P>
<P>
   With their dependence on utilities, global stock exchanges, and
data suppliers, financial services firms have had to draw up
elaborate contingency plans, ranging from emergency power
generators to alternative phone systems.
</P>
<P>
   But Fidelity, which has had 500 staffers working on Y2K for
nearly three years, has kicked into millennial gear in other ways.
To make sure it understood the public mood, Fidelity has
transcribed every Y2K-related customer call since January. Phone
representatives participated in focus groups to plot how to handle
customer worries. And since August, Fidelity has cold-called 1,000
customers a month to gauge their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The behemoth, which oversees $846 billion in assets and has
outposts around the world, also has kept close tabs on Y2K
preparations at 30 other financial services companies as well as
followed media reports. ``We've always viewed Y2K as being a
communications challenge as well as a technology challenge,'' said
Sheila Cavanaugh, who oversees Fidelity's Year 2000 communications
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   One sister industry that Fidelity has tracked closely is
banking, where consumers are now ``extremely confident'' that banks
are Y2K-ready, as required by regulators, according to a recent
statement by Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. chairman Donna Tanoue.
While the Federal Reserve and FDIC have cautioned that customers
may experience minor disruptions, including faulty statements and
automated teller machine freeze-ups, banks have readied their
ships.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens Bank and BankBoston, the latter now part of Fleet, plan
to keep some branches open on New Year's Day so that customers can
withdraw money. Fleet plans to increase cash supplies by stuffing
its ATMs with $50 bills as well as $20 bills. And smaller community
banks, perceived as more vulnerable to Y2K disruptions because of
their limited budgets, have made plans to go back to the
paper-and-pencil era, if necessary. Tiny Seaman's Bank, with four
branches on Cape Cod, has stockpiled old transaction forms, just in
case.
</P>
<P>
   With the doom-and-gloom headlines having moved from bank-run
scenarios to terrorist attacks, investors now appear largely
unperturbed by the millennial computer bug. Experts say long-term
fund investors are less likely to redeem fund shares than panicky
depositors are to yank cash from bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Fidelity is pulling out all the stops.
</P>
<P>
   At a secret central command center, Fidelity has installed six
giant wall panels, each with six screens, to display CNN, call
volumes, as well as information from stock markets and 60 Fidelity
minicommand centers around the world. ``It's not Houston Control,
but it has that air,'' said one Fidelity insider.
</P>
<P>
   Company staffers, it seems, will be wired enough to communicate
with other galaxies: Fidelity has rented two-way pagers, Iridium
satellite phones, two-way radios and cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   The company, whose retail investing branches are closed on
weekends, hopes customers will use its Web site or automated
telephone help desk if they have questions. Still, 4,700 service
representatives will answer the phones around the clock from New
Year's Eve, when the New York Stock Exchange will close early,
through Jan. 4. Even Fidelity's ``corporate reserves,'' which
include senior vice presidents, will pitch in on the phones if
customers call in droves.
</P>
<P>
   Only 10 percent of the 557,000 daily calls that Fidelity got
last quarter involved questions about the millennial computer
change _ less than the company expected.
</P>
<P>
   But Fidelity is taking no chances.
</P>
<P>
   The company has rented out most of downtown Boston's Seaport
Hotel, which it owns, and other hotels for New Year's Eve, where a
good chunk of its 9,700 Boston area employees will toil through the
wee hours. Although champagne and other alcohol has been banned _
``this is work, not a party,'' said one Fidelity spokeswoman _ many
staffers will be fed lobster tartlets, smoked salmon, Black Forest
ham with maple molasses, herb-crusted tenderloin, and chocolate
truffles, among other treats. Chocolate-covered espresso beans will
be in full supply.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in financial services say the real test will come on
Jan. 3, when markets reopen for the first time in 2000. Arthur
Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which
oversees markets, exchanges and brokerages, said Monday that he was
``confident that the goal of `business as usual' on Jan. 3 will be
realized.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, fund companies like Fidelity say they are concerned
about fund redemptions amid possible market volatility after the
new year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows Fidelity is intensely paranoid about its own
success,'' said Lowell. ``But Y2K has provided the ground for them
to prove that they can do it.''

PATRIOTS REALLY BUGGED BY GLENN'S FLU EPISODE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Terry Glenn was sick last week and more than
a few of his teammates are sick about it. Or sick of it.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, so is his coach.
</P>
<P>
   That seemed to be the case Monday, 24 hours after a case of the
red-white-and-blue flu kept Glenn home instead of at work against
the Buffalo Bills. Willie McGinest was mightily peeved about this,
as were more than a few of Glenn's other teammates, including Bruce
Armstrong, who remains the team's spiritual leader even if he no
longer is its captain.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, who has been playing hurt for more than half of this
season, was especially torqued off about Glenn's absence, but he
kept relatively mum because, as he said a week ago, the time for
philosophizing is done. All he would say was, ``I couldn't foresee
a situation where I wouldn't play in a game because of the flu. But
I'm kind of old-fashioned. These guys look at things different.
Everybody's different.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly that is true of Glenn, a splendid athlete who after
four years in New England has yet to grasp that eventually boys
have to become men.
</P>
<P>
   What he does is called professional football because it is a
profession. It is not about pompoms and girls anymore. It's not
about showing up when the mood strikes you or at whatever time you
deem appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   The job is about showing up, period. Glenn needs to learn that
soon because if he doesn't, one of these days someone is going to
tell him he doesn't have to show up anymore, and then it will be
too late.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean there are no sick days in football. It just
means that you don't take so many that you make the people around
you sick. As the Sage of Hofstra, Bill Parcells, once said, ``In
football season, football players play football.'' Sunday was
football season, but not all the football players played.
</P>
<P>
   More than a few of Glenn's associates (it would be a stretch to
call them teammates) were feeling under the weather Sunday. There
were broken knees and torn-up arms and aching shoulders in the
locker room. Even a few guys with the flu. But they came to work.
</P>
<P>
   With one exception.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn did not work on Friday or on Saturday, excused both days
by the training staff. No one has tried to argue that Glenn did not
have the flu, but when he asked Pete Carroll if he should come in
Sunday _ and, more to the point, whether he would play if he did _
Carroll did not like the tone of the question and told him to
forget it.
</P>
<P>
   Was this a medical excuse?
</P>
<P>
   Technically, yes, but there was more to this than Carroll
responding to a medical situation. It was a psychological
situation, too, not unlike many others involving Glenn the past
three years. But this time Carroll reacted like an exasperated boss
who simply tired of the mental games being played by a wayward
employee and told him, ``Fine. Stay home until you feel better.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to see a guy drag himself out of his bed and do
whatever he could to get here,'' Carroll said Monday. ``Then we
tell him he's too sick to play or too hurt to play _ and we had to
do that by the information we were getting _ but we've had a lot of
guys that have fought through it and made it. How sick was he?
Maybe that's what you should be wondering. I don't know that.
Pretty sick. They're all pretty sick. These guys have been real
sick.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't asked to show up. He was told to stay home, and his
inability to bounce back from the flu bug that a lot of our players
have gone through was why. He wasn't ready to play in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said about a dozen players have battled the flu in
recent weeks. All but two, Glenn and Ferric Collons, have played.
The difference with Collons is that he made the trip to
Indianapolis before it was determined he was too sick to suit up.
</P>
<P>
   The decision on Glenn was made in Carroll's mind Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want it to come off like I'm really questioning it
because I don't know,'' Carroll said. ``I'm not that guy. But we
always want to see examples of our guys doing everything they can
possibly do to get on the playing field. That's what his teammates
might be commenting about. They might be questioning that.''
</P>
<P>
   In his own way, so was Carroll. He made a statement to Glenn
when he told him to stay home. What Carroll was saying was, ``We
can get by without you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said early in the week that I was going to go with the guys
that are ready to play, that are going to give it a great effort
and all that,'' said Carroll, ``and there were some choices made
during the week to do that. In this instance there was no question
in my mind he wasn't playing. I told him, `You're not playing.
Don't bother coming. Stay in bed. You're sick? Stay in bed.'
Because I didn't see the signs that showed me he was ready to make
it back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to come down. He was told to stay home. There's a
big distinction there. On teams you have all kinds of people and
they have different character and different natures about them. As
you grow with these players and bring them along, you teach them
how to deal with things. Some guys get it more than other guys.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, despite 1,147 receiving yards and a 16.6-yard
per-catch average this season, Glenn doesn't fully get what what it
means to be a professional.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't get what his responsibilities are or that those
responsibilities extend beyond his one-dimensional world into a
larger universe that encompasses 52 other players and a busload of
coaches and staff, more than a few of whom also might not be
feeling that hot.
</P>
<P>
   Because he doesn't get it, he was left home Sunday despite
expressing a desire to play. He was neither fined nor suspended.
Something worse happened. He was told that his team would get by
without him.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this guy's case,'' said Carroll, ``I have worked extremely
long and hard to try and get a way to get him to contribute to this
club, and some of it has worked and some of it hasn't. Some of it
hasn't gone as well as I would have liked. I readily admit that.
It's a very unusual situation and a very unusual kid with an
unusual background. It's been hard at times to reach him and to get
him on the same page with the rest of our guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy didn't do enough (in practice) to be worthy of playing
in this game. That's what I'm telling you. He has a very unique
background and very unique qualities as an athlete. But he's a
challenge to bring into the fold.''
</P>
<P>
   He's a challenge his teammates and his coach have grown weary of
facing. He's a challenge they've begun to see lately as more a pain
than a promise.
</P>
<P>
   He's a challenge about whom one veteran said last week,
``Parcells was right about Terry. He needs somebody on his ass
every minute. Not just in football. In life.''
</P>
<P>
   The sad truth is that there is only one person who can do that
and his name is Terry Glenn.

UNSOLVED MYSTERIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Should it be ``Moby Dick'' or ``Moby-Dick''? asked Jeff Blake of
Portland, Maine. Where did Braintree get its name? inquired a
visitor to a convention there. Why do we use both academe and
academia, asked Richard Pline of New Bedford _ he didn't mention
the academy, another common variant _ and is there a difference?
</P>
<P>
   If wishes were hours, I would have found the answers and replied
to those and all the other puzzlers, complaints, dissents, and
amplifications readers have sent my way. (Yes, Marion Savio, ``the
man whom polls say is a likely next president,'' in a recent Globe
column, should have read ``the man who.'' Yes, John Fitch,
``Michael is friends with Stephanie'' is standard English _ it's
just one of those idiomatic constructions you don't want to look at
too closely. And yes, everybody, ``I graduated high school'' is
still considered inferior usage; say graduated from or was
graduated from.)
</P>
<P>
   But alas, this gig is not my day job (a word that now means not
a job done in the daytime, but one's main source of income), and
I'm not about to quit my day job. Instead, I'm cleaning out the
basket of long-neglected questions _ off with the old, on with the
new _ and delegating them to anyone who volunteers to help. Surely
someone knows the meaning of rotivity and can provide it to Herman
Brown of Needham, who's been waiting far too long. And Benedict
Aurian-Blajeni is dying to know the source of ``Curiosity killed
the cat, satisfaction brought him back.'' Not my department,
really, but some intrepid Net surfer or reference librarian can
probably reel in the answer.
</P>
<P>
   My own unsolved mystery is the origin of soup carrier. My
father, a small-town Midwestern lawyer, used the term to describe
someone _ usually a woman _ whose visits to an ailing neighbor
seemed to have ulterior motives: Hopes of being left that nice
cherry sideboard, say. (No, he wasn't especially cynical, but
small-town lawyers do tend to know other people's guilty secrets.)
I never heard soup carrier anywhere else till last year, when Gerri
Hirshey used it in a story for Food &AMP; Wine magazine; each
generation of her Italian-American family had a Designated Soup
Carrier, she wrote, and she had taken on the mantle. In Hirshey's
world, though, soup carrier is an honorific, not a slur; the DSC is
the one who takes the minestrone (or macaroni or vegetarian chili)
to friends and relatives in need of TLC. So please, if you know
anything about soup carriers, either covetous or generous, share it
with us.
</P>
<P>
   The toughest of the leftover questions came from Robert Nelson
of Concord: If you were writing in Russian _ in the Cyrillic
alphabet _ about the !Kung people of Africa, how would you
represent the clicking sound signified by the exclamation mark? I
couldn't find a Russian-speaking anthropologist or linguist with
the answer, but if you're out there, inquiring minds want to know _
or, at least, one inquiring mind does.

 BOSTON: ... seem possible.

<P>
   ``The idea of trying to fall in love just because I want to have
a kid is bizarre,'' she says. ``At no time was I consciously saying
no, I don't want to get married. I have an independent spirit and I
was lucky enough to be born in a time when more and more doors were
opening for women. A man looking from the outside would say that's
a pretty self-sufficient, do-what-she-wants kind of gal. Yeah, I am
self-sufficient, but I really do want to be with somebody. How do I
communicate both?''
</P>
<P>
   Right now what Feltman wants to communicate is her hypothesis
that ``there's part of your identity in how you make hair
decisions.'' She's interviewing Gilligan not only because of her
ideas but also because of her trademark hair, dark and curly and
still long at an age well beyond the time most women finally listen
to their mothers and get their hair out of their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' Gilligan laughs, ``I have a great story. I'm in San
Francisco at this big conference on the girls and the boys. I'm
doing my schtick. There's the break, and this women comes up. She
says, `You're talking about being present and being absent, and I
can't see your face because of your hair. All I can see is your
nose.' '' Gilligan runs a hand through her hair. ``For me to appear
in public with my words,'' she says, ``one way I deal with it is my
hair. I feel protected with my hair.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gilligan, arriving late to a meeting in the Brookline offices of
Facing History and Ourselves, nods hello to Margot Stern Strom,
founder of Facing History, her friend of a quarter century, from
the consciousness-raising days of the early '70s. That's when
``women's friendships had a real shift,'' Gilligan says. ``We
started talking about our lives and it was, `Oh, it's not just me,
it's not just my marriage, it's not just my family life.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're doing transformative work or revolutionary work,
trying to work on that edge, women's friendships play a key role as
it was with Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony,'' she
says. ``Women's friendships in that sense threaten the consensus
that depends on women not knowing and women relying on a male _ or
someone representing male authority _ telling women what women
really want or what women really think.''
</P>
<P>
   Strom, 58, sees her 20-year-old daughter, Rachel, in college
seeking the way ``she will impact the world'' and recalls going to
college herself with the simple goal ``not to be bored.'' She sees
Rachel looking for clues to how her marriage weathered the cultural
storm that led so many others to divorce. She remembers Rachel
``cried her eyes out'' when old family friends separated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women were really stretching and trying new things and
marriages couldn't handle them,'' Margot Strom says. ``I choose to
keep at it. My dad used to say I've had many wives, and they were
all your mother. I've had many lives. They were all mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Rachel talks of a generation ``raised by feminists who read
Betty Friedan and Doris Lessing,'' who form female friendships of
their own so ``powerful'' and ``heated'' that her best friend hopes
they meet the men of their dreams on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all feel very strong. We all feel very creative. We all
feel very charged. But we have a fear that if we fall in love we'll
lose our independence,'' she says. ``We don't know how to let
people in. All our mothers wanted us to not make the same mistakes.
Every move we make we're hyper-aware. It's better because we have
many more options. But sometimes it's tiring.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now it's back to Cambridge for a quick lunch to go from the Ed
School cafeteria. Tuna salad on lettuce, no bread, no potato chips,
prepared by Colleen Jones, 36, wife of a Boston police officer who
works nights to her days (``As far as seeing each other, it's like
dating''), mother of an 11-year-old daughter and 8-year-old son.
``My daughter, I treat her kind of hard,'' says Jones. ``She's a
black female and she needs to work harder. I have to teach her that
it's not going to be easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Next is a mammogram. ``I did have this moment of pause,''
Gilligan says, ``but I like being open about this part of a woman's
day'' after so long when ``anything remotely connected with
sexuality and women's bodies and breasts'' was taboo.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, this is the century when women gained control of their
bodies: Gilligan's visit comes 83 years after Margaret Sanger
opened a birth control clinic in New York, 39 years after the US
Food and Drug Administration OK'd an oral contaceptive, 34 years
after the Supreme Court guaranteed married women access to
contraceptives, 29 years after the Boston Women's Health Book
Collective published ``Our Bodies, Ourselves,'' 27 years after the
high court gave single women the right to obtain birth control, and
26 years after it legalized abortion.
</P>
<P>
   While Gilligan ties back her hair and awaits her turn,
85-year-old Barbara Stirling, clad in a pink raincoat, aided by a
cane, slowly leaves the medical building, and 28-year-old Gaea
Honeycutt of Waltham, wearing a gray suit, walks briskly to her
car.
</P>
<P>
   Stirling was born in 1914, six years before women could vote.
She's hopeful, but not confident, that her daughters, a catering
hostess and a house cleaner, will see a woman elected president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I think it's nice they're in Congress and senators and
mayors of cities,'' Stirling says. ``I think it's shown that women
manage things just as well as men. I didn't imagine they would be
so forceful and powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   Honeycutt, assistant director of corporate and foundation
relations at Bentley College, views the coming century as much
through the prism of race as gender. Her grandfather was a Tuskegee
Airman, member of a segregated black bomber squad that destroyed
260 Nazi planes in World War II. Now she's helping start a
nonprofit foundation to support grass-roots activism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women have gained a lot from affirmative action, but people of
color haven't gained as much. Look at Congress. Look at our
institutions. Who is in control? Who has money and who doesn't?''
she says. ``We're at an interesting time. There are a lot of
decisions in our courts and things happening socially that make me
think we're stepping back. At the same time, if it was just as bad
I wouldn't be able to go in the door.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the afternoon finds Gilligan in a small room on the
seventh floor of Harvard's Larsen Hall, leading 15 women in a
three-hour seminar on her method of interviewing and research.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the way Gilligan listens to women and girls and then
draws conclusions is political and not scientific, to which
Gilligan says everyone thought the great psychological theorists
were scientific and look what they did. They left out women.
</P>
<P>
   To Gilligan's right is Cindy Ness of Cambridge and New York, 40,
a social-worker-turned-doctoral-student interested in the rising
(though still relatively low) violence among girls. For this class,
she interviewed a single mother from the Bronx, a formerly homeless
woman abused as a child, jailed for assaulting an acquaintance but
never accused of abusing her children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girls are recognized as legitimately having anger more than
they ever have been,'' Ness says. ``They were seen as depressed
more than angry. As they have more room to express their anger is
there any relationship between that and their increased incidence
of violence? When boys are angry and violent we try to understand
that. We need to understand that in girls as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Her classmate Miriam Korn, 31, of Cambridge, is a resident in
psychiatry who says that even though half her medical school was
female ``we didn't know the rules the way the men did.'' Her goal
next century? To set up a clinic of women doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medicine just wasn't created for women,'' Korn says. ``There's
an implicit idea of competition and impressing people and this
culture of humiliating people and putting people on the spot and
valuing scientific fact and basic knowledge. The broader picture of
psychosocial element and relationships is given lip service, but in
practice you're rewarded for knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilligan's last destination of the day is a night flight to
Italy with Packer (``This is what I look toward: We're going to
celebrate collaboration over competition'') and their husbands,
flying across an ocean only navigable by boat when the century
began. The century has been a flight of sorts for women, too, from
the women's movement in progress when it opened to the reborn
women's movement where Gilligan claims a place.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an incredible sense of being part of something that
was very large. And it was amazing,'' Gilligan says. ``My work was
hearing the brilliance and wisdom of women and the contribution,
and also the pain at not being heard and the suffering. Then the
conversation shifted.''

BERLIN EMBRACES NEW ROLE,   IMAGE, CENTURY

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BERLIN _ Like many of the world's capitals, Berlin will throw
an enormous party New Year's Eve. This civic bash will celebrate
not only a new millennium but also a new role, image, and future
for the city.
</P>
<P>
   Festivities really began months ago with events marking the
German federal government's return to Berlin from Bonn, the
provisional capital for more than 50 years. Last month saw
observances of the 10th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall,
which led to reunification of the city and the country.
</P>
<P>
   The millennium program will continue through the coming year
with the theme of ``Berlin: Open City'' and things going on all
over town to highlight the changes that have occurred virtually
everywhere in the city. Most dramatic, however, will be
celebrations in the former East Berlin and along the site of the
Berlin Wall, only a few small segments of which have been preserved
for historical _ and touristic _ reasons.
</P>
<P>
   On New Year's Eve, or ``Sylvester Abend'' as it's called in
Germany, more than a million people are expected to jam into the
streets and squares around the Brandenburg Gate, an area resuming
its traditional role as heart of the city. Giant TV screens will be
set up in Pariser Platz, just east of the gate, so that Berliners _
so long cut off from the rest of the world _ can watch the turn of
the millennium in all the world's time zones.
</P>
<P>
   The Street of the 17th of June (named for the date of a 1953
anticommunist uprising in East Berlin), running west from the
Brandenburg Gate, gets transformed into what celebration organizers
boast will be ``the longest dance floor in the world.'' The scene
will likely resemble the city's famous midsummer Love Parade, a
nonstop rave that is to techno rock what the New Orleans Mardis
Gras is to Dixieland jazz.
</P>
<P>
   These happy activities are popular, but Berliners do complain a
lot about the enormous expense _ and considerable chaos _ that goes
with reconstructing their city, a task that after 10 years is still
far from finished. West Berliners often speak wistfully about the
Cold War days when their half was a relatively tranquil (and
heavily subsidized) capitalist island in a communist sea.
Surprisingly, many Easterners are also nostalgic about the
pre-unification past, when the standard of living was low and the
government oppressive but everybody had a job _ and usually didn't
work very hard at it.
</P>
<P>
   Memories of the past may be strong, but few would turn the clock
back. As all the partying and celebrating suggests, Berlin is
bullish about a future in which it confidently expects to become
again what it was at the turn of the last century: a prosperous,
fast-growing, world-class city.
</P>
<P>
   The Brandenburg Gate, standing alone and forlorn in the no man's
land beween East and West, was Berlin's Cold War icon. The
structure that perhaps best exemplifies the present state of things
is the Reichstag, the parliament building.
</P>
<P>
   Built at the turn of the century, the Reichstag was demolished
by allied bombing raids during World War II and partially restored
in the 1950s. Completely rebuilt to plans by the English architect
Sir Norman Foster, the Reichstag is now topped by an eye-catching
70-foot-high glass dome that has been hailed as an architectural
masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   The Reichstag is open to the public from 8 a.m. until midnight,
and there is usually a long line waiting to get in. Visitors take
an elevator up to roof level (where there is a pricey restaurant
with a terrific view) and then walk up a spiraling ramp around the
inside of the dome, which is situated directly over the
parliamentary chamber.
</P>
<P>
   From the dome, you can look down and see the legislators at
work. A funnel rising within the dome is lined with hundreds of
large mirrors that reflect daylight _ that is to say the real world
_ into the legislative chamber. A powerful symbol of open
government in a reopened city, the great glass dome is illuminated
at night with dramatic effect, and has become the signature image
of the new Berlin _ and a democratic Germany.
</P>
<P>
   If the Reichstag is the present, Potsdamer Platz represents
future Berlin, which is shaping up to be a rather glitzy and
corporate place. Before World War II, Potsdamer Platz was the
busiest intersection in Europe _ and may well be again.
</P>
<P>
   A rubble-strewn wasteland bisected by the Berlin Wall a decade
ago, Potsdamer Platz is now the largest construction site in
Europe. It's Berlin's equivalent of Boston's Big Dig: The direction
may be up not down, but the forest of construction cranes and the
snarled traffic are certainly familiar.
</P>
<P>
   The first phase of the project, largely financed by
Daimler-Benz, was completed last fall. A complex of buildings in
different sleek modern styles, it includes a gambling casino, a
3,500-seat movie theater, apartment buildings, a Grand Hyatt Hotel,
some 30 restaurants, and more than 100 stores, shops, and
boutiques. The second, smaller phase, being underwritten by Sony,
will be completed next year.
</P>
<P>
   Like its architecture, Potsdamer Platz's retailing is very
international, with Gucci and Pucci et al, not to mention Eddie
Bauer and the Museum Company all represented. The idea, obviously,
is to give the capital of Germany a sophisticated and
unnationalistic European Community heart.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the project (and they are numerous) complain that the
result isn't so much worldly as a place that could be anywhere else
in the world. There are, however, a few homey Old Berlin touches.
Among them, a small square named for actress Marlene Dietrich, a
Berlin native; and a replica of Potsdamer Platz's original traffic
light _ supposedly the first in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a lot of reconstruction and restoration going on
here, particularly in the former East Berlin where neighborhoods
that had been in limbo for decades are resuming their former
character. With the national government back in Berlin, embassies
are also relocating, with most of the major ones _ including the
British, French, and American _ to the prewar locations on Unter
den Linden.
</P>
<P>
   Unter den Linden is once again the elegant and palace-lined
boulevard Frederick the Great wanted it to be. The Adlon, once
regarded as Europe's most palatial hotel, has been rebuilt on its
original Unter den Linden site and is as posh as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Gendarmenmarkt, just off Unter den Linden, once of the loveliest
squares of Old Berlin and now fully restored, is again fashionable.
There are a number of upscale bistros and antique shops around the
square, and the Four Seasons Hotel faces it.
</P>
<P>
   Unter den Linden ends abruptly at Alexander Platz, completely
rebuilt by the East German government with a total disregard for
aesthetics _ it's a cluster of shoddily constructed Stalinist cubes
_ or its original appearance. There is talk of knocking it all down
and erecting an updated version of Rockefeller Center _ an idea
that leaves many Berliners cold.
</P>
<P>
   Since reconstruction, many of the historic churches and other
ecclesiastical structures badly neglected by the communists have
gotten the attention they deserve. The great domed Lutheran
Cathedral, for instance, has been fully restored and is frequently
used for concerts as well as services.
</P>
<P>
   Also restored, with its beautiful Moorish-style dome rebuilt, is
the so-called New Synagogue on Oranienburger Strasse. Built in the
1850s _ and burned by the Nazis on the infamous ``Crystal Night'' _
this was long the showcase of Berlin's Jewish community. It now
houses an exhibit on Jewish life in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   This flavorful neighborhood is again the center of the city's
Jewish community, which numbers about 15,000, and has several
kosher restaurants. Oren at 28 Oranienburger Strasse, for one, is
both vegetarian and kosher.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin these days is a complicated and sometimes confusing
place, but a visitor comes away from it with a sense of a city _
and a country _ putting itself back together.

<P>
   BOSTON _ They come to her every morning with a different story.
Liars and cheats, the whole lot of them, but Louise Bell, 76, loves
them just the same. Her feet snuggled in her slippers, she tries
her best to advise them, but they never listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't do that,'' she begs. ``Baby, that's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they are characters from her favorite daytime dramas,
Ridge, Nikki, Victor, Margo, and Victoria are like family,
dependable constants in her life.
</P>
<P>
   Outside her tiny apartment, the world she has known has slipped
away.
</P>
<P>
   Once a young nurse who worked breakneck hours, Bell has slowed
her pace because of high blood pressure and eye problems. She gave
away the stacks of Sam Cooke and Marvin Gaye LPs that gave her so
much joy, convinced that there was no place for vinyl in the
digital world. And the ritual of gathering with her large family _
brothers and sisters around the Christmas table in her native
Philadelphia _ is now just a memory since the last of her brothers
died four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of this state's elderly who have outlived family and
friends, Bell talks about her favorite soap characters as she would
a brother. From the perch of her armchair, she gives counsel on the
marriage of Victor Newman and his fickle wife, Nikki. And she warns
Ridge Forrester, like the son she never had, to keep away from that
no-good Brooke.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're with someone day in and day out, you feel that you
know them,'' said Bell. ``Like family, you try to tell people right
from wrong, but they don't take heed.''
</P>
<P>
   It is these simple, twisted tales of love, family, and betrayal
written for a much younger consumer that provide comfort and
friendship for the old and lonely. A half-century ago the soap
operas _ known simply as ``stories'' to some of the devout _ were
short radio dramas created to sell soap products. It drew an
audience of young, hurried mothers, blue-collar workers, and nurses
such as Bell who found a quick, needed escape in these nightly
tales of woe. Now some of those same fans have grown gray and
unsteady, outliving their contemporaries and feeling out of place
in the throes of technological change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many things have changed in my time,'' said Bell.
</P>
<P>
   ``My stories are the same. The stories and church are my life.''
</P>
<P>
   For many elders, their ailments limit their mobility and further
isolate them from society, said Alfred Davis, program director for
Amory Street Apartments, a senior apartment complex in Boston.
``They have seen these people, the characters evolve, get older,
and get into just as much mischief as they did when they were
younger,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eartha Lee Jackson has watched generations of families come and
go on the shows.
</P>
<P>
   She worked most her life, but began to follow the shows after
retiring. Homebound and alone, she might work on the gardening, but
she spends most of her day transfixed by Channel 4. She said one of
her favorite shows is ``The Young and the Restless.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nothing else to do,'' said Jackson, who won't give her
age.
</P>
<P>
   By 10 a.m., after she has bathed and taken her medicine, she can
hear the theme music of ``The Guiding Light'' blaring through
several rooms of her South End home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get up doing a little of something and sit back down again,
but this (soap watching) is about all I do all day.''
</P>
<P>
   At senior-citizen centers, though, workers fear that all of the
television watching makes the elderly even more isolated. Centers
across greater Boston are encouraging the elderly to take walks, or
join their friends in a game of bingo.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Harway, 59, a close friend of Bell's and a tenant leader
at her apartment complex, urges her and other seniors to come down
to the lobby and talk to people rather than to the television set.
</P>
<P>
   Although, Bell usually doesn't receive company until after her
stories have ended at 3 p.m., Harway enticed her to join him at a
senior luncheon the other day. During the event, ironically, Bell
won a portable television.
</P>
<P>
   It's ``the seniors' way of getting outside the world,'' said
Harway. ``The beautiful parties and clothes are an escape sometimes
when you are shut in.''
</P>
<P>
   Harway understands the strong draw the soaps have on the
elderly. He got hooked several years ago while caring for his ill
mother. He would sit by her bedside and the two of them would
whisper about the actors as if they were peering at their neighbors
behind their living room curtains.
</P>
<P>
   ``She would say, `Oh, look at her _ what class, what style,' ''
he recalls. ``Oh, look at Drucilla, what a nice girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Marie Watson, 81, loves Victor Newman, one of the longest
running characters on ``The Young and The Restless.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson, who uses an electric wheelchair, talks about Newman with
an uncanny familiarity. She remembers him through his good and bad
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, Victor has been around for a long time, '' she said. ``I
try to keep track of him, but he is always falling in love, getting
married more than any man I know. He divorces one woman and then
marries the next.''
</P>
<P>
   Stories that may seem far out to some, ring true for Watson,
Jackson, and Bell who have lived lives that have, at times, been
embroiled in their own drama. Watson was 50 before she met all of
her siblings. Bell recalls the drama of escaping a miserable
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I laugh at the characters, but they are really like ordinary
people. . . . It's like real life,'' said Bell. ``Take for
instance, ``The Bold and the Beautiful'': Brooke ran through the
whole family. She married the father, then Ridge, and now she's
trying to get the baby brother, Thorne. It can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   By 2 p.m. one recent afternoon, Bell was sitting in her chair
watching one of her last stories of the day. Something great just
happened today on ``The Young and The Restless,'' she said,
clasping her hands in pure joy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Victor Newman is back in the picture'' after being away in
Mexico, she said. ``I was so glad to see him.''

SENSIBLE TRIMMINGS

<P>
   DES MOINES -- In her sixth year on the school board of a system
that must cope with huge demands and limited resources, Iowan Laura
Sands is used to being accountable to the public for spending
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   So imagine her surprise last summer when she perused a General
Accounting Office audit of the Pentagon, which showed that $43
billion in spending couldn't be accounted for.
</P>
<P>
   That and a sense that $280 billion is too high a budget for the
Defense Department a decade after the Cold War's end overcame
Sands's reluctance to go outside her local responsibility and
endorse a campaign to cut $45 billion (about 15 percent) out of the
Defense Department's budget and shift the resources to domestic
needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize how unaccountable they are by the standards
I'm used to every day,'' said Sands, a moderate Democrat who leans
toward Al Gore in the presidential campaign, notwithstanding his
support of existing policy that will add another $130 billion to
the military's pile over the next five years.``But I do know how
great our needs are in Iowa in areas like education, health care,
and water quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Since last summer, another 18,000 Iowans have done what Sands
did _ joined Iowans for Sensible Priorities _ and there's still a
month before the party caucuses. By any standards, including
presidential campaigns, that is very impressive organizing.
</P>
<P>
   If this were just another top-down issues campaign, feeding off
the impending caucuses, her organization would be of minimal
interest. And it's a fact that its national parent, Business
Leaders For Sensible Priorities, has provided the resources,
including television and radio ads that are already up and running
here and in New Hampshire (the driving force is Vermont's Ben Cohen
of ice cream fame).
</P>
<P>
   The resources here include Peggy Huppert, co-chair of Polk
County's Democratic Party, and a relentless organizer.From the
start, working out of her home, to a frantic life today in an
office suite on the edge of downtown, Huppert has moved well beyond
the traditional base of peace activism on the left; indeed, she has
concentrated on broadening the obvious base, and her success has
caught national politicians' eyes, but not yet anyone's open
support.
</P>
<P>
   Adolphus Pulliam is even less inclined to this kind of thing
than Laura Sands. A basketball legend at Drake University and now
an official in its athletic department, Pulliam was attracted by
the richly decorated campaign bus (originally the one Ben &AMP; Jerry's
used to market their ice cream) parked at the farmer's market he
visits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was speechless when I learned about this issue, still am,''
he said in his office behind the stadium where the famous track
relays are still conducted every year. ``Then I was depressed
because everybody around here is working so hard with families and
kids at risk and it's never enough. And then it got me mad when I
see how all this military money is being spent, how the people want
their money spent and how different Congress is from the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Huppert's organizing is supported by national advertising (the
Iowa group also has its own spot running), and by occasional visits
from major supporters. The national group has recruited several
maverick former military leaders (Admiral John Shanahan, who once
headed the Atlantic Fleet, and Army Colonel David Hackworth, for
example), as well as former Reagan Defense Department official
Lawrence Korb, who has written a paper for the organization. There
was even an Iowa visit by as extreme a conservative politician as
there is, former New Hampshire Senator Gordon Humphrey.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign's proposal is not kooky or pacifist. The biggest
item by far would unilaterally cut the strategic arsenal to 1,000
nuclear warheads from the present 7,500, a level above what many
experts believe the cash-starved Russians are capable of
maintaining; $35 billion moved would pay for the hiring of 100,000
teachers as well as provide health insurance for 11 million
children who lack it.
</P>
<P>
   The other two would stop procurement of the controversial F-22
fighter (and enable HeadStart to be fully funded for the first time
in its history) and block production of new attack submarines
(providing the money to repair and modernize every one of Iowa's
1555 public schools, for example).
</P>
<P>
   The campaign's tracking poll as well as a national survey done
for the parent group show overwhelming support (close to 4 to 1)
for the proposition of a 15 percent (of Pentagon spending) shift in
priorities to domestic needs.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, however, the political and military establishment
is frozen in a two-wars-at-the-same-time strategy against countries
other than Russia and China, which not even the Pentagon considers
potential adversaries. Of the seven that are (Iraq and North Korea
are the favorites in the scenario community), the United States
outspends them all on defense by 17-1. And yet the campaign's
targets are weapons programs designed for a Cold War that doesn't
exist.
</P>
<P>
   In the presidential campaign, John McCain would at least fund
his new military programs out of existing spending. Bill Bradley
keeps mumblying sentences about holding spending constant, which
would net more than $100 billion over five years, but he has yet do
more than mumble. Gore supports the Clinton buildup. And George W.
Bush would throw even more money away.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs, though, of strong interest being kindled among
Democratic congressional leaders. If people like Peggy Huppert
stick around, this is an issue that could surprise. It has the
additional benefit of being the right thing to do.

AIDS LINKED TO INFIDELITY IN DOMINICAN REPUBLIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ABEL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JARABACOA, Dominican Republic _ The gushy ballad lilting from
the radio as the compact car cruises slowly down the street does
not attract the women as much as William's whistling does.
</P>
<P>
   Two girls in skin-tight clothes, idling beside a wooden shack,
smile back at him. And William, a recently married 30-year-old
whose wife is expecting a child in February, explains why a married
man is entitled to a few girlfriends.
</P>
<P>
   ``A man needs more than one woman,'' says William, a sales clerk
who would be identified only by his first name. ``The women
understand. We have our needs.''
</P>
<P>
   If some women turn a blind eye to their husband's affairs,
health officials do not. Infidelity, they said, is one of the
leading reasons for the spread of AIDS in this poor Caribbean
nation, which has one of Latin America's highest percentages of
people carrying HIV.
</P>
<P>
   In private, some married men compare their mistresses to branch
offices, while their wives are the main office. If he has the
means, a man here might provide his ``sucursal'' _ in Spanish,
literally, a ``branch office'' _ with a home, an allowance, and
even children.
</P>
<P>
   Although the practice is widespread, and women are well aware of
it, many wives are in the dark about their husbands' lovers. And
for health officials trying to control sexually transmitted
diseases, the prevalence of surreptitious affairs makes it even
harder to fight diseases such as AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main victims, and the fastest-growing class of AIDS
victims, are married women,'' said Martha Butler, director of the
National Program of Control of AIDS and Sexually Transmitted
Diseases. ``The problem is that they think they have nothing to
worry about. Married couples don't use condoms.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Dominican Health Ministry studies have found that more
than 50 percent of men have extramarital affairs, Butler said, the
surveys may understate the reality. A similar study in 1996 by the
University of Chicago found that 22 percent of men in the United
States admit having affairs. But people tend to lie when asked if
they have had sex outside their marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The problem here is exacerbated by ignorance and prurience.
</P>
<P>
   Few Dominicans receive sexual education. And according to a
study released in October by the Health Ministry, 44 percent of
boys and 36 percent of girls have had sexual intercourse by age 14.
So few used condoms, the survey found, that at least 78 percent of
the girls became pregnant, most of them in isolated rural towns
such as Jarabacoa.
</P>
<P>
   But what troubles health officials most is that 84 percent of
teenagers surveyed said they believed they could not catch AIDS.
``People are just not conscious about the disease; they think they
are invulnerable,'' said Carmen Capell, director of a health clinic
in Santo Domingo that treats AIDS patients. ``The guilt lies with
the state. We have to educate people more, and that starts in the
schools. But it's something taboo. People here are just embarrassed
to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1986, more than 4,750 Dominicans have reported being
infected with HIV, and hospitals across the country have recorded
more than 4,890 AIDS patients, according to the Health Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Today, more than 100,000 people, 2.8 percent of the 8 million
Dominicans, carry HIV. By 2005, the number is expected to climb to
at least 3.3 percent of the population, and an increasing number of
them will be married women. The Dominican figures compare to a
worldwide adult HIV-infection rate of 1 percent for adults and 0.76
percent in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, international agencies believe the AIDS problem in
the republic is much worse than the Health Ministry reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are sure there are many people going around with AIDS and
they don't know it,'' said a United Nations AIDS official in the
Dominican Republic who asked not to be named. ``We feel
underreporting is as high as 60 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The incidence of AIDS in the Caribbean is second only to that in
sub-Saharan Africa, where the virus has been reported in about 8
percent of the region's population, according to a recently
released UN report. Nearly 2 percent of the Caribbean region's
population is HIV-positive; Southeast Asia, with less than a 0.7
percent HIV-positive rate, has the next highest percentage of
carriers.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dominican Republic, where nearly as many women as men are
now HIV-positive, infidelity, ignorance and the church's opposition
to condoms are among the main reasons for the climbing AIDS rate,
health officials here said.
</P>
<P>
   Prostitution is another. The Health Ministry estimated more than
200,000 women and men work as prostitutes. They mainly operate off
the nation's booming tourism industry, which grew nearly 10 percent
in the first eight months of 1999, according to government
statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials, however, said prostitution is only a small
part of the problem, as most of the prostitutes have been educated
to use condoms. The real danger, they say, is for those people who
think they have nothing to risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Dominicans have extramarital affairs, that's a big
problem for AIDS here,'' said Francisco Ferreira, director of
education for COIN, a private group that counsels prostitutes on
the dangers of AIDS. ``This is part of the machismo culture, and
it's something very difficult to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Cruising through Jarabacoa's potholed streets, his sunglasses
strapped on even though it's near midnight, William points out
where the local prostitutes meet their men. But the soon-to-be
father laughs when asked if he has ever sought their services.
</P>

PALM PILOT HAS A HAND IN BUSINESS ON CAPITOL HILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A small metal device could end up destroying the
image of the US Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Though the tiny digital toy known as the Palm Pilot has been
available since 1996, its popularity in the nation's capital dates
from earlier this year, when it began showing up in the pockets of
gray-haired men on the floor of the US Senate. Since then, the
device has become a local sensation, if only because it captivated
so many political types so fast.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely do national trends penetrate the white dome of the US
Capitol, where congressmen still smoke cigarettes in open lobbies
and senators sit at 150-year-old wooden desks. Television cameras
were not allowed on a regular basis until 1986. To this day, laptop
computers are banned from the Senate floor in the name of
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   But the Palm Pilot _ the hand-held electronic address and date
book that lets users do everything from play Tetris to send e-mail
and surf the Web _ is becoming as ubiquitous as the cellular phone
in the nation's capital, and its use is expected to surge in the
coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore wears the $399 model on his belt. Senator
John F. Kerry has the $499 one with a solitaire game. The Pentagon
is ``buying them by the thousands,'' according to a corporate
salesman, with Defense Secretary William S. Cohen leading the way
with a Palm Pilot of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Senate sergeant-at-arms is on the verge of approving at
least three models of the Palm as ``supported products,'' which
means senators and their staffers could have them paid for and
maintained by the sergeant-at-arms, according to Liz McAlhany, the
office's director of customer relations.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the popularity at the Capitol is simple.
Explained Chris Lehane, a spokesman for Gore, who tested a Palm
device before it was available to the public: ``This is a town that
revels in its Rolodexes.''
</P>
<P>
   On any given day, members of Congress and staffers each call
dozens of lobbyists, business leaders, and one another. Phone lists
are also the lifeblood of lobbyists, reporters, and fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   The little devices are fixtures in the expense-account
restaurants near Pennsylvania Avenue, the taxicabs shuttling
between the White House and Capitol Hill, and the huge gilded room
outside the Senate chamber where lobbyists ply their trade. And in
phone conversations these days, the phrase, ``Hold on while I check
my Palm,'' is an increasingly frequent refrain.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm is, as about 3 million US consumers already know, a
variation of the Rolodex that can file thousands of names and
addresses in alphabetical order. It is also a souped-up date book
and note pad that lets users either tap letters on a digital
keyboard or use a plastic pencil to write on a digital screen.
</P>
<P>
   One thing the Palm Pilot is not, however, is new. Its first two
models were introduced in 1996, and four more have been released
since. The manufacturer's parent corporation, 3Com, declined to
give recent sales numbers. But last year, the Palm division of 3Com
made a profit of $569.9 million, and the division is to be spun off
into a separate company.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies make similar devices; Mindspring's Visor was
introduced amid much fanfare this year, with features that let
users listen to music and play video games. But industry analysts
say the Palm has an overwhelming percentage of the ``personal
digital assistant'' market, known as ``PDAs,'' because of its
simple operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Palm has the lion's share,'' said Tom Rhinelander, a senior
analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of which manufacturer a consumer turns to, the
product, he said, ``is really for what we called technologically
optimistic folks, people who like technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Which includes . . . the US Congress?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also for people whose average salary is over $100,000,''
he continued. ``It's a very elite product. This is not for the
masses.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Washington is not of the masses. Nor is it far from
northern Virginia, a blossoming high-tech center, which might help
explain a growing interest in technology among some in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Palm Pilot phenomenon seems to be as much about play as
work, with officials and their aides openly reveling in the
gadgetry as they search their address books.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in particular, has cultivated a reputation as a Palm-wonk,
and has been known to tease at least one reporter by showing off a
fake ``to do'' list on his device. Others, such as Nebraska
Democratic Senator Bob Kerrey, have taken them out on the Senate
floor to write down information or read memos.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Thomas Daschle of South Dakota reads the
news on his, while Senator Olympia Snowe, a Maine Republican, uses
hers to keep her schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've even seen some Palm envy among senators, some saying,
`Ooh, you have the seven,' '' said Ranit Schmelzer, Daschle's
spokeswoman, who has a Palm V of her own.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat, has been known to send e-mail
from his, and his list of phone numbers prompted spokesman David
Wade to joke that ``the Palm Pilot has made us a little too
accessible to him.'' But he will not wear his on his belt. ``That's
a little too pocket-protector for him,'' Wade said.
</P>
<P>
   John Inkley of 3Com, who sells Palm Pilots to the US government,
said there had recently ``been a spike'' in federal purchases. Even
Greg Garcia, the legislative lobbyist for 3Com, occasionally has
had to give Palm Pilot demonstrations to Hill staff.
</P>
<P>
   But should Congress pay for such a whiz-bang gadgets, especially
in an era when both political parties are trying to prove their
fiscal responsibility?
</P>
<P>
   Several congressional staffers admitted _ not for attribution _
that their bosses had already purchased the Palm Pilot out of the
office funds normally reserved for computers, and they argued that
the expense, while ranging as high as $500, only occurs once.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Ruskin, head of the Congressional Accountability Project, a
Washington-based watchdog group, saw no problem with it either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Members use their allowance for arguably far more frivolous
things like leasing expensive cars and staying in hotels too
much,'' Ruskin said. ``Scheduling is a big problem for members of
Congress. If this helps them schedule themselves better, I think
it's quite reasonable. You can come up with a million reasons why
it's perfectly plausible for them to have these things.''

HALLMARKS OF BUSH STYLE WERE SEEN AT HARVARD 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ George W. Bush was sitting in the back row of
his class at Harvard Business School in 1973 when a professor took
up an unusual case study of how paperwork is managed in a US Senate
office. Some students objected: What does this have to do with
running a business?
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know,'' the professor responded. ``Don't count
politics out. One of you could be president one day.''
</P>
<P>
   At that, a classmate recalls, most of the 80 students in the
amphitheater-style classroom looked to the fifth-row ``skydeck,''
where Bush was seated. The eldest son of the Republican National
Committee chairman smiled as if to say, ``Who, me?'' and then,
impersonating Richard Nixon, shot his arms into the air, his
fingers in the ``V'' for victory signal.
</P>
<P>
   While few classmates say they actually thought of Bush as having
presidential timber, it was clear to many that he was a leader.
Though a middling student, he was intense about everything, from
late-night study groups to captaining intramural teams to the way
he delighted classmates with his irreverence.
</P>
<P>
   While most classmates seemed rather buttoned-down, Bush would
chew tobacco, wear cowboy boots and play a larger-than-life role at
the school, fairly shouting ``Texas!''
</P>
<P>
   From Bush's easygoing style to his vision of ``entrepreneurial
heaven,'' the hallmarks of Bush's presidential campaign show up
clearly in accounts of his days strolling the halls of Harvard
Business School. Bush's 25th reunion might as well be held in
Austin: his classmates include many contributors, fund-raisers and
advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bush's two years here are perhaps the most unexamined
chapter of his life, and that is the way he wanted it _ until
recently.
</P>
<P>
   For more than two decades, Bush rarely mentioned his Harvard
ties or his MBA, bitterly remembering how the experience was used
against him when he ran for the US House of Representatives from
Texas in 1978. He lost in large part because his opponent branded
him a Harvard elitist. Bush's just-published autobiography, ``A
Charge to Keep,'' glosses over the period in a couple of pages that
mention no details about what he learned at the school.
</P>
<P>
   But with Bush's intellectual heft coming under question after
some poor debate performances in recent weeks, the governor is
finding new value in talking about his Harvard days, when his
habits of mind and character were on early display in a challenging
setting.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the memories of him remain vivid. One of Bush's former
professors, Howard Stevenson, recalled Bush as a student who
``wrote a decent essay,'' and ``didn't bust his tail'' trying to be
a top scholar, but who did show genuine leadership potential.
Former classmate Bill Strong, who photographed Bush for the Harvard
yearbook, added tellingly, ``I marvel 25 years later. the charisma
was there.'' By all accounts, Bush was a middle-of-the-pack student
who, far from being casual about classwork, had to work extra hard
to keep up with the assemblage of the best and the brightest who
got into the B-school.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was here, amid the stacks of the Baker Library and in
the red brick buildings along the banks of the Charles River, that
Bush set his course in life. He went to Harvard partly to establish
an identity separate from his famous father's. By the time he left,
he decided he wanted to be just like Dad, going into the oil
business and, later, politics.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It began as something of a lark. After attending two of New
England's elite educational institutions, Phillips Academy in
Andover and Yale University, Bush had joined the Texas Air National
Guard. He became engaged to a Texas woman, but the two later
decided not to marry. At 26, he told friends, he still had no idea
what he wanted to do with his life. Then one day, a friend
suggested that Bush apply to Harvard Business School. As Bush
recalled it, the friend urged him to follow his entrepreneurial
instincts: ``You really want to help folks? Go and make money.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's chances of being accepted seemed slim. He was a `C'
student at Yale. At one point, he decided he wanted to be a lawyer,
but his application to his home-state University of Texas law
school was rejected, apparently due to mediocre grades. To get into
the 800-student class at Harvard Business School, he would need to
present his grades, a board exam and a written application. More
than 3,300 people applied, many of them with better grades than
Bush's. Bush didn't even tell his parents that he was applying, not
wanting to disappoint them if he failed to be accepted. Having
followed his father's path of Andover, Yale and as an aviator, he
felt he needed to strike out for someplace new, to discover his own
identity.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was accepted to the school largely on the strength of his
written application, which Bush and the school declined to release.
School officials said that while grades are important, they do not
wish to fill classes only with students who receive top scores on
board exams. ``You could fill a whole class with people who scored
800'' on their board exam, said Stevenson, who still teaches at the
school. ``But you are also looking for evidence that they would be
leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   On that score, Bush was in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really think much of it when I applied,'' Bush said
in an interview. He was somewhat surprised when the admissions
office offered him a slot. ``I gladly accepted. All I knew was it
was going to change my horizon.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a tense time at Harvard. While many undergraduates were
making headlines with protests, Bush could often be spotted wearing
his bomber jacket from the Texas Air National Guard, which had
given him an early release to attend. There was a significant
anti-corporate mood among many young people at the time, and
Harvard Business School was ``not that popular. . .and not as
competitive as it is now,'' as one Bush classmate recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Harvard Business School could hardly be described as a
hotbed of protest against the war,'' said Bush classmate Nathaniel
Butler, a Vietnam veteran who now works for a Massachusetts
Medicaid program.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Corbett, another classmate, said he was stunned by the lack
of interest in politics at the business school in 1973, at least
compared to the atmosphere at Harvard College, from which he
graduated in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had come from the college, where many of my classmates and I
expected to be president of the United States,'' Corbett said.
``Everything was politics from '66 to '70, the whole focus, the
whole dinner conversation, was politics and public policy and civil
rights, and business was just hardly ever discussed.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Corbett finished a Peace Corps stint and arrived at
Harvard Business School with Bush in 1973, the discussion of
politics ``had diminished by 90 percent.'' The students ``had
become very serious and didn't want to be distracted by these
outside issues.'' Bush, despite being the son of the Republican
National Committee chairman, didn't discuss politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't political then,'' Bush said, and many classmates
confirm they barely knew that Bush's father was running the
Republican National Committee at the height of the Watergate
scandal. Only later, when Bush's father was mentioned as a possible
vice president under President Gerald Ford and then became US envoy
to China, did the Bush name become well-known. There were plenty of
students who initially were much better known, including the sons
and daughters of various corporate chieftains.
</P>
<P>
   To some, the political star at Harvard Business at the time was
not Bush, but Mitt Romney, the son of the former Michigan governor
and presidential candidate who went on to run unsuccessfully for
the US Senate from Massachusetts in 1994 against Senator Edward
Kennedy. It was Romney, who was simultaneously pursuing a Harvard
Law School degree and a master's degree in business administration,
who some believed would run for president one day.

   TAKE-BOS  
 CAMBRIDGE, Mass.: ... one day.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bush knew he couldn't survive at Harvard if he reverted to his
tendency to put socializing above studying, which happened at Yale
when he became president of his fraternity.
</P>
<P>
   So, instead of living on the Harvard Business School campus, as
many students did in their first year, Bush lived alone in a
three-story walk-up in Cambridge. Furnishings were not a priority.
He threw a mattress on the floor. Two sawhorses and a piece of
plywood made a desk. Curtains were deemed unnecessary. Bush's
favorite meal was the three-for-99-cents pork special on Tuesdays
at a Cambridge restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was there to learn, and that's exactly what I did,'' Bush
wrote in his autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   Still, like many students, he partied heartily on many weekends,
often at the Hillbilly Ranch, once a bastion of country music in
downtown Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike most students, Bush also escaped often to a more
privileged life, at his aunt Nancy Ellis's house in Lincoln and at
his parents' home in Kennebunkport, Maine. As one of Bush's
relatives put it, the Texan enjoyed Cambridge but needed to escape
what he considered ``the loony bin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd go to Maine as often as I could,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush went to Harvard partly to establish an identity separate
from his father's, the time he spent there also renewed his love
for his father. Bush's close friend, Thomas Riley, recalls that
Bush invited him to his apartment one day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to listen to something,'' Bush said, popping a tape
into a player. It was a long, humorous speech by Bush's father. ``I
remember thinking that he didn't think it was `uncool' to bring
over his buddy and play a tape of his Dad,'' said Riley, a Silicon
Valley entrepreneur who is one of numerous former classmates
helping to raise money for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   On another occasion, Bush woke up Riley with an 11:30 p.m. phone
call.
</P>
<P>
   ``Riley, it's George. Get a pen,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Write this down. You're going to make a million dollars. Write
this down: automatic dog feeder.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little wheel. It keeps the dog food and dispenses it
one day at a time when you're on a trip. Write it down. You're
going to make a ton of money.''
</P>
<P>
   But Riley found other ways to make money.
</P>
<P>
   The class of 800 students was divided into 10 sections of 80
students each, with Bush landing in Section C. Classmates say that
if Bush had been lazy or unintelligent, he could never have
survived the brutal hours and demands of the business school. By
all accounts, Bush threw himself into his work, preparing three
case studies a night and delivering oral reports the next day about
how he would solve an array of business problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember taking an accounting course that was really
interesting,'' Bush said. ``I began to see the tools of
capitalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said his grades were ``in the middle'' and believes he got
``high honors'' in some classes, but he would not release his
records. Certainly, Bush's class standing was helped by the
school's grading system, which emphasized strength of class
participation over performance on written exams.
</P>
<P>
   Classmate Peter Gebhard remembers what may have been the origin
of Bush's campaign slogan of ``compassionate conservatism.''
Gebhard recalls that Bush was upset about the way some people at a
company were treated in a case study, the particulars of which
Gebhard could not remember. Bush emerged from the class enraged,
saying over and over: ``That's not fair, how those people were
treated, that's not fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Casey, who also was in Section C, recalls working on
several projects with Bush. Casey, who today is chief operating
officer of WorldClinic Inc., of Burlington, Mass., remembers case
studies involving Eastern Airlines and Corning Glass. Bush, she
recalls, was given the assignment of finding stores that carried
Corning Glass products. He enthusiastically checked the shelves of
nearby hardware stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a lot of fun,'' Casey said. ``We laughed a lot. As I
recall it, you got a short amount of time. You get the case at 4 in
the afternoon, then do a presentation the next day. It was very
intense and his humor was appreciated.''
</P>
<P>
   Once, while Bush was waiting in line at The Galley, a campus
hamburger joint, he leaned into the cooking area so hard he knocked
over a heater, causing his jacket to burst into flames. After
putting out the fire, Bush found some duct tape to patch the holes
on the jacket, which he continued to wear around campus for the
remainder of the term.
</P>
<P>
   The school bred a certain culture that many graduates still rely
upon in their business life. As some graduates recall it, the
education they received about the importance of establishing social
and business contacts has proved far more important than the
details of how to tally a balance sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Romney, in an interview, said Bush picked up a style and
education that is evident in the Texan's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some students go to the school to get good grades and others
to develop judgment, and perspectives and to make personal
associations,'' said Romney, who didn't know Bush at Harvard
Business School but became well acquainted with him afterward.
``George W. Bush was not the bookworm type. He went to learn from
the experience. So my guess is that if business school helped him
at all, it was not a series of financial formulas as much it was
getting an assessment of the free enterprise system.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign has also profited from his Harvard connections.
Most of the classmates interviewed for this story said they had
given Bush the maximum $1,000 and a number said they have made
calls to other friends in search of contributions. One classmate,
Al Hubbard, is in charge of assembling Bush's team of top campaign
advisers.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from the business school, Bush discovered that
he wanted to do exactly what his father had done. He plunged into
the oil business in Midland, Texas, and eventually went into
politics . Bush got rich on his oil and baseball businesses, in
large part due to his networking of wealthy friends, not
necessarily his financial acumen.
</P>
<P>
   As a presidential candidate, Bush has applied many lessons from
Harvard Business School: forming a team of top people, and creating
a ``business'' plan for a campaign that appeals to the broadest
group of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harvard Business school is a very analytical environment,''
Bush said, referring to the school's Socratic method of teaching by
oral discussion. ``You are taught to analyze where there is no
right answer.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, analyzing aloud, he added, ``I'm not so sure that is
the case in politics.''

 c.1999 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is tempting to dismiss last week's bash in Panama as the
first of many pointless parties for which the world is bracing
itself over the next week.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that appears to be how the Clinton administration
wants it to be seen. Neither the president himself nor any of his
senior officials could find the time to be present when the United
States formally handed over ownership and operation of the Panama
Canal to the host country, fulfilling the terms of a treaty signed
in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   That is a shame. Admittedly, the United States' withdrawal has
been gradual, and Panama will not take charge of the canal until
Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the main reason behind the sudden diary clashes _
which caused even the secretary of state to be absent _ is that the
Panama Canal Treaty is scarcely more popular today in the United
States than when it was approved by the Senate by just one vote.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the handover warn of multiple threats to the canal.
They are worried that it will fall under Chinese control, and that
its operation will be jeopardized by Colombian guerrillas or drug
traffickers _ or, to be blunt, Panamanians.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it is only ten years ago this month that the United
States sent thousands of troops to invade Panama to topple the
unpleasant and undemocratic (though not especially threatening)
regime of General Manuel Antonio Noriega.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these worries are fantasies or the bogus fears of
partisan Republicans in Congress. Take the ``Chinese threat.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Panama leased the operation of container ports at each
end of the canal to Hutchison Whampoa, a Hong-Kong-based
multinational whose biggest shareholder is a friend of China's
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, Panama has no diplomatic relations with China (it
recognizes Taiwan), and Hutchison is a capitalist firm with no say
in the canal's operation. But even if it had one, and was a tool of
the Chinese, so what?
</P>
<P>
   As a big user of the canal, China shares with the United States
an interest in making sure it works efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's guerrillas may seem a more genuine threat. On Dec.
12, they chose to draw attention to themselves by attacking a
Colombian navy base close to the Panamanian border, reportedly
killing 45 troops.
</P>
<P>
   But that border is in remote jungle, some 300 kilometers (190
miles) from the canal. It has long been subject to incursions by
all sides in Colombia's wars _ with no discernible effect on the
canal.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, if there ever were a serious threat to the canal, the
1978 treaty would allow the United States to intervene. In fact,
there are two big reasons to welcome last week's handover _ as well
as one genuine worry.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Canal Zone and its military bases were a colonial
oddity, an affront to Panamanian and Latin American nationalism _
even if Panama's birth as a nation in 1903 was decisively assisted
by the United States for its own canal-building purposes, even if
its sense of nationhood is still a bit vague, and even if many
Panamanians now lament the loss of jobs at the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Second, if the canal is to remain competitive in a world of
bigger ships, cheap air freight and potential alternatives (such as
a canal project in Nicaragua), it requires big investment,
especially to modernize and widen its huge locks.
</P>
<P>
   It is more likely to get that as a Panamanian business than as a
distant but cosseted outpost of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there is no reason to doubt the ability of Panama's
officials to manage the canal (they have had plenty of practice).
Yet there are grounds for worry about whether the country's
politicians will let them do so.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, Panama has made progress towards becoming
a stable democracy. But corruption is still widespread, perhaps
more so even than it was under General Noriega.
</P>
<P>
   The danger is that Panama's politicians will seek to milk the
canal's toll revenues and the assets the Americans are leaving
behind. Panama now has a big interest in making sure that this does

<TEXT>
<P>
   It is tempting to dismiss last week's bash in Panama as the
first of many pointless parties for which the world is bracing
itself over the next week.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that appears to be how the Clinton administration
wants it to be seen. Neither the president himself nor any of his
senior officials could find the time to be present when the United
States formally handed over ownership and operation of the Panama
Canal to the host country, fulfilling the terms of a treaty signed
in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   That is a shame. Admittedly, the United States' withdrawal has
been gradual, and Panama will not take charge of the canal until
Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the main reason behind the sudden diary clashes _
which caused even the secretary of state to be absent _ is that the
Panama Canal Treaty is scarcely more popular today in the United
States than when it was approved by the Senate by just one vote.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the handover warn of multiple threats to the canal.
They are worried that it will fall under Chinese control, and that
its operation will be jeopardized by Colombian guerrillas or drug
traffickers _ or, to be blunt, Panamanians.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it is only ten years ago this month that the United
States sent thousands of troops to invade Panama to topple the
unpleasant and undemocratic (though not especially threatening)
regime of General Manuel Antonio Noriega.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these worries are fantasies or the bogus fears of
partisan Republicans in Congress. Take the ``Chinese threat.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Panama leased the operation of container ports at each
end of the canal to Hutchison Whampoa, a Hong-Kong-based
multinational whose biggest shareholder is a friend of China's
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, Panama has no diplomatic relations with China (it
recognizes Taiwan), and Hutchison is a capitalist firm with no say
in the canal's operation. But even if it had one, and was a tool of
the Chinese, so what?
</P>
<P>
   As a big user of the canal, China shares with the United States
an interest in making sure it works efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's guerrillas may seem a more genuine threat. On Dec.
12, they chose to draw attention to themselves by attacking a
Colombian navy base close to the Panamanian border, reportedly
killing 45 troops.
</P>
<P>
   But that border is in remote jungle, some 300 kilometers (190
miles) from the canal. It has long been subject to incursions by
all sides in Colombia's wars _ with no discernible effect on the
canal.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, if there ever were a serious threat to the canal, the
1978 treaty would allow the United States to intervene. In fact,
there are two big reasons to welcome last week's handover _ as well
as one genuine worry.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Canal Zone and its military bases were a colonial
oddity, an affront to Panamanian and Latin American nationalism _
even if Panama's birth as a nation in 1903 was decisively assisted
by the United States for its own canal-building purposes, even if
its sense of nationhood is still a bit vague, and even if many
Panamanians now lament the loss of jobs at the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Second, if the canal is to remain competitive in a world of
bigger ships, cheap air freight and potential alternatives (such as
a canal project in Nicaragua), it requires big investment,
especially to modernize and widen its huge locks.
</P>
<P>
   It is more likely to get that as a Panamanian business than as a
distant but cosseted outpost of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there is no reason to doubt the ability of Panama's
officials to manage the canal (they have had plenty of practice).
Yet there are grounds for worry about whether the country's
politicians will let them do so.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, Panama has made progress towards becoming
a stable democracy. But corruption is still widespread, perhaps
more so even than it was under General Noriega.
</P>
<P>
   The danger is that Panama's politicians will seek to milk the
canal's toll revenues and the assets the Americans are leaving
behind. Panama now has a big interest in making sure that this does
not happen, and so does the rest of the world. &QL;

   ``I feel about airplanes the way I feel about diets. They are
wonderful things for other people to go on,'' Jean Kerr, an
American dramatist, once quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Flying has become safer, faster and cheaper, but it seems ever
more stressful. Having successfully fought for increased
competition, to cut airfares, The Economist has now shifted its
attention to relieving the stress.
</P>
<P>
   One frequent cause is the noise that children, especially bored
ones, inflict on other travellers.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, we proposed that all planes should have child-free
zones, just like no-smoking zones: children (and parents) should be
confined to the back of the plane. As yet, sadly, no airline seems
to agree that children should be screened and not heard.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, we would like to raise another case of what
economists call a negative externality: i.e., something which is
nice for you but imposes costs on others. This is excessive
carry-on luggage.
</P>
<P>
   In America six out of ten passengers now take a suitcase on to a
flight, rather than check it in, three times as many as in 1990.
The result is delay, because flights take longer to board.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers trying to squeeze 3-foot suitcases into 2-foot
overhead bins hold up people trying to board behind them. Some
travellers have tried to take refrigerators, television sets and
even a stuffed moose head on board.
</P>
<P>
   The problems of both children and luggage could be solved in one
stroke by putting the children in the hold, to make more space for
carry-on luggage. But that, we concede, might be unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, to reduce delays, most airlines are rightly imposing
stricter limits on the size or weight of bags that can be carried
on to planes.
</P>
<P>
   This has provoked outrage as passengers are forcibly separated
from their belongings at check-in. Understandably: if you put
luggage in the hold, you have to wait ages for it at the other end
_ if it shows up at all.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have experienced the nightmare of waiting at the
luggage carousel until it stops, with no sign of the suitcase you
checked in, it is clear why people prefer to lug their cases on
board.
</P>
<P>
   You took a flight from London to Tokyo; your luggage and your
smart clothes decided to hop on one to Los Angeles. Not an
externality, but certainly negative.
</P>
<P>
   In America only 0.5 percent of bags go missing, but if you are a
frequent traveller that risk is too high.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of 150 frequent fliers found that two-thirds had
experienced some sort of delay or loss to their luggage in the
previous 12 months. And if luggage remains lost, your likely
compensation is paltry _ a maximum of $1,250 in America, regardless
of whether your clothes were bought at Wal-Mart or Armani.
</P>
<P>
   If airlines are to restrict carry-ons, therefore, they also need
to offer better compensation for delayed or lost luggage. At the
least they should extend frequent-flier miles to luggage as well as
its owner: if your suitcase travels to Tokyo via Los Angeles, you
should get triple frequent-flier miles.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, passengers could be made to pay if they want to
take extra luggage on board.
</P>
<P>
   Better still, given the frequent positive correlation between
the size of the traveller and the weight of his (yes, his)
carry-on, why not take a tip from Papua New Guinea?
</P>
<P>
   When flying within the country, a passenger used to be weighed
along with his luggage before boarding the plane. Fight the flab
and you can bring your bag on board. Airplanes and diets would then
indeed be closely connected. &QL;

<P>
   Defeated armies, like the Russians who limped out of Chechnya in
1996, eventually work out where they went wrong and _ as the
unfortunate Chechens are now discovering _ try to do better next
time.
</P>
<P>
   But military planners who reckon they have won, like the
Americans who oversaw NATO's air war against Serbia, have less
incentive to reexamine their assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   In the six months since Yugoslavia's President Slobodan
Milosevic sued for peace, hundreds of thousands of words have been
penned on the military ``lessons of Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   But to the dismay of more radical thinkers in the world of
defense, there is little sign of nettles therefore being grasped,
or vested interests faced down.
</P>
<P>
   There are some features of NATO's 78-day war that every
chronicler agrees on. So long as the definition of success is kept
fairly elastic, this was the first war in history to be won by air
power alone. The winning side lost no men killed in action and
suffered very few other losses; only two manned aircraft were shot
down.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it took much longer, and much more firepower,
to bring President Milosevic to heel than NATO's political masters
had originally expected, so the Pentagon had to scramble hard to
increase the number of aircraft and missiles used against Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   This tempted a man as usually sensible as Mikhail Gorbachev to
say, late in the war, that regardless of the eventual peace terms
the moral victor would be Serbia, simply because it had held out
for so long against so powerful a coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Pentagon, in its most self-congratulatory moments, has
acknowledged that the campaign against Serbia did expose some
weaknesses. The credibility of its claim to be able to conduct two
big local wars at roughly the same time looks distinctly strained,
to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Pentagon was only just able to field enough
``jammers'' _ aircraft which use electronics to suppress enemy air
defenses _ to keep the skies safe for its own bombers and those of
its low-tech allies.
</P>
<P>
   As Anthony Cordesman, of the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, points out in a forthcoming book, Serbia
could have posed a much more deadly threat if it had called on
Russia's best technology by using S-300 surface-to-air missiles.
Future adversaries will take the point.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a broad consensus on the weapons that saved the
day for NATO. Two sorts of satellite-guided bomb _ one cheap, the
other expensive, and both in embarrassingly short supply _ have
been singled out for laurels.
</P>
<P>
   One is the JDAM or Joint Direct Attack Munition, a device
costing around $20,000 which can be strapped on to a ``dumb bomb''
to give it deadly accuracy. The other is the Tomahawk land-attack
cruise missile, which can accurately deliver explosive power from
1,000 nautical miles out to sea, at $1 million a shot.
</P>
<P>
   The other technological star of the war was the UAV, the
unmanned aerial vehicle, which in Kosovo was used only for
reconnaissance but can almost certainly be used for more violent
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the UAVs could loiter over dangerous areas without
risk to human life or at unbearable economic cost (they are only $3
million apiece) was of huge value. Up to 15 of these gallant
machines made the ultimate sacrifice. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   So much for the winners. Among the losers cited by the Center
for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, another Washington
think-tank, is the whole principle of ``tactical air power'' _ the
powerful but relatively small and short-range fighters and bombers
which have to be deployed, maintained and protected at far-flung
bases around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The effectiveness of giant bombers based in the United States,
such as the B-2, is on the other hand offered as evidence that this
was a pretty good war for air power of the longer-range sort.
</P>
<P>
   Others agree with this assessment. Yet the supporters of ``tac
air'' remain robust. The Pentagon is still preparing to spend more
than $300 billion on three new types of tactical aircraft: the
F-22, which is one of the Air Force's pet projects, the Navy's
FA-18 E/F, and the Joint Strike Fighter which will serve all the
services.
</P>
<P>
   There have, however, been some signs of a political backlash in
Congress against ``tac air.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Lewis, a Republican congressman whose half-desert district
contains weapons-testing sites, led a successful move in October to
stop the first procurement money for the F-22. He would rather
spend the cash on more research.
</P>
<P>
   The fact remains that all these aircraft-building programs are
backed by powerful lobbies in the armed forces, as well as by
legislators whose districts contain the factories which make the
fighter-bombers.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that there is little evidence that defense
planners are taking to heart what is perhaps the chief lesson of
Kosovo. That would mean questioning the whole logic of
manpower-intensive weapons systems such as fighter-bombers.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kosovo fight, the average $50 million tactical bomber
which took off from an airfield in, say, Italy to drop its deadly
load over Serbia had to be accompanied by a ``strike package'' of
electronic-warfare aircraft and refuelling planes as well as
interceptors to protect it from enemy fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Teams of highly trained rescuers had to be at the ready to
recover pilots if they were shot down. And the tactical bombers
that were not operating from land bases needed billion-dollar
aircraft carriers to get them close enough to where the war was.
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining and protecting all these forces at overseas bases
was such an expensive and politically sensitive business that it
apparently makes sense for the American Air Force to send
$2-billion, two-man B-2 bombers, each of which can drop up to 32
big bombs or missiles, directly from the United States to anywhere
in the world, and then have them fly home again.
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding casualties is a costly business. So would it not be a
good idea to put some of the money instead into the development of
unmanned aerial vehicles which can do everything a piloted aircraft
can? &QL;

   Within a decade or so, UAVs could be as effective as manned

enemy's air defenses.

development of a technology which could make a generation of

   The Kosovo war poses a similar challenge to naval planners. If
the main purpose of sea power is to deliver explosives to targets
on land, is there not some cheaper way of doing it than building
aircraft carriers which cost $5 billion each, and need an armada of
other ships to protect them?
</P>
<P>
   An alternative exists in the idea of small ``arsenal ships''
which could be packed with every known type of projectile, and yet
need a crew of only 50 (compared with a big carrier's 5,000) and
cost only about $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   But so far the Navy has shown hardly any interest in these
deadly little boats. It plans to build up to 30 small new
destroyers, which need fewer men than the existing sort; but this
is only half a step forward. And it still intends to build three
new carriers. &QL;

   Vago Muradian, who keeps an eye on military matters in
Washington, says that there is support for radical changes in
defense technology _ including unmanned aircraft, arsenal ships and
airborne lasers _ at the highest levels of the Pentagon, and among
junior officers.
</P>
<P>
   The resistance comes chiefly from middle-ranking officers who
cannot bear to wave goodbye to the weapons with which they have
grown up. So it is just a matter of time, reckons David Bookstaber,
an Air Force lieutenant who has written a lot about UAVs.

<P>
   Defeated armies, like the Russians who limped out of Chechnya in
1996, eventually work out where they went wrong and _ as the
unfortunate Chechens are now discovering _ try to do better next
time.
</P>
<P>
   But military planners who reckon they have won, like the
Americans who oversaw NATO's air war against Serbia, have less
incentive to reexamine their assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   In the six months since Yugoslavia's President Slobodan
Milosevic sued for peace, hundreds of thousands of words have been
penned on the military ``lessons of Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   But to the dismay of more radical thinkers in the world of
defense, there is little sign of nettles therefore being grasped,
or vested interests faced down.
</P>
<P>
   There are some features of NATO's 78-day war that every
chronicler agrees on. So long as the definition of success is kept
fairly elastic, this was the first war in history to be won by air
power alone. The winning side lost no men killed in action and
suffered very few other losses; only two manned aircraft were shot
down.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it took much longer, and much more firepower,
to bring President Milosevic to heel than NATO's political masters
had originally expected, so the Pentagon had to scramble hard to
increase the number of aircraft and missiles used against Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   This tempted a man as usually sensible as Mikhail Gorbachev to
say, late in the war, that regardless of the eventual peace terms
the moral victor would be Serbia, simply because it had held out
for so long against so powerful a coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Pentagon, in its most self-congratulatory moments, has
acknowledged that the campaign against Serbia did expose some
weaknesses. The credibility of its claim to be able to conduct two
big local wars at roughly the same time looks distinctly strained,
to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Pentagon was only just able to field enough
``jammers'' _ aircraft which use electronics to suppress enemy air
defenses _ to keep the skies safe for its own bombers and those of
its low-tech allies.
</P>
<P>
   As Anthony Cordesman, of the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, points out in a forthcoming book, Serbia
could have posed a much more deadly threat if it had called on
Russia's best technology by using S-300 surface-to-air missiles.
Future adversaries will take the point.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a broad consensus on the weapons that saved the
day for NATO. Two sorts of satellite-guided bomb _ one cheap, the
other expensive, and both in embarrassingly short supply _ have
been singled out for laurels.
</P>
<P>
   One is the JDAM or Joint Direct Attack Munition, a device
costing around $20,000 which can be strapped on to a ``dumb bomb''
to give it deadly accuracy. The other is the Tomahawk land-attack
cruise missile, which can accurately deliver explosive power from
1,000 nautical miles out to sea, at $1 million a shot.
</P>
<P>
   The other technological star of the war was the UAV, the
unmanned aerial vehicle, which in Kosovo was used only for
reconnaissance but can almost certainly be used for more violent
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the UAVs could loiter over dangerous areas without
risk to human life or at unbearable economic cost (they are only $3
million apiece) was of huge value. Up to 15 of these gallant
machines made the ultimate sacrifice. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 475 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 575) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So much for the winners. Among the losers cited by the Center
for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, another Washington
think-tank, is the whole principle of ``tactical air power'' _ the
powerful but relatively small and short-range fighters and bombers
which have to be deployed, maintained and protected at far-flung
bases around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The effectiveness of giant bombers based in the United States,
such as the B-2, is on the other hand offered as evidence that this
was a pretty good war for air power of the longer-range sort.
</P>
<P>
   Others agree with this assessment. Yet the supporters of ``tac
air'' remain robust. The Pentagon is still preparing to spend more
than $300 billion on three new types of tactical aircraft: the
F-22, which is one of the Air Force's pet projects, the Navy's

<P>
   There must have been plenty of times over the years, given what
the world now knows about them, when Hillary Rodham Clinton dreamed
of putting some distance between herself and her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as her campaign to become a senator for New York gathers
pace, she is at last getting a chance to fulfil that dream.
</P>
<P>
   She is spending more time living in the state that she hopes to
represent; and she is also putting some light between herself and
her presidential husband on a growing range of issues, from the
economic (federal subsidies for New York hospitals) to the highly
emotional (the ``Don't ask, don't tell'' policy for homosexuals in
the American armed forces).
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's candidacy is drawing attention for all sorts of
reasons. For one thing, she is the first presidential spouse to
move on from her husband's penumbra to run for office in her own
right.
</P>
<P>
   She is also a polarizing personality who is engaged in one of
the most delicate political operations imaginable, creating a
distance from her husband without opening up a rift with him.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest reason for the interest is that people think
that her campaign may finally reveal the solution to a conundrum
that has puzzled America for years.
</P>
<P>
   Is Mrs. Clinton the real power behind the throne, the brains,
backbone and guts of the Bill-and-Hillary partnership, as many in
her camp have long argued? Or is she a free-rider, a woman who
could never make it on her own, but who has used her husband's
political genius to exercise power without accountability?
</P>
<P>
   So far the auguries do not look good for the Hillary camp. Her
belated discovery that she is a Yankees baseball fan served only to
emphasize her status as a carpetbagger. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (100-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 200) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Her attempts to pander to New York's militant minorities have
repeatedly backfired, most famously when she endorsed her husband's
pardon of a bunch of Puerto Rican nationalists, only to backpedal
later.
</P>
<P>
   Then, more recently, she declared that she wants to march in the
St. Patrick's Day parade, only to learn that New York's gays are
locked in a furious dispute with the parade's organizers.
</P>
<P>
   She is also treading on dangerous ground when she accuses
Rudolph Giuliani, New York's mayor and her likely competitor for
the Senate, of ``criminalizing the homeless.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 100-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;

</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers may not be as hard-hearted as they like to appear.
But they do not want to go back to the days when the streets were a
panhandler's paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Mrs. Clinton's fumblings result from her ambiguous
status, part official figure, part candidate. Jewish groups
lambasted her for sitting in silence while Yasser Arafat's wife
launched into an anti-Israeli rant. But as first lady she has
learned that silence is usually the best course.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Giuliani has accused her official airplane _ a small
15-seater _ of delaying regular commercial traffic at La Guardia
Airport, and his supporters have repeatedly bitched about her
Secret Service guards. But for the country's first lady a retinue
is not an optional extra.
</P>
<P>
   Other fumblings can be explained by the fact that she is a
newcomer to New York's high-voltage politics. Yet a glance at her
past suggests that in fact her problems go deeper than this.
</P>
<P>
   From her decision to keep her maiden name when she got married
(despite the fact that she was living in Arkansas), to her
dismissal of women who stay at home and bake cookies, she has
repeatedly revealed a tin ear for politics.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton was responsible for one of the great policy fiascos
of recent decades: an elaborate plan to reorganize America's
health-care system that was meant to be the centerpiece of the
first Clinton administration but, for lack of political
preparation, died as soon as it reached Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   On the scandal front, she was up to her elbows in Travelgate and
Filegate. And it was Mrs. Clinton's stonewalling over Whitewater
that led to Kenneth Starr's investigation and, by extension, to the
whole impeachment fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is one of the best public speakers in the business.
She is also relentlessly organized and focused. (Even a casual
meeting with her elicits a note about how good it was to meet you.)
</P>
<P>
   In the White House's darkest moments it has usually been Mrs.
Clinton who has organized the defenses and stiffened the troops'
morale.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1998 she stormed across the country boosting
endangered candidates, raising money for her party and lambasting
the ``right-wing conspiracy'' _ carrying the banner, indeed, while
her husband stayed in the shadows.
</P>
<P>
   Yet she lacks two qualities that her husband possesses in
spades. The first is a capacity for moral ambiguity. Mrs. Clinton
not only disagrees with her opponents. She regards them as moral
reprobates _ members of a great reactionary plot that must be
fought at all costs.
</P>
<P>
   Her second lack is the human touch. Mrs. Clinton's tin ear is
the result of her deep lack of interest in people, at least as
living, feeling individuals.
</P>
<P>
   It never occurred to her during the health-care battle that, in
dealing with politicians, you need to stroke their egos as well as
dazzle them with your intellect. And she is even less sympathetic
when it comes to dealing with what one citizen of her newly adopted
home state once referred to as ``the little people.''
</P>
<P>
   One Clintonologist argues that she has ``a high usefulness
quotient'' _ it is only useful people she cozies up to.
</P>
<P>
   ``She never offered us a cup of coffee,'' complained one member
of her police detail back in the Arkansas days. ``She was like a
robot. Her actions were that way to anybody who wasn't on her
level. You were just in her way.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the debate about who is the real power in the
Clinton partnership is that it misses the point: they both are.
</P>
<P>
   The crises that have punctuated the president's career have
repeatedly underlined how much Bill needs Hillary's backbone and
moral absolutism. Now the first lady's fumblings in New York are
underlining how much Hillary needs Bill's political instincts.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since they met at Yale in 1970 they have been one of the
great political partnerships, held together by their differences.
But an ex-president is hardly likely to make a new career as a
campaign manager; and Mrs. Clinton can hardly become a political
player in her own right if she is seen as her husband's cat's-paw.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton's great good fortune was that he could make his
career as the front man of a partnership. Mrs. Clinton's great
problem is that, to succeed, she has to leave that partnership
behind. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   There must have been plenty of times over the years, given what
the world now knows about them, when Hillary Rodham Clinton dreamed
of putting some distance between herself and her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as her campaign to become a senator for New York gathers
pace, she is at last getting a chance to fulfil that dream.
</P>
<P>
   She is spending more time living in the state that she hopes to
represent; and she is also putting some light between herself and
her presidential husband on a growing range of issues, from the
economic (federal subsidies for New York hospitals) to the highly
emotional (the ``Don't ask, don't tell'' policy for homosexuals in
the American armed forces).
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's candidacy is drawing attention for all sorts of
reasons. For one thing, she is the first presidential spouse to
move on from her husband's penumbra to run for office in her own
right.
</P>
<P>
   She is also a polarizing personality who is engaged in one of
the most delicate political operations imaginable, creating a
distance from her husband without opening up a rift with him.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest reason for the interest is that people think
that her campaign may finally reveal the solution to a conundrum
that has puzzled America for years.
</P>
<P>
   Is Mrs. Clinton the real power behind the throne, the brains,
backbone and guts of the Bill-and-Hillary partnership, as many in
her camp have long argued? Or is she a free-rider, a woman who
could never make it on her own, but who has used her husband's
political genius to exercise power without accountability?
</P>
<P>
   So far the auguries do not look good for the Hillary camp. Her
belated discovery that she is a Yankees baseball fan served only to
emphasize her status as a carpetbagger. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (100-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 200) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Her attempts to pander to New York's militant minorities have
repeatedly backfired, most famously when she endorsed her husband's
pardon of a bunch of Puerto Rican nationalists, only to backpedal
later.
</P>
<P>
   Then, more recently, she declared that she wants to march in the
St. Patrick's Day parade, only to learn that New York's gays are
locked in a furious dispute with the parade's organizers.
</P>
<P>
   She is also treading on dangerous ground when she accuses
Rudolph Giuliani, New York's mayor and her likely competitor for
the Senate, of ``criminalizing the homeless.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 100-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers may not be as hard-hearted as they like to appear.
But they do not want to go back to the days when the streets were a
panhandler's paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Mrs. Clinton's fumblings result from her ambiguous
status, part official figure, part candidate. Jewish groups
lambasted her for sitting in silence while Yasser Arafat's wife
launched into an anti-Israeli rant. But as first lady she has
learned that silence is usually the best course.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Giuliani has accused her official airplane _ a small
15-seater _ of delaying regular commercial traffic at La Guardia
Airport, and his supporters have repeatedly bitched about her
Secret Service guards. But for the country's first lady a retinue
is not an optional extra.
</P>
<P>
   Other fumblings can be explained by the fact that she is a
newcomer to New York's high-voltage politics. Yet a glance at her
past suggests that in fact her problems go deeper than this.
</P>
<P>
   From her decision to keep her maiden name when she got married
(despite the fact that she was living in Arkansas), to her
dismissal of women who stay at home and bake cookies, she has
repeatedly revealed a tin ear for politics.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton was responsible for one of the great policy fiascos
of recent decades: an elaborate plan to reorganize America's
health-care system that was meant to be the centerpiece of the
first Clinton administration but, for lack of political
preparation, died as soon as it reached Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   On the scandal front, she was up to her elbows in Travelgate and
Filegate. And it was Mrs. Clinton's stonewalling over Whitewater
that led to Kenneth Starr's investigation and, by extension, to the
whole impeachment fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is one of the best public speakers in the business.
She is also relentlessly organized and focused. (Even a casual
meeting with her elicits a note about how good it was to meet you.)
</P>
<P>
   In the White House's darkest moments it has usually been Mrs.
Clinton who has organized the defenses and stiffened the troops'
morale.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1998 she stormed across the country boosting
endangered candidates, raising money for her party and lambasting
the ``right-wing conspiracy'' _ carrying the banner, indeed, while
her husband stayed in the shadows.
</P>
<P>
   Yet she lacks two qualities that her husband possesses in
spades. The first is a capacity for moral ambiguity. Mrs. Clinton
not only disagrees with her opponents. She regards them as moral
reprobates _ members of a great reactionary plot that must be
fought at all costs.
</P>
<P>
   Her second lack is the human touch. Mrs. Clinton's tin ear is
the result of her deep lack of interest in people, at least as
living, feeling individuals.
</P>
<P>
   It never occurred to her during the health-care battle that, in
dealing with politicians, you need to stroke their egos as well as
dazzle them with your intellect. And she is even less sympathetic
when it comes to dealing with what one citizen of her newly adopted
home state once referred to as ``the little people.''
</P>
<P>
   One Clintonologist argues that she has ``a high usefulness
quotient'' _ it is only useful people she cozies up to.
</P>
<P>
   ``She never offered us a cup of coffee,'' complained one member
of her police detail back in the Arkansas days. ``She was like a
robot. Her actions were that way to anybody who wasn't on her
level. You were just in her way.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the debate about who is the real power in the
Clinton partnership is that it misses the point: they both are.
</P>
<P>
   The crises that have punctuated the president's career have
repeatedly underlined how much Bill needs Hillary's backbone and
moral absolutism. Now the first lady's fumblings in New York are
underlining how much Hillary needs Bill's political instincts.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since they met at Yale in 1970 they have been one of the
great political partnerships, held together by their differences.
But an ex-president is hardly likely to make a new career as a
campaign manager; and Mrs. Clinton can hardly become a political
player in her own right if she is seen as her husband's cat's-paw.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton's great good fortune was that he could make his
career as the front man of a partnership. Mrs. Clinton's great
problem is that, to succeed, she has to leave that partnership
behind. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The shop is open, but you cannot get through the door
for the crowds flooding in from across the country. After you
finally squeeze inside, you have a question.
</P>
<P>
   A sales assistant asks you to write it down and tells you that
someone might reply _ after next Tuesday. You fill your shopping
basket anyway. At the till, however, the cashier removes several
items from your cart: ``Sorry, these are just for display. We are
sold out.''
</P>
<P>
   At home, you discover your credit card has been charged anyway _
twice, in fact. And, mysteriously, your bag contains things you
have never seen before.
</P>
<P>
   You go back to the store to complain. The sales assistant has no
memory of who you are or of what you bought. He suggests you
auction your unwanted purchases on eBay.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody would accept such treatment in a real shop. But Internet
shopping is blighted by overburdened Web sites without a precise
idea of their inventory, or of how to serve customers, or of when
deliveries will arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Last Christmas e-commerce was still a novelty, and customers
were willing to put up with all sorts of shortcomings. But with
sales expected to double to $6 billion this year, online shopping
is past being a prototype. Customers expect to be treated well.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has done everything in its power to raise their
expectations. The airwaves are echoing with jingles promising
perfect online shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Yet most online retailers are merely pretty facades. Their
priority is to create a buzz (what Web retailers dignify as ``brand
building'') so as to attract traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, only 5-20 percent of their investment goes on
merchandising, logistics and fulfillment, estimates Keng Lim, boss
of Escalate, which provides back-office systems for Internet
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Boo.com, a Swedish sports-fashion retailer, spent $100 million
on public relations and advertising before it had even freed its
Web site from bugs. Few Internet entrepreneurs have enough
retailing experience to build the logistics and customer management
that stand behind a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``God knows how often I have been in a room with a 27-year-old
guy who can dream up a fancy Web site, but hasn't a clue about the
complexities of the back office,'' scoffs Harold Hughes, of
Pandesic, which sells computer systems to Web merchants.
</P>
<P>
   This might seem hopelessly shortsighted. Yet, according to the
received wisdom of the Internet, building a business in such a
lopsided way might be the clever _ and possibly the only _ thing to
do.
</P>
<P>
   Most online retailers believe they are in a sprint to gain
market share over Christmas. Send.com, an upmarket gift site, has
spent $20 million on marketing in the past eight weeks _ five times
its original budget.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lannon, its chief executive, thinks the strategy is
sound: ``I look at this like an election campaign. If the election
is in December it doesn't make sense to say in January, I wish we
had spent more money.''
</P>
<P>
   Only the two or three firms with the largest sales in their
niche will be able to raise fresh money next year. The rest are
likely either to fail or to be bought.
</P>
<P>
   Perversely, even those that go bankrupt may succeed financially:
if a site has attracted a decent amount of traffic, a buyer may
think it worth enough to make its founders rich.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the approach is creating jerry-built companies.
PricewaterhouseCoopers, an accounting firm and consultancy, has
devised a measure of quality, called BetterWeb, which analyzes such
things as orders, returns and complaints.
</P>
<P>
   None of the 300 e-merchants it has surveyed passes muster.
Sometimes the lack of experience borders on naivete.
</P>
<P>
   Eve.com, a beauty-products site, tried to sell perfumes, only to
discover that these were classed as ``hazardous materials'' and
that to ship them via UPS required a license. That took months to
get.
</P>
<P>
   Most shortcomings are to do with computers and therefore harder
to fix. Even the best sites, such as eBay, are prone to crash or
are struggling to find skilled IT professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Others have fallen into the trap of buying software packages
that suited them when they were small, but which cannot be scaled
up to process larger volumes.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of Internet retailers racing towards Christmas have had
neither the time nor the money to build systems that can cope with
huge, unpredictable surges in web traffic.
</P>
<P>
   However, the most gruelling struggle is to tie together old
computer systems so as to link their Web sites to data banks and
warehouses. Only then can firms know what is in stock, guarantee
delivery times and let customers track orders.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Sharp, who left Microsoft to become the chief technology
officer at iTurf, a Web site and catalogue retailer for teenagers,
says that without integrated systems firms cannot assess what
people are doing on their site or the value of an advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lack of technical experience will show how flaky many of these
companies are,'' he says, adding that proper integration can take
years.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they get their computer systems right, most online
retailers are ill-prepared for the difficulties of handling
thousands or millions of small, frequent and individual orders. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (350-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 875) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Take toysmart.com, which is based in Massachusetts and is
majority-owned by Disney. The site specializes in ``good,''
educational toys _ no Barbies or Pokemons here _ and has built and
equipped a 150,000-square-foot warehouse in less than four months.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to its chaotic headquarters in Waltham trip over staff
and children strewn across the floor happily ``testing'' lego sets,
wooden trains and science kits (a favorite ``raises'' live
butterflies).
</P>
<P>
   Toysmart, which did more business in the first 30 hours of
December this year than in the whole of December 1998, is spending
more on its back office than most of its rivals, and has hired IT
and warehousing professionals from GTE and LL Bean.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it has had its glitches _ or ``gotchas'' as David
Lord, the chief executive, calls them. Some of these are easily put
right: the firm bought a new bank of printers to keep up with
demand for individual labels.
</P>
<P>
   More serious have been mismatches between stock on the Web site
and in the warehouse, because of delays in gaining approval for
credit cards and in checking handpicked orders.
</P>
<P>
   Clever electronics cannot solve every back-office glitch.
Although toysmart's warehouse is full of gleaming packing machines
and conveyor belts, there are no robots here. Every order is
assembled by hand using a system of codes that even an experienced
packer says takes ``ages'' to master.
</P>
<P>
   Pandesic's Hughes says that to meet the Christmas rush, many Web
retailers are employing ``tattooed musclemen'' to handle their
orders.
</P>
<P>
   Even toysmart's Lord is pressing his family, board directors and
local mothers to pick and wrap orders.
</P>
<P>
   One solution is to outsource everything from customer service to
fulfillment. iTurf's chief executive, Steve Kahn, calls this
``dancing with the devil.'' He describes the group's flirtation
with outsourcing as a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   There tends to be a conflict of interest, because the service
firm is trying to cut costs, whereas the online retailer wants
additional resources. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 350-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,350) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Handspring, which makes handheld computers, is paying the price.
Its customers are being billed several times, and many have been
unable to cancel orders.
</P>
<P>
   In the Christmas rush, sites are building incomplete systems.
Without tools for customizing pages, software that can identify
frequent customers or e-mail systems that help customers get quick
answers, sites will lose visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, once a system is in place, it is hard to slot in new
features. And that is the real lesson from all the bodging and
jerry-building.
</P>
<P>
   To succeed, online retailers need to construct more than just
bright Web sites made alluring by huge amounts of advertising. The
solution is to build top-notch distribution centers and warehouses.
But, as Amazon _ probably the best online retailer _ is
discovering, that is very expensive, indeed. &QL;

   Most shortcomings are to do with computers and therefore harder
to fix. Even the best sites, such as eBay, are prone to crash or

   Plenty of Internet retailers racing towards Christmas have had
neither the time nor the money to build systems that can cope with
huge, unpredictable surges in web traffic.
</P>
<P>
   However, the most gruelling struggle is to tie together old
computer systems so as to link their Web sites to data banks and
warehouses. Only then can firms know what is in stock, guarantee
delivery times and let customers track orders.

   ``Lack of technical experience will show how flaky many of these
companies are,'' he says, adding that proper integration can take
years.
</P>

   Take toysmart.com, which is based in Massachusetts and is

   Toysmart, which did more business in the first 30 hours of
December this year than in the whole of December 1998, is spending
more on its back office than most of its rivals, and has hired IT

</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it has had its glitches _ or ``gotchas'' as David
Lord, the chief executive, calls them. Some of these are easily put
right: the firm bought a new bank of printers to keep up with
demand for individual labels.
</P>
<P>
   More serious have been mismatches between stock on the Web site
and in the warehouse, because of delays in gaining approval for
credit cards and in checking handpicked orders.
</P>
<P>
   Clever electronics cannot solve every back-office glitch.
Although toysmart's warehouse is full of gleaming packing machines
and conveyor belts, there are no robots here. Every order is
assembled by hand using a system of codes that even an experienced
packer says takes ``ages'' to master.
</P>
<P>
   Pandesic's Hughes says that to meet the Christmas rush, many Web

</P>
<P>
   One solution is to outsource everything from customer service to

``dancing with the devil.'' He describes the group's flirtation

<P>
   In the Christmas rush, sites are building incomplete systems.
Without tools for customizing pages, software that can identify
frequent customers or e-mail systems that help customers get quick

 c.1999 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The shop is open, but you cannot get through the door
for the crowds flooding in from across the country. After you
finally squeeze inside, you have a question.
</P>
<P>
   A sales assistant asks you to write it down and tells you that
someone might reply _ after next Tuesday. You fill your shopping
basket anyway. At the till, however, the cashier removes several
items from your cart: ``Sorry, these are just for display. We are
sold out.''
</P>
<P>
   At home, you discover your credit card has been charged anyway _
twice, in fact. And, mysteriously, your bag contains things you
have never seen before.
</P>
<P>
   You go back to the store to complain. The sales assistant has no
memory of who you are or of what you bought. He suggests you
auction your unwanted purchases on eBay.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody would accept such treatment in a real shop. But Internet
shopping is blighted by overburdened Web sites without a precise
idea of their inventory, or of how to serve customers, or of when
deliveries will arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Last Christmas e-commerce was still a novelty, and customers
were willing to put up with all sorts of shortcomings. But with
sales expected to double to $6 billion this year, online shopping
is past being a prototype. Customers expect to be treated well.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has done everything in its power to raise their
expectations. The airwaves are echoing with jingles promising
perfect online shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Yet most online retailers are merely pretty facades. Their
priority is to create a buzz (what Web retailers dignify as ``brand
building'') so as to attract traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, only 5-20 percent of their investment goes on
merchandising, logistics and fulfillment, estimates Keng Lim, boss
of Escalate, which provides back-office systems for Internet
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Boo.com, a Swedish sports-fashion retailer, spent $100 million
on public relations and advertising before it had even freed its
Web site from bugs. Few Internet entrepreneurs have enough
retailing experience to build the logistics and customer management
that stand behind a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``God knows how often I have been in a room with a 27-year-old
guy who can dream up a fancy Web site, but hasn't a clue about the
complexities of the back office,'' scoffs Harold Hughes, of
Pandesic, which sells computer systems to Web merchants.
</P>
<P>
   This might seem hopelessly shortsighted. Yet, according to the
received wisdom of the Internet, building a business in such a
lopsided way might be the clever _ and possibly the only _ thing to
do.
</P>
<P>
   Most online retailers believe they are in a sprint to gain
market share over Christmas. Send.com, an upmarket gift site, has
spent $20 million on marketing in the past eight weeks _ five times
its original budget.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lannon, its chief executive, thinks the strategy is
sound: ``I look at this like an election campaign. If the election
is in December it doesn't make sense to say in January, I wish we
had spent more money.''
</P>
<P>
   Only the two or three firms with the largest sales in their
niche will be able to raise fresh money next year. The rest are
likely either to fail or to be bought.
</P>
<P>
   Perversely, even those that go bankrupt may succeed financially:
if a site has attracted a decent amount of traffic, a buyer may
think it worth enough to make its founders rich.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the approach is creating jerry-built companies.
PricewaterhouseCoopers, an accounting firm and consultancy, has
devised a measure of quality, called BetterWeb, which analyzes such
things as orders, returns and complaints.
</P>
<P>
   None of the 300 e-merchants it has surveyed passes muster.
Sometimes the lack of experience borders on naivete.
</P>
<P>
   Eve.com, a beauty-products site, tried to sell perfumes, only to
discover that these were classed as ``hazardous materials'' and
that to ship them via UPS required a license. That took months to
get.
</P>
<P>
   Most shortcomings are to do with computers and therefore harder
to fix. Even the best sites, such as eBay, are prone to crash or
are struggling to find skilled IT professionals.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Has the millennium bug been crushed?
</P>
<P>
   The world must wait until Jan. 1 to see if all of those Y2K
projects have done the trick. But the nerds seem to have persuaded
us that disruption will not be serious and on New Millennium's Day,
life will carry on.
</P>
<P>
   That emerges from the latest world poll, carried out by Angus
Reid for The Economist. The Canadian polling firm interviewed
representative adult samples in 21 countries from mid-November to
early December _ nearly 12,000 respondents in all.
</P>
<P>
   We asked our sample group if they thought the bug would cause
``serious and widespread economic disruption'' in their country, or
``some economic disruption, but not serious'' or ``little or no
disruption.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 7 percent, weighted by population, said they had never
heard of the bug.
</P>
<P>
   Though practically everyone knew about it in, say, America and
Hong Kong, 32 percent of Russians and 29 percent of Turks professed
total ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   Others had heard of it, but were unsure of its likely
consequences. Overall, this was true of 6 percent of our sample.
</P>
<P>
   What follows ignores such answers and concentrates on the rest.
Globally, only 8 percent of those who have an opinion expect
widespread disruption in their own countries. However, a further 41
percent expect some economic damage.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, those expecting some trouble and those expecting none
are evenly balanced.
</P>
<P>
   The share of pessimists varies greatly. In America and Canada,
only 2 percent expect really serious trouble, as do 4 percent in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   However, widespread disruption is expected by 10 percent of
French, 12 percent of Japanese and 14 percent of Turks.
</P>
<P>
   Southeast Asia is also worried. In South Korea and Japan,
roughly three-quarters of those expressing a view expect at least
some damage.
</P>
<P>
   For the purposes of planning, what matters is how people behave.
Will they refuse to fly? Will they refuse to buy? Might many
confine themselves to the safety of their own homes (if safe they
be)?
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the proportion saying that they will avoid nothing is a
high 68 percent. Again, the figure conceals large variations. For
example, 90 percent of Spaniards and 89 percent of Italians plan to
carry on as normal. By contrast, that is true of only 52 percent of
South Koreans, and 53 percent of Egyptians.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, some businesses are going to take a hit _
especially airlines. When asked if there was anything they would
avoid on millennium day, around a fifth of Americans and Canadians
volunteered that they would refuse to fly, despite their optimism
in this poll.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, very few Italians and no Spaniards would not fly.
</P>
<P>
   Very few people anywhere say they will not drive, use elevators,
or travel on trains and the underground.
</P>
<P>
   Our poll prompts one thought. The reaction against genetically
modified food has led to talk of a crisis of public confidence in
science. People are no longer, it is said, ready to trust the
experts when they assure the world.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for most people, the only reason to think that the bug is
safe is that experts say so. And, although events may prove the
scientists wrong, most people seem inclined to believe them.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently, people can still be persuaded by scientists, provided
it is done right. &QL;

   However, widespread disruption is expected by 10 percent of
French, 12 percent of Japanese and 14 percent of Turks.
</P>
<P>
   Southeast Asia is also worried. In South Korea and Japan,
roughly three-quarters of those expressing a view expect at least
some damage.
</P>
<P>
   For the purposes of planning, what matters is how people behave.
Will they refuse to fly? Will they refuse to buy? Might many
confine themselves to the safety of their own homes (if safe they
be)?
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the proportion saying that they will avoid nothing is a
high 68 percent. Again, the figure conceals large variations. For
example, 90 percent of Spaniards and 89 percent of Italians plan to
carry on as normal. By contrast, that is true of only 52 percent of
South Koreans, and 53 percent of Egyptians.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, some businesses are going to take a hit _
especially airlines. When asked if there was anything they would
avoid on millennium day, around a fifth of Americans and Canadians
volunteered that they would refuse to fly, despite their optimism
in this poll.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, very few Italians and no Spaniards would not fly.
</P>
<P>
   Very few people anywhere say they will not drive, use elevators,
or travel on trains and the underground.
</P>
<P>
   Our poll prompts one thought. The reaction against genetically
modified food has led to talk of a crisis of public confidence in
science. People are no longer, it is said, ready to trust the
experts when they assure the world.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for most people, the only reason to think that the bug is
safe is that experts say so. And, although events may prove the
scientists wrong, most people seem inclined to believe them.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently, people can still be persuaded by scientists, provided
it is done right. &QL;

<P>
   To assess a diabetic's risk of heart disease, a doctor typically
takes a blood sample to look for biochemical telltales such as the
level of insulin.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional method certainly does not involve sitting the
patient down on a psychiatrist's couch to see if a glass of water
looks half empty or half full.
</P>
<P>
   The latter technique may, however, turn out to be as much to the
point as blood tests, because some new research suggests that
depressed diabetics are, quite literally, prone to getting their
hearts broken.
</P>
<P>
   This study, which is to be published in January's
``Atherosclerosis'' by Trevor Orchard, an epidemiologist at the
University of Pittsburgh, is one piece of a mosaic that
psychologists and epidemiologists have been fitting together over
the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   Another piece is an answer to the question of why depressed
people seem particularly susceptible to infection.
</P>
<P>
   The picture that is emerging as the pieces fit together suggests
that the old tag ``a healthy mind in a healthy body'' frequently
needs to be inverted.
</P>
<P>
   An unhealthy mind can lead directly to an unhealthy body _ and
therefore another old medical tag ``treat the patient, not the
disease'' takes on a new significance.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Orchard explored this interaction between mind and body
using data collected during the Pittsburgh Epidemiology of Diabetes
Complications Study, which was designed to identify those factors
that worsen the health of people already suffering from diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   In ``juvenile-onset'' (type-I) diabetes, these complications can
be as deadly as the ailment itself. Type-I diabetics cannot produce
insulin _ a hormone which regulates the level of sugar in the
blood. They must therefore inject themselves with insulin at
regular intervals or else risk coma or sudden death.
</P>
<P>
   And, as if this were not sobering enough, type-I diabetics also
have a tendency to suffer from early and severe arteriosclerosis, a
condition in which the walls of the blood vessels thicken and
harden.
</P>
<P>
   Arteriosclerosis of the coronary arteries is particularly
dangerous, for these vessels supply blood to the muscle of the
heart. As the coronary-artery walls narrow, the flow of nutrients
and oxygen to the heart slows, and coronary heart disease (CHD)
follows.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Orchard's analysis involved more than 600 diabetics, who
were examined at two-year intervals over six years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to undergoing the usual physiological tests, the
participants were also evaluated at the beginning of the study by
the ``Beck Depression Inventory.'' This test rates individual
symptoms of depression (such as pessimism, suicidal ideas, social
withdrawal and loss of libido).
</P>
<P>
   The more depressed a patient is, the more points he accumulates.
A patient's score on the Beck scale turned out to be a good
predictor of his eventual level of CHD _ better, indeed, than high
levels of blood sugar, the standard symptom of diabetic disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Those without CHD scored significantly lower than those with it.
And patients who developed angina, a painful heart condition
resulting from arteriosclerosis, had depression scores that were
nearly twice as high (12.2) as diabetics whose hearts stayed
healthy (6.6).
</P>
<P>
   Diabetics, of course, whether depressed or not, are seriously
ill people. But it has been known for a long time that people with
no serious illness other than depression are more likely to die
than those who are otherwise similar, but mentally healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Many of their causes of death have some visible connection with
their disease _ suicide, violent accidents and drug abuse are high
on the list. But depressed patients also die more often than the
mentally healthy from ``natural'' causes such as pneumonia and
influenza. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 600, OR CONTINUE TO 1,000) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   The question of why severely depressed patients suffer from
infections more often than the average person attracted the
attention of Gregory Miller, a psychologist at Carnegie Mellon
University, also in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   In a normal body, infectious organisms are met by a battalion of
cells known as lymphocytes. Some of these attack the invaders
directly. Others produce antibodies that gum them up. But the
immune systems of the severely depressed tend to mount a weaker
counterattack than those of the mentally fit.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Miller and his colleagues think they have the explanation
for this immunological apathy. In the past, studies relating mental
depression to depression of the immune system have usually been
performed on patients stuck in hospital. This complicates matters,
because the mere fact of being in a hospital affects a patient's
mood and behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Dr. Miller studied 32 depressed women who were not in
hospital, and matched them with a control group of healthy women.
As he reports in the latest issue of ``Psychosomatic Medicine,''
lymphocytes from the depressed women responded much less than those
from the normal women when exposed to agents that induce
proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   One explanation for this relies on the observation that
depression is often accompanied by a hormonal imbalance in the
brain. The disease is associated with abnormal levels of
norepinephrine and estradiol, hormones that are known to help
regulate the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Miller's results, however, showed that this biochemical
difference could not, by itself, account for the weakness of the
responses shown to infection by the depressed women. There must be
something else involved.
</P>
<P>
   When he and his colleagues started examining the women in
question, they found that the depressed subjects had very different
ways of life from the controls. They smoked more, drank more
caffeinated drinks, slept more fitfully, and exercised less.
</P>
<P>
   But, perhaps surprisingly, only one of these differences, that
in physical activity, proved to have a significant relationship
with lymphocyte production. Dr. Miller found that physical activity
accounted for about half of the difference in immunity between
depressed and normal women.
</P>
<P>
   He believes that exercise represents the first clear behavioral
link between depression and a dysfunctional immune system.
</P>
<P>
   If that speculation proves correct, encouraging depressed people
to exercise should help to protect them from illness _ and the
strange correlations between depression, pneumonia and influenza
may finally make some sense. &QL;

   YEAR-AD-COLUMN (Undated) _ The frenzy over advertising for

pitch'' in 1999. Alas, the frantic efforts to get consumers to

season Amazon.com, with its obsession with serving customers, is
singing Fred Reichheld's song. By Fred Andrews.

   Food and dining stories from The N.Y. Times News Service for
Wednesday, Dec. 29:
</P>
<P>
   MILLENNIUM-DINNERS (Undated) _ Only rarely does food break
through to history's front page, but through the current
millennium, it has been the pivot point for encounters and events _
some actual, some fictional _ that have resonated down the
corridors of time. Not many people can explain the causes of the
Franco-Prussian War, but nearly everyone feels the power of
Proust's madeleine. The economics of the Plymouth colony feel
remote, but the great dinner that became Thanksgiving lives on, a
central fact of American life. It would be foolish to try to name
the greatest meals of the last thousand years. The historical
record is too spotty. But it is possible to isolate a dozen moments
that, for various reasons, still grip the imagination, define the
human experience or seem, in retrospect, brimming with implication
for the future. By William Grimes. (2300 words)
</P>
<P>
   WINE-TALK (New York) _ Everyone knows there is a terrible
shortage of Champagne what with the Millennium and all, but here
was Piper-Heidseick Brut, regularly $20.99, now $19.99, and Henri
Abele' Brut, regularly $17.99, now $14.99. Retailers were sobbing
into their Evian six months ago at the prospect of having to
disappoint so many loyal Champagne customers at the year's end. And
now, two days before the eve, Abele' Brut is selling for less than
some bottles of Beaujolais. All those doomsayers have helped build
a banner year for Champagne. By Frank J. Prial.

   CENSUS _ WASHINGTON _ The Census Bureau on Wednesday will
release new estimates showing sharp population increases in Texas
and Florida. The estimates, for the year ending July 1, show Texas
topping 20 million and Florida surpassing 15 million. It places
both of them among the fastest growing states in the country.
Georgia, with a 2 percent single year population increase, is
identified as the fastest-growing state in the South. (Dart, Cox

   CENSUS-OHIO _ WASHINGTON _ Ohio's population grew a paltry .2
percent last year as 32,671 more people moved to other states than
moved in, the Census Bureau will report Wednesday. The growth was
due to births. (Dart, Cox News Service). 20.
</P>
<P>
   CENSUS-FLA29 _ WASHINGTON _ More people died in Florida last
year than in any other state except California, the Census Bureau
will report Wednesday. Despite these 159,752 obituaries, however,
Florida's population surged to over 15 million as new residents
poured in from other states and foreign countries and the state's
birth rate was even more robust than its death rate. The Census
Bureau report covers demographic changes from July 1, 1998 to July
1, 1999, and shows Florida ranking behind only California, Texas
and New York in population. (Dart, Cox News Service). 20.

   MCCAIN-WEB _ In the first use of on-line ads by a presidential
candidate, John McCain used banner ads to help generate 10,000
signatures he needed to get on the Virginia ballot. And the McCain
campaign says it is hoping the Internet will help it make the most
of any bounce it would receive should it win the New Hampshire
primary. (Sherman, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 25.

</P>
<P>
   MAC-FLAW _Someone may have the means to clog the high-speed
lines used by a select group of targets, using a flaw in the latest
Macintosh operating system, according to John Copeland, a Georgia
Tech professor. Copeland, director of a center that studies
high-speed data, says someone has been scanning computers from afar
via the Internet, apparently looking for Macs with the OS 9 system.
The Mac flaw would permit a distant hacker to trigger a flood of
data to be released and sent to a designated target. If enough
computers were sending data _ about 40 _ they could flood even a
high-speed line and close down an organization's Internet access.

   CENSUS-GEORGIA _ ATLANTA _ Georgia led the South in population
growth in the last year and was fourth in the nation, according to
a Census Bureau report to be released Wednesday. Georgia's
population increased 2 percent to nearly 7.8 million for the year
ending July 1, 1999, and it was fourth in the nation in attracting
people from other states (a 1 percent growth rate). Generally, the
South ranked second to the West in growth. (Cook, Atlanta

<P>
   MILLENNIUM-DINNERS (Undated) _ Only rarely does food break
through to history's front page, but through the current
millennium, it has been the pivot point for encounters and events _
some actual, some fictional _ that have resonated down the
corridors of time. Not many people can explain the causes of the
Franco-Prussian War, but nearly everyone feels the power of
Proust's madeleine. The economics of the Plymouth colony feel
remote, but the great dinner that became Thanksgiving lives on, a
central fact of American life. It would be foolish to try to name
the greatest meals of the last thousand years. The historical
record is too spotty. But it is possible to isolate a dozen moments
that, for various reasons, still grip the imagination, define the
human experience or seem, in retrospect, brimming with implication
for the future. By William Grimes. (2300 words)

<P>
   WINE-TALK (New York) _ Everyone knows there is a terrible
shortage of Champagne what with the Millennium and all, but here
was Piper-Heidseick Brut, regularly $20.99, now $19.99, and Henri
Abele' Brut, regularly $17.99, now $14.99. Retailers were sobbing
into their Evian six months ago at the prospect of having to
disappoint so many loyal Champagne customers at the year's end. And
now, two days before the eve, Abele' Brut is selling for less than
some bottles of Beaujolais. All those doomsayers have helped build
a banner year for Champagne. By Frank J. Prial.

MIRANDA MUST STAND DESPITE ATTEMPT TO WEAKEN IT 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the 
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is
levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.) 
(gm) 
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   c. 1999 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune  
``Miranda rights,'' a pundit said years ago, ``mean the police have
to use their wits and not their fists to solve a crime.'' It was
true in 1966 when the U.S. Supreme Court outlined Miranda rights in
the Miranda vs. Arizona decision, and it's true today.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now, however, a February 1999 decision out of the U.S. Fourth
Circuit Court of Appeals (United States vs. Dickerson) jeopardizes
our Miranda rights. The U.S. Supreme Court has accepted the case on
appeal. It will be argued before the high court early in the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Television cop shows have familiarized the general public about
Miranda rights and the warning that officers of the law are
required to give those in custody the police want to interrogate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and
will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to
speak to an attorney and have an attorney present during
questioning. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided
for you at government expense.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Dickerson case, the appeals court in a 2-1 ruling decided
that it didn't matter whether Charles Thomas Dickerson confessed
before or after he was read his Miranda rights _ the confession is
admissible evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court sent the case back down to the trial judge for
further proceeding. There had been a dispute about the timing of
the Miranda warning and the record wasn't clear on whether the
police had given Dickerson the warning before or after he confessed
to aiding in a bank robbery.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the appellate court, using a controversial statute
passed by Congress in June 1968, nullified the Miranda warning. The
statute (Title 18, Section 3501 of the U.S. Code) allows the trial
judge to determine whether a confession was voluntary or not.
</P>
<P>
   The Section 3501 statute requires a trial judge to consider the
time span after an arrest that a confession was made, whether the
defendant was advised that he was not required to make such a
statement and whether the defendant was advised of the right to
counsel prior to questioning. The judge, however, can ignore any of
this information in ruling a confession voluntary. In other words,
a trial judge may ignore a defendant's rights protected by the
Miranda warning.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno sent a letter to Congress in
September 1997 in which she stated that the Section 3501 statute is
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Reno isn't the only attorney general to question the
constitutionality of the statute. In the 31 years since it was
passed and signed into law, no federal or state prosecutor has used
the statute to override Miranda.
</P>
<P>
   There are two startling irregularities in the Fourth Circuit
Court of Appeals decision to ignore Miranda.
</P>
<P>
   If the congressional statute is used, the trial judge is the one
who makes the determination as to whether a confession was
voluntary. In the Dickerson case, the trial judge ruled that
Dickerson's confession was not voluntary _ using the same
considerations provided both by the statute and by Miranda. But the
appellate court overruled the trial court. Usually an appeals court
defers to a trial court judge's determination of the facts of a
case.
</P>
<P>
   The second irregularity: Neither the federal prosecutor nor the
defense attorney raised the issue of the Section 3501 statute. It
was raised in an amicus brief, by a University of Utah professor
who wants Miranda overturned. And neither the defense nor the
prosecution had an opportunity to rebut the argument raised in the
amicus brief.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the appeals court decided to use this case and the
Section 3501 statute to overrule a significant constitutional
protection for all criminal defendants _ our Miranda rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals overstepped its judicial
bounds to strike down Miranda.
</P>
<P>
   Miranda rights flow directly out of the Fifth Amendment's
prohibition: ``No person ... shall be compelled in any criminal
case to be a witness against himself.'' The Miranda warning merely
informs a defendant of his right to remain silent in face of police
interrogation.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court's Miranda vs. Arizona decision calls
Miranda rights ``constitutional standards for protection of the
privilege against self-incrimination.'' The courts have called the
Fifth Amendment's prohibition against compulsory self-incrimination
a ``privilege''; in reality, it is a constitutional right.
</P>
<P>
   The Miranda decision later states: ``to respect the
inviolability of the human personality, our accusatory system of
criminal justice demands that the government seeking to punish an
individual produce the evidence against him by its own independent
labors, rather than by the cruel, simple expedient of compelling it
from his own mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   The high court recognizes that the Fifth Amendment is
``fundamental to our system of constitutional rule.'' It outlined
the Miranda warning to protect the right not to be forced to
incriminate oneself.
</P>
<P>
   In his Pulitzer Prize winning book, ``Origins of the Fifth
Amendment,'' the pre-eminent constitutional scholar Leonard W. Levy
traces the origins of the prohibition against compelled
self-incrimination to 12th century England and the human need for
freedom of belief, speech and conscience. ``It was, in its origins,
unquestionably the invention of those who were guilty of religious
crimes, like heresy, schism, and nonconformity, and, later, of
political crimes like treason, seditious libel, and breach of
parliamentary privilege _ more often than not, the offense was
merely criticism of the government, its policies, or its officers.
... In the broadest sense it was a protection not of the guilty, or
of the innocent, but of freedom of expression, of political
liberty, of the right to worship as one pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has erected constitutional standards to
protect other rights. It created the Lemon three-prong test to
evaluate whether a government action or law violates the
Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. It created the
three-prong Miller test so a court could evaluate whether a book or
movie or other materials are obscene and thereby not protected by
the free speech and free press clauses of the First Amendment.
Those constitutional standards flow out of the high court's
interpretation of the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Those constitutional standards trump any statutory law.
Certainly, the court's ``constitutional standards for protection of
the privilege against self-incrimination'' also remain above
statutory law.
</P>
<P>
   The high court recognized in its Miranda decision that ``an
interrogation environment is created for no purpose other than to
subjugate the individual to the will of the examiner. This
atmosphere carries its own badge of intimidation.'' The Miranda
warning simply gives a defendant the psychological leverage to
stand mute instead of being badgered into a false confession _
unless he or she wishes to confess.
</P>
<P>
   Justice is better served when a confession is voluntary and not
one forced by intimidation or physical abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court should confirm that the Miranda warning
remains the constitutional standard that protects our Fifth
Amendment right against compulsory self-incrimination. The Section
3501 statute is too weak to protect that right.
</P>
<P>
   The self-incrimination clause of the Fifth Amendment is the
bulwark of a free people against abuse of police power. It must be
secure.

<P>
   Too much champagne, booze or wine is a holiday tradition that
promises to be more excessive this New Year's Eve as people party _
as the Artist Formerly Known as Prince ng _ ``like it's
1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Medically speaking, all that revelry is going to do a number on
people's brains.
</P>
<P>
   Overindulging in alcoholic beverages causes blood vessels to
swell or dilate, which triggers headache pain, according to the
National Headache Foundation in San Francisco. Alcohol also acts as
a diuretic, which leads to dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   There's no quick fix for a bad hangover, but here are a few tips
on how to ease the suffering, courtesy of the NHF:
</P>
<P>
   _ Drink fluids containing minerals and salts: Drinks and broths
rich is minerals and salts relieve dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   _ Eat some honey before and/or after drinking. Honey supplies
fructose, a natural form of sugar, that helps metabolize the
alcohol and ease hangover symptoms. Tomato juice, another good
source of fructose, also helps cure a hangover.
</P>
<P>
   _ Drink coffee. Caffeine constricts swollen blood vessels, which
should provide some pain relief.
</P>
<P>
   _ Finally, a word of caution. While the alcohol is still in your
system, go easy on over-the-counter pain relievers, especially
acetaminophen _ the main ingredient in Tylenol _ which can cause
liver damage in some people when combined with alcohol.

SIMPLE PLEASURES TO BE FOUND AROUND HERE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JEANNIE KEVER 
c.1999 Houston Chronic
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRAZOSPORT, Texas _ A true beach town should meet certain
requirements: It has to be on the coast, of course, filled with
fading motels and sandy-floored restaurants dishing up heaping
platters of fried food.
</P>
<P>
   It should be small and unsophisticated, home to video stores
rather than opera houses and to a citizenry better acquainted with
Evinrude than with Evian.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby entertainment should be interesting but not so engrossing
that it takes up your entire day. If it's not free, it should be
cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Brazosport qualifies.
</P>
<P>
   Brazosport isn't actually a town, a fact that has befuddled
newcomers forever. It's more of a step back in time, a collection
of nine towns scattershot along the Brazos River as it rushes into
the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Brazoria. Clute. Freeport. Jones Creek. Lake Jackson. Oyster
Creek. Quintana. Richwood. Surfside Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Chemical plants battle with beaches for the area's identity. Dow
Chemical Co.'s Freeport plant employs 5,000 people to make plastics
and chemicals; it is the company's largest plant and Brazosport's
largest employer.
</P>
<P>
   But close your eyes to the acres of chemical factories with
steam and smoke belching from their labyrinthine pipes. Ignore the
Wal-Mart and golden arches and other signs of economic hubris that
define Lake Jackson and the resulting commercial decline in
Freeport and surrounding cities.
</P>
<P>
   There are simple pleasures to be found here, an hour's drive
from downtown Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Shoot down Texas 288, the Nolan Ryan Expressway, and feel
big-city hassles _ by which we mean big-city traffic _ disappear.
You're in the country before you hit Beltway 8; another half-hour,
and the oak trees grow thicker and the road begins to undulate with
modest hills.
</P>
<P>
   Slide off 288 into Lake Jackson, home of Brazosport's only
shopping mall, its discount superstores and fast-food restaurants,
its college campus and strip shopping centers.
</P>
<P>
   With 25,000 residents, Lake Jackson is the undisputed population
hub, site of most of what passes for a major tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
   It even has a museum that serves as a monument to itself.
</P>
<P>
   The Lake Jackson Historical Museum, which opened last year,
explores four aspects of the region's history: prehistoric,
plantation, petrochemical and present-day.
</P>
<P>
   The antebellum era is recounted by a ghostlike vision of Abner
Jackson speaking on the front porch of his plantation home. The
plantation's ruins are just a few miles away, open to the public on
the first Saturday of each month.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Chemical looms large in the museum _ Lake Jackson was
literally designed, right down to its street names, by Alden Dow,
the architect son of Dow Chemical founder Herbert Dow.
</P>
<P>
   The chemical plants are a flashpoint in Brazosport _ they
spawned the area's lingering reputation for foul air and pollution,
but they also represent middle-class paychecks for many Brazosport
families.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Chemical plays the role of corporate citizen, too, working
with the Coast Conservation Association and Texas Parks and
Wildlife Department to create a 75-acre marine-life education
center and fish hatchery in Lake Jackson, named Sea Center Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A visitor center has a 24-foot long touch tank stocked with blue
crabs, hermit crabs, urchins, snails and other sea life for
visitors willing to risk a pinch from a quick-moving crab claw.
</P>
<P>
   Aquariums showcase watery wildlife, from bay dwellers such as
red drums and spotted sea trout to tarpons, pompano, yellow-fin
tuna and sharks.
</P>
<P>
   The visitor center is open daily except Mondays; tours of the
hatchery, which has produced about 50 million red drum fingerlings
for release into Gulf bays and estuaries, must be arranged in
advance.
</P>
<P>
   Nature is also center stage at the Brazosport Museum of Natural
Science, part of the Center for Arts and Sciences on the Brazosport
College campus.
</P>
<P>
   The small museum has a metal casting of allosaurus bones, hoo the dinosaur rage, as well as the skulls of a black rhino and an
elephant. Its fossil collection includes a dinosaur egg.
</P>
<P>
   It has arrowheads and minerals, stuffed birds and a dead
armadillo. More than 14,000 shells are on display or lined up in
drawers under the glass exhibit cases.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lake Jackson and surrounding communities are young
upstarts with industrial roots _ Freeport sprang up in 1912 to
serve the Freeport Sulphur Co., and Lake Jackson was created in
1945 as a company town for Dow Chemical _ the meandering Brazos
River has been an important waterway in southeast Texas for
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca cruised its curving shores in
the 16th century, and settlers of Stephen F. Austin's colony
arrived at the mouth of the Brazos in 1821. Just a few decades ago,
Freeport was a bustling port town.
</P>
<P>
   Little evidence remains of that legacy. Lake Jackson may be a
city on the make, but Freeport, Quintana, Surfside Beach and the
other communities exude a sense of years passed and a future on
hold. They represent challenges for civic boosters, who have
responded with beautification programs, economic incentives for
business investment and public funding for resuscitation efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Gentrification is discussed in the future tense, but for
visitors, that holds a certain charm.
</P>
<P>
   An unprotected left turn is still a snap.
</P>
<P>
   So give it a try off 288 and cruise down Freeport's West Second
Street. The Old Brazos River snakes along here, cutting up from the
Freeport Harbor Channel, almost hidden behind a berm. Climb up to
inspect the docked fishing boats.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there is the main event: the beaches.
</P>
<P>
   Many allow you to drive on the sand, and most people do. A
blaring stereo is technically optional, but summer crusaders
generally indulge.
</P>
<P>
   After Labor Daver, the crowds dwindle. On an autumn day
still warm enough for swimming, you may have a stretch of sand all
to yourself.
</P>
<P>
   The harbor channel divides Quintana from Surfside Beach. It's
flanked by two jetties that serve as free fishing piers. Nearby
shelling is good, too.
</P>
<P>
   South of the channel, Quintana Beach County Park offers
restrooms, vending machines, showers and thatch-covered picnic
tables. Beyond it lies the remote Bryan Beach State Recreation
Area.
</P>
<P>
   The estuaries lacing Surfside Beach, north of the channel, are
peopled with sun-browned men fishing for the dinner they will later
take home down streets named Pompano, Shark and Oyster.
</P>
<P>
   These beaches are Spartan, furnished only with picnic tables and
chemical toilets, crisscrossed with tire tracks.
</P>
<P>
   There is no glamour in Brazosport. There are no four-star
restaurants or glittering nightclubs, no awe-inspiring museums or
catch-your-breath amusement parks.
</P>
<P>
   It is, instead, a place for those in search of winding two-lane
roads and shell-strewn beaches, small-town attractions and heaping
platters of fried food.
</P>

SAM HOUSTON COUNTRY STEEPED IN HISTORY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Photo available on NYT database) 
 
By JEANNIE KEVER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas _ He winks from among the trees, looming large
over Interstate 45, a ghost beckoning you to the past.
</P>
<P>
   Today Sam Houston's town is inextricably linked in the public
mind with crime and punishment: Huntsville has the state's highest
concentration of prisons and hosts its frequent executions.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism promoters don't hide that _ they happily provide
directions to all eight prisons and hand out detailed maps of the
Walls, the state's oldest prison, just blocks from the town square.
You can even check out Old Sparky, the state's original electric
chair, agent of death for 361 inmates.
</P>
<P>
   That gritty reality stands in pointed contrast to Huntsville
State Park and Sam Houston National Forest, with their homespun
entertainments of horseback riding, canoeing and fishing.
</P>
<P>
   But it is statesman Sam Houston, all 67 feet of him, who greets
people hurtling up I-45 from Houston, 70 miles to the south.
</P>
<P>
   The highway signs say simply ``Statue.''
</P>
<P>
   And, really, what more is there to say about this 60-ton
steel-and-concrete monument to Huntsville's most famous citizen,
the man who led the fight for Texas' independence, became president
of the fledgling country, then served as a U.S. senator and
governor after Texas became a state?
</P>
<P>
   There it is, the creation of sculptor David Adickes, unveiled in
1994 and visible for six miles. Houston, who stood a lofty 6 feet 6
inches in life, stares straight ahead, one hand on his hip, the
other resting atop a walking stick.
</P>
<P>
   Grab your camera and join the other tourists trying to figure
out how to photograph something so unwieldy. Then drop by the
visitor center for a map of the city and a handful of brochures
detailing other activities.
</P>
<P>
   Turn left on U.S. 75 and head into town.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few miles, you're back in Sam's country.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Houston State University is on your right, a 12,000-student
institution founded in 1879 and known for its criminal-justice
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street is the Sam Houston Memorial Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Its grounds include two of Houston's homes, refurbished to give
visitors a peek at life 150 years ago. The kitchen garden has been
replanted. Explanatory narratives are available with the push of a
button at various points.
</P>
<P>
   Houston lived at the Woodlands home with his wife and six
children; the Steamboat home, where he died of pneumonia in 1863,
was later moved here.
</P>
<P>
   Houston had chosen his grave site, in a corner of Oakwood
Cemetery, just northeast of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest marker in this wooded cemetery dates to 1842, a
time when cemeteries _ like the rest of life _ were racially
segregated.
</P>
<P>
   A walking tour offers a brief history lesson.
</P>
<P>
   In death, Houston is surrounded by some of his closest friends
in life _ Thomas Gibbs, Thomas Carothers, J. Carol Smith and
Anthony Branch.
</P>
<P>
   His widow, Margaret Lea Houston, died in Washington County four
years later and was buried there.
</P>
<P>
   Oakwood Cemetery is a mix of grand and small monuments, the
famous and the unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Slaves are buried in unmarked graves next to some of
Huntsville's prominent black citizens. Samuel Walker Houston, whose
father was one of Sam Houston's slaves, was publisher of the
Huntsville Times and principal of Huntsville's first high school
for black students.
</P>
<P>
   He died in 1945; the Samuel Walker Houston Cultural Center, a
museum of black life in Huntsville after the Civil War, opened in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown Huntsville is a work in progress around the Walker
County Courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Murals by Richard Haas give plain walls the illusion of carved
stone. Shops sell everything from antiques to Beanie Babies. One
block over, the 1862 Gibbs-Powell House is an example of classicRevival architecture and serves as a historical museum.
</P>
<P>
   History of a grimmer sort is dished up at the Texas Prison
Museum on the south side of the square. The museum portrays prison
life as Spartan and sometimes dangerous, but not brutal.
</P>
<P>
   One showcase displays weapons that inmates fashioned from
utensils, toilet-tank hardware and anything else they could
scrounge.
</P>
<P>
   The famous and infamous who have done time in Huntsville also
get their share of attention, including Kiowa chief Santana,
stripper Candy Barr and blues man Leadbelly, whose real name was
Huddie Ledbetter and who was convicted of murder in 1918, sentenced
to 30 years in prison and later pardoned.
</P>
<P>
   Curious about what it would feel like to hear a cell door clang
shut? Check out the claustrophobic 9-foot-by-6-foot cell with its
two bunks, stainless-steel wash basin and toilet.
</P>
<P>
   Old Sparky, a polished wood chair built by an inmate and
equipped with leather restraining straps, sits in an alcove removed
from the rest of the museum, out of reach behind a plastic window.
The state's original electric chair was retired in 1964 and
replaced by lethal injection when executions were resumed in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   The museum is staffed by volunteers who field tourists'
questions and even the occasional telephone call from relatives
curious about an inmate's parole date. (Callers are advised to
contact the parole board.)
</P>
<P>
   Neida Lopez, a senior fashion-merchandising major at Sam Houston
State, was at the museum earlier this fall with her parents, who
were visiting from Rio Grande City.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very interesting,'' she said. ``And amazing, what goes on
behind the walls that we really don't know about.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost 14,000 inmates are imprisoned in Walker County, and more
than 7,000 area residents work for the prison system. But Lopez
said she never thinks about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think about the prisons. I don't think about inmates
escaping. ... The walls on campus are the only walls I think
about.''
</P>
<P>
   But when most people in Huntsville talk about the Walls, they
are referring to the state's first permanent penitentiary,
established in 1849 and still home to 1,700 inmates.
</P>
<P>
   The prison's high red-brick walls just east of downtown are
topped with a chain-link fence and razor wire. Armed guards watch
from high-rise security posts.
</P>
<P>
   Passers-by can sometimes glimpse life at other prisons if they
drive past while inmates are working outside.
</P>
<P>
   South of town, life takes on a decidedly more relaxing tone at
Huntsville State Park.
</P>
<P>
   The 2,083-acre park is a gem of Piney Woods and sloping hills,
narrow roads crowded with bicycles and pickup trucks, a creek-fed
lake popular with fishermen, swimmers and boaters. Canoes and
paddle boats are available for rent.
</P>
<P>
   Guided trail rides at Lake Raven Stables give city slickers a
chance to earn some saddle sores.
</P>
<P>
   The horses are so familiar with the one-hour ride through
densely shaded woods that the rider's equestrian skill is beside
the point. Kids younger than 6 can ride with an adult, and
early-morning and late-afternoon rides often yield deer sightings.
</P>
<P>
   The horses may be a bit bored _ the guides, too _ but the riders
aren't.
</P>
<P>
   Thus invigorated, it's time to head home, giving old Sam one
last glance in the rearview mirror.

NATURE'S HEAVEN JUST A FEW MILES UP THE ROAD FROM HOUSTON 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle

<P>
   BIG THICKET NATIONAL PRESERVE _ Spider webs lace the trails.
It's a harmless enough evocation of nature. But then park ranger
Merle King begins to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have mountain lions. You probably won't see any, and
they'll probably run away from you, but you may need to look big.''
He demonstrates, windmilling his arms in ``get away'' fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have feral pigs. They'll probably run away from you,
unless you get between a sow and her piglets. Then you might need
to shinny up a tree until they go away.''
</P>
<P>
   You're how far from Houston, where the wild hogs drive SUVs and
shinnying up a tree could get you in serious trouble? Call it 120
miles and another biosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Thicket is 86,000 acres of forest, meadow and swamp
scattered across 12 parcels of land and water just north of
Beaumont.
</P>
<P>
   It's wilderness incarnate. No camper hookups. No snack bars. No
plastic-glass shields separating human from beast.
</P>
<P>
   Just you and the elements. Fifty-five inches of rain in an
average year.
</P>
<P>
   Steamy summers, chilly and overcast winters, the occasional
flash of heaven in spring and fall.
</P>
<P>
   Mosquitoes almost year-round.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Thicket is not your stereotypical tourist attraction,
but the 65,000 people who visit each year find an enveloping
solitude and a biological diversity unmatched in North America.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't so much the number of plants and animals here that
inspired Congress to create the nature preserve in 1974. Other
places have more wildlife or rarer specimens.
</P>
<P>
   What draws attention is the diversity that nature offers _
roadrunners zipping past flowering dogwood, armadillos sharing
space with great blue herons.
</P>
<P>
   Southeastern swamps collide with Eastern hardwood forests,
Midwestern plains and Southwestern deserts. Bogs abut sandhills.
</P>
<P>
   This confluence of environments is attributed to the ice age,
when glaciers pushed many species southward. When the glaciers
retreated, some of the immigrants remained in this new land.
</P>
<P>
   The Alabama and Coushatta Indians hunted along the edges of the
Big Thicket, but the area was essentially uncharted when white
settlers arrived in the 1800s. Logging of pine and cypress trees
sped the encroachment, and nearby oil strikes at the turn of the
century further hastened development.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that development involved a railroad line, long since
torn out. But its legacy is an integral component of the woods'
eerie atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Bragg Road, a narrow Piney Woods road linking FM 787 and FM 1293
northwest of Saratoga, is ground zero for the spooky stories.
</P>
<P>
   For decades visitors have insisted that a floating ball of light
haunts the road, a mystery featured in National Geographic magazine
and on Japanese television.
</P>
<P>
   Legend claims the light is from a lantern carried by the ghost
of a railroad man beheaded in an accident. Skeptics call it swamp
gas or the refraction of headlights from the highway at the end of
Bragg Road.
</P>
<P>
   Believe what you will, and step into the dense underbrush, where
the soft ``slap-slap-slap'' of oars sluicing through muddy
waterways is punctuated only by the buzz of insects and the calls
that draw thousands of birders to witness the migrations each
spring and fall.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with a Texas fishing license may try the creeks, small
lakes and rivers in the Big Thicket. Hunting is allowed on about
half of the preserve.
</P>
<P>
   But most people headed for the Big Thicket limit their
interactions with the natives to the visual, packing binoculars and
insect repellent rather than rifles and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Canoeing allows you to lose yourself, far from roads and even
from the trails that traverse the land. Five outfitters rent canoes
and kayaks in the area, steering people most often to Village Creek
or the Neches River.
</P>
<P>
   The most ambitious trips take several days. Easier outings can
be completed in a few hours' paddling and drifting on Village
Creek, which begins near the Alabama and Coushatta Indian
Reservation and joins the Neches 60 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   On weekdays you may have the water to yourself, accompanied only
by the bluegills and bass swimming below and the crows, cardinals,
herons, kingfishers and pileated woodpeckers on the banks and
overhead.
</P>
<P>
   The tea-colored water _ it takes its hue from the tannin
released by plants below the surface _ moves slowly except after
the occasional flood, making it comfortable for beginners. Frequent
sandbars provide convenient stopping places for picnics or to
absorb the otherworldliness of the junglelike surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   Several outfitters provide delivery and pickup service, making
it easy to drift and float without worrying about logistics. Just
remember where to get out.
</P>
<P>
   Landlubbers may prefer to hoof it.
</P>
<P>
   There are 45 miles of trails in four units, ranging from two
half-mile trails to an 18-mile loop trail in the Big Sandy Creek
Unit, the only trail open to horses and all-terrain bicycles. All
others are for hikers only.
</P>
<P>
   The Pitcher Plant Trail and the Sundew Nature Trail are
accessible by wheelchair. The former is named for a carnivorous
plant that grows in the preserve; it and three other carnivorous
plants flourish along the Sundew trail.
</P>
<P>
   But plants, even the meat-eating variety, aren't the excitement
most hikers crave.
</P>
<P>
   Birding is a major draw, but other wildlife can be eye-catching,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors' sightings, posted outside the information center just
north of Kountze, reveal the presence of deer, coral snakes,
woodpeckers and, indeed, feral pigs.
</P>
<P>
   That, coupled with King's warnings, is enough to add a sense of
foreboding to the sound of unseen critters crashing through the
brush, and relief when the flash of a white-tipped tail reveals a
deer dashing from the trail.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Kirby Nature Trail, an easy hike through Southern
magnolia, loblolly pine, basket oak, black cherry and Spanish red
oak just behind the visitor center, has an air of mystery.
</P>
<P>
   The trail meanders through the Village Creek floodplain, at one
point skirting the creek and the steel-and-wood bridge that spans
it.
</P>
<P>
   The creek is shallow and muddy after the summer drought, and
buried logs emerge like some ancient species of alligator. Ferns
grow wild along mossy tree limbs, and tiny toads, butterflies and
grasshoppers skitter away at the sound of something larger moving
just out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   It is dark and primal, sunlight only occasionally breaking

   CHAPPELL HILL, Texas _ It's dark inside.
</P>
<P>
   A buffalo peers from one wall, a veritable herd of deer from the
opposite.
</P>
<P>
   You sniff, trying to identify the blend of roasted bean and
dried leaf that permeates the air. The plaque outside identifies
the building as being on the National Register of Historic Places,
but the only sound is the clicking of a computer keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   The Texana Cigar &AMP; Coffee Co. is open for business in courtly
Chappell Hill, a distinctly trendy enterprise in a
turn-of-the-century setting.
</P>
<P>
   Such eclecticism characterizes all of Washington County, a taste
of the Texas Hill Country just 75 miles northwest of Houston on
U.S. 290, free of the overdressed charm of better-known towns
farther west.
</P>
<P>
   People know Washington County for its wildflowers _ tens of
thousands of tourists arrive each spring, dropping money like so
many empty Kodak boxes _ and for its pivotal role in Texas history.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Declaration of Independence was signed in the town of
Washington in 1836, formally severing ties with Mexico and ushering
in the brief period when Texas was a sovereign nation.
</P>
<P>
   But there is more to the area, more even _ sacrilege! _ than
Blue Bell ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors prowl antiques shops and hug miniature horses, picnic
high above the Brazos River and dine in elegant surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   The county's twisting back-country roads divide the tourists
from the locals. Tourists meander, gazing at cattle-dotted meadows
even if wildflowers aren't in season. Natives steam up in full
gotta-get-there mode.
</P>
<P>
   That's today. But much of Washington County's appeal is rooted
in a slower era.
</P>
<P>
   In downtown Chappell Hill, a picturesque peek back in time, the
Chappell Hill Historical Society Museum and a number of homes (many
moved from elsewhere) have been spiffed up in early-1900s style.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Texana Cigar &AMP; Coffee Co., there are several
antiques shops, some open only on weekends. The Chappell Hill Bank
is the oldest continuously operated bank in Texas, still open for
business daily.
</P>
<P>
   Winding up FM 1155 to Washington for another dose of history,
you can savor white split-rail fences showcasing the elaborate
weekend getaways of big-city types, just a pasture away from
farmhouses dating back almost acentury.
</P>
<P>
   The population of Washington has shrunk to fewer than 250 souls,
but in the 1830s, as revolutionary fervor ran high, this place was
hopping. A convention called in 1836 adopted the Texas Declaration
of Independence, kicking off the revolution.
</P>
<P>
   All of that is recounted at the Star of the Republic Museum, on
the grounds of Washington-on-the-Brazos State Historical Park.
</P>
<P>
   The park has a reconstruction of Independence Hall, where the
declaration was signed, and the 1844 farmhouse residence of Anson
Jones, last president of the Republic of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A living-history farm around Jones' home will open next spring.
It will replicate an 1850s farm; park employees will raise corn and
cotton, work a kitchen garden, care for livestock and prepare their
noon meal from the land's bounty.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, history buffs can continue their Washington County
excursion just to the north.
</P>
<P>
   Independence, named in 1836 in honor of Texas' independence from
Mexico, allows visitors to tour early homes and a one-room
schoolhouse by appointment.
</P>
<P>
   The stone Independence Baptist Church, which organized Baylor
University _ the original location in Independence is now reduced
to ruins _ offers another interesting bit of history.
</P>
<P>
   But for some people, Independence means only one thing: roses.
The Antique Rose Emporium is awash in antique varieties of roses
and other garden plants, nestled among restored homes and
outbuildings.
</P>
<P>
   A favorite stop for kids _ and, if truth be known, for adults,
too _ is the Monastery of St. Clare, on Texas 105 between
Washington and Brenham. It's home to the Franciscan Poor Clare
Nuns, who support themselves in part by raising and selling
miniature horses.
</P>
<P>
   They began raising the miniatures _ no taller than 34 inches _
in the early 1980s in Corpus Christi. When they moved to 98 acres
in Washington County a few years later, the horse operation came,
too.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters are cloistered nuns, required to spend much of their
day in prayer. Miniature horses are a perfect fit, since their care
takes only a few hours daily.
</P>
<P>
   The public is welcome 2-4 p.m. daily except Easter week.
Donations are accepted at a small gift shop, and visitors are
invited to spend time in the chapel.
</P>
<P>
   The monastery's setting is pastoral, but most people whip
through, dutifully snapping a picture of the kids with the horses
before heading out to the next attraction. You are welcome to relax
at picnic tables on the shady grounds while you enjoy the docile
animals, whose bulging stomachs attest to their endless willingness
to munch hay scooped from the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Another few miles and you're in Brenham, the county hub.
</P>
<P>
   It is home to the area's best-known employer, Blue Bell
Creameries, as well as Blinn College and a downtown packed with
antiques and collectibles shops and enough restaurants to offer
some variety.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Bell factory sits on the western edge of town, where
Brenham's original bungalows have given way to modern brick
subdivisions. It projects a faux-vintage atmosphere, an attempt to
re-create the days when the old Brenham Creamery Co. began making
ice cream in 1911. There are brick sidewalks and old-fashioned
street lamps, and a 1932 Blue Bell Ford ice-cream truck sits shiny
in a shady courtyard. ``DO NOT sit, touch or climb on,'' a sign
instructs anyone who might be tempted.
</P>
<P>
   Tours generally are offered weekdays, but call ahead
(409-830-2197).
</P>
<P>
   Guides offer a few technical details _ air is added for that
creamy smoothness _ but don't expect any trade secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect to snap any photos, either. Would-be corporate
spies and zealous tourists alike are warned to leave cameras behind
or risk ejection from the tour.
</P>
<P>
   Making ice cream isn't as stomach-churning as making sausage,
but it is a bit tedious, and tour participants tend to get
restless. Blue Bell rewards them with a free scoop of ice cream,
served in a small parlor next to the gift shop.
</P>
<P>
   For those who can't wait or who want to skip the tour, the ice
cream is for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Civic boosters promote downtown Brenham as the central lure of
Washington County tourism. The sprawling area, built between the
1860s and 1920s as a wave of West European immigrants moved to the
area, hasn't completed its touristy tarting up, with the occasional
finance company and empty storefront scattered among the antiques
stores and upscale clothing shops.
</P>
<P>
   But there is plenty of charm, especially along and around
historic Ant Street. Shops offer everything from vintage furniture
and glass to cheesy doodads.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this, some of that _ a little more of the mix-and-match
style of Washington County. &QL;

FOOTLOOSE AND LUGGAGE-FREE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn., Fla., Ill., Utah, Calif., N.M.)   By BETSY WADE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When you are hauling luggage and skis through airports, onto
rental-car shuttles and into the snow, you swear you would pay
anything to turn the task over to someone else.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are such people. Longtime package companies like United
Parcel Service and Federal Express, and a newcomer, are doing some
heavy lifting so vacationers can travel with carry-ons only. For a
price.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The new company, Travelite, in suburban Chicago, after shipping
materials to conventions for 14 years, has expanded into baggage.
It picks up and, for a fee based on weight and distance, delivers
luggage to a hotel in the United States at roughly the time its
owners arrive. The company's Virtual Bellhop program uses messenger
services and express companies, providing the same coverage for
loss that the airlines have been providing domestically, $1,250 per
passenger now, but rising this month to $2,500.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although spokesmen for United Parcel and Federal Express sound
cool about handling baggage, saying that their focus remains
business-to-business shipping, they have been accommodating
travelers just the same.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shunning the luggage carousel is not cheap; it may be as much as
another airline ticket. But many consider it worthwhile: Carolyn
Tancotti, the front desk manager for the Thunderbird Lodge and
Chalets in Taos, N.M., said that UPS regularly comes to the door
with luggage and skis for arriving guests. Her estimate was that
10-20 percent of lodge guests now ship their stuff ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest hurdle in shipping is being sure the hotel has a
catcher's mitt. It is no fun to crawl through cartons in storerooms
desperately seeking material sent too far in advance. Travelite's
president, William F. Cippola, says that his shipping companies
hold the baggage until the day the travelers arrive.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is an evolving area. Anyone who wants to try it should
first call the hotel to be sure it can receive bags without owners
attached. Travelers should know that air shipments are subject to
the same rules as checked luggage; pressurized hair sprays and
other hazardous materials, for example, should not be included.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To get ball-park estimates, we created two scenarios, one a
shipment of a family's skis from Manhattan to the Thunderbird Lodge
in Taos, and the other to get four suitcases from Minneapolis to a
cruise ship pier in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The comparisons are complex because United Parcel wants the
items put into containers; Federal Express has a plastic sleeve to
go over ski bags and will accept suitcases as is or in cartons.
Travelite does the packaging.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ski areas have their heads up for such plans. Deer Valley, Utah,
near Park City, for example, in a program with FedEx, will accept
skis and poles and stash them near the lift for $45. Skiers aiming
at Deer Valley or Park City should call ahead, (800) 558-3337, to
get this rate. Jess Bunn, a spokesman for FedEx, said that the
company was negotiating with resorts in Colorado on this sort of
plan, so when reservations are made it is worth asking what is
feasible.
</P>
<P>
   The cruise venture is trickier. Carnival, the biggest in the
field, says it has no provision for bags shipped ahead. But
Silversea in Fort Lauderdale and Crystal in Los Angeles and
Cunard-Seabourn, with longer and more expensive cruises, say they
can arrange with ground operators to handle bags that come ahead,
and get them into suites in time for embarkation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never said no to a guest,'' Jennifer Lawrence Schott
of Silversea said.
</P>
<P>
   Liz Jakeway of Celebrity Cruises said it was looking into the
idea. The comparisons show that planning reduces prices: get the
skis off a week ahead and save major dollars. Comparison shopping
for each trip is advisable.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Virtual Bellhop service will pick up and package two pairs of
adult skis and two pairs of children's skis from Manhattan's West
Side and ship them to the lodge in Taos for a third-day delivery
for $210. Second-day delivery costs $245 and next-day air $262.
Third day means articles picked up on Monday will be delivered
Thursday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   United Parcel requires the sender to package the skis. Sporting
goods shops sell telescoping hard plastic containers called
SporTubes for one or two pairs of skis; at Paragon in New York they
cost $100 or $150. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Using specifications for these containers, Kenneth E. Shapero, a
spokesman for United Parcel, said that two such containers if
picked up at home and sent ``second-day air'' would cost $141.25,
cheaper than Virtual Bellhop, but one must buy containers. If
picked up for next-day delivery, the cost would be $194. Automatic
coverage is $100 in value per package; additional coverage costs 35
cents per $100. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FedEx refers inquiries about its service to its Web site,
www.fedex.com. People who enjoy this sort of thing can enter ZIP
codes, weights and dimensions to learn what a cost will be; Bunn
says that FedEx uses the higher of the costs from a weight chart or
a dimension chart. Using dimensions, two ski containers, each with
two pairs inside, if picked up at home (the pickup adds $3 per
package) and delivered on the third business day _ a day later than
United Parcel's ``second-day air'' _ would cost $110.20. Picked up
for second-day delivery, the cost would come to $119.50. For
next-day delivery, $171.50.
</P>
<P>
   If no extra value is declared on a FedEx package, it is set at
$100; for a payment of $2.50, coverage goes to $500, and the cost
is 50 cents for each $100 thereafter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As for getting four suitcases to a pier, Virtual Bellhop prices
the Minneapolis-Fort Lauderdale venture at $121 for third-day
delivery, $130 for second-day and $165 for next-day. Cippola says
that his company estimates that four suitcases will weigh 100
pounds total. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   United Parcel wants the suitcases put into cartons, and
estimates each suitcase's weight at 40 pounds. The prices with
pickup at home are close to the drop-off prices because, Shapero
says, the company wants to encourage pickups. For fourth-day
delivery, the cost for the four pieces, if picked up, would be
$101.48. With pickup for second-day delivery, the cost is $279. For
overnight, pickup included again, it comes to $387.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The FedEx Web site shows the cost for 100 pounds of suitcase,
whether one or four, at $149 if picked up for delivery on the
fourth day; for second-day, $162, and for next-day delivery, $238.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Virtual Bellhop, (877) 235-5467, can provide estimates once it
is given details. The Web site is www.virtualbellhop.com; the
address is 31632 North Ellis Drive, Suite 304, Volo, Ill. 60073. &QL;

   United Parcel Service can be reached at (800) 742-5877;

   A special report on women in sports from the Austin
American-Statesman
</P>
<P>
   John Maher of the Austin American-Statesman has written an
in-depth story on women in sports in the 20th century. The story is
written from a historical perspective
</P>
<P>
   and chronicles how difficult it was for women's sports to become
established, especially in the first half of the century. A photo
of Aileen Riggin-Soule, who at 93 is the oldest living U.S. gold
medalist (1920 Olympics), is available for use with the story. If
you have questions or need more information, call Austin
American-Statesman Sports Editor David Humphrey at 512 445-3960 or
Cox News Service in Atlanta at 404 526-5456. Here is the budget
line for the story:
</P>
<P>
   WOMENSPORTS _ AUSTIN, Texas _ The 20th Century is really the
first in which women seriously compete in athletics. As the century
begins the founder of the Olympics, Baron Pierre de Coubertin, is
adamantly opposed to their participation in his event. There are no
pro leagues, no college scholarships. We chronicle the women's
sports boom, the changing attitudes and lingering prejudices. We
recount some of Texan Babe Didrikson's trials and triumphs, and the
early Olympic days are retold by a pair of nonagenarians who dived
in the 1920 Olympics in Antwwerp, Aileen Soule and Alice Landon.
Texas' oldest Olympian, Dorothy Langkop of Dallas, also recalls
what it was like for women athletes in the early 1930s. Many of the
stars of the first women's professional sports Tour, the LPGA, were
pupils of Harvey Penick, including Betsy Rawls, who talks about the
early days of the tour. We go through Title IX and one of its
products, the U.S Women's World Cup win. (Maher, Austin
American-Statesman). 117. WITH PHOTO.

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Holy guacamole! Y2K may not be Bubba's
biggest problem.
</P>
<P>
   An industry expert predicted Monday that fewer ``dualies'' _
dual-wheel pickups _ and other heavy-duty Cowboy Cadillacs will be
plying the highways and back roads of Texas if the state opts for
stricter California emission limits for 2004 models.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe if you adopt the California standards, you will have
less vehicle selection and less of the big vehicles will be
available,'' said Alan Weverstad, 50, director of vehicle emissions
and fuel efficiency for General Motors' Public Policy Center and a
spokesman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The auto industry has traditionally resisted tougher emission
standards, which can prove costly. But Weverstad said a less
restrictive proposal by the federal Environmental Protection Agency
makes sense for both the public and auto manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Some Texas truck owners, a Chevy truck sales manager and a
spokesman for the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission
said Weverstad is jumping the gun by suggesting that stricter
pollution standards might make large pickups with manual
transmissions and heavy towing capacity unavailable in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But even a suggestion was enough to rankle some truck owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't think it'll happen,'' said Granbury resident Gary
Rains. ``We'd probably secede from the union.''
</P>
<P>
   Rains, 58, who owns a Chevy S-10 and was looking over new
pickups with his daughter at Troy Aikman Auto Mall in Fort Worth,
was clearly unsettled by the suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like, well, it's like taking chicken-fried steak away
from this state,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And if such proposed restrictions cause upheavals in the pickup
market, he had his own prediction.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a whole new bunch of politicians elected if it
does happen,'' said Rains, a parts buyer for Bell Helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   Weverstad, interviewed by telephone from his home in Clarkston,
Mich., said that the tighter California controls meant a difference
of just 1 percent in overall emissions. ``And for no good reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers, he said, would be building trucks that meet one
standard for four states _ Texas, California, New York and
Massachusetts _ and trucks that meet different standards for the
rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crazy thing about this is that, environmentally, there is
very little difference,'' he said. ``And, according to our
modeling, the federal program will be environmentally superior
through the year 2019.''
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman for the Texas Natural Resource Conservation
Commission scoffed at Weverstad's assertions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's the study to back that up? Where's the data to show
that?'' asked agency spokesman Tom Kelley, who added: ``We are just
beginning the process of considering standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Garcia, truck sales manager at the Aikman lot, expressed
doubt that any state agency would dare tamper with Texans' love
affair with their pickups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never happen,'' Garcia said. ``It's like the new refrigerant
for air conditioners. It was supposed to be a big deal, but wasn't.
You're just not going to slow down the Texas truck market unless
you do something drastic.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Couch, 69, a Southlake real estate broker who owns a 1973
Ford half-ton pickup, said, ``I'm sure they'll come up with some
exceptions.''
</P>
<P>
   But pollution ``is a problem, and they'll have to take the bull
by the horns,'' added Couch, interviewed at the Mac Churchill GMC
dealership in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Just how the matter will be bulldogged hasn't been decided,
Kelley said, adding that the state environmental agency will hold a
series of public hearings, including one in Fort Worth on Jan. 28.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton last week proposed federal regulations
designed to reduce air pollution and emissions by 90 percent. He
proposed requiring that sport utility vehicles, minivans and
pickups meet the same tailpipe emission standards as cars,
beginning with 2004 models and phased in over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 16, the state environmental agency called for tighter
emission controls from 2004 and more effective emissions testing to
improve air quality in such metropolitan areas as Fort
Worth-Dallas, Houston-Galveston and Beaumont-Port Arthur.

<P>
   The diet of the moment, low in carbohydrates and high in
protein, will attain the distinction in a few days of having
survived into a third century. Its current proponents, like Dr.
Robert Atkins, Dr. Barry Sears and Drs. Michael and Mary Eades,
should say a little prayer of thanks every night to the man who
helped make them rich. For this diet, like so many
too-good-to-be-true prescriptions, has gone in and out of fashion,
in this case for more than 100 years, in the great American search
for the holy grail of easy weight loss.
</P>
<P>
   In 1863, William Banting, coffin maker to the Duke of
Wellington, first popularized this regimen, which we mistakenly
believe is thoroughly modern. At 5-foot-5 and over 200 pounds, he
was so bulky he had to walk down stairs backward. A British ear
surgeon, William Harvey, prescribed a diet free of fats, starches
and sugars, becoming the first in a long line of medical doctors
and doctors of philosophy claiming expertise in a subject with
which they had little experience. The diet, which provided about
1,100 calories a day, worked, at least for a while, and Banting
became the publisher of the first popular diet book, ``A Letter on
Corpulence Addressed to the Public.''
</P>
<P>
   After he died, in 1878, ``Banting'' became the preferred dieting
method on both sides of the Atlantic. Ever since, there has been an
almost unbroken succession of diet doctors offering variations on
the theme: the Grapefruit Diet, also known as the Mayo Diet; Herman
Taller's ``Calories Don't Count''; Irwin Stillman's ``Doctor's
Quick Weight Loss Diet''; Herman Tarnower's ``Scarsdale Diet.'' The
diet went out of fashion in the early 1980s, replaced by the
high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet. Now it is back with a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   Of course most people would prefer to lose weight while eating
steak and eggs instead of the celery and carrot sticks of other
diets, but they lose weight doing so for the same reason people
lose weight on any diet: they expend more energy (calories) than
they consume. Eventually the low-carb diet will once again be
replaced by another gimmick, but it will never be far away.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things never die out,'' said Dr. William Jarvis, a
professor of public health and preventive medicine at Loma Linda
University and a co-founder of the National Council for Reliable
Health Information. ``They become part of the culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Take Fletcherizing, which is also still with us but not under
that name. At the beginning of the 20th century Horace Fletcher, a
wealthy American businessman, spent some of his fortune persuading
people to follow his lead and chew their food until it liquefied,
on the theory that doing so would cause them to lose weight and
remove poisons from their bodies. It is unclear whether it worked
permanently for Fletcher. Contemporary accounts say he lost weight
but eventually gained it back. Meantime, people all over the world
were masticating until their jaws hurt.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``Revolution at the Table: the Transformation of the
American Diet,'' (Oxford University Press, 1988), Harvey Levenstein
notes that such famous reformers and writers as Upton Sinclair,
Henry James and William James were adherents of Fletcherizing. Not
so long ago I heard a nutritionist suggest the same weight loss
technique.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is food combining. William Howard Hays introduced the
concept in the 1930s, and it is alive and well today in Judy
Mazel's ``New Beverly Hills Diet,'' which prescribes eating certain
foods at certain times and never combining carbohydrates and
protein.
</P>
<P>
   Even diet drugs guaranteed to maim and kill have reappeared
decades after they were banned. During World War I the Russians
gave their soldiers 2,4-dinitrophenol, a chemical found in
explosives, to keep them warm in winter. Dinitrophenol was an
effective weight-loss tool because it accelerated the metabolism,
making the body burn more fat.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1920s, scientists looked at therapeutic uses of the
chemical but decided it was too dangerous. That didn't stop diet
doctors from prescribing it until 1938, when it was banned because
the bodies began to pile up.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Dr. Nicholas Bachynsky was using it in his weight loss
clinics in Texas and elsewhere in the 1980s. (In 1986 he was fined
for violating regulations of the Food and Drug Administration.)
</P>
<P>
   Last week among the links to Web sites warning of the hazards
was one that read: ``Dinitrophenol for fat loss. This stuff is
amazing.'' There was nothing on the Web site that the link led to,
but obviously there are still people who think it is a great weight
loss aid, just as people still think amphetamines are safe for
losing weight.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, the public was taken with the vinegar diet, based
on ``Folk Medicine'' (Fawcett), by Dr. D.C. Jarvis. He contended
that cider vinegar combined with honey, kelp, lecithin and vitamin
B6 not only cured arthritis but also produced weight loss. The
rationale was that oil and vinegar don't mix. Out of that grew the
concept that vinegar is a fat cutter. It was only one more step to
the theory that vinegar cuts the fat off the body. Thus was born
``The Cider Vinegar, Lecithin, Kelp, B6 Diet,'' heavily advertised
in women's magazines, accompanied by articles describing the diet
as miraculous. An article in the January 1974 issue of Family
Circle cleared the shelves of these ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   People who rushed out to buy them may have skipped over the part
that said the mysterious mixture always worked ``as long as a
low-calorie regime was strictly adhered to.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a quick look on the Internet turned up 11 sites
advocating the diet.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1970s, people were moving on to starch blockers,
which are a concentrate of raw legumes like red kidney beans and
are supposed to prevent starches from splitting into sugar. If this
were true, it would mean that you could eat potatoes and rice and
bread without absorbing them; they would pass through the
intestinal tract undigested, taking all their calories with them.
</P>
<P>
   By 1982 starch blockers had made the pages of People magazine as
the latest in a long line of quick-weight-loss gimmicks, even
though reputable scientists had declared them useless. The FDA
seized more than a million starch blockers in 1982. But the
agency's regulatory authority was severely curtailed by the passage
of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act in 1994, and now
starch blockers are back.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's interesting about starch blockers is how much science
there is that they don't work,'' said Dr. Marion Nestle, chairwoman
of the department of nutrition and food studies at New York
University.
</P>
<P>
   Yet check one of many sites on the Web selling starch blockers
like Phase'oLean Forte, L.M. Enterprises and Life Plus, where
exactly the same promises that caused their seizure 17 years ago
are still being made.
</P>
<P>
   Magic cures will always be with us, and there is no reason to
believe we'll be acting any smarter when 2099 rolls around.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When New Year's Eve was only a dark cloud on the
horizon, a few weeks ago, it was easy to plan: Just stay home and
celebrate, out of the craziness. Now that the night is almost upon
us, with restaurants and theaters closing and manholes being welded
shut against terrorists, my planning has taken on real urgency:
Stay home and celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of holing up with a ration of caviar and Champagne is
beginning to sound like doomsday itself. I want to have some fun,
not build a bunker. I figured there had to be a way to have a meal
to remember _ something elegant but uncomplicated. I didn't want to
spend the day in the kitchen or the evening washing dishes.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurants brave enough to keep on serving offered little
inspiration. The chefs, as always, have loaded their New Year's
menus with luxuries like foie gras and caviar and truffles, all the
excess you would expect. Which is why, perhaps, so many are having
trouble filling their reservation books.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who have inflated their prices have learned a hard
lesson. La Fourchette could not fill its tables with a
$500-a-person tasting menu. Once it became a la carte, it sold out.
Three weeks ago Clementine reduced its five-course menu from $375
to $275, in order to secure a full house. Gotham Bar and Grill
cancelled its dinner altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Other restaurants like Quilty's, Verbena and Le Bernardin
planned to close all along. Eric Ripert, the chef at Le Bernardin,
is cooking for his family. Diane Forley, the chef at Verbena, is
escaping with a friend to a weekend house in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   Many more chefs, whose restaurants will be open, are not
planning to be in those kitchens _ just another reason I'm glad not
to be eating out. But that doesn't mean spending the night at home
is an excuse to be lazy, or worse, sentimental. I want to have an
evening of true celebration, to eat things I adore and not work too
hard at it.
</P>
<P>
   Before I got too embroiled in my plan, though, I called some
chefs who were off for the night for advice, to see what they were
doing. Bill Telepan, the chef at Judson Grill, sounded as though he
were on a deserted island dreaming of his ideal meal. ``I'm going
to spend some money on wine,'' he said, ``and I'm going to get a
beautiful dry-aged porterhouse and some oysters.'' He was
considering buying the super-sized chocolate chip cookies from
Levain Bakery in Manhattan for dessert.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its just stuff we like,'' Telepan added. ``You don't want to
be in the kitchen making this mess and have to clean up.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure what I expected a three-star chef to say he was
making for dinner, but it wasn't that. Then I called Tom Colicchio,
the chef at Gramercy Tavern, which is also closed on New Year's
Eve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm staying home and I'm getting a tin of caviar and two of
the best steaks I can get, baked potatoes and a 1976 Lafite,'
Colicchio said without hesitation. ``And that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not even a sauce? ``I have a great bottle of wine, thats enough
sauce,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That did it. If these two talented chefs could cook steaks for
the big night, I could eat simply, too. A menu began to filter into
my head. But steaks were not in my future.
</P>
<P>
   Oysters were. Champagne would be a thread carried through the
meal. With a great bottle, there's no need to change to something
else. Its effervescence lightens foods and would naturally skew the
dishes I chose toward the simple and pure.
</P>
<P>
   Since it would just be a friend and me, oysters would be a fine
way to begin. I could open enough for two as we stand around and
ponder the first few sips of Champagne. (They're too much work for
large groups.)
</P>
<P>
   Arranging a plate of oysters is much like selecting a plate of
cheeses. You want a variety of flavors and textures. It is not
difficult to do: oysters vary from strong and briny to grassy and
sweet. I plan to get Kumamoto oysters, a sweet and nutty variety
from the west coast; Belon, a fat oyster with a strong ocean flavor
from Maine, and perhaps Nantucket oysters, a light, briny variety.
Four of each should be plenty.
</P>
<P>
   The only real cooking I would do would be for the main course. I
had wanted to use caviar, but not in a typical way, so I revived a
dish from memory: thin pasta tossed with caviar, scallions and
chopped egg. I learned the dish five years ago while I was working
in a restaurant south of Milan. As the owner of the restaurant
assembled it, blanketing the fresh pasta with eggs and caviar, I
can remember thinking what a strange combination it was. He smiled
as he handed me a taste. He knew what I was thinking.
</P>
<P>
   I had never tasted something so elegant. It was like a refined
spaghetti carbonara, rich with egg, and the salt from the caviar
kept tempting me to another bite. I have never encountered the dish
anywhere else, and that makes it even better for the holiday. Who
wants to eat things you regularly have at home or in a restaurant?
</P>
<P>
   I had a salad in mind next, but nothing too jarring after the
relative mildness of the spaghetti. I didn't want chewy greens or
too much crunch, just clean flavor. Bibb is a beautiful lettuce
with soft, sweet inner leaves. Just a handful per person is enough
to clean the palate and swing the meal in another direction. I
decided to combine them with Clementines, which are in season now.
By cutting them into sections and tossing them in the salad, you
get a dash of sweetness without it being too fruity.
</P>
<P>
   Dessert was tricky _ it had to bring the meal, and the
millennium, to a close. Something creamy or fluffy would not do _
much too flabby and indefinite. I could not bring myself to buy
those chocolate chip cookies from Levain Bakery, no matter how good
they are.
</P>
<P>
   Though I almost never want chocolate desserts, chocolate somehow
seems right on this night: it has a way of blocking out any flavors
you've had previously, and ends a meal with clarity and comfort.
But I also wanted something with zing to close this chapter of
time, so I settled on a dense _ not molten _ chocolate cake spiced
with coarsely ground black pepper. It, too can be made ahead (in
fact, it is better if it's made at least a day ahead so the spices
and chocolate have a chance to blend).
</P>
<P>
   The cake, at once rich and austere, seemed to reflect less about
how I feel about the end of this century, and more of what I look
forward to: a little spice to enliven this era of excess. &QL;

<P>
   1. Select only pale inner leaves of the lettuce; place in salad
bowl. You should have 4 large handfuls. Zest clementines; reserve
the zest. Cut off the ends of the clementines, cutting deeply
enough to reveal flesh. Using a small paring knife, cut off
remaining peel, cutting end to end in about {-inch-wide strips.
Take away the membrane, but try not to cut away too much flesh.
Remove sections one by one, slicing lengthwise into the flesh, just
inside the membrane. Add the sections to bowl with the lettuce.
</P>
<P>
   2. In a small bowl, whisk together the garlic, { teaspoon
reserved clementine zest, lemon juice, vinegar, mustard, honey,
thyme, salt and pepper. While whisking, gradually pour in olive
oil, then hazelnut oil. Continue whisking until emulsified. Taste
and adjust seasoning.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    As we head uncertainly into the new millennium, some momentous
changes are afoot in the field of behavioral research. They are
revolutionizing our conception of ourselves as the smartest species
on the planet.
 &HT;    It's not that we've suddenly been dethroned as king of the
cerebral hill, but rather that we've gained a better understanding
of ourselves as thoughtful, sentient beings.
 &HT;    Over the past decade, neuroscientists have gained extraordinary
new insight into human behavior, using new technologies to probe
deeper into the most mysterious black box of all -- the source of
all personal consciousness -- the human brain.
 &HT;    Like explorers in search of a strange new world, researchers are
combing the depths of what may be the final frontier of scientific
discovery: the human mind. And they are revealing secrets that have
aroused our curiosity since the dawn of man.
 &HT;    These new discoveries could have significant implications for
the human species, in that they offer us the potential to affect
not only our destiny but also our very nature as a species. If we
are someday able to alter the way the mind works -- the way we
think -- it could lead to unprecedented changes in how we define
ourselves as human beings, and unprecedented ethical choices for
society.
 &HT;    Such choices could force us to make some harrowing decisions.
Who, for example, should be subject to behavioral modification if
we have the power to mold human behavior? Could people be modified
against their will? What kinds of behavior would be considered
``normal''? And who will govern this process?
 &HT;    Just 20 years ago, such quandaries would have been unthinkable.
Indeed, for most of the 20th century -- a time of unparalleled
scientific achievement -- the brain has remained as impenetrable as
ever. So like our ancestors through the ages, we have continued to
wonder about what it means to be human: to think, to observe, to
feel.
 &HT;    What makes us so exquisitely sensitive to the touch of a loved
one, or so enraptured at the prospect of a new birth? How can we be
so loyal to our closest friends, yet so indifferent to the
suffering of strangers in far-off places? Just what is it that
makes a human being tick?
 &HT;    Of course, there's no simple answer, but new scientific
breakthroughs have reinforced the notion of a biological model of
human behavior. For the first time, we've been able to correlate
specific types of behavior with specific parts of the brain,
linking those regions with readily identifiable thought processes.
On the basis of these early findings, it appears that physical
pathways in the brain may dictate much, if not all, of human
behavior.
 &HT;    It's an intuitively appealing theory, and it's consistent with
recent research. For example, a 1997 Harvard study has shown a
positive correlation between regional blood flow to certain parts
of the brain and the level of anxiety experienced by various
individuals.
 &HT;    Using positron emission tomography (PET) to provide images of
brain activity, researchers provoked anxiety symptoms in a group of
patients suffering from conditions like posttraumatic stress
disorder and then watched for increased neural activity in specific
locations. They found that increased activity in specific regions
of the brain correlated not only with the presence of anxiety but
also with the degree of anxiety reported by individuals in the
study.
 &HT;    In another PET study at the University of Texas, scientists
provoked emotions of sadness in healthy volunteers and then looked
for changes in regional blood flow that would indicate shifts in
brain metabolism. They found increased metabolism in the ``limbic''
region of the brain and decreased metabolism in the ``neocortical''
region.
 &HT;    Intriguingly, when they looked at another group of patients who
were recovering from chronic depression, the reverse pattern --
involving the same regions -- was seen: the neocortical region
increased its metabolism while the limbic area had diminished
activity. Reciprocal changes in mood were thus accompanied by
parallel changes in brain metabolism.
 &HT;    Correlations between brain activity and overt behaviors have
also been shown in patients undergoing neurosurgery. A 1999 report
in the Journal of Neurosurgery recounted how a group of patients
experienced notable cognitive, mood and personality changes
following surgery for Parkinson's disease. Postoperatively, one
individual actually lost his aggressiveness and drive -- traits
that had previously defined his relationships with family and
business associates.
 &HT;    All these findings support the notion that human behavior is
ultimately the product of physical processes in the brain. If this
is true, it has enormous implications for mankind in the next
millennium. Imagine a world in which doctors are able to manipulate
human behavior the way we manipulate broken bones today.
 &HT;    The possibilities are enthralling. And chilling. Physicians
might perform surgical procedures on prisoners to reduce aggression
or violent tendencies. Exasperated parents might ask for a cerebral
transplant to cure their hyperactive child. And surgical implants
might alter everything from native intelligence to sexual
orientation.
 &HT;    More insidious interventions might arise as well. Psychiatric
patients might suffer from treatments that remove parts of their
individuality as well as their affliction. Government leaders might
use behavioral modification to pacify a restless populace, or to
subdue political opponents. Political prisoners might be subjected
to a new kind of abuse: the alteration of their personalities,
rather than their bodies, beyond recognition.
 &HT;    It's not as farfetched as it seems. In fact, we already
manipulate human behavior today: antidepressants, for instance,
elevate patients' moods to the point where they can make it through
the day without contemplating suicide. Compulsive behaviors like
hand-washing can be substantially reduced with the help of drugs
that affect serotonin levels in the brain.
 &HT;    It's only a matter of time before this type of intervention
becomes more sophisticated, and potentially more dangerous. While
behavioral interventions have the potential to alleviate much
suffering, such awesome power cannot be taken lightly.
 &HT;    What ethical choices will we make when we have the ability to
profoundly alter not only the heart but also the soul of man? How
far will we go in altering the ``natural'' tendencies of human
beings? What impact will this eventually have on the evolution of
our species?
 &HT;    These questions will have to be addressed in the future, when
partial (or total) brain replacement becomes as routine as hip
replacement today. As with all revolutionary scientific advances,
we will need to exercise great care before redefining human nature.
After all, we've come a long way in two million years, and in many
ways our nature remains as inscrutable as ever.

IMMIGRATION ISSUE TURNS BUSH INTO MODERATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By R.A. DYER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ He's on middle ground on immigration, drawing
praise and scorn.
</P>
<P>
   When legal immigrants in the United States were stripped of food
stamps and other benefits by changes in the federal welfare law,
immigration advocates in Texas decided to visit the Governor's
Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Would Gov. George W. Bush, they asked, support the use of state
funds to replace the lost benefits, at least for children, the
elderly and the disabled?
</P>
<P>
   The governor did not attend the 1997 meeting. But Anne
Dunkelberg of the Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities,
a liberal think tank, recalls the cordial response from his aide:
``We cannot support this legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   The bills failed. But several months later, the governor
allocated, by executive decree, $18 million from the Texas
Department of Human Services to replace food assistance to legal
immigrants who were elderly or disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's two responses show the flip sides of his public posture
on immigration. The front-runner for the Republican presidential
nomination has walked the middle ground on immigration, a balancing
act that alternately appeals to and angers the two sides of the
debate.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives such as Dan Stein, director of the Federation for
American Immigration Reform, say Bush has not pushed strongly
enough to curb illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for immigrants, on the other hand, say he hasn't done
enough to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some people, that he's not aggressively anti-immigrant
translates into him being pro-immigrant,'' said Dunkelberg. ``But I
don't think it's a fair assessment to say that he is good on
immigration issues, simply because he didn't do anything really
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Illegal immigration affects border states such as Texas much
more than other states. The federal government estimates that
700,000 undocumented immigrants live in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bush has not emerged as a leader in the nation's immigration
debate during his time as governor. Not until recently has he
spelled out specific views on immigration issues that he likely
would face if elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Bush outlined those issues recently in written responses to
questions from the Star-Telegram.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with his moderate stance, he backed both increased
border enforcement and the expanded use of special temporary visas
for immigrant workers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he supports the expansion of Operation Hold the Line,
a multimillion-dollar effort to control illegal immigration along
the U.S. border. The goal, Bush said, is to ``make the crossing of
both people, and contraband, more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to boost the Mexican economy, he said, are also crucial
to slowing the illegal flow of its citizens to America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most importantly, I understand that a healthy Mexico is good
for America,'' he said. ``Immigrants are coming to America to feed
their families and provide for their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The long-term solution is increased trade with Mexico because
free trade is the best way for Mexico to grow a strong middle
class, and improve the quality of life so that fewer people will
want to leave Mexico to seek a better life for their families.''
</P>
<P>
   On other immigration issues, Bush:
</P>
<P>
   _Supports expansion of the U.S. guest worker program, which
allows immigrant agricultural workers to come to the United States
under temporary H-2A visas. The program has come under fire both
from labor groups and from advocates of more restrictive
immigration policy.
</P>
<P>
   _Favors splitting the Immigration and Naturalization Service
into enforcement and what he called paperwork divisions.
</P>
<P>
   _Calls for issuing more H-1B visas, which permit the entry of
skilled computer workers. Proponents of stricter immigration laws
have opposed the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Said Stein, of the Federation for American Immigration Reform:
``The software industry is clamoring for people with skills in
various languages, and they're trying to get the cheapest labor
they can.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has made several statements that have drawn praise from
immigrant rights advocates and scorn from conservative quarters.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he has consistently extolled the economic
contribution of immigrants while rebuking politicians who engage in
immigrant bashing.
</P>
<P>
   While calling for strong border enforcement, Bush also says he
understands why many immigrants attempt to cross illegally into the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're coming here to provide for their families, and I
empathize with that,'' he said recently.
</P>
<P>
   More dramatic, however, were Bush's words regarding Proposition
187, the California referendum that barred children of undocumented
immigrants from attending public schools and withdrew other public
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   California voters adopted the referendum, although court action
has blocked most provisions. The referendum received unqualified
support from former California Gov. Pete Wilson and various
advocates of more restrictive immigration policy.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, then and now, has criticized Proposition 187, insisting
that such a measure would hurt Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children, of any background, should not be used as pawns in
bitter debates on education and immigration, or punished to make a
broader political point,'' Bush said during a recent campaign
appearance in California.
</P>
<P>
   Like other immigrant advocates, Maria Jimenez of the American
Friends Service Committee cites such comments in giving Bush high
marks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush has a more pragmatic, realistic assessment of
immigration, and the relationship between the United States and
Mexico,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1999 Texas legislative session, the Children Health
Insurance Program was one of the most visible policy decisions
regarding immigration. There, too, Bush walked the middle ground:
He did not offer public support of a plan to add legal immigrants,
but he signed the bill once they were added.
</P>
<P>
   The state's response to the federal welfare overhauls in 1996
also illustrated Bush's moderate stance, according to Dunkelburg.
Although she praised Bush's use of state money to replace lost
federal benefits, she noted that the appropriation did not cover
roughly 9,000 legal immigrant children who previously had food
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   But aides pointed out that Bush signed the children's health
care legislation that did cover immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor said he would not retroactively deny food stamps
to elderly and disabled immigrants,'' said Scott McClellan, a
spokesman for Bush's presidential campaign. ``He also supported the
(children's health care) legislation, and a number of those
children are of legal immigrants.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing moderate on various immigration issues may be
important for the Bush campaign strategy, especially if he hopes to
remain competitive in California, a state that carries 20 percent
of the electoral votes needed to win the White House. A moderate
shift to the GOP by California's Hispanic voters could help Bush
create a margin of victory there.
</P>
<P>
   For a GOP governor, Bush has had unprecedented success in
attracting Latino voters. During the 1998 gubernatorial election,
Bush beat Democrat Garry Mauro in the overwhelmingly Hispanic city
of El Paso. He also claimed to have won up to 40 percent of the
Hispanic vote in Texas during that election, although those figures
have been disputed as too high.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he likes his chances in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I intend to wage a vigorous campaign here,'' he said during a
recent stop in Los Angeles. ``I intend to reach out to Latino
voters.''

A PRIMER ON SEASONAL AFFECTIVE DISORDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JAVONNA MAY-MONS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   WHAT IS SEASONAL AFFECTIVE DISORDER?
</P>
<P>
   Seasonal Affective Disorder is a mood disorder marked by
depression during a certain time of year _ especially winter. Many
people refer to this disorder as ``winter blues,'' although it can
occur during any season. This terminology remains commonplace
because most cases begin with the onset of winter. Like any other
animal, humans react to the seasonal changes with adjustments in
mood, sleeping and eating habits. Those with Seasonal Affective
Disorder cannot function properly because of the severity of the
disorder's symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF SAD?
</P>
<P>
   The disorder, also known as SAD, is characterized by feelings of
sadness or lonliness before, during or after the winter season.
Other symptoms include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Daytime drowsiness
</P>
<P>
   _ Fatigue or loss of energy
</P>
<P>
   _ Difficulty concentrating
</P>
<P>
   _ Overeating of carbohydrates, leading to weight gain
</P>
<P>
   _ Headaches
</P>
<P>
   _ Inability to sleep
</P>
<P>
   _ Agitation and anxiety
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   HOW ARE THE ``WINTER BLUES'' DIFFERENT FROM SAD?
</P>
<P>
   Although seasonal depression has to do with a person's physical
reaction to seasonal changes, ``winter blues'' has more to do with
their psychological reaction. These ``bummed-out'' feelings can
last a few days to a few weeks, depending on the individual. The
blues are spawned from unrealistic expectations, unpleasant holiday
memories or the inability to be with one's family.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   WHAT DO YOU DO IF YOU THINK YOU MAY HAVE SAD?
</P>
<P>
   A person who thinks he or she has SAD should see a physician,
psychologist or psychiatrist who is familiar with the disorder. A
diagnosis requires that the person has experienced depression and
other symptoms during two consecutive winters. It's sometimes hard
to diagnose SAD because its symptoms follow the pattern of other
disorders.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of light during the winter months is the main cause of
this disorder. Sufferers may find relief through light therapy, in
which they are exposed to bright light for 30 minutes to two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Lifestyle changes may also help. According to the Mayo
Foundation for Medical Education and Research, increasing the light
in the home by adding lamps and trimming tree branches that block
sunlight is suggested. Other lifestyle adjustments include walking
outdoors during sunny days, taking winter vacations in warm, sunny
locations and exercising regularly. Stress management is also
suggested.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   HOW CAN I COPE WITH WINTER BLUES?
</P>
<P>
   Keeping holiday expectations realistic is one way to avoid the
holiday blues. People shouldn't expect to give the best, greatest
gifts or receive them.
</P>
<P>
   People look back at their childhood family celebrations as
either happy or unhappy times. Disappointment may occur when
traditions, people or plans change. Even worse, resentment can
arise when these things remain the same. Keep in mind that
traditions sometimes change and some family arguments never die.
Learning to accept change and deal with your family as they are is
one step on the road to prevention.

   Too much champagne, booze or wine is a holiday tradition that
promises to be more excessive this New Year's Eve as people party _
as the Artist Formerly Known as Prince once sang _ ``like it's
1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Medically speaking, all that revelry is going to do a number on
people's brains.
</P>
<P>
   Overindulging in alcoholic beverages causes blood vessels to
swell or dilate, which triggers headache pain, according to the
National Headache Foundation in San Francisco. Alcohol also acts as
a diuretic, which leads to dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   There's no quick fix for a bad hangover, but here are a few tips
on how to ease the suffering, courtesy of the NHF:
</P>
<P>
   _ Drink fluids containing minerals and salts: Drinks and broths
rich is minerals and salts relieve dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   _ Eat some honey before and/or after drinking. Honey supplies
fructose, a natural form of sugar, that helps metabolize the
alcohol and ease hangover symptoms. Tomato juice, another good
source of fructose, also helps cure a hangover.
</P>
<P>
   _ Drink coffee. Caffeine constricts swollen blood vessels, which
should provide some pain relief.
</P>
<P>
   _ Finally, a word of caution. While the alcohol is still in your
system, go easy on over-the-counter pain relievers, especially
acetaminophen _ the main ingredient in Tylenol _ which can cause
liver damage in some people when combined with alcohol.

</P>
<P>
   What is low key to Brown may sound quite ambitious to others: He
is sending out more than 12,000 invitations for the swearing-in
ceremony, but those without an official invitation still can attend
at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a public event,`` Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, a staunch supporter of the mayor, is being
invited. Four years ago Clinton interrupted Brown's inauguration
with a congratulatory call, which was piped over loudspeakers for
the crowd to hear.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, a Democrat, defeated Board of Supervisors President Tom
Ammiano in the Dec. 14 run-off election. It will be his second term
as mayor of the nation's 13th largest city.
</P>
<P>
   The 65-year-old Brown, who spent more than $3 million in the
costliest mayoral election in the city's history, is expected to
use his inaugural address to lay out a blueprint for the next four
years in office. What will he say? ``I don't know yet,`` he
answered in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   However, Brown said after his election victory that affordable
housing in an era of soaring real estate values would be the major
challenge of his second term.
</P>
<P>
   A chronic shortage of housing and the glittering economy of the
Silicon Valley have made the real estate market in San Francisco
one of the most expensive in the nation. Soaring rents helped
energize Ammiano's grass-roots campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor plans to tie the inaugural event into the one-year
anniversary of the reopening of City Hall. The building was closed
for three years for a massive restoration and seismic-strengthening
project before it opened Jan. 5, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   As for a big inaugural party, Brown said that was doubtful.
``Don't have the money,`` he said.
</P>
<P>
   What a turn-around from four years ago, when the word
inauguration was synonymous with party. First, there was the
swearing-in ceremony, then a massive public fete at Pier 45, with
entertainment by Huey Lewis and Santana, a $1,500 replica of the
Golden Gate Bridge and meals for 10,000 homeless and poor people
put on by some of San Francisco's finest restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Private donations financed most of the festivities, which cost
an estimated $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Brown's suggestion that the second inaugural would be
low key, he did not rule out a party to celebrate his new term. The
city's chief of protocol and one of San Francisco's preeminent
event planners, Charlotte Mailliard Swig Shultz, is on the
inaugural planning committee.

   EUROPE-STORMS (Paris) _ Still struggling to pick itself up after
being pounded by a fierce storm on Sunday, France was hit with
another, equally fierce, storm overnight, killing 22 people and

speech. But in New Hampshire over the next several weeks, Bush
plans to change all that. He'll be meeting with voters in a more

 &HT;    
 By STEPHEN L. COHEN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    As we head uncertainly into the new millennium, some momentous
changes are afoot in the field of behavioral research. They are
revolutionizing our conception of ourselves as the smartest species
on the planet.
 &HT;    It's not that we've suddenly been dethroned as king of the
cerebral hill, but rather that we've gained a better understanding
of ourselves as thoughtful, sentient beings.
 &HT;    Over the past decade, neuroscientists have gained extraordinary
new insight into human behavior, using new technologies to probe
deeper into the most mysterious black box of all -- the source of
all personal consciousness -- the human brain.
 &HT;    Like explorers in search of a strange new world, researchers are
combing the depths of what may be the final frontier of scientific
discovery: the human mind. And they are revealing secrets that have
aroused our curiosity since the dawn of man.
 &HT;    These new discoveries could have significant implications for
the human species, in that they offer us the potential to affect
not only our destiny but also our very nature as a species. If we
are someday able to alter the way the mind works -- the way we
think -- it could lead to unprecedented changes in how we define
ourselves as human beings, and unprecedented ethical choices for
society.
 &HT;    Such choices could force us to make some harrowing decisions.
Who, for example, should be subject to behavioral modification if
we have the power to mold human behavior? Could people be modified
against their will? What kinds of behavior would be considered
``normal''? And who will govern this process?
 &HT;    Just 20 years ago, such quandaries would have been unthinkable.
Indeed, for most of the 20th century -- a time of unparalleled
scientific achievement -- the brain has remained as impenetrable as
ever. So like our ancestors through the ages, we have continued to
wonder about what it means to be human: to think, to observe, to
feel.
 &HT;    What makes us so exquisitely sensitive to the touch of a loved
one, or so enraptured at the prospect of a new birth? How can we be
so loyal to our closest friends, yet so indifferent to the
suffering of strangers in far-off places? Just what is it that
makes a human being tick?
 &HT;    Of course, there's no simple answer, but new scientific
breakthroughs have reinforced the notion of a biological model of
human behavior. For the first time, we've been able to correlate
specific types of behavior with specific parts of the brain,
linking those regions with readily identifiable thought processes.
On the basis of these early findings, it appears that physical
pathways in the brain may dictate much, if not all, of human
behavior.
 &HT;    It's an intuitively appealing theory, and it's consistent with
recent research. For example, a 1997 Harvard study has shown a
positive correlation between regional blood flow to certain parts
of the brain and the level of anxiety experienced by various
individuals.
 &HT;    Using positron emission tomography (PET) to provide images of
brain activity, researchers provoked anxiety symptoms in a group of
patients suffering from conditions like posttraumatic stress
disorder and then watched for increased neural activity in specific
locations. They found that increased activity in specific regions
of the brain correlated not only with the presence of anxiety but
also with the degree of anxiety reported by individuals in the
study.
 &HT;    In another PET study at the University of Texas, scientists
provoked emotions of sadness in healthy volunteers and then looked
for changes in regional blood flow that would indicate shifts in
brain metabolism. They found increased metabolism in the ``limbic''
region of the brain and decreased metabolism in the ``neocortical''
region.
 &HT;    Intriguingly, when they looked at another group of patients who
were recovering from chronic depression, the reverse pattern --
involving the same regions -- was seen: the neocortical region
increased its metabolism while the limbic area had diminished
activity. Reciprocal changes in mood were thus accompanied by
parallel changes in brain metabolism.
 &HT;    Correlations between brain activity and overt behaviors have
also been shown in patients undergoing neurosurgery. A 1999 report
in the Journal of Neurosurgery recounted how a group of patients
experienced notable cognitive, mood and personality changes
following surgery for Parkinson's disease. Postoperatively, one
individual actually lost his aggressiveness and drive -- traits
that had previously defined his relationships with family and
business associates.
 &HT;    All these findings support the notion that human behavior is
ultimately the product of physical processes in the brain. If this
is true, it has enormous implications for mankind in the next
millennium. Imagine a world in which doctors are able to manipulate
human behavior the way we manipulate broken bones today.
 &HT;    The possibilities are enthralling. And chilling. Physicians
might perform surgical procedures on prisoners to reduce aggression
or violent tendencies. Exasperated parents might ask for a cerebral
transplant to cure their hyperactive child. And surgical implants
might alter everything from native intelligence to sexual
orientation.
 &HT;    More insidious interventions might arise as well. Psychiatric
patients might suffer from treatments that remove parts of their
individuality as well as their affliction. Government leaders might
use behavioral modification to pacify a restless populace, or to
subdue political opponents. Political prisoners might be subjected
to a new kind of abuse: the alteration of their personalities,
rather than their bodies, beyond recognition.
 &HT;    It's not as farfetched as it seems. In fact, we already
manipulate human behavior today: antidepressants, for instance,
elevate patients' moods to the point where they can make it through
the day without contemplating suicide. Compulsive behaviors like
hand-washing can be substantially reduced with the help of drugs
that affect serotonin levels in the brain.
 &HT;    It's only a matter of time before this type of intervention
becomes more sophisticated, and potentially more dangerous. While
behavioral interventions have the potential to alleviate much
suffering, such awesome power cannot be taken lightly.
 &HT;    What ethical choices will we make when we have the ability to
profoundly alter not only the heart but also the soul of man? How
far will we go in altering the ``natural'' tendencies of human
beings? What impact will this eventually have on the evolution of
our species?
 &HT;    These questions will have to be addressed in the future, when
partial (or total) brain replacement becomes as routine as hip
replacement today. As with all revolutionary scientific advances,
we will need to exercise great care before redefining human nature.
After all, we've come a long way in two million years, and in many
ways our nature remains as inscrutable as ever.

 By STEPHEN L. COHEN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The advertising message in a national magazine was enticing to
millions of women suffering the ravages of cellulite: take
Cellasene, ``a safe, natural, clinically-studied herbal
supplement'' and watch the cellulite melt away.
 &HT;    The ad promised women that they would ``look terrific'' -- with
healthier, smoother, firmer legs -- and went on to cite the
extensive media coverage of the product, as if the coverage itself
lent credibility to the claims.
 &HT;    ``You've seen it on Dateline, the Today Show and CNBC,'' the ad
proclaimed, boldly enlisting a sizable portion of the NBC
television network in its campaign.
 &HT;    It was an audacious marketing strategy, and the aggressive
tactics apparently worked. In Australia, desperate shoppers
practically rioted in order to get their hands on the product. In
Canada, the Cellasene distributor was quickly swamped with requests
for the herbal remedy. And when it arrived in the United States in
March, women lined up to join the frenzy. In a matter of months,
the product has generated U.S. sales of more than $5 million.
 &HT;    But is Cellasene really the miracle cure women having been
seeking for decades? Critics in the medical community have strongly
attacked the herbal supplement, pointing out that no published
research supports the extraordinary claims of the product
manufacturer. Though the ad campaign urges consumers to ``accept
only the clinically-researched formula'' of Cellasene, the research
has little credibility in scientific circles because it consists of
just three small studies -- none of which were published in a
peer-reviewed journal, or anywhere else for that matter.
 &HT;    The small size of the studies, which only examined 75 patients,
raises further questions regarding the product's efficacy. Medestea
Internazionale, the Italian manufacturer of Cellasene, claims that
it works by increasing the blood supply to the dimpled skin of the
thighs and buttocks seen with cellulite. But according to the
Laboratory of Human Behavior and Metabolism at Rockefeller
University, which has studied cellulite physiology, ``there is no
evidence of any primary role for blood flow'' in the development of
the condition.
 &HT;    Safety concerns have arisen as well. Cellasene, for example,
contains more than four times the U.S. Recommended Dietary
Allowance of iodine, a potent stimulant of the thyroid gland.
Excessive thyroid activity has been associated with multiple
complications, including tremors, weight loss, insomnia and
menstrual irregularity.
 &HT;    Despite the unproven benefits and potential for harm, Medestea
has successfully attracted many customers with the promise of a
cure for cellulite. The company claims that about 90 percent of
patients taking the product had reduced cellulite after eight
weeks. Of course, given the small sample of patients studied, that
represents only 54 people. But for women who have tried everything
to rid themselves of the unsightly lumps and bumps of cellulite,
Cellasene is like the Holy Grail.
 &HT;    For medical critics of the product, that is precisely the
problem: if herbal manufacturers are able to make dramatic,
unsubstantiated claims with impunity, they have enormous power to
generate consumer demand for their products -- without having to
worry about mundane details like safety or efficacy.
 &HT;    Rexall Sundown, the U.S. distributor of Cellasene, has already
been accused of impropriety regarding another product called Osteo
Bi-Flex. In June, the company agreed to alter the marketing of the
product after the Arthritis Foundation complained that it was
engaged in deceptive advertising. The foundation charged that the
ads misled consumers by creating the impression that it had
endorsed the unproven dietary supplement.
 &HT;    The problem of deceptive advertising may only get worse as the
use of herbal remedies grows in America. According to the
University of Washington Health Sciences Center, more than a third
of the population now relies on herbs to treat everything from
depression to migraines to AIDS. In 1997, the American Botanical
Council estimates that Americans spent about $4 billion on herbal
medicines.
 &HT;    Much of the growth of herbal medicine -- and herbal marketing --
can be traced to the passage of the Dietary Supplement Health and
Education Act in 1994. In passing this legislation, Congress paved
the way for herbal companies to peddle their products with little
oversight, and without any need to substantiate their claims,
however outlandish. Though companies are supposed to have data on
hand to support their claims, they do not need government approval
before marketing a product.
 &HT;    This has led to a curious paradox, in which many food
ingredients are closely regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, but food supplements -- like herbal remedies,
botanical extracts and amino acids -- are not. Unlike other new
food ingredients, for example, dietary supplements are no longer
subject to safety evaluations before being marketed.
 &HT;    Besides freeing manufacturers from any obligation to document
the safety or efficacy of their products, the 1994 legislation also
freed them from any responsibility to report adverse effects. This
has meant that no system exists to track potentially
life-threatening side effects of herbal medicines.
 &HT;    According to a recent report in the Archives of Family Medicine,
this could have serious ramifications. The report cites numerous
commonly-used herbs with potential toxic effects, including
Belladonna (which can cause respiratory depression) and Pokeroot
(which may be fatal in children).
 &HT;    It also notes that 25 percent of traditional drugs -- which are
regulated by the FDA -- have botanical origins, such as aspirin
from willow bark and tamoxifen from the Pacific yew tree. This
blurs the line between herbs and traditional drugs, further
weakening the case for making a legislative distinction between the
two kinds of remedies.
 &HT;    For now, the dietary supplement legislation leaves American
consumers subject to potentially misleading claims, worthless
remedies or dangerous adverse effects. The growing use of herbs has
significant economic implications as well. In the absence of
controlled clinical trials, herbal remedies may be usurping
billions of dollars that could be put to much better use in other
ways.

 By STEPHEN L. COHEN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The advertising message in a national magazine was enticing to
millions of women suffering the ravages of cellulite: take
Cellasene, ``a safe, natural, clinically-studied herbal
supplement'' and watch the cellulite melt away.
 &HT;    The ad promised women that they would ``look terrific'' -- with
healthier, smoother, firmer legs -- and went on to cite the
extensive media coverage of the product, as if the coverage itself
lent credibility to the claims.
 &HT;    ``You've seen it on Dateline, the Today Show and CNBC,'' the ad
proclaimed, boldly enlisting a sizable portion of the NBC
television network in its campaign.
 &HT;    It was an audacious marketing strategy, and the aggressive
tactics apparently worked. In Australia, desperate shoppers
practically rioted in order to get their hands on the product. In
Canada, the Cellasene distributor was quickly swamped with requests
for the herbal remedy. And when it arrived in the United States in
March, women lined up to join the frenzy. In a matter of months,
the product has generated U.S. sales of more than $5 million.
 &HT;    But is Cellasene really the miracle cure women having been
seeking for decades? Critics in the medical community have strongly
attacked the herbal supplement, pointing out that no published
research supports the extraordinary claims of the product
manufacturer. Though the ad campaign urges consumers to ``accept
only the clinically-researched formula'' of Cellasene, the research
has little credibility in scientific circles because it consists of
just three small studies -- none of which were published in a
peer-reviewed journal, or anywhere else for that matter.
 &HT;    The small size of the studies, which only examined 75 patients,
raises further questions regarding the product's efficacy. Medestea
Internazionale, the Italian manufacturer of Cellasene, claims that
it works by increasing the blood supply to the dimpled skin of the
thighs and buttocks seen with cellulite. But according to the
Laboratory of Human Behavior and Metabolism at Rockefeller
University, which has studied cellulite physiology, ``there is no
evidence of any primary role for blood flow'' in the development of
the condition.
 &HT;    Safety concerns have arisen as well. Cellasene, for example,
contains more than four times the U.S. Recommended Dietary
Allowance of iodine, a potent stimulant of the thyroid gland.
Excessive thyroid activity has been associated with multiple
complications, including tremors, weight loss, insomnia and
menstrual irregularity.
 &HT;    Despite the unproven benefits and potential for harm, Medestea
has successfully attracted many customers with the promise of a
cure for cellulite. The company claims that about 90 percent of
patients taking the product had reduced cellulite after eight
weeks. Of course, given the small sample of patients studied, that
represents only 54 people. But for women who have tried everything
to rid themselves of the unsightly lumps and bumps of cellulite,
Cellasene is like the Holy Grail.
 &HT;    For medical critics of the product, that is precisely the
problem: if herbal manufacturers are able to make dramatic,
unsubstantiated claims with impunity, they have enormous power to
generate consumer demand for their products -- without having to
worry about mundane details like safety or efficacy.
 &HT;    Rexall Sundown, the U.S. distributor of Cellasene, has already
been accused of impropriety regarding another product called Osteo
Bi-Flex. In June, the company agreed to alter the marketing of the
product after the Arthritis Foundation complained that it was
engaged in deceptive advertising. The foundation charged that the
ads misled consumers by creating the impression that it had
endorsed the unproven dietary supplement.
 &HT;    The problem of deceptive advertising may only get worse as the
use of herbal remedies grows in America. According to the
University of Washington Health Sciences Center, more than a third
of the population now relies on herbs to treat everything from
depression to migraines to AIDS. In 1997, the American Botanical
Council estimates that Americans spent about $4 billion on herbal
medicines.
 &HT;    Much of the growth of herbal medicine -- and herbal marketing --
can be traced to the passage of the Dietary Supplement Health and
Education Act in 1994. In passing this legislation, Congress paved
the way for herbal companies to peddle their products with little
oversight, and without any need to substantiate their claims,
however outlandish. Though companies are supposed to have data on
hand to support their claims, they do not need government approval
before marketing a product.
 &HT;    This has led to a curious paradox, in which many food
ingredients are closely regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, but food supplements -- like herbal remedies,
botanical extracts and amino acids -- are not. Unlike other new
food ingredients, for example, dietary supplements are no longer
subject to safety evaluations before being marketed.
 &HT;    Besides freeing manufacturers from any obligation to document
the safety or efficacy of their products, the 1994 legislation also
freed them from any responsibility to report adverse effects. This
has meant that no system exists to track potentially
life-threatening side effects of herbal medicines.
 &HT;    According to a recent report in the Archives of Family Medicine,
this could have serious ramifications. The report cites numerous
commonly-used herbs with potential toxic effects, including
Belladonna (which can cause respiratory depression) and Pokeroot
(which may be fatal in children).
 &HT;    It also notes that 25 percent of traditional drugs -- which are
regulated by the FDA -- have botanical origins, such as aspirin
from willow bark and tamoxifen from the Pacific yew tree. This
blurs the line between herbs and traditional drugs, further
weakening the case for making a legislative distinction between the
two kinds of remedies.
 &HT;    For now, the dietary supplement legislation leaves American
consumers subject to potentially misleading claims, worthless
remedies or dangerous adverse effects. The growing use of herbs has
significant economic implications as well. In the absence of
controlled clinical trials, herbal remedies may be usurping
billions of dollars that could be put to much better use in other
ways.

 (Repeating for Fort Worth; originally moved in 2 takes 12/23/99)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON - Senator John McCain says he doesn't wear his
religion on his sleeve, but a stirring testimonial to his Christian
faith is on the air in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   In a radio ad titled ``A Christmas Story,'' retired Air Force
Col. Bud Day says he will never forget being deeply touched by the
sermon McCain, his cellmate, composed for the servicemen in a
Vietnamese prison camp on Christmas night, 1971. ``It certainly was
a shot to everyone's morale to hear those Christian words in that
very un-Christianlike place,'' Day recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Governor George W. Bush publicly attests that Jesus
``changed my heart.'' Vice President Al Gore proudly declares he is
a born-again Christian.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes said on a TV news show last Sunday that Jesus
Christ is his savior. Senator Orrin Hatch, Gary Bauer, and Alan
Keyes profess that their faith in God is fundamental to who they
are and how they would lead the nation.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of political reasons why God Talk is so
prevalent in this presidential campaign. The candidates are trying
to show they are more virtuous than the man in the White House.
Tragedies like the murders at Columbine High School focus voters on
the country's perceived moral weaknesses. Constituencies of
conservative Christians have clout in next month's Iowa caucuses
and upcoming primaries in the South.
</P>
<P>
   But the unusual intensity and passion of the Christian rhetoric
in this campaign - which is disturbing to some, especially for its
sectarian edge - very likely springs as much from the candidates'
personal journeys of faith as it does from raw political
calculation, people close to them say.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, Gore, and Bauer, all Southerners who attend evangelical
churches, tell soulful, personal stories of times of trouble or
doubt that led them to commit to Jesus Christ. Even McCain and
Senator Bill Bradley, the two candidates who say the subject is too
private to discuss in their campaigns, write in their memoirs of
profound encounters with religion and spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   The cruelty and godlessness of the Hanoi prison camp where he
was held for more than five years, McCain wrote in ``Faith of My
Fathers,'' could have shattered his faith. Instead, McCain said, he
embraced the words of the creed that another prisoner had scratched
into the cell wall: ``I believe in God, the Father Almighty.
</P>
<P>
   ``There, standing witness to God's presence in a remote,
concealed place, I felt God's love and care more vividly than I
would have felt it had I been safe among a pious congregation in
the most magnificent cathedral,'' McCain wrote. In prison, the
once-cocky Naval aviator said he ``prayed more often and fervently
than I ever had as a free man,'' and his most sacred Christmases
were spent with the ``gaunt, unshaven, dirty, and generally
wretched congregation'' of fellow POWs.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was raised an Episcopalian, is married to a
Congregationalist, and now belongs to a Baptist church in Phoenix.
``We don't go to church every week, we aren't as fervent as we
should be,'' said Cindy McCain, the Arizona senator's spouse. ``But
John is a man of great faith and inspiration.'' Bush, McCain's
chief rival for the GOP nomination, has surprised aides with his
avowals of Christian faith. Ralph Reed, the former executive
director of the Christian Coalition and now an adviser to the Texas
governor, said he was ``taken aback'' when Bush, asked in a
televised debate in Iowa to name the philosopher or thinker who
most influenced him, answered, ``Christ, because he changed my
heart.'' ``He was so enthusiastic and expressive - it was like
somebody had read out his lottery ticket,'' said Reed, insisting
the answer was sincere and heartfelt, and not political. ``Bush's
faith commitment is real, and it brought stability, meaning, and an
extraordinary change to his life.'' Bush often relates how a walk
and conversation with evangelist Billy Graham at Bush's parents'
home in Kennebunkport, Maine, in 1985, started him on a journey to
renew his Christian faith, accept Jesus, and turn around a life of
too much partying and drinking. He went back to Texas, joined a
men's Bible study group, became active in an evangelical Methodist
church, began reading Scripture every day, and turned to prayer and
meditation. A few months later, he swore off alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had always been a religious person, had regularly attended
church, even taught Sunday school, and served as an altar boy,''
Bush wrote in his memoir, ``A Charge to Keep.'' ``But that weekend
my faith took on new meaning. It was the beginning of a walk where
I would recommit my heart to Jesus Christ.'' Bush, who went to
Presbyterian and Episcopal churches as a child, says his faith
teaches him humility and how to be a good husband and parent, and
he prays for patience and understanding. His political philosophy
of ``compassionate conservatism'' is rooted in his Christian
values, Bush says, and his proposal to provide federal aid and
grants to churches and faith-based charities and make them partners
in solving social problems grows out of what he, in the evangelical
tradition, calls the ``transforming power of faith.'' Vice
President Gore is also a proponent of creating partnerships between
faith-based groups and federal programs; he has what Reed says is
the same uniquely Southern trait of speaking with fluency and
emotion about his religion; and he, too, says he was born again in
Jesus. In his junior year at Harvard, Gore says, ``I felt a
transformational relationship with my own interpretation of God,
and Christ in God.'' Gore's evangelical journey started in the
revival tents of Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Unsettled by his service in Vietnam, Gore's next stop was the
liberal Vanderbilt Divinity School for a year of spiritual
searching. As adults, Gore and his wife, Tipper, were baptized in a
Southern Baptist church outside Washington. Later, his faith was
tested when his only sister died of lung cancer and his son,
Albert, was nearly killed in a car accident.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview on ``60 Minutes,'' Gore said he's not
embarrassed to talk of his faith (in fact, he regularly sprinkles
his speeches with Biblical imagery, passages of Scripture, and
quotes from Mother Teresa), even when some intellectuals disdain
it. ``It's the core of my life,'' he said. ``It's the foundation of
my other beliefs, my political philosophy.'' The Rev. K. Bruce
Miller, pastor of Mt. Vernon Baptist Church, where Gore worships,
believes Gore's promises to aid the poor and protect the
environment are Bible-based. ``Psalm 24 - `the earth is the Lord's,
and the fullness thereof' - says we don't own this place,'' Miller
said. ``When Al Gore talks about stewardship, I believe he is
serious about trying to do God's will.'' Republicans Bauer, Forbes,
Keyes, and Hatch make Christian values central to their policy
agendas, and the debate in Iowa earlier this month illustrated it:
Keyes, a Roman Catholic, said that as president, he would push
school prayer and preserve family farms. Forbes, an Episcopalian,
endorsed vouchers to help parents pay for parochial-school tuition,
and he called for a spiritual renewal in America. Bauer, who
belongs to an evangelical Bible church, wants students taught
creationism and God-fearing judges appointed to the federal bench.
All of them, including Hatch, a Mormon, say abortion violates God's
law.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, when his main issue was the flat tax, Forbes
didn't reveal much about his personal life, including his faith.
Today, says the wealthy publisher and now-vocal abortion opponent,
it's essential information for voters trying to gauge the depth,
honesty, and morality of a future president.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was growing up, religion was an ever-present part of
our lives, low-key perhaps, but there on a daily basis,'' said
Forbes. ``I do believe that Jesus Christ is my Lord and savior. And
I believe God created the world.'' His most prayerful times, Forbes
recalls, were when his mother was dying of lung cancer and two of
his daughters were born prematurely. What he prays for, Forbes said
in a telephone call from South Carolina, is ``private, kept between
me and my God.'' Bauer, the former head of the Family Research
Council and the candidate most openly wooing the Christian
conservatives, grew up in a non-Christian home in Newport, Ky., was
guided to church by a devout grandmother, committed himself to
Jesus as a teenager, and was baptized beside his father, an
alcoholic whose faith helped him stay sober for long periods of
time. Bauer says he believes in heavenly miracles because ``for a
janitor's son to end up as a candidate for president is, in its own
way, something of a miracle.'' At home, the Bauers practice what
their fundamentalist church preaches.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer's wife, Carol, belongs to Mothers in Touch, a group that
prays for public schools, teachers, and troubled children. Both of
Bauer's college-age daughters have committed to chastity until
marriage. Bauer is a Promise Keeper and has attended events
sponsored by the Christian men's group.
</P>
<P>
   In the Iowa debate, Bauer and Hatch joined the hallelujah
chorus, citing Jesus Christ as the historic figure they most
admire. But Keyes, who has made moral conviction the keystone of
his candidacy, said he found it ``shocking'' for Bush to reduce
Jesus to the secular status of a philosopher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't admire Christ. I worship him,'' Keyes said on
``Crossfire.'' ``He is the living son of the living God, and he
doesn't influence my mind. He shapes, guides, and commands that
mind, because he is the sovereign of my will. Jesus Christ was not
a `thinker.' He was the word itself.'' As a Mormon, Hatch says the
way he lives says more about his love for Jesus than any
testimonial. He doesn't smoke or drink, he composes inspirational
music, and reads at least 10 pages of the Bible a day. The Utah
Republican became a committed Christian at 17, and from age 20 to
22 spent ``the most important two years of my life'' as a church
missionary in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Bradley, no kin to Hatch in political ideology, at one
time shared a similar missionary zeal. His mother, an ardent
Methodist, ordered him to Sunday school, took him to revivals, and
sent him to a summer camp for Christian athletes. Moved by the
proselytizing of Fran Tarkenton and other sports idols, the young
Bradley was soon giving sermons himself and writing about his faith
in Jesus in evangelical journals.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Time Present, Time Past,'' his memoir, Bradley casts doubt
on whether he was truly born again when he made a bargain with God
as a struggling freshman at Princeton: get him through his first
year, Bradley prayed, and he would pay the Lord back. ``I had
convinced myself that this was my `personal experience' with
Jesus,'' wrote Bradley, a former New Jersey senator and pro
basketball star.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, Bradley broke faith with his fundamentalism because, he
said, it was intolerant of debate and insensitive to civil rights.
As a Rhodes scholar, he took part in Billy Graham's crusade in
London but felt himself falling away. At an Oxford church, he was
offended by a preacher defending white rule in the former Rhodesia.
``I walked out, never to return,'' Bradley wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley says in his book that he now ``seeks my own individual
faith.'' In his campaign, he refuses to discuss his religion,
calling it ``an extremely private matter,'' adding that he respects
his rivals for their openness and ``I hope they respect me.'' The
Rev. C. Weldon Gaddy, executive director of the Interfaith
Alliance, says that as long as religion doesn't become the primary
qualification for the presidency, it's healthy for the candidates
to make it part of their profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``The watchword is caution,'' said Gaddy, a Baptist minister
whose group includes Christian, Jewish, and Muslim clergy and was
formed as a political counterweight to the Christian Coalition.
``My greatest fear is that declarations about Jesus somehow become
a substitute for discussing political and social issues.'' Secular
groups, such as Americans United for the Separation of Church and
State, have accused candidates of pious pandering and competing to
be national preacher rather than president of a pluralistic nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why all this wringing of hands, for crying out loud,'' said
Michael Cromartie, director of the Evangelical Studies Project at
the nonprofit Ethics and Policy Center. ``Not one of these men is
saying, `I have Christ in my heart, therefore I will create a
theocracy.' They know we live in a pluralistic society, but they
are also sincere in their faith.''

   ROME _ So where do you suppose Rome's hottest restaurant is? In
an ancient palazzo? On some picturesque piazza? Along the Tiber?
Nah. It's in the Cavalieri Hilton Hotel _ yes, ma'am, the Hilton _
on a mountaintop in the residential suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   And who do you suppose the chef is? A Roman native? A Venetian
or Neapolitan, perhaps? Not on your life. He's a German named
Heinz.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally something of a gastronomic cul-de-sac compared
with Milan or even Tuscany, Rome has begun embracing fresh culinary
ideas. This is evolution, not revolution, of course. Rome respects
its traditions; they are thousands of years old, and it modifies
them only very reluctantly.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is clear evidence of the change in the Eternal City's
outlook in the fact that La Pergola, Heinz Beck's restaurant
overlooking St. Peter's dome from a perch high on Monte Mario, is
regarded by many local critics as Rome's best. After a
scintillating meal there on Christmas, identifiably Italian but
also thoroughly international, using favorite Roman ingredients
like artichokes, eggplant and lamb in enticing new ways, I have
joined the Beck fan club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rome has opened a new era,'' said Beck, 36, who once was a
sous-chef at Heinz Winkler, one of Germany's superstars. ``It is
coming closer to the top restaurants in Italy and in Europe,
without losing its special charm. Romans are geniuses in the
kitchen, but if you don't push them, they'd rather relax and enjoy
themselves. Now there are enough first-rate places so every chef
knows what it takes to make the list.''
</P>
<P>
   Agata e Romeo, another of the stars of this new cucina creativa,
offers its own lighter versions of the hearty meat dishes that
Romans, unlike their fish-loving cousins farther south, have long
preferred. But it also serves a stunning if improbable first-course
salad of mache and thinly sliced smoked sturgeon that would make
Barney Greengrass himself sit up and take notice, to say nothing of
a memorably delicate onion pudding, topped with slivers of ginger,
alongside a scallop of sauteed foie gras.
</P>
<P>
   At Il Convivio, newly installed in brighter, more spacious
quarters near the Piazza Navona, Angelo Troiani, a young chef, puts
real punch into things like rack of lamb with a boldly mustardy
crust, and kidneys with Jerusalem artichokes and quail in a
mint-spiked sauce, an inspired pairing.
</P>
<P>
   Antico Arco, a hangout for the young and hip on the Janiculum
Hill, above Trastevere, mixes sweet and savory, a technique dating
back to the days of Caesar, in intriguing new ways. Fennel flan
with orange sauce is an example, as is rabbit salad with Parmesan
flakes and a touch of honey. At least 30 wines are offered by the
glass, which is unusual for Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Simpler places find other ways to stand out from the crowd. At
Myosotis (the name is Latin for forget-me-not), you remember the
warm focaccia served with a slice of handmade salami, and the
golden chunks of rosemary-scented roast lamb. But in a city of
indifferent waiters, it is this restaurant's efficient service,
suffused with warmth, that sets it apart, plus the oceans of
terrific wine on its list, especially from Tuscany.
</P>
<P>
   Even at the best places, not all of the innovations work. You
can find madness posing as creativity at trattorias all over town,
and some dishes at a fusion restaurant called 'Gusto _ like
spaghetti cooked in a wok, say, or tagliolini with asparagus and
star anise _ make you wonder. Not every Roman architect is a
Bernini or Borromini, nor every chef a genius.
</P>
<P>
   But on the whole, the city's restaurants, like the city itself,
are on a roll. For the Jubilee Year, which will culminate in the
2,000th anniversary of the traditional birthday of Christ, the
Forum has been floodlit, the Borghese Gallery has been reopened
after 13 years, the unmatched Ludovisi collection of ancient
sculpture has re-emerged from packing cases after six decades,
another array of sculpture has been dazzlingly installed in an old
electrical generating plant, the architect Gae Aulenti has
renovated the old papal stables to house temporary exhibitions, St.
Peter's and the Fountain of Trevi have been scrubbed spotless _ and
those who visit Rome on spiritual or artistic pilgrimages will find
plenty of intriguing places to eat.
</P>
<P>
   A few are old-timers. Not many restaurants anywhere as
unfailingly fulfill a promise of tradition and quality as Checchino
dal 1887. Checchino (pronounced kek-EE-no), located across the
street from the old Testaccio slaughterhouses, specializes in what
the Romans call the ``fifth quarter'' of the steer and the pig _
the parts left for the poor after the steaks and chops and roasts
have been sold to the rich. So things like coda all vaccinara,
oxtail braised in a tomato-based sauce for five hours, and testina,
a sort of head cheese, sliced ultra-thin, and pajata, intestines of
milk-fed veal used in a rich pasta sauce, emerge from this kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   The squeamish need not shy away from Checchino's plain, almost
austere dining room, with its caramel-colored wainscoting. Another
specialty is stewed abbacchio, or lamb, sweet and mild in spring,
gamier in winter, served with a salad of delectably crunchy greens
called puntarelle.
</P>
<P>
   But like restaurateurs elsewhere, some in Rome are starting to
realize that customers want less elaborate meals, freed from the
rigid Italian format of antipasto, then pasta, main course and
fruit or dessert.
</P>
<P>
   Massimo Riccioli, the chef and owner of La Rosetta, Rome's best
fish restaurant for decades, has opened a tiny spot in a forgotten
courtyard near Myosotis, Convivio and the Pantheon to give Romans
precisely that. At Riccioli Cafe, which is furnished with
square-top tables in shiny primary colors, you can order sashimi or
marinated fish made from the same prime Mediterranean specimens
used at Rosetta, including the red tuna belly meat that the
Japanese call maguro and the Italians call ventresca di tonno. Or
try a half-dozen sparklingly fresh Belon oysters. There are dozens
of choice bottles from all over the place to go with them, and the
cafe stays open until 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Just off the Campo de Fiori, at Al Bric, Roberto Marchetti
emphasizes cheese, which is displayed in the window, and wine,
which lines the lobby. You can order a meal or just a drink and a
nibble _ pecorino aged in a cave, for example, or a European Union
blue-cheese sampler including Stilton, Gorgonzola and Roquefort. Al
Bric was closed the day that my wife, Betsey, and I stopped by, but
our friends Nicholas Lander, the restaurant critic for The
Financial Times in London, and his wife, Jancis Robinson, the wine
writer, vouch for its excellence.

&HT;     SOME FUND-RAISERS COME UP SHORT FOR CHARITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ When KPFA Pacifica Radio hired a private
company to solicit donations last year, listeners responded and
sent checks worth $38,148 for the Berkeley station. But how much
did the station actually make from this telephone fund-raising
drive?
</P>
<P>
   $96.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts-based company that raised money for the
station charged a fee of $38,052, sucking up nearly all of the
donations from the one-time-only drive in early 1998. One-quarter
of 1 percent of the money raised went to the public radio station
in that particular drive.
</P>
<P>
   Although situations like this are rare, a report released Monday
by California Attorney General Bill Lockyer says that some
charities are getting less than half what is raised by the
professionals they hire to solicit donations. Of the $196 million
raised in 1998 by private fund-raising operations, $85.8 million _
43.7 percent _ reached charities, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``While not true for all, most of the money raised by these
enterprises went to solicit expenses and fund-raiser profits,
rather than the charity that hired them,`` Lockyer said.
</P>
<P>
   A commercial fund-raising operation usually charges a fee or a
percentage of the money raised during the drive. In exchange, the
company hires its own phone solicitors, prints query letters and
brochures and often collects the money. Of the 81,000 charities in
California that raised $62 billion last year, only 5 percent used
commercial fund-raising operations. Others did it themselves,
usually with volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Lockyer said about 10 commercial fund-raising companies were
under investigation by his office for possible fraud, and about 100
charities also faced scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   For nonprofit groups and charities that hire commercial
fund-raisers, the fees and expenses can eat up great portions of
the profits. Some commercial operations charge for rent, permits,
telephones, taxes, utilities, security, even maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lockyer's report, there were 544 commercial
fund-raising campaigns in California in 1998. Only 29 percent of
those campaigns turned over 50 percent of their money to charities.
About 27 percent gave 15 percent or less to the charities, and 23
operations gave nothing to the intended charity.
</P>
<P>
   One of the largest fund-raising drives in 1998 came on behalf of
the California Police Activities League, an Oakland-based group
that supports community events, often for children. Telcom Services
Inc., with offices in California and Texas, raised $8.4 million for
the group, but ate up $5.9 million _ leaving the police
organization with about 29 percent of the money raised.
</P>
<P>
   Where did the money go? Among the expenses Telcom Services
charged were a blanket $3.4 million fee, $1.6 million in salaries,
$267,000 for postage, and $315,000 in other expenses such as rent,
bank charges, printing and supplies, according to a financial
report the company filed with the attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Peyton, president of Telcom Services, said he did not
want to talk about the specifics of the contract without reviewing
the documents from the attorney general. He did not return a
subsequent phone call.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to KPFA-FM and its fund-raising company, the Share Group
Inc. of Somerville, Mass., also were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Other operations were more successful than Telcom. A small San
Francisco company, Laura Talmus Associates, raised money in 1998
for the Union of Hebrew Congregations, the World Affairs Council
and others. Between 90 and 95 percent of the money raised by Talmus
went to the charities, among the highest percentages in the state.
The World Affairs Council, for example, paid Talmus a $16,000 fee
and about $1,300 for postage and phone use.
</P>
<P>
   They got back $291,250 in donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just do flat fees, and basically I just get hired for a
fixed period of time. There are no strings attached,`` Laura Talmus
said. ``The fact of the matter is I've got a small firm, and I have
real quality clients that are both political and nonprofit. I'm
very fussy about the clients I take on.``
</P>
<P>
   One Talmus operation was a bust. The company charged the Haight
Ashbury Medical Clinics in San Francisco $36,000 to raise money for
a new building in 1998. They ended up collecting only $32,626, a
$4,400 loss for the clinics. Talmus said she had voluntarily
returned her final month's fee because of it.

 ROME: its excellence.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This seems a good time to stress the need for reservations in
Rome. Many good spots are small, and we got into a couple only
through the wiles of Maurizio Pangrazi, the Hotel Eden's remarkable
head concierge.
</P>
<P>
   Agata e Romeo, located off the beaten track near Santa Maria
Maggiore, is a mom-and-pop operation where one wall is decorated
with a teapot collection. Agata Parisella cooks and her Naples-born
husband, Romeo Caraccio, takes your order. A fan of little wines as
well as big ones, he served us an aristocratic Barolo and a brash
young Campanian red. We were particularly impressed with cavaletti,
house-made pasta tubes, dressed with tart, partially pureed
broccoletti, one of many unusual brassicas that flourish in
southern Italy, and a bit of sausage; with meltingly tender veal
cheeks, Betsey's main course, and nuggets of boar, my choice; and
with Caraccio's own pecorino cheese, whose sharp, salty flavor was
offset by figs in honey and home-baked bread studded with dried
fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Agata e Romeo is Beck's favorite restaurant in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   But Beck's is mine. For me, La Pergola is in a class by itself.
It has a star in the Michelin guide; surely it will have two before
very long. The Hilton management has provided Beck with all that
any chef could ask for: a gracious, polylingual staff, a view that
would have mesmerized Canaletto and the kind of decor _ a swirl of
silver, silk, mahogany and mirrors _ that marks luxury restaurants
in Paris and northern Italy.
</P>
<P>
   With an all-Italian team in the kitchen, Beck cooks only for La
Pergola, and not for the hotel's other restaurants or room service.
He cooks only five nights a week and only at dinner, for roughly 50
clients.
</P>
<P>
   Short and slight, a taut if boyish perfectionist, he has not
missed a single night's work in the five years since La Pergola
opened. When he came down with pneumonia last fall, he took a room
at the hotel to conserve his energy instead of returning home every
night, but still he cooked.
</P>
<P>
   Beck's holiday menu opened with a half-dozen pre-appetizers,
with house-made bread sticks the diameter of a wooden match, and a
bright green, nonalcoholic cocktail of liquified arugula and lemon
sherbet that delighted the eye while whetting the appetite. A
savory smoothie, you might say.
</P>
<P>
   There followed a half-dozen courses, each remarkable in its own
way, whether for the richness of the capon broth in a traditional
Italian Christmas soup, cappelletti in brodo, or the soft-boiled
quail eggs and artichoke chips in a salad that included slices of
black truffles and pomegranate seeds.
</P>
<P>
   One of two fish dishes, combining a gamy strip of red mullet
with sweet caramelized leeks and spicy, woodsy-tasting little
chanterelle mushrooms, was packed with gutsy, almost meaty appeal;
I thought I detected a hint of cardamom. The other was all
Mediterranean delicacy _ a slice of Sardinian spiny lobster resting
on an astonishingly smooth puree of eggplant, surrounded by tiny
pools of basil oil and humps of chopped tomato. Each, taken by
itself, was delicious, but the contrast made the menu sing.

THE END IS NEAR. WHAT'S FOR DINNER? 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Recipe at end of story.) 
(DW) 
 By LISA ZEIDNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If I had a day left to live, I don't think I'd want to spend it
eating. Conceptually, unless the prospect of imminent death
rendered me too edgy and distracted, I would prefer to have a
prodigious amount of sex. If such activity required a sports energy
bar, so be it. But I'm not sure I'd want to sit down for the final
feast that Roland Passot, the chef at La Folie in San Francisco,
describes to James L. Dickerson for ``Last Suppers: If the World
Ended Tomorrow, What Would Be Your Last Meal?'' (Lebhar Friedman
Books, $24.95).
</P>
<P>
   Passot envisions seven courses, including a napoleon of seared
Cape Cod sea scallops with Yukon Gold potatoes, winter truffles and
an asparagus emulsion, and roasted Canadian venison with a potato,
leek and prune ``gateau,'' in sauce poivrade with Scharffen Berger
chocolate essence.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, Passot already knows who or what Scharffen Berger
is, and thus would not have to spend his last day on earth being
lectured by a waiter. He would need only to process meat in
chocolate sauce, and if you plan to be dead, acid indigestion might
become a less burning concern.
</P>
<P>
   He's a chef, so it's not terribly surprising that he would knock
himself out. Bill Clinton would choose chicken enchiladas. Mike
Ditka would have pigs in a blanket, and John Elway would gorge on
hamburger soup. Vanna White claims she would go to her grave with a
bellyful of cottage cheese salad, for which she even provides a
recipe (Cool Whip, lime Jell-O).
</P>
<P>
   The enticingly high-concept notion for ``Last Suppers'' is that,
in choosing our foodstuffs, we reveal something about who we are
and how we think we have lived. It's sort of like envisioning what
you'd pack with yourself in the pyramid if you were a Pharaoh. Or
like making a time capsule out of your tummy for the forensic folk.
</P>
<P>
   Besides a section of recipes and guest lists from chefs and what
Dickerson generously calls celebrities (be forewarned that except
Clinton, most are on the level of renown of the Amazing Kreskin,
``World's Foremost Mentalist''), we're treated to the actual last
meals of 14 deceased celebrities. Possibly two of them knew that
they were going to die. For dinner, Ernest Hemingway ate his usual
steak and potatoes at his usual restaurant. Marilyn Monroe,
``cultural icon,'' who had been stood up by her lunch date in Los
Angeles, ate guacamole and spicy meatballs at a Mexican buffet,
chasing it with Champagne.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the deceased were surprised by death or died in
their sleep. It's a stretch to call James Thurber's bedtime sip of
brandy or Elvis' 4 a.m. munchies of ice cream and cookies last
suppers. If John Lennon knew what lay in wait, would he have chosen
a corned beef sandwich?
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson admits that most foodstuffs eaten by the deceased were
``hastily prepared meals taken on the run.'' He adds,
``Unfortunately, most of us will never really have a last meal'' _
knowingly, at least. The exceptions, of course, are death row
prisoners. While he doesn't credit it, Dickerson may have gotten
his information on last meals in prison from Richard K. Nongard's
eerie, moving ``Final Words: Parting Thoughts and Last Meals From
Death Row'' (Peachtree Professional Education, 1997). A meal, in
that context, is the only route to some kind of aesthetic pleasure
or comfort _ prisoners are rarely sprung to watch sunsets with
their loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of those polled for this book chose foods that
reminded them of childhood _ Mama's fried chicken, goulash from the
old country. This is perfectly sensible. There's a difference,
however, between making a date with one's own personal maker and
envisioning the world's ending, per the book's title. It is
interesting to contemplate (as Dickerson does not) whether doomsday
demands something ceremonial, and if so, whether there is any
timeless, universal meal we could all agree on. It would probably
involve pasta (Hitler's choice in the bunker) and wine, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last Suppers'' is, I recognize, a lark, and thus Dickerson
can't be expected to deliver anthropological insight on the role of
food in civilization, but it's a shame we don't have a slightly
larger historical and geographical canvas here.
</P>
<P>
   In planning my own Y2K repast, it would be useful to know what
the generals ate before D-Day. I would like to know what provisions
were sent up the mountain with the Inca girls slated for sacrifice.
What is the menu of choice for kamikaze pilots? All mammothly
morbid, to be sure, but a millennium can do that to you.
</P>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sam Aaron, who died in 1996, was a founder of the
Sherry-Lehmann shop in New York and probably the greatest wine
salesmen I've known. He could have sold Bordeaux to the
Burgundians. Whatever he was flogging at the moment, he would add
this to his catalog: ``When this is gone there will be no more.''
The Rothschilds' best or Romanian plonk, it didn't matter: The
people came, waving money, demanding one of those precious last
bottles. He was a master of the fine art of creating demand.
</P>
<P>
   I thought of him the other day while pricing champagne. I had
another merchant's price list in hand, and at first I thought there
had been some mistake. The fellow was putting champagne on sale.
Could he have reissued last year's list in error? Everyone knows
there is a terrible shortage of champagne, what with the millennium
and all, but here was Piper-Heidsieck Brut, regularly $20.99, now
$19.99, and Henri Abele Brut, regularly $17.99, now $14.99.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen bucks for a bottle of champagne? Just days before the
New Year's Eve to end all New Year's Eves?
</P>
<P>
   I made a few more calls and quickly found Dom Perignon, which
allegedly is on allocation even in normal times, at $119.99 for the
1992 vintage. Minutes later, I found it at $99.99. Bollinger
Special Cuvee, which I had only days earlier been told was as rare
as the 1947 De Soto, could be had for $29.99.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers were sobbing into their Evian six months ago at the
prospect of having to disappoint so many loyal champagne customers
at year's end. So why is Abele Brut selling for less than some
bottles of Beaujolais?
</P>
<P>
   As Aaron might have predicted, all those doomsayers have helped
build a banner year for champagne. At Sherry-Lehmann, the chairman,
Michael Aaron, Sam's nephew, said champagne sales to date were 60
percent higher than last year's. The fact that so many restaurants
are closing for New Year's Eve means that even more champagne will
be drunk at home, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But champagne, in spite of its carefully cultivated luxury
image, is a mass-market product. Annual production in recent years
has been around 270 million bottles. This year, thanks to both
millennium celebrations and widespread affluence in Europe and the
United States, production is expected to reach some 325 million
bottles, or about 27 million cases.
</P>
<P>
   There are some 19,000 grape growers in the champagne region, of
whom more than 5,000 sell champagne under their own names. There
are 261 champagne ``houses'' allowed to purchase all their grapes
if they choose to, and 44 cooperatives selling under more than 200
brand names. Competition is, to put it mildly, fierce.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, many larger houses and cooperatives and even some
grower-producers have three, four or more years of reserve stocks
in the chalk caves that extend for miles under the champagne
countryside. They may deplete their stocks in a particularly good
year, but ever running out of wine is most unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Prestige cuvees, top-of-the-line labels like Bollinger's R.D.
(for Recently Disgorged), Roederer Cristal, Krug's Grande Annee,
Veuve Clicquot's Grande Dame and Laurent-Perrier's Grand Siecle may
be in short supply now, but the best-known of all the prestige
cuvees, Dom Perignon, seems to be readily available and at most
reasonable prices.
</P>
<P>
   At least some of the prestige cuvee currently being sold in this
country seems to be coming from the gray market, that is, outside
normal distribution channels. Dom Perignon has always been popular
on the gray market because it is well known and widely distributed
around the world. When the market is tight in this country,
allocations for other countries often find their way here.

   Some importers, taking the threat of shortages seriously,
arranged alternate sources early on. By September, when business
began to pick up after the summer months, restaurant clients
discovered a wealth of unfamiliar champagne names on wine lists. I
found two I enjoy in France _ Bonnaire, from Cramant, and Brugnon,
from Ecueil, both good champagnes _ good enough to put the
better-known names on notice that they could be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Most champagne drinkers are unaware of the ``sur lattes''
practice in champagne, which allows a major house to buy and add
its own label to wine already aged and bottled by someone else. I
know a grower-producer in a small town near Epernay who at one
point was making about 80,000 bottles of wine a year: 40,000 for
his own label, 40,000 for champagne Mumm. (Lattes are thin strips
of wood laid between filled bottles being shipped from one source
to another.)
</P>
<P>
   A good nonvintage champagne is a blend from different vineyards
and from different vintages. It is not unusual for these nonvintage
champagnes to include wines from 10 or 15 previous harvests. The
older wines add depth and character to the finished product. They
are what enables the winemaker to produce a unique house style
every year. Originally, champagne producers concentrated on their
nonvintage blends. These were the showcase wines that enabled the
winemakers not only to preserve the house style but also to display
their own skills. Vintage wines, using the grapes from a single
harvest, were produced in certain years to take advantage of
exceptionally good fruit. But they were not necessarily considered
to be the firm's best wines.
</P>
<P>
   Now, because of the emphasis on vintages in the still-wine
market, and the belief that vintage wines are always the best,
champagne producers try to make as many vintage wines as they can.
</P>
<P>
   Are they better than the nonvintage wines? They cost more _ but
at least one famous house doesn't think they are superior.
champagne Krug produces vintage wines as often as everyone else in
champagne but considers its top line to be its Grande Cuvee, a
blend of as many as 50 different wines from 25 different villages
and reserves from up to 10 different years.
</P>
<P>
   Once, California sparkling wines were easy to recognize in blind
tastings with their counterparts from champagne. Because the
sparkling wine business in California is relatively new, at least
at the prestige level, the finished products have often lacked the
depth and subtlety provided by older reserve wines. No longer. The
producers have had time to build up reserves, and as a consequence,
the quality of California sparklers, along with a few from Oregon,
has risen greatly in recent years. Wines from Schramsberg,
Roederer, Taittinger in California and from Argyle in Oregon come
to mind. They rarely reach the quality level of the best prestige
cuvees from France, but they almost certainly ease the demand for
the more commercial levels of champagne.
</P>
<P>
   True champagne from France accounts for only about 10 percent of
world sparkling wine consumption, and the champagne producers wage
a constant battle to be perceived as the best as American
competition gets stiffer each year.
</P>
<P>
   But French champagne is still the standard, and whether you plan
to toast the new year, century and millennium at home or on the
town, you can do it with good champagne at (mostly) sensible
prices.

A THOUSAND YEARS OF DINING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM GRIMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   No matter which way you slice the last millennium, a thousand
years adds up to a lot of meals. Some were more memorable than
others. For a majority of the human race, the challenge for most of
the last 10 centuries was not eating well, but merely eating. Thin
soup with a few vegetables was the plat du jour for the mass of
humankind, but even for the lucky ones who could count on three
meals every day, dining rarely deserved much notice, judging by the
written record.
</P>
<P>
   Only rarely does food break through to history's front page, but
through the current millennium, it has been the pivot point for
encounters and events _ some actual, some fictional _ that have
resonated down the corridors of time. Not many people can explain
the causes of the Franco-Prussian War, but nearly everyone feels
the power of Proust's madeleine. The economics of Plymouth Colony
feel remote, but the great dinner that became Thanksgiving lives
on, a central fact of American life.
</P>
<P>
   It would be foolish to try to name the greatest meals of the
last thousand years. The historical record is too spotty. But it is
possible to isolate a dozen moments that, for various reasons,
still grip the imagination, define the human experience or seem, in
retrospect, brimming with implication for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Fusion is as old as the first European traveler to come back
from the Middle East with a bagful of spices. Trendy restaurants
have existed since the first French chefs, thrown out of work when
the revolution erased the ancien regime, came up with the idea of
hanging out a shingle and printing up a menu. Nouvelle cuisine, in
the narrow sense, is a creation of the 1970s, but what could be
more nouvelle than the movement codified in the writings of La
Varenne and the other giants who developed haute cuisine?
</P>
<P>
   If a tour of the last 1,000 years of eating feels eerily
familiar, perhaps that's because styles change, but human appetite
and behavior remain as fixed as the North Star.
</P>
<P>
   1191: Slush in the Desert
</P>
<P>
   During the Third Crusade, the Christian army, commanded by
Richard the Lion-Hearted, presses within a few miles of Jerusalem
and defeats the Saracens at Arsuf. It is hot. As a form of tribute,
Richard's adversary, the great Saladin, sends him a cold treat, all
the more startling given the desert setting. History's soft-focus
lens obscures the dish. It is either a bowl of sherbet or a
sharbat, a drink of rose water chilled with snow collected from the
mountains of Lebanon. Either way, it is one of the first, and
greatest, examples of East-West culinary exchange, and a seminal
moment in the grand tradition of frozen desserts, one of the most
universal of all foods. The Arabic word becomes the French
``sorbet'' and the Italian ``sorbetto.'' The offspring of that
Lebanese slush include the 7-Eleven Slurpee and ice cream in every
form, from vanilla to jalapeno.
</P>
<P>
   Richard gets the dessert but fails to capture Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   1280: West Meets, and Eats, East
</P>
<P>
   Marco Polo, traveling through the Mongol empire, becomes the
first European to develop a fascination with Chinese cuisine, and
as such, should be considered the patron saint of Sunday dim sum,
if not the West's first foodie. In the city of Hangchow, he finds
restaurants specializing in blood soup, others that specialize in
dishes made from organ meat and others that serve vegetarian
Buddhist temple food. To give an idea of the vast quantities of
food consumed in Hangchow, he calculates the amount of pepper
consumed every day and comes up with a figure of 43 cartloads, a
cartload equaling 223 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing gives him pause. In the same deadpan prose used to
describe men with tails, he reports on the Tatar custom of mincing
up raw beef or horsemeat and mixing it with onions and garlic. The
dish has ever since been known as steak tartare. Contrary to
legend, Polo does not bring back noodles to Italy. But takeout food
in white cardboard cartons eventually spreads throughout the West.
</P>
<P>
   1518: One Fat Englishman
</P>
<P>
   In a single day of feasting, Henry VIII and his courtiers
consume 11 beef carcasses, 6 sheep, 17 hogs and pigs, 45 dozen
chickens, 15 swans, 6 cranes, 384 pigeons, 648 larks, 72 geese and
4 peacocks; the meat is flavored by 3,000 pears and 1,300 apples.
Three thousand loaves of bread and 400 dishes of butter are also
consumed. It is a substantial meal. By 1541, Henry's waist will
expand from 37 inches to 57 inches.
</P>
<P>
   In the age of exploration and mercantile globe-gobbling, Henry
stands supreme as a symbol of unbridled appetite, with an
insatiable hunger _ for power, for women, for gambling and for
food. He is, without question, the man who ate everything. The
image will become indelible when Charles Laughton portrays him on
film seated at a banquet table and waving a giant leg of lamb in
the air.
</P>
<P>
   1549: Paris Fiorentina
</P>
<P>
   On June 16, Catherine de' Medici formally enters Paris as the
bride of Henry II. The ensuing celebrations include a feast
organized around birds, including 30 peacocks, 21 swans, 9 cranes,
66 herons and 33 egrets, along with smaller birds, hares and
rabbits. As a display of the city's power as a culinary center, the
meal is unrivaled, reflecting the highly developed system of
markets and specialized guilds and the wealth of ingredients that
will soon give rise to haute cuisine. French ascendancy throughout
much of the world will last nearly to the end of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine, a Florentine, will also touch off one of the
longest-running controversies in food history. Her retinue includes
Italian cooks, pastry makers, confectioners and distillers, and in
her baggage are such novel ingredients as artichokes and parsley.
With time, it becomes accepted that Italy (or, as Diderot's
Encyclopedia put it, ``that crowd of corrupt Italians who served at
the court of Catherine de' Medici'') taught France to cast off
heavily spiced, sweet-and-sour medieval cooking and to develop the
more refined, complex principles of haute cuisine. The Oxford
Companion to Food relegates the theory to an article titled
``Culinary Mythology.'' Italian scholars refuse to budge.
</P>
<P>
   1621: New American Cuisine
</P>
<P>
   Sometime between Sept. 21 and Nov. 9, the Pilgrims of Plymouth
Colony sit down to dinner with Chief Massasoit and 99 braves from
the Wampanoag tribe to celebrate the first harvest. Fowl are
served, although it is not now clear that turkey was on the menu.
Other dishes, many of them provided by the Indians, are oysters,
eel, corn bread, goose, venison, watercress, leeks, berries and
plums. The Indians also bring popcorn, thereby initiating a
longstanding American tradition of taking food to potluck dinners
that costs virtually nothing but takes up a lot of space. Despite
the absence of football games on television, the dinner goes
smoothly. At the second Thanksgiving, in 1623, turkey, pumpkin pie
and cranberries gain a place on the menu and never leave it. The
multiethnic origins of the feast will later inspire
Southwestern-style stuffings, Afrocentric side dishes and Asian
glazes. In any language, it will translate into leftovers that
achieve deep levels of obscurity in the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   1671: Chef en Brochette
</P>
<P>
   On April 24, the Prince de Conde receives Louis XIV, his cousin,
at Chantilly, where the steward Vatel organizes a feast fit for the
Sun King. But a small detail gone awry begins to gnaw at Vatel:
because extra guests show up unexpectedly, two tables are left
without roast meat, plunging Vatel, who has not slept for 12 nights
running, into a deep depression. The following day, Vatel waits
expectantly for fish deliveries to arrive. When only one purveyor
shows up, he turns to his assistant and says: ``I shall not be able
to live down this disgrace. I shall lose my reputation and
self-respect.'' Vatel goes to his room, props his sword against the
door and falls on it, inflicting a mortal wound. The missing fish
arrive soon after.
</P>
<P>
   Antonin Careme, the great 19th-century chef, honors Vatel as one
of the profession's martyrs. In the popular imagination, he remains
the high-strung, perfectionist French chef par excellence, the kind
who virtually dares diners to send a dish back.
</P>
<P>
   1794: The French Take Boston
</P>
<P>
   Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, aristocrat and gourmet, speeds
northward from New York to Boston to try the menu at a new
restaurant, Julien, where the consomme achieves overnight fame and
earns its creator, formerly a chef to the archbishop of Bordeaux,
the title ``Prince of Soups.'' There is no velvet rope, and
supermodels lie far off in the future, but Julien is nonetheless
America's first hot restaurant, a gastronomic destination that
introduces Americans to such fare as fondue and Perigord truffles.
It spawns the thousand and one fancy French restaurants that will
epitomize stylish dining in the United States for the next two
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   1843: Curse of the Cratchits
</P>
<P>
   Dickens, the supreme poet of English food and drink, creates
Christmas dinner for the ages in ``A Christmas Carol.'' His
evocation of holiday meals past and present is so powerful that
most readers do not realize that several dinners are involved. The
most famous is Bob Cratchit's. On a clerk's salary, Scrooge's
oppressed employee manages to assemble a heartwarming meal of goose
stuffed with onion and sage, accompanied by applesauce and mashed
potatoes. Christmas pudding follows, along with roast chestnuts,
apples, oranges and a jug of punch. Families around the world will
experience high levels of stress and an undefined sense of failure
trying to recreate the warm Dickensian glow year after year at
Yuletide.
</P>
<P>
   1903: New York Haute, on Horseback
</P>
<P>
   On March 29, a select gathering of New York's rich and powerful
turn up at Sherry's restaurant on Fifth Avenue to help C.K.G.
Billings celebrate the completion of his new racing stables in
Washington Park. The guests sit on horseback, and against a canvas
backdrop depicting an English pastoral scene, they eat from trays
attached to their saddles and sip Champagne through straws from
bottles in their saddlebags. When it comes to excessive, swaggering
display, New York once again raises the bar. The city's dining
scene will continue to be defined by such power restaurants,
although lavish feasting will give way to conspicuous
nonconsumption, as the relationship between girth and social status
goes into reverse. Important restaurateurs will continue to play
the role of social gatekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   1913: Little Cookie, Big Book
</P>
<P>
   Proust's narrator, Marcel, recalls the moment when the crumbs of
a madeleine soaked in lime tea reveal to him the great artistic
project he must undertake. As the English food writer Jane Grigson
later points out, that madeleine is deceptive. As food, there is
nothing much to recommend it. It works its spell precisely because
Marcel has dropped the habit of eating one with tea. When his
mother offers him one unexpectedly, its taste unearths buried
memories of Combray, the country town where Marcel went to visit
his grandmother. The term ``comfort food'' does not yet exist, but
this is it _ food whose power to nourish and sustain, even to flood
the soul with joy, cannot be explained in terms of taste alone.
Amateur cooks trying to recapture the Proustian moment discover
that a madeleine is nothing more than a soft cookie.
</P>
<P>
   If a tiny madeleine can generate six fat volumes, A.J. Liebling
wonders, what would have resulted if the narrator had polished off
a normal meal, say ``a dozen Gardiners Island oysters, a bowl of
clam chowder, a peck of steamers, some bay scallops, three sauteed
soft-shell crabs, a few ears of fresh-picked corn, a thin swordfish
steak of generous area, a pair of lobsters and a Long Island
duck''?
</P>
<P>
   1930: Hold the Linguine
</P>
<P>
   Filippo Marinetti issues ``The Manifesto of Futurist Cooking,''
calling for more chemicals, meat sculpture, the abolition of the
knife and fork and absolute originality in all forms of food. He
offers two recipes, Alaskan salmon in the rays of the sun with Mars
sauce, and woodcock with Venus sauce. Some of his ideas are
prescient. His proposal that diners be presented with an
ever-changing array of canapes with 10 or 20 flavors to be tasted
quickly anticipates the ambitious tasting menus of today's leading
restaurants. His call for abolishing traditional mixtures in favor
of experimentation with ``new, apparently absurd mixtures'' will be
realized in French nouvelle cuisine. His demand for an end to pasta
does not catch on, however.
</P>
<P>
   1955: Today Des Plaines, Tomorrow the World
</P>
<P>
   Ray Kroc opens his first McDonald's hamburger stand on April 15
in Des Plaines, Ill., after buying the rights to the McDonald's
name from the owners of a hamburger stand in San Bernardino, Calif.
The burgers are 15 cents. The fries are a dime. The rapid spread of
the golden arches across the the United States and later all over
the world will make burger-fries-Coke the most compelling food
combination since loaves and fishes, and a powerful symbol of
American commercial power. In 1999, Jose Bove, a French farmer,
becomes a national hero when he leads a fleet of tractors that tear
down part of the roof of a McDonald's under construction in Millau.
The French nation rallies around the sentiment that ``McDo'' is the
leading edge of American global domination and soulless Anglo-Saxon
free-market values. As it happens, French children, like Japanese
and Russian and Chinese children, love McDonald's and continue to
eat at them. The company, which has restaurants in 115 countries on
six continents, opens its 25,000th franchise in May 1999. The new
millennium has Big Mac written all over it.

SWEET, SWEETER, SWEETEST  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC ASIMOV   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just as dessert puts a sweet exclamation to a meal, sweet wines
can add luscious layers to any celebration. Made in almost every
wine region and with almost any grape, they range from relatively
simple wines like muscats to some of the most complex and expensive
wines in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The methods for making these wines can be painstaking. Good
Sauternes are made from grapes infected with the botrytis mold,
which shrivels them and concentrates the sweetness.
</P>
<P>
   The best of these wines are made from handpicked grapes,
ensuring that each is at maximum ripeness.
</P>
<P>
   While many German sweet wines, like the luxurious
Mueller-Catoir, are also botrytized, the sweetest of all, Eiswein,
is made by another method. The grapes are allowed to freeze on the
vine, which separates water from the concentrated grape essence,
and are then pressed, resulting in a wine of great intensity. The
United States produces some of these wines, called ice wines, but
I've never found one that matched the German combination of
sweetness and acidity.
</P>
<P>
   Tokay, Hungarian sweet wines, are part of a centuries-old
tradition, made by combining a base wine with aszu, botrytized
grapes kneaded into a paste. The aszu is stored in a barrel called
a putton (the plural is puttonyos) and then added to the wine one
putton at a time.
</P>
<P>
   The finished product can range from three puttonyos to six,
getting sweeter with each addition. The five-putton wine from
Disznoko is intensely sweet, yet acidic enough to be refreshing.
</P>
<P>
   Many people serve sweet wines with dessert, but I like them
alone, or in the case of the Sauternes, with Roquefort. These six
bottles just hint at the vast range of sweet wines.

`BIRDMAN': UPHOLDING HONOR AMID PSYCHOTIC LUST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Japan, Britain, Vietnam)  (Eds: Publications notes appear at end of review._ (DW) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The dust jacket on ``Birdman,'' a first novel by Mo Hayder,
informs us that Ms. Hayder, who is English, left school at 15,
worked as a barmaid, a security guard, a filmmaker, a hostess in a
Tokyo bar and an English teacher in Vietnam. The suggestion is that
Ms. Hayder has experienced the real world, which has helped her
write a crime thriller with a worldly, been-around-the-block
sophistication. Ms. Hayder has talent, but there is a vague line in
crime thrillers between a graphic, suspense-building wickedness and
prurient sensationalism, and unfortunately she has crossed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Birdman'' is essentially about violence against women, a
timely topic but also a hallowed one in this genre: the maiden in
severe distress and the hero who wants to save her. The hero in
this instance is Detective Jack Caffery, a smart cop and a moral
man with a secret that haunts him. Caffery, who is new to the
London homicide squad, known as Area Major Investigation Pool,
becomes the lead investigator of a series of murders that become
known when the mutilated bodies of five prostitutes are discovered
buried in a riverside industrial yard.
</P>
<P>
   In the early going _ indeed, three-quarters of the way through
her book _ Ms. Hayder produces a tight yarn with well-researched
detail on post-mortems, crime-scene scrutiny, chemical and medical
analysis and police procedure. A subplot emerges involving a racist
cop named Diamond, who jumps to the conclusion that a local black
drug dealer has committed the grisly deed, thereby adding to the
pressure on Caffery to find the real perpetrator.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Caffery's home front is messy. His girlfriend,
Veronica, is neurotically needy. His weirdo neighbor, whom Caffery
believes long ago to have molested his older brother, taunts him
mercilessly. When Caffery, in the course of his investigation,
becomes interested in a bohemian painter named Rebecca, he manages
to tell her both too little and too much about himself, and drives
her away.
</P>
<P>
   Soon Ms. Hayder introduces us to the criminal, or at least the
person we have every reason to believe is the criminal, and here
she provides a believable psychological portrait of the sadistic
psychopath as lonely misfit. His name is Toby Harteveld. He is
rich, weak and not entirely devoid of a sense of good and evil. He
is reminiscent of the bad guy in Thomas Harris' ``Silence of the
Lambs'' (not Hannibal Lecter but the evildoer Lecter helps to
find). His modus operandi does not involve placing insects into the
mouths of his victims, but he does leave behind a macabre signature
indicating that Harris was not far from Ms. Hayder's mind.
</P>
<P>
   So far so good. Ms. Hayder's writing is crisp and tart, and she
captures the terse profanity of cops: Marilyn Kryotos, ``the
universal mother'' and officer who keeps her unit together,
``seemed to deal with a murder in the same resigned way she'd deal
with a dirty nappy _ as if it were a faintly unpleasant, but
correctable, fact of life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Birdman'' comes complete with the standard skilled, sardonic
coroner, one Krishnamurthi, who says things like: ``I think you'll
find your usual suspects _ Diptera and Calliphoridae, first or
second instar, on the mouth, the nose, the vagina; and then on the
wounds, flesh flies still larval.'' Ms. Hayder's plot has clues
scattered throughout it, though you're likely to notice some of
them only at the latter stages of Caffery's dogged struggle with a
series of crimes that seem to become more mysterious as the
investigation proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   Then Ms. Hayder seems to lose her sense of proportion. A
fascination with sexual mutilation invades the story like the man
who suddenly sits up in the back seat of an unsuspecting victim's
car. For the final 50 or so pages Ms. Hayder does quick narrative
cuts: Caffery and his colleagues puzzling out the clues, potential
victims unsuspectingly going about their business, a madman
criminal whose deeds seem unoriginal precisely because Ms. Hayder
tries so hard to make them lurid and inconceivable. In the end the
standard thriller device is employed: Will our hero arrive on the
scene in time to save the would-be victim he has come to know best?
</P>
<P>
   But in these final pages Ms. Hayder's straining for nonstop
scenes of psychotic lust panders to the commercialized fascination
with unhinged perversion. It belongs to the horror genre and is not
exciting. Certainly it is unleavened by any of the satirically
witty qualities that invest Hannibal Lecter's version of absolute
evil. By turning her book into a kind of sexual chain-saw massacre,
Ms. Hayder ruins what started out to be a good addition to the
crime-thriller corpus, one that gripped the mind even as it
quickened the pulse.

  Tama Starr is chief executive of Artkraft Strauss, the Manhattan
company known for its giant animated signs, or spectaculars, in
Times Square, and the New Year's Eve ball that it tended and
lowered for 88 years. Three generations of her family have now run
the company. By TAMA STARR with DEIDRE LEIPZIGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I never expected to run the company. My background is
in liberal arts. After a year of graduate study in comparative
religion, I moved to Maui, built my own house, had a
windmill-leasing operation, was a freelance writer and was in a
performing arts group.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, growing up, I was always here. On Saturdays, I would
operate the factory machines and the office machines _ got a big
kick out of that. I worked the switchboard when I was 15, 16, and
helped write advertising promotions. The whole time I was in
Hawaii, I'd come back once or twice a year and pitch in. But when
I'd finished college, in the 1960s, and my grandfather brought me
in for a formal interview to ask what my intentions were, I said,
``Can I come into the business, Grandpa?'' He said, ``Absolutely
not. It's no place for a lady.''
</P>
<P>
   Grandpa Jake died with his boots on in 1979. My dad, Mel, had
come into the business right after college, and he was the crown
prince for 40 years. After Grandpa died, Mel had about six months
to enjoy being king of the hill before he had a heart attack that
kind of grounded him.
</P>
<P>
   I realized then that the company would not run on autopilot and
that it was getting to be my turn to invest personally. After all,
the company sent me to school _ it did everything for me. It was
like a family member. So I joined Artkraft in 1982. In the years
since that interview with Grandpa, it became no longer ridiculous
for a woman to be chief.
</P>
<P>
   I had to fight my way in. My father said stuff like: ``Who needs
you? Don't talk to the customers. Who said you could order paper
clips?'' He was as tough and mean to me as he could be. I
appreciate that training now; you have to be able to hold steady in
the buffeting winds.
</P>
<P>
   A family business has all kinds of strengths, like loyalty and
trust. But it can have weaknesses, too, like supporting people who
don't carry their weight. By the same token, we've got the strength
of 102 years behind us, but that strength becomes a weakness if it
allows us to become sucked back into the past. You have to take
whatever assets history gives you into the future. You have to move
on.
</P>
<P>
   My grandfather built the first New Year's Eve ball in 1907. My
company lowered the ball for 88 years, in sleet and fog and
terrorist threats and every other thing you can imagine. I myself
did 18 New Year's Eves on top of that tower.
</P>
<P>
   It was insanely difficult and I loved it. It was like being on a
track with a freight train coming toward you at immense speed,
gobbling up everything in front of it, and at the very last instant
it turns out not to be a freight train at all but two motorcyclists
who go right around you.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, we were replaced by a machine. Now the ball is lowered
by a computer operated by the mayor.

   MAC-FLAW _ ATLANTA _ Someone may have the means to clog the
high-speed lines used by a select group of targets, using a flaw in
the latest Macintosh operating system, according to John Copeland,
a Georgia Tech professor. Copeland, director of a center that
studies high-speed data, says someone has been scanning computers
from afar via the Internet, apparently looking for Macs with the OS
9 system. The Mac flaw would permit a distant hacker to trigger a
flood of data to be released and sent to a designated target. If
enough computers were sending data _ about 40 _ they could flood
even a high-speed line and close down an organization's Internet
access. (Kanell, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 25.

</P>
<P>
   BBO-ROCKER-BISHER _ AJC columnist Furman Bisher says John
Rocker, the Braves reliver who made numerous racist comment in a
Sport Illustrated article, should stay a Brave and face the music,

</P>

</P>
<P>
   FBC-MISS-STATE _ ATLANTA _ Mississippi State was one of the
surprise teams in the nation this season, starting the year 8-0
before finishing with a 9-2 record. Most of the success can be
attributed to an aggressive defense which spent most of the season
ranked No. 1 in the nation. A look at Mississippi State's defense
through the eyes of coordinator Joe Lee Dunn and what it has to do
against Clemson in the Peach Bowl. (Carvell, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 16.
</P>
<P>
   FBC-UGA-SANKS _ TAMPA _ For Jasper Sanks, life has been
interesting since his controversial fumble in the Georgia-Georgia
Tech game. Fans on both sides talked about the play for weeks, but
the sophomore from Columbus put the play behind him almost
immediately after it happened. Sanks realizes that he will always
be remembered for the play, but he's now focusing on helping the
Bulldogs against Purdue in the Outback Bowl. (Towers, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 18.
</P>
<P>
   FBC-GATECH-FEATURE _ JACKSONVILLE _ The Gator Bowl will mark the
end of the collegiate career of Georgia Tech quarterback Joe
Hamilton. Throughout his career, Hamilton was constantly reminded
of his size (5-10), but he started for four years and finished the
regular season as the ACC's all-time total offense leader. While
there are questions as to whether Hamilton will move on to the NFL,
there's no question that he will be remembered as one of the best
players in Georgia Tech history. (Clemons, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 18.
</P>
<P>
   WOMEN IN SPORTS
</P>
<P>
   WOMENSPORTS _ AUSTIN, Texas _ The 20th Century is really the
first in which women seriously compete in athletics. As the century
begins the founder of the Olympics, Baron Pierre de Coubertin, is
adamantly opposed to their participation in his event. There are no
pro leagues, no college scholarships. We chronicle the women's
sports boom, the changing attitudes and lingering prejudices. We
recount some of Texan Babe Didrikson's trials and triumphs, and the
early Olympic days are retold by a pair of nonagenarians who dived
in the 1920 Olympics in Antwwerp, Aileen Soule and Alice Landon.
Texas' oldest Olympian, Dorothy Langkop of Dallas, also recalls
what it was like for women athletes in the early 1930s. Many of the
stars of the first women's professional sports Tour, the LPGA, were
pupils of Harvey Penick, including Betsy Rawls, who talks about the
early days of the tour. We go through Title IX and one of its
products, the U.S Women's World Cup win. (Maher, Austin
American-Statesman). 117. WITH PHOTO.

in Athens on Wednesday. (Parker, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 20.
</P>
<P>
   BKC-UGA-HARRICK _ ATHENS, Ga. _ Is Jim Harrick feeling at home
in Athens? Or will he never be happy anywhere but UCLA? Harrick won
a national title with the Bruins, but was fired after turning in a
false expense account and trying to cover it up. Then he took Rhode
Island to the NCAA tournament, quit to take the Georgia job,
reconsidered, and later decided to come after all. Harrick faces a
rebuilding job at Georgia, but is off to a surprisingly good start.
The Bulldogs play Arkansas-Little Rock on Tuesday in Athens.

 &HT;    Pour it in: Champagne adds bubbly touch to recipes
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Champagne can be as delicious on the plate as in the glass. If
you've decided you'd like to indulge in as much champagne as
possible New Year's Eve or if you have a bit left over on New
Year's Day, consider some of these recipes.
</P>
<P>
   DESSERT
</P>
<P>
   Grapefruit Sorbet
</P>
<P>
   Makes 1 generous quart, 8 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 5 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Freezing time: According to manufacturer's directions
</P>
<P>
   Maybe along with a leftover bottle of champagne, you still have
that gift box of grapefruit on hand. If so, here's the ideal use
for both ingredients. A refreshing finish to a winter meal.
</P>
<P>
   5 small or 4 large red grapefruit, preferably Indian River or
Marsh Ruby
</P>
<P>
   1 cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup champagne, flat or bubbly
</P>
<P>
   Finely grate the zest of 1 grapefruit into a medium bowl and set
aside. Juice the grapefruit (you should have 4 cups juice). Strain
the juice into the bowl along with the grated zest. (Use a wooden
spoon to push as much juice and pulp through the sieve as
possible.)
</P>
<P>
   Put the sugar in a nonreactive saucepan and stir in 1 cup of the
strained juice. Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring
constantly, until the sugar dissolves. Do not let the mixture boil.
</P>
<P>
   Blend sugar mixture into remaining juice, add champagne, and
chill well. Freeze the mixture in an ice cream maker according to
manufacturer's directions.
</P>
<P>
   Serve the sorbet with additional sections of fresh grapefruit. A
little bubbly champagne can also be poured over the sorbet if
desired. _ From ``The Martha Stewart Cookbook'' (Clarkson Potter,
$27.50)

   New York Times food writer Molly O'Neill included this recipe in
her ``New York Cookbook'' (Workman Publishing, $17.95). She got it
from Michael Esposito, a butcher in Manhattan's Hell's Kitchen, who
advises: ``Never use any wine for cooking that you would not drink
on its own.'' He recommends serving this chicken with rice or
couscous.
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 whole boneless chicken breasts, well-rinsed, patted dry,
halved and trimmed
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons unsalted butter, margarine or light oil
</P>
<P>
   Juice of 1 lime
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup champagne
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound mushrooms, sliced
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   In a shallow bowl, combine the flour, salt and pepper. Dredge
the chicken in the mixture; set the breasts aside on a clean plate.
</P>
<P>
   Warm a nonreactive 10-inch skillet over medium heat. Add the
butter and when hot, saute the chicken until lightly browned on all
sides, 3 minutes per side. Remove the chicken to a plate.
</P>
<P>
   Add the lime juice and champagne to the skillet and stir to
scrape up the bits from the bottom of the pan. Let the sauce simmer
over medium-low heat until the alcohol burns off. Add the mushrooms
and nutmeg and cook until the mushrooms soften and the sauce
reduces by a quarter to a third, about 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Return the chicken to the skillet and cook over medium heat
until the chicken is cooked through, 5 to 8 minutes more. Correct
the seasonings with more salt and pepper, then serve.

   When we started searching for recipes using champagne, time and
time again champagne risotto recipes popped up. This is a good one
that includes scallops, but you may want to try substituting
champagne for wine in some of your favorite risotto recipes. This
can also be a side dish.
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons ( 1/4 stick) butter
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup chopped green onions
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup arborio rice or medium-grain white rice
</P>
<P>
   1 cup dry champagne
</P>
<P>
   1 14 1/2-ounce can (or more) low-salt chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound bay scallops
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   Melt butter in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat. Add
onions; saute 1 minute. Add rice; saute 2 minutes. Add champagne;
simmer until almost all liquid evaporates, stirring often, about 2
minutes. Add 1 can broth; simmer until rice is almost tender,
stirring often, about 15 minutes. Add scallops; simmer until
scallops are cooked through and rice is tender but still firm to
bite and mixture is creamy, adding more broth if too thick and
stirring often, about 5 minutes. Stir in Parmesan. Season with salt
and pepper. _ From: Bon Appetit, January 1998.

   Jared Brown and his wife, Anistatia Miller, came up with this
recipe while they were working on their book ``Champagne
Cocktails'' (ReganBooks, $12). Brown said now it's one of their
favorites. They sometimes substitute with oyster mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
   2 (8-ounces each) New York strip steaks
</P>
<P>
   2 to 4 tablespoons green peppercorns, cracked
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons butter, divided
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   1 minced shallot
</P>
<P>
   1 pinch ground ginger
</P>
<P>
   8 cremini mushrooms, sliced
</P>
<P>
   5 ounces champagne
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkle steaks with peppercorns. Use the side of a chef's knife
or the bottom of a plate to lightly embed the peppercorns into the
meat. Flip the steaks and do the same to the other side, then dust
both sides lightly with flour.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Melt 1
tablespoon butter in the oil and then add the steaks. Saute for 3
to 5 minutes. Then turn and saute for an additional 2 to 4 minutes.
Remove steaks from pan and set aside. Add the minced garlic and
shallot to the pan and stir constantly until the garlic begins to
turn golden.
</P>
<P>
   Add 2 tablespoons butter, the ginger, mushrooms and champagne.
Continue stirring and reduce heat to low. Simmer for 4 to 5 minutes
or until the sauce is reduced by about half. Sauce should still be
thin when ready. Spoon sauce over each steak and serve immediately.

 &HT;    Cooking with champagne puts sparkle in celebration
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Upon tasting champagne for the first time, Dom Perignon
reportedly called out to his fellow monks, ``Come quickly, I'm
drinking stars!''
</P>
<P>
   For lovers of fine food and drink, Perignon, who perfected the
basics of champagne making, is no doubt one of the stars of the
passing millennium. And come midnight Friday, millions around the
world will lift flutes of bubbly ``stars'' to welcome a new age.
</P>
<P>
   Far be it from us to suggest one not drink up every drop of the
sustenance of celebration. But should you awake on New Year's Day
to find a couple of overlooked bottles in the fridge _ and the idea
of another cocktail sends you spinning _ allow us to recommend you
eat the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cooking with champagne is a lot of fun,'' said Marissa Hardie,
an Atlanta food consultant. ``It adds a nice flavor. When the
alcohol cooks off, it isn't too flowery or too hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Chefs have long valued champagne in cooking for its acidity,
flavor and frothiness. Classics such as beurre blanc sauce and
sabayon rely on champagne.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy said home cooks can substitute champagne for wine in many
recipes. It's ideal in recipes that don't require cooking or where
wine is called for near the end of the cooking process. She doesn't
recommend substituting it in baking but rather going with recipes
designed for champagne.
</P>
<P>
   Jared Brown likes to use champagne in truffles or poured over
fruit. Brown co-authored ``Champagne Cocktails'' with his wife,
Anistatia Miller, and with Don Gatterdam (Regan Books, $12).
</P>
<P>
   Brown first got the idea of writing a book on champagne years
ago when he worked as a waiter at the famed Rainbow Room in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always knew if a party was coming in for business or for a
celebration,'' he said. ``If it was business, they would start with
martinis. If it was a celebration, champagne.''
</P>
<P>
   For eating, Brown recommends pouring champagne over fruit.
``It's really great over raspberries. Freeze them first, then thaw
and pour the champagne. The raspberries will just melt,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown also recommends pouring some in a fondue pot with cheese,
or using it with poultry. ``It seems to come through a little more
than wine,'' said Brown. ``Maybe it's just the imagination running
wild with the thought of pouring an expensive champagne over
chicken.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown says open bottles of champagne need to be used quickly.
They'll go flat within a day or so, especially if you don't use a
special champagne stopper. (You may want to pick one up when you
get the champagne.) Unopened champagne will keep, though if it's
been chilled, you'll probably want to go ahead and use it.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, we offer recipes for chicken, risotto and snapper, all
using champagne. And we give Brown's steak sauce made of champagne,
cremini or oyster mushrooms, garlic, shallots and ginger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just made it up when we found a half-empty bottle of
champagne sitting in the refrigerator,'' said Brown. ``Now it's a
favorite.''

 &HT;    A mouthwatering look at the history of civilization
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anniversaries, whether they be big or small, inevitably cause us
to look back at where we have been and where we are going. The
coming of the new millennium, which is at least symbolically a
profound turning point in time, has generated a proliferation of
programs and articles offering encyclopedic information about the
past 1,000 years of civilization, including wars, religion, social
changes, inventions, art, literature and more.
</P>
<P>
   One constant through all these changes is that human beings have
been trying to improve the quantity and quality of their food since
earliest times.
</P>
<P>
   An exploration of the food we eat, how we get it and how it is
prepared is a fascinating journey that touches on all aspects of
civilization. If you are interested in the history and development
of food over the course of human development, and assuming your
computer is up and running after Y2K, there are a number of
Internet sites that will keep you enthralled for hours.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Begin with the best. A Food Timeline at
www.gti.net/mocolib1/kid/food.html is nothing short of wondrous.
Information is presented in a time-line format, with exhaustive
links to hundreds of subjects, from the history of bread to space
food.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have the time to lose yourself in the Food
Timeline, a briefer version can be found at the History of Food
Development from Insight Magazine at
ificinfo.health.org/insight/foodhist.htm. It begins with the
creation of the hearth _ a major development for humankind because
it meant a permanent cooking place as opposed to roaming around and
gathering whatever could be found.
</P>
<P>
   Another good and humorously written time line from the Food
Chain is Food in the Eyes of History at
azstarnet.webpoint.com/food/ckhistry.htm.
</P>
<P>
   Recipes by Time Period at www.bahnhof.se
</P>
<P>
   /(tilde)chimbis/tocb/appendix/torchrono.html has loads of
authentic recipes from first-century Rome to medieval and
Renaissance periods up to the turn of the (last) century. If you
love reading recipes, you will find this site hard to turn away
from, beginning with Dulcia Domestica, a Roman mixture of dates,
nuts, wine and honey.
</P>
<P>
   If you are interested in herbs, treat yourself to Plants, Herbs
and Oils Throughout History at www.eliki
</P>
<P>
   .com/ancient/beliefs/herbs/. The site covers the myths, legends,
folklore and medicinal use of herbs, from the first known record of
curative plants from a Sumerian herbalist in 2200 B.C. up to modern
times.
</P>
<P>
   The Origins of Southern Food at www.uwf.edu
</P>
<P>
   /(tilde)tprewitt/sofood/past.htm is a scholarly look at how
Southern food evolved from many ethnic influences, including
English, Irish, African, French and Native American.
</P>
<P>
   You may care less about what people ate in centuries past, but a
look at a history of beer, barbecue and potato chips at
1800s.miningco.com/msubfood.htm may tweak your interest in food
history. Or how about the
</P>
<P>
   history of bagels and pizza at www.pastrywiz.com
</P>
<P>
   /letseat/.
</P>
<P>
   Pick a food, any food, from artichokes to zucchini, and find out
how it got here at the Food Encyclopedia at
www.sof.com/believeit/frame-encyclopedia.html.
</P>
<P>
   Most all the previously mentioned sites and many more are links
at A History of Fashion, Food and Fun at
members.aol.com/TchrfromOz/fashion.html.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, if you are still looking for more food for thought,
pay a visit to the Food Museum at www
</P>
<P>
   .foodmuseum.com/(tilde)hughes/, which does nothing less than
examine ``what in the world we eat and how we eat it, where it came
from, how it has evolved, what its impact is on culture, what its
future may be.''
</P>
<P>
   A mouthful, to say the least.

 &HT;    Michael Skube's 10 best beers in Atlanta
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This is beginning to look like a prize no one wants to
win.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, when the Journal-Constitution first saluted a
locally made beer as Best in Atlanta, the hands-down winner was a
maibock brewed by Glen Sprouse of Phoenix Brewing Co.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it was the pale ale brewed by Doug Nace of Percy's
Fish House.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Phoenix, crown jewel among the area's
brewpubs, closed. Last month, Percy's Fish House closed.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, don't look at us.
</P>
<P>
   Brewpubs, no matter how good the beer, are restaurants before
they are anything else. And restaurants, as anyone who's owned one
will attest, are a chancy business. Phoenix failed because it was
undercapitalized from the start, Percy's because it could never
establish an identity as a restaurant. No one questioned the
excellence of the beer at either place.
</P>
<P>
   Excellence remains the criterion _ excellence and a willingness
to innovate.
</P>
<P>
   By that standard, Dogwood Winter Ale beat out every worthy
contender for this year's Best in Atlanta award. A Belgian-style
ale that has the orange-gold hue of a ripe apricot, it was
conceived earlier this year when Dogwood founder Crawford Moran sat
down with his brewers, Matt Speece and Shane Duchock, to decide
what they wanted to do for a winter seasonal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is always our favorite R&AMP;D time of the year,'' Moran
says. ``We'd been wanting to do a Belgian ale anyway, and friends
were bringing us back bottles to try. So one night we sat down,
popped them open and critiqued them all.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the things they wanted to do _ evident in Dogwood Winter
Ale _ was to achieve the yeasty character of a Belgian ale but with
a more pronounced hop presence. Dry-hopped with Styrian Goldings,
Dogwood Winter Ale is more assertive than Belgians are accustomed
to, but there is no doubting its origins. The reason is the yeast,
the single-cell organism that is the least understood element in
brewing.
</P>
<P>
   Different strains of yeast yield different styles of beer, and
no strains are so individual as those in a Belgian ale.
</P>
<P>
   Dogwood borrowed the yeast for its Winter Ale from John Roberts,
head brewer at Max Lager's. ``Technically, it's a Trappist ale
yeast,'' Roberts says. ``But it's rumored to be the Chimay
strain.'' The ale has the spiciness of a Chimay, one of the few
Belgian ales still brewed by Trappist monks, and its body and
flavor profile are a winning blend of Old World tradition and
American innovation.
</P>
<P>
   Other Atlanta brewers have made Belgian-style dubbels, and very
good ones. But Dogwood Winter Ale stands out. This is a beer whose
distinctiveness is apparent from the moment you pour it into the
glass, catch a whiff of its nose and watch its rich, creamy crown
rise. In a word, a winner.
</P>
<P>
   This year as last, Atlanta brewers made close to 150 beers in
dozens of styles. In selecting the 10 best, six or seven were easy
picks. It was the next three or four that competed for a spot. For
each of those, there was another beer that came ever so close.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been more difficult if Phoenix and Percy's were
still around. Between them, they accounted for five of last year's
10 best, and they might well have accounted for that many this
year, too.
</P>
<P>
   In their absence, though, a number of outstanding beers were on
hand. In no order other than alphabetical, the remainder of the 10
best produced by Atlanta brewers in 1999 are:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Atlanta Brewing Co. Red Brick Summer Brew. Brewer: Griff
Braddock. Summer beers typically have a touch of citrus. Others are
like alcoholic Kool-Aid. Red Brick Summer Brew attempts no
gimmicks. It's a clean, crisp ale perfect for hot weather and
drinkable in other seasons as well. Part of the secret is the
almost pearlike character of the Ahtanum hops. It's also stone
brewed _ fire-hot stones are immersed in the brewing kettle,
slightly caramelizing the beer. A beer that's never gotten the
recognition it deserves.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Max Lager's. Pale Ale. Brewer: John Roberts. When Michael
Jackson, the British beer writer, visited Atlanta recently, this
was one of the beers that caught his attention. Well-hopped, clean
on the palate, Max Lager's pale ale uses domestic Goldings hops in
addition to Cascades, Centennials and Columbus hops. The result is
an assertive but unusually well-balanced pale ale in the Pacific
Northwest style. Roberts is content to call it a pale ale, but it
could just as well be called an India Pale Ale.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Max Lager's. Pilsner. Brewer: John Roberts. Most brewpubs make
ales better than they make lagers (Phoenix was the exception), and
few lagers demand the precision of a pilsner. The style should be
light- to medium-bodied, but never watery or fizzy. Americans are
often surprised to learn that a real pilsner is a fairly hoppy
beer, not the bland barley pop that mass-market brewers have
foisted on them. There are two slightly different interpretations _
the generally drier German pils and the more rounded (sometimes
``buttery,'' as with Pilsner Urquell) Czech variety. But they are
not mutually exclusive. Roberts' uses Czech Saaz and German
Tradition hops to achieve the best traits in both styles of this
noble beer.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Max Lager's. Brown Ale. Brewer: John Roberts. Traditionally,
brown ales are easy sipping beers, with almost no hop character.
When American craft brewers began experimenting with
long-established styles, they discovered what wonders could be
worked by the artful use of malt and hops. Max Lager's is an
example of an American brown ale, the malt character reminiscent of
its English ancestor but with real hop flavor and aroma (Cascades
and Saaz). There's many a hophead who'd frown at being offered a
brown ale _ until he had one like this.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Rock Bottom. Sweet Magnolia Brown Ale. Brewers: John
Glendenning and Brian Vandergrift. Winner of a gold medal at the
1998 Great American Beer Festival, this is a model of what a
traditional English brown ale can be _ malty with the subtlest
touch of sweetness, lightly hopped, medium-bodied and smooth as
velvet. Brown ale isn't a style I'm drawn toward, but there aren't
many brown ales as exquisite as this one. Americans often think
British imports such as Newcastle or Samuel Smith's when they think
of brown ale. None of them holds a candle to Sweet Magnolia.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Sweetwater. India Pale Ale. Brewers: Fredrick Bensch and Kevin
McNerney. When it was first brewed last spring, Sweetwater IPA was
fine on draft and a disappointment in bottles. It seemed thin and
wouldn't hold a head. Whatever the cause, it has been found and
thoroughly corrected. In its eye-catching yellow label, this beer
just gets better every month. Brewed with East Kent Goldings, it's
the hoppiest beer any of the city's microbreweries have attempted,
with a firm malt backbone and keg-fresh aroma.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Sweetwater. Festive Ale 1999. Brewers: Fredrick Bensch and
Kevin McNerney. Only 4,800 bottles of this rich, dark ale were
brewed, each numbered, each 750 milliliters in size. The spice is
subtle, and most people won't guess it. ``We put maybe a tablespoon
of mace to a kettle, not much more,'' says McNerney. ``We wanted
people to wonder what it was.'' They might not guess it, but
they'll know why a beer as complex and satisfying as this is sold
in numbered bottles. Sweetwater's three winter seasonals to date
have all been distinctive creations, none more so than this year's.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  U.S. Border Brewery &AMP; Cantina, Alpharetta. Milton County IPA.
Brewer: Chris Terenzi. Almost since it opened, U.S. Border has been
a haven for hopheads. The assertive IPAs are a specialty, and Chris
Terenzi is a brewer who's not afraid to experiment. One batch he'll
go with Cascade and Columbus hops, another with East Kent Goldings.
The choice makes for interesting differences. The IPA that Terenzi
made last spring with East Kent Goldings may have been the best
anyone in Atlanta made this year. Of all the area's brewpubs, U.S.
Border Brewery &AMP; Cantina is the one I find most congenial.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  U.S. Border Brewery &AMP; Cantina: Amber Ale. Brewer: Chris
Terenzi. An amber ale is one of the more familiar styles to come
out of the craft brewing movement. It's also one of the most
nondescript _ a safe, transitional style, with good malt flavor and
a restrained hop character that's not going to scare off the
uninitiated. Like Roberts, Terenzi likes to experiment, and this is
a style he has made far more interesting than it usually is. Not as
hoppy as his IPA, but a bold interpretation of what can be a dull
beer.

<P>
   FBC-MISS-STATE _ ATLANTA _ Mississippi State was one of the
surprise teams in the nation this season, starting the year 8-0
before finishing with a 9-2 record. Most of the success can be
attributed to an aggressive defense which spent most of the season
ranked No. 1 in the nation. A look at Mississippi State's defense
through the eyes of coordinator Joe Lee Dunn and what it has to do
against Clemson in the Peach Bowl. (Carvell, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 16.

<P>
   FBC-UGA-SANKS _ TAMPA _ For Jasper Sanks, life has been
interesting since his controversial fumble in the Georgia-Georgia
Tech game. Fans on both sides talked about the play for weeks, but
the sophomore from Columbus put the play behind him almost
immediately after it happened. Sanks realizes that he will always
be remembered for the play, but he's now focusing on helping the
Bulldogs against Purdue in the Outback Bowl. (Towers, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 18.

<P>
   FBC-GATECH-FEATURE _ JACKSONVILLE _ The Gator Bowl will mark the
end of the collegiate career of Georgia Tech quarterback Joe
Hamilton. Throughout his career, Hamilton was constantly reminded
of his size (5-10), but he started for four years and finished the
regular season as the ACC's all-time total offense leader. While
there are questions as to whether Hamilton will move on to the NFL,
there's no question that he will be remembered as one of the best
players in Georgia Tech history. (Clemons, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 18.

   WOMEN IN SPORTS
</P>
<P>
   WOMENSPORTS _ AUSTIN, Texas _ The 20th Century is really the
first in which women seriously compete in athletics. As the century
begins the founder of the Olympics, Baron Pierre de Coubertin, is
adamantly opposed to their participation in his event. There are no
pro leagues, no college scholarships. We chronicle the women's
sports boom, the changing attitudes and lingering prejudices. We
recount some of Texan Babe Didrikson's trials and triumphs, and the
early Olympic days are retold by a pair of nonagenarians who dived
in the 1920 Olympics in Antwwerp, Aileen Soule and Alice Landon.
Texas' oldest Olympian, Dorothy Langkop of Dallas, also recalls
what it was like for women athletes in the early 1930s. Many of the
stars of the first women's professional sports Tour, the LPGA, were
pupils of Harvey Penick, including Betsy Rawls, who talks about the
early days of the tour. We go through Title IX and one of its
products, the U.S Women's World Cup win. (Maher, Austin

   BKC-UGA-HARRICK _ ATHENS, Ga. _ Is Jim Harrick feeling at home
in Athens? Or will he never be happy anywhere but UCLA? Harrick won
a national title with the Bruins, but was fired after turning in a
false expense account and trying to cover it up. Then he took Rhode
Island to the NCAA tournament, quit to take the Georgia job,
reconsidered, and later decided to come after all. Harrick faces a
rebuilding job at Georgia, but is off to a surprisingly good start.

 &HT;    2000 What's in/what's out? Local, national experts give their
thumbs up, thumbs down
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, Dec. 30.
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ So you want to give your home a new look next year,
transform that barren back yard into a true garden.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe what's holding you back isn't the usual time and money but
fear of falling victim to trendy choices that will leave the place
looking dated in no time.
</P>
<P>
   To help avoid that problem, we saluted the next century by
asking 21 experts on homes and gardens _ big names in their fields
both nationally and in our own back yard _ to give thumbs up or
thumbs down to five things they foresee for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Their ``ins'' and ``outs'' ranged from materials (brushed metals
are hot; shiny polished ones are not) to rooms (offices and
functional spaces got the nod; formal living rooms and ``decorator
looks,'' the shaft) to design influences (Zen is in; feng shui's a
has-been).
</P>
<P>
   They gave a round of applause to hardy tropical plants,
old-fashioned hydrangeas and small, low-maintenance gardens. They
gave the ax to overused plants _ begonias planted en masse,
Bradford pears that fall apart just past their teens _ ear-piercing
leaf blowers and finicky, time-consuming lawns.
</P>
<P>
   A few chose to vent: ``Designers as dictators are in; designers
as slaves are out,'' said John Oetgen, an Atlanta (you guessed it)
interior designer.
</P>
<P>
   Others didn't hold back: ``Azaleas look like drag queens when
they are in bloom,'' said Atlanta garden designer David Bennett,
``and parked cars when they aren't.''
</P>
<P>
   And some got philosophical: ``Sharing and caring are in, greed
is out,'' said national decorating/entertaining diva B. Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Most had little trouble coming up with what's out (though we
were amazed that no one mentioned Debbie Decorators _ hobbyists who
brazenly hang out a shingle as ``designers'' _ and SUV grilles
adorned with Fraser fir wreaths and flat red plastic bows).
</P>
<P>
   The ``ins,'' however, left some dumbfounded. Perhaps it's
because they pay little heed to trends, realizing they can be as
fleeting as fame. Interior designer Bill Stewart opts for ``being
aware of design trends'' rather than ``obsessed'' with them.
</P>
<P>
   For Atlanta designer Monique Gibson, Elton John's favorite
decorator, what's in is ``a celebration of personality and
individualism'' in an age dominated by technology. ``Information is
so accessible and coming at such a rate that it's eliminating
trends,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   From that viewpoint, nothing's out when it comes to how we
decorate, how we live, how we garden. ``You find beauty in
anything,'' Gibson said. ``And if someone loves it, that's all
that's required in their home.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, with a new year, a new century and a new millennium
barreling our way, you can't help but wonder. . . . Notice we
didn't mention that trendiest of terms, ``Y2K.''
</P>
<P>
   Veranda magazine editor Lisa Newsom beat us to the punch:
``Anything with the word 2000'' is out.

 &HT;    Some gifts just can't be bought
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, Dec. 30.
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is the time of year when you count your blessings and _ if
you're greedy _ lament what you didn't receive for Christmas. Call
me greedy. I enjoyed much holiday magic, but my Christmas stocking
was missing a few choice items.
</P>
<P>
   It did not contain:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A furnace contraption that really does put enough moisture in
the air to satisfy the houseplants. Those portable machines that
you fill with water to get mist certainly don't do it.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Speaking of houseplants, I didn't get Jerusalem cherry or
China doll in a variety that's whitefly-proof. I've had to put
those plants in the ground, just to rid my home of these swarming
pests.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Chrysanthemums that grow tall, bloom full and don't fall over.
Ever. Even if I don't cut off unopened buds at regular intervals:
Memorial Day, Fourth of July and Labor Day. While such a gift would
enhance the considerable pleasure I already get from these flowers
(there's nothing like a splash of mums in a Halloween tableau), I
don't know if Lyn ever will appreciate this plant, no matter how
well it behaves.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A watering hose without tentacles that grab everything they
pass, including rocks, trees, shrubs, the edge of the house. Me. I
swear every hose I've ever owned has eyes. And a bad attitude.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A Southern magnolia that'll live easily north of the
Mason-Dixon Line. I've heard of a few of these grand trees
surviving in places like Michigan and Massachusetts, but they
normally like it better down home. If I had found a
guaranteed-to-grow-in-the-North magnolia under my Christmas tree, I
would in turn give it to some needy Northerner. With sweet, lemony
blossoms, lustrous leaves and stately form so evocative of the
South and so appealing to people throughout the nation, this tree
would make friends up North happier than Brer Rabbit when he
tricked Brer Fox into throwing him into the brier patch.
</P>
<P>
   Like all good things, however, my gift would come with a price;
the lucky magnolia recipient also would get a pot of northern-hardy
kudzu.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  While lamenting magic trees that I failed to get, did I
mention the northern-hardy live oak? Pity the poor Minnesotan who
never gets to the coastal South, missing the pleasure of seeing
this tree show off its curves, dripping Spanish moss, sensuously.
With a gift like that, I could be a hero in St. Paul.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A rainmaker.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Sensors that let me know several days in advance that visitors
will be dropping in _ so I can practice my lines, getting them just
right when I greet people: ``You should have seen the garden in
May.'' Or, ``You should have seen the garden two months ago.''
``You should see the garden in the spring.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Squirrel-proof tomatoes that produce fruit so offensive to the
bushy-tailed rats it sends them running and shrieking, before they
make even one of their many test bites into ripening 'maters.
(Actually, I'd like to get just about anything that's
squirrel-proof. Pansies, a bird feeder _ anything.)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  An electric gadget that mutes loud, gas-powered leaf blowers.
I could just push a button, and zap: I'd see (but mercifully not
hear) the blowing guy moving his cannon tube from side to side, his
ears covered with anti-noise earmuffs.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A snowmaker.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Roses that Japanese beetles hate (they breed thornless roses,
don't they?). The shiny little bug-monsters would swarm a plant,
and, like planes practicing touch-and-go landings, they'd
immediately take off again, making the most pathetic little
distress noises.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Another pick like my dear old pick that has hacked, pried and
dug its way through what must be several tons of Blue Ridge rock in
McCaysville _ and unearthed a forest of plants in many gardens and
woods. All without so much as a whimper. But everything breaks down
sooner or later.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Clay pots certainly do. And I didn't get any that withstand
Atlanta's ever-changing weather _ the alternating freezes and thaws
that lay waste to clay, cracking, popping and peeling pots galore.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Some mint that, instead of making me hungry with cute
fragrances like chocolate, orange and such, uncorks the
thirst-quenching fragrance of Jack Daniel's.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, well. Like so much that you don't get in life, my gifts that
weren't could amount to an opportunity: Anticipation is a wonderful
gift in itself. Here's to it. And to you.
</P>
<P>
   Cheers!

   WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
   CENSUS _ WASHINGTON _ The Census Bureau on Wednesday will
release new estimates showing sharp population increases in Texas
and Florida. The estimates, for the year ending July 1, show Texas
topping 20 million and Florida surpassing 15 million. It places
both of them among the fastest growing states in the country.
Georgia, with a 2 percent single year population increase, is
identified as the fastest-growing state in the South. (Dart, Cox
News Service). 20

<P>
   CENSUS-OHIO _ WASHINGTON _ Ohio's population grew a paltry .2
percent last year as 32,671 more people moved to other states than
moved in, the Census Bureau will report Wednesday. The growth was
due to births. (Dart, Cox News Service). 20.
</P>
<P>
   CENSUS-FLA29 _ WASHINGTON _ More people died in Florida last
year than in any other state except California, the Census Bureau
will report Wednesday. Despite these 159,752 obituaries, however,
Florida's population surged to over 15 million as new residents
poured in from other states and foreign countries and the state's
birth rate was even more robust than its death rate. The Census
Bureau report covers demographic changes from July 1, 1998 to July
1, 1999, and shows Florida ranking behind only California, Texas
and New York in population. (Dart, Cox News Service). 20.
</P>
<P>
   CENSUS-NC _ WASHINGTON _ With a surge of new residents from
other states, North Carolina was among the nation's fastest growing
states last year, the Census Bureau will report Wednesday. (Cox

<P>
   RENAISSANCE _ Even though the Clintons won't be there this year,
organizers of the annual Renaissance Weekend events in Hilton Head,
S.C., are expecting a record number of the nation's top thinkers.
But they say a handful have canceled because of a civil rights
group's boycott of South Carolina over the display of the
Confederate flag above the statehouse. (Manuel, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN-WEB _ In the first use of on-line ads by a presidential
candidate, John McCain used banner ads to help generate 10,000
signatures he needed to get on the Virginia ballot. And the McCain
campaign says it is hoping the Internet will help it make the most
of any bounce it would receive should it win the New Hampshire
primary. (Sherman, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 25.

   MAC-FLAW _Someone may have the means to clog the high-speed
lines used by a select group of targets, using a flaw in the latest
Macintosh operating system, according to John Copeland, a Georgia
Tech professor. Copeland, director of a center that studies
high-speed data, says someone has been scanning computers from afar
via the Internet, apparently looking for Macs with the OS 9 system.
The Mac flaw would permit a distant hacker to trigger a flood of
data to be released and sent to a designated target. If enough
computers were sending data _ about 40 _ they could flood even a
high-speed line and close down an organization's Internet access.

   CENSUS-GEORGIA _ ATLANTA _ Georgia led the South in population
growth in the last year and was fourth in the nation, according to
a Census Bureau report to be released Wednesday. Georgia's
population increased 2 percent to nearly 7.8 million for the year
ending July 1, 1999, and it was fourth in the nation in attracting
people from other states (a 1 percent growth rate). Generally, the
South ranked second to the West in growth. (Cook, Atlanta

viruses. We look at what they are, how they work and how to ward
them off. (Cocks, Austin American-Statesman).

 AT A GLANCE: The Gore Campaign  
(With GORE-CAMPAIGN) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEADQUARTERS Nashville
</P>
<P>
   STAFF SIZE 160 full-time paid workers.
</P>
<P>
   TOP CAMPAIGN STAFF Chairman is Tony Coelho, a former congressman
from California. Campaign manage is Donna Brazile, a veteran
political organizer. Top media strategists are Carter Eskew, Bob
Shrum and Tad Devine, longtime Democratic advisers.
</P>
<P>
   CASH ON HAND The campaign refuses to release an estimate, but at
the end of September, it had about $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   PROMINENT ADVISERS Chief domestic policy adviser is Elaine
Kamarck, formerly of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council,
now with the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard
University. Others who work closely with Gore are Karenna Gore
Schiff, his older daughter; Naomi Wolf, the feminist author, and
Andrew Cuomo, the housing secretary. He talks informally with
several other advisers, including Henry L. Gates, Harvard
professor, on racial issues; Robert F. Kennedy Jr., on the
environment; Gov. Gray Davis of California, on education; Senator
Tom Harkin of Iowa, on agriculture, and Representative Dick
Gephardt of Missouri and Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, on
general political matters. Among his closest associates are Tom
Downey, the former congressman from Long Island who is now a
Washington lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   BEST MOVES SO FAR Locking up the support of the Democratic
establishment early so that he staved off all but one challenger
for the nomination; amassing most of the superdelegates early;
revamping his campaign in September with a renewed sense of vigor;
winning the endorsement of the AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   WORST MOVES SO FAR He says his biggest mistake was exaggerating
his role in the creation of the Internet. More broadly, he
underestimated the Bradley challenge; he started his campaign on K
Street, Washington's corridor of power and influence, and coasted
for months with a bloated staff and a sense of entitlement to the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   CHALLENGES AHEAD Erasing doubts about his electability in the
fall; escaping his association with his impeached political
benefactor, Bill Clinton, but getting credit for the booming
economy; shedding the image of a career politician and appearing
less programmed.

 &HT;    A fight for respect in the 20th Century
 &HT;    (EDS: PHOTOS available.)
 &HT;    By John Maher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 20th century has been called the Sports Century, and women
closed it celebrating soccer in sold-out stadiums, slugging tennis
balls for hefty paychecks and hooping it up in a professional
basketball league televised in 125 countries. But the century
didn't start out with such promise. Not for women, anyway. They
were far more likely to be bundled up as spectators on the
sidelines than on the field competing.
</P>
<P>
   That mindset was reflected by the creator of the modern Olympic
Games, Baron Pierre de Coubertin. He initially intended his games,
first held in 1896, to be as the ancient ones were, for men only.
He wrote that their purpose was ``the solemn and periodic
exaltation of male athleticism, with internationalism as a base,
loyalty as a means, art for its setting and female applause as a
reward.''
</P>
<P>
   Women's professional golf pioneer Betsy Rawls said, ``I think
it's wonderful what women are doing now, but it didn't come easy.
Women had to fight and claw to get there. Just think back before
World War II. Talented women athletes had no chance to exhibit
their skills. They would have been ostracized. What a waste.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at Babe Didrikson. She was the greatest track and field
star. She played exhibitions in basketball and baseball, but she
couldn't make a living at it. She floundered around until she found
golf. Tennis and golf were the only acceptable games for women back
then. Had she been allowed, Babe could have done whatever she
wanted. She was that good. She could have been a billionaire if she
played in this day and time.''
</P>
<P>
   Things changed, and new opportunities arose, only because there
were champions in the truest sense of the word.
</P>
<P>
   Testing the waters
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be 80 years since I won,'' Olympian Aileen
Riggin-Soule recalled wistfully from her home in Honolulu. ``There
wasn't anything for girls back then. There were a few college
sports, but they didn't get any publicity. We never saw women
athletes. Women's track and field didn't come into the Olympics
until 1928.''
</P>
<P>
   The 93-year-old Riggin-Soule, a diving champion at the 1920
Antwerp Olympics, is now the U.S.'s oldest living gold medalist.
But she almost didn't survive to her teens. She was 12 when, in the
wake of the horrors of World War I, a scourge known as the Spanish
Influenza ravaged the globe. It claimed 10 million more lives than
the Great War, and Riggin-Soule's was almost one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I survived, but I didn't recover,'' Riggin-Soule said. ``My
doctor said I should take up swimming. That was unheard of. No one
swam then; everyone went bathing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the summer, shores were crowded with bathers of both sexes
who would wade into the surf, splash around some and wade back out.
Bathing was far more a social activity than an athletic one.
</P>
<P>
   Women bathers would have been hard-pressed to swim even if
they'd known how, anchored in the bulky and concealing costumes of
the day. Standards were so strict that in 1919, when Ethelda
Bleibtrey removed her stockings to go swimming at Manhattan Beach,
she was ticketed for ``nude bathing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the first in swimming suits,'' Riggin-Soule said. Like
Riggin-Soule, Bleibtrey had been told by a doctor that swimming
would be good for her health; she had suffered a bout of polio.
Both Bleibtrey and Riggin-Soule became members of the progressive
New York Women's Swimming Association, founded by business woman
Charlotte Epstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eppy was the brains behind it,'' Riggin-Soule said. ``She
arranged the trips and did the correspondence. We went by train and
bus. She arranged it so the least amount of money covered the most
territory.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We rented a pool on 59th, when we wouldn't use that, we'd use
the public pool at night,'' said Alice Lord Landon, now 97, who
also competed in the 1920 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   As divers, Lord Landon and Riggin-Soule had no coach. The pools
where they worked out were often six feet deep. They learned how to
snap forward quickly after entering the water and cup their arms to
protect their heads from hitting the pool bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was quite dangerous,'' Riggin-Soule said.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to swimming, however, the girls of the WSA did have
a coach who donated his time, Louis deBreda Handley, a big
proponent of a stroke he is often credited for inventing, the
American crawl.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with Handley's innovation and Epstein's organization and
persistence the WSA began dominating national competition.
</P>
<P>
   The young members of Epstein's club formed the core of the 1920
U.S. Olympic women's swim team, where they encountered more
opposition out of the water than they did in it.
</P>
<P>
   Riggin-Soule said, ``People wrote letters to the editor. Even
the officials weren't 100 percent behind us. There were a lot of
fairly important officials who thought we shouldn't be there
because we were so young.''
</P>
<P>
   Women began competing in the second Olympics, the 1900 Paris
Games, but those were more like a rambling, loosely organized
exhibition of sport than the Olympics we know today, and women were
restricted to such genteel activities as golf and tennis.
</P>
<P>
   For the 1912 Games in Stockholm, a 100-meter freestyle swimming
event, a relay and platform diving were added for women.
</P>
<P>
   A longer swim, 300 meters, and springboard diving were included
when the Games resumed in 1920. They were staged in Antwerp,
Belgium, an area that had been in the path of World War I.
</P>
<P>
   Riggin-Soule added, ``It was all very primitive. We didn't have
a pool in Antwerp. We had a canal. It was drab brown mud. I was
afraid. It was so dark. You couldn't see. I guided myself upward by
the gleam of the sunlight. On a rainy day, I was afraid I'd get
stuck and I wouldn't know which way was up. Some of the men were
pulled out with hypothermia. We were afraid we'd lose somebody
because you couldn't see if someone went under.''
</P>
<P>
   Riggin-Soule, then 14, took the gold in springboard diving.
Bleibtrey was the swimming star of the Games as the U.S. women
dominated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nobody close to her. Ethelda won three gold medals,
but she could have won 10,'' Riggin-Soule said. ``But there was
only the freestyle, the 300 _ officials thought 400 meters was too
much for women to swim _ and the relay.''
</P>
<P>
   Bleibtrey's three golds were all world's records, and her time
for the 300 meters shattered the world record by nine seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won the Olympics. Our little club,'' Riggin-Soule said.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't stop there.
</P>
<P>
   Although Riggin-Soule had to settle for a silver in diving in
1924, she also won a bronze in the backstroke. One of her younger
teammates there was Gertrude Ederle, the deaf daughter of a
butcher. Ederle had a disappointing Olympics, but that may have
served as her motivation for trying to become the first woman to
swim the English Channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had feet like paddles, like Johnny Weissmuller. She was so
powerful and strong, but she wasn't good at sprints,'' Riggin-Soule
said. Ederle failed in her first attempt to swim the channel, but
wasn't daunted and made another attempt a year later on Aug. 6,
1926.
</P>
<P>
   Unaware of her second attempt, the London Daily News,
editorializing about women athletes in general, observed, ``Even
the most uncompromising champion of the rights and capacities of
women must admit that in contests of physical skill, speed and
endurance they must remain forever the weaker sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Ederle not only succeeded in crossing the channel, she
negotiated the choppy waters more than two hours faster than any
male swimmer had done.
</P>
<P>
   Ederle returned to a welcome that foreshadowed the one Charles
Lindbergh would receive the next year for flying across the
Atlantic. Two million people cheered Ederle at a ticker-tape
parade.
</P>
<P>
   Getting untracked
</P>
<P>
   Things were not going as swimmingly for female athletes in other
fields. Upset that women had not been allowed to compete in more
sports in the 1920 Olympics, France's Alice Milliat founded the
Federation Sportive Feminine Internationale. A childless widow
whose athletic passion was rowing, the determined Milliat quickly
became a threat to the Olympic establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Her federation staged the Women's Olympic Games in Paris in
1922, with 65 women from five nations competing in 11 events and
setting 18 world records. Vexed by the growing interest of women in
sport and irked by use of the word Olympic, the IOC rebuked the
``abuse and excess'' of the feminists and decided that the
International Amateur Athletic Federation, track and field's ruling
body, should handle the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The IAAF voted in 1924 to admit women and govern their
activities. And then it decided that one place the women would not
compete was in the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   Milliat and other women were angered. Although they have now
been largely forgotten by U.S. historians, there were World Women's
Games in 1926, 1930 and 1934 in Europe. That presence and pressure
helped force the hand of Olympic officials.
</P>
<P>
   In 1928, five events in women's track and field were added on a
trial basis. The compromise was not enough to appease the British
women, the strongest team, who boycotted the Amsterdam Games. Some
wished The New York Times had done the same.
</P>
<P>
   In the 800 meters, the longest race for women in that Olympics,
the first six finishers all broke the existing world record. Yet,
The Times reported, ``The final of the women's 800-meter run, in
which Frau Lina Radke of Germany set a world's record, plainly
demonstrated that even this distance makes too great a call on
feminine strength. At the finish, six out of the nine runners were
completely exhausted and fell headlong on the ground. Several had
to be carried off the track.''
</P>
<P>
   Although this account has since been disputed, it did help
create a controversy about strenuous Olympic events for women. In
1929 the IOC's executive committee recommended dropping women's
track from the next games. But the U.S.'s Gustavus Kirby, a
powerful member of the IAAF, made it known that he just might pull
the American men's track team out of the Games, even though they
were scheduled for Los Angeles, if women weren't included.
</P>
<P>
   Kirby's power play worked, but the 800 meters was a casualty. It
would not be contested again in the Olympics until 1960. Other
distance events were slowly added after that. Enough women's events
were preserved for the 1932 Games, however, for America to find a
new heroine.
</P>
<P>
   What a Babe
</P>
<P>
   There's no real way to explain the athletic prowess of Mildred
``Babe'' Didrikson. Much like Jim Thorpe, a football and Olympic
star, Babe excelled at just about every sport she tried. She also
foreshadowed a boxer who would later redefine that sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was the most talented female athlete in American history
and she was the Muhammad Ali of her time, saying what she was going
to do,'' Olympic historian John Lucas once explained. ``Some
disliked her, but most said she was a refreshing voice of the new
woman.''
</P>
<P>
   That voice had a decided Texas twang. Didrikson, the daughter of
Norwegian immigrants, grew up in a family of seven children in
Beaumont, Texas, and played sports with her three older brothers.
Her prowess at slugging home runs on the sandlots earned her the
nickname ``Babe.'' Her first hurdle races were run over the hedges
of neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Her talent at basketball was spotted by Melvin J. McCombs, a
manager for the Employers Casualty Company of Dallas. The company
used women's athletic teams as a public relations tool. With
colleges de-emphasizing what few athletic programs they did have
for women, such clubs were the chief outlet for female athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Didrikson left high school and the next day she was pouring in
points for the Employers Casualty Golden Cyclones.
</P>
<P>
   After basketball season, Didrikson looked for another outlet for
her boundless energy. McCombs took her to a nearby college track
and began explaining some of the disciplines, from hurdling to the
javelin. She quickly demonstrated a knack for all.
</P>
<P>
   She once explained, ``Folks say that I go about winning these
athletic games because I have the cooperation thing that has to do
with eye, mind and muscle. That sure is a powerful lot of language
to use about a girl from Texas; maybe they are right about it. All
I know is that I can jump and I can toss things and when they fire
a gun or tell me to get busy I just say to myself, 'Well, kid,
here's where you've got to win another.' And I usually do.''
</P>
<P>
   In July 1932, at the AAU trials, Didrikson competed as a
one-woman track team for her company, entering eight events. In a
span of three hours, she won six gold medals and set four world
records.
</P>
<P>
   She left that meet bound for the Summer Olympics. In Los
Angeles, she won gold medals in the javelin and the hurdles and
also took a silver medal in the high jump. She returned home to a
ticker-tape parade and an uncertain future. She had unparalleled
athletic talent, but no way to make a living from it.
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, Didrikson's picture was used in an ad for the
1933 Dodge. The AAU responded by banning her for professionalism.
</P>
<P>
   AAU President Avery Brundage remarked, ``You know the ancient
Greeks kept women out of their athletic games. They wouldn't even
let them on the sidelines. I'm not so sure that they weren't
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Babe tried barnstorming with basketball and baseball teams. She
took a fling at tennis, where amateurs could receive
under-the-table payments from promoters, but found an injury
suffered throwing the javelin prevented her from serving hard.
Finally, she turned to golf, a game that almost always proves
vexing to even the greatest of athletes in other sports.
</P>
<P>
   She read the rules of the game 25 times. The woman who liked to
cultivate an image of being a natural practiced until her taped
hands bled.
</P>
<P>
   The United States Golf Association rewarded that effort by
kicking her out, deeming her a professional. Didrikson responded by
entering open events. Then, in 1948, she help found the Ladies
Professional Golf Association. The breakthrough organization is
still viable today, and Didrikson is one of the main reasons why.
</P>
<P>
   Rawls said, ``We weren't celebrities, except for Babe. She, more
than anything else, was responsible for us being able to survive.
She drew people to the tournament. She was the consummate
entertainer. If she was playing well, she kept everyone laughing
for 18 holes.''
</P>
<P>
   The early LPGA really was run by the players. ``We made every
rule and regulation ourselves,'' Rawls said. `` We kept statistics.
We wrote the checks. The players who should have voted for higher
first-prize money didn't vote for that. They knew that enough
players needed to make a living. Even Babe. She could be
overbearing and demanding, but not with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Babe won 31 tournaments in this country and her most stirring
win was the 1954 U.S. Open. Coming back from a major operation for
cancer, she destroyed the field by 12 strokes. It was her last
appearance at the Open. She died of cancer in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   Golfing historian Pete Alliss observed, ``Babe was a
revolutionary figure in women's golf for she had shown that a golf
ball could be hit by a woman rather than swept away with a long,
rather flat stroke. . . . Other women have followed who have
perhaps been longer _ a little _ off the tee, but she was the first
to show that a woman can hit a golf ball as far as all but the
longest hitters in the men's game.''
</P>
<P>
   Going to the hoop
</P>
<P>
   While the LPGA was the first viable women's professional sports
association, there were a few other paying endeavors for early
women athletes. One was the All-American Red Heads.
</P>
<P>
   The team began in 1935 as the Cassville (Mo.) Red Heads.
Promoter Ole Olson's wife owned a chain of beauty shops and
employees there formed a basketball team. Two were redheads and the
others, as something of a prank, dyed their hair red as well. They
later became the All-American Red Heads and picked up a number of
stars.
</P>
<P>
   Orwell Moore was coaching at a high school in Arkansas when the
Red Heads rolled into his town. He and his wife Lorene ``Butch''
Moore joined the team as coach and player in 1948, and in 1955, he
bought the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played men's teams. You would have had a hard time finding
a girls team to play this team,'' Moore said. ``We were the women's
basketball team of the 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore added, ``Gyms weren't as large then, but we have as many
attendance records as anyone in existence. . . . We couldn't just
play. We had to give something to the old boy who brought his wife
and five kids. It wasn't just a bunch of jokes, but if you were
going to stay on the road, you had to entertain. Nobody got up and
left in the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore said finding players wasn't that hard. ``Girls have always
wanted to play basketball,'' he said. ``There were a lot of players
in Arkansas, Mississippi, Georgia and Tennessee. We went to state
tournaments and found them. The main thing was that the heart was
in playing basketball, that the player loved basketball. We sold
basketball wherever we went. We told girls, get you a team. Go to
the gym. Hang in there. Some day this is going to change. And it
did change.''
</P>
<P>
   At many places that change was a long time coming. Although the
University of Texas has a reputation as being one of the pioneering
schools in women's basketball, players began the century here in
blouses and bloomers, with the gym off limits to male spectators.
</P>
<P>
   According to author and Texas basketball historian Richard
Pennington, intercollegiate basketball was actually squelched by
Anna Hiss, women's physical education director at Texas from
1921-57. Hiss was one of the feminists of that era who believed the
male model for sports was a poor one and that participation, rather
than excellence, should be the goal.
</P>
<P>
   She and others with the same mindset protested the participation
of women in the 1928, 1932 and 1936 Olympics and helped stymie the
growth of women's basketball at the high school level in this
state. A small college in West Texas, however, did not follow UT's
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Former Wayland Baptist Coach Harley Redin recalled, ``We started
a women's program in the 1940s. Our president, Dr. Bill Marshall,
wondered why women weren't getting an opportunity to play. There
were a lot of good high school players around. The small high
schools had women's basketball a long time ago. We had girls in
college who wanted to play.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while, Redin coached both the men's and women's teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was pretty hectic. I chose the women in part because they
were doing so well,'' he said. At one point Wayland won 131
straight games. The competition was mostly AAU teams and a few
small colleges such as the Nashville Business College and Iowa
Wesleyan. Wayland was known not only for its prowess, but its
method of transportation. A supporter of the team, Claude
Hutcherson, owned an air service and supplied the team with four
four-seater Beechcrafts. Redin, who flew bomber missions in World
War II, piloted one of the planes as the ``Flying Queens'' became
known throughout the sport. Redin was not only a respected coach,
he was also one of the pioneers who pushed for the restrictive
rules of women's basketball to become more like the men's.
</P>
<P>
   Net gains
</P>
<P>
   One sport where women did gain early acceptance was tennis, as
women competed for titles at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open even
before the turn of the century. But, even there, invisible barriers
remained in place until one bizarre night in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ellen Phillips, an author for the Olympic Century
project, ``Women's tennis was initially quite a different game from
the men's. Constricted by corsets, petticoats, stockings and long
white dresses, women played a slow, gentle game. They served
underhanded and competed with high lobs from the baseline. Skill
was defined by placement of the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   That changed in 1919, when Wimbledon resumed after World War I
and seven-time champion Dorothea Douglass Chambers, attired in just
such a fashion, encountered the future of women's tennis in the
final.
</P>
<P>
   Flamboyant Frenchwoman Suzanne Lenglen wore dresses cut just
above the calf, played with bare forearms and was fond of sipping
brandy in-between sets. She was a perfect sports heroine for the
Roaring '20s, and after she defeated Chambers in what remains one
of Wimbledon's most stirring matches, she became a true sports
star.
</P>
<P>
   According to Phillips, ``The U.S. men's champion, Bill Tilden,
thought she looked like a cross between a prima donna and a
streetwalker. He made it a point to tempt her into playing an
exhibition with him so that he could beat her simply to show that
the best women were no match for the best men _ a sign perhaps of
what a threat she seemed to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Lenglen, however, was able to draw fans while facing players of
the same sex. When she took on Helen Wills, ``The American Girl,''
in 1926 in Cannes, their one and only match created an
international sensation.
</P>
<P>
   Lenglen won and later turned professional, leaving it to Wills
to dominate the amateur ranks. Wills was followed by such stars as
Alice Marble, Maureen Connolly, Althea Gibson, Maria Bueno,
Margaret Smith Court and Billie Jean King.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the game remained in the shadow of the men's game. That
shadow darkened when Smith Court accepted the challenge of
55-year-old tennis hustler Bobby Riggs, who dinked and sliced her
to a 6-2, 6-1 loss in May 1973.
</P>
<P>
   King, who had ducked Riggs' challenges to that point, knew she
had to accept the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the start, I knew it was not just a tennis match,'' she
said. Her September contest against Riggs remains perhaps the
strangest setting ever for a tennis match. Although the promotion
was shameless and transparent, the match attracted 30,492 fans to
the Astrodome in Houston and it captured the imagination of the
American public like no Wimbledon or U.S. Open has ever done.
</P>
<P>
   When King won 6-4, 6-3, 6-3, it was not just a victory, but a
vindication.
</P>
<P>
   Epilogue
</P>
<P>
   By the time of King's triumph the groundwork for a revolution
was already in place. On June 23, 1972, President Nixon signed into
law the Education Amendments of 1972. That included a section,
Title IX, that mandated equal treatment for women in education
programs that received federal funds. As a result of judicial
interpretations the legislation came to set the standards in
women's athletics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, women's share of the total athletic budget was only one
percent. Soon, once-scarce college scholarships became plentiful.
It was the Title IX generation that provided women _ and American
sport _ with one of its most stirring triumphs this past year as
the U.S. women won soccer's World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the pioneers shared in the new triumphs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could no longer compete with the big schools,'' said Dean
Weese, who succeeded Redin as the women's basketball coach at
Wayland Baptist.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Heads, too, found the landscape changed. With women
playing basketball in high schools and colleges all over the
country, a team of women basketball players was no longer the
novelty it was back in 1936 when the Red Heads made the pages of
``Life Magazine'' while on a trip to New York. In 1986, after 50
years on the road, the Red Heads stopped touring.
</P>
<P>
   The Flying Queens and Red Heads, however, were back in style
when the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame opened this year in
Knoxville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Of the current athletic feats that women are performing
Riggin-Soule said, ``I'm amazed. I think it's wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   She's still pioneering. ``I've retained my crawl and backstroke.
I thought it wold be interesting to keep the old strokes, to let
people see them. I'm still competing.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed a swimming publication recently wrote that Riggin-Soule
was the only female age-group record-holder whose times were better
than that of the men's champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope to make it to 95 and set the records there,'' she said,
getting ready for the second century of women's sports.

&HT;     RIBS SPOIL GARNER'S QUEST TO BEAT REDSKINS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JEFFRI CHADIHA  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ The cameras portrayed an enigma standing
on the sideline, a parka pulled over his shoulder pads and
controversy about to rain down upon him.
</P>
<P>
   If Charlie Garner, the running back for the San Francisco 49ers,
could have heard the televised reports then, he would have shot
them down immediately. Instead, he spent Monday explaining why he
pulled himself out of the 49ers' 26-20 overtime loss to the
Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   Garner left in the third quarter and never returned. Though he
ran for 129 yards before his departure, he watched the remainder of
the contest while avoiding any medical treatment. On the telecast,
ESPN reported that Garner had injured his ribs but they couldn't
account for his not returning the game or his refusal to deal with
the 49ers trainers.
</P>
<P>
   When questioned Monday, Garner explained that he indeed had
aching ribs, that he had been playing with the condition most of
the last seven weeks, and as the Redskins game continued, he just
couldn't compete any longer with that pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time in the game, there was nothing that could have
been done,`` Garner said. ``There was no treatment they could have
given me in that situation to get me back out there.``
</P>
<P>
   Garner said the incident had been blown out of proportion. In
his eyes, there was no way he would have left that game, especially
not with the opponent being the Redskins and considering the kind
of night he was enjoying.
</P>
<P>
   Garner not only gained more than 100 yards on 16 carries
(including a 4-yard touchdown for the game's first score) but he
also caught three passes for another 39 yards. He was well on his
way to 200 yards in all-purpose running that could have helped the
49ers to an upset win. And there is no team Garner would have
relished beating more than the Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in Virginia and maintains an offseason home in the
area. He runs into quite a few Washington players there, and his
goal Sunday night was to spoil the Redskins' hopes of winning the
NFC East title. When the Redskins won, Garner said watching the
opponents' celebration was ``gut-wrenching.``
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to do well against them,`` said Garner, who has run
for a career-high 1,200 yards this season. ``It was really
frustrating. It would've been lovely.``
</P>
<P>
   Garner acknowledged he has been playing with sore ribs since
mid-October but the pain he experienced Sunday had not been that
bad since the 49ers lost to Minnesota on Oct. 24. In that contest,
Garner received a pain killer.
</P>
<P>
   Garner also admitted he has been wearing a protective jacket
throughout the season. He aggravated the injury early in Sunday's
game when a portion of the jacket raised up and a Redskins player
slammed into Garner's upper torso. He subsequently watched his
replacement, rookie Terry Jackson, lose a key fumble late in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlie simply took some big hits,`` 49ers coach Steve
Mariucci said. ``We asked him if he could go back in for some plays
when he was hurting in the first quarter and he did. But he took
another shot in the third quarter and he was in more pain. He was
frustrated and there was nothing anybody could do for him on the
sidelines. But don't question his toughness. That guy played longer
than most anybody else might have with that injury.``
</P>
<P>
   Garner is listed as questionable for Monday night's game at
Atlanta. Mariucci said Garner wants to play, but if he can't go,
Jackson will start in his place.
</P>
<P>
   Said Garner, ``I have to get some of the trauma out of my ribs,
but I'll be ready to go.``

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   The first indications of a change in the weather pattern that
has persisted across the nation for the past ten days will become
evident on Wednesday. One indicator will be a relaxation of the
cold weather across the upper Mississippi and Ohio Valleys. A
second sign of the change will be a weakening of the strong high
pressure system which has held steady over the interior Northwest.
However, it may take until early next week for a substantial
realignment of the upper air flow.
</P>
<P>
   Another cold, dry day is expected over much of the Northeast.
Sunshine will dominate near the coast, but clouds and leftover
flurries will be noted inland. A brisk breeze will add to the
chill. After a very chilly morning in the Middle Atlantic region,
lighter winds and ample sunshine will raise temperatures back
toward seasonal levels.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure stretching from the Carolinas to Arkansas will
control weather conditions in the South with plenty of sun along
with a slow warming trend. The clockwise circulation around this
fair weather system will direct warmer air from the Plains toward
the Middle West. A disturbance over northern Minnesota will sponsor
a little light snow in the northern Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Low clouds and freezing fog will persist in eastern Washington
and much of the Snake River Valley. A diminishing offshore flow
will permit low clouds to return to parts of the Northwest coast.
The Southwest will stay bright, but should be a bit cooler. High,
thin cirrus clouds are likely in New Mexico and west Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Storm Reverberations
</P>
<P>
   For the second time this month, northwestern Europe was battered
by a fierce storm. The latest blow came on Sunday when low pressure
as intense as a category four hurricane roared from the North Sea
into Denmark. Hurricane force winds were common from Britain into
the Baltic states and as far south as France. The storm that struck
on Dec. 2 resulted in serious floods along the Baltic coast of
Germany. These powerful cyclones can cause large shifts in the jet
stream around the entire hemisphere, with the first signs of a
change likely by the weekend in the United States.

<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ They don't jump out at you. Unless you know
right where to look, they can be hard to spot at all. But once you
find them, it's hard to take your eyes off of them.
</P>
<P>
   Monarch butterflies _ hundreds, sometimes thousands, of them _
make their winter home in three sunny, wind-protected spots around
Bodega Bay. The colonies, known as overwintering sites, are not
new. Monarchs have been migrating to the same groves of trees for
decades, maybe centuries.
</P>
<P>
   What is new is an organized bunch of human allies. The North Bay
Butterfly Chapter, fresh out of its own chrysalis, is spreading the
word about butterflies _ monarchs especially _ and advocating on
their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't seem like an important pursuit to some people,''
says Judy Crawford, president of the new group, ``but once you get
the bug, so to speak, you realize how important these creatures are
on a personal level and a scientific level.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching hundreds of monarch butterflies cling to each other on
a single branch of a tree is like looking through an orange, black
and green kaleidoscope ... without the kaleidoscope.
</P>
<P>
   It's a concentrated patch of simultaneous stillness and motion.
Closed, their wings look like soft brown undersides of new leaves
rustling in the wind. Even when there is no wind. Open, they look
like orange gemstones catching the sunlight. When the winter air
warms enough, they set out in search of nectar, making the hanging
colony come alive with fluttering bits of orange.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford and Julie West, secretary of the North Bay Butterfly
Chapter, led a troop of 27 amateur lepidopterists on an official
count last month for the North American Butterfly Association. They
estimated about 750 at the three sites, considerably lower than
recent years when estimates were in the thousands.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely fewer this year and nobody really knows
why,'' says West. ``That's one of the reasons it's important to
keep track from year to year. This could be just a normal cycle or
something could be wrong that's affecting their migration. If
that's the case, we want to know about it and try to fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   Butterflies are ectothermic, or coldblooded, so they gravitate
toward sunny, sheltered spots. The three Bodega Bay sites, near the
Bodega Bay Community Center, a stretch along Ranch Road and a
wooded hillside near Bodega Head, all offer microclimate conditions
among cypress, eucalyptus and pine, all favored by monarchs. Humans
are welcome at the two sites near Bodega Dunes Campground. The
third site near Bodega Head is on private property.
</P>
<P>
   North Coast colonies are not as thick with monarchs as some of
California's better known overwintering sites in Pacific Grove and
Santa Cruz, but local lepidopterists have a special affinity for
'flies in the 'hood.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't as many here, true,'' says Crawford, ``but you
don't have to drive forever to see them and it's sort of like
they're our butterflies.''
</P>
<P>
   Like wintering monarchs, the North Coast human butterfly
community hangs together. Several Madame Butterflies go along for
the monthly counts, including Louise Hallberg, maven of the
Hallberg Butterfly Gardens in Sebastopol, and Karen Tillinghast,
who oversees the butterfly garden at Sonoma State University.
</P>
<P>
   Local lepidopterists are well versed on all kinds of North Coast
butterflies _ where they live, what they eat, who eats them _ but
most butterfly experts have a special affection for the migrant
monarch.
</P>
<P>
   The monarch migration is unique in a couple of respects: It is
the only known insect migration in the world and it's believed to
be the only multigenerational migration of any beast, large, small,
winged or not.
</P>
<P>
   Butterflies hanging by the hundreds from Bodega Bay tree limbs
this winter will gradually warm up to a sustained sexual frenzy in
the spring. They'll mate themselves into exhaustion in a matter of
weeks, then set off on the first northward leg of their annual
journey. But they won't get far. Females, heavy with eggs, find
milkweed plants along the way, tuck their eggs under leaves and
die. Males, spent and flying swiftly into old age, also push north
but die well before they reach their destination.
</P>
<P>
   While the parents are dying up the road, they've left behind the
beginnings of one of the weirdest life cycles in nature, a process
every student studies at least once in science class: Eggs hatch a
caterpillar who eats the leaf it was born on, sheds its skin a
couple times and begins a metamorphosis unlike any other. The
caterpillar weaves a silken satchel around itself called a
chrysalis in which it transforms from a crawling creature to a
winged creature.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the monarchs, when the butterfly emerges and
dries its wings in the sun, it picks up the trail where its parents
left off. The life cycle repeats, sometimes several times, before
the destination is reached and migration begins again. Depending on
the length, flying conditions and food supply, monarch migrations
take three or four generations. Some longer. But the genetic
imprint that steers them appears to be consistent, scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the monarchs that return to Bodega Bay next fall
will for the most part be descendants _ probably great, great
grandchildren _ of the monarchs hanging there today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's miraculous enough that these fragile creatures make these
long, arduous trips in the first place,'' says Crawford. ``But when
you consider that it takes them generations to do it, it's even
more amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   One current theory is that monarchs follow magnetic fields and
they're born with genetic tuning forks in the key of the magnetic
attractions along their migration route.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scientists are doing projects to explore that theory,'' says
West. ``They put a bunch of butterflies in a closed room, move
magnets around and watch the butterflies get confused.''
</P>
<P>
   The effort to track and monitor monarch migrations is relatively
new. In Sonoma County, it officially started about 11 months ago
with the formation of the North Bay Butterfly Chapter, a local
branch (or wing?) of the North American Butterfly Association.
Unofficially, monarch colonies have been noted in the area since
early in the century.
</P>
<P>
   Although monarchs have been doing it for decades, probably
centuries, humans have begun to get the whole picture only in the
past two or three decades. People in Canada and northern United
States knew their orange butterflies disappeared in the fall and
then reappeared in the spring. People in southern climes had the
opposite experience.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until Jan. 2, 1975 _ a date held dear by
lepidopterists _ that serious study began on the migration of
monarchs. On that day, Kenneth and Catalina Brugger, amateur
naturalists from Texas, came upon a secluded sunny stretch of
conifers in the mountains 80 miles southwest of Mexico City. The
air was orange with flapping wings. Tree branches drooped from the
weight of butterfly clusters. Later estimates were as high as four
million monarchs per acre. Ironically, the full majesty of the
sight was lost on Ken Brugger, who was colorblind.
</P>
<P>
   The spot has since been determined as the overwintering site for
monarchs from the East Coast and Eastern Canada. The butterflies
and the tourism they generate have become a key part of the economy
for indigenous Purepecha tribes of central Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Bodega Bay's monarch clusters, which reached the 4,000 range a
couple years ago, won't become an integral part of the North Coast
economy, but local lepidopterists hope knowledge of the local
overwintering colonies will increase awareness and get people to
keep their eyes open.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are places we know about,'' says West, ``but that
doesn't mean they're the only places monarchs go around here. If
there are other places, we should make sure they're protected and
preserved.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows exactly where Bodega Bay monarchs make their
northern home. Maybe a local lepidopterist will follow them one
year.

   Monarchs, native to North America, are now widespread and
plentiful in many parts of the world. They are not in danger of
extinction. But new threats keep cropping up. A recent study by
Cornell University researchers showed monarch caterpillars exposed
to wind-borne pollen of genetically modified corn died or produced
smaller butterflies than nonexposed caterpillars.
</P>
<P>
   Releasing live butterflies at weddings, a popular and growing
trend, say concerned lepidopterists, threatens to disturb natural
life cycles, especially among migrating monarchs.
</P>
<P>
   Development pressures _ urban and agricultural _ threaten
several overwintering sites in California and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   One of the three known Bodega Bay sites _ a 3-1-2-acre stretch
of cypress and eucalyptus along Ranch Road _ was scheduled to be
subdivided and cleared four years ago. Neighbors and amateur
naturalists campaigned to save the butterfly colonies and won. The
California Wildlife and Conservation Board, using $225,000 from a
tax measure to protect and acquire coastal and park property,
preserved the monarchs' winter home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely consider that a victory,'' Crawford says. ``But
there are probably other places just like it that none of us know
about. If we know about them, we can work to protect them, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Bodega Bay is at the northern end of a trail of monarch
overwintering sites that extends south through California and
Mexico. North Bay Butterfly Chapter members have maps and
directions to 25 publicly accessible overwintering sites along
California's coastline.

`KENNEDY CENTER': LIVES BOILED DOWN TO A QUICK SONG AND DANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes appear at end of review.) (DW) 
 By RON WERTHEIMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   That's some funny job all those presidential candidates are
scampering after. The ultimate winner will get to face down world
leaders and recalcitrant congressmen and to pose every November
with a large turkey (the gobble-gobble kind). Once a year the
president will strap on his cummerbund and sit in the first balcony
in a Washington concert hall along with some movie stars, musicians
and other top performers whose lifetime achievement is being
celebrated. He can expect to see a pretty lively show.
</P>
<P>
   You can see it, too. Wednesday night CBS is broadcasting its
crisply edited account of the 22nd annual Kennedy Center Honors.
The event took place on Dec. 5, but all that crisp editing takes a
few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the subjects for glib adulation cover a moderately
wide spectrum of mainstream popular culture: Judith Jamison, Jason
Robards, Sean Connery, Victor Borge and Stevie Wonder. As usual,
each of them is treated to a short film biography and some onstage
tributes, which range from electric to puzzling. As usual, the show
includes plenty of standing ovations, plenty of emotional displays
and plenty of close-ups of a gleeful President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Each honoree has a chief honorer. For Ms. Jamison that role
falls to Morgan Freeman, who intones, ``Tall enough to touch the
sky and bold enough to try, Judy was a new kind of American
dancer.'' In a fitting tribute, members of the Alvin Ailey troupe,
which Ms. Jamison directs, perform a snippet of her signature
dance, ``Cry,'' with Dwana Adiaha Smallwood in a solo that was Ms.
Jamison's triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Describing Robards' acting, Kevin Spacey says, ``A lifetime of
craft goes into that single look.'' Then Robards, who is not
closely associated with the musical theater, is serenaded by
members of the current Broadway cast of ``Kiss Me, Kate,'' who sing
``Another Op'nin', Another Show.'' (Well, he has had quite a few
op'nin's.)
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Zeta-Jones, who actually appeared with Connery in the
recent film ``Entrapment,'' talks of how he embodies ``the assured
grace of true style.'' Yes, the film clip includes a scene in which
Connery says: ``Bond. James Bond.'' The Scottish-born Connery is
treated to several kinds of Scottish music.
</P>
<P>
   Borge, the one-of-a-kind musical comedian, who turns 91 on
Monday, is described by Christopher Plummer as ``a consummate
classicist touched by an impish magic.'' With a connection to Borge
that seems tangential at best, dozens of violin-playing children
offer him a rendition of ``We Shall Overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   In her tribute to Wonder, Halle Berry repeatedly notes that he
is blind, saying, ``Stevie sees with his heart.'' Toting up the
lifetime achievement of an artist who is 49 may seem premature, but
it provides an excuse for an entertaining medley of Wonder songs
performed by Herbie Hancock and his band along with the Motown
legend Smokey Robinson and the jazz singer Diane Schuur. This is
followed, for some reason, by a sing-along of ``We Are the World,''
which Wonder didn't write and surely didn't need to hear again.
</P>
<P>
   You may not love all this quite as much as the president does.
Maybe he's remembering that he still gets one more chance to sit in
the catbird seat with other celebrities. Or maybe he's thinking
that his successor may have the chance to beam down upon a tribute
to the artistry of, say, Jim Carrey, Shania Twain or maybe the
Backstreet Boys. If that's not worth slogging through all those
debates and primaries, what is?

PUNCHING UP THE FLAVOR OF FILET MIGNON

   Like a classic string of pearls, filet mignon is always
appropriate for a special occasion. And when it is accessorized
with an intensely flavored red wine reduction, rings of charred
onions and colorful pendants of crisp zucchini, this seductive dish
can go anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   This intense sauce, made with balsamic vinegar, red wine and
butter, is one of my favorite tastes. It combines beautifully with
the sweetness of the charred onions and really punches up the
flavor of an otherwise bland cut of beef. The sauce is a deep
aubergine color with a satin texture and a high-gloss sheen. And
since it is so vibrantly flavored and wonderfully concentrated, a
little goes a long way.
</P>
<P>
   The charred onions help balance the acidity of the sauce. The
slices of zucchini provide another textural component. Searing them
helps prevent the usual mushy texture and watery taste commonly
associated with steamed or boiled zucchini.
</P>
<P>
   For a casual meal, the charred onions would be delicious on a
burger. Instead of using a fillet of beef, a thick tuna steak can
be substituted and presented the same way. At the Inn at Little
Washington we serve a slab of seared duck foie gras on top of the
tuna.
</P>
<P>
   Most components in this dish lend themselves to advance
preparation, including the butter sauce. A trick for holding a
butter sauce up to several hours is to keep it in a thermos. The
onions and zucchini can be cooked ahead and arranged on plates to
be reheated in the oven just before serving.
</P>
<P>
   The filets mignons can be grilled and placed on top at the last
minute, giving you plenty of time to savor the last minutes of
1999, should you happen to be serving this updated classic at home
this New Year's Eve. And it would also make a fabulous last supper.
</P>
<P>
   FILETS MIGNONS ON CHARRED ONIONS AND ZUCCHINI WITH BALSAMIC
VINEGAR SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   Time: 45 minutes
</P>
<P>
   For the sauce:
</P>
<P>
   1 1/8 cups cabernet or pinot noir
</P>
<P>
   1 cup balsamic vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 shallot, peeled and halved
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons salted butter, cut into 8 pieces
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   For the filets mignons and vegetables:
</P>
<P>
   Extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 large white onion, peeled and sliced 1/4-inch thick
</P>
<P>
   2 medium zucchini, trimmed and cut diagonally into
3/4-inch-thick slices
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   4 5-to-6-ounce trimmed filets mignons.
</P>
<P>
   1. To prepare the sauce: In a small heavy-bottomed saucepan,
combine wine, vinegar and shallot. Place over medium heat, bring to
a boil and reduce to a syrupy consistency, about 1/3 cup. Remove
from heat and discard shallot.
</P>
<P>
   2. While sauce is still hot, whisk in the unsalted and salted
butter, one piece at a time. If desired, add a drop or two of water
to thin sauce to taste. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Keep
warm until ready to serve.
</P>
<P>
   3. To prepare the filets mignons and vegetables: Place a heavy
cast-iron skillet over high heat until very hot. Add only enough
olive oil to leave a film; place onion slices in skillet in one
layer. Cook until lightly charred on bottom, but do not blacken.
Turn over with tongs or a spatula, and char on other side. Onions
should be soft. Transfer to paper towels.
</P>
<P>
   4. Season zucchini slices with salt and pepper. Return skillet
to high heat. When very hot, film with olive oil and place zucchini
in skillet in one layer. Sear for 2 to 3 minutes, until surfaces
against pan blister. Turn and cook for about 1 minute, until light
golden. Remove from heat and transfer to paper towels.
</P>
<P>
   5. Brush filets with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper
to taste. Return skillet to high heat. When skillet is very hot,
sear filets for 2 minutes on each side (for rare) or to taste.
</P>
<P>
   6. To serve, arrange three zucchini ovals on each of four warm
plates so ovals touch in center. Arrange three or four onion rings
over zucchini. Place a filet on top of onion. Spoon three small
pools of sauce on each plate. Top each filet with a few more onion
rings and serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

`THE HURRICANE': A BOXER FIGHTING   THE DEMONS   WITHIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: production notes appear at end of review.)  
(DW) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One way to look at ``The Hurricane,'' Norman Jewison's stirring
but schmaltzy film biography of Hurricane Carter, the New Jersey
boxer who spent nearly 20 years in prison for a triple murder he
didn't commit, is to see it as the cinematic equivalent of an
inspirational pop song. Proudly old-fashioned and unabashedly
sentimental, ``The Hurricane'' pulls out every stop to make our
eyes misty and bring us to our feet in a standing ovation as it
rises in a predictable courtroom crescendo.
</P>
<P>
   Conjuring that kind of response, of course, isn't easy to do in
music or in movies. As anyone who has ever had to sit through a
saccharine performance of ``Amazing Grace'' or ``Bridge Over
Troubled Water'' knows, soaring, big-boned ballads require
compelling voices for their messages not to land in a soggy pile of
creamed corn. Movie stars playing real-life heroes have to be more
than glorified Eagle Scouts to win our hearts. Before we can
identify with their triumphs, we must first feel their suffering.
</P>
<P>
   In telling the story of Carter's protracted and ultimately
successful fight for freedom and justice, ``The Hurricane'' rides
to glory on an astonishing performance by Denzel Washington. As the
star ``sings'' the life of his embattled character (who is now 62,
free, and living in Canada), it is impossible not to be moved by
the depth of a portrayal that suggests the cinematic answer to a
performance by Stevie Wonder, Paul Robeson and Bob Dylan (whose
protest anthem ``The Hurricane'' is heard in the movie) rolled into
one. That is to say, Washington leans into an otherwise schlocky
movie and slams it out of the ballpark. If his Hurricane is an
inspiring portrait of nobility, it is because the actor never
conceals the demons of fury and despair gnawing beneath his
character's forcefully articulate surface.
</P>
<P>
   In an early prison scene Carter, who has been thrown into
isolation for 90 days after refusing to wear a uniform, is
portrayed as two different personalities at war in the same body.
One is violent and self-destructive, the other, determined and
self-disciplined. The notion of the boxer's two selves slugging it
out in a private ring of the mind may be simplistic, but it gets at
a fundamental truth about all life being a struggle between
positive and negative impulses and the choices all of us make every
day of whether to pursue our loftiest goals or to give up.
</P>
<P>
   In another devastating prison scene in which Carter, whose first
name is Rubin, is visited by Lesra Martin (Vicellous Reon Shannon),
a teen-age admirer who becomes a surrogate son, Washington conveys
the barely choked-back rage and frustration of a man who has been
so profoundly disappointed that he is afraid to hope and unable to
receive love. But as powerful as it is, Washington's performance
only partly camouflages the glaring flaws of a movie that is as
blatantly manipulative as a pep rally.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the title character's internal battles, the world of
``The Hurricane'' is a place where there is little room for moral
ambiguity. Everyone is either an angel or a monster. The angels are
defined entirely by their love and support for Carter. The monsters
are his enemies in Paterson, N.J., his home city where he and John
Artis were said to have murdered three men. The worst of the
enemies is Della Pesca (Dan Hedaya), a corrupt, racist, Javert-like
policeman whose sole aim in life seems to be the persecution,
humiliation and destruction of a man he knows is innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hurricane'' was adapted (by the screenwriters Armyan
Bernstein and Dan Gordon) from two books: Carter's 1974 prison
autobiography, ``The 16th Round,'' and Sam Chaiton and Terry
Swinton's 1991 book, ``Lazarus and the Hurricane,'' which describes
the authors' relationship with Martin, who enlisted them in
Carter's cause after he read a copy of ``The 16th Round.''
</P>
<P>
   In the film Chaiton (Liev Schreiber), Swinton (John Hannah) and
their partner Lisa Peters (Deborah Kara Unger), who move to the
United States from Canada to devote themselves full time to
Carter's cause, don't really exist as characters. The three, who
lived communally in a relationship that is never explored, were
doing pollution research in Brooklyn when they met Martin at a
summer jobs program and persuaded his parents to let him accompany
them back to Toronto to get a better education. It was at a library
book sale, according to the film, that Martin picked up a 25-cent
copy of ``The 16th Round'' and became enthralled.
</P>
<P>
   These benign, personality-free angels of deliverance whose
diligent, risky sleuthing uncovers crucial new evidence are never
more than stick figures in the film. Perhaps because the movie was
largely adapted from their story, it scarcely acknowledges the
contributions of the lawyers who donated their services to Carter's
cause for years. Although the movie hints at an attraction between
Carter, who is black, and Ms. Peters, who is white and whom he
later married, it tiptoes around this interracial relationship so
gingerly that it's just a whisper in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   The only bond that really matters in the movie is the one
between Carter and Lesra, whose appearance in the prisoner's life
rekindles Hurricane's belief in a future. Renewed by Lesra's faith
in him, Hurricane becomes as heroic and caring a mentor as a young
man could hope to meet. What makes this relationship so much more
compelling than conventional movie hero worship is the degree to
which it works both ways.
</P>
<P>
   In telling Carter's life story and the events surrounding the
1966 murders for which he was framed, ``The Hurricane'' covers main
events of Carter's life in brisk, vivid vignettes. The scene that
establishes the embattled tone of the rest of the film portrays him
as a boy savagely resisting the sexual advances of a much older
white male predator who (of course) turns out to be ``a pillar of
the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Sent to a reform school, Hurricane eventually escapes and joins
the Army, learning self-discipline through boxing. The film is so
eager to stir us up that it thinks little of bending the facts for
dramatic effect. Among its most egregious distortions is its
depiction of Carter's 1964 middleweight title match with Joey
Giardello. The movie (which has fine, naturalistic boxing
sequences) inaccurately portrays the fight as lost by Carter solely
because of the judges' racism.
</P>
<P>
   The taking of such license, of course, adds an extra jolt of
drama. But when these and other distortions and exaggerations are
added up, it's worth wondering if that self-congratulatory glow the
movie leaves us with has been gotten far too easily and at what
cost.

   JERUSALEM _ Making another gesture to Hezbollah after the
renewal of Israeli-Syrian negotiations, Israel on Tuesday handed
over the bodies of two of the group's guerrillas killed this month
in fighting in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Red Cross representatives delivered the bodies of Musa Ahmed,
24, and Hasan Salameh, 23, to Hezbollah officials in the southern
Lebanese city of Tyre after they were returned by the Israeli army.
The guerrillas were killed in a clash on Dec. 9.
</P>
<P>
   The handover of the bodies was the latest of a series of
gestures by Israel toward Hezbollah, which is active in a swath of
southern Lebanon held by the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by Iran and operating under the influence of Syria, which
is the main power broker in Lebanon, Hezbollah is fighting to oust
Israeli forces from the 9-mile wide zone that Israel says it is
holding as a buffer against attacks across its northern border. The
military conflict continued after the return of the bodies, when
Israeli warplanes and guerrilla groups struck targets in the zone.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Israeli official said the return of the bodies was ``an
Israeli gesture before the talks'' with Syria that are scheduled to
resume on Jan. 3 in Shepherdstown, W.Va., to be followed by talks
with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   However, several Israeli analysts linked Tuesday's gesture to
efforts to obtain information about Ron Arad, an Israeli airman
missing and presumed captured after his plane crashed while on a
bombing mission over Lebanon in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether a deal connected to the airman is in the
works, the resumption of Israeli-Syrian talks in Washington on Dec.
15 appears to have had a restraining effect on both Israel and
Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 16, Hezbollah departed from previous practice and
refrained from firing rockets into Israel after 15 Lebanese
children were hurt when their school was shelled by the
Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia.
</P>
<P>
   For three days last week, Israel and Hezbollah observed a
cease-fire described as the quietest in more than two decades as
Red Cross workers retrieved the bodies of five Hezbollah guerrillas
killed in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Israel released four Hezbollah members and another
Lebanese man. They had been seized in Lebanon between 1986 and 1989
and were being held without trial.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 21 Hezbollah members and other Lebanese were seized
between 1986 and 1994 and jailed in Israel. The Israeli government
says they are being held as bargaining chips in return for the
missing airman or information on his fate.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli court ruling stating that the prisoners should be
released has been appealed to the Supreme Court by the government,
and a hearing is scheduled for next month.

<P>
   The New York Times' computer football ranking is based on an
analysis of each team's scores with emphasis on three factors: who
won, by what margin and against what quality of opposition. The
quality of an opponent is determined by examining its record
against other teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Times' computer model collapses runaway scores and takes
note of a home-field advantage. Recent games count more than
earlier games.
</P>
<P>
   The top team is assigned a rating of 1.000; the ratings of all
other teams are percentages reflecting their strength relative to
the top team. This week, for example, there is a somewhat large
difference between St. Louis (No. 1) and Indianapolis (2), but a
small difference between Baltimore (5) and Buffalo (6).

&HT;     FAREWELL, CARLESIMO 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By GWEN KNAPP  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ It was doomed from the start. The P.J.
Carlesimo administration never had a chance. It had a preposterous
beginning, and we're not talking about the Choking Incident Heard
'Round the World. The season was already 14 games old when that
happened.
</P>
<P>
   No, the first hint of disaster came with those silly billboards,
the ones saying ``No More Mr. Nice Guys`` and showing Carlesimo and
his assistants in dark shades. I remember seeing one of the ads go
by on the side of a bus and cringing. I hadn't felt that
embarrassed for someone since James Stockdale melted down in the
1992 vice presidential debate.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, even before the ad campaign, there was trouble. When
rumors surfaced that Carlesimo might get the head coaching job in
1997, Joe Smith did an ESPN interview and said that he was nervous
about playing for the man who had made so many of his colleagues in
Portland miserable.
</P>
<P>
   Carlesimo's epitaph will be as ludicrous as his introduction.
The last word on Carlesimo's reign over the Golden State Warriors
belongs to Donyell Marshall, who, when asked about the coach's
harping on him and teammate Adonal Foyle, recalled those first 14
days, the ones that sent Latrell Sprewell grasping for Carlesimo's
throat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Spree just beat us to the punch,`` Marshall said in
his usual laconic way. He looked about as likely to erupt as Al
Gore. He looked about as frightening as, well, Carlesimo in those
ads.
</P>
<P>
   The coach's stock in trade wasn't intimidation. It was
irritation. He gnawed at certain players, particularly Marshall and
Adonal Foyle, two of the Warriors' young big men. Is that why he
was fired on Monday?
</P>
<P>
   It was certainly part of it. Three years ago, the Trail Blazers
fired him for precisely that reason. They had a winning team when
they dumped him. The Warriors can't pin the firing on one factor.
The team has lost too much, endured too much.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall, venting before Monday's 105-83 loss against the San
Antonio Spurs, cataloged Carlesimo's flaws, his rigidity, his
refusal to let the offense flow. Marshall's face brightened when he
talked about how Garry St. Jean, the general manager turned head
coach, had promised to allow more free-lancing, intuitive
basketball in place of Carlesimo's painstakingly scripted
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're already getting two or three new plays in there that
everybody's thrilled about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Marshall exhaled happily over Carlesimo's departure,
it was impossible to forget how much he grew as a player under the
demanding coach. Under the looser administration of Rick Adelman,
Marshall foundered terribly.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, the entire Warriors team ran aground with
Carlesimo at the helm. Last year, in the abbreviated lockout
season, Golden State played some of the most inspired basketball in
the NBA, outperforming superior teams, outhustling almost everyone.
But it didn't last. And when Carlesimo was relieved of duty, most
of his players conceded that he couldn't push the necessary buttons
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somewhere along the line, we were losing the passion and we
weren't playing for (the) coach,`` said Terry Cummings, a beacon of
professionalism. He helped stabilize the Warriors last season,
leading the team, and by extension, Carlesimo, away from the
Sprewell fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, with injuries up and down the lineup, Carlesimo's
grace period expired. More and more, players became exasperated
with him, with the clamps he put on them. Antawn Jamison, the young
centerpiece of the franchise, apparently grew weary of the stifling
system. He wouldn't say as much on Monday, twisting and turning
around the issue. He alluded to his problems with Carlesimo in the
most tortured sentences, concluding with: ``It isn't all the
coach.``
</P>
<P>
   But when asked whether anyone seemed upset that Carlesimo was
gone, Jamison thought for several seconds, the silence interrupted
only by a chuckle from locker-room neighbor John Starks. ``No,``
Jamison said slowly, ``I don't think anyone was upset.``
</P>
<P>
   He went out of his way to say that he considered Carlesimo a
friend and a valued mentor. Perhaps he was just trying to behave
with class, choosing not to kick a downed man. Or maybe he didn't
want the stigma of being another young kid who engineered a
coaching coup. If so, he shouldn't have worried. The Sprewell
episode put Carlesimo on the spot. After that, the coach had to
prove that he could exercise authority. Jamison, who thrived at the
spit-and-polish University of North Carolina, didn't have to prove
that he respected authority.
</P>
<P>
   It was one thing that Carlesimo couldn't get along with Rod
Strickland or that he infuriated Latrell Sprewell. Neither of them
has the sunny disposition of Jamison. Where they came across as
surly, Jamison projected exuberance and optimism.
</P>
<P>
   Foyle, too, is as earnest as young athletes come. He doesn't
have Jamison's soaring talent or the attendant clout with the front
office. But Carlesimo didn't advance his own cause by turning Foyle
into one of his favorite targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he went after me and Adonal because he knew he could
get away with it,`` Marshall said. ``Sometimes, I would say things
back to him, but Adonal wasn't going to yell at him.``
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the Sprewell incident, Marshall stood up for
his coach, in a manner of speaking. He said that he had endured
Carlesimo's sharp tongue and that he expected that from coaches. On
Monday, he virtually retracted all of that. He complained about how
Carlesimo drained the fun out of the game for him and, at the same
time, took the mystery out of the Warriors' game plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never recognized mismatches,`` Marshall said, taking a
choice verbal shot before he went out and made only three of 12
field-goal attempts against the Spurs. ``We've got guards on Adonal
Foyle, and we don't go to him.``
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Marshall had to admit that he would never have
choked Carlesimo. He endured for 2 1/2 years, outlasting the coach
rather than assaulting him. Now, he's looking forward to enjoying
basketball again. But will he? Will St. Jean do what Carlesimo and
Adelman before him couldn't?
</P>
<P>
   At least one person in the Warriors' locker room seemed to
realize that firing Carlesimo was just another wild stab at
success. Jason Caffey was visibly agitated both before and after
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's touchy for me,`` he said. ``It's personal, so I'd rather
not talk about it.``
</P>
<P>
   Carlesimo's departure was only the latest white flag that the
Warriors have waved. Then again, it has been waving since he showed
up, a white flag attached to dark glasses. He has been replaced by
a players' coach, a Mr. Nice Guy. But please, don't put that on a
billboard.

&HT;     EDWARD KENNEDY EXAMINED 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS  
 &HT;     c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a new biography, New York Times Washington
correspondent Adam Clymer makes a good and rather startling case
that Sen. Edward M. Kennedy is one of the greatest senators of the
century.
</P>
<P>
   A role in history was thrust upon him because of his name, and
although the part has not turned out as he might have wished, as a
public servant on the whole he has not let his family, or his
country, down.
</P>
<P>
   This will come as a surprise to voters who think of President
John F. Kennedy's youngest brother only as a scandal-prone rogue
mostly famous professionally for leading controversial liberal
causes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Kennedy, now 67, came to the Senate in 1963. He ranks third
in seniority in an institution where longevity counts.
</P>
<P>
   And he has put his time there to good legislative use.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts, which reveres his family name, will undoubtedly
give him a seventh full term when he seeks re-election next year.
</P>
<P>
   The White House was not to be his. But building a reputation
instead among one's peers as a Senate colossus is no small deal.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the 1968 death of his other brother, Sen.
Robert Kennedy, Ted was regarded as prime presidential material. It
seemed inevitable that he would use the Senate as a springboard to
carry on where his brothers left off. But he blew it big time.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, he drove his car off a bridge on Chappaquiddick Island,
killing a woman passenger. He never fully explained what happened.
And beyond the borders of his home state, voters never forgave him
for his selfish, reckless behavior that night.
</P>
<P>
   After years of passing up his party's pleas to seek the White
House, Kennedy unwisely chose to run in the 1980 primaries against
a Democratic incumbent, President Jimmy Carter. Most Democrats were
not amused. Carter defeated him, and that was the end of Kennedy's
presidential fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   He settled down to make the most of the job he had. The White
House loss was the Senate's gain.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he has accumulated a formidable record of
legislative achievement. Laws that he pushed through Congress have
made life better for millions of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Yet his arrival in the Senate as an inexperienced novice only a
year above the constitutionally required age of 30 was not an
auspicious event.
</P>
<P>
   President Kennedy, Attorney General Robert Kennedy and key White
House advisers like Kenneth O'Donnell had opposed baby brother
Ted's desire for a powerful political title of his own. The
president himself told me he feared that three Kennedys in
Washington would be one too many and wear out the family welcome.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest Kennedy, however, displayed the perseverance and
patience that have marked his years in the Senate. He commissioned
a poll that showed he could win a statewide primary and confronted
the president with the announcement that he meant to run, with or
without White House help.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with that audacious ultimatum, the president had no choice
but to throw the family political organization into Ted's campaign.
It would reflect badly on the Kennedy mystique if his brother lost.
</P>
<P>
   Ted's rival, Massachusetts Attorney General Edward McCormack,
complained that Kennedy had never worked a day in his life and that
his candidacy would be a joke if his name were Edward Moore rather
than Edward Moore Kennedy. Local voters didn't care.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two decades, with the security of a safe seat and
freedom from the complications of presidential ambitions, Kennedy
has gradually mastered the fine art of congressional leadership.
Clymer, who has covered Congress for 36 years, lists an impressive
array of issues on which Kennedy has had an impact, including
health care, civil rights, disability rights, education, arms
control and election law reform.
</P>
<P>
   As a policymaker, he has been splendid. Although he's an
old-time liberal, he has fashioned compromises across party lines
with conservatives to move his goals ahead. He takes a crumb when
he can't get a whole loaf or even a slice.
</P>
<P>
   He keeps his eye on the legislative ball, returning time and
time again to nudge his causes along. For instance, he has been
negotiating for national health insurance for a quarter of a
century. It is still a priority, and despite frustrating setbacks
he isn't finished yet.
</P>
<P>
   It has been harder for him to influence national policy since
the Republicans seized control of the Senate, relegating the
Democrats to minority status. His visibility is somewhat less
without a chairmanship. But he has remained on the cutting edge of
the great national debate over the country's future. He has never
wavered in his conviction that public servants should serve the
public, not just the wealthy few or the special interests.
</P>
<P>
   Clymer writes, ``He deserves recognition not just as the leading
senator of his time, but as one of the greats in its history, wise
in the workings of this singular institution, especially its demand
to be more than partisan to accomplish much. A son of privilege, he
has always identified with the poor and the oppressed. He never
quits, but sails against the wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicely said, and from my own observations, accurate too.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ America's health-care system from drugs to Medicare
is ready for the Jan. 1 rollover to the new year, Health and Human
Services Secretary Donna Shalala said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary's upbeat report on health care was similar to the
confidence that U.S. officials are voicing about other major
sectors in the United States, including electric power,
transportation and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't expect to see any major national failures as a result
of the date change,'' said John Koskinen, the chief of the White
House Y2K center.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has spent more than $100 billion to fix
computers with date-dependent chips in them to correctly read the
digits ``00'' as 2000. If computers aren't fixed, they may read
``00'' as 1900, malfunction and potentially cause havoc in such
computer-dependent sectors as the air traffic control system and
electric power grid. The problem is referred to as the Y2K glitch.
</P>
<P>
   Shalala gave this up-beat assessment of the health-care front:
</P>
<P>
   _Medicare : The computers that run the nation's health insurance
program for the elderly have been fixed and should be able to
properly pay bills in 2000, although some small doctor's offices
have not updated their computers and may encounter problems
submitting those bills. Actual medical care for the 39 million
Medicare beneficiaries will not be affected by Y2K, Shalala said.
</P>
<P>
   _Medical devices: Devices implanted in people such as heart
pacemakers do not contain date-dependent computer chips and are not
at risk of stopping on Jan. 1. Other medical devices such as kidney
dialysis machines may have date-sensitive computer chips but those
chips are used for record-keeping purposes and don't affect the
functioning of the device.
</P>
<P>
   _ Prescription medicine: A 60- to 90-day supply of most medicine
is currently in the distribution system. Shalala said there is no
evidence that Americans have stockpiled medicine as some experts
once feared.
</P>
<P>
   In October, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration began tracking
whether Americans were buying more drugs because of concerns that
the rollover to 2000 would stall computers and cause shortages.
</P>
<P>
   In one FDA survey, doctors and pharmacists reported that fewer
than 3 percent of patients had inquired about having extra
prescription medicine to last into the New Year.
</P>
<P>
   Shalala said there are still some concerns about Medicaid, the
nation's health insurance for the poor, which is run by the states.
</P>
<P>
   A few states _ including Delaware, New Jersey, Vermont,
Oklahoma, Nevada and Washington, D.C. _ had not finished upgrading
their computers as of November but were expected to be fixed by the
end of this week, a Shalala aide said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As with Medicare, any computer problems in the Medicaid program
are expected to affect billing, not health-care delivery.
</P>
<P>
   All states have fixed their computer systems to make welfare
payments in 2000, Shalala said.

`MR. DEATH:' A SLY STUDY IN DELUSION AND THE MYTH OF OBJECTIVITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada)  (Eds: Production notes appear at end of review.) (DW) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There comes a point midway through Errol Morris' deeply
unsettling documentary ``Mr. Death: The Rise and Fall of Fred A.
Leuchter Jr.'' when many who are watching will have the urge to
grab its loquacious subject by the throat, shake him violently and
yell at him to stop being such a damn fool.
</P>
<P>
   Up until that point Leuchter, a mousy, mild-mannered builder of
execution devices who clearly loves the sound of his own
scientifically detached voice, makes for engaging if ghoulishly
creepy company. But by the end of the movie he has become a pariah,
a case study of how an ``expert's'' misplaced trust in his shallow
research, fed by an inflated ego, can become a monstrous,
self-destructive form of denial.
</P>
<P>
   From the movie's outset this Boston-born engineer, who suggests
a young Don Knotts with a strong New England accent, appears
self-deluded. Although a proponent of capital punishment, he sees
himself as a humanitarian whose new and improved electric chair
will kill people without torturing them.
</P>
<P>
   Leuchter tells hair-raising stories of executees, as he calls
them, who were turned into ``vegetables'' because an electric chair
malfunctioned, of eyeballs popping across a room, of a head that
caught fire, of human flesh peeled from the bone ``like meat off a
cooked chicken.'' He also frets about the fact that most executees
spontaneously evacuate on the chair and the surrounding floor,
putting the guards in danger of electrocution because they are
standing in pools of highly conductive liquid.
</P>
<P>
   It was Leuchter's reputation as the designer of a more efficient
electric chair that led to other offers for him to create a
lethal-injection machine, a better gallows and a safer, no-leak gas
chamber. In 1988 his expertise brought him to the attention of
Ernst Zuendel, a neo-Nazi and Holocaust denier on trial in Toronto
for violating a Canadian hate-crimes statute by publishing a false
history with intent to incite racial hatred.
</P>
<P>
   Zuendel and his advisers came up with a scheme to hire Leuchter
as a gas-chamber expert and defense witness and sent him, along
with a draftsman and video camera operator, to Auschwitz. Here
Leuchter surreptitiously and illegally chipped away samples from
the walls and floors of rooms once used as gas chambers and
smuggled them back to the United States to be tested for residues
of cyanide. When none were detected, Leuchter concluded that there
were no mass gas executions in Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   Although the trial's judge refused to allow Leuchter's findings
into evidence, they were published and widely circulated by
neo-Nazi organizations that have since used ``The Leuchter Report''
as a major document in their argument that no Jews were killed with
poison gas in the death camp. With hundreds of thousands of copies
of his report in print, Leuchter, savoring his dubious notoriety,
became a sought-after speaker on the neo-Nazi European lecture
circuit.
</P>
<P>
   But that notoriety also cost Leuchter his short-lived marriage
to a Dunkin' Donuts employee and eventually his livelihood when
members of outraged Holocaust-survivor organizations pressured
death-penalty states not to employ him. He complains that in
Massachusetts, his home state, he was prosecuted and threatened
with imprisonment for not having an engineer's license even though
only 10 percent of the state's engineers possess such licenses.
Leuchter earnestly insists he is not and never has been an
anti-Semite.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Mr. Death'' offers overwhelming counterarguments to
Leuchter's research, the movie finally is not about who is right or
wrong. Any sensible person (including the filmmaker) accepts the
reality of the Holocaust. The movie is really a study of hubris,
the myth of objectivity and the fatal attraction of needy people to
attention and flattery even if it comes from the wrong quarters.
</P>
<P>
   It also reminds us that denying the Holocaust is nothing new. As
one Holocaust expert points out while displaying documents in which
references to the gas chambers were couched in coded language, the
very same Nazis who were carrying out Hitler's final solution were
the original Holocaust deniers.
</P>
<P>
   Morris, instead of evoking the solemnity that surrounds most
films that touch on the Holocaust, has directed ``Mr. Death'' as
the blackest of comedies. The movie opens and closes with
electrical explosions and fireworks (accompanied by a grandiose
horror-film soundtrack) that suggest Frankenstein's laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   As we get to know Leuchter the music turns innocuously chirpy
and sitcomy. The stylish cinematography, which examines faces from
odd, sometimes sinister perspectives, accentuates the film's
fun-house atmosphere. In the scenes of Leuchter chattering
excitedly to the video camera as he meticulously chisels fragments
from the gas chamber walls, he comes across as a thoroughly nutty
Sherlock Holmes caricature.
</P>
<P>
   In making us like Leuchter (sort of) in the beginning before
showing his other face, the movie forces us to question the degree
to which we share his capacity for denial.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Mr. Death,'' instead of mounting a pulpit or striking a
psychotherapeutic pose, comes at us sideways, with a sly sense of
humor that reflects the twisted half-smiles its subject flashes
nervously at the camera. Think of ``Mr. Death'' as the best
comedy-horror documentary about the Holocaust ever made.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Death'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It
contains graphic descriptions of executions.
</P>

 TENDER IS THE YOLK: BAKING EGGS  (mk) 
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Baked eggs are not common these days, but they are both easy and
underrated, especially as a morning-after indulgence. I first
encountered them combined with slow-cooked onions, cheese and bread
crumbs, a recipe taught me by a college friend whose family had
been making them for years. The dish was originally called
``man-style eggs,'' presumably because of its heartiness. These
days, the family calls them ``eggs, person-style,'' but I prefer
the more generic name in the recipe below.
</P>
<P>
   Eggs can be baked on a bed of almost anything _ cooked spinach
and sliced tomatoes come to mind immediately _ but the trick in
every case is to avoid overcooking. The consistency of baked eggs
should be like that of fried eggs, with a barely cooked white and a
soft, runny yolk. When you cut into the yolk, it spills out over
bread crumbs, melted cheese and onions, moistening and enriching
the lot. But if the dish is left just a minute too long in the
oven, the yolk will become medium- or hard-cooked, and much of the
pleasure will be lost.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way to master the timing is to underbake the eggs
slightly and then to finish them under the broiler, keeping a
careful eye on them all the while. Even then, overcooking is a
danger, and it's better to remove the eggs prematurely and let the
heat of the pan finish the cooking than to allow the yolk to
harden.
</P>
<P>
   I've played with this recipe over the years, but the most
important changes I've made are in the bread crumbs and cheese. The
former were originally packaged and the latter was originally just
Cheddar from the supermarket. But now I make my own bread crumbs
and use a combination of Gruyere, Cantal or good Cheddar with
freshly grated Parmesan. The difference, not surprisingly, is
significant.
</P>
<P>
   To make fresh bread crumbs, dry out a couple of slices of good
bread in a low oven (or leave them on the counter for a day or so)
and then grind them in a food processor. Coarse crumbs are best, as
they become crunchy rather than sandy when baked.
</P>
<P>
   Baked Eggs with Onions and Cheese
</P>
<P>
   Total time: 30 minutes
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons butter or olive oil
</P>
<P>
   4 cups sliced onions
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups coarse bread crumbs
</P>
<P>
   1 cup grated cheese, like Gruyere or Emmenthal
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup grated Parmesan
</P>
<P>
   8 eggs
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Put the butter or oil in a
large, ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onions and
a liberal sprinkling of salt and pepper, cover the skillet, and
turn the heat to medium. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the
onions are very soft and tender but not browned, about 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   2. Combine the bread crumbs and cheeses and sprinkle half this
mixture over the onions. Use the back of a spoon to make 8 little
nests in the mixture and crack an egg into each. Top with some salt
and pepper and the remaining bread crumb and cheese mixture.
</P>
<P>
   3. Bake for 5 minutes, or until the eggs are barely set; turn on
the broiler and brown the top for a minute or so, but be careful
not to overcook the eggs. Serve hot or at room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 to 8 servings

 &HT;    McCain to share in the millennium spotlight
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The producers of a nationally televised millennium
celebration on New Year's Eve are giving five minutes of their
star-studded show to Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Along with performances by host Will Smith, country music singer
Trisha Yearwood, and opera stars Jessye Norman and Kathleen Battle,
McCain will deliver a tribute to the nation's military veterans on
the CBS special, his campaign announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a prisoner of war in Vietnam and former Navy pilot, will
speak at 11:25 p.m. and will be followed by Steven Spielberg's
documentary on the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   The program on the Mall is an extraordinary gift of free
publicity for any candidate, and more so for one whose party does
not control the White House.
</P>
<P>
   First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton has played a leading role in
Washington's weekend-long celebration, which includes the New
Year's Eve gala. Calls to the first lady's press office were not
returned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign spokeswoman Nancy Ives said the invitation came from
the show's producers, Quincy Jones and George Stevens Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The topic of McCain's remarks meshes with his frequent comments
about veterans and his campaign's relentless use of the story of
his five and a half years in captivity in North Vietnam. McCain
also has written a best-selling memoir of that time, ``Faith of My
Fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator from Arizona had originally planned to be at home
with his family.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, trailing McCain in polls in New
Hampshire, but far ahead in most other states, will be in Austin,
Texas, Friday, said campaign spokeswoman Mindy Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every candidate gets to choose how to spend New Year's Eve,''
Tucker said. ``The governor will be spending a quiet evening at
home with his family.''

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Seventeen years ago, when he was just out of
college, Sandy Grushow was hired as an intern by Tom Sherak, a top
executive at the 20th Century Fox film studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sandy carried ads from one office to another, and he ran
faster than any other messenger,'' Sherak, now chairman of the
company's Domestic Film Group, recalled. ``He was like a sponge. He
took everything in.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherak remembered calling another executive, Jack Brodsky, with
a request about the young Grushow. ``I want you to give him a job
because someday we'll all be working for him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And he wasn't far from wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Grushow, now 39, was appointed chairman of the Fox Television
Entertainment Group last month. He will also continue in the job he
has had for nearly three years as head of Fox's television
production arm, the most successful in the business with 20 series
featured on various broadcast networks.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of jobs puts Grushow in the highest tier of
television power, a tribute, supporters say, to his astute
marketing skills and trustworthiness in a watch-your-back industry.
Others attribute his success, at least in part, to steely ambition
and confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, he is in the middle of at least a couple of
story lines worthy of television miniseries. The first is the
pressure to revive a once high-flying network where former
executives, including Grushow at one point, have fallen more
quickly than Fox's recent ratings.
</P>
<P>
   The second is his ability to deal with what some talent agents
and producers view as an ominous trend in television. This is the
appointment of a single executive or executive team to two jobs
with a built-in potential for conflict of interest, the management
both of a network and of a studio that sells programming to its
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   While trying to find the best shows for the Fox network,
Grushow, in his role at the Fox studio, will be selling series to
competitors. Then he will be in the business of making programming
choices for his network to combat Fox studio shows broadcast
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   It is a situation that the two top executives at ABC Television
(owned by Walt Disney), who run the network as well as Disney
television operations, are also dealing with.
</P>
<P>
   But where the ABC team explicitly wants to turn out shows for
its own network first, Grushow says he can tend to Fox and make his
competitors happy as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job is to stay the No. 1 studio in terms of producing
successful and profitable prime-time hits for all six broadcast
networks,'' he said. ``If a writer we're involved with has an idea
for the Fox network, then it'll probably wind up at Fox. If it's
not for the Fox network, it won't.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to play it as cleanly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Seated in his office, dapper, compact and bespectacled, he
described his new challenge at the network bluntly: ``Our ratings
are down. A number of shows are aging. This has been a long time in
the making.''
</P>
<P>
   The network flourished in the early 1990s but has foundered in a
swirl of competition, executive turmoil and bad decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The network's struggle is to recapture the youthful, minority
and hip audiences that have, to some degree, abandoned Fox for
networks like the WB (mostly girls) and UPN (mostly boys) as well
as cable stations like Comedy Central, MTV, BET and E. Successful
and innovative Fox shows are aging, among them the animated shows
``The Simpsons'' and ``King of the Hill,'' reality-based series
like ``Cops,'' youth-oriented shows like ``Beverly Hills 90210''
and ``Party of Five,'' and the drama ``X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox has fallen behind NBC and ABC this year among 18- to
49-year-olds. Even CBS, which traditionally appeals to older
audiences, is crowding Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly there's been some backsliding,'' Grushow acknowledged.
`We've got to return to our roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal really is to get people's attention by doing shows
that are distinctive, that are inherently noisy, that are unique,
that speak with an alternative voice.''
</P>
<P>
   The revolving executive door at the network, which is owned by
Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., seems almost dizzying. Grushow himself
was ousted as Fox's top television programmer in 1994 by Murdoch,
who wanted to expand and diversify the network's audience beyond
young people. This, said two former top employees, was a mistaken
calculation carried out in a difficult if not poisonous corporate
atmosphere that grinds away at executives.
</P>
<P>
   While rival television executives regard Grushow's new job as a
vindication for him after his most embarrassing professional
moment, Grushow brushed aside such notions.
</P>
<P>
   But one top television executive who knows him said: ``Sandy's a
driven, ambitious person who wants to rectify the one failure of
his life. He wants to purge that failure.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Grushow sounds characteristically confident that he can restore
Fox, although he acknowledges that television's declining audience
makes the task more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got dozens of cable networks today that didn't exist
before,'' he said. ``You've got the Internet. You've got networks
like the WB that have taken a page out of the Fox playbook and
virtually built a successful network on the back of that one genre,
young ensemble dramas. Today's very competitive environment makes
it harder than ever to stand out in the crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   Grushow has seen his way through competitive environments
before. When he took over as president of 20th Century Fox
Television in January 1997, the studio was the eighth-ranked
production company with five shows on the air. Today it is the top
provider of network programming with 20 shows.
</P>
<P>
   These include hits like ``The Practice'' and ``Dharma and Greg''
on ABC, ``Judging Amy'' and ``Chicago Hope'' on CBS, ``Ally
McBeal'' on Fox and ``Buffy, the Vampire Slayer'' on the WB
Network.
</P>
<P>
   Grushow's rivals at other networks said that he did not play
much of a role in creating many of these. More important, critics
said, many of these shows have yet to produce a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is probably unfair to diminish Grushow's achievement. It
was this success that led to his new job at the network, where the
president, Doug Herzog, now reports to him. Before he arrived,
there had been a 15 to 20 percent drop this season in ratings among
viewers ages 18 to 49. Herzog had staked a great deal on the dark
comedy ``Action,'' about a loathsome Hollywood producer, which was
canceled despite strong reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Chernin, Murdoch's No. 2 as president of the News Corp.
and Fox Entertainment, defended Herzog's stewardship and said
Grushow would be a partner in grappling with deep-seated problems.
</P>
<P>
   Grushow's critics call him impatient, sometimes brusque and
chilly, and as confident as he is ambitious. But a half dozen top
television executives and writer-producers described him as
creative both in marketing and in the development of shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a competitor, I'm not looking forward to working against
him,'' said Leslie Moonves, president and chief executive of CBS
Television. ``He's very tenacious, very respectful of the creative
community and knows which buttons to push in terms of promoting and
selling shows.''
</P>
<P>
   David E. Kelley, creator of ``Ally McBeal'' and ``The
Practice,'' observed that Grushow had a knack for understanding
what audiences wanted. ``He's a person I feel comfortable with at
the end of the day,'' he said. ``When you leave the room, you can
leave with a degree of assurance and trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Grushow, who was born in Queens and spent his teen-age years in
Los Angeles, where his father worked in the garment business, was
pushed into the television world against his will. His early career
was on the advertising and marketing side of Fox films until he was
transferred to the fledgling Fox Network, where he helped start
such signature series as ``The Simpsons,'' ``In Living Color,''
``Beverly Hills 90210'' and ``Cops.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his earliest innovations, now commonplace, was using
radio stations favored by teen-agers, African-Americans and other
market segments to promote pertinent Fox shows.
</P>
<P>
   So far in his new job, Grushow is trying to revamp two poorly
performing shows, the comedies ``Get Real'' and ``Time of Your
Life'' with Jennifer Love Hewitt. He has pledged to stay with them,
at least for the moment. He transferred the game show ``Greed,'' to
Friday night at 9, from Thursday night, to avoid colliding with
ABC's hugely successful ``Who Wants to be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   And he told Fox executives to cut back on the reality shows that
the network has used, almost embarrassingly, to increase ratings.
Among those that have been pulled are ``Celebrities Out of
Control'' and a show that depicted crashing a Boeing 747 in the
Mojave Desert with no one on the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may bring in big numbers, but at what cost from a branding
standpoint?'' Grushow asked. ``Frankly, I'd rather fail with
quality than succeed with junk.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he maintains that the Fox Studio will continue to
turn out successful programming for all networks, despite what some
agents and producers see as looming conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   What happens, for example, if a writer pitches a series that the
studio sells to another network, but the Fox Network then begins a
similar project?
</P>
<P>
   ``This can happen any day of the week, regardless of whether
you're overseeing both enterprises or not,'' he said. ``It's really
about the writer. We're pitched the same ideas repeatedly. The ones
that sneak through and become successful are the ones that are well
executed.''
</P>
<P>
   How the studio decides which shows to sell elsewhere and which
to keep for the network will often depend not only on the nature of
the subject matter but also on the relationships that writers and
producers have with various networks, Grushow said.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the moment I walked through the doors three years ago, I
knew that 20th Century Fox Television made the Fox Broadcasting Co.
its first priority,'' Grushow said. ``That being said, the goal
always was and is to produce as many successful series for as many
networks as possible. That hasn't changed.''
</P>
<P>
   At the network, he said, his goals were equally clear. ``The
long journey back has begun,'' he said.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: THE NEW AGE OF ANXIETY
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Jan. 2.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ All the talk about how the new millennium exposes
Americans to terrorist attacks brings to mind the tale about a man
who meets up with Death in the Baghdad bazaar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is not your friend with you today?'' asks Death. ``No, he had
a bad dream that he'd have a fatal fall if he stayed here. So he
fled to Samara to avoid it,'' the man replies.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's odd,'' answers Death. ``As it happens, tonight I have
an appointment in Samara.''
</P>
<P>
   Samara, as it happens, is in Iraq, the lair of Saddam Hussein, a
long-term bugaboo of U.S. governments. Saddam ranks high up on the
world's terrorist sponsors' list, along with Osama bin Laden, a
Saudi based in Afghanistan, and, until recently, Libya's Muammar
Qaddafi.
</P>
<P>
   Former Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn, an anti-terrorism expert, suggests
that Qaddafi might hire 25 bright computer hackers ``to plant
computer germs, to confuse critical computer networks, and to bring
down key nodes controlling America's infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   While Nunn admits he made that up, he nonetheless adds: ``It is
entirely plausible and may even be happening right now.'' Nunn's
object lesson: be ready to defend yourself against the unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   The same thought process led New York City officials to meet the
millennium by removing garbage cans from sidewalks, locking down
mailboxes, and banning parking in a 60-block area of Manhattan.
Their plan called for police helicopters to hover above while some
8,000 uniformed cops deployed and 300 plainclothes commandos
mingled with the festive New Year's Eve crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Why do governments take such extraordinary precautions, despite
scant intelligence of planned assaults? And why does the media go
along for the ride? Are there some political (or ratings) gains to
be had in raising human anxiety levels?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is two-fold.
</P>
<P>
   First, officials exercised what the lawyers call ``due
diligence.'' That means if something goes badly wrong, as it could,
then they'll be able to cite the manifold ways they had sought to
insure public safety.
</P>
<P>
   Second, officials believe that widely publicized warnings and a
massive show of force act as a deterrent to would-be bad guys and
thereby serve their purposes. As a bonus, the press portrays them
to a grateful audience as having done their job.
</P>
<P>
   Before Pan Am flight 103 blew up over Lockerbie, Scotland,
killing all 259 people aboard and 11 others on the ground, U.S.
agents suspected a retaliatory attack was planned. As a result,
some officials in the know didn't board the doomed plane. But no
public warning was issued, which thereafter enraged mourners.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, officials have vowed not to make that mistake again.
But that hasn't saved them from making other mistakes, such as the
recent mindless link between the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and a
heightened chance of terrorism from Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright.
</P>
<P>
   The just-ended century has taught us that life is not without
risk. The problem, as the hijacking of an Indian Airbus to
Afghanistan proves anew, is that only rarely do we know up front
where the real threats lie. While we may seek to avoid them, they
still could be lurking in Samara.

BARAK SAVES COALITION WITH 11TH HOUR DEAL
</HEADLINE>
  (With ISRAEL-LEBANON) 
(nk) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Resolving a potentially destabilizing political
crisis, Prime Minister Ehud Barak on Tuesday persuaded the
third-largest party in parliament to remain in his coalition by
offering increased funding and debt relief for its state-subsidized
religious schools.
</P>
<P>
   Shas, an ultra-Orthodox Sephardic party, dropped its plan to
withdraw from Barak's broad-based government when its brinkmanship
worked.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly six months of rocky relations with Barak, who
insisted that he would not be ``extorted,'' the religious party won
much of the money it was seeking just as its Cabinet ministers
prepared to tender their resignations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame that we had to rock the government, rock the
coalition and rock the world,'' said Yitzhak Suderi, the spokesman
for Shas, whose Sephardic constituency is of Middle Eastern and
North African descent. ``But in the end that's why we won this
battle.''
</P>
<P>
   Emerging from the Finance Ministry as the evening news began,
Eli Yishai, Shas' young leader, said calmly that an agreement had
been reached. Shas will vote for Barak's fiscally conservative
budget, he said after legislative deliberations began Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   With the agreement, Barak has escaped an 11th-hour crisis as his
budget goes to the parliament and he prepares to fly to the United
States in early January for the second round of talks with the
Syrians. Shas' support of the peace effort is vital to Barak's
plans.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Barak insisted that the prime minister had not
``capitulated,'' and that he was ``unmoved'' by the prospect of
Shas' withdrawal, which would have left him with a minority
government. The spokesman, Gadi Baltiansky, described the
horse-trading as business as usual when Israel's fractious,
sectarian parliament revs up for a budget vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a game known in advance,'' Baltiansky said. ``They always
threaten two minutes before the vote and reach an agreement one
minute before. Every year, it's the same. This year, compared with
the past, the political money is almost nonsignificant.''
</P>
<P>
   A political novice, Barak, a former general, had tuned out
advisers who counseled him to settle accounts with Shas early in
the fall. He tried to wait out Shas' political leaders, novices
themselves, saying he would not ``be budged.'' He left the
negotiations over the school system to the education minister,
Yossi Sarid, a leftist, saying he wanted to avoid trading public
funds for political support.
</P>
<P>
   Shas never gave up. And in the end, Shas appears to be getting
much of what it was requesting for its schools and its three
ministries. Whether the party, whose leadership is more dovish than
its constituency, will end up backing Barak's peace efforts remains
to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the agreement, Shas' troubled school system will
receive some $13 million to cover most of its $20 million in debts.
For next year's operating costs, it will also get $6.5 million more
than budgeted for its 14,000 pupils.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, Shas agreed to accept heightened state supervision
of its schools, allowing the Education Ministry to oversee its
secular curriculum and monitor the teaching credentials of its
staff. Shas, which was persuaded to dismiss its superintendent
earlier this year, also agreed to close 40 schools that are
severely under-enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   A senior official in the prime minister's office said, ``At the
end of the day, it was all reasonable numbers. Sarid got a lot of
things,'' referring to the education minister. Asked why the
reasonable numbers could not have been offered in the fall, the
official said, ``Sarid had to come around, too. And Shas had other
demands that were impossible, on the control side of things. Also,
they were asking for a lot more money.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the other ultra-Orthodox systems in Israel, the Shas
system, which is 10 years old, has operated autonomously. It has
steadily attracted more pupils by offering very small classes, long
days and hot meals, all of which make the schools costly to
operate. They have won adherents among the working poor to Shas'
religious and political agendas.
</P>
<P>
   But it has been plagued by mismanagement and corruption from the
start, as a scathing investigative report released last summer
showed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said to them, `If you want us to cover your deficit,
please, friends, place your house in order,''' said Rivka Shraga, a
spokeswoman for the Education Ministry. ``And that is what they
have finally agreed to do, after fighting us tooth and nail on the
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday afternoon, before the agreement was reached, Sarid said
the reforms that the ministry was imposing were so strict that Shas
was hesitating even after it was promised additional money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that Shas still has not accepted the agreement is the
best sign that we didn't blink first,'' Sarid said, calling it a
historic accord, because, ``for the first time Shas will act under
all the regulations of the ministry of education.''
</P>
<P>
   Shas' leaders, who have accused Sarid of maliciously trying to
destroy their school system, didn't accord him any victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yossi Sarid can claim whatever he wants but the final point is
that he capitulated because he had no choice,'' Yishai said. ``He
has no government without Shas.''
</P>
<P>
   During Barak's meeting with Yishai, the prime minister told him
that President Clinton had called to ask, ``What's with Shas?'' a
Shas spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Some participants in the negotiation and observers think that a
bank of ill feelings cannot be emptied overnight. Barak, they say,
miscalculated the long-term effect of sweating out his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Many Shas members and especially its rabbinic leaders feel they
have been humiliated by their public show-down with Barak's
government. And experts say that tensions are bound to re-surface,
and that Shas cannot be counted on as a reliable backer of Barak's
peacemaking effort.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, the party's spiritual leader, has spoken
bitterly of Barak this week, referring to him as ``despicable,''
according to a senior Israeli official.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shas has not always been treated as well as it should have
been,'' said Rabbi Melchior, a Cabinet minister and a member of
Barak's One Israel party. ``They needed to be treated as an
important part of the coalition not only because of peace with
Syria but because of internal strife in Israel. We need them for
finding solutions.''

EDITORS NOTE: Bay Area Classics profiles food-related businesses
more than a half century old.  BAY AREA CLASSICS: Ferrari's Stores Bring Italy to the Bay  
   
 By Karola Saekel  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  If Annibale Giovanni Ferrari could log on to
 www.agferrari.com  and witness the array of Italian food stuffs
his grandson, now chief executive officer/owner, Paul is offering _
in English and Italian _ to American consumers, he would surely be
baffled.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But if he could step into one of his offspring's nine Bay Area
A.G. Ferrari stores, he would feel right at home. While the variety
of Italian food and wine offered in these stores has increased
manifold, it is basically the same mix and guided by the same
philosophy as the store the young immigrant from Emilia-Romagna
opened 80 years ago in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, he called it Parisian Delicatessen since Italy was
not perceived as a gastronomically interesting country. But the
food was strictly Italian, and his grandson recalls him going to
the San Francisco to get it directly off the ships.
</P>
<P>
   Today, A.G. Ferrari company has its own office outside Florence,
with an agent working exclusively for the business.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the company's suppliers, says Paul Ferrari, are small,
artisanal producers who sell most of their production to Ferrari.
While they may have qualms about making such a commitment to a
company thousands of miles away, being able to conclude their
transactions in Italy and with an Italian agent is reassuring _ and
guarantees the Bay Area stores a steady flow of the kind of
non-mass-produced, traditional oils, pastas, dried mushrooms and
preserves that are Ferrari's stock in trade.
</P>
<P>
   Annibale Ferrari, son of the owner of a  &LR; gastronomia &LR;  (food
store) in Borgorato, a town renowned in Italy for its porcini, was
shipped off to the United States during World War I after his older
brother, Camillo, was killed in action. Father Rocco Ferrari argued
that losing one son was terrible enough so he put 16-year-old
Annibale on a ship bound for California.
</P>
<P>
   He would never return.
</P>
<P>
   The teenager worked at several jobs, including Bernstein's Fish
Grotto (now the site of Kuleto's on Powell Street), until he saved
enough money to open the San Jose  &LR; gastronomia &LR;  .
</P>
<P>
   He favored locations near a college or university because he
figured educated people were most likely to appreciate his
merchandise. This was true in San Jose and again a few years later
when he moved to Berkeley's Elmwood district, where the store was
known as Ultra Delicatessen.
</P>
<P>
   Annibale and, later, his son, Harold, were joined by several
relatives in the various stores they ran over the years. The
acquisition of a San Leandro deli named Lucca led to the name Ultra
Lucca, which continued until early last year when grandson Paul, at
the helm since his father's retirement in 1984, honored his late
grandfather _ and, not incidentally, set the store apart from other
local businesses named after the town of Lucca _ by changing the
name of his expanding deli empire to A.G. Ferrari.
</P>
<P>
   Today there are nine Ferrari stores _ two each in Berkeley,
Oakland and San Francisco; and one each in Corte Madera, Belmont
and Lafayette. A Danville store is set to open early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Ferrari has been encouraged to expand beyond the Bay Area,
but he is reluctant. Except for six trips to Italy each year, he
stays close to his stores _ something that would not be possible if
he went beyond the present geographic confines. And he wants not
only to honor his grandfather but to emulate him, and that means
staying in touch with his customers and spreading the philosophy of
Italian food and eating: Life is special and we should celebrate it
by eating well every day.

BEN AMES WILLIAMS JR., 84; VICE PRESIDENT AT BANK OF BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Ben Ames Williams Jr., retired senior vice president of
Bank of Boston and president of Old Colony Trust Co., died Dec. 21
in his home in Jamaica Plain. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Williams was born in Newton. He graduated from Dartmouth
College in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   He was employed briefly by the Boston Transcript and the Harold
Cabot Advertising Agency before joining Bank of Boston in 1941. He
remained with the company until his retirement in 1978, with the
exception of the years during World War II, when he served in the
Navy.
</P>
<P>
   He was a director of Arthur D. Little Co., a trustee of Thompson
Academy and served on the board of directors of Children's
Hospital, the Museum of Science, and the Boys and Girls Clubs of
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Williams enjoyed skiing, trout and salmon fishing, and
hunting game birds. He was the former president of The Country Club
in Brookline.
</P>
<P>
   As a senior fellow at Dartmouth, he wrote ``Mr. Secretary,'' a
novel about President Abraham Lincoln's secretary of war, that was
published in 1940. He also wrote a bicentennial history of the Bank
of Boston, which was published in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   In a column published in the Globe on Jan. 15, 1984, David Warsh
wrote that Mr. Williams's authorized history of the bank was ``a
fine research job on the way the Massachusetts Bank evolved into
the First National Bank of Boston and then into the Bank of Boston,
collecting old minutes and tracking the dividend over 200 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The columnist predicted the book would do well, ``for it affords
a splendid glimpse inside the world of an affable WASP living in a
realm that many people thought died with John P. Marquand.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Williams leaves his wife, Jessie Ames (Marshall); three
daughters, Jay Williams Howland of Jamaica Plain, Toby Williams
Woll of Wayland, and Susan Ames Williams of Portland, Maine; a
sister, Ann Williams Wardwell of Searsmont, Maine; and four
grandchildren.

 COOK'S BOOKS: Simplicity Permeates `Savoring France'  &HT;       
 By Karola Saekel 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; A new volume in the Williams-Sonoma/Time Life
``Savoring'' series of cookbooks could almost save you
transatlantic airfare and hotel bills. ``Savoring France'' not only
puts wonderfully original, regional recipes within kitchen reach,
but it conveys the essence of French culinary culture.
<P>
   Veteran cookbook author and food/garden writer Georgeanne
Brennan (and a regular Chronicle contributor) shares her personal
love of these traditions. Among them: the civilized custom of an
aperitif (which need not be alcoholic) creating a buffer between
the workday world and the leisurely lunch and dinner time; the
serving of  &LR; un go &LR; u &LR; ter &LR;  (beverage and a baked sweet or bread and
butter topped with chocolate) in late afternoon; and the natural
rhythm of meals that reflect the season and region.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan's view of French home cooking focuses on simplicity, and
she backs up her perception with recipes that are, for the most
part, uncomplicated. This is not labor-intensive three-star
restaurant fare, but food that ordinary people fix in their homes.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that the recipes sound tried-and-true. There
is an inherent sophistication in this cuisine. It may be partly the
legendary French thrift that has inspired cooks to use dandelion
greens, foraged wild figs, frogs and snails, but the end result is
a spectacularly varied menu.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan reports that French cooks pay as much attention _ if not
more _ to the starter as they do to the main part of the meal _ and
so does she.
</P>
<P>
   There are, to be sure, great entrees in this book, but it's the
first courses and side dishes that steal the show. It's hard to
pick favorites, although the  &LR; Tarte au Roquefort et &LR;   &LR; Tomates &LR;  _
buttery tart dough smeared with Roquefort cheese, thinned with
half-and-half and topped with sliced tomatoes sprinkled with
pepper, thyme and olive oil _ is a standout. But so are mussels in
white wine from Bretagne, sauteed garlic clams from Provence and a
superbly simple mushroom, celery and goat cheese salad from
Champagne.
</P>
<P>
   Cooks with more time on their hands _ and an adventurous streak
_ might try the Southwestern salad of greens dressed with walnut
oil and red wine vinegar and topped with a confit of poultry
gizzards.
</P>
<P>
   Main courses tend toward better-known classics _ a fine coq au
vin, delicate sole  &LR; meuni &LR; e &LR; re, &LR;  garlicky leg of lamb with potatoes
and onions, stick-to-the-ribs  &LR; choucroute garni &LR; . The inclusion of
a recipe for steak  &LR; frites &LR;  may seem to carry simplicity to the
point of being simplistic. Try this version from the Ile-de-France,
made with the best rib or rib-eye steaks you can find, and you will
reject any such notion.
</P>
<P>
   As one might expect of Brennan, who writes and gardens in Yolo
County when she is not at her farm in Provence, vegetable dishes
are lovely _ a scrumptious gratin of Belgian endive with ham and
Parmesan; creamed spinach with hard-cooked eggs; sauteed cucumbers
with dill, and braised celery hearts, to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   Desserts range from classics like cherry clafouti, tarte Tatin,
chocolate mousse,  &LR; baba au rhum &LR;  and walnut tart to the less
familiar fresh cheese with honey, tea-poached pears with star anise
and cloves, lavender-honey ice cream, and a prune and Armagnac
souffle.
</P>
<P>
   Sidebars on subjects such as aperitifs, honey or cooking with
cheese are entertaining and informative. A compact glossary helps
the novice to French cooking, though more listings of acceptable
substitutions would help.
</P>
<P>
   But one more thing about almost saving you a trip to France:
When you see the scenic photographs by Steven Rothfeld, you'll log
onto the Internet looking for the cheapest air fare even before you
even test your first recipe.

FRESH TOMATO TART WITH ROQUEFORT
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   Pastry
</P>
<P>
   1 cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup unsalted butter, chilled, cut into 1/2-inch chunks
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons ice water
</P>
<P>
   Filling
</P>
<P>
   6 ounces Roquefort cheese, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons half-and-half or milk
</P>
<P>
   2 tomatoes, sliced 1/4 inch thick
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon minced fresh thyme
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   To make the pastry, in a bowl, stir together the flour and salt.
Using a pastry blender or 2 knives, cut in the butter until
pea-size balls form. Add the ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time
while turning the dough lightly with a fork and then with your
fingertips. (Do not overwork or it will become tough.) Gather the
crumbly dough into a ball, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for
15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat an oven to 400 degrees. On a floured work surface, roll
out the dough into a round about 101/2 inches in diameter and about
1/4 inch thick. Carefully transfer to a 9-inch tart pan with a
removable bottom and 1/2-inch sides. Pat into the bottom and sides
and trim the edge even with the rim.
</P>
<P>
   In a small bowl, using a fork, mash the cheese together with the
half-and-half or milk. Spread evenly over the bottom of the pastry.
Cover with the tomato slices in a tightly packed single layer.
Sprinkle with the pepper, thyme and olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   Bake until the crust is lightly golden and the tomatoes have
collapsed, 20-25 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let stand for 30
minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6 to 8.

EDITORS NOTE: Each week, wine editor Gerald Boyd discusses a
variety of wine topics.  WINE POTPOURRI: Refining the Art of Dining  
   
 By Gerald D. Boyd  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Hang around the wine and food businesses long
enough and a few things become apparent. The most obvious thing is
the difference between eating and dining. Eating is simply the act
of fueling up to stay alive, while dining is a life experience.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the Chronicle wine tasting panel had its
annual holiday dinner at Aqua restaurant in San Francisco. It would
be easy to dismiss most of the activity swirling around matching
food and wine as too precious, but our meal at Aqua clearly defined
the art of dining, as well as the art of food and wine pairing.
</P>
<P>
   The annual meal offers the opportunity to pair special wines
brought by each panel member with food, rather than simply tasting
wines in a structured setting. The challenge was to select wines
from our personal collections that would complement Aqua chef
Michael Mina's creative food, presented in six courses.
</P>
<P>
   From a visual perspective, we all think we know art when we see
it, or at least what we think of as art. Tasting is the same.
Mina's parfait of Russian caviar on a crisp potato cake was a
mismatch with an oaky California Chardonnay and didn't quite work
with the up-front fruitiness of a Viognier, but was harmonious with
an Australian dry Riesling. Viognier and Riesling have similar
fruit profiles, so why did one work and the other didn't? We
couldn't explain it.
</P>
<P>
   Later, a pumpkin and lobster souffle with a side mini-pot of
butternut squash stew matched nicely with the Viognier, as well as
with an Alsatian Riesling. But it was Aqua's signature Surf and
Turf _ tangerine glazed breast of squab, diver scallops, foie gras
and cipollini onion tartlet _ that presented the most possibilities
for an artful wine and food match. A trio of Pinot Noirs _ one each
from Oregon, Sonoma and Burgundy _ brought the complex flavors
forward without overpowering them.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; You Never Know &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Wine writer and educator Ronn Weigand, his wife Brenda Boblitt
and their two sons were involved in a serious automobile accident
earlier this month. Weigand and Boblitt are the publishers of
``Restaurant Wine,'' a popular guide to fine wines, wine service
and the wine marketing in restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   While the boys' injuries were not serious, Weigand and Boblitt
face several operations and months of rehabilitation. Insurance and
medical coverage do not begin to cover the mounting medical bills.
To help, the wine industry is pulling together by hosting the Ronn
Weigand Family Dinner and Wine Auction, February 4 at the Culinary
Institute of America's Greystone Barrel Room in St. Helena. The
event is being underwritten by The Wine Spectator.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets to the dinner and auction are $250 per person and may be
obtained by sending a check, payable to the Weigand Family Fund, to
1200 Jefferson St., Napa 94559. Charitable contributions may also
be made directly to the Weigand Family Fund, Bank of the West, 3300
Jefferson St., Napa 94558, Account no. 094268174. For more
information, call (707) 255-3310.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Wine Basics &LR;
</P>
<P>
   With only a few days before the new year, thousands of bottles
of Champagne and other sparkling wines are going on ice for what
could be the biggest mass toast of all time. Here's how that
sparkling wine was made.
</P>
<P>
   When sparkling wine ferments in the bottle, it forms a deposit.
 &LR; Remuage &LR; , a French term, is the removal of that deposit. When done
by hand, the bottles are placed neck first into a rack, called a
 &LR; pupitre &LR; , then given a quarter-turn and a slight shake to loosen
the deposit. This process is called riddling. After a few months of
riddling, the bottle is nearly vertical in the rack and the deposit
has moved to the neck of the bottle. The deposit is removed by
 &LR; degorgement &LR; , or ``throat clearing'' in French. The plug of
sediment is frozen in the neck of the bottle, then the temporary
crown cap (like a soda bottle cap) is removed. The plug shoots out,
a measure of  &LR; liqueur d'expedition &LR;  (sweetened wine or cane syrup)
is added according to the degree of sweetness required.
</P>
<P>
   The bottle is then corked, the wire net is twisted in place and
the hood is placed over the cork. Happy New Year!

supermarkets.  
 
 TASTER'S CHOICE: It's a Year For Winners At Markets   By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  From chocolate-covered caramels for Valentine's
Day to turkey for Thanksgiving, The Chronicle's tasting panel found
much to like in 1999. But tasting wasn't just for holidays _ the
panel also picked winners in everyday products like brown sugar,
milk and fresh-squeezed orange juice.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The panel of food professionals (chefs, cookbook authors and
food consultants) chose  &UR; Safeway ketchup &LR;  and  &UR; Diestel Ranch fresh &LR; 
 &UR; turkeys &LR;  as winners for this year's highest-ranked product.
</P>
<P>
   Both milk tastings _ whole and nonfat _ also yielded high
rankings, but not from the same dairy.  &UR; Lucerne &LR;  won the whole milk
category; one panelist described it as ``picture perfect for
taste.''  &UR; Clover Stornetta &LR;  took top honors in nonfat milk.
</P>
<P>
   Other top ranking products include  &UR; Oroweat sliced whole wheat &LR; 
 &UR; bread &LR; ,  &UR; Nestle semisweet chocolate chips &LR; ,  &UR; Louis Rich Carving &LR; 
 &UR; Board packaged sliced chicken breast &LR; ,  &UR; Brown &AMP; Haley &LR; 
 &UR; chocolate-covered caramels &LR; ,  &UR; C&AMP;H brown sugar &LR; ,  &UR; Mollie Stone's &LR; 
 &UR; fresh squeezed orange juice, Tom's chocolate chip cookie dough, &LR; 
 &UR; Mrs. Fanning's bread and butter pickles &LR;  and  &UR; Niman Ranch &LR; 
 &UR; steaks &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   The tasting of  &UR; tortilla chips &LR;  _ which included a whopping 13
brands _ produced a tie between big name  &UR; Doritos and Padrinos &LR; ,
both of which outranked many organic and locally-made chips. But
the tasting wasn't without dissenters: two panelists prefer thicker
cut chips like  &UR; Native &LR; . However, they were outvoted by the other
three who like thin, crisp chips.

   Another surprise came in the  &UR; hamburger bun &LR;  tasting. The panel
didn't reach a consensus on taste, but  &UR; Wonder's &LR;  buns edged out
popular  &UR; Cake Box &LR;  buns by a slight margin. One panelist described
Wonder as ``very backyard barbecue American.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost as interesting as what panelists liked is what they
didn't. The group found some categories, particularly meat bolognas
and low-fat Caesar salad dressing, to lack any respectable
contenders. And while they selected a winner in categories such as
frozen potstickers, yellow cake mix and California rolls from
supermarkets, they agreed that the majority of these products
needed vast improvement.

 LEARNING TO COOK: No Chafing Dish? Try Baking a Fondue   By Marion Cunningham  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  Many young cooks have never heard of fondue, but
it was wildly popular during the 1960s, and with good reason. This
Swiss national dish was a breeze to prepare _ you didn't have to
know much about cooking _ and it was fun to eat.
<P>
   All the cooks I knew had a chafing dish expressly for making and
serving fondue. It consisted of diced cheese (usually Gruyere) and
white wine. The chafing dish would first be rubbed with garlic,
then the cheese and wine would go in heated gently until melted.
</P>
<P>
   A loaf of french bread would be cut into cubes and set alongside
the chafing dish in the center of the table. Then everyone would
spear a bread cube on a long-handled fork and dunk the bread into
the fondue in the chafing dish.
</P>
<P>
   Usually a salad would be served on the side. My favorite salad
was a mix of iceberg and butter lettuce leaves with a simple oil
and vinegar dressing.
</P>
<P>
   Because everyone sold their chafing dishes in 1970s garage
sales, it's not easy to resurrect the classic fondue. But here's a
baked casserole that features the same flavors _ if not the same
technique. The bread and cheese are all in one and cut into squares
to serve, like a strata.
</P>
<P>
   But just maybe this will inspire you to consider buying a fondue
set so you can repeat the pleasure of the original classic.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BAKED FONDUE
</P>
<P>
   This recipe is similar to a strata, a savory bread pudding, and
it can be prepared well before baking. Accompany with a salad.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 clove garlic
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   4 slices white bread
</P>
<P>
   1 cup grated sharp Cheddar cheese (about 6 ounces)
</P>
<P>
   2 eggs
</P>
<P>
   2 cups milk
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   3/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Use a 7 x 11 x 2-inch baking
dish or pan. Peel the papery skin off the clove of garlic. Rub the
bottom and sides of the baking pan with the garlic, rubbing back
and forth over the pan so the garlic coats the entire surface.
</P>
<P>
   Lightly spread 2 tablespoons of the butter gently over the
garlic-coated bottom and sides.
</P>
<P>
   Spread the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter over the 4 slices
of bread. Place the slices in one layer over the bottom of the
baking pan. If they are too large for the pan, trim the slices to
fit the pan. Divide the grated cheese into 4 parts and sprinkle the
top of each slice of bread evenly with the grated cheese. Set
aside.
</P>
<P>
   Crack the eggs into a bowl; add the milk, Dijon mustard, salt
and ground black pepper. Use a hand rotary beater, whisk or
electric mixer to beat the mixture until it is completely blended
and all one color.
</P>
<P>
   Pour the egg mixture evenly over the slices of bread in the pan.
Let the mixture sit for 30 minutes. This lets the bread soak up the
egg mixture, which flavors the whole dish.
</P>
<P>
   Bake the dish about 30 minutes, until it is golden and puffy.
Serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Note: &LR;  If you want to prepare this early in the day or the
night before baking, cover the dish with plastic wrap and
refrigerate. If you are using a metal pan, preheat the oven and and
bake it 30 minutes. If you are using a glass or Pyrex baking dish
and it has been refrigerated, put it into a cold oven, then turn on
the heat so the dish heats gradually and won't break. Bake about 40
minutes. The top should be golden and puffy.

VIDEO EDITING FIRMS ANNOUNCE MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
 ORIGIN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MEG VAILLANCOURT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Media 100 Inc., a Marlborough, Mass. company that sells video
editing software, said Tuesday it has agreed to buy a California
software firm for $90 million in stock.
</P>
<P>
   Both Media 100 and Digital Origin Inc. of Mountain View, Calif.,
specialize in software and systems that allow consumers to edit
video and audio and distribute it over the Internet _ a process
known as ``streaming.''
</P>
<P>
   The combined company's products would allow personal computer
users to shoot home movies, edit them, mix sound, add effects and
then put them on the Internet to share with relatives and friends,
company officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today every college has its own radio station,'' said John
Molinari, Media 100 chief executive. ``Now, with the combined
technology, every college will be able to have its own television
station using the Internet, (digital) camcorders, a desktop
computer and a few hundred bucks of software.''
</P>
<P>
   Media 100 stock closed unchanged at 27 a share. But some
analysts were more enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great buy opportunity,'' said Gene Munster, an analyst
with USBancorp Piper Jaffray. ``Capturing and distributing video
via the Internet is the next hottest thing. Now Media 100 will be
the key technology for consumers who want to put video on the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the agreement, which still must be approved
by shareholders of both companies, Media 100 will issue roughly
half a share of its common stock for each share of Digital Origin
common stock. Media 100 is also slated to pay royalties for the use
of Digital Origin's software.
</P>
<P>
   While Media 100 produces more expensive, high-end media
production tools that are marketed to professionals including Web
site designers, universities, and corporations, Digital Origin has
focused on lower-end users like consumers who record home videos on
their camcorders.
</P>
<P>
   The parties plan to integrate their software to deliver
consumer-level video editing and streaming tools to Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to make everyone with a personal computer a
potential Internet video broadcaster,'' said Mark Housley, chairman
and chief executive of Digital Origin.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials said that because the newly combined software
will be compatible with all three of the dominant multimedia
systems from Microsoft, Apple and RealNetworks _ consumers will be
able to access and distribute video regardless of which system it
was originally recorded on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be the first company to offer fully integrated
Internet video production using all three competetive formats,''
Molinari said.

EDITORS NOTE: Here's a plan for getting quick meals on the table in
a hurry. Now &AMP; Later is a recipe cooked on the weekend in batches _
enough to serve 12 _ and functions as dinner on the night it's
prepared; freeze the rest for two future meals. The 30-Minute
Recipe takes a half-hour or less of preparation and Fast and
Fresh.  THE WORKING COOK: Oaxacan Memories Inspire Steamed Snapper Dish  
   
 By Tara Duggan  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  It was just a snack shack on the beach in Puerto
Angel, a fishing village on the coast of Oaxaca, Mexico. By day, we
sat on wooden beach chairs, ordered a Corona or two, and waded into
the warm waters of the protected cove.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ernesto, a waiter who had cajoled us into sitting on his part of
the beach ever since the first day of our trip talked us into
coming back for dinner to try the local fish.
</P>
<P>
   We arrived after dark and found the place empty _ it was the
rainy season, after all. Ernesto led us to a plastic table under a
thatched roof, lighting a single tiki lantern. Our table was just
10 feet shy of the water.
</P>
<P>
   We had snapper prepared two ways: one in the traditional  &LR; al &LR; 
 &LR; mojo de ajo &LR;  style, fried in butter and garlic; the other enclosed
the fish in a steaming foil packet with cilantro and thin wedges of
potato, tomato and onion. The just-tender vegetables and buttery
fish settled in a rich broth with a hint of citrus.
</P>
<P>
   Though Oaxaca has wonderful food, this was our best meal. Maybe
it was because we were amazed to find a taco stand that could
produce such a meal. Of course, the fact that we were celebrating
our first week of marriage probably didn't hurt, either.
</P>
<P>
   I've re-created this memorable meal as a 30-Minute Main Dish.
The great thing about cooking fish  &LR; en papillote &LR;  is that you don't
have to worry about it drying out, though it can still become
slightly rubbery if overcooked.
</P>
<P>
   The main trick is blanching the potatoes ahead of time; they
take forever to cook inside the foil package.
</P>
<P>
   The Fast &AMP; Fresh recipe, a warm pasta salad, is festive for the
holidays with ruby-red pomegranate seeds and shining baby spinach
leaves. A Champagne vinaigrette adds a bright note to the
sweet-tart pomegranates, and the penne, goat cheese and walnuts
make it a substantial main course salad.
</P>
<P>
   The Hearty Celery Root and Potato Soup is very simple to make;
the only time-consuming aspect is chopping the vegetables. It's a
thick and satisfying soup with subtle nuances of leek and purfume-y
celery root.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
FAST &AMP; FRESH: dinner in about 20 minutes

<P>
   WARM PASTA SALAD WITH SPINACH, POMEGRANATE, WALNUTS &AMP; GOAT
CHEESE
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   41/2 tablespoons champagne vinegar
</P>
<P>
   3/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 pound penne rigati (grooved) pasta
</P>
<P>
   1 pomegranate
</P>
<P>
   1/2 red onion
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup walnuts
</P>
<P>
   1 (10-ounce) bag prewashed spinach
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup crumbled goat cheese
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Begin bringing a large pot of salted water to a boil.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the vinegar, salt and pepper in a bowl. Whisk in the
oil.
</P>
<P>
   When the water boils, add the pasta and cook according to
package directions.
</P>
<P>
   While the pasta cooks, quarter the pomegranate by lightly
scoring through the skin (not the fruit) with a paring knife.
Separate into quarters by holding the fruit in a bowl of water and
slowly pulling the segments apart. Working one segment at a time,
remove the seeds under water. The white pith will float to the top
while the seeds sink to the bottom. Discard the skin and pith and
drain the seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Slice the onion thinly, and coarsely chop the walnuts.
</P>
<P>
   Drain the pasta and transfer to a large salad bowl. Toss with
half of the dressing. Add the spinach and toss again until the
leaves are wilted. Toss in the pomegranate seeds, red onion,
walnuts and goat cheese. Drizzle on remaining dressing as desired,
then toss again. Serve warm.

</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons lime juice
</P>
<P>
   4 teaspoons dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Begin bringing a medium pot of
salted water to a boil.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the potatoes into very thin slices. Add them to the boiling
water and blanch until just tender, about 4 minutes. Drain.
</P>
<P>
   Thinly slice the onion; trim off the cilantro stems. Season the
fish with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Place 2 or 3 large sheets of aluminum foil (depending on the
number of fillets), about 12 x 16 inches each, on the counter. Rub
some of the butter on each piece of foil, leaving a 1-inch border
around the edges.
</P>
<P>
   Place a portion of onion slices, potato slices and cilantro
sprigs on one half of each piece of the foil. Season vegetables
with salt and pepper. Place a fish fillet on each pile of
vegetables. Drizzle with lime juice and wine, then layer with the
remaining vegetables and cilantro. Season again, and dot with
remaining butter.
</P>
<P>
   For each packet, bring the clean half of the foil over the fish,
then starting at one corner, fold and crimp the edges to seal
tightly.
</P>
<P>
   Place the packages on a large baking sheet and bake until the
fish is flakes, about 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, carefully cut open the foil packages with a pair of
scissors, minding the hot steam. Transfer the fish and vegetables
to serving bowls and top with the juices. Serve with extra lime
wedges, if desired.

</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   4 large leeks (white and tender light-green part only)
</P>
<P>
   1 celery root
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons butter, cut into small pieces
</P>
<P>
   8 white potatoes
</P>
<P>
   8 cups chicken or vegetable stock
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon freshly ground white pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Slice leeks in half lengthwise and rinse under cold running
water until all sand is gone. Thinly slice leeks against the grain.
</P>
<P>
   Using a large, sharp knife, trim the rough ends squarely off the
celery root. Place flat-end down on a cutting board and carefully
trim off the remaining skin in thin strips from top to bottom. Cut
the white flesh into large dice.
</P>
<P>
   Melt the butter in a large, heavy stockpot over low heat. Add
the leeks and celery root and saute until softened but not browned,
stirring often, about 12 to 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   While the vegetables cook, peel and cut the potatoes into large
dice.
</P>
<P>
   Add the potatoes, stock, salt and white pepper to the pot. Bring
to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes, until tender.
</P>
<P>
   Strain out liquids from solids, reserving both. Working in
batches, puree the solids with a few cups of the liquid in a
blender or food mill until mostly smooth but still slightly chunky.
Return the puree to the stockpot and combine with the liquid. Add
the cream and heat through. Adjust seasoning.

 COOK'S BOOKS: Tra Vigne's Approach Focuses on the Earth
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Nicholas Bundy &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; Special to The Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; ST. HELENA, Calif. _  &LR; At St. Helena's celebrated Tra Vigne
restaurant in the Napa Valley, chef/owner Michael Chiarello's rich,
hearty Italian cooking is inspired by generations of his family who
worked the land in Calabria in southern Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's gathered his recipes and documented his approach in
``The Tra Vigne Cookbook: Seasons in the California Wine Country.''
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Chiarello draws on his sumptuous culinary heritage
_ his father's homemade wine, his grandfather's home-cured
prosciutto, his mother's vegetable garden _ to create a distinctive
cuisine that is rich with tradition and seasonality.
</P>
<P>
   Chiarello stays true to his heritage by organizing the book by
seasons. Each season is represented by four of his favorite
vegetables at their peak during that time of year. Winter, for
example, features broccoli, artichokes, citrus and squash. And in
many recipes, like Lemon-Braised Artichokes, and Soft Polenta with
Pancetta and Broccoli Rabe, the listed vegetables can easily be
changed to seasonal ones.
</P>
<P>
   His philosophy? The closer your cooking stays to the seasons,
the simpler _ and better _ the food will be.
</P>
<P>
   To boost the home cook's confidence, Chiarello has included
several ``master'' recipes that incorporate techniques to add to
your ``tool kit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You only need to learn one recipe in order to add several new
dishes to your repertoire,'' Chiarello writes.
</P>
<P>
   The cookbook's title, ``Tra Vigne,'' means ``among the vines''
in Italian, and the feeling of the Italian countryside is recreated
with seasonal delights like Savory Swordfish with Sweet and Sour
Onion, Raisin and Tomato Agrodolce, as well as Tra Vigne restaurant
classics such as Herb Gnocchi with Braised Lamb Shanks and Wild
Mushrooms and Chocolate Tiramisu.
</P>
<P>
   The hardcover volume features photographs of the stunning Napa
countryside in every season, meals prepared at the restaurant, and
aerial views of the vineyards.
</P>
<P>
   The book, with its beautiful design and evocative recipes, would
make a treasured addition to a kitchen bookshelf. And though
perfecting many of Chiarello's recipes requires patience from a
novice home cook, the results will leave guests with a smile.

SWORDFISH WITH ONION, RAISINS &AMP; TOMATO AGRODOLCE
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   31/2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   5 cups thinly sliced onions
</P>
<P>
   Salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup water
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh rosemary
</P>
<P>
   1 can (141/2 ounces) chopped tomatoes, or 11/2 cups peeled and
chopped vine-ripened tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup golden raisins
</P>
<P>
   Freshly grated zest of 1 lemon
</P>
<P>
   Juice of 1/2 lemon
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
</P>
<P>
   4 swordfish steaks, about 7 ounces each, at least 1 inch thick
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons panko or other dried breadcrumbs
</P>
<P>
   Lemon wedges
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large saute pan over
medium heat until hot. Add the onions and a little salt so the
onions release their liquid. Reduce the heat to medium-low and
saute until the onions stop releasing liquid and the pan is nearly
dry again, about 4 minutes. Do not allow the onions to brown. Add
the water, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions
are very soft, about 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Uncover, season with salt and pepper, add the rosemary, and
increase the heat to medium-high. Saute until the onions are very
lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Remove half of the onions to a
plate and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Add the tomatoes and their juice to the onions remaining in the
pan. Bring to a boil over high heat, season with salt and pepper,
lower the heat and simmer until thick, about 4 minutes. Add the
sugar and the raisins and stir in the lemon zest and lemon juice.
Remove from the heat and let cool for a bit. Stir in 1 tablespoon
of the parsley. Keep warm. (The recipe may be completed up to this
point a day ahead. Cover and refrigerate the reserved onions and
sauce separately.)
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Turn on the broiler, if a
separate unit.

   Heat the remaining 11/2 tablespoons olive oil in a large,
ovenproof saute pan over medium-high heat until hot. Season the
fish steaks with salt and pepper and place in the pan. Lower the

<P>
   To serve, reheat the sauce, if necessary. It should be warm, not

E-COMMERCE RETAILERS SEEK WAYS TO IMPROVE SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With big holiday sales and some bungled orders behind them,
e-commerce retailers are already looking for ways to improve the
on-line shopping experience.
</P>
<P>
   Retail Web sites must become easier for consumers to use, and
many merchants must do a better job of ensuring that the right
merchandise arrives on time, e-commerce strategists say.
</P>
<P>
   Merchandise didn't arrive on time for Massachusetts businessman
Dave Regan. In early December, Regan said, he and his wife ordered
toys from a Web site operated by Toys ``R'' Us. But a few days
before Christmas, they were notified that presents they thought
they had bought for their daughter wouldn't arrive on time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unconscionable,'' Regan said of the late notice. ``How
do you explain that to an 11-year-old?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not shopping with them ever again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Toysrus.com cited high demand and said up to 5
percent of its orders would not arrive by Christmas. A spokeswoman
noted that the company took several steps to rectify such errors,
including issuing gift certificates.
</P>
<P>
   The episode raises a question about e-commerce shopping
strategy. After consumers have placed an order at a retail Web
site, can they passively wait and assume it will arrive? Or should
they revisit the Web site several times, either to look for
warnings about late deliveries or to use features that let them
track the progress of the order until its arrival?
</P>
<P>
   ``My error was I trusted they would do what they said they would
do,'' Regan said of Toys ``R'' Us.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such issues, on-line holiday sales boomed in 1999,
though profits remain elusive. With many consumers finding it
easier to buy on line than to brave crowded malls, on-line holiday
sales could hit $12 billion, far above 1998's $3 billion. Final
results won't be known for a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists say anecdotes about orders gone wrong don't tell the
whole story.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unclear how big the problem was'' and how it compares to
hassles that consumers endure in the brick-and-mortar world, said
Charles Gerlach, director of eStrategy at Mainspring Communications
Inc. in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a new survey of Internet users conducted by PC Data
Online and Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. found that 97 percent of the
respondents said that their on-line experience met or exceeded
expectations, the Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   According to conventional wisdom, the last few months of 1999
were a rare opportunity for e-commerce merchants to grab market
share at the dawn of what many see as a new retail era.
</P>
<P>
   Afraid that slow starters would lose out, a land-rush mentality
set in that had many e-commerce retailers throwing money at big TV
ad campaigns. With promises of discounts and free shipping, the ads
drove consumers to the Internet, but not all Web sites were
prepared to handle the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   As the recent decline in stock shares of Internet retailers
suggests, Toysrus.com wasn't the only Web site that appeared
unprepared for the holiday rush.
</P>
<P>
   Katie Kelly, a mother who works for a marketing firm, was among
those disappointed. In mid-December, she said she ordered several
hundred dollars worth of gifts from eToys Inc.
</P>
<P>
   When the order didn't arrive at the prescribed time, she said
she made several attempts to reach eToys by phone, once waiting on
hold for nearly an hour. Finally, a package arrived, but instead of
the expensive model airplane she had ordered for one of her sons,
it was ``a $3 snap toy,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   A call to eToys was not returned. In general, eToys has received
high marks from groups that rate e-commerce Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   In the inevitable shakeout ahead, the retail Web sites most
likely to be casualties are the ones that disappointed the biggest
share of their customers _ and there are more chances to disappoint
customers this week as on-line retailers grapple with the returns
and exchanges that come after Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   A debate is now under way about what surviving on-line retailers
will look like. Some think the retailer of the future will operate
both stores and a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   This combination not only yields efficiencies but offers another
advantage. Some consumers are reluctant to shop at Web sites run by
a retailer they've never heard of. But they'll buy on line from
retailers that operate stores where they have shopped.
</P>
<P>
   After her bad experience with eToys, which has no stores, Kelly
said she'll never again buy anything from a Web retailer that
doesn't have a presence in the physical world.
</P>
<P>
   Even for a retailer with a long brick-and-mortar history,
e-commerce can be humbling, as Toys ``R'' Us found out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their management philosophy is not set up for handling
e-commerce,'' said Regan, the father whose order failed to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   As they deal with customer complaints, on-line retailers face a
dilemma. Should they operate their own warehouses as a way to
minimize errors? (That seems to be the plan of Amazon.com.) Or
should they outsource warehouse operations to third parties in an
attempt to keep costs low?
</P>
<P>
   One issue nearly all on-line merchants may have to deal with is
making their Web sites easier to use. Surveys show many sites are
drawing heavy traffic, but in some cases, only a small percentage
of visitors actually make a purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps these consumers can't find enough information about a
product they want to buy; or maybe some shoppers get frustrated
with their attempts to navigate around the site and give up.
Whatever the reason, the merchant loses a potential sale.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce such problems, more sites are offering instant e-mail
messaging features that allow a shopper and a customer service
representative to communicate in real time.
</P>
<P>
   With its ``Lands' End Live'' feature, a consumer with two phone
lines can browse the Landsend.com site while consulting with a
service rep on the phone. The rep can send images of merchandise
that appear on the shopper's PC screen.
</P>
<P>
   Such features, first pioneered by Web sites that sell computer
equipment, may grow more common as mainstream on-line consumers go
beyond buying commodity items such as books to more complex
products such as DVD players and satellite dishes.
</P>
<P>
   At Roxy.com, a Marlborough, Mass. retail Web site that sells
consumer electronics, customers can type in questions and have them
answered by a live voice that responds through the speakers of a
customer's personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the very early stages of interactivity in
e-commerce,'' said Roxy.com chief executive Michael Jeans.
</P>
<P>
   As interactivity improves, so too should customer satisfaction
with retail Web sites, specialists said.
</P>
<P>
   Regan, the Newton, Mass. father, may feel he was burned by
Toysrus.com. But even that bad encounter may not discourage him
from shopping on line again. The convenience is too compelling, he
said, and the service was good at Amazon.com and Jjill.com, two
other retail Web sites he shopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a big advocate of this,'' Regan said. ``The concept of
e-commerce is really good.''

 SECRETS OF SUCCESS: Richard Crocker's Innovative Waffle   By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  I have a confession to make: I'm not wild about
brunch. If I have to review a brunch place, I generally try to go
late enough so I can segue into lunch. Brunch dishes simply don't
excite me.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But I was totally captivated by the Caramelized Onion Waffle
With Smoked Salmon and Radish Salad at Kelly's Mission Rock. It's
one of the most innovative dishes I've seen in some time. And to
enjoy it on the wood deck overlooking the Bay Bridge is absolutely
magical.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us don't have that kind of view at home, but the waffle
part of the equation is easy for the home cook. First, caramelized
onions are added to the waffle batter. Then, when the hot, crisp
waffle comes off the iron, it's paved with smoked salmon and
drizzled with lemon cream. The waffle is crowned with a
well-dressed knob of frisee, endive, radish sprouts and radishes.
</P>
<P>
   The waffle is the handiwork of Kelly's opening chef, Richard
Crocker, who worked for five years at Boulevard before leaving in
1998 to open the redo of Mission Rock Resort. The once-seedy but
always-popular place was taken over by Jim Kelly, former owner of
Pat O'Shea's. He revamped the entire structure with an
industrial-meets-nautical look, which sets the right tone for being
on a working wharf.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Kelly's Mission Rock, 817 China Basin (near Illinois), San &LR; 
 &LR; Francisco; (415) 626-5355. Open for lunch Tuesday-Friday, &LR;   &LR; dinner
Tuesday-Saturday, brunch Saturday-Sunday. &LR;

<P>

<P>
   &UR; _ The waffles.  &LR; Adding the caramelized onions to the waffles
and topping them with smoked salmon is a brilliant idea.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ The salad.  &LR; Well dressed and cool, the salad creates a
wonderful counterpoint to the hot crisp waffle and the silky, salty
salmon.

 Top 10 Bay Area Food Events of Century   By Kim Severson  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _ 1900:  Chop suey, invented a few years earlier by a
San Francisco Chinese cook who served leftover vegetables, meat and
noodles to a group of drunken gold miners, gains popularity. It's
the beginning of the influence of Asian food and is the forerunner
of modern fusion cooking.
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; 1914: &LR;  The crab cocktail is invented by Tomaso Castagnola in
Fisherman's Wharf. The event represents the Bay Area's love affair
with the Dungeness crab, which remains an enduring culinary icon.
The crabbing industry, which began just before the Gold Rush,
boomed around the turn of the century and peaked in the late 1950s,
when 8.4 million pounds were brought in.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1922: &LR;  Italian farmers begin growing artichokes commercially
along the San Mateo, Santa Cruz and Monterey county coasts.
Artichokes become a signature California vegetable, and secures the
role of Italian immigrants in creating the Bay Area's strong
reputation for top-drawer produce.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1933: &LR;  The state legislature approves the Central Valley
Project, which would become a federally built water system designed
to sustain California agriculture. The first water deliveries to
farmers in the San Joaquin Valley wouldn't come until 18 years
later and cost the state several of its natural salmon runs, but
the commitment to irrigation makes California the nation's leading
agricultural state.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1946:  &LR; Thomas Edmund Cara opens the first shop in North Beach
selling espresso machines. Today, there are thousands of espresso
bars in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1965: &LR;  Fritz Maytag, of the washing machine and cheese family,
buys the near-dead Anchor Brewing Co. and dedicates himself to
reviving America's hand-crafted beer tradition. Its signature beer,
Anchor Steam, sparked the nation's microbrew explosion.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1973: &LR;  A group of 90 farmers form the California Certified
Organic Farmers association. Six years later, the state legislature
passes the Organic Food Law, and California becomes the first state
to actively enforce proper use of the organic label. Today's debate
over irradiated and genetically modified foods has its roots in the
early organic movement.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1976:  &LR; Chefs Alice Waters and Jeremiah Tower prepare a
California regional dinner at Chez Panisse in Berkeley. The event
signifies the birth of California cuisine, a style of cooking and
eating that set the agenda for the regional food phenomenon in
America.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1976 &LR; : Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 1973 Cabernet Sauvignon and
Chateau Montelena's 1973 Napa Valley Chardonnay beat out French
competitors in a highly publicized wine tasting in Paris. The
state's wine industry gains instant worldwide acclaim and the
California wine boom begins, guided by the internationally
respected enology program at the University of California at Davis.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1979: &LR;  Laura Chenel begins making goat cheese, launching a
revolution in American cheesemaking. It marks a revival of artisan
food production in Northern California, which includes, among
others, bread bakers and specialty vegetable growers.

BEN AMES WILLIAMS JR., 84; BANK VP, AUTHOR

 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Ben Ames Williams Jr., retired senior vice president of
Bank of Boston and president of Old Colony Trust Co., died Dec. 21
in his home in Jamaica Plain. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Williams was born in Newton. He graduated from Dartmouth
College in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   He was employed briefly by the Boston Transcript and the Harold
Cabot Advertising Agency before joining Bank of Boston in 1941. He
remained with the company until his retirement in 1978, with the
exception of the years during World War II, when he served in the
Navy.
</P>
<P>
   He was a director of Arthur D. Little Co., a trustee of Thompson
Academy and served on the board of directors of Children's
Hospital, the Museum of Science, and the Boys and Girls Clubs of
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Williams enjoyed skiing, trout and salmon fishing, and
hunting game birds. He was the former president of The Country Club
in Brookline.
</P>
<P>
   As a senior fellow at Dartmouth, he wrote ``Mr. Secretary,'' a
novel about President Abraham Lincoln's secretary of war, that was
published in 1940. He also wrote a bicentennial history of the Bank
of Boston, which was published in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   In a column published in the Globe on Jan. 15, 1984, David Warsh
wrote that Mr. Williams's authorized history of the bank was ``a
fine research job on the way the Massachusetts Bank evolved into
the First National Bank of Boston and then into the Bank of Boston,
collecting old minutes and tracking the dividend over 200 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The columnist predicted the book would do well, ``for it affords
a splendid glimpse inside the world of an affable WASP living in a
realm that many people thought died with John P. Marquand.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Williams leaves his wife, Jessie Ames (Marshall); three
daughters, Jay Williams Howland of Jamaica Plain, Toby Williams
Woll of Wayland, and Susan Ames Williams of Portland, Maine; a
sister, Ann Williams Wardwell of Searsmont, Maine; and four
grandchildren.

RETURNING CHECHEN REFUGEES FACE LOOTING, SHOOTINGS IN TOWNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SLEPTSOVSKAYA, Russia _ With the battle between government
troops and separatist rebels still raging in Chechnya's capital,
Russian authorities are telling tens of thousands of refugees to
return to what is left of their homes in the embattled republic.
</P>
<P>
   But for many refugees at crowded tent camps on Chechnya's
windswept western frontier, the order to return is not just a
sentence to harsh winter conditions in war-wrecked towns with
little shelter, little aid, and no way to make a living.
</P>
<P>
   Moving back will put them face to face with what they fear most
_ Russian paramilitary troops who, according to numerous accounts
by refugees and human rights workers, run roughshod over the
villages they are supposed to police, routinely looting homes and
shooting anyone who tries to resist them. Even as authorities
pressure the villagers to return, Russian military officers refuse
to offer guarantees that they and their homes will be spared
further violence.
</P>
<P>
   Although Moscow says its operation in Chechnya is aimed at
restoring law, order, and normal life to the region, Chechens
describe a vengeful occupying army whose soldiers often seem intent
on punishing everyone, whether or not they are rebel fighters.
</P>
<P>
   While Russian commanders predict the imminent capture of the
capital Grozny and a quick end to the war in Chechnya after that,
refugees fear the partisan fighting will continue around their
towns indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Malika Abdulkhalimova knows what that means. The mother of six
thought life would get better for her family in the Chechen town of
Sernovodsk after the Russians drove rebel fighters out in November
and conducted several sweeps to make sure there were none hiding
among the civilian population. But night after night,
Abdulkhalimova said, her family still hunkers in the basement while
the troops fire on their ruined town.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next they'll say, `Sorry, some of the guys got drunk,' or,
`We had a holiday yesterday', or `We thought we saw rebels,' ''
Abdulkhalimova said in Sleptsovskaya, a border town inside the
Russian region of Ingushetia that is temporary home to most of the
250,000 civilians who have fled Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``I truly worry what will happen on New Year's,'' she said, as a
truck carrying Russian paramilitary troops and Christmas trees
rumbled across the border into Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   But after a brief stay in Ingushetia, Abdulkhalimova is
returning home. Last week she saw an announcement, signed by five
Russian commanders, outside the tent camp where she had been
staying. It told residents of Sernovodsk and other towns declared
``safe'' to ``return to your homes,'' adding that ``humanitarian
aid will no longer be handed out to you.'' The next day she was
refused her ration of a loaf of bread.
</P>
<P>
   That was the day Russia tried to force thousands of refugees
back into Chechnya by coupling an engine to the railroad cars where
they were living and towing them toward Sernovodsk. The effort only
stopped when refugees blocked the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities here quietly rescinded the order to return after
protests from human rights organizations and the United Nations
High Commissioner on Refugees. Now, they say, Chechens can stay at
the camps until the end of Ramadan, the Muslim month of fasting
that ends in early January.
</P>
<P>
   Some people have gotten the message and are returning now.
Officials at the Sputnik camp, which had 9,000 refugees a month
ago, say 2,000 have left.
</P>
<P>
   But others are afraid to go. Laura Lolayeva, the head of a
family from Samashki, another devastated village whose residents
have been told to go back, said she had asked Russian officers at a
checkpoint near the town whether it was safe to return.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked what guarantees we have that we won't get shot at
later,'' Lolayeva said in her tent, where six adults and four
children share three beds. ``They say there is no guarantee.''
</P>
<P>
   Fueling the fears of people like Lolayeva are reports coming
from places like Alkhan-Yurt, where locals say Russian paramilitary
police went on a rampage earlier this month, looting and burning
houses and killing up to 41 civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``A significant number of homes in the village were burned by
the looting soldiers,'' said a report issued Tuesday by Human
Rights Watch, the New York-based human rights monitoring group,
which detailed the deaths of 17 civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees and human rights workers say looting is not isolated,
but occurs most often in villages, like Alkhan-Yurt, where rebel
fighters resisted the advance of Russian troops.
</P>
<P>
   After Russian television showed video footage that appeared to
implicate troops in the looting in Alkhan-Yurt, authorities
promised to investigate. But last week, the acting federal
prosecutor said no evidence of wrongdoing had been found.
</P>
<P>
   The commander of the forces in Alkhan-Yurt, Major General
Vladimir Shamanov, was one of four generals awarded the Hero of
Russia medal by President Boris Yeltsin in a Kremlin ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   In Grozny, pro-Russian Chechen forces said Tuesday they were
meeting unexpectedly fierce resistance, and a combination of foggy
weather and smoke rising from numerous fires _ which the Russians
accuse the rebels of setting _ made it harder for Russian air and
artillery to be effective. As the fighting raged, 10,000 to 40,000
civilians _ Russian citizens _ were believed to be still trapped in
cellars with little food.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's generals have been careful to characterize the
three-month offensive in Chechnya as a well-planned, careful, and
successful operation that has avoided the heavy losses forces
suffered in the last war. Even if the Russians capture Grozny, the
conflict is likely to drag on in the mountainous south, where heavy
fighting is underway along supply routes the rebels had been using
to ferry supplies into Chechnya from Georgia _ and civilian
refugees had been using to try to escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be ready for heavy resistance, and a drawn out
guerilla war,'' said Ingushetia's President Ruslan Aushev, a former
general and a hero of the Soviet campaign in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Aushev said he could imagine the current war going like the last
one, when Russian troops occupied much of Chechnya's territory by
early 1996, only to take heavy losses and ultimately lose Grozny in
August.

A FITTING END TO THE MOVIE CENTURY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: EMBARGOED until Thursday, Dec. 30. With FILM-STRAUSS-TOP-10) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What started as one of the most disappointing movie years of the
decade (was anyone really satisfied by that ``Star Wars'' prequel?)
came through, by the fall, as a surprisingly ambitious and
thoughtful farewell to the first 100-odd years of cinema. Films
from all over the world, and from Hollywood as well as the American
independent sector, rose to the occasion with serious agendas that
proved uniquely suitable for the 20th century's signature art
form. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Theme of the year
</P>
<P>
   It could not have been more evident in the idea that drove
practically all of 1999's better movies: the slippery nature of
identity. An especially apt subject for a media-saturated age when
image subverts truth at every opportunity, characters in this
year's movies faced the new millennium with a compelling lack of
certainty about themselves and an encouraging capacity for change.
</P>
<P>
   The approaches ranged from the relatively conventional _ midlife
crisis in ``American Beauty,'' ``Election'' and ``My Son the
Fanatic''; professional disillusionment in ``The Insider,''
``Topsy-Turvy'' and ``Bringing Out the Dead'' _ through an
impressive variety of mental mutations (``The Talented Mr.
Ripley,'' ``Man on the Moon,'' ``Magnolia,'' ``Girl, Interrupted,''
``All About My Mother,'' ``Fight Club,'' ``Felicia's Journey,''
``Boys Don't Cry,'' ``Bowfinger,'' ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' ``Blair
Witch Project,'' ``Summer of Sam,'' ``Analyze This'') to full-blown
reality crack-ups (``The Matrix,'' ``eXistenZ,'' ``Run Lola Run,''
``Open Your Eyes,'' ``The Sixth Sense,'' ``Being John Malkovich'').
Even ``Toy Story 2's'' computerized dolls dealt with existential
angst. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Performer of the year
</P>
<P>
   Who better to represent the year of mutable movie personalities
than Julianne Moore? Not only did the accomplished, fearless
actress appear in a staggering five features _ ``Magnolia,'' ``The
End of the Affair,'' ``Cookie's Fortune,'' ``An Ideal Husband'' and
``A Map of the World'' _ each role was totally different from the
others. And each woman she played went on a specific journey of
self-discovery, all of which Moore made completely credible. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Presence of the year
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the consciousness most deeply felt in the
premillennial cinema was, quite appropriately (if
uncharacteristically for sinful Hollywood), God's. People wrestled
with questions of faith in movies as diverse as Kevin Smith's
satirically profane ``Dogma'' to Norman Jewison's socially
conscious ``The Hurricane.'' The Big Guy, or at least those who
felt they represented Him, also manifested in ``The Green Mile,''
``Holy Smoke,'' ``End of the Affair,'' ``Magnolia,'' ``Bringing Out
the Dead,'' ``The Matrix'' and ``The Messenger.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Losses of the year
</P>
<P>
   The sudden uptick in spiritually concerned cinema seemed an
inadvertent homage to Robert Bresson, the great French minimalist
who captured transcendence on film as did no one else in such
true-to-the-bone masterpieces as ``Diary of a Country Priest,''
``Pickpocket'' and ``A Man Escaped.'' The year's other great loss,
of course, was Stanley Kubrick, whom many considered God-like in
his own way, ``Eyes Wide Shut'' notwithstanding. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Class of '99
</P>
<P>
   Even though Kubrick won't see what 2001 is really going to look
like, a bumper crop of new or new-to-America film talents make the
movies' near-future appear very bright indeed.
</P>
<P>
   This year's long list of impressive debuting directors includes
Sam Mendes (``American Beauty''), Spike Jonze (``Malkovich''), Dan
Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez (``Blair Witch''), Guy Ritchie (``Lock,
Stock and Two Smoking Barrels''), Kimberly Peirce (``Boys Don't
Cry''), Julie Taymor (``Titus''), Tony Bui (``Three Seasons''), Rob
Sitch (``The Castle''), Tom Tykwer (``Run Lola Run''), Brad Bird
(``Iron Giant'') and Udayan Prasad (``My Son the Fanatic'').
</P>
<P>
   Among welcome new screen faces were ``American Beauty's'' Wes
Bentley and Mena Suvari (who was also in that other ``American''
movie about the, um, baked goods), ``Tumbleweeds''' Janet McTeer
and Kimberly J. Brown, ``Blair Witch's'' Heather Donahue, Joshua
Leonard and Michael Williams, ``Boys Don't Cry's'' astounding
Hilary Swank (who made us completely forget that ``Karate Kid''
sequel), ``Sixth Sense's'' unforgettable Haley Joel Osment,
``Magnolia's'' Jeremy Blackman, ``The Hurricane's'' Vicellous Reon
Shannon, ``Rosetta's'' Emilie Dequenne and ``The War Zone's''
Freddie Cunliffe and Lara Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   And two astonishingly original and accomplished new
screenwriters, ``Beauty's'' Alan Ball and ``Malkovich's'' Charlie
Kaufman, emerged fully formed. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Not the usual cartoonishness
</P>
<P>
   If the expansion of feature-length animation was any kind of
signpost, there's the distinct possibility that drawn rather than
live characters are what we'll mostly be watching in the next
century. A chilling thought _ and ``Pokemon'' sequels ominously
loom _ but it will actually be something to celebrate if future
toons maintain the high standards of wit, graphic ingenuity and
storytelling chops established this year by ``Toy Story 2,''
``South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut,'' ``Princess Mononoke,''
``Tarzan'' and ``Iron Giant.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the words of a beloved 20th-century superstar,
Th-th-that's all, folks. &QL;

REELING IN THE MOVIE YEAR

<P>
   What to make of a year where, with dozens of teen love stories,
the best make-out scene involved an adolescent boy and a warm apple
pie?
</P>
<P>
   Well, you can read it any number of ways. Crazy, corrupting,
vomit-inducing (``The Blair Witch Project''), vomit-producing
(enough with the scenes of people throwing up!), when it's all said
and done (and it pretty much is, thank God), 1999 was a righteous
year for movies, serving up an array of audacious, high-energy
hell-raisers that made it fun again to go to the theaters.

BOB STRAUSS' TOP 10 MOVIES FOR 1999
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: EMBARGOED until Thursday, Dec. 30. With
FILM-STRAUSS-BEST-OF-99) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   1. Magnolia: Paul Thomas Anderson's rich, sprawling Rorschach
blot of a movie draws from Robert Altman's multicharacter mosaics
and the unbridled emotionalism of John Cassavetes' films. But it's
also its own unique animal: a great, abstract symphony of feeling.
Far ahead of what most filmmakers are imagining, ``Magnolia'' is
demanding, uncompromising and upsetting in the way only a
pioneering masterpiece can be. All that and frogs, too.
</P>
<P>
   2. American Beauty: The year's other pretty poison flower.
Suburban complacency is an easy thing to make fun of, but director
Sam Mendes, writer Alan Ball, cinematographer Conrad Hall and the
crack cast headed by Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening made it fresh
and scintillating with their wicked glee, underlying compassion and
expert craftsmanship. Dysfunction aestheticized to a high order.
</P>
<P>
   3. Being John Malkovich: Poker-faced surrealism marks this
inventive farce about identity confusion in the era of celebrity
worship. The concepts are audacious, the treatment loonily
matter-of-fact and the performances hilarious _ especially
Malkovich's as a supporting player in his own life.
</P>
<P>
   4. All About My Mother: Pedro Almodovar's best film, which is
really saying something. Spanish women on the verge support one
another by sharing their pain and trading off roles. Rarely has
there been so heartfelt and clever a tribute to femininity and
acting, or a movie that so astutely acknowledges the integral
connection between the two.
</P>
<P>
   5. Three Kings: The movie the Persian Gulf War deserves.
Clueless American freebooters head into beaten Iraq to grab a
fortune, only to discover that the war they won so easily was a lot
more complicated than they'd thought _ and is still raging.
Relentlessly exposes the muddled morality of our clean,
``costless'' victory.
</P>
<P>
   6. The Dreamlife of Angels: A new generation of French
filmmakers is returning the nation's cinema to its gloried
tradition of socially precise, perceptively detailed character
studies. Erick Zonca created the best of the best with this
absorbing tale of two young women from the barely working class,
what they share due to circumstances and how their natures drives
them in startlingly different directions. One of the most honest
films ever about reaching true adulthood after you thought you'd
grown up.
</P>
<P>
   7. The Straight Story: David Lynch's sweet, simple, reality-
based fable isn't exactly the artistic 180 some people think; the
often- transgressive director's G-rated marvel boasts all of his
trademark obsession with strange behavior and rich, unexpected
visual textures. As an old man driving his lawn mower across Iowa
to visit his estranged brother, Richard Farnsworth evokes all the
wisdom and regrets of a life examined at the last possible moment,
and in the process shows us how there is no such thing as a banal
human being.
</P>
<P>
   8. The Matrix: Hardware cinema blasted several parsecs into the
future with this endlessly ingenious sci-fi psych-out. Time, space
and reality were bent, spindled and reimagined _ along with the
technology to visualize filmed fantasy _ in this intense mixture of
martial arts, dystopian paranoia and artillery abuse. Selling Keanu
Reeves as mankind's savior was quite an accomplishment, too.
</P>
<P>
   9. Beyond the Clouds/Lovers on the Bridge: Busted. I'm cheating
here and happy to do it. The only things these films by
octogenarian Italian master Michelangelo Antonioni and delirious
young Frenchman Leos Carax have in common are exquisite visual
plans, unique insights into human hearts and the fact that they
were both made years ago but just released stateside in '99. And,
oh yeah, they brought more concentrated artistry to the screen than
the vast majority of films made this decade.
</P>
<P>
   10. The Blair Witch Project: Deceptively cruddy, this was
actually the best movie ever about people having a nervous
breakdown together in the woods. It also introduced a whole
generation to the concept of implied, rather than explicit, screen
terror. But none of that explains why this micro-budgeted,
Internet-promoted, shakily shot cult item became the most
profitable blockbuster of all time. Call it the real harbinger of
the new millennium's cinema, with all the opportunities for
unfettered creativity and careless exploitation that promises to
bear.

   INDIA-HIJACK (New Delhi, India) _ As more than 150 hostages
faced a fifth claustrophobic night of captivity on board an Indian
Airlines jet, the hijackers ratcheted up the pressure on the Indian
government by demanding that India pay them $200 million and
release 35 jailed militants, India's foreign minister Jaswant Singh
said tonight. By Celia W. Dugger.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-POLITICS (Jerusalem) _ Resolving a potentially
destabilizing political crisis, Prime Minister Ehud Barak on
Tuesday convinced the third-largest party in Israel to remain in
his coalition by offering increased financing and debt relief for
its state-subsidized religious schools. The party, Shas, an
ultra-Orthodox Sephardic party, dropped its plan to withdraw from
Barak's broad-based government when its brinkmanship worked. By

   BUSH-CAMPAIGN (Washington) _ State of the Campaign: For George
W. Bush, a typical day on the campaign trail used to involve a
$1,000-a-head fund-raiser or two, several skin-chafing marathons of
hand shaking and a few rote recitations of his maxim-laden stump
speech. But in New Hampshire over the next several weeks, Bush
plans to change all that. He'll be meeting with voters in a more
free-wheeling fashion with a question-and-answer format that will
look a lot like the town meetings that Sen. John McCain has been
holding across the state for the past two months. By Frank Bruni.

   NY-MAYOR-WELFARE (New York) _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announces
that he has fulfilled the pledge he made 18 months ago to end
welfare in New York City by 2000 by putting 48,000 people in jobs
or in programs that prepare them to work. But City Council members
immediately challenge the way the mayor is adding up the numbers.

</P>
<P>
   IRS-INNOCENT-SPOUSE (Undated) _ Last year Congress heard
testimony from four women who said that years after their husbands
left they discovered that they had been cheating on their taxes and
that the IRS expected them to pay huge bills, including interest.
In response, Congress made it easier for them not to pay such
taxes, as part of the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998. The
IRS expected no more than 3,000 new ``innocent spouse'' claims in
the years since then, but more than 45,000 applications, more than
90 percent of them filed by women, have already been logged, 15
times the anticipated number. By David Cay Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ORGAN-TRANSPLANTS (Undated) _ How much do patients' lives
have to do with who receives donated organs? At a time when human
organs, particularly livers, are in short supply, a look at the
national debate over the administration's plan to require that
donated organs go to the sickest patients first, rather than those
who live closest to the donors. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg.
</P>

   photo reefer: EUROPE-STORMS (Paris) _ Still struggling to pick
itself up after being pounded by a fierce storm on Sunday, France
was hit with another, equally fierce, storm overnight, killing 22
people and raising the death toll since Christmas to at least 66 in
France alone, officials said today. Storms have left more than 100
people dead in Western Europe in the past four days, but France has
been hit the hardest. By Suzanne Daley.

<P>
   David Lynch's G-rated tale of brotherly love is a haunting
requiem for a bygone America. Veteran actor Richard Farnsworth
delivers the performance of the year as a sweet, sad old-timer
taking an unlikely trip in order to unload a lifetime of regrets.
Along the way, he anoints those he meets with homespun wisdom and
decency, demonstrating the poetic beauty of an ordinary life lived
with absolute conviction. Spellbinding.
</P>
<P>
   2. American Beauty: The year's most remarkable box-office
triumph, given the perverse way director Sam Mendes and
screenwriter Alan Ball mix suburban angst with searing humor. A
remarkable ensemble cast _ headed by Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening,
Thora Birch, Mena Suvari, Chris Cooper and Wes Bentley _ explore
the isolation and dysfunction of modern America in a manner that
transcends satire and approaches, well, beauty.
</P>
<P>
   3. Being John Malkovich: Weird, wacky and, ultimately, quite
heartbreaking, this is a one-of-a-kind movie that will likely be
just as influential in its own contrary way as ``The Matrix'' and
``The Blair Witch Project'' will be in their respective genres. MTV
director Spike Jonze and reclusive writer Charlie Kaufman prove a
perfect match in their tag-team loopiness, skewering fame, identity
and alienation in the most imaginative manner.
</P>
<P>
   4. Toy Story 2: A sequel that manages the rare ``Godfather''
trick of improving upon the original. Clever and heartfelt, this
hyperkinetic foray into toy psychology bursts with so much smart
fun that it almost demands repeated viewings. (The folks at Disney
and Pixar certainly won't object.)
</P>
<P>
   5. Three Kings: The Gulf War receives the treatment it deserves
from fresh filmmaker David O. Russell. Crafting a rousing adventure
tale and infusing it with a bracing sense of moral outrage, Russell
shows us that war's insanity hasn't changed despite the presence of
CNN and smart bombs. Fearless filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   6. Magnolia: Everybody hurts and nobody seems to know this
better than filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson. First with ``Boogie
Nights'' and now with this fantastic follow-up, Anderson gives us
cascading symphonies of cinema _ demanding, deeply felt works that
brim with humanity. Anderson clearly loves making movies, and it's
impossible not to become caught up in his unbridled enthusiasm and
unparalleled artistry.
</P>
<P>
   7. The Talented Mr. Ripley: Proving that ``The English Patient''
was no fluke, filmmaker Anthony Minghella delivers another stylish
and seductive story. This time it's a thriller of the highest order
with Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow and the remarkable Jude Law
bringing Patricia Highsmith's chilling mystery classic to life.
Luminously shot and exquisitely inventive, ``Ripley'' incisively
probes desire, deceit and self-loathing. Beautiful to watch,
impossible to forget.
</P>
<P>
   8. The Buena Vista Social Club: This joyous documentary managed
to transcend the art-house limitations of its genre and become a
bona fide and richly deserved cultural phenomenon. Director Wim
Wenders captures the passion that music can bring to the lives of
those who create it and those who appreciate it. Lyrical in every
sense of the word.
</P>
<P>
   9. Run Lola Run: The year's best thrill ride, this 81-minute
speedball leaves its audience breathless with its ingenious mix of
special effects and camera speeds. In retelling the same story
three times, Tom Tykwer shows us the power that a moment can hold,
not to mention the strength of a flame-haired heroine sprinting to
save the man she loves.
</P>
<P>
   10. Boys Don't Cry: First-time filmmaker Kimberly Peirce and
``90210'' alum Hilary Swank take a story straight from the
headlines and give it a universal profundity. In playing Teena
Brandon, a young woman desperate to become a boy, Swank gives us a
character in search of the same sense of freedom that most
adolescents crave. Only Teena was different, and the devastating
price she paid for her distinctness makes this such a powerfully
tragic tale. &QL;

THE BEST _ AND WORST _ OF TV IN 1999
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: EMGBARGOED until Thursday, Dec. 30. Note italics below) 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you do a top-10 list of a year's worth of television, some
not-truly-great stuff can weasel its way in if you're not careful.
So instead, here's a top-5 list:
</P>
<P>
   1. ``The Sopranos'': If I were compiling a list of best (BEGIN
ITAL)anything(END ITAL) &UR; ! &LR;  this year _ movies, books, sports teams,
pasta dishes, Best-Of lists _ I'd probably put this near or at the
top of all of them; it was that good. David Chase's comedy-drama
essayed the life of Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini, as terrific as
the rest of the cast), a mobster suffering a midlife crisis worse
than most _ how many other people's mothers are trying to have them
killed? Virtually every episode was a masterpiece: In the pilot,
Tony wistfully waxed poetic about the loss of the geese that once
swam in his pool. The episode in which Tony took a break from
visiting colleges with his daughter to rub out an informant was
justly famous. A less-celebrated but no less powerful moment came
when Tony ultimately spared the life of a soccer coach who got on
his wrong side. Happily, new episodes begin in January.
</P>
<P>
   2. ``Animal Farm'' and ``Strange Justice'': One top telefilm
came from TNT, which adapted George Orwell loosely, yet made keen
points about power corrupting, thanks to a charming and/or
grotesque menagerie _ it was the darker side of ``Babe'' without
going stark-raving ``Pig in the City.'' The other was Showtime's
politically charged thriller examining the Clarence Thomas-Supreme
Court fiasco with both savvy insight and artfulness.
</P>
<P>
   3. ``Not for Ourselves Alone'' and ``New York: A Documentary
Film'': The Burns brothers did it again: Ken's documentary on the
suffragette movement _ particularly the women who spearheaded,
Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony _ managed to be both
authoritatively informative about a generally overlooked portion of
our nation's history and surprisingly moving. Ric's exhaustive,
10-hour epic (two more hours are due in early 2000) told you
everything you wanted to know about the Big Apple as well as some
stuff you didn't; Brian Keane added a haunting, evocative score.
</P>
<P>
   4. ``Freaks and Geeks'': It's the most honest depiction of high
school life on TV _ even if it does take place in the '80s and
seems mildly irrelevant to some of today's more media-savvy kids _
with smart scripts and actors who look as if they were born into
their roles. It's hilarious one week, moving the next and both the
week after that. Its ratings are hurting, but it's getting a second
chance in 2000 when it moves to Mondays on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   5. ``The League of Gentlemen'': Consigned to little-seen BBC
America, this British farce began typically enough, examining life
in a small, remote British hamlet, but got progressively more
perverse and weird and hilarious. Just one example _ a fiercely
proud, swinish couple running a shop catering only to ``local''
people and their increasingly demented campaign against
construction of a freeway that would roll through town. &QL; 
_____
</P>
<P>
   Now, if you do a bottom-10 list about that same TV year, you're
probably correctly accused of gratuitous nastiness. So in the
charitable spirit of the holidays, here's a bottom-five list:
</P>
<P>
   5. International women of mystery with large breasts: Shows like
``Amazon,'' ``D.R.E.A.M. Team,'' ``VIP,'' ``Sir Arthur Conan
Doyle's The Lost World,'' etc. are for guys who never made that
last big stride out of puberty.
</P>
<P>
   4. ``Wasteland'': ``Dawson's Creek'' reflected creator Kevin
Williamson before he went Hollywood. ``Wasteland'' reflected him
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   3. Italian-American anti-defamation leagues complaining about
``The Sopranos'': Did I miss the show's title card, ``This show
purports to be representative of all Italian-Americans''?
</P>
<P>
   2. Relentless coverage of John F. Kennedy Jr.'s death: ``Here's
the premature, non-obit obit about his fairy-tale life. We now cut
to the largely irrelevant press conference with the plane's
manufacturer _ for the third time. Time now for yet more conjecture
on the Kennedy curse, accompanied by strictly gratuitous footage of
Chappaquiddick. We have an interview with a guy who met him once at
a party and thought he was pretty down-to-earth for a Kennedy.
Excuse us, time for some breaking news _ there are no new
developments. Did we mention the fairy-tale life? Here's some
exclusive speculation on what the retrieved suitcase may look like.
Now, someone who worked in the same building as his wife will offer
up a pathetically failed attempt to describe her personality.
Remember, this is an American icon we're talking about, not just
some fellow who enjoyed luck of the draw at birth and edited a
mediocre magazine, meaning our wall-to-wall coverage is completely
justified. He truly had a fairy-tale life.'' Had Martha Quinn and
Laurie Hibberd from CBS' ``The Early Show'' been on the case, this
would have ranked No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Game-show mania: Let's face it, this is just wrestling for the
genteel lowbrow _ no bloodletting, less bellowing, fewer fashion
missteps. These shows aren't as crass as Jerry Springer or Sally
Jessy Raphael _ though Regis Philbin and Chuck Woolery pretty much
define unctuous _ and participants are more openly paid to squirm
for our amusement. But really, are we riveted to our tubes to find
out the answer to questions like, ``Which fashionable dot is named
after a dance _ the `hora' or the `polka'? What have we as a people
(BEGIN ITAL)become(END ITAL)?

`THE SURVIVOR': FINDING REALITY IN THE PAST OF A HOLOCAUST
CELEBRITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Switzerland, Poland, Israel, Germany)  (Eds.: Broadcast notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(DW) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   For a brief time Binjamin Wilkomirski was a celebrity: a
Holocaust celebrity. His book, ``Fragments,'' presented as drawn in
part from his memories as a 3- or 4-year-old, moved readers in a
dozen countries with its accounts of the horror of Nazi
concentration camps. ``The Survivor,'' on Wednesday night's
``Investigative Reports,'' tells his strange story through
interviews with the man himself, faithful friends and doubting
critics.
</P>
<P>
   Writing as an adult in Switzerland, Wilkomirski told of being
born to Jewish parents in Riga around 1939. When the Nazis invaded,
the German occupiers and Latvian fascists murdered thousands of
Jews, and the boy's earliest memories were of flight from the
killers. Separated from his family, he wound up in a notorious
Polish death camp. He wrote: ``I didn't know what it was, the place
with long wooden houses and barbed wire. I had almost nothing to
eat there. And that was Majdanek.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 6 or 7, he wrote, he was moved to an orphanage in Poland
and then, by a stroke of luck, to Switzerland. There he was given a
false identity, Bruno Grosjean, and adopted by a wealthy doctor and
his wife whose surname was Doessekker. The details are murky and
much disputed, but as he grew, he became fascinated with books on
the Holocaust. When his adoptive parents died, he collected an
inheritance and wrote his own book. His supposed memories, which
included experiments on him by Nazi doctors at Auschwitz, were
harrowing, and his book won admirers for its literary quality. He
became a star among concentration camp survivors. At least one
woman said she remembered him from the camps: ``He's my Binji,
that's all I know.''
</P>
<P>
   But a nemesis in the person of a Daniel Ganzfried, an
Israeli-born writer living in Zurich, was on his trail. Ganzfried,
whose father had been at Auschwitz, said the memories of the
so-called Wilkomirski rang false: ``I knew that the guy was a
fake.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends came to Wilkomirski's support, but a BBC correspondent
makes the point that details of the Riga occupation and Majdanek
are easy to find and could have been used for ``Fragments.'' The
BBC reports, too, that as an adult the author made several trips to
Poland, perhaps gathering additional information, but there is no
record of him in the Krakow orphanage, where he supposedly was.
</P>
<P>
   Ganzfried tracked down the existence of a real Bruno Grosjean
born in Switzerland in 1941 who was identified not as a Jewish
refugee but as the man who would come to call himself Wilkomirski.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never left Switzerland,'' said an acquaintance of the
author's. ``He never was out of Switzerland as a child.'' Others
who said they knew the young man said they remembered him as a
privileged Swiss youth who was not Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkomirski, or Grosjean, has declined to submit to a DNA test
to match against that of a Swiss Grosjean who says the younger man
is his son. As for the woman who reported, ``He's my Binji,'' it
turns out she was born in Seattle, wasn't Jewish and was never in a
concentration camp. This year several publishers withdrew the
hard-cover edition of ``Fragments'' as a hoax.

THYROID NODULE REMOVED FROM TIPPER GORE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and p coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN AND DOLORES KONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tipper Gore, wife of Vice President Al Gore, underwent surgery
Tuesday to remove a nodule from her thyroid gland. The nodule will
be examined for malignancy, though doctors said these small growths
are rarely a sign of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore accompanied his wife to Johns Hopkins
University Medical Center in Baltimore and stayed overnight with
her. The 51-year-old Mrs. Gore is expected to be released
Wednesday, although it isn't clear whether the medical condition
will affect her husband's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   News of the operation came as a surprise to members of the vice
president's campaign team, who believed the Gores were spending the
week between Christmas and New Year's at their farm in Carthage,
Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Camille Johnston, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Gore, said the nodule
was discovered during an examination for chronic neck pain that is
aggravated by exercise. She said the surgery was recommended as a
precautionary measure, and that results of the biopsy should be
known in about a week.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnston said Gore ``does not have a thyroid disease. There
are no symptoms of thyroid problems. Her hormonal surveys are
perfectly normal.''
</P>
<P>
   The thyroid gland, located in the neck, produces hormones that
regulate metabolism. Nodules on the thyroid are common and only
rarely cancerous, said physicians who treat thyroid disorders.
</P>
<P>
   One study found that four percent of people over 40 have thyroid
nodules, said Dr. Gary Cushing, head of the department of
endocrinology at Lahey Clinic in Burlington, Mass. About five
percent of people with nodules have thyroid cancer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nodules become more common with age, and about 50 percent of
Americans age 65 and older have them, according to Dr. Gilbert
Daniels, co-director of Thyroid Associates at Massachusetts General
Hospital and an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical
School.
</P>
<P>
   But the nodules are sometimes so small, that only 10 percent of
those 50 percent of older Americans with them ever have them
discovered, Daniels said.
</P>
<P>
   Once a nodule is found, usually during the course of a routine
physical, a so-called fine needle aspiration is typically done, to
take some tissue out of the lump for microscopic examination.
</P>
<P>
   Negative biopsy results are usually 98 to 99 percent accurate.
In that case, if the lump is small and doesn't bother the patient,
it does not have to be removed and may be treated with medication,
according to thyroid specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Only with suspicious or positive results are the nodules usually
removed, according to specialists.
</P>
<P>
   In Gore's case, the nodule was so small, it was not detectable
by casual touch and turned up only in a detailed couple of months
ago, according to Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   There was no biopsy done, but Gore's doctor watched the nodule
carefully and saw it had changed, although not drastically. ``It
was recommended as a precautionary measure,'' Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Udelsman of Johns Hopkins, a well-known endocrine
specialist, performed the surgery, Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
   Though the surgery occurred during a lull in what has been an
intense political season, the vice president is about to embark on
what may well be the most important 10 weeks of his political
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``As of right now, Al Gore plans to be back on the campaign
trail next week,'' Chris Lehane, the campaign press secretary, said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president is in a pitched battle to win the Iowa
caucuses Jan. 24 and the New Hampshire primary Feb. 1 against Bill
Bradley, the former New Jersey senator. The Democratic nomination
is likely to be determined by mid-March at the latest, after
primaries in New York, California and most of the Southern states.
</P>
<P>
   Since April, Mrs. Gore has been campaigning three to four days a
week for her husband. She has traveled extensively, delivered
speeches, and knocked on doors with campaign literature on the vice
president's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Though both Gore and his wife are avid joggers and outdoor
enthusiasts, cancer has touched the vice president, according to
medical records released this month. The records showed that he is
in excellent health, but in 1997 had a common form of skin cancer
removed from his right shoulder. In May, doctors removed what could
be a precursor to skin cancer from his forehead.

`THE THIRD MIRACLE:' INVESTIGATING MIRACLES WITHOUT THE KITSCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes appear at end of review.) (DW) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN

<P>
   Movies that treat religious experience as something other than
an opportunity for flashy telekinetic mayhem are so unusual that
Agnieszka Holland's schematically ambiguous film ``The Third
Miracle'' occupies its own special niche among recent movies
addressing faith and a belief in the miraculous. This intelligent,
well-acted movie is not helped by the fact that its story in some
ways parallels that of ``Stigmata,'' the trashy supernatural
spookfest that flared briefly at the box office earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Since the days of ``The Exorcist,'' Hollywood kitsch has so
thoroughly conditioned us to equate the miraculous with flying
furniture and hissing, foulmouthed demons that while watching ``The
Third Miracle'' you are likely to find yourself anticipating
fireworks that never materialize. In doing without the usual
special effects, this sober, occasionally plodding film takes a
huge chance. In the end you are left with the somewhat disquieting
realization that even the tackiest cinematic apparitions from the
spirit world convey a sense of awe that a more high-minded movie
like this one cannot produce.
</P>
<P>
   One of the problems of ``The Third Miracle,'' which was adapted
from a novel by Richard Vetere, an American identified by the film
company as a lapsed Catholic (Ms. Holland was brought up in
Communist Poland without religion by a Jewish father and a Catholic
mother), is that it wants to have it both ways. By showing a statue
of the Virgin Mary dripping with blood and portraying the sudden
miraculous recovery of a teen-age prostitute from a coma, it seems
to confirm the faith of believers. The tone of the rest of the
film, however, is deeply skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's contradictions are embodied in the figure of the
Rev. Frank Shore (Ed Harris), a Chicago priest suffering from a
crisis of faith, who works as a church-appointed ``spiritual
detective'' in charge of investigating the facts behind reported
miracles. Those inquiries can be profoundly disheartening. At the
beginning of the story he still hasn't recovered from an
investigation (to which the film flashes back) that earned him the
nasty nickname, the Miracle Killer.
</P>
<P>
   Called out of semiretirement by the local bishop, Shore is
assigned to look into the mystical phenomena associated with Helen
O'Regan (Barbara Sukowa), an immigrant woman who worked with the
poor until her recent death. Delving into Helen's life, he learns
that she was once married and had a daughter, Roxanna (Anne Heche).
When he meets Roxanna, who is not at all religious, an intense
attraction flares up between them. Far from being her mother's
champion, Roxanna is embittered by the fact that Helen largely
abandoned her to do good works.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, as red-blooded and earthy as an actor as we've got, is
an inspired choice for the role of Shore. As he discusses the
temptations of the flesh with Roxanna, you can almost feel his
quickening pulse as he is irresistibly drawn toward this smart,
beautiful woman from a similar background who seems so absolutely
right for him. Harris' screen presence is so robust and sensually
confident that it seems impossible such a man would take a vow of
celibacy. As diligently as he portrays his character's internal tug
of war, he is much better at conveying physical desire than
spiritual faith. Ms. Heche, as usual, makes the most of her
relatively small role, infusing it with a fierce, darting
intelligence and sly sensuality.
</P>
<P>
   As the debate over Helen's eventual canonization intensifies,
Shore, who argues in her behalf, goes up against Archbishop Werner
(Armin Mueller-Stahl), an imperious European cleric, and the movie
becomes bogged down in fussy theological arguments and an
investigation into Helen's childhood in Slovakia during World War
II. Even given its rich, finely shaded performances and
intellectual subtleties, ``The Third Miracle'' ends up feeling more
like an exercise, a carefully outlined set of variations on a
challenging theme, than a movie that had to be made.

   MAPUTO, Mozambique _ Push through the black iron gate, slip into
the tiny garden and there, amid crab grass, wild flowers and snake
plants, lies the detritus of this country's savage civil war. Only
now rusting AK-47s have been fashioned into a baby's cradle. Empty
machine guns curve into a globe, frozen on its axis. A rifle's
snout becomes the spinal cord of a half-made human being. The aging
weapons in this open-air studio, disabled now, were the ones that
killed and maimed during the 16-year-war that raged until 1992 and
took more than a million lives.
</P>
<P>
   The sculptor Fiel dos Santos runs his fingers over the silent
rifles and deactivated grenades and remembers the machine gun
blasts that shook his neighborhood and his childhood. But then he
pulls on his goggles and fires his welding machine, and the guns
buckle, change, transform.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times when I start thinking, `This killed, this
killed, this killed,' and then the weapons are difficult to
touch,'' said dos Santos, 27. ``But by creating this art, I'm
destroying these weapons,'' he added. ``I'm creating something new,
something that will make people think differently of the war.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven years after the fighting ended, young artists here in the
capital are turning weapons of destruction into sculpture that
celebrates everyday life in Mozambique's postwar society. Using
machine guns, rocket launchers and land mines given up by former
combatants, the artists are creating whimsical images and
transforming the deadly instruments that devastated their country.
</P>
<P>
   The arms-into-arts project began two years ago when the
Christian Council of Mozambique was deciding what to do with the
thousands of weapons it was collecting from former soldiers and
rebels, and approached the members of Nucleo de Arte, a well known
artists' studio, workshop and meeting place here.
</P>
<P>
   The artists were young men who grew up listening to the daily
war bulletins on their radios. They heard the gunfire ringing
outside their windows. They lost relatives to kidnappings and
killings. And they often went hungry because the food shortages
meant there was never enough rice or flour or meat.
</P>
<P>
   The council, which has so far collected 72,000 weapons from
former combatants, sees the ongoing project as a way to help
Mozambicans come to terms with the years of violence and to show
the world the progress since the war's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to forget about the war,'' said Christian Brun,
the art project adviser for the council. ``People have to remember
what it was and see how it can be transformed, to give people hope
and to confirm the new phase of peace and rebuilding.''
</P>
<P>
   The sculptures are currently on display in a new online
exhibition (www.africaserver.nl/nucleo/eng/index.html), and the
artists say the show is yet another symbol of Mozambique's
remarkable recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The building boom and the surge in foreign investment that have
made this country one of Africa's success stories in recent years
have also been accompanied by the stirrings of an artistic revival.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 young artists reopened the Nucleo de Arte, which was
closed during the civil war. In 1997 the Durban Art Gallery in
South Africa presented 32 works by Nucleo artists, the first large
exhibition of Mozambican art to be displayed in that country. Now
the weapon sculptures are being exhibited across Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Mozambique is still one of the poorest countries in the world,
and for most people an artist's life is still an unimaginable
luxury. But a combination of increasing foreign and government
support coupled with a general improvement in the standard of
living here has given young artists a sense of optimism, a change
that is reflected in their work.
</P>
<P>
   In the online exhibition, for instance, there is a sprightly
bird with a bayonet for a beak. A young mother with a rifle handle
for a skirt. A dancer who leaps on machine-gun-barrel legs.
</P>
<P>
   Goncalo Armando Mabunda, who once created a motorcyclist covered
in land mines, depicting a man who does not know he is about to
explode, is now working on a saxophone player with a rocket
launcher for a horn. The piece was inspired, he said, by a musician
friend who plays at a crowded club on Friday nights.
</P>
<P>
   During the war young people had few places to dance and listen
to music, Mabunda said. But today the jazz clubs are packed with
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad piece was because there was still this sense of war,''
said Mabunda, 24, of the motorcycle sculpture. ``But as time goes
by, I feel a new spirit. And the work changes as those feelings
change.''
</P>
<P>
   The weapons arrive in the studio here in wooden boxes, already
disabled and disarmed. The artists pick through the rusting bits
and pieces, envisioning a leg in a machine gun barrel, some hair in
a bunch of bandoliers.
</P>
<P>
   They are a varied lot who work in oils, wood, soapstone and
papier-mache. But not one was untouched by the back-and-forth
fighting between Frelimo, the dominant party in the current
government, and Renamo, the rebel movement that opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   Mabunda's favorite cousin, Gabriel, a government soldier, was
killed when his truck rolled over a land mine. Dos Santos' brother,
Manuel, was kidnapped by the rebels and forced to fight against the
government for six years.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Of Mozambique's roughly 15 million people at the time, it is
estimated that up to one million died, 1.5 million fled to refugee
camps in neighboring countries and perhaps 3 million more were
driven from their villages into overcrowded towns and cities.
</P>
<P>
   During the war many of the young artists had to scrounge for
paint and paper, and some used charcoal from cooking fires to
scribble on the streets and walls. They did not have opportunities
to expose their works because everyone was absorbed by the war,
said Joao Paulo Queha, 25, who has used the guns to create a
sculpture of his mother gathering firewood.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have more room in their lives to think about art now,''
Queha said. ``You can see even though they have no possibilities of
acquiring art, they have the feeling for art, the appreciation of
art.''
</P>
<P>
   Life is not easy, of course. The artists make little money, and
many rely on friends and family to get by. But here in the art
studio the artists revel in their newfound freedom.
</P>
<P>
   And on hot afternoons the guitars are strummed and harmonicas
whine as the young men sing and work, free from the anxieties of a
country at war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love music, but I have a terrible voice,'' Mabunda said as
he displayed his unfinished sculpture of the saxophone player.
``This is my way of singing, of making music.''

 `HIGHWAY' and `PARADISE': IT'S SHOW TIME, IN AN EXOTIC NO MAN'S(Eds: Production notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even a lifetime circusgoer is unlikely to have come across a
troupe as remarkable as the Tadjibajev family circus. Not because
one of the acts requires the eldest of the family's six children to
grip a red kerchief with his teeth and lift an attached 70-pound
weight to chest level before his father smites it repeatedly with a
sledge hammer. Or because that feat is followed by lying on a bed
of glass, using his forearms to support a metal plate over his
upper body while his father drops that selfsame weight on him.
</P>
<P>
   No, the remarkable things about the Tadjibajev family circus are
the way it lives, aboard a crowded, faded, rust-scabbed,
hand-cranked minibus, and the route it plies, a desolate stretch of
more than a thousand miles of road. Both are brought to vivid life
in ``Highway,'' a splendid documentary that is one of two
mesmerizing films by the Russian filmmaker Sergei Dvortsevoy.
</P>
<P>
   Each is a testament to the magical power of film to transport
the onlooker into other lives and distant lands, to kindle
contemplation, offer perspective and excite with the poetic beauty
of exotic images.
</P>
<P>
   Like its companion piece, ``Paradise,'' the 57-minute
``Highway'' immerses the onlooker in both life and landscape.
Besides the crowded bus of wailing babies, bickering boys,
exhausted mother, devout Muslim father, there are the miles and
miles of dusty, uneven road; parched Kazakh land; scarce, sere
vegetation; and an occasional settlement or truck stop where the
rolling beat of a drum summons an audience that at best seems to be
numbered in the 10's.
</P>
<P>
   After the performance, which includes the smallest boy, 3, and
the smallest girl, 2, walking on broken glass, the children pass
among the onlookers, seeking contributions. ``If you're broke,''
goes a translated comment by one of the performers, ``watch free.''
</P>
<P>
   At a roadside stop a snake slithers into some rocks. A young
eagle, fierce looking and huge but unable to fly, is captured by
the boys and becomes part of the family. In a meal beside the road,
one of the children wipes a plate clean with his fingers. As the
babies fret aboard the bus, their exhausted mother cries: ``Why do
you cry all the time? I'll kill all of you.'' But at night, she
sings a lullaby to her sleeping brood as the eagle keeps watch.
</P>
<P>
   The strength of Dvortsevoy's filmmaking is to make the viewer
want to know more about this family, to know their history and to
hear their thoughts. But his style is revelation through
watchfulness and not through interview.
</P>
<P>
   In the 25-minute ``Paradise,'' a title susceptible to literal
and ironic interpretation, Dvortsevoy descends on a nomadic
shepherd and his family on a steppe before a mountain backdrop in
Kazakhstan. In a succession of found moments, the filmmaker makes
the most of a curious cow that sticks her head in a milk can and
can't get it out, a young man who has had enough of isolation, a
woman baking bread and washing her hair, a pink-cheeked baby boy
making the messy most of his bowl of sour cream before falling
asleep, and a penknife operation on a camel before the family packs
up and moves on.
</P>
<P>
   Dvortsevoy is a nomad, too, and one can only hope that he will
return soon with more trophies of his travels.
</P>
<P>

   LOS ANGELES _ ``Best and Worst of Year'' lists are one of life's
necessary irritants, like flossing your teeth and listening to
presidential debates. Hoping to vary the formula slightly, here's
my list of 1999's ``10 Most Significant Happenings In L.A.
Theater,'' in no particular order.
</P>
<P>
   1. Not so long ago, the Pasadena Playhouse was a beloved but
creatively atrophied Spanish Revival landmark in search of an
artistic vision. Now, under energetic third-year artistic director
Sheldon Epps, it's a savvier, splashier institution, fresh off the
box-office smash ``Play On!'' (Epps' Jazz Age updating of
Shakespeare's ``Twelfth Night'') and a sterling revival of the Moss
Hart chestnut ``Light Up the Sky.'' Epps also has provided a
platform for new work and has formed an artistic alliance/exchange
with the Theater of Vienna. It's a tricky agenda, but so far Epps
seems to be keeping a diverse constituency happy while putting a
new sheen on an 82-year-old gem.
</P>
<P>
   2. Practical concerns (no-show-ers, not enough seats) as well as
creative opportunities led A Noise Within, the quietly accomplished
8-year-old classical repertory group, to relocate from downtown
Glendale and become resident company at California State
University, Los Angeles. With a loyal subscriber following and a
bigger, better-equipped venue at its disposal, A Noise Within
stands ready to expand the local demographic base for timeless
plays and extend its artistic reach as a major regional company.
</P>
<P>
   3. You'd have thought they were giving away free Oscars by the
number of film and TV stars on L.A. stages last season. A partial
list of marquee talent eager to reconnect with their theater roots
would include Al Pacino, Donald Sutherland, Calista Flockhart, Paul
Rudd, Annette Bening, Molly Ringwald, Alan Alda, Alfred Molina,
Kelsey Grammer and David Hyde Pierce. The upside: Angelenos got to
see top Hollywood performers up close and personal, as New Yorkers
and Londoners do regularly. The downside: Ticket shortages and the
prospect of too much celebrity-driven theater in a town already
besotted with big names.
</P>
<P>
   4. The Reprise! series of staged concert musicals took a major
step forward in its third year with its laudable productions of the
murderously difficult ``Sweeney Todd,'' starring Kelsey Grammer, at
the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion and ``The Boys From Syracuse'' at
UCLA's Freud Playhouse. Both shows received national media
attention and signaled producer Marcia Seligson's intent to keep
raising the series' already high standards.
</P>
<P>
   5. The Geffen Playhouse also reached a creative milestone with
last spring's production of Donald Margulies' ``Collected
Stories.'' The brilliant performance by Linda Lavin (of TV's
``Alice'') as a college professor eclipsed by her ambitious protege
was the main reason to see this funny, provocative two-character
spin on ``All About Eve.'' Samantha Mathis proved a formidable
co-star, helping to turn this production into the Geffen's first
Broadway-quality show, as well as a surprise hit.
</P>
<P>
   6. Although it was a long-running cult hit in New York, the
Platonically inspired, transsexual rock 'n' roll spoof ``Hedwig and
the Angry Inch,'' starring talented Michael Cerveris, never caught
on with L.A. audiences and is closing this month at a loss
reportedly in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Producers Joan
Stein and Susan Dietz deserve much credit for giving the offbeat
musical play a chance. But the absence of a major star in the lead
role and the fact that East Hollywood lacks the funky downtown
ambience of the East Village kept ``Hedwig'' from capturing L.A.'s
imagination, despite good reviews.
</P>
<P>
   7. Six years after being leveled by the Northridge Earthquake,
the former El Portal movie house, in the heart of the NoHo Arts
District, threw a November coming-out bash for its new incarnation
as the El Portal Center for the Arts. In league with its principal
tenant, 28-year-old Actors Alley theater company, the El Portal
hopes to become the Valley's first fully professional midsize
theater, with full seasons of plays at both its 382-seat Mainstage
Theatre and its 99-seat Circle Theatre, as well as offering
cabaret, performance classes, dance and other attractions. Sounds
promising, but the productions will have to be top-notch to
maintain the necessary patron support and advertising bucks both
inside and outside the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   8. On a related note, several of the El Portal's NoHo and Valley
neighbors last year opened new theaters (American Renegade) or took
on full seasons of plays (Theatre West, Falcon Theatre in Burbank).
More area theaters are planning moves to NoHo in the coming years,
shoring up the Valley's primary cultural enclave.
</P>
<P>
   9. After treading water in recent years, Laurie Anderson
reasserted her ability to pull new, idiosyncratic insights from
mainstream Americana with last fall's high-concept multimedia
odyssey, ``Songs and Stories From Moby Dick,'' at UCLA's Royce
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   10. Sir Peter Hall's Shakespearean double bill at the Ahmanson
last summer produced a split decision: a timely, emotionally
engaging ``Measure for Measure'' and a shrill, conventional ``A
Midsummer Night's Dream.'' In future, this trans-Atlantic joint
venture will need longer rehearsal times and more conceptual daring
if it's to become a can't-miss part of the summer cultural
calendar.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Facing heavy resistance from rebels in Chechnya, the
Russian military conceded Tuesday that the fighting there could
drag on for at least several more months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take at least two to three months to complete the
liquidation of scattered and, unfortunately, very numerous
terrorist bands,'' Col. Gen. Valery Manilov, a senior officer on
the Russian general staff, told reporters Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has expressed hope that Russia
could achieve a speedy victory in Chechnya. That would not only
limit Russian losses but would also hand Putin a military triumph
before this summer's presidential elections in which he is now the
leading candidate to succeed Boris Yeltsin. Much of Putin's
popularity reflects the success the military has enjoyed so far in
its 3-month-old campaign in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the Russian military embraces the official optimism,
it has begun to prepare the public for a war that may be longer and
messier than anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   The military's basic message now is that the capture of Grozny,
the Chechen capital, is a slow and methodical process. And even
after Grozny is subdued, the military says, it will still have to
do battle with thousands of rebels in mountain redoubts.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military estimated Tuesday that there are 7,000 to
8,000 rebels in the mountainous areas to the south _ about four
times the estimated number of militants in Grozny. Russian forces
have surrounded several mountain villages controlled by the rebels,
including Nozhai-Yurt, Zandak and Vedeno. But if the rebels retreat
further into the mountains they will be fighting on familiar
terrain that is far more defensible than the cities and towns of
Chechnya's lowlands.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging the difficulty of capturing Chechnya, the Russian
military said Tuesday that it was planning to maintain a sizable
force there indefinitely. Manilov said the Russian authorities are
planning to station a Russian army division, an Interior Ministry
brigade and a sizable contingent of border troops in Chechnya after
the war ends to maintain control of the republic and try to prevent
the rebels from building up their forces again.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the operation is completed unnecessary forces will be
withdrawn, but a full division will remain,'' Manilov said. ``A
full brigade of Interior Ministry troops will ensure the
maintenance of constitutional order on this part of Russian
territory. And border troops will seal the state border.''
</P>
<P>
   While the military challenges may be considerable, the immediate
focus at the Kremlin on Tuesday was on celebrating the gains
achieved so far. Yeltsin handed out medals to Russian commanders
and described the military campaign as picture-perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Gen. Viktor Kazantsev, the commander of Russian forces in
the North Caucasus; Lt. Gen. Gennadi Troshev, the commander of the
Eastern Group of forces in Chechnya; and Major Gen. Vladimir
Shamanov, the commander of the Western Group of forces there, were
made ``Heroes of Russia'' and awarded gold stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been little mistakes in the past that led to big
mistakes,'' Yeltsin said. ``There is nothing of the sort now. The
army is faultless this time following the orders of the president
and the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the situation in Grozny seemed to be more complex.
The Russians began their assault four days ago and have managed to
penetrate within two miles of the city center, advancing from the
Khankala region, the Severny Airport area and the Staropromyslovsky
district, much of which the Russians say they now control.
</P>
<P>
   They say that they are being more cautious and deliberate than
in the 1994-1996 war in Chechnya. This time when they encounter
resistance they pull back and use artillery and aircraft to pummel
their foes before advancing again.
</P>
<P>
   But the rebels are using mines, smoke screens from oil-filled
trenches and their knowledge of the city to slow the Russian
attack. Fog and rain have also interfered with Russian air strikes,
given the rebels a temporary respite from air attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels claim to have killed hundreds of Russian troops. But
Russian spokesman insisted that Tuesday's casualties were
exceedingly light: Four Russian soldiers and one Chechen
paramilitary allied with Moscow were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Soigu, Russia's minister for emergency situations, has
opened negotiations with the Chechens over the fate of the tens of
thousands of civilians trapped in Grozny, but they have yet to bear
fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Manilov said it was important not to force the pace of the
Grozny operation. The fall of Grozny he said, ``may come tomorrow
or the day after tomorrow, or it may take five, six or seven days
more. But it is still a matter of days, not weeks or months.''

CLAYTON MOORE, 85; PORTRAYED LONE RANGER ON EARLY TV 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clayton Moore, whose portrayal of the The Lone Ranger defined
the moral code of the first TV generation in the 1950s, died
Tuesday of a heart attack at West Hills Hospital in Los Angeles. He
was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's passing, along with the recent deaths of Roy Rogers and
Gene Autry, and Rex Allen's demise last week, brings to a close an
era when the difference between good and evil was as plain as the
hat on your head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll wear the white hat the rest of my life,'' Moore said in a
1985 Los Angeles Times interview. ``The Lone Ranger is a great
character, a great American. Playing him made me a better person.''
</P>
<P>
   Some '50s TV actors couldn't wait to shed their TV personae.
George Reeves, who played the title role in the ``Superman'' series
saw himself as a serious performer and despised being stereotyped
as the Man of Steel. Ricky Nelson, who played a variation of
himself as the youngest son on ``Ozzie and Harriet,'' dropped the
``y'' from his name and wrote a hit song called ``Garden Party'' as
a plea to his fans to leave little Ricky behind. But not Moore. He
was, and will always be, The Lone Ranger.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949 no actor really wanted to try TV, especially at ABC, the
youngest of the three major networks. But Moore's career was stuck
in B movie quicksand and had been there since his screen debut in
the '30s. And, as a kid, he loved listening to Bruce Beamer's
portrayal on the original radio dramas. So he signed on. After
playing the role for the first season, Moore, realizing the show's
popularity had increased ABC's visibility, asked for a raise. ABC
balked and Moore walked. He was replaced by John Hart for a few
months before winning his case and returning. Watching the Hart
episodes made it clear that without that rich, mellifluous voice,
The Lone Ranger was just another cowboy.
</P>
<P>
   Children in the 1950s sang the trademark theme from ``The
William Tell Overture,'' mailed in cereal box tops for the toy
silver bullets, and chanted the Ranger's cry of ``Hi-Yo, Silver!''
in their playtimes.
</P>
<P>
   What made The Lone Ranger special is that he never killed
anyone; he was sensitive to Indians in an age before they were
referred to as Native Americans and he was sincere.
</P>
<P>
   In the '60s, militant Native Americans adopted the term Tonto to
specify the Native American version of the African-American
designation, Uncle Tom. But The Lone Ranger, particularly in both
his feature-length films _ ``The Lone Ranger'' (1956) and ``The
Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold'' (1958) _ was light years
ahead of most western characters. Both films feature evil settlers
trying to steal from the Indians and Mexicans of the time. Not, as
was the convention, the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's resiliance was put to the test in 1979 when the
producers of a feature-length re-make of ``The Lone Ranger,''
starring Klinton Spilsbury, won a court battle preventing Moore
from making appearances as The Lone Ranger and from wearing the
famous mask. Moore continued making personal appearances in
wraparound sunglasses, but it wasn't the same. He fought back. The
movie flopped when it was finally released in 1981 and, in 1984,
the court ruled that Moore could, once again, don the mask.
</P>
<P>
   It may be inappropriate to suggest, in an appreciation, that
Moore wasn't much of an actor. But he was an exceptional Lone
Ranger. Because, for him, it wasn't a role, it was a way of life.
And, while Moore never wrote any scripts, he did come up with what
he called The Lone Ranger Creed:
</P>
<P>
   Some excerpts:
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe:
</P>
<P>
   _ That to have a friend, a man must be one.
</P>
<P>
   _ That God put the firewood there, but every man must gather and
light it himself.
</P>
<P>
   _ That men should live by the rule of what is best for the
greatest number.
</P>
<P>
   _ That sooner or later, somewhere, somehow, we must settle with
the world and make payment for what we have taken.
</P>
<P>
   _ That all things change but truth, and that truth alone lives
on forever.''
</P>
<P>
   In his code, there is the sense of environmental awareness,
democratic ideals, anti-imperialist doctrine and Emersonian
self-reliance. A fine code in anyone's book.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children need heroes like the Lone Ranger,'' Moore told The
Associated Press in 1986. ``This is important because these kids
are young America. They are going to be running this country some
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore was born Sept. 14, 1914 _ some sources give an earlier
year _ in Chicago, son of a real estate developer.
</P>
<P>
   He was largely retired in recent years, living at his home in
Calabasas, near Los Angeles. Moore is survived by his wife,
Clarita, and his daughter, Dawn Moore Gerrity. He had been married
previously to actress Sally Allen, who died in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Those who grew up dreaming of silver bullets can shut their eyes
now and hear, off in the distance, ``Hi, Yo! Silver, away!''
Somewhere, rattling off the broadcast satellites circling the
planet, The Lone Ranger rides again.

 &HT;    McCain's grassroots support reaching U.S. netizens
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ John McCain's presidential campaign reported
Tuesday that it has received more than $1 million in contributions
online, including a surge of donations in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raising milestone is just one facet of McCain's
widening use of the Internet in his longshot campaign for the
Republican nomination, and part of the growing importance of
cyberspace in American politics.
</P>
<P>
   McCain still trails Democratic candidate Bill Bradley in the
quest for Internet contributions. Bradley has raised more than $1.3
million on line, and the average contribution is $140, said
campaign spokeswoman Sara Howard.
</P>
<P>
   The average online contribution to McCain is $100.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's increased use of the Internet has coincided with the
rise in popularity of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past few months, we've seen a consistent increase in
our poll numbers and a boom in our online fund-raising,'' said Herb
Allison, the campaign's finance chairman.
</P>
<P>
   McCain received just under $500,000 from May to September,
including money from the sales of posters, T-shirts and buttons.
Since October, McCain has netted more than $620,000. The average
daily income from all Internet contributions reached $10,000 in
December, a monthly high, the campaign said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's overall fund-raising for the year is expected to be
around $15 million, so the Internet contributions represent a small
fraction of his total receipts. Yet campaign officials say that it
is a relatively painless and inexpensive way to raise money.
</P>
<P>
   The ease of attracting support in this manner is especially
important to McCain, whose fund raising is dwarfed by the success
of Texas Gov. George W. Bush and the personal wealth of magazine
publisher Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has raised more than $60 million and Forbes has said he is
prepared to spend whatever it takes to be competitive with Bush.
Both men, like most of the presidential candidates, have web sites
that allow for Internet contributions.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush and Forbes have highlighted other aspects of their
sites. Bush's offers a running daily list of contributors to his
campaign. Forbes provides the most detailed policy proposals of all
the presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to raising money, McCain has effectively used banner
advertising on the Internet to help him get on the ballot in
Virginia and communicate with thousands of supporters in the blink
of an eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no faster means of communicating and no better
two-way resource,'' said Wes Gullett, McCain's deputy campaign
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Gullett related a first-hand example of the Internet's
effectiveness a few days before Christmas. The campaign called a
meeting of volunteers who would make telephone calls to voters in
the Tucson area.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were about 25 people and about half of them had come
from the Internet,'' Gullett said. ``They had never been involved
in a political campaign before.''
</P>
<P>
   To help get enough signatures to include McCain on the Virginia
primary ballot, the campaign advertised on about 1,500 web sites
and targeted the ads to users who are registered to vote in
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Gullett said two percent of the people who saw the McCain banner
ads clicked on them, a ``click-through'' rate far higher than the
industry average of .8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign also has taken note of a phenomenal increase in the
number of visits to its web site. The ``hits'' on
www.mccain2000.com have more than doubled from 4.5 million in
November to more than 9 million this month.

MOVIE INDUSTRY DVD PIRACY SUIT CASTS CHILL OVER INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY BOSTON GLOBE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An effort by the movie industry to prevent illegal copying of
digital video disks, or DVDs, could turn into a crucial battle over
the fundamental rights of Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the question of whether Web site operators can help
distribute a piece of software that can defeat the security system
built into millions of DVD discs, thus enabling people to make
illegal copies.
</P>
<P>
   DVD is one of the biggest success stories in consumer
electronics. The technology can store a full-length movie on a disk
the same size as a standard music CD. And the DVD produces image
and sound quality far superior to that of video tape. Just two
years after they were introduced, consumers have already purchased
about five million of the devices. Major Hollywood studios are
rushing to release DVD versions of popular movies.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the studios like DVD is because the system includes
special encryption technology which is supposed to make it
impossible to copy a DVD disk. But in November, computer hackers in
Norway unveiled a program called DeCSS which breaks the DVD
encryption system.
</P>
<P>
   Now the DVD Copy Control Association Inc., a DVD industry group,
is moving to prevent a wave of DVD piracy. The association filed
suit Monday in a California state court against dozens of Internet
sites, demanding that they stop distributing DeCSS.
</P>
<P>
   The association didn't just sue Web sites that feature DeCSS
software. It also demanded that dozens of Web pages remove links to
other sites where the software is available.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, many visitors to the popular technical Web site
Slashdot have posted messages which include links to DeCSS. The
lawsuit would require that Slashdot remove all such messages from
its site, arguing that merely posting links to the illegal software
is itself illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Information posted on Defendants' web sites establishes that
they are fully aware that, in posting or linking to the DeCSS
program, they are wrongfully appropriating proprietary trade
secrets.'' the association's complaint reads.
</P>
<P>
   The offices of the association are closed for the holidays, and
the group's attorney declined to speak with the Globe. But
reactions from others ranged from skepticism to outright hostility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gotta say, I wouldn't want to be them,'' said Jonathan
Zittrain, lecturer in Internet law at the Harvard Law School. For
one thing, Zittrain said that DeCSS may not be illegal in Norway,
where it was invented.
</P>
<P>
   That's certainly the view of one of the crackers, Frank
Stevenson, a programmer for a Norwegian game maker who helped
develop DeCSS as a hobby. ``This is what cryptographers do for
fun,'' Stevenson said. ``You get your hands on a new cryptosystem
and figure out if it's any good. I found out this one wasn't any
good.'' Stevenson said that in Norway, his actions are legal.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Zittrain said he doubted a judge would order the
operator of a Web site to stop linking to some other Web site. ``My
guess is that a judge is going to be pretty skeptical.''
</P>
<P>
   But earlier this month a federal judge in Utah issued a
temporary injunction that forced operators of a Web site to remove
links to pirated documents belonging to the Mormon church. The site
operators may appeal the injunction.
</P>
<P>
   Victory for the DVD industry could cause worries for a variety
of Internet services. For instance, Lycos Inc. of Waltham, Mass.
runs an index of music files on the Internet. Many of these files
are illegal copies of commercial recordings. A ruling in favor of
the DVD industry would raise the prospect that Lycos' music index
would either have to shut down, or be modified to ensure that only
legal recordings would be listed.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, angry visitors to Slashdot have discussed
holding a protest Wednesday at the Santa Clara County courthouse
where the suit has been filed. Other Slashdot users are urging
people to download DeCSS and to post it in as many places on the
Internet as possible, on the theory that it will be impossible to
shut all the sites down. And sites where the software is currently
available are receiving heavy traffic from people seeking to get a
copy for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``More people have downloaded the program from my server today
than in the last 30 days!'' wrote Slashdot user Andrew Thomas
McLaughlin, who is listed as a defendant in the suit. ``I suppose I
have the law firm to thank for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rob Malda, editor-in-chief at Slashdot, says he isn't worried
about the legal action against his site. Slashdot is now owned by
Andover.net Inc. of Acton, Mass., and Malda said he'll let the
company's attorneys worry about the matter.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that if the lawsuit is successful, there will be a
chilling effect on Internet free speech, because many people would
be afraid to link to someone else's Web site, which might contain
copyrighted material. ``That's the end of the First Amendment,''
Malda said.

GLENN WHIPP'S TOP 10 MOVIES FOR 1999
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Corrected version ADDS the No. 1 to first entry. Story is
EMBARGOED until Thursday, Dec. 30) 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   1. David Lynch's G-rated tale of brotherly love is a haunting
requiem for a bygone America. Veteran actor Richard Farnsworth
delivers the performance of the year as a sweet, sad old-timer
taking an unlikely trip in order to unload a lifetime of regrets.
Along the way, he anoints those he meets with homespun wisdom and
decency, demonstrating the poetic beauty of an ordinary life lived
with absolute conviction. Spellbinding.
</P>
<P>
   2. American Beauty: The year's most remarkable box-office
triumph, given the perverse way director Sam Mendes and
screenwriter Alan Ball mix suburban angst with searing humor. A
remarkable ensemble cast _ headed by Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening,
Thora Birch, Mena Suvari, Chris Cooper and Wes Bentley _ explore
the isolation and dysfunction of modern America in a manner that
transcends satire and approaches, well, beauty.
</P>
<P>
   3. Being John Malkovich: Weird, wacky and, ultimately, quite
heartbreaking, this is a one-of-a-kind movie that will likely be
just as influential in its own contrary way as ``The Matrix'' and
``The Blair Witch Project'' will be in their respective genres. MTV
director Spike Jonze and reclusive writer Charlie Kaufman prove a
perfect match in their tag-team loopiness, skewering fame, identity
and alienation in the most imaginative manner.
</P>
<P>
   4. Toy Story 2: A sequel that manages the rare ``Godfather''
trick of improving upon the original. Clever and heartfelt, this
hyperkinetic foray into toy psychology bursts with so much smart
fun that it almost demands repeated viewings. (The folks at Disney
and Pixar certainly won't object.)
</P>
<P>
   5. Three Kings: The Gulf War receives the treatment it deserves
from fresh filmmaker David O. Russell. Crafting a rousing adventure
tale and infusing it with a bracing sense of moral outrage, Russell
shows us that war's insanity hasn't changed despite the presence of
CNN and smart bombs. Fearless filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   6. Magnolia: Everybody hurts and nobody seems to know this
better than filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson. First with ``Boogie
Nights'' and now with this fantastic follow-up, Anderson gives us
cascading symphonies of cinema _ demanding, deeply felt works that
brim with humanity. Anderson clearly loves making movies, and it's
impossible not to become caught up in his unbridled enthusiasm and
unparalleled artistry.
</P>
<P>
   7. The Talented Mr. Ripley: Proving that ``The English Patient''
was no fluke, filmmaker Anthony Minghella delivers another stylish
and seductive story. This time it's a thriller of the highest order
with Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow and the remarkable Jude Law
bringing Patricia Highsmith's chilling mystery classic to life.
Luminously shot and exquisitely inventive, ``Ripley'' incisively
probes desire, deceit and self-loathing. Beautiful to watch,
impossible to forget.
</P>
<P>
   8. The Buena Vista Social Club: This joyous documentary managed
to transcend the art-house limitations of its genre and become a
bona fide and richly deserved cultural phenomenon. Director Wim
Wenders captures the passion that music can bring to the lives of
those who create it and those who appreciate it. Lyrical in every
sense of the word.
</P>
<P>
   9. Run Lola Run: The year's best thrill ride, this 81-minute
speedball leaves its audience breathless with its ingenious mix of
special effects and camera speeds. In retelling the same story
three times, Tom Tykwer shows us the power that a moment can hold,
not to mention the strength of a flame-haired heroine sprinting to
save the man she loves.
</P>
<P>
   10. Boys Don't Cry: First-time filmmaker Kimberly Peirce and
``90210'' alum Hilary Swank take a story straight from the
headlines and give it a universal profundity. In playing Teena
Brandon, a young woman desperate to become a boy, Swank gives us a
character in search of the same sense of freedom that most
adolescents crave. Only Teena was different, and the devastating
price she paid for her distinctness makes this such a powerfully
tragic tale. &QL;

CLAYTON MOORE, 85; PORTRAYED LONE RANGER ON EARLY TV 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Fixes spelling of Brace Beemer; a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clayton Moore, whose portrayal of the The Lone Ranger defined
the moral code of the first TV generation in the 1950s, died
Tuesday of a heart attack at West Hills Hospital in Los Angeles. He
was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's passing, along with the recent deaths of Roy Rogers and
Gene Autry, and Rex Allen's demise last week, brings to a close an
era when the difference between good and evil was as plain as the
hat on your head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll wear the white hat the rest of my life,'' Moore said in a
1985 Los Angeles Times interview. ``The Lone Ranger is a great
character, a great American. Playing him made me a better person.''
</P>
<P>
   Some '50s TV actors couldn't wait to shed their TV personae.
George Reeves, who played the title role in the ``Superman'' series
saw himself as a serious performer and despised being stereotyped
as the Man of Steel. Ricky Nelson, who played a variation of
himself as the youngest son on ``Ozzie and Harriet,'' dropped the
``y'' from his name and wrote a hit song called ``Garden Party'' as
a plea to his fans to leave little Ricky behind. But not Moore. He
was, and will always be, The Lone Ranger.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949 no actor really wanted to try TV, especially at ABC, the
youngest of the three major networks. But Moore's career was stuck
in B movie quicksand and had been there since his screen debut in
the '30s. And, as a kid, he loved listening to Brace Beemer's
portrayal on the original radio dramas. So he signed on. After
playing the role for the first season, Moore, realizing the show's
popularity had increased ABC's visibility, asked for a raise. ABC
balked and Moore walked. He was replaced by John Hart for a few
months before winning his case and returning. Watching the Hart
episodes made it clear that without that rich, mellifluous voice,
The Lone Ranger was just another cowboy.
</P>
<P>
   Children in the 1950s sang the trademark theme from ``The
William Tell Overture,'' mailed in cereal box tops for the toy
silver bullets, and chanted the Ranger's cry of ``Hi-Yo, Silver!''
in their playtimes.
</P>
<P>
   What made The Lone Ranger special is that he never killed
anyone; he was sensitive to Indians in an age before they were
referred to as Native Americans and he was sincere.
</P>
<P>
   In the '60s, militant Native Americans adopted the term Tonto to
specify the Native American version of the African-American
designation, Uncle Tom. But The Lone Ranger, particularly in both
his feature-length films _ ``The Lone Ranger'' (1956) and ``The
Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold'' (1958) _ was light years
ahead of most western characters. Both films feature evil settlers
trying to steal from the Indians and Mexicans of the time. Not, as
was the convention, the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's resiliance was put to the test in 1979 when the
producers of a feature-length re-make of ``The Lone Ranger,''
starring Klinton Spilsbury, won a court battle preventing Moore
from making appearances as The Lone Ranger and from wearing the
famous mask. Moore continued making personal appearances in
wraparound sunglasses, but it wasn't the same. He fought back. The
movie flopped when it was finally released in 1981 and, in 1984,
the court ruled that Moore could, once again, don the mask.
</P>
<P>
   It may be inappropriate to suggest, in an appreciation, that
Moore wasn't much of an actor. But he was an exceptional Lone
Ranger. Because, for him, it wasn't a role, it was a way of life.
And, while Moore never wrote any scripts, he did come up with what
he called The Lone Ranger Creed:
</P>
<P>
   Some excerpts:
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe:
</P>
<P>
   _ That to have a friend, a man must be one.
</P>
<P>
   _ That God put the firewood there, but every man must gather and
light it himself.
</P>
<P>
   _ That men should live by the rule of what is best for the
greatest number.
</P>
<P>
   _ That sooner or later, somewhere, somehow, we must settle with
the world and make payment for what we have taken.
</P>
<P>
   _ That all things change but truth, and that truth alone lives
on forever.''
</P>
<P>
   In his code, there is the sense of environmental awareness,
democratic ideals, anti-imperialist doctrine and Emersonian
self-reliance. A fine code in anyone's book.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children need heroes like the Lone Ranger,'' Moore told The
Associated Press in 1986. ``This is important because these kids
are young America. They are going to be running this country some
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore was born Sept. 14, 1914 _ some sources give an earlier
year _ in Chicago, son of a real estate developer.
</P>
<P>
   He was largely retired in recent years, living at his home in
Calabasas, near Los Angeles. Moore is survived by his wife,
Clarita, and his daughter, Dawn Moore Gerrity. He had been married
previously to actress Sally Allen, who died in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Those who grew up dreaming of silver bullets can shut their eyes
now and hear, off in the distance, ``Hi, Yo! Silver, away!''
Somewhere, rattling off the broadcast satellites circling the
planet, The Lone Ranger rides again.

MOVIE INDUSTRY DVD PIRACY SUIT CASTS CHILL OVER INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY BOSTON GLOBE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An effort by the movie industry to prevent illegal copying of
digital video disks, or DVDs, could turn into a crucial battle over
the fundamental rights of Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the question of whether Web site operators can help
distribute a piece of software that can defeat the security system
built into millions of DVD discs, thus enabling people to make
illegal copies.
</P>
<P>
   DVD is one of the biggest success stories in consumer
electronics. The technology can store a full-length movie on a disk
the same size as a standard music CD. And the DVD produces image
and sound quality far superior to that of video tape. Just two
years after they were introduced, consumers have already purchased
about five million of the devices. Major Hollywood studios are
rushing to release DVD versions of popular movies.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the studios like DVD is because the system includes
special encryption technology which is supposed to make it
impossible to copy a DVD disk. But in November, computer hackers in
Norway unveiled a program called DeCSS which breaks the DVD
encryption system.
</P>
<P>
   Now the DVD Copy Control Association Inc., a DVD industry group,
is moving to prevent a wave of DVD piracy. The association filed
suit Monday in a California state court against dozens of Internet
sites, demanding that they stop distributing DeCSS.
</P>
<P>
   The association didn't just sue Web sites that feature DeCSS
software. It also demanded that dozens of Web pages remove links to
other sites where the software is available.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, many visitors to the popular technical Web site
Slashdot have posted messages which include links to DeCSS. The
lawsuit would require that Slashdot remove all such messages from
its site, arguing that merely posting links to the illegal software
is itself illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Information posted on Defendants' web sites establishes that
they are fully aware that, in posting or linking to the DeCSS
program, they are wrongfully appropriating proprietary trade
secrets.'' the association's complaint reads.
</P>
<P>
   The offices of the association are closed for the holidays, and
the group's attorney declined to speak with the Globe. But
reactions from others ranged from skepticism to outright hostility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gotta say, I wouldn't want to be them,'' said Jonathan
Zittrain, lecturer in Internet law at the Harvard Law School. For
one thing, Zittrain said that DeCSS may not be illegal in Norway,
where it was invented.
</P>
<P>
   That's certainly the view of one of the crackers, Frank
Stevenson, a programmer for a Norwegian game maker who helped
develop DeCSS as a hobby. ``This is what cryptographers do for
fun,'' Stevenson said. ``You get your hands on a new cryptosystem
and figure out if it's any good. I found out this one wasn't any
good.'' Stevenson said that in Norway, his actions are legal.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Zittrain said he doubted a judge would order the
operator of a Web site to stop linking to some other Web site. ``My
guess is that a judge is going to be pretty skeptical.''
</P>
<P>
   But earlier this month a federal judge in Utah issued a
temporary injunction that forced operators of a Web site to remove
links to pirated documents belonging to the Mormon church. The site
operators may appeal the injunction.
</P>
<P>
   Victory for the DVD industry could cause worries for a variety
of Internet services. For instance, Lycos Inc. of Waltham, Mass.
runs an index of music files on the Internet. Many of these files
are illegal copies of commercial recordings. A ruling in favor of
the DVD industry would raise the prospect that Lycos' music index
would either have to shut down, or be modified to ensure that only
legal recordings would be listed.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, angry visitors to Slashdot have discussed
holding a protest Wednesday at the Santa Clara County courthouse
where the suit has been filed. Other Slashdot users are urging
people to download DeCSS and to post it in as many places on the
Internet as possible, on the theory that it will be impossible to
shut all the sites down. And sites where the software is currently
available are receiving heavy traffic from people seeking to get a
copy for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``More people have downloaded the program from my server today
than in the last 30 days!'' wrote Slashdot user Andrew Thomas
McLaughlin, who is listed as a defendant in the suit. ``I suppose I
have the law firm to thank for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rob Malda, editor-in-chief at Slashdot, says he isn't worried
about the legal action against his site. Slashdot is now owned by
Andover.net Inc. of Acton, Mass., and Malda said he'll let the
company's attorneys worry about the matter.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that if the lawsuit is successful, there will be a
chilling effect on Internet free speech, because many people would
be afraid to link to someone else's Web site, which might contain
copyrighted material. ``That's the end of the First Amendment,''
Malda said.

BAY STATE MISSES OUT ON NOVEMBER HOME-BUYING SPREE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE BUTTERFIELD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Americans went on an unexpected home-buying spree
across much of the nation in November, but that zeal didn't spill
over into Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   While consumer confidence pushed up sales of existing homes a
suprising 6 percent nationally last month, home sales in
Massachusetts fell by 4.5 percent -- the fifth consecutive month
the volume of home sales has slipped in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials here said they expected the drop, attributing
it to seasonal buying habits that have traditionally resulted in
lower home sales in November. Despite the sales slowdown, they
note, average selling prices held relatively steady.
</P>
<P>
   The price of a single-family home in Massachusetts fell by just
0.3 percent in November, to $240,348, when compared to last
October.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got limited supply, and there continues to be strong
demand,'' insisted Fred Meyer, president of the Massachusetts
Association of Realtors. He said he expected the real estate market
to post another sales and price record this year when final figures
are tabulated next month.
</P>
<P>
   In the condominium market, the results were mixed. Sales were
down 5.7 percent last months when compared to October. Prices were
up 3.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists see the November housing figures as further
evidence that the market overall -- which has surged in each of the
last three years -- is truely beginng to moderate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Volumes are down a little, and that's a good thing. We need to
take a little heat out of this market,'' said Karl Case, a
professor of economics at Wellesley College. ``The boom is not
over, but it is showing signs of wearing thin,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Case said he did not expect housing prices to fall dramatically
as a result of lower sales volumes. But he said he did expect the
price increases to level off at about 10 percent per year.
</P>
<P>
   Until the November figures were released Tuesday, the trend in
the sale of existing homes both nationally and in Massachusetts had
been much the same. Volumes of homes sold have have been falling
since June, and were expected to continue to fall.
</P>
<P>
   But with consumer confidence reported at an all-time high by the
Conference Board, a New York research group, the national home
sales figures did a turnaround. A 6.6 percent drop in house sales
in October, compared to the previous month, was replaced with a 6
percent increase last month.
</P>
<P>
   In the Northeast, the National Association of Realtors reported
a 5.2 percent increase in the sale of existing homes in November.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts home sales numbers went in the opposite direction,
from 4,027 in October to 3,845 in November.
</P>
<P>
   The condominum market, formerly red hot in Massachusetts, saw
the biggest drop in sales volume, down from 1,115 units sold in
October to 1,052 sold in November. However, average selling price
rose slightly to $156,024 in November.

THYROID NODULE REMOVED FROM TIPPER GORE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and p coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN AND DOLORES KONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tipper Gore, wife of Vice President Al Gore, underwent surgery
Tuesday to remove a nodule from her thyroid gland. The nodule will
be examined for malignancy, though doctors said these small growths
are rarely a sign of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore accompanied his wife to Johns Hopkins
University Medical Center in Baltimore and stayed overnight with
her. The 51-year-old Mrs. Gore is expected to be released
Wednesday, although it isn't clear whether the medical condition
will affect her husband's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   News of the operation came as a surprise to members of the vice
president's campaign team, who believed the Gores were spending the
week between Christmas and New Year's at their farm in Carthage,
Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Camille Johnston, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Gore, said the nodule
was discovered during an examination for chronic neck pain that is
aggravated by exercise. She said the surgery was recommended as a
precautionary measure, and that results of the biopsy should be
known in about a week.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnston said Gore ``does not have a thyroid disease. There
are no symptoms of thyroid problems. Her hormonal surveys are
perfectly normal.''
</P>
<P>
   The thyroid gland, located in the neck, produces hormones that
regulate metabolism. Nodules on the thyroid are common and only
rarely cancerous, said physicians who treat thyroid disorders.
</P>
<P>
   One study found that four percent of people over 40 have thyroid
nodules, said Dr. Gary Cushing, head of the department of
endocrinology at Lahey Clinic in Burlington, Mass. About five
percent of people with nodules have thyroid cancer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nodules become more common with age, and about 50 percent of
Americans age 65 and older have them, according to Dr. Gilbert
Daniels, co-director of Thyroid Associates at Massachusetts General
Hospital and an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical
School.
</P>
<P>
   But the nodules are sometimes so small, that only 10 percent of
those 50 percent of older Americans with them ever have them
discovered, Daniels said.
</P>
<P>
   Once a nodule is found, usually during the course of a routine
physical, a so-called fine needle aspiration is typically done, to
take some tissue out of the lump for microscopic examination.
</P>
<P>
   Negative biopsy results are usually 98 to 99 percent accurate.
In that case, if the lump is small and doesn't bother the patient,
it does not have to be removed and may be treated with medication,
according to thyroid specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Only with suspicious or positive results are the nodules usually
removed, according to specialists.
</P>
<P>
   In Gore's case, the nodule was so small, it was not detectable
by casual touch and turned up only in a detailed couple of months
ago, according to Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   There was no biopsy done, but Gore's doctor watched the nodule
carefully and saw it had changed, although not drastically. ``It
was recommended as a precautionary measure,'' Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Udelsman of Johns Hopkins, a well-known endocrine
specialist, performed the surgery, Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
   Though the surgery occurred during a lull in what has been an
intense political season, the vice president is about to embark on
what may well be the most important 10 weeks of his political
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``As of right now, Al Gore plans to be back on the campaign
trail next week,'' Chris Lehane, the campaign press secretary, said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president is in a pitched battle to win the Iowa
caucuses Jan. 24 and the New Hampshire primary Feb. 1 against Bill
Bradley, the former New Jersey senator. The Democratic nomination
is likely to be determined by mid-March at the latest, after
primaries in New York, California and most of the Southern states.
</P>
<P>
   Since April, Mrs. Gore has been campaigning three to four days a
week for her husband. She has traveled extensively, delivered
speeches, and knocked on doors with campaign literature on the vice
president's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Though both Gore and his wife are avid joggers and outdoor
enthusiasts, cancer has touched the vice president, according to
medical records released this month. The records showed that he is
in excellent health, but in 1997 had a common form of skin cancer
removed from his right shoulder. In May, doctors removed what could
be a precursor to skin cancer from his forehead.

CLAYTON MOORE, 85; PORTRAYED LONE RANGER ON EARLY TV 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Fixes spelling of Brace Beemer; a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clayton Moore, whose portrayal of the The Lone Ranger defined
the moral code of the first TV generation in the 1950s, died
Tuesday of a heart attack at West Hills Hospital in Los Angeles. He
was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's passing, along with the recent deaths of Roy Rogers and
Gene Autry, and Rex Allen's demise last week, brings to a close an
era when the difference between good and evil was as plain as the
hat on your head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll wear the white hat the rest of my life,'' Moore said in a
1985 Los Angeles Times interview. ``The Lone Ranger is a great
character, a great American. Playing him made me a better person.''
</P>
<P>
   Some '50s TV actors couldn't wait to shed their TV personae.
George Reeves, who played the title role in the ``Superman'' series
saw himself as a serious performer and despised being stereotyped
as the Man of Steel. Ricky Nelson, who played a variation of
himself as the youngest son on ``Ozzie and Harriet,'' dropped the
``y'' from his name and wrote a hit song called ``Garden Party'' as
a plea to his fans to leave little Ricky behind. But not Moore. He
was, and will always be, The Lone Ranger.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949 no actor really wanted to try TV, especially at ABC, the
youngest of the three major networks. But Moore's career was stuck
in B movie quicksand and had been there since his screen debut in
the '30s. And, as a kid, he loved listening to Brace Beemer's
portrayal on the original radio dramas. So he signed on. After
playing the role for the first season, Moore, realizing the show's
popularity had increased ABC's visibility, asked for a raise. ABC
balked and Moore walked. He was replaced by John Hart for a few
months before winning his case and returning. Watching the Hart
episodes made it clear that without that rich, mellifluous voice,
The Lone Ranger was just another cowboy.
</P>
<P>
   Children in the 1950s sang the trademark theme from ``The
William Tell Overture,'' mailed in cereal box tops for the toy
silver bullets, and chanted the Ranger's cry of ``Hi-Yo, Silver!''
in their playtimes.
</P>
<P>
   What made The Lone Ranger special is that he never killed
anyone; he was sensitive to Indians in an age before they were
referred to as Native Americans and he was sincere.
</P>
<P>
   In the '60s, militant Native Americans adopted the term Tonto to
specify the Native American version of the African-American
designation, Uncle Tom. But The Lone Ranger, particularly in both
his feature-length films _ ``The Lone Ranger'' (1956) and ``The
Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold'' (1958) _ was light years
ahead of most western characters. Both films feature evil settlers
trying to steal from the Indians and Mexicans of the time. Not, as
was the convention, the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's resiliance was put to the test in 1979 when the
producers of a feature-length re-make of ``The Lone Ranger,''
starring Klinton Spilsbury, won a court battle preventing Moore
from making appearances as The Lone Ranger and from wearing the
famous mask. Moore continued making personal appearances in
wraparound sunglasses, but it wasn't the same. He fought back. The
movie flopped when it was finally released in 1981 and, in 1984,
the court ruled that Moore could, once again, don the mask.
</P>
<P>
   It may be inappropriate to suggest, in an appreciation, that
Moore wasn't much of an actor. But he was an exceptional Lone
Ranger. Because, for him, it wasn't a role, it was a way of life.
And, while Moore never wrote any scripts, he did come up with what
he called The Lone Ranger Creed:
</P>
<P>
   Some excerpts:
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe:
</P>
<P>
   _ That to have a friend, a man must be one.
</P>
<P>
   _ That God put the firewood there, but every man must gather and
light it himself.
</P>
<P>
   _ That men should live by the rule of what is best for the
greatest number.
</P>
<P>
   _ That sooner or later, somewhere, somehow, we must settle with
the world and make payment for what we have taken.
</P>
<P>
   _ That all things change but truth, and that truth alone lives
on forever.''
</P>
<P>
   In his code, there is the sense of environmental awareness,
democratic ideals, anti-imperialist doctrine and Emersonian
self-reliance. A fine code in anyone's book.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children need heroes like the Lone Ranger,'' Moore told The
Associated Press in 1986. ``This is important because these kids
are young America. They are going to be running this country some
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore was born Sept. 14, 1914 _ some sources give an earlier
year _ in Chicago, son of a real estate developer.
</P>
<P>
   He was largely retired in recent years, living at his home in
Calabasas, near Los Angeles. Moore is survived by his wife,
Clarita, and his daughter, Dawn Moore Gerrity. He had been married
previously to actress Sally Allen, who died in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Those who grew up dreaming of silver bullets can shut their eyes
now and hear, off in the distance, ``Hi, Yo! Silver, away!''
Somewhere, rattling off the broadcast satellites circling the
planet, The Lone Ranger rides again.

   In a conversation in Madison magazine, humorist and humor
deconstructionist  &UR; Eric Idle &LR;  explains to  &UR; Carrie Fisher &LR;  that
comedians can be divided into two groups:
</P>
<P>
   The red-nosed clown is life affirming, ``and you love him and he
makes fart jokes and he's always talking about his dick and he's
sort of derived from Pan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And then there's the white-faced clown. He never takes a pie
in the face, he's always wearing the white makeup, he usually plays
the trumpet, and he's very distancing; he's the controlling one.
He's always kicking the red-nosed clown, tripping him and making
all the jokes at his expense.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, says Idle,  &UR; Woody Allen  &LR; always plays the red-nosed
clown, &LR;  but ``is clearly a white-face. He's written it all.'' Dame
 &UR; Edna Everage &LR;  is red nosed, but his lines are conceived by the
``white face inside.''  &UR; John Cleese &LR; , who used to tell laughing
audiences to shut up, is white face, as is  &UR; Lenny &LR; 
 &UR; Bruce &LR; .  &UR; Robin Williams  &LR; is a ``real red-nose,'' says Idle.

<P>
   HOLYOKE, Mass. _ Five years ago Jonathan Houle was feeling
hopeless, ready jump off a highway overpass, when Officer John
DiNapoli spotted him and stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Houle's former DARE teacher eventually talked him down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be around now if he hadn't recognized me,'' said
Houle, 21, recalling the incident as he walked over a mile from his
house Tuesday to attend DiNapoli's funeral. ``He stopped, brought
me home and kept me safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of other mourners, including police officers from
several states, filled the pews at Immaculate Conception Church to
honor DiNapoli, 52, who was shot while chasing a suspect six days
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he was remembered as a loving father and dedicated
officer, DiNapoli's accused killer sat in the backseat of an
unmarked police cruiser speeding north from Pennsylvania to
Massachusetts _ with DiNapoli's handcuffs around his wrists.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Morales, a Holyoke resident with a lengthy police record,
went home willingly, according to police in Scranton, Pa., who
arrested Morales Monday in a strip mall parking lot after
monitoring his moves for a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Morales, 27, evaded police for five days after the Dec. 22
shooting. He told police he had argued with several people that day
shortly before DiNapoli left his desk duty job to respond to a call
of people arguing.
</P>
<P>
   Before DiNapoli arrived, Morales left the scene to get a gun,
police said. When he returned, Morales found DiNapoli's unmarked
cruiser, which followed him down the street. Morales then allegedly
turned and fired five shots into the windshield, mortally wounding
DiNapoli, according to Scranton Detective Teddy Maus.
</P>
<P>
   Morales repeatedly said he thought the driver was one of the
people he was arguing with _ not a police officer, according to
Scranton police.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Morales waived his right to a hearing in Lackawanna
County Court and agreed to return to Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my understanding you want to return and face the music,''
Judge James Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to go today,'' replied Morales, who is charged with
first-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   He was turned over to Holyoke authorities, and arrived in the
city around 4:15 p.m. accompanied by three State police officers,
who used DiNapoli's handcuffs for the final ride north.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday's extradition was cold comfort to those who knew
DiNapoli as an officer and friend.
</P>
<P>
   Like a neverending stream of blue-black ink, hundreds upon
hundreds of police officers walked several blocks _ at one point
crossing beneath two raised firetruck ladders draped in the
American flag _ to the church. The multitude of officers stretched
two blocks long and over a dozen rows deep until one row blended
with the next. They stood outside for over two hours in the biting
cold to honor their fallen brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is it that gave John the courage to wear that badge?''
asked Hampden County District Attorney William M. Bennett. ``It was
love. Love of his community, love of his neighbors...love for doing
what was right. For 21 years John wore that badge with honor and
nobility in his heart,'' said Bennett, who held DiNapoli's badge in
his hand just after he died.
</P>
<P>
   More than one speaker at the mass highlighted DiNapoli's
consistent generosity and courage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generous, giving, always willing to go beyond what is
generally asked of anyone _ that made him who he was,'' said parish
priest, the Rev. Thomas Reilly, at the standing-room-only funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Reading from the work of William Shakespeare and the quotations
of Mark Twain, DiNapoli's fiancee Carol Bevan-Bogart recalled her
``friend and companion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always made me laugh, always brightened my day and I will
miss him for the rest of my life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   DiNapoli was born and raised in Holyoke and moved to South
Hadley seven years ago. His adult daughter, Jobeth DiNapoli spoke
of his grand sense of humor and love of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you knew my father, you could probably tell at least one
funny John DiNapoli story,'' she said, standing alongside her
brother Andrew.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our dad was the only dad who'd regularly play in the
neighborhood kickball games....Somehow Andy would always end up on
the opposite team. And we would watch my big brother cry when his
team lost,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Along with his children and fiancee, DiNapoli is survived by his
mother, Myra; sister, June Sullivan; and ex-wife Joanne
Silverstris.
</P>
<P>
   As a tribute to DiNapoli's legacy, city police cruisers will
soon sport the letters WWJDD -- What Would John DiNapoli Do? _ a
takeoff of the popular slogan What Would Jesus Do?.
</P>
<P>
   DiNapoli's daughter knew the answer Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
   ``John DiNapoli would not mourn a death, but instead would
celebrate a life,'' JoBeth DiNapoli said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are and always will be my hero'' she added, tearfully
clutching her father's uniform hat. He was laid to rest at
Forestdale Cemetery in Holyoke.
</P>
<P>
   Houle, who says he owes his life to DiNapoli, wants to one day
wear the signature police hat and badge himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said if anything ever happened to him, he wanted me to
become a police officer and I said `no problem,''' Houle said. ``I
made that promise and I'm going to keep that promise.''

 &HT;    Family, friends remember soul great Curtis Mayfield
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As quietly as his warm falsetto, rhythm-and-blues
great Curtis Mayfield was remembered Tuesday afternoon at a private
ceremony in Sandy Springs, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than 100 family members and close friends gathered at H.M.
Patterson and Son's Arlington Chapel for a 90 minute-plus service.
Attendees included his former bandmates Jerry Butler, Fred Cash and
Sam Gooden of the Impressions; producer-executive Tony Mercedes;
and Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield, 57, died Sunday morning from ``complications due to
quadriplegia and diabetes,'' said Warner Bros. records spokeswoman
Karen Lee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good that he's finally feeling better,'' Cash said of
Mayfield, who performed ``People Get Ready'' and other hits with
the Impressions. ``I just talked to him last week, so I knew where
he was before he left this earth. And it was not a good place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know him but I knew his work,'' added Mercedes, who's
worked with pop trio TLC and rapper J.T. Money. ``So much of what's
out here now, that's good _ rap and R&AMP;B _ comes from what this man
did. And I just came here to show my respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Longtime manager Marvin Heiman, who started planning for the
services Christmas Eve, said ``we wanted this to be a celebration
of his life, not the mourning of his death.''
</P>
<P>
   The service varied from the program a little, with Mayor
Campbell offering what Mayfield meant to his life and members of
the Impressions doing an impromptu rendering of ``Amen.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee said a public memorial is planned for later this month,
possibly in Los Angeles. Details will be announced next week.
</P>
<P>
   For four decades, Mayfield made soul music for the heart and
mind, first with the R&AMP;B group the Impressions on such
gospel-inflected singles as ``It's All Right,'' and then as a solo
singer-songwriter with the grittier and more insightful ``We People
Who Are Darker Than Blue,'' the ``Superfly'' soundtrack and his
last album of original work, the 1996 Grammy-nominated ``New World
Order.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago native, who had made Atlanta his home for more than
20 years, died at 7:20 a.m. Sunday at North Fulton Regional
Hospital in Roswell, Ga. He had been paralyzed from the neck down
since an onstage lighting tower fell on him in Brooklyn in 1990.
Last year his right leg was amputated as a result of the diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield is survived by his wife, Altheida; sons Kirk, Curtis
III, LiBrian, Cheaa, Blaise, Tracy and Todd Mayfield; daughters
Timfany, Lena, Sharon and Carol Mayfield; and seven grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   His body will be cremated.

 &HT;    From Millenios to $300 Tiffany noise marker, Y2K memrabilia
could be worth millions
 &HT;    By Jill Young Miller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have you snapped up your ``millennium collectible'' yet? What,
no cake plate, clock or corkscrew? No snow globe or goblet? Nothing
from the wave of stuff that has washed up on store shelves?
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen any evidence people are buying it,'' says
collector extraordinaire Al Hoff, a trend watcher and author of
``Thrift Score.'' ``I don't see anyone wearing it or talking about
it. The whole millennium thing seems to have not kicked off.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoff did indulge in one item herself: A can of Y2K Spaghetti Os
_ with 2s added to the 0s. ``It made me laugh,'' she says. Whether
she'll be laughing to the bank in 30 years is anybody's guess,
though, which brings us around to the most important piece of
advice from the experts: If you're eager to collect Y2K
memorabilia, get what you truly like _ and if it goes up in value,
consider yourself lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it will have no value,'' says Marie Kowalik,
president of Great Gatsby's Auction Gallery in Chamblee. ``Will any
of it? Absolutely. What will that be? I have no idea. There's no
crystal ball. ... If people knew, that's what they would collect
and everyone would be millionaires.''
</P>
<P>
   Think Christmas-tree ornaments this year, suggests Terry Kovel,
co-author with her husband, Ralph, of ``Kovels' Antiques &AMP;
Collectibles Price List.'' 1999 and 2000 ornaments still should be
easy to find, and they're ``crossover'' collectibles, which means
more than one group of collectors may yearn for them later: A 1999
ornament might appeal to someone who collects ornaments and to
someone looking for turn-of-the-millennium memorabilia. Other
examples are bells, candy containers, salt- and pepper-shakers,
handkerchiefs and letter openers, Kovel says.
</P>
<P>
   She collects textiles. Her Y2K purchase? A $65 silk scarf with
people, bells and ``2000'' emblazoned on it. Will its value
increase? ``I don't know. I just liked it, and I'm going to wear
it.''
</P>
<P>
   If you like Barbie enough to plunk down $40, check out
Millennium Princess Barbie, suggests Sharon Korbeck, editor of
Warman's Today's Collector magazine. ``Barbies are hot, it's nicely
done, it's her anniversary year. So Barbie's got everything going
for her.'' The doll wraps up 1999 in a blue velvet gown overlaid
with sparkling lace. She also has a ``crystal'' ball, something
millennium-stuff revelers could use to decide what to buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody laughs at me, but I keep telling people to pick up
the millennium Cheerios,'' Korbeck says. They're called Millenios,
and, like Spaghettios, ``2''s are added to the regular ``O''s.
Korbeck's not keeping the cereal, just the box, which is designed
to double as a cardboard time capsule. ``They're not going to make
Millenios after the beginning of the year, and everybody's going to
throw the boxes away,'' Korbeck says. ``Whether it sounds weird or
not, it's much better I think than picking up a porcelain plate
that says 2000 on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another piece of advice from the experts: Choose something well
made, be it a toy or a champagne glass. And if the item has
intrinsic value _ silver or crystal, say _ so much the better.
</P>
<P>
   But if you'd like to pick up a $27 Tiffany &AMP; Co. crystal
champagne flute with ``2000'' engraved around it, you're out of
luck _ for now. ``They're completely sold out,'' says Tom Carroll,
vice president of Tiffany's Mid-Atlantic region. ``We put them in
our summer catalog, and we knew we had a problem immediately, they
were so popular.'' The glasses will be available again in the
spring, he says. In the meantime, how about a $225 sterling silver
party hat or a $300 noisemaker?
</P>
<P>
   Pass the Millenios.

TREASURY PRICES DROP SLIGHTLY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)   (rk) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Prices of Treasury securities fell modestly Tuesday
in thin and listless trading, as fresh economic data heightened
investor concern about another rate increase.
</P>
<P>
   By late in the day the price of the 30-year benchmark bond was
down 4/32 to 95 14/32, while the yield, which moves in the opposite
direction, increased to 6.47 percent, from 6.46 percent on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Reports on consumer confidence and home sales exceeded market
forecasts, solidifying the already increasing expectations that the
Federal Reserve will increase rates as soon as February to slow
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management said
Tuesday's data was strongly indicative of continued economic
momentum in excess of what is generally considered to be the
maximum noninflationary trend rate of growth. ``Indeed, the
Conference Board's consumer confidence index rose sharply and
somewhat unexpectedly in December to 141.4, approaching the record
level of 142.3 registered in October 1968,'' Fine said. ``Quite
obviously, consumers remain highly optimistic, and are likely to
continue to spend freely over the near-term.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Meanwhile,'' he added, ``the 6 percent jump in November
existing home sales was a clear signal that the housing market,
while perhaps past its peak, is still quite vibrant, and is not yet
displaying any signs of an impending economic slowdown.''
</P>
<P>
   The session lows came after the National Association of Realtors
said existing home sales rebounded last month after four straight
months of declines. Sales rose to a seasonally adjusted 5.09
million annual rate in November, above economists' forecasts for a
5 million rate.
</P>
<P>
   With the unemployment rate currently at a very low 4.1 percent
and gross domestic product growth at a blistering 5.7 percent pace
for the third quarter and widely projected to show continued
strength for the fourth quarter, Fine said the members of the Fed's
policy-setting committee ``must be squirming in their seats as they
nervously analyze this steady stream of buoyant economic data,
which at the same time is further solidifying the already
widespread expectation of bond market participants of further
tightening by the Fed during the first quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the stock and bond markets have largely uncoupled in
recent weeks, the strength in the stock market also pressured bond
investors, with some buyers of government securities electing
instead to dabble in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The only economic indicator left for 1999 that could move the
market is a report on regional manufacturing activity by the
Purchasing Management Association of Chicago, slated for release
this Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The survey is closely watched for trends in nationwide
manufacturing activity. But investors are already looking to data
due out in early January, including the December jobs report, the
December survey of the National Association of Purchasing
Management and inflation indicators.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the bond market can be expected to get some support
from investors attracted to the current high yields, Treasuries
might not fall much further. Bonds have registered their worst
annual performance since the Treasury began selling the 30-year
issue regularly in 1977. They have handed investors losses of 12.6
percent this year, taking reinvested interest into account.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Look around. If you think beyond millennium knickknacks, you'll
find that you probably already own some worthy keepsakes from our
time in history.
</P>
<P>
   Think handwritten letters, cassette recordings, sheet music,
telephones with cords, even ashtrays. ``Anything that's going to
become obsolete, that's what you should save,'' says Miriam Plans,
a Vero Beach, Fla., author of books and articles about collecting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt very much if your old PC is going to be worth much,
but you never know,'' says Paul Brown, spokesman for Red Baron's
Antiques in Atlanta. ``If you have an iMac, perhaps in 100 years
that will be studied as an icon of design in the late 20th
century.''
</P>
<P>
   Save magazines and newspapers that encapsulate the past century
or chronicle the turn of the millennium. Set aside some 1999
commemorative state quarters. Hang onto those fast food toys. Keep
a pack of Pokemon cards. ``As an investment, I wouldn't bank my
kid's college fund on it by stocking up on Pokemon cards, but you
never know,'' Brown says.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Kovel, co-author with her husband of Kovels' Antiques &AMP;
Collectibles Price List, suggests keeping sports watches and even
Nike shoes, which she says ``represent the era so very well.''
</P>
<P>
   And don't toss out those New Year's Eve event programs and party
favors. Says John A. Shuman, an antiques expert in Pottstown, Pa.:
``Anything with those logos and the whoop and holler that deals
with that phenomenon as we go from 1999 to 2000 probably will be
worth saving.''

made, be it a toy or a champagne glass. And if the item has

champagne flute with ``2000'' engraved around it, you're out of
luck _ for now. ``They're completely sold out,'' says Tom Carroll,
vice president of Tiffany's Mid-Atlantic region. ``We put them in
our summer catalog, and we knew we had a problem immediately, they
were so popular.'' The glasses will be available again in the
spring, he says. In the meantime, how about a $225 sterling silver
party hat or a $300 noisemaker?

 &HT;    From Millenios to $300 Tiffany noise marker, Y2K memrabilia
could be worth millions
 &HT;    By Jill Young Miller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have you snapped up your ``millennium collectible'' yet? What,
no cake plate, clock or corkscrew? No snow globe or goblet? Nothing
from the wave of stuff that has washed up on store shelves?
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen any evidence people are buying it,'' says
collector extraordinaire Al Hoff, a trend watcher and author of
``Thrift Score.'' ``I don't see anyone wearing it or talking about
it. The whole millennium thing seems to have not kicked off.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoff did indulge in one item herself: A can of Y2K Spaghetti Os
_ with 2s added to the 0s. ``It made me laugh,'' she says. Whether
she'll be laughing to the bank in 30 years is anybody's guess,
though, which brings us around to the most important piece of
advice from the experts: If you're eager to collect Y2K
memorabilia, get what you truly like _ and if it goes up in value,
consider yourself lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it will have no value,'' says Marie Kowalik,
president of Great Gatsby's Auction Gallery in Chamblee. ``Will any
of it? Absolutely. What will that be? I have no idea. There's no
crystal ball. ... If people knew, that's what they would collect
and everyone would be millionaires.''
</P>
<P>
   Think Christmas-tree ornaments this year, suggests Terry Kovel,
co-author with her husband, Ralph, of ``Kovels' Antiques &AMP;
Collectibles Price List.'' 1999 and 2000 ornaments still should be
easy to find, and they're ``crossover'' collectibles, which means
more than one group of collectors may yearn for them later: A 1999
ornament might appeal to someone who collects ornaments and to
someone looking for turn-of-the-millennium memorabilia. Other
examples are bells, candy containers, salt- and pepper-shakers,
handkerchiefs and letter openers, Kovel says.
</P>
<P>
   She collects textiles. Her Y2K purchase? A $65 silk scarf with
people, bells and ``2000'' emblazoned on it. Will its value
increase? ``I don't know. I just liked it, and I'm going to wear
it.''
</P>
<P>
   If you like Barbie enough to plunk down $40, check out
Millennium Princess Barbie, suggests Sharon Korbeck, editor of
Warman's Today's Collector magazine. ``Barbies are hot, it's nicely
done, it's her anniversary year. So Barbie's got everything going
for her.'' The doll wraps up 1999 in a blue velvet gown overlaid
with sparkling lace. She also has a ``crystal'' ball, something
millennium-stuff revelers could use to decide what to buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody laughs at me, but I keep telling people to pick up
the millennium Cheerios,'' Korbeck says. They're called Millenios,
and, like Spaghettios, ``2''s are added to the regular ``O''s.
Korbeck's not keeping the cereal, just the box, which is designed
to double as a cardboard time capsule. ``They're not going to make
Millenios after the beginning of the year, and everybody's going to
throw the boxes away,'' Korbeck says. ``Whether it sounds weird or
not, it's much better I think than picking up a porcelain plate
that says 2000 on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another piece of advice from the experts: Choose something well
made, be it a toy or a champagne glass. And if the item has
intrinsic value _ silver or crystal, say _ so much the better.
</P>
<P>
   But if you'd like to pick up a $27 Tiffany &AMP; Co. crystal
champagne flute with ``2000'' engraved around it, you're out of
luck _ for now. ``They're completely sold out,'' says Tom Carroll,
vice president of Tiffany's Mid-Atlantic region. ``We put them in
our summer catalog, and we knew we had a problem immediately, they
were so popular.'' The glasses will be available again in the

TERROR IN MEXICO'S DRUG TRADE, BEGINNING IN A JUAREZ SALOON 
</HEADLINE>
 (jw) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico _ The spectacle this month of the Mexican
and U.S. authorities' digging up bodies on remote ranches near this
border city has a lot to do with what happened two years ago in one
of this city's better-known saloons.
</P>
<P>
   Three yuppies of the drug trade, young smugglers from El Paso,
were celebrating one more successful deal on Jan. 10, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   After dinner in Juarez, they entered the Kentucky Bar for a
night of drinking. Even before the drinks arrived, armed men
dressed in black burst in shouting ``judicial police!'' and began
beating them with assault rifles. The Americans were forced into a
waiting Chevrolet Suburban and carried away. Their relatives never
saw them again.
</P>
<P>
   The brazen abduction followed a pattern almost routine here
since 1993, in which more than 100 people vanished after being
grabbed by armed men who identified themselves as policemen.
</P>
<P>
   One of the worst kept secrets of this rough-and-tumble city is
that the federal police appear to have collaborated with drug
traffickers by taking part in abductions, beatings and killings.
Even the special prosecutor appointed by the attorney general says
that in 45 disappearance investigations, he has found evidence of
federal police involvement in every case. Witnesses have reported
seeing policemen take part in abductions. Others report seeing
victims in the custody of the police.
</P>
<P>
   But no investigation had led anywhere until that night at the
Kentucky Bar.
</P>
<P>
   Because American citizens were involved, a young FBI agent in El
Paso began looking into it, eventually piecing together much of the
puzzle and learning of a site in Mexico where some of the victims
may have been buried.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the United States and Mexico began the
operation to dig up bones at four ranches near Juarez. So far,
remains of nine bodies have been unearthed, a modest but not
insignificant achievement in what is one of the largest law
enforcement operations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little indication so far that the investigation has
done much to curb the purported collusion between the Mexican
police and drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's never been any serious Mexican investigation,'' said
Victor Clark Alfaro, a human rights leader who has studied the
cases of dozens of people who have disappeared in northern Mexico.
``These abductions are carried out by an alliance between organized
crime and government officials, and since the victims are people
with ties to traffickers, authorities don't take them seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the exhumations continue, officials of both the United
States and Mexico have shrouded the investigation in secrecy. But
some details, including those surrounding the Kentucky Bar, have
emerged from interviews with people who have been questioned by the
FBI. Some of their information has been confirmed by U.S. court
records and other interviews. One of the major sources for this
article, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity, was
described by Enrique Cocina Perez, Mexico's special prosecutor for
the Juarez disappearances, as a key figure in the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, after examining materials from this report for several
days, declined to comment on specific points. ``There were hundreds
of persons involved in this, so you can't present this as the
overall story,'' said David Alba, the FBI special agent in charge
in El Paso, suggesting that there were elements of the
investigation that had not been revealed.
</P>
<P>
   The three Americans celebrating in the bar that night were
Eduardo Barragan, Jorge Luis Garibay and Guadalupe Matthew Baca.
They were residents of El Paso in their 30s, and Barragan was well
known locally as the gregarious and attractive scion of a wealthy
family.
</P>
<P>
   When he attended Burges High School El Paso in the 1980s,
Barragan drove a DeLorean sports car. His sister Cecilia, who is
Baca's wife, said in an interview that the family wealth derived
from legitimate businesses, including the limousine service her
brother owned. When Barragan disappeared, however, his father,
Henry Barragan, was serving time in a federal prison on charges of
cocaine trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   All three men in the bar that night were participants in a
smuggling group with a $3 million-a-month contract to the Juarez
drug cartel, according to a person familiar with their activities.
Their business was to take possession of tons of marijuana in
Juarez and carry the loads across the bridges to warehouses in El
Paso, the person said.
</P>
<P>
   Their abduction was witnessed by dozens of passers-by, making it
similar to many other disappearance cases. In some of those
instances, men with police credentials have blocked off Juarez
streets to pull victims out of cars. In others, uniformed policemen
have carried people away after smashing into their homes.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In a few cases, the victims have been seen later in Federal
Police custody. On several occasions, Juarez city police officers
have witnessed the abductions and filed reports, but the reports
later disappeared from official files.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1997, relatives of people who disappeared from Juarez and
El Paso have clamored for justice through an association. Its
leaders have compiled a list of 196 people who have disappeared
since 1993. The Juarez newspaper, Norte, has counted 120 people who
vanished. The missing include 22 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   After the three Americans were dragged from the Kentucky Bar,
Barragan's family made contact with the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   According to a person familiar with the inquiry, intelligence
information led FBI agents to focus early attention on Jose Ismael
Cruz, a 29-year-old Mexican who had been a minor employee in the
Americans' smuggling group, driving marijuana across the bridges.
Within days after the abductions, Cruz took over the smuggling
contract previously held by the missing Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Two months after the three disappeared, FBI agents arrested two
of Cruz's employees as they crossed into El Paso with 1.5 tons of
marijuana. Once in custody, the men agreed to provide evidence
against Cruz, Ray Velarde, Cruz's lawyer, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next year, they and other confidential informants
provided the FBI with detailed information on Cruz's operations.
Last April, 13 months after the first arrests, agents raided an El
Paso drug warehouse disguised as a plastics recycling plant,
seizing 4.5 tons of marijuana and arresting three more of Cruz's
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz was arrested in June, after a wild car chase that began
when FBI agents intercepted him as he drove away from an El Paso
bar, and ended when several agents crashed their cars into his BMW.
Cruz is in an El Paso jail awaiting trial on charges of resisting
arrest and conspiracy to distribute marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   In the debriefing sessions of Cruz's associates, FBI agents
heard theories about why the Americans were abducted, according to
a person familiar with the inquiry. One was that Cruz was so
determined to rise in the trafficking world that he had organized a
virtual coup against his smuggling employers, hiring Mexican
policemen well known in Juarez as contract assassins to execute the
Americans. Others said the Americans were drug soldiers killed in a
larger battle raging at the time between rival cartel leaders.
</P>
<P>
   One of the people cooperating with the FBI provided a horrifying
witness account of the Americans' last hours. They were taken to a
Juarez mansion, where the police assassins and Cruz beat them
savagely, ignoring pleas for mercy, and kicking them endlessly
after they had slumped to the floor. By the time the witness left
the scene, it was unclear if they were dead or alive, and Cruz's
cowboy boots were drenched in blood.
</P>
<P>
   After the newspaper Norte identified Cruz as the organizer of
the Americans' disappearance, Cruz denied the accusations in a
jail-house conversation with his lawyer, Velarde said.
</P>
<P>
   During the FBI's questioning of Cruz's associates, one of the
informants said he thought he knew where the missing Americans
might be buried; he identified several ranches in and around
Juarez, where the police were known to bury their victims,
according to two people who have been interviewed repeatedly by the
FBI.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI agents were not the only investigators hearing reports
about the grave sites. So was Cocina, the Mexican special
prosecutor looking into the disappearances.
</P>
<P>
   He was the fourth in a series of prosecutors to take on the
cases, and all of his predecessors had had a dismal record. The
first fell asleep during depositions, and two others were accused
of crimes and dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Cocina quickly waded into the details of dozens of
cases, said Jaime Hervella, the El Paso accountant who founded the
relatives' association. Cocina told association leaders that he had
taken federal jurisdiction over 45 investigations and had found
evidence of involvement by federal police officers in every case.
Cocina collected photographs and thick files on many of the suspect
officers, Hervella said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Cocina declined to be interviewed. But people familiar with his
inquiry said he was told in detail about the clandestine graveyards
as early as last spring. He had the jurisdiction to seek a search
warrant and carry out the excavations without the FBI help but did
not.
</P>
<P>
   One day last summer, however, Cocina met with three FBI agents
at their El Paso offices. A person who took part in the meeting
said Cocina laid out aerial photos and topographical maps of the
Juarez region, which Mexican and American investigators had used to
pinpoint graveyard sites.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, the FBI agents requested help from
Washington, and negotiations ensued with Mexico that led to the
digging late this year at the grave site in Juarez.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   After a convoy of FBI forensic experts drove into Mexico on Nov.
29, many Mexicans questioned why their government had allowed FBI
agents to operate on Mexican soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was obvious that the U.S. pressured Mexico to carry out the
exhumations,'' Sen. Alfredo Aguilar Zinser, one of the operation's
most outspoken Mexican critics, said in an interview. ``The Mexican
attorney general allowed foreign agents into Mexico because he
hadn't done his own proper investigation. Now we're in the
humiliating position of letting theU.S. come in to do a job that
he didn't do.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The day the exhumations began, an FBI agent made contact with
Barragan's sister, requesting dental records for her brother and
husband. Both men were in the Kentucky Bar that night and were
never seen again. None of the nine bodies has been positively
identified, however, and the digging continues.

CONSUMERS CONTINUE SPENDING SPREE AMID SURGING OPTIMISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Consumer confidence soared to a 31-year-high in December as
Americans continued a vigorous spending spree that culminated in
another season of strong holiday purchases.
</P>
<P>
   The Conference Board in its monthly report, released Tuesday,
said its index of consumer confidence soared more than four points,
to 141.4 in December from a November reading of 137, which was
revised upward from an earlier estimate. The December index was its
highest level since a Vietnam War-fed expansion pushed the index to
142.3 in October 1968.
</P>
<P>
   A stream of holiday sales reports released Tuesday also
underscored the economy's strength as the year comes to an end:
Consumers spent between 5 percent and 6 percent more during the
week before Christmas 1999 than they spent during the same week
last year. When final figures are in, holiday spending may even top
the most optimistic predictions.
</P>
<P>
   The new reports provide more evidence indicating the economy has
picked up steam in the latter half of this year, economists said. A
combination of low inflation, low unemployment and a booming stock
market have helped keep the economy growing for more than eight
years.
</P>
<P>
   If the the nation's computer systems ride through the millennial
date change this weekend without causing serious disruptions in
commerce, growth is expected to be strong again next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers aren't ready to retreat from the malls,'' said Lynn
Franco, economist for the Conference Board in New York, just
because the holiday rush is over. ``They intend to continue
spending and will continue to fuel the economy. This should spill
over into the first quarter of 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the holiday spirit added to consumers' high, but the
confidence index is seasonally adjusted to minimize the impact of
the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, economists say, the later stage of the
current expansion, which has lasted more than eight years, has been
driven by free-spending consumers. The nation's consumers account
for about two-thirds of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   During December, workers, using their Christmas bonuses and
credit cards, continued their buying spree, while wealthy
individuals lavished big gifts paid for with gains made on their
stock portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same forces leading to very robust retail sales are
producing very high consumer confidence _ lots of jobs, low
inflation, lots of wealth in the stock market and wealth in house
prices,'' said economist Nicholas Perna of Perna Associates. ``It
doesn't get any better than this.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, stock portfolios got even fatter as the major stock
index, the Dow Jones industrial average, rose 85.63 points and made
a new record, 11,476.71. The overheated Nasdaq, which has been run
up by inflated prices for Internet and computer companies,
retreated Tuesday by 3.27 points, closing at 3,972.11.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraging the optimism about the economy was a recent report
that third-quarter growth this year was stronger than had been
expected. The government said gross domestic product, driven by
strong consumer spending and business investment, posted a stellar
5.7 percent rise, annualized, during the fourth quarter _ up from
preliminary estimates of 5.2 percent growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The official numbers don't even capture all of it,'' said
Jeremy Hildreth, senior economist for American Skandia Life
Assurance Inc. in Connecticut. ``Software and cell phones are
barely counted in the GDP report, and these are big and
increasingly important economic developments.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditional manfactured items also sold well this year. For
example, DaimlerChrysler AG announced Tuesday that worldwide sales
of Mercedes-Benz luxury models and its jazzy Smart Car, a
two-seater that is popular for squeezing into small parking spaces
in European cities, jumped 13.4 percent last year. The automaker
credited strong sales in the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasts of economic growth for all of 1999 put growth at about
4 percent. If these estimates prove accurate, the economy would
post growth of at least 4 percent for a third consecutive year. In
year 2000, Hildreth sees ``more of the same,'' though he forecast
growth slowing to about 3.5 percent or less.
</P>
<P>
   Economists expect Federal Reserve Board hikes in interest rates,
which began last summer, to temper the sizzling economy.
</P>
<P>
   But if the spending continues at its breakneck pace, economists
predicted it would make the Fed more inclined to again raise rates
at its next meeting, which is scheduled for Feb. 2 and 3.
</P>
<P>
   Despite concerns the economy is growing too fast, the Fed voted
at its last meeting, three days before Christmas, to abstain from a
rate hike largely out of fear that it might jolt the economy at a
time financial markets are already nervous about the Y2K date
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``If consumers keep spending like there's no tomorrow, the Fed
may have to put on the brakes,'' Perna said.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Moran, a senior economist for the US Department of
Commerce, said personal consumption expenditures in the fourth
quarter are rising only slightly less than last year. In the fourth
quarter of 1998, consumer spending rose 4.6 over the prior quarter.
Nevertheless, Moran said, ``Consumer spending has been very strong
for the last two years.''
</P>
<P>
   That spending was capped by 1999 holiday sales that are believed
to be the strongest in a decade. Estimates indicate that holiday
retail sales will be $185 billion or more, though firm numbers
won't begin trickling in until early January. Online shopping
accounted for anywhere from $6 billion to $15 billion of holiday
sales, according to various estimates.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of 80 retailers released Tuesday by Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd. estimated same-store sales, or sales at
stores open at least a year, during the week ending on Christmas
day were 5.9 percent higher than last year, while LRJ Redbook said
Christmas-week sales rose 4.9 percent. For all of December, the
Redbook index was up 4.3 percent from December 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of Tokyo said that demand for jewelry, cashmere sweaters,
Pokemon toys and digital video disk players have lifted sales every
week since Thanksgiving, with a peak of 7.9 percent the week ended
Dec. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Holiday spending ``is up, up, up,'' said William Ford, economist
for Houston-based TeleCheck Services Inc., which tracks retail
sales by surveying 27,000 retailers.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, a 6.8 percent increase in same-store sales
during the Christmas shopping season was the biggest of any state,
tying with Hawaii, Telecheck estimated. Nationwide, same-store
sales during Christmas are about 6.2 percent above last year; when
sales by online retailers and new stores are included, the figure
may be close to 8 percent, said Telecheck.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said that consumers in Massachusetts, who enjoy one of the
lowest unemployment rates in the nation, spent even more, on
average, than did US consumers. In Boston, the average check
written by holiday shoppers was about $114.81, compared with a
$97.28 nationwide, Ford said. ``There are a lot of affluent people
writing bigger and bigger checks. In Boston, the checks are $10
bigger than they were last year.''

SOME FEDERAL AGENCIES TO CLOSE WEB SITES FOR Y2K 

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal officials stepped up efforts Tuesday to
reassure Americans of no impending disasters resulting from
computer malfunctions when the calendar rolls over to Year 2000 on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some federal agencies, including the Pentagon,
confirmed plans to unplug some of their public Web sites over the
weekend hoping to thwart any Y2K-related mischief by computer
hackers.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials reported that despite fears that Americans
might make a run on prescription drugs in fear of possible Y2K
computer problems, the nation's pharmacies have enough medication
to last well into the new year.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala said
Medicare computers are prepared to pay bills in 2000, and repeated
testing of the nation's medical equipment has turned up no serious
Y2K-related problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our safety system will be in place and, in fact, has been
strengthened'' as the agency and the medical community prepared for
the new year, Shalala said.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, no major telephone problems are expected in the United
States unless _ as on any call-intensive day _ too many people try
to use the system, even if only to pick up the receiver to see if
they get a dial tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a basic network congestion issue that we see every
Mother's Day'' and would not be related to Y2K, said Federal
Communications Commissioner Michael Powell. ``This is Mother's Day
on Viagra.''
</P>
<P>
   For months the nation's largest telephone companies, which have
spent more than $3.6 billion upgrading their systems, have said
their networks are ready for 2000. Less certain, officials said, is
what will happen when calls are placed to overseas numbers.
</P>
<P>
   While some computer-related glitches are expected domestically,
they likely will be not widespread, said John Koskinen, chairman of
the President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very confident there will be no disasters,'' Koskinen
said. His agency will gather information about any computer trouble
in 180 countries and all 50 states and help coordinate the U.S.
government's response.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest challenge continues to be monitoring how the
developing countries of the world do,'' Koskinen said, referring to
Asian, African and South American countries.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned that hackers might tamper with Web sites or plant
viruses that would be triggered by a computer's rollover to 2000,
some government agencies are temporarily shutting down their public
Web sites. Among those pulling the plug are the Air Force, the
Pentagon accounting service, the Department of Agriculture and the
Office of Personnel Management.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within some defense agencies, they have thought the most
prudent action was just to take their sites offline,'' said Adm.
Craig Quigly, a Pentagon spokesman. The public-access Web sites are
separate from secure computer operations affecting national
security.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Defense Department's main Web site _
www.defenselink.mil _ will remain in operation, said Pentagon
spokeswoman Susan Hansen. ``That's how we plan to transit
information to the public during the 2000 rollover,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K problem evolved from a long-standing practice of using
only two digits to represent a year in computer programs and
embedded chips. If not corrected, computers could read ``00'' as
the Year 1900 and interrupt technology-reliant systems like power,
telephones and billing.

   SEATTLE _ After planning for two years to stage one of the
biggest New Year's Eve parties in the nation, Seattle officials
Tuesday canceled their public celebration at the base of the city's
best known landmark, the Space Needle, citing security concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle has been on edge ever since riots broke out at the World
Trade Organization meetings here three weeks ago, and the arrest on
Dec. 14 of an Algerian man, Ahmed Ressam, who was carrying enough
explosives to blow up a building. Ressam, who was stopped at Port
Angeles as he tried to enter Washington State by ferry, had booked
a hotel room for one night near the Space Needle. The authorities
have said they have no evidence that Ressam was planning to blow up
the 605-foot spire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a combination of things,'' said Mayor Paul Schell. ``No
other city has had a bomb delivered to its doorstep, or the kind of
anxiety we've had over the WTO meetings, plus Y2K concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 50,000 people had been expected for the fireworks,
concerts and arts shows on Friday night at the Seattle Center. The
annual fireworks show from the Space Needle will still go on, but
the public will be barred from the 75-acre public area around the
Needle beginning at 6 p.m. on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although we are comfortable that Seattle is not a target, we
cannot assure people that there is no risk,'' Schell said.
</P>
<P>
   Contributing to the fears about security is a missing propane
truck, stolen south of Seattle just before the trade meetings, city
officials said. ``That truck is still out there somewhere,'' said
Vivian Phillips, a spokeswoman for the mayor. ``It's one of the
concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   While other cities that plan to hold New Year's Eve celebrations
are going ahead with their plans, the cancellation of a party that
was billed as the biggest civic celebration in a generation
indicates that perhaps the greatest concern over the year 2000 is
not computer glitches, but a fear of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Seattle's cancellation might embolden terrorists
into intimidating other cities, Mayor Schell said: ``Obviously, we
took into account those who would say we would be giving in to
terrorism. But I'm more concerned about the safety of our
citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Schell has been under heavy criticism for failing to provide
adequate security at the WTO meetings. Some demonstrators broke
windows and looted stores, causing more than $2 million in damage.
More than 600 people were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the mayor said he wanted to leave very little to
chance. ``We know there is funny stuff going on out there,'' he
said. ``The millennium, by its nature, is going to bring out the
kookier fringe.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials in New York, Chicago and Washington, which also are
planning major New Year's Eve parties, were reluctant to criticize
Seattle's move, and said they had no plans to change their
celebrations. But, indirectly, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York
indicated disapproval.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would urge people not to let the psychology of fear infect
the way they act; otherwise we have let the terrorist win without
anybody striking a blow,'' Giuliani said. ``No mayor, no governor,
can offer anyone perfect security. Life involves a level of risk.''
</P>
<P>
   New York is expecting upward of 2 million people for the
celebration in Times Square. More than 8,000 police officers will
be on the streets, and city officials say they have taken
extraordinary security precautions, including bolting down sewer
manholes in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is New York,'' Mayor Giuliani said. ``If you tried to
cancel, probably instead of 2 million people showing up, 4 million
people would show up.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the fears have been stoked by statements from former
intelligence officials. Jim Kallstrom, the former agent of the FBI
who was in charge of the investigation into the crash of TWA flight
800 off Long Island in July 1996, recently urged people not to show
up at the Times Square event.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a terrorism strike, it will be in a large
gathering,'' Kallstrom said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, city and federal officials are proceeding with
plans for the millennium celebration to be held at the Lincoln
Memorial. The evening's festivities, at which the singer and actor
Will Smith will be the host, will culminate in a midnight fireworks
display set off by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has assisted Washington officials throughout the
planning for the New Year's Eve party, a spokeswoman for the
mayor's office said. And members of the National Guard will
supplement the 3,500 police officers patrolling the streets on
Friday night, said Kevin Morison, a spokesman for the Metropolitan
Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, guests invited from every country in the world have
started to arrive for the city's millennial party, a dinner and
fireworks display at McCormick Place, a lakefront convention
center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand what they did in Seattle,'' said Lois
Weisberg, an organizer of the party. ``It's too bad, because we
have a combination of Y2K and terrorist threats making everyone
cautious. It really casts a pall over everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas, which is expecting about 250,000 out-of-town visitors
this weekend, has also stepped up security, although none of the
major outdoor celebrations has been curtailed, city officials said.

 SEATTLE: officials said.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   About 3.5 miles of the Las Vegas Strip, fronting most of the
major casinos, will be closed to vehicle traffic on New Year's Eve,
and more than 800 police officers will be on patrol.
</P>
<P>
   While hotel owners had once expected more than half a million
visitors and fully booked hotels, they now say up to 20 percent of
the city's 120,444 hotel rooms will be empty on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FBI has informed us, as late as this morning, that they
have no evidence of a credible terrorism threat against Las
Vegas,'' said Richelle Thomson, a spokeswoman for the Las Vegas
Convention and Visitors Authority.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, while some people complained about being shut out of
a long-planned millennial party, most public officials said they
were relieved that the celebration was canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been worried about the Armageddon people, and this
terrorism issue was just one more thing,'' said Ron Sims, the
executive for King County, which includes Seattle. ``We have been
immune from terrorists for a long time. But sooner or later it
catches up with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Sims had urged Mayor Schell to cancel the party. ``It just
didn't feel right,'' Sims said. ``We've seen enough signs that
there could be trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Schell said that while he had no evidence that Ressam, who is
being held without bail at a federal detention center here, planned
to strike in Seattle, the bomb-making material found in Ressam's
car indicated a threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is he had a room reservation in Seattle, and the
car was going to be returned to the airport,'' said Schell. ``You
can draw an inference from that that a bomb was intended for
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the harshest critics of Schell during the W.T.O. protests
were members of the Seattle City Council. On Tuesday, most council
members backed the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are unusual times, with unusual circumstances'' said Sue
Donaldson, the council president. ``It seems unwise to create a
crowd of 50,000 in this uncertain situation.''

DOW CLIMBS TO A RECORD AS NASDAQ FAILS IN RUN AT 4,000
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Dow Jones industrial average climbed to a record
Tuesday, but high-flying technology shares suffered a late-day
sell-off, and the Nasdaq composite index closed lower.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq, which traded above the 4,000 level for most of the
session, gave up a 47-point gain and closed down 3.27 points, or
0.1 percent, to 3,972.11. It was the third session in a row that
the Nasdaq had broken 4,000 during the day, only to fall back.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said that under normal circumstances the Nasdaq's
setbacks would be disappointing and that 4,000 could be construed
as a barrier the index is unable to penetrate. But they added that
price swings were essentially irrelevant at this time of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reversal at the end of the day was a little disappointing,
but I am reluctant to call any of the price action we are seeing
right now significant,'' said Jonathan Olesky, head of block
trading at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Nasdaq had a late-day reversal with all the assorted
players in the market, that would be a bad pattern, and you would
expect to see a sloppy opening the next day,'' he said. ``But right
now about half of the regular players are around, and stocks are
more volatile than they would be in a normal trading period.''
</P>
<P>
   About 664 million shares exchanged hands on the New York Stock
Exchange Tuesday, nearly 30 percent less than the three-month daily
average. Volume on the Nasdaq stock market remained fairly brisk,
with 1.2 billion shares traded.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts expect a big sell-off in technology shares early
next year, as investors with the insight or good fortune to have
money tied up in some of 1999's best-performing stocks take profits
that they will not have to pay capital gains taxes on until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Some money may have shifted out of those stocks and into
cyclical stocks Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Names like Alcoa, United Technologies and Minnesota Mining and
Manufacturing were among the Dow's best performers.
</P>
<P>
   Led by those stocks, the Dow closed at 11,476.71, up 85.63, or
0.8 percent. It was the second record for the blue-chip index in
the last three sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a turn toward cyclicals, and it is going to come at
the expense of the technology and Internet sectors,'' said Richard
E. Cripps, chief market strategist at Legg Mason in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is going to be a correction in technology names,'' he
added. ``The question is the magnitude of that correction. I think
it will be on the order of 20 percent, and I think it will start
sometime in January.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index barely budged,
rising 0.56 point, to 1,457.66. But the Russell 2000 index of
smaller company stocks continued its strong advance, rising 4.02
points, or 0.8 percent, to 488.48. The index is now within three
points of the record 491.41 set on April 21, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Dow components, Alcoa, the best-performing issue in
the index this year, gained 2 7/16, to 80{. United Technologies
rose 3 3/16, to 64 3/16. And 3M closed at 96~, up 3[.
</P>
<P>
   Technology and Internet shares that posted big gains on Monday
reversed course Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   JDS Uniphase fell 15}, to 319{. Qualcomm, the best performer in
the S&AMP; P 500 this year, fell 43 points in the last half-hour of
trading, recovered somewhat and closed at 503, down 10 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   Other big technology issues were also weaker.
</P>
<P>
   Intel dropped 2 1/16, to 83. Microsoft fell 1|, to 117{. And
America Online dipped 1 11/16, to 77.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Jostens, the nation's biggest maker of yearbooks and
class rings, rose 5 5/16, to 24\, after Investcorp said it would
buy the company for $25.25 a share in cash.
</P>
<P>
   And Internet Gold, one the largest Internet service providers in
Israel, soared 13~, to 28[, after it said it would enter a joint
venture with Microsoft to run a Web site under Microsoft's MSN
brand name.

 &HT;    Statement issued on Y2K hacker mischief
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving to (a) General news and (f) Financial categories.)
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Computer experts warned Tuesday that hackers may be
planning an attack that would clog selected high-speed lines by
enlisting the help of hundreds _ or thousands _ of unsuspecting
users of new Apple computers.
</P>
<P>
   Tipped off by Georgia Tech professor John Copeland, the Computer
Emergency Response Team Coordination Center in Pittsburgh has
issued an alert to managers of corporate and government web sites
that someone in the ``intruder community'' means to flood their
lines with data. The result could be a costly nuisance, a public
relations embarrassment or, perhaps, something worse.
</P>
<P>
   After the CERT advisory, Apple offered a solution via the
Internet, saying that MacIntosh owners need not worry if they
download the ``open transport update'' from the Internet
(http://asu.info.apple.com/swupdates.nsf/artnum/n11559). Apple said
in a statement, ``Apple is aware of the CERT advisory and has taken
steps to address it.''
</P>
<P>
   The story started when Copeland noticed someone ``probing'' his
home computer with odd bursts of data. First, he was puzzled, then
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Copeland is not the average Macintosh user, not even an average
techie. A professor of electrical engineering at Tech, he is a
veteran of Bell Labs and director of a center that studies
high-speed data transmission.
</P>
<P>
   He traced the probes. He tracked several back toward their
sources, using techniques that show the paths they took by listing
the equipment that passed them along.
</P>
<P>
   The tracks led first to Virginia, then to New York City before
jumping across the Atlantic. They ended in the United Arab Emirates
and Saudi Arabia. Another came from Italy, another from Duke
University, but Copeland is convinced that the scan started in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, hackers are adept at disguising their locations. Even
the results produced in the other tracking efforts may be false
sources, but Copeland said he believes the Middle East addresses
are not ``spoofed,'' or adulterated.
</P>
<P>
   He discounts the notion that repeated scans of his computer
could be the work of just another researcher. ``Because the things
coming out of this part of the world are not coming from network
scientists working for the good of mankind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then something else clicked for him. The latest operating system
from Apple _ Macintosh OS 9 _ has a feature that could be misused.
</P>
<P>
   A Mac running OS 9 can be used as a ``data amplifier.'' An OS 9
machine will respond to a certain kind of data packet or message
that triggers it to send a much larger, 1.5 megabit, packet of its
own to wherever it is told to send it.
</P>
<P>
   Copeland realized that a hacker who contacted a large number of
OS 9 machines connected to the Internet could tell them all to send
huge packets of data to one address, flooding its lines and
rendering them useless.
</P>
<P>
   The target could be a government agency, a news organization, or
a global company. Once the target's lines are overloaded, they are
blocked until either the offending Macs are turned off or the
target's Internet address is changed _ which can take several days.
</P>
<P>
   Copeland mentally made the connection between this oddity in the
OS 9 system and the probing of his own computer. To test his
theory, Copeland duplicated the technique. He made ``slaves'' of
three other Macs, and caused them to send packets of data to an
address.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a scary thing,'' he said. ``Right now, I have software
that could shut down any Internet site.''
</P>
<P>
   He contacted CERT, Apple and the National Infrastructure
Protection Center at the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI does not comment on active cases, and the bureau has no
jurisdiction outside the United States, said spokeswoman Debbie
Weierman. ``What we would do is contact the law enforcement
officials, the government entities of the country involved and
elicit their help.''
</P>
<P>
   Will hackers use the technique to make mischief with web sites
in the United States? No one knows.
</P>
<P>
   However, a successful attack could be aggravating and costly,
virtually shutting down victims' web access, said Shawn Hernan,
vulnerability handling team leader at CERT. ``This is not
Net-threatening, but it probably is a threat to some individual
(web) sites. You may have no recourse other than to go find those
computers that are bombarding you and get them to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   And doing that would be time-consuming at best because the
owners of those computers won't know their machines are the
culprits.
</P>
<P>
   Tempering that warning is uncertainty about the intentions of
the hackers. They could _ at least conceivably _ be playing or
testing. If they are maliciously minded, their plan does seems to
depend on a very small number of vulnerable Macintosh computers.
Moreover, some networks have engineered limits on how much data
computers can transmit.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the conspiracy _ if that is what it is _ would be
utterly squashed if vulnerable Macs were simply turned off or
Apple's software fix downloaded.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the danger is real, since attackers need only enlist a
relatively few unwitting ``slaves'' to do some damage, said
Copeland.
</P>
<P>
   Just 40 computers manipulated by a hacker could produce enough
data to swamp a DS-3 line, a broadband ``pipe'' that can carry
about 45 megabits of data into an organization's network, he said.
``It's like the rays from a spyglass. You could focus a few Macs on
the connection and knock out the e-mail and web connections to,
say, the (Atlanta-based) Centers for Disease Control.''
</P>
<P>
   A hacker intent on mischief would need only expertise, a
computer, the appropriate software and a connection to the global
Internet, Copeland said. ``You don't have to buy 40 computers, and
you don't have to break into 40 computers. The reason we haven't
seen any attempts thus far is that I think the people who are doing
this are saving it for New Year's Eve.''
</P>
<P>
   Whoever might be planning the attack would hope to remain
anonymous, since the flood of data would come from many computers
on which the hackers would hope to leave no cyber-fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   And the hacker could do it from anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Today's global Internet _ and the millions of computers
connected to it _ permits long-distance contact and often
surveillance as well. A hacker with the right software can probe a
computer for clues about its vulnerability to intrusion or
manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   Hackers steal information, they alter web sites. They crash
computers or jam networks. They do it for fun, for profit or to
make a political statement. They have done it often enough _ and
the stakes have grown so high _ that an industry of computer
security has grown up to protect the machines and the networks.
</P>
<P>
   But in this case, hackers seem uninterested in information _
other than the whereabouts of vulnerable computers to be used in
clogging other lines.
</P>
<P>
   So traditional defenses, the ``firewalls'' commonly used to
surround corporate and governmental networks, are relatively
useless. First, the hackers' are aiming at Macs, commonly found in
homes. And a firewalls will not afford protection if the attack
comes if the flood of data chokes the lines before they get to the
firewall itself.
</P>
<P>
   For hackers, the strategy is not new. What is new is Macintosh
OS 9.
</P>
<P>
   So the number of computers that could be exploited remains
relatively small. Apple represents something less than 10 percent
of the desktop machines sold, and only a minority of installed
machines are likely to be running OS 9, which only came out this
fall. Moreover, the machines most susceptible to the hackers would
have cable modem or DSL connections and that too, represents only a
small minority of users.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a standard dial-up modem, which links the user to the Net
only while he or she is actively web-surfing, the connection of DSL
or cable modem is always on. A talented scanner can gather
information at his or her convenience, and then go back to
manipulate the machine later.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat similar attacks variously called ``denial of service,''
``flooding,'' or a ``Smurf attack,'' have been seen _ and often
defeated _ by those who run Internet networks. There are various
defenses. For example, engineers can limit the rate of data spewed
by any one computer served by a high-speed provider like a cable or
telephone company.
</P>
<P>
   One network with that protection is Cox Communications, one the
nation's largest providers of high-speed access, which has faced a
number of similar attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't share the same degree of concern that (Copeland)
does,'' said Alex Best, senior vice president for engineering at
Cox Communications. ``But having said all that, I'll keep my
fingers crossed on New Year's Eve, for a lot of reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Hernan said CERT views that protection as little help
to the intended victims. ``Limiting traffic internally is only an
internal solution.''

 &HT;    Statement issued on Y2K hacker mischief
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving to (a) General news and (f) Financial categories.)
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Computer experts warned Tuesday that hackers may be
planning an attack that would clog selected high-speed lines by
enlisting the help of hundreds _ or thousands _ of unsuspecting
users of new Apple computers.
</P>
<P>
   Tipped off by Georgia Tech professor John Copeland, the Computer
Emergency Response Team Coordination Center in Pittsburgh has
issued an alert to managers of corporate and government web sites
that someone in the ``intruder community'' means to flood their
lines with data. The result could be a costly nuisance, a public
relations embarrassment or, perhaps, something worse.
</P>
<P>
   After the CERT advisory, Apple offered a solution via the
Internet, saying that MacIntosh owners need not worry if they
download the ``open transport update'' from the Internet
(http://asu.info.apple.com/swupdates.nsf/artnum/n11559). Apple said
in a statement, ``Apple is aware of the CERT advisory and has taken
steps to address it.''
</P>
<P>
   The story started when Copeland noticed someone ``probing'' his
home computer with odd bursts of data. First, he was puzzled, then
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Copeland is not the average Macintosh user, not even an average
techie. A professor of electrical engineering at Tech, he is a
veteran of Bell Labs and director of a center that studies
high-speed data transmission.
</P>
<P>
   He traced the probes. He tracked several back toward their
sources, using techniques that show the paths they took by listing
the equipment that passed them along.
</P>
<P>
   The tracks led first to Virginia, then to New York City before
jumping across the Atlantic. They ended in the United Arab Emirates
and Saudi Arabia. Another came from Italy, another from Duke
University, but Copeland is convinced that the scan started in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, hackers are adept at disguising their locations. Even
the results produced in the other tracking efforts may be false
sources, but Copeland said he believes the Middle East addresses
are not ``spoofed,'' or adulterated.
</P>
<P>
   He discounts the notion that repeated scans of his computer
could be the work of just another researcher. ``Because the things
coming out of this part of the world are not coming from network
scientists working for the good of mankind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then something else clicked for him. The latest operating system
from Apple _ Macintosh OS 9 _ has a feature that could be misused.
</P>
<P>
   A Mac running OS 9 can be used as a ``data amplifier.'' An OS 9
machine will respond to a certain kind of data packet or message
that triggers it to send a much larger, 1.5 megabit, packet of its
own to wherever it is told to send it.
</P>
<P>
   Copeland realized that a hacker who contacted a large number of
OS 9 machines connected to the Internet could tell them all to send
huge packets of data to one address, flooding its lines and
rendering them useless.
</P>
<P>
   The target could be a government agency, a news organization, or
a global company. Once the target's lines are overloaded, they are
blocked until either the offending Macs are turned off or the
target's Internet address is changed _ which can take several days.
</P>
<P>
   Copeland mentally made the connection between this oddity in the
OS 9 system and the probing of his own computer. To test his
theory, Copeland duplicated the technique. He made ``slaves'' of
three other Macs, and caused them to send packets of data to an
address.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a scary thing,'' he said. ``Right now, I have software
that could shut down any Internet site.''
</P>
<P>
   He contacted CERT, Apple and the National Infrastructure
Protection Center at the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI does not comment on active cases, and the bureau has no
jurisdiction outside the United States, said spokeswoman Debbie
Weierman. ``What we would do is contact the law enforcement
officials, the government entities of the country involved and
elicit their help.''
</P>
<P>
   Will hackers use the technique to make mischief with websites
in the United States? No one knows.
</P>
<P>
   However, a successful attack could be aggravating and costly,
virtually shutting down victims' web access, said Shawn Hernan,
vulnerability handling team leader at CERT. ``This is not
Net-threatening, but it probably is a threat to some individual
(web) sites. You may have no recourse other than to go find those
computers that are bombarding you and get them to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   And doing that would be time-consuming at best because the
owners of those computers won't know their machines are the
culprits.
</P>
<P>
   Tempering that warning is uncertainty about the intentions of
the hackers. They could _ at least conceivably _ be playing or
testing. If they are maliciously minded, their plan does seems to
depend on a very small number of vulnerable Macintosh computers.
Moreover, some networks have engineered limits on how much data
computers can transmit.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the conspiracy _ if that is what it is _ would be
utterly squashed if vulnerable Macs were simply turned off or
Apple's software fix downloaded.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the danger is real, since attackers need only enlist a
relatively few unwitting ``slaves'' to do some damage, said
Copeland.
</P>
<P>
   Just 40 computers manipulated by a hacker could produce enough
data to swamp a DS-3 line, a broadband ``pipe'' that can carry
about 45 megabits of data into an organization's network, he said.
``It's like the rays from a spyglass. You could focus a few Macs on
the connection and knock out the e-mail and web connections to,
say, the (Atlanta-based) Centers for Disease Control.''
</P>
<P>
   A hacker intent on mischief would need only expertise, a
computer, the appropriate software and a connection to the global
Internet, Copeland said. ``You don't have to buy 40 computers, and
you don't have to break into 40 computers. The reason we haven't
seen any attempts thus far is that I think the people who are doing
this are saving it for New Year's Eve.''
</P>
<P>
   Whoever might be planning the attack would hope to remain
anonymous, since the flood of data would come from many computers
on which the hackers would hope to leave no cyber-fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   And the hacker could do it from anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Today's global Internet _ and the millions of computers
connected to it _ permits long-distance contact and often
surveillance as well. A hacker with the right software can probe a
computer for clues about its vulnerability to intrusion or
manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   Hackers steal information, they alter web sites. They crash
computers or jam networks. They do it for fun, for profit or to
make a political statement. They have done it often enough _ and
the stakes have grown so high _ that an industry of computer
security has grown up to protect the machines and the networks.
</P>
<P>
   But in this case, hackers seem uninterested in information _
other than the whereabouts of vulnerable computers to be used in
clogging other lines.
</P>
<P>
   So traditional defenses, the ``firewalls'' commonly used to
surround corporate and governmental networks, are relatively
useless. First, the hackers' are aiming at Macs, commonly found in
homes. And a firewalls will not afford protection if the attack
comes if the flood of data chokes the lines before they get to the
firewall itself.
</P>
<P>
   For hackers, the strategy is not new. What is new is Macintosh
OS 9.
</P>
<P>
   So the number of computers that could be exploited remains
relatively small. Apple represents something less than 10 percent
of the desktop machines sold, and only a minority of installed
machines are likely to be running OS 9, which only came out this
fall. Moreover, the machines most susceptible to the hackers would
have cable modem or DSL connections and that too, represents only a
small minority of users.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a standard dial-up modem, which links the user to the Net
only while he or she is actively web-surfing, the connection of DSL
or cable modem is always on. A talented scanner can gather
information at his or her convenience, and then go back to
manipulate the machine later.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat similar attacks variously called ``denial of service,''
``flooding,'' or a ``Smurf attack,'' have been seen _ and often
defeated _ by those who run Internet networks. There are various
defenses. For example, engineers can limit the rate of data spewed
by any one computer served by a high-speed provider like a cable or
telephone company.
</P>

fingers crossed on New Year's Eve, for a lot of reasons.''

<P>
   PARIS _ Still struggling to pick itself up after being pounded
by a fierce storm on Sunday, France was hit with another, equally
fierce storm overnight that killed 22 people, raising the death
toll since Christmas to at least 66, officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Storms have left more than 100 people dead in Western Europe in
the last four days, but France has been hit the hardest. This
latest storm sent gale-force winds tearing through the southern
half of the country Monday night and Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Television crews that reported Paris and other northern areas
struggling under fallen trees and collapsed roofs over the weekend
now recorded similar scenes in villages stretching from Bordeaux to
the Riviera. In southwestern coastal areas like La Rochelle, luxury
yachts, once tied up in the harbors, were flung up on shore.
</P>
<P>
   The new storm _ again with winds reaching at times up to 125 mph
_ heaped new trouble on emergency repair crews already working
around the clock to restore services knocked out by Sunday's storm.
It toppled electric-line pylons, turned over trucks, flattened
trees like matchsticks and collapsed thousands of roofs.
</P>
<P>
   Again most of the deaths were caused by falling debris. But in
Calvados, a firefighter died trying to rescue flood victims. Swept
into a river by flood waters, he was rescued by a helicopter but
fell as he was lifted away. In L'Indre, a man died after he and his
son fell from a boat. The son was rescued, but the father was not
found.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they did not expect significant damage to
agriculture. But rail and air service, most of which was at least
briefly back in operation on Monday afternoon, was once again
plunged into chaos. Air France canceled 10 percent of its domestic
flights Tuesday, and on many train routes only one out of three
scheduled trains ran.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday afternoon, the national electricity company said some
3.5 million households were without electricity, and it conceded
that it could take days before power was restored through out the
country.
</P>
<P>
   It also announced that it was asking France's neighbors _
Germany, Spain and Britain _ to lend cables, pylons and other
supplies to speed the repair work.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities also announced that some 400,000 households had
no telephone service and that dozens of roads had to be closed
because of fallen branches and mudslides.
</P>
<P>
   ``The damage is considerable,'' said Transportation Minister
Jean-Claude Gayssot. ``Road, rail and air routes are affected. We
really are in great difficulty.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The high winds also stirred up high waves on the Atlantic coast
and pushed even more oil onto a 250-mile stretch of the Brittany
coast where an oil tanker broke up in rough seas more than two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, who on Monday cut short his
vacation to Egypt, toured the area Tuesday and said he would meet
soon with executives of TotalFina, the oil company that had
chartered the tanker, to convince them that they had a moral
obligation to help pay for the cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that they see that their obligation goes beyond a
question of law,'' Jospin said.
</P>
<P>
   The first storm, which began before dawn on Sunday, left a path
of destruction across Europe. Seventeen people died in Germany and
13 in Switzerland in weather-related incidents. A sixth person died
in northern Spain Tuesday after her boat capsized in heavy winds.
Britain, too, was hit with flooding.
</P>
<P>
   But France bore the brunt of the winter onslaught, with Paris
buffeted by record winds, rising to 95 mph. The winds left the city
littered with broken glass, twisted sheets of roofing and smashed
flowerpots. Many historic buildings, including Notre-Dame
Cathedral, Sainte-Chapelle and the palace at Versailles, were also
damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday the cleanup continued. But the roofers union announced
that it needed the help from the government and the army to deal
with all the damage.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the union, Patrick Debarle, said the roofers
needed supplies and extra workers to make sure that emergency
repairs were put in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not have the capacity to respond to the millions of
requests we are getting, because we don't have enough materials or
workers,'' Debarle said. ``There isn't a nail, a beam or a sheet of
plastic that hasn't already been snapped up in the Paris region.''
</P>
<P>
   The Banque Nationale de Paris announced that it had set aside
about $220 million to create a special fund for interest-free loans
to its customers who were victims of the storm.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor of Paris, Jean Tiberi, promised that urgent repair
work would be done quickly and predicted that millennium parties in
the city, expected to draw millions of revelers, would not be
disrupted.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 giant Ferris wheels set up for New Year's celebrations
appear to have been unaffected by the storms. Organizers of the
event said the brightly lit wheels, placed down the middle of the
Champs-Elysees to simulate the movement into the next millennium,
would begin turning at midnight Friday as expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need to take any special precautions,'' said Francois
Belfort, who is running the event. ``We took them before the
storm.''
</P>
<P>
   Snow has also been falling since the weekend in eastern France
and large parts of Central and Eastern Europe, disrupting traffic.
Todd Miner, a meteorologist at Penn State University, said that
Sunday's storm, in terms of wind strength and damage inflicted, was
a ``one-in-50-year event,'' but that its quick succession by an
equally powerful storm in nearly the same area could be expected
only ``once in a hundred'' years.
</P>
<P>
   The national weather service here said that the worst had passed
and that the weather should improve in the next few days.

TURF WARS JEOPARDIZE ORGAN TRANSPLANT POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa, Neb., N.Y., Ore., Va. ) (sw) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Like a baseball manager who recruits a
winning pitcher, administrators at the Iowa Methodist Medical
Center gave themselves a hearty pat on the back when Dr. Maureen
Martin signed onto their staff. A nationally recognized liver
transplant surgeon, Dr. Martin, 49, possesses the self-confident
charm and star power that hospital marketing people love.
</P>
<P>
   She had worked with Dr. Thomas E. Starzl, who founded the field
and turned the University of Pittsburgh into a magnet for liver
transplants, and went on to build her own program at the University
of Iowa, 120 miles from here in Iowa City. Two years ago, when the
university rejected her plans for satellite centers around the
state, Iowa Methodist was only too happy to start its own liver
transplant center, with Dr. Martin as chief.
</P>
<P>
   What Iowa Methodist did not anticipate, however, was the nasty
turf war that would ensue. The chief liver surgeon at the
University of Nebraska, which draws patients from neighboring Iowa,
has questioned whether the region needs another transplant program
and has accused Dr. Martin of ``self-serving baloney.'' When Iowa
Methodist sought, and received, state approval for its plans, the
opposition from the University of Iowa was so fierce that Dr.
Martin no longer speaks to her former partner there.
</P>
<P>
   Such is life in the liver wars. At a time when human organs,
particularly livers, are in short supply, the skirmish in Iowa
provides a window into a national feud over the Clinton
administration's plan to require that donated hearts, lungs,
livers, kidneys and pancreases go to the sickest patients first,
rather than those who live closest to the organ donors. The debate
polarized Congress at the end of its last session and is expected
to resume when the lawmakers return in January.
</P>
<P>
   People on both sides of the debate, as well as experts inside
and outside the transplant field, say it is not just about saving
patients' lives.
</P>
<P>
   The fight, they say, is about which transplant centers _ not
which patients _will get the scarce organs, and the profits and
prestige that go with them. It is being driven by surgeons whose
careers and egos depend on the success and size of the transplant
programs they run.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a power struggle,'' complained Dr. Martin, who will
leave Iowa in January for Beth Israel Deaconness Medical Center in
Boston, to replace a surgeon who took his entire liver transplant
team _ 28 people _ and 2,000 patients to a competing hospital, the
Lahey Clinic. ``It's a tug of war, and the patients are the rope.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration's proposed rule would give Dr. Donna Shalala,
the secretary of health and human services, broad authority over
organ allocation policy. Shalala has ordered the United Network for
Organ Sharing, the nonprofit agency that runs the distribution
network, to devise a new system that meets her sickest-first
criteria and would allow for broad sharing of organs across state
lines. Although the details have not been worked out, the mere idea
of change has split liver centers into roughly two camps.
</P>
<P>
   And because nearly every liver surgeon in the nation has either
trained under Starzl or trained under someone who has, the dispute
is at its core a family feud, although the patriarch from
Pittsburgh, now semiretired, has maintained a conspicuous silence
throughout.
</P>
<P>
   On one side are seven very large programs, led by Pittsburgh's,
which tend to treat very sick patients and would presumably benefit
from rules that put the sickest first. These centers support
Shalala. On the other is the Patients Access to Transplantation
Coalition, a collection of several dozen mostly midsize hospitals
like the University of Iowa that have thrived under the current
system, in which geography, as opposed to medical urgency, dictates
the flow of organs. These centers want to maintain the status quo,
and say that Shalala has no right to intervene in medical
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides are busy lobbying Congress, where members are lining
up not by party affiliation but by how they believe the plan may
affect doctors in their states.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the politics of local interest, which are partially
economic but also a question of prestige and status and
competitiveness among surgeons and institutions,'' said Bruce
Vladek, a health policy analyst at Mount Sinai Medical Center in
Manhattan, which is in the Pittsburgh camp. ``There is something to
me that is tawdry about very highly compensated, high-prestige
professionals engaged in such a naked turf fight with the interests
of patients so far down in the pecking order of what gets worried
about or paid attention to.''
</P>
<P>
   Vladek is not the only one who is disgusted. Dr. Lawrence G.
Hunsicker, the kidney specialist at the University of Iowa to whom
Dr. Martin no longer speaks, accuses his fellow transplant
professionals of ``squabbling like spoiled children.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Byers W. Shaw Jr., the Nebraska surgeon who raised questions
about Iowa Methodist's program, says friendships with doctors he
once respected have gone sour. ``This is about our failure as a
profession to solve our own problems,'' he said. ``The arrogance
that I have heard from some of my colleagues is unimaginable.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet as the debate drags on, and the organ shortage grows more
acute, more and more hospitals are trying to jump into the
transplant business, creating regional feuds similar to the one
that erupted in Iowa. With the transplant field maturing, the
academic medical centers that dominated the landscape are now
facing competition from community-based hospitals like Iowa
Methodist. Often, there is little they can do.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When a hospital in Norfolk, Va., sought permission to start a
liver program this year, the Medical College of Virginia in
Richmond objected. When heart and pancreas transplant centers
opened in Portland, Ore., the Oregon Health Sciences University
raised a fuss. In New York, Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx
and Westchester County Medical Center received state permission in
November to begin doing heart transplants, provoking private
grumbling, Vladek said, from others in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, the number of liver transplant programs has leaped
from 70 in 1988 to 125 in 1998, according to the United Network for
Organ Sharing. ``Most people would say there are certainly more
programs than are warranted,'' said Roger W. Evans, a health policy
analyst who has advised the government on transplant matters.
</P>
<P>
   Yet building a transplant program, which requires not only
highly trained surgeons but also a highly trained staff to support
them, is not easy, as Dr. Martin has found. Despite its state
approval, Iowa Methodist has not begun offering liver transplants
because it has not met the organ-sharing network's requirement that
a hepatologist, a nonsurgical liver specialist, be on staff. A
hepatologist has been recruited and will join the hospital in June,
officials there say. But now that Dr. Martin is leaving, they will
also have to find a liver surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-talking and blunt, with blue-rimmed oval glasses and a
dime-sized diamond on her ring finger, Dr. Martin is one of the
very few women in her field. She chose the liver as her specialty,
she says, because ``it requires guts to operate on.''
</P>
<P>
   The remark is telling, reflecting the legacy of Starzl, who is
widely considered brilliant, irascible and bold. He declined to be
interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He feels it's beneath him'' to get involved in the dispute,
explained Dr. John Fung, who now runs the Pittsburgh transplant
program, adding that the dispute had ``genuinely hurt'' Starzl.
``It's like a parent giving birth to Abel and Cain.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Martin, who describes Starzl as ``a Rasputin'' yet keeps his
picture and a signed copy of his book in her office, went to work
for him in 1989, when Pittsburgh dominated the field. Of 2,201
liver transplants in the United States that year, Pittsburgh
surgeons performed 441. By the time Dr. Martin left for the
University of Iowa three years later, new liver transplant centers,
many run by Pittsburgh-trained surgeons, were popping up, changing
the economics of the business.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh performed just 160 liver transplants last year,
according to the organ-sharing network. The price of a transplant
has been estimated at $244,600, said Evans, the health policy
analyst, although health-plan reimbursements may be much lower. So
for a big center like Pittsburgh, the drop-off in business is a
significant loss.
</P>
<P>
   For small to medium-sized hospitals like Iowa Methodist, the
financial picture is different. The hospital does not plan to get
rich doing transplants; an economic analysis found it would
actually lose $1 million a year for the first three years, although
those losses would be significantly offset by other liver disease
patients the center would bring in. By the third year, the analysis
found, the entire liver program would turn a profit of $94,433.
</P>
<P>
   But money was not the only consideration. Transplant centers
project a cutting-edge image and are important for attracting
doctors and patients. And half of all Iowans needing liver
transplants go out of state. ``There is a demand in this state that
is not being met,'' said Jim Skogsbergh, the hospital's chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   As for Dr. Martin, she says her motivation is simple: treating
patients close to home. ``If you can supply a service to a
community that is cost-effective, with the same results, why send
these people miles away?''
</P>
<P>
   But across the state in Iowa City, Hunsicker of the University
of Iowa questions whether results would really be the same. Medical
research shows patients fare best in centers that perform at least
20 transplants a year, he said, adding that the number of
transplants in Iowa is now limited by the number of usable donated
organs, about 40 a year. ``So if we had two programs,'' he said,
``and we split evenly, then we would both be at the very lowest end
of the numbers necessary to maintain competence.''
</P>
<P>
   So doctors and researchers are looking for a way out of the
organ crunch. Several hospitals, including the University of
Iowa's, are experimenting with ``living donor'' transplants, which
involve using part of a healthy adult's liver. (The liver has a
remarkable capacity to regenerate.) And several companies are
trying to develop pig livers for transplant use. Dr. Martin says
Iowa Methodist is positioning itself to take advantage of these
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   That the hospital is laying its plans against the backdrop of
the Clinton administration's proposed changes does not seem to faze
her, perhaps because the national dispute shows no signs of a quick
resolution. On Dec. 17, President Clinton signed a bill that in
theory could put the new rule into effect by mid-March. But that is
unlikely, because Congress plans to reopen the issue as part of a
bill reauthorizing the National Organ Transplant Act, the 1984 law
establishing the organ donor network. The House is considering
legislation to revoke Shalala's authority.
</P>
<P>
   Now Dr. Martin is readying herself for her next battleground:
Boston. She is eager to get back in the operating room, she said,
and in typical take-no-prisoners fashion, she laid out plans to
wrest back some business from Dr. Roger Jenkins, the surgeon who
left Beth Israel Deaconness for the Lahey Clinic. Already, Dr.
Martin said, she has entered into a partnership with a hepatologist
who refers some business to Jenkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to be,'' she predicted, ``an interesting year.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For George W. Bush, a typical day on the campaign trail used to
involve a $1,000-a-head fund-raiser or two, several skin-chafing
marathons of hand shaking and a few rote recitations of his
maxim-laden stump speech.
</P>
<P>
   But in New Hampshire over the next several weeks, Bush plans to
change all that. He will stage more of the free-wheeling,
question-and-answer sessions that have been the strength and staple
of Sen. John McCain of Arizona, his chief rival for the Republican
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's television commercials will also take on a new look and
feel. In addition to the carefully posed, painstakingly produced
spots that the Bush campaign has already put on the air, New
Hampshire voters will see advertisements that bear the legend
``campaign update'' and show uninterrupted, straightforward
snippets of Bush engaging the state's voters.
</P>
<P>
   To aides like Bush's chief media adviser, Mark McKinnon, these
newsreel-like, miniature documentaries are intended to affirm
``just how hard the governor is working to earn every vote in New
Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   But both of these adjustments seem like unmistakable
acknowledgments of the deep trouble Bush finds himself facing in
New Hampshire with the presidential primary just a month away.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush remains the overwhelming favorite to win the
Republican nomination with tens of millions of dollars just waiting
to be spent, he has failed to repel the pesky challenge posed by
McCain, whose campaign is short on money but long on spirit. In
fact, even Bush acknowledges that McCain is now the front-runner in
New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   While the moves by the Bush campaign clearly reflect McCain's
surge in the New Hampshire polls, they also address a wider
perception of the Texas governor as a heavily scripted candidate
who became the Republican front-runner by dint of his name and a
collective Republican hunch but who has yet to subject himself to
sustained, exacting scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've agreed upon steps that we're putting into place,
mid-course corrections,'' said Karl Rove, Bush's chief strategist,
speaking in particular of New Hampshire, where some members of the
Bush team recently complained publicly about the paucity and
formality of Bush's appearances.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the period since he officially kicked off his
campaign in June, Bush was busy canvassing the whole country,
raising an unprecedented amount of money and giving himself ample
family time and rest. Rare was the weekend when he scheduled a
campaign appearance outside of Texas; a typical week put him on the
road for no more than three and a half days.
</P>
<P>
   But with only about a month to go before the Iowa caucus and New
Hampshire primary jump-start a frenzied nominating process, that,
too, is about to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be wall-to-wall in January,'' said Ari Fleischer, a
campaign spokesman. ``And it'll be geographically confined to the
following states: Iowa, Iowa, Iowa and Iowa. New Hampshire, New
Hampshire, New Hampshire and New Hampshire. And South Carolina,
South Carolina and South Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say there is anything even remotely resembling a
sense of panic among those around Bush, whose position remains the
envy of his five Republican opponents.
</P>
<P>
   In national polls, he continues to trump McCain by dizzying
double-digit margins of more than 40 percentage points. Outside of
Arizona, McCain's home state, and New Hampshire, which McCain could
claim as a second residence at this point, Bush seems to have a
lead in every state with an early contest.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, his campaign's estimated haul of more than $65
million in contributions means that Bush has the financial
resources to advertise heavily anywhere his lead seems to be
slipping. McCain's tally is less than a third of that sum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubt that Governor Bush will be the nominee of this
party,'' said Ralph Reed, one of his advisers, in a recent
interview. ``None.''
</P>
<P>
   Rove added that Bush has an insurance policy that most
candidates do not: an army of about 4,000 workers, mostly
volunteers, including campaign chairmen and chairwomen not just in
many states, but also in many counties, cities and towns.
</P>
<P>
   ``What that means is that when the little local Republican club
has its meeting, there's a Bush surrogate there, there's Bush
material being distributed,'' Rove explained. ``We have an
organization everywhere, and we can deliver a message everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the adjustments that Bush's campaign is making suggest an
awareness that a few mistakes have been made and a few problems
created, that the once-magical spell enveloping his candidacy has
been broken and that any residual glimmer of overconfidence could
shrink the long odds against an upset victory by McCain.
</P>
<P>
   A few recent polls contained some encouraging news for McCain.
The surveys showed that while McCain still trails Bush by large
margins in South Carolina and Michigan, he has collapsed the
distance between him and the front-runner considerably. And in
Iowa, where McCain has devoted virtually no time or energy, he
nonetheless has double-digit support.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder, then, that Bush's advisers said that in both his
public remarks in January and in upcoming commercials, Bush will
more boldly underscore the distinctions between him and McCain,
principally by focusing on two areas, taxes and education, where
Bush and his team feel they have put forward more detailed,
coherent and innovative proposals than McCain has.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's crusade for changes in campaign finance laws has proven
popular with independent voters, but Bush will continue to try to
counter with an effort to persuade Republicans that the McCain plan
is flawed and would give Democrats an unfair advantage in
elections.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Bush's advisers have, over the past few weeks,
begun to acknowledge that Bush may indeed lose New Hampshire. And
they have begun to talk about why that does not matter or why that
would be good for Bush, in that his eventual capture of the
Republican nomination would then seem more like a mettle-proving
triumph and less like an easy coronation.
</P>
<P>
   But the attention they are poised to pay to New Hampshire
indicates that they have by no means ceded the state and that, if
they lose it, they want McCain's victory to be too narrow to give
him any real momentum elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his advisers also seem to see the way they campaign in
New Hampshire over the coming weeks as an opportunity to repudiate
some of the negative appraisals of Bush as an overly programmed and
excessively cautious candidate, a task that political analysts said
could affect how deft a segue Bush is able to make into the general
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest challenge for Governor Bush is justifying the
confidence that numerous Republicans and contributors have placed
in him,'' said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster. ``A great many
people gave him money and lined up behind him before they knew him
that well. He needs to give them some reassurance that their
initial judgment is wise.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Bush's tepid performances in debates earlier this month created
a palpable sense of unease among some Republican officials and
contributed to a gelling image of Bush in the media as a smug
student ill-prepared for the exam he has sauntered into.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it hard to buy the lightweight line, but the Democrats
are repeating that mantra, and it's getting play in the press,''
noted Ed Gillespie, a Republican strategist. ``He needs to be
conscious of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Buchanan, a political scientist at the University of
Texas, said that the success of Bush's candidacy down the road
could hinge on whether journalists and other opinion makers keep
raising questions about Bush's gravity and depth and whether that
creates qualms among other voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's a lead-pipe cinch they will care,''
Buchanan said, ``but they could take cues from that media emphasis,
and then the question is whether he can establish that kind of
credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of Bush's advisers dismissed the recurring questions
about Bush's mastery of policy or intellectual dexterity as insider
chatter that will seem condescending to most Americans, and Bush
has professed little or no concern about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '94 campaign, the same thing happened,'' Bush told
reporters in Manchester, N.H., a week ago, on a last swing through
the state before the holiday break. He was referring to his first,
successful race for governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``People said he's Daddy's boy and they said he's not smart
enough to be governor, he hasn't had the experience,'' Bush said.
``Look who's standing here as governor of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, his advisers' unbridled elation after the third December
debate, in which Bush appeared much more forceful and confident
than in the previous forums, suggested that they were more troubled
by criticisms of Bush than they had let on.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush's response when Larry King broached the subject during
a live interview on CNN on Dec. 16 gave the impression that Bush is
just as anxious to put the topic to rest.
</P>
<P>
   Although he often mentions his abhorrence of name-dropping and
pretension, intellectual and otherwise, and prides himself on being
more of a Texan than a Northeasterner, he invoked the ivy-draped
atmospheres of his college and business school when talking to King
about political opponents who questioned his smarts in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ignored the fact that I went to Yale and Harvard,'' Bush
said, neglecting to point out that his last name undoubtedly
facilitated his admission to both places.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had not previously appeared on King's CNN program, and his
agreement to the interview, along with a last-minute extension of
it to a full hour from a half hour, reflected his campaign's
conclusion that Bush generally does better in one-on-one situations
than in group formats, according to one adviser.
</P>
<P>
   But the adviser said that Bush and his aides understand that he
must take care to ward off any accusations that he is trying to
exert too much control over his public showcases. To that end, Bush
has agreed to at least four more debates in January, even though
his campaign had once expected that Bush would do a total of two
debates in December and January combined.
</P>
<P>
   The game has changed since then, and so has Bush's game plan,
although some advisers said that the alterations were inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iowa and New Hampshire have a cherished history of punishing
complacent front-runners,'' Reed said. ``So all this activity
conveys the message: I'm working hard, I'm not taking you for
granted.''

 &HT;    Georgia leaps in growth numbers
 &HT;    (EDS: CQ 'today' in lede as Wednesday.)
 &HT;    By Rhonda Cook
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia's population grew at twice thnal
average this year, according to numbers the U.S. Census Bureau
released today. Georgia ranked fourth in growth rate, as its
population increased by 2 percent; the national average was 0.9
percent. The three states that led Georgia in percentage of growth
are Nevada (3.8 percent), Arizona (2.4 percent) and Colorado (2.2
percent), all with smaller total populations.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia also is fourth in the estimated number of newcomers:
151,718. The state is estimated to have a population of 7,788,240 _
10th largest in the country.
</P>
<P>
   And officials see no end to the people explosion, with its
advantages and disadvantages.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's economy is good, experts say. But it's not clear if
that's what's attracting the people, or if it's the people coming
to the state that's attracting the businesses that hire them.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, there's a downside: The air quality and
traffic are bad in metro Atlanta, and the newcomers are throwing
local and state politics into chaos, according to a Census bureau
demographer and University of Georgia experts in sociology and
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes politics weird,'' said Douglas C. Bachtel, a UGA
sociologist. ``These folks are coming from other places and they
really don't have a political allegiance to anybody. So the
politics is they (politicians) have to have that right amount of
pizazz.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have people who are new to the area so everything is new
to them,'' said Marc Perry, a demographer with the U.S. Bureau of
Census. ``People are voting in elections where they not only don't
know the area and they don't know the elected officials. Even with
the most community-minded person it takes time. Just the notion of
community isn't something that can be formed overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   California, Texas and Florida experienced more total growth than
Georgia, but much of the growth in those three states was due to
people immigrating to this country.
</P>
<P>
   Almost half of the new people in Georgia moved here from another
state; 41 percent of the increase is due to births, and 9 percent
immigrated from another country.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, California's growth came from foreign immigrants
and births. In Florida, half the growth was ``domestic migration,''
people moving from other states, and the other half is attributed
to immigration from other counties.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 percent of new Texans were born there this year, while
a little more than 25 percent immigrated from outside the United
States and the remainder came from other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``The different population dynamics ... will require different
types of upkeep,'' demographer Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the Census Bureau issued estimates that
showed the Atlanta metropolitan area was the second fastest growing
area in the country. According to data compiled by the Atlanta
Regional Commission, 60 percent of the new Georgians live in the
10-county Atlanta metro region, which is strangling on its traffic
and bad air blamed on that growth.
</P>
<P>
   The area's population passed 3 million in 1996. Today, there are
more than 3.7 million people in the 10 counties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were supposed to hit 3 million by 2000,'' ARC spokeswoman
Ann Dishman said. ``We're already there.''
</P>
<P>
   That could mean good news for Republicans, who gained
significantly after political lines were redrawn based on the
results of the 1990 Census.
</P>
<P>
   ``You move into an area and don't know the personalities of the
candidates. What you fall back on is party identification,'' said
Charles Bullock, a University of Georgia political scientist. ``If
you're a Republican at home, you're likely to be a Republican if
you move to Sandy Springs.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry said some newcomers to the state are senior citizens who
retired to Florida and then relocated to North Georgia, but many of
the people migrating here are young.
</P>
<P>
   And early trends in the population influxes _ young, often
well-educated _ tended to favor Republicans, Bullock said.
</P>
<P>
   While the Georgia Legislature is still dominated by Democrats,
the state's U.S. House delegation includes three Democrats and
eight Republicans. One of its U.S. senators is a Democrat and the
other is a Republican.

45,000 ASK IRS FOR RELIEF FROM LIABILITIES OF TAX-CHEATING
SPOUSES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa, N.J., Del.)   By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Loretta TenPass directs each woman who comes to see her in
downtown Des Moines, Iowa, to a private room, puts out a box of
tissues and listens as the women ``blow off steam and make comments
about their spouse, about what a terrible situation it was or why
they did what they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the women are divorced and are soon drawn back into the
tangle of emotions over their broken bonds, desperate to explain or
justify what happened, Mrs. TenPass said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. TenPass is not a marriage counselor. She is an auditor for
the Internal Revenue Service. The people to whom she listens _
virtually all of them women _ are hoping to be excused from taxes
they say they owe because their spouse, or former spouse, secretly
cheated on their joint return.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Congress heard testimony from four women who said that
years after their husbands left they discovered that they had been
cheating on their taxes and that the IRS expected them to pay huge
bills, including interest. In response, Congress made it easier for
them not to pay such taxes, as part of the IRS Restructuring and
Reform Act of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS expected no more than 3,000 new ``innocent spouse''
claims in the year since then, but more than 45,000 applications,
more than 90 percent of them filed by women, have already been
logged, 15 times the anticipated number.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of new applications arrive each week. That number may
grow because a growing number of lawyers now file an innocent
spouse claim along with divorce papers, either protectively or as a
way to bargain for a better settlement against spouses fearful of
an audit.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, the IRS anticipated that most cases were simple
enough to be handled by lower-level auditors like Mrs. TenPass, and
Congress gave the IRS extra money only for such auditors. It
quickly became clear, however, that highly trained revenue agents
would be required to sort out the tax liabilities of couples whose
lives were once so entwined that they presented themselves to the
government as one taxpayer.
</P>
<P>
   In all the IRS has pulled about 500 auditors, more than 3
percent of its auditing force, mostly from the hunt for tax
cheating by businesses and wealthier Americans to dig through the
detritus of divorce.
</P>
<P>
   In each of the 33 IRS districts at least one audit group of 10
to 15 auditors was told to stop hunting for tax cheating by
companies and high-income individuals and to deal exclusively with
innocent spouse cases.
</P>
<P>
   Even that was not enough to handle the work, so other revenue
agents now find innocent spouse cases landing on their desks. ``We
are putting our tiptop, most educated people on this, when it was
supposed to be a clerical function,'' said one veteran revenue
officer on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   The complexity of innocent spouse cases requires expertise at
subtle issues, said Steve Pyrek, an IRS spokesman, in part to make
sure that a couple, even a divorced couple, is not whipsawing the
government to evade taxes.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that one reason for the high level of staffing is that
to help taxpayers each case is reviewed to determine if any of the
three forms of relief is available, even if the taxpayer applies
for only one.
</P>
<P>
   Pyrek said that a detailed analysis of 1,000 cases is under way
``to identify the different sources of complexity and develop
criteria that will enable us to assign them to employees for the
most efficient and effective handling.''
</P>
<P>
   This reassignment of auditors is one reason that fewer than one
in 300 individual tax returns will be audited in the current fiscal
year, down from one in 217 two years ago and one in 63 two decades
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulties in handling innocent spouse cases illustrate
how the IRS is struggling to adjust to new rules imposed by
Congress and to a new commissioner who emphasizes customer service.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. William V. Roth Jr., R-Del., who was a prime sponsor of
innocent spouse relief, said that ``the fact that the number of
innocent spouse cases has increased so dramatically is a
demonstration that the IRS is acknowledging this important
classification, and working to see that these innocent women are
made whole.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that until the new law was implemented a year ago
``countless individuals who could rightfully claim innocent spouse
protection were not receiving the treatment and relief they
deserved. While the IRS must continue to properly implement the new
innocent spouse protections, we can see _ even at this early stage
_ that the changes we made have been successful in providing relief
to those who, through no fault of their own, were being pursued for
debts owed by their ex-spouses.''
</P>
<P>
   The new law could not have come too soon for Americans like a
57-year-old school administrator in northern New Jersey who agreed
to be identified only by her middle name, Ann. She was married for
22 years to a business consultant who filed several business
returns for his enterprises as part of their tax return.
</P>
<P>
   The couple were audited in 1986 through 1988, the last years
they were together, and the IRS determined that they owed a lot of
taxes on his business profits. The IRS pursued the husband
unsuccessfully for nearly a decade, then, in 1997, turned its
sights on her. The agency garnished the woman's wages for hundreds
of dollars a month. ``Suddenly I had less than $1,000 a month to
live on and I was putting my daughter through college,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the revenue officer assigned to her case had no
sympathy ``because I am educated and articulate, but when it comes
to tax law and to the details behind how my former husband arrived
at the figures on the tax returns for his business I am
illiterate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rutgers Law School's tax clinic persuaded the IRS to lift
the garnishment in return for $250 monthly payments, which the
woman said she feared would continue for the rest of her life.
</P>
<P>
   When the IRS law was passed last year she applied for relief.
``A few weeks ago I got back the $3,000 I had paid and I even got
interest on my money.''

 &HT;    Gun linked to rap star belonged to Georgia man
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa and Yolanda Rodriguez
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ New York authorities said Tuesday that a gun found in
rapper Sean ``Puffy'' Combs' vehicle early Monday was stolen from a
Powder Springs, Ga., construction worker who reported it missing in
August.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the
New York Police Department said the weapon _ a 9 mm Smith &AMP; Wesson
model 915 handgun _ was the same gun Ralph Cooper reported stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Powder Springs Detective Sgt. Matt Atkins said he received a
telephone call about the gun Monday from NYPD Investigator Tommy
Petito,. who is assigned to the ATF/NYPD Joint Firearms Task Force.
</P>
<P>
   According to a police report, Cooper told police the weapon had
been taken from the console of his 1994 F-150 pickup truck. Cooper
could not be reached for comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hadn't seen the gun for about a month and then reported it
missing,'' Atkins said. ``A cell phone was also taken from the
truck.''
</P>
<P>
   When New York officials and the ATF traced the gun, found Monday
in Combs' 1999 Lincoln Navigator, the feedback they received from
the National Crime Information Center revealed the weapon had been
stolen in Powder Springs, a New York police spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Combs was arrested in the wee hours along with girlfriend
singer/actress Jennifer Lopez. The two were stopped by New York
cops after they bolted from the scene of a shooting outside Club NY
in Times Square, police said. Three people were injured in the
melee.
</P>
<P>
   Combs, charged with weapons possession, was released on $10,000
bail and ordered back to court Feb. 14. Lopez, known for her work
in the films ``Selena'' and ``Out of Sight,'' was not charged and
released after more than 10 hours of questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Charged in the shooting was Jamal Barrow, 19, who raps under the
name ``Shyne.'' Barrow was charged with three counts of attempted
murder Monday, police said. Investigators accused Combs of
brandishing a gun inside the club, but he emphatically denied it.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Tuesday in New York, Combs said: ``Under no
circumstances whatsoever did I have anything to do with a shooting.
I do not own a gun nor did I have possession of a gun that night. I
had nothing to do with a shooting in this club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make this 100 percent clear.''

UNDATED: my money.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   While taxpayers like Ann are satisfied, many others see problems
with the way the IRS is dealing with the innocent spouse effort.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawyers who specialize in divorce and tax issues say the
agency is spending too much time on such cases, and in some
instances making them needlessly complicated. They say the agency
is wasting resources that could be better focused on hunting for
tax cheats.
</P>
<P>
   Investigating innocent spouse cases can entail lengthy
interviews and correspondence with both the person seeking relief
and the former spouse.
</P>
<P>
   Marjorie A. O'Connell, a Washington lawyer who for 17 years has
published a monthly update on divorce tax issues for lawyers, said
the IRS should accept most cases at face value rather than
regarding them skeptically, for several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   First, the new law says a taxpayer can choose to separate her
liability from her spouse's. Second, unless the IRS can prove the
individual knew that her former spouse was cheating, which is
extremely hard, it must excuse her from the taxes. ``The standard
is not that you should have known, but that you had actual
knowledge, which is very difficult for the IRS to prove,'' Ms.
O'Connell said.
</P>
<P>
   Third, she said, the IRS's own analysis shows that the agency
will collect only about a penny on the dollar of such old tax
debts, making it hardly worth much investigative time.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases the costs of investigation outweigh the dollars
involved. The IRS has not disclosed statistics on the average
amount involved in innocent spouse claims, but several agents said
they think that $3,000 is a typical amount of tax before penalties
and interest. One Long Island tax auditor said she was working a
case valued at $400.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. O'Connell called formerly married women ``the best customers
the IRS has. They work for wages, keep bank accounts and don't hide
from the IRS.'' Yet, she said, they are still treated as suspected
tax cheats by many revenue agents, a sign that the drive by Charles
O. Rossotti, the Internal Revenue commissioner, to make the tax
agency customer friendly has a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   The tax agency's decision to thoroughly investigate innocent
spouse cases has an unintended side effect that undercuts its new
focus on customer service, revenue agents say.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no reduction in my case inventory when they added
these innocent spouse cases,'' said another revenue agent on Long
Island, who like most of those interviewed declined to be
identified, ``so that means I have to tell people who are in
examination that I will get back to them later. That means you are
going to owe more in interest'' if the audit results in a bigger
tax bill, as 85 percent do, ``which is gonna make some people very
unhappy if they figure this out.''
</P>
<P>
   The new law also makes life easier for people whose spouses
cheated than for people whose spouses merely didn't pay taxes owed.
Under the law a person whose spouse did not pay the taxes has no
specific entitlement for relief and must instead rely on the grace
of IRS officials to dismiss the tax. If the spouse cheated on the
return, however, then the former wife is specifically entitled to
get out of the taxes due.

REICHHELD STILL PROMOTES VIRTUES OF LOYALTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Management Column) 
(DW) 
 By FRED ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In the '90s, a tough, impatient decade that has given
loyalty a drubbing, Frederick F. Reichheld has always been
loyalty's champion in business. Reichheld produced the hard numbers
showing that a seasoned employee, treated properly, was two or
three times as productive as someone just in the door.
</P>
<P>
   No one ever questioned that customer loyalty was a good thing.
But precious few companies actually understood how powerful a lever
a committed customer was. Reichheld, a management consultant at
Bain &AMP; Co. in Boston, had the tally: keeping just 5 percent more of
those customers who would otherwise slide away could lift profits
by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed, but he still preaches that loyalty, an
old-fashioned virtue, is fundamental to business success on the
Internet. This season Amazon.com, for one, with its obsession with
serving customers, is singing Fred Reichheld's song.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone understands that e-commerce economics requires enormous
expenditures upfront to attract a clientele. This holiday season
was a critical test of which ``e-tailers'' could win out in pulling
customers to their sites.
</P>
<P>
   That's only a start. Those customers have to stick around. The
Internet measures a site's ``stickiness'' in minutes; profitability
is reckoned in years. According to preliminary research by Bain and
others, it will take three to four years of loyal patronage just to
break even on what is now being spent to drag customers in the
door.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economics of loyalty just gets applied so much more
powerfully,'' Reichheld said in an interview last week. ``If you
think about the true economics of an Internet business: they've got
this big acquisition cost, and then they've got a potential annuity
of income if they treat people right and earn their loyalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Reichheld believes the Internet has enormous potential for
serving customers better, with richer information, interactive
relationships and innovative services. ``There are so many creative
things you can do for the customer's lifetime experience,'' he
said, ``lots of ways to create a unique, distinctive and much
better customer experience.''
</P>
<P>
   From what he has seen so far, however, ``very few'' companies
are going to be able to hold their customers for three to four
years. Acquisition costs for the pure Internet e-tailers are
``going up like crazy,'' he said, while the customers they attract
tend to surf from one retail site to another. ``They're snagging
fundamentally disloyal butterfly kinds of customers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary research on consumers' Internet shopping habits
and projected loyalties shows some traditional merchants like
Lands' End and L.L. Bean doing very well. They are attracting
barnacles, not butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty convinced that the existing firms, as they add
Internet capabilities, are going to cream pure-play Internet,''
Reichheld said. Some traditional merchants enjoy customer retention
rates 10 to 20 percentage points higher than their newer
competition. Normally, trailing the competition by 20 points in
customer loyalty ``is enough to put you out of business,'' he
noted. ``Ten points is very weak returns.''
</P>
<P>
   Reichheld's core doctrine is engraved in stone: Companies that
cultivate loyal customers, loyal employees, loyal investors,
consistently outperform their competition. Reichheld first built a
Bain practice and then a philosophy on that observation.
</P>
<P>
   ``One, it all starts with trust,'' he said. ``If you don't earn
your customer's trust, you won't make money on the Internet. Two,
unless you have superior economics _ a strategy for building real
economic advantage _ you're not worthy of trust. Three, customer
selection is more vital than ever. There is so much churn out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Reichheld is an idealist and a perfectionist. On average, he
notes, American companies lose roughly half their customers in five
years, half their employees in four. The huge expense of replacing
them offends his perfectionist streak. And the emerging career
pattern of workers jumping from employer to employer strikes him as
a sad failure. It is ``sheer hogwash'' to preach that message to
young people, he declared.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great company is where you want to end up and spend most of
your life,'' he said. ``Most of life is a search for people and
institutions worthy of your loyalty and commitment. People yearn
for that. That's why the marines are not short on recruiting.''
</P>
<P>
   At 47 and financially secure, Reichheld has retired from client
engagements. His Bain partners made him the first Bain Fellow, a
half-time senior position that permits him to concentrate on
extending his loyalty research. He gave a score of speeches this
year, and he is three-quarters through writing a book on corporate
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``This idea of treating people right, principled relationships _
it doesn't just happen naturally,'' he said. ``It takes leaders who
have the ability to put others' interests ahead, to take a long
time frame, and to bring things into that framework.''
</P>
<P>
   Every year or so, most recently in October, Reichheld assembles
a circle of chief executives from companies he admires. The
collection is as varied as Intuit, Vanguard, Harley Davidson,
Chick-fil-A, Northwestern Mutual Life, State Farm, A.G. Edwards,
Enterprise Rent-a-Car, ServiceMaster and Bright Horizons Family
Solutions. That select circle provides sketches from life for his
book on leadership _ far-sighted executives like Scott Cook of
Intuit, Benjamin F. Edwards III of A.G. Edwards and S. Truett Cathy
of Chick-fil-A.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Reichheld's first book, ``The Loyalty Effect''
(Harvard Business School Press), debunked the notion that loyalty
is dead. It also put loyalty economics on the map. It showed, for
instance, that when a brokerage house improved its retention of
brokers to 90 percent from 80 percent, it more than doubled the
potential value of a new hire.
</P>
<P>
   For one credit card company, a 5 percent increase in customer
retention translated into a 75 percent increase in the average
customer's lifetime value to the company. Typically, a customer
generated $40 in profit the first year, $106 in the 10th and $161
in the 20th. Customers who stick around tend to buy more, are much
cheaper to serve, bring in friends as referrals, and accept premium
pricing. Over the years, that all compounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old world,'' Reichheld said, ``you can have medium
loyalty and still make a buck,'' protected by a convenient location
or the customer's lack of information. In the Internet world, there
will be no place to hide, no substitute for earning high loyalty.
``The economics are going to be obvious,'' he predicted. ``People
are going to be forced to do the right thing or get out of
business.''

HUNDREDS GREET SUCCESSFUL SHUTTLE ASTRONAUTS

   HOUSTON _ Several hundred well-wishers greeted NASA's Discovery
astronauts Tuesday as they returned to Houston following their
successful mission to repair the Hubble Space Telescope.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery's eight-day flight ended Monday night with a landing
at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. After medical exams, a
reunion with family members and a rest, they flew back to their
Houston-area homes Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did we have an awesome mission or what?'' Discovery commander
Curt Brown asked the crowd of mostly Johnson Space Center workers
that greeted him and the six other astronauts as they arrived at
Ellington Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we did a great job,'' said Brown as he, pilot Scott
Kelly, flight engineer Jean Francois Clervoy, Steve Smith, Mike
Foale, John Grunsfeld and Claude Nicollier received a round of
applause.
</P>
<P>
   During their eight days in space, Discovery's astronauts
rendezvoused with the Hubble Space Telescope and with three
spacewalks restored its disabled pointing control system and made
other repairs. No longer able to conduct astronomical observations
when the shuttle astronauts arrived, the Hubble is scheduled to
resume science activities in January as a result of their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hubble will show us things we never imagined,'' predicted
Grunsfeld, an astronomer turned astronaut who was among the
spacewalk repair team. ``What we will see will really blow our
minds.''
</P>
<P>
   The $4 billion observatory was launched in 1990. Discovery's
visit and others planned by the shuttle in 2001 and 2003 are
intended to keep the Hubble operational until 2010.

 &HT;    Filmmaker hopes to leave digital mark
 &HT;    By Maria Mallory
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Here's the storyline: A young surgical assistant
working at an Army mobile hospital unit spends his time off
shooting documentary-style films with an old-time Super 8 camera.
With no projector at the camp, he can't view his films. Still, his
hospital colleagues sometimes help him, playing bit parts in the
short films he writes.
</P>
<P>
   Sound like a scene from ``MASH''?
</P>
<P>
   It was. But this was a real-life Army hospital in Vietnam, not
the TV show or movie. And, the nascent filmmaker wasn't Radar,
Hawkeye or any other fictitious character. He was Gary Moss.
</P>
<P>
   Today, as codirector of Georgia State University's Digital Arts
and Entertainment Lab, Moss has long since hung up his surgical
scrubs. His Super 8 collects dust on a nearby bookcase in his
office; there's still no projector around to show its work.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Moss, a 1989 Academy Award nominee who serves as a sort
of artist in residence, teaches GSU film students how to use the
DAEL's multimillion dollar supercomputer and cutting-edge digital
editing and compositing equipment, the high-tech tools of
next-generation filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to create a film school for the upcoming
millennium,'' says Moss. ``We have full digital film or video
capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   Digital film is what ``Stars Wars,'' ``Titanic,'' ``Waterworld''
and every big-budget, special-effects movie uses to create movie
magic, Moss says.
</P>
<P>
   The digital difference is dramatic. In the past century, film
has been done in an analog format, where light hits the film,
leaving an image to be captured on the developed medium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Analog is literally a representation or likeness of something.
It's a mirror that's held up to the world,'' Moss said.
</P>
<P>
   Most movies are currently made this way, and the limitations are
great.
</P>
<P>
   ``With analog, when you try to manipulate (the filmed image), it
degrades because there's no way to blow it up and shrink it down
without degrading the image,'' explains Moss.
</P>
<P>
   For conventional filmmaking, that means building models _
miniature or life-sized _ to shoot scenes such as mass destruction
from a tidal wave or Fay Wray sitting in King Kong's hand.
</P>
<P>
   With digital filmmaking, the computer takes center stage,
converting analog images into high-tech code that can be altered by
the filmmaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We start out with pictures and end up with zeroes and ones,''
data that can be changed without forfeiting the realism of the
original image.
</P>
<P>
   While models and sets are still used, with digital filmmaking
the Titanic sails toward a monstrous computer-generated iceberg,
not a cheesy wooden model.
</P>
<P>
   Or, take ``Waterworld,'' for instance. When Kevin Costner's bald
spot began to show, the filmmakers simply filled it in with a
digitally generated thatch of hair. Around the industry, this
practice became known as Costner's $1 million digital hair
replacement, Moss says.
</P>
<P>
   GSU's DAEL is home to a Cineon Digital Film System, the
cutting-edge special-effects technology used to transform analog
film into digital code and back to film. Using a process called
compositing, DAEL students use the digital scanner and
supercomputer to combine on film images that are computer-generated
or recorded on videotape.
</P>
<P>
   DAEL is the only university film lab possessing this technology.
</P>
<P>
   A digital cinema is under construction at the film school.
Instead of the traditional projectors now used in movie houses
across the world, the DAEL digital cinema will employ prototype
digital video projectors that incorporate technology that would
allow real-time changes to films based on audience response.
</P>
<P>
   Even with all the technology, Moss insists ``storytelling is
still 90 percent of filmmaking.''
</P>
<P>
   In the nearly three decades since he began recording his stories
on film, the writer, producer and director has won numerous awards
for his work, which has aired on public television, broadcast
networks and cable.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, he started an in-house film production unit at GSU, and
in 1989, his film ``Gullah Tales,'' a look at the African-American
Sea Island culture and storytelling traditions, was nominated in
the live action short film category of the Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring, Moss will retire from Georgia State to devote
full-time attention to filmmaking and screenwriting.

STATE STREET TO TAKE $57 MILLION CHARGE FOR FOURTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ State Street Corp. will take a fourth-quarter charge of
$57 million after rising interest rates prompted it to sell more
than one-third of its investment portfolio at a loss, but the
company said the shortfall would be offset by gains from the
earlier sale of its commercial banking business.
</P>
<P>
   State Street, one of the world's largest institutional asset
custodians and investors, said Tuesday that it remained on track to
meet earnings targets, which First Call has estimated at 73 cents
per share for the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can assume our operating earnings are going to be on
track,'' Ronald O'Kelley, State Street's chief financial officer,
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The company said rising domestic interest rates had led it to
sell $5.2 billion in securities, mostly US Treasury and government
agency notes, and to use the proceeds to purchase higher-yielding
paper. The sale would result in a one-time pre-tax charge of 21
cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   State Street's move to reposition part of the $14.4 billion in
investment securities on its balance sheet comes at a good time for
the company, which expects to record a gain of $164 million, or $1
a share, from the sale of its commercial banking business to
Citizens Financial Group Inc in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll be able to recoup the loss over the next 18 months by
reinvesting,'' said Maitland Lammert, who covers the company for
Edward Jones, a brokerage. ``And it's an opportune time to take a
loss, since they'll have a gain for the quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Kelley said the higher-yielding securities would be a good
deal for shareholders, and would add 3 cents a share each quarter
in 2000. Shares in State Street, which announced its repositioning
after markets closed, rose 1 1/4 to close at 71 1/4 Tuesday on the
New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   While banks around the country are taking advantage of recent
gains to reposition loss-making portfolios amid higher interest
rates, State Street's securities sale marked the first time the
company had undertaken such a move. The sale accounted for 36
percent of the investment securities on State Street's balance
sheet as of Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the move could be read as a sign that State Street
believes interest rates will rise in the coming year, since the
paper it bought has higher yields.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter of 1998, State Street earned $110.7
million, or 68 cents per share. Lammert estimated the company's
1999 earnings at $488 million, or $2.98 a share, one penny below
estimates by IBIS, an earnings forecaster. State Street earned $436
million, or $2.66 a share, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings estimates covering the current quarter reflect a lower
growth rate because they no longer include State Street's sold
banking unit.
</P>
<P>
   State Street, which has grown rapidly for two decades, said it
was on track to achieve double-digit revenue growth in the coming
decade.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts have expressed concern that the company's
growth rate has fallen from the mid-teens to the 11 percent to 12
percent range. An analyst for Fox-Pitt Kelton who did not wish to
be identified said the slowdown was partly due to weaker business
from customers preoccupied with resolving their millennium computer
bug problems.

CLAYTON MOORE, THE LONE RANGER TO THE END, DIES AT 85 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif., Texas, Mich., Ill.)  (jw) 
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clayton Moore, who grew up wanting to be a cowboy or a policeman
and fulfilled both ambitions by playing the Lone Ranger on
television, in the movies and at nostalgia shows, died Tuesday at
West Hills Hospital in West Hills, Calif. He was 85 and was
portraying the Masked Man long after his hair color perfectly
matched his silver bullets,
</P>
<P>
   Moore apparently suffered a heart attack at his home in
Calabasas, a hospital spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Some two dozen actors have played the champion of law and order
in the Old West since the Lone Ranger first appeared on radio in
1933. But Moore was the most visible kemo sabe (trusty scout, in
Tonto talk). He was the Lone Ranger in 169 episodes of a popular
television series that ran from 1949 to 1957, teaming up with Jay
Silverheels, a Canadian-born Mohawk, who played his faithful Indian
companion Tonto.
</P>
<P>
   Moore also got to call a hearty ``Hi-yo, Silver, away!'' over
the strains of Rossini's ``William Tell'' Overture in two Hollywood
movies, ``The Lone Ranger'' (1956) and ``The Lone Ranger and the
Lost City of Gold'' (1958). And when television and the movies had
enough of his Lone Ranger, he simply refused to relinquish the role
and turned up in full regalia for rodeos, shopping mall shows, a
pizza commercial and promotional stints with the Texas Rangers
baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   Who was that masked man?
</P>
<P>
   He was born Jack Carlton Moore on Sept. 14, 1914, on the South
Side of Chicago, the son of a real-estate broker. As a youngster he
spent Saturday afternoons in Chicago's Devon Theater watching the
serials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would give anything to be up there on the screen with Ken
Maynard, Tom Mix, George O'Brien, William S. Hart, Harry Carey Sr.,
so many wonderful cowboy heroes,'' Moore remembered in his
autobiography, ``I Was That Masked Man'' (1996). ``Whenever anyone
asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, I said either, `I want
to be a policeman,' or `I want to be a cowboy.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Moore embarked on a career in show business with a trapeze act
at the Century of Progress exposition in Chicago in 1934, then
worked for modeling agencies in Chicago and New York. In 1937, he
went to Hollywood and became Clayton Moore.
</P>
<P>
   After roles in westerns and swashbucklers, he found his niche at
Republic Pictures in the 1940s, starring in the kind of Saturday
serials that had fascinated him as a youngster. He battled a
gorilla in ``The Perils of Nyoka,'' played the lead role in ``Jesse
James Rides Again'' and was a tough guy in ``G-Men Never Forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore was also the star of the 1949 serial ``The Ghost of
Zorro,'' playing the grandson of the original Zorro and donning
Grandpa's mask to thwart a villain's schemes.
</P>
<P>
   One mask led to another.
</P>
<P>
   The broadcasting executive George Washington Trendle and the
writer Fran Striker, who created the Lone Ranger for the Detroit
radio station WXYZ in 1933, were searching around for an actor who
could play the Lone Ranger when he moved from radio to television.
After catching Moore in the Zorro film, they gave him the role.
</P>
<P>
   A trim but broad-shouldered six-footer, Moore was a fine
horseman and cut a handsome and commanding presence. But he lacked
the kind of deep voice brought to the character by Brace Beemer,
who had played the Lone Ranger on radio since 1941 and would
continue in that role until the radio series ended in 1954. So
Moore listened to recordings of his predecessor and practiced
singing scales in an effort to match Beemer's properly sonorous
tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lone Ranger'' made its debut on television on Sept. 15,
1949, the first western series ever produced specifically for
television. ``Hopalong Cassidy'' and other television westerns had
been edited versions of movies originally shown in theaters.
</P>
<P>
   The Lone Ranger returned television's first children's
generation to ``those thrilling days of yesteryear.'' Viewers
learned that the Lone Ranger was the sole survivor of six Texas
Rangers ambushed by the Cavendish gang and that he wore a mask so
he wouldn't be recognized by the desperados. The opening of each
episode had the white-hatted Moore taking Silver, the ``fiery horse
with the speed of light,'' through his paces.
</P>
<P>
   Moore appeared on the television series every year except for
one season _ September 1952 to September 1953 _ when the producers
replaced him with John Hart, an actor who had been in earlier
``Lone Ranger'' episodes, often playing the bad guy. Moore said he
received no explanation for why he was replaced and why he was
returned. In the later programs, in addition to being the Lone
Ranger, he also appeared in secondary roles _ a comic Frenchman, a
circus clown, a Mexican bandit and an Irishman.
</P>
<P>
   When Moore took the Lone Ranger to Hollywood, Bosley Crowther,
the film critic of The New York Times, observed that he displayed
``passionate earnestness'' although he ``looks like a New Jersey
state trooper, with more black leather around him than a
motorcyclist.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Lone Ranger took his last ride on television in June
1957, Moore decided to continue as a career Lone Ranger, embarking
on the personal appearances trail. Except for a role in one episode
on TV's ``Lassie,'' he never played another character.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Two decades later, Wrather Corp., which had bought the rights to
the Lone Ranger from Trendle in 1954 for $3 million, asked Moore to
stop wearing his mask at public appearances. It anticipated hiring
a younger actor, Klinton Spilsbury, for a new Lone Ranger movie and
decided that America wasn't big enough for two Masked Men.
</P>
<P>
   But Moore balked at removing the mask. ``This country needs
heroes, and there aren't many left,'' he said. ``For many
Americans, the Lone Ranger is a hero, and people don't want to see
their heroes shot down.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on talk shows and held news conferences to press his
case and reported receiving 400,000 letters of support.
</P>
<P>
   After the Wrather Corp. obtained a court order in 1979
restraining him from wearing the Lone Ranger's black mask in paid
public appearances, Moore resorted to wearing sunglasses cut in the
shape of a mask.
</P>
<P>
   The movie that inspired the lawsuit _ ``The Legend of the Lone
Ranger'' _ was released in 1981. It lost more than $11 million.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing the film for The Times, Janet Maslin observed, ``One
measure of the movie's reckless wrong-headedness is the fact that
no one even persuaded Klinton Spilsbury to do something about his
name.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The early 1980s were a wrenching time for Moore. Jay
Silverheels, who remained his friend long after their television
series ended and who had run a workshop for Indian actors, died in
1980. His wife of 43 years, the former Sally Allen, died in 1986.
Moore is survived by their daughter, Dawn Gerrity of Los Angeles,
and by his fourth wife, Clarita Petrone.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, the Wrather Corp., its Hollywood movie having come and
gone, relented, and Moore was given permission to don his full
regalia again at promotional appearances. At age 70, the old kemo
sabe could take off his sunglasses and wear his real Lone Ranger
mask once more. He was thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   As he put it: `It's my symbol, it's the Lone Ranger, and if I
may say, it's Americana. I guess when I go up to the big ranch in
the sky, I'll still have it on.''

 &HT;    BellSouth veteran says system ready
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You've got to have a dial tone _ and it is Rick
Harder's job to make sure that you will.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth, the dominant provider of local phone service in the
Southeast, is in the business of providing a connection. As the
company's Y2K guru, Harder says BellSouth has spent four years and
more than $200 million making sure that the links will live through
the arrival of Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The millennium will come and _ despite the months of talk about
technology meltdowns _ the phones will work.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in the spring, BellSouth ran a series of intense tests
that seemed to prove that any Y2K problem was pretty much licked,
leaving Harder expecting a smooth transition to the new year _ at
least for the phone system.
</P>
<P>
   But despite his optimism as NewYear's Eve approaches, he and
more than 300 members of the company's Y2K team will move into
BellSouth Center, sleeping in nearby hotels until Jan. 5. Then,
assuming all goes well, they will disperse, heading back to their
normal lives. They will be called together again Feb. 12, this time
to hold the New Year's Eve celebration that they missed while the
world was watching the ball drop in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   And they will return to battle stations Feb. 29 _ just in case.
Because 2000 starts with a leap year, that date marks a last chance
for any Y2K problems to raise their heads.
</P>
<P>
   If Harder and his team have been successful, if the Y2K glitch
has been utterly eradicated, then people will hear just about
nothing from BellSouth about any service problems. Dial tones will
be there when customers pick up the phone. New phones will be
installed as planned. Repairs will happen on time. Emergency calls
will zip right through to police or fire departments and customer
bills will be accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Rick Harder can go on to something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is kind of a pivotal point in my career. Afterwards, I'd
like to step back and assess where I go from here. If history is
any indication, there's always some kind of catastrophe situation _
or maybe I just seem to draw the short straw.''
</P>
<P>
   He took on the Y2K job in 1996. It wasn't a job he eagerly
sought, he said. ``I can't remember a job I have had that I asked
for from 33 years in the company. These things just come.''
</P>
<P>
   Harder, 52, started working for BellSouth in 1966 when he was a
student in Memphis, Tenn. Despite his technical responsibilities,
he is no engineer, having majored in English and political science.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't feel unprepared, he said. ``Isn't business really
only about two things? Communications and politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the issue came to the fore in the mid-1990s, BellSouth has
been methodical about handling the Y2K threat, Harder said. No one
person had to rally the company to act, and no one has fought the
effort, either. BellSouth joined with other large
telecommunications companies in researching the question and
planning a response.
</P>
<P>
   That reaction geared up steadily, so that virtually every
BellSouth employee was involved at one time or another, Harder
said. ``On any given day, 500 to 1,000 people are working on
this.''
</P>
<P>
   For Harder, work on Y2K has meant a continuation of his long
hours and commuting routine.
</P>
<P>
   He has been commuting for six years from his home in Birmingham,
Ala., to Atlanta, where he has an apartment. When his first
assignment in Atlanta started, his children, both now in college,
were at an age where he and his wife just didn't want them moved.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's close enough so that when the kids were in high
school, I'd get over there for concerts and plays and ballgames.
It's not that bad an arrangement, honestly. I'm getting too old to
move again. I've moved nine times working for the phone company and
I just couldn't see the 10th.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Sundays, he drives east, then heads back to Alabama at
week's end, noticing people on the road who do the commute in
reverse. He says his wife, a former phone company manager,
understands.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's one of the old `Bell-heads' like me. She's worked
through snowstorms and tornadoes. It goes along the way of doing
the job.''
</P>
<P>
   By October, BellSouth had spent about $235 million on Y2K. By
the end of the effort, sometime in 2000, the price tag will be
about $265 million, he said. ``It's kind of like the flu. Before
you know it, you are fully engaged.''
</P>
<P>
   The project was daunting.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth has 70,000 desktop computers. More critically,
BellSouth had to check the systems that run the networks, as well
as software and hardware _ a total of about 270,000 components.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K sleuths searched for embedded chips that might have a
date function, for software that might condition some actions on
the passage of time.
</P>
<P>
   Then, BellSouth had to test as much of its systems as possible.
Most of the work was done at labs in Birmingham or Jackson, Miss.,
where engineers would turn forward clocks to New Year's then watch
the results. For months, they tinkered with the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't a point at which we didn't think it was going to
be OK, but it was a matter of convincing ourselves that it was
going to be all right,'' Harder said.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, the nation's large companies began waking to
the Y2K problem. They realized that much of the software on their
computers had been designed to indicate dates with just the final
two digits _ leaving open the chance that a computer would identity
the year 2000 as 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Harder says that the network that carries calls would not have
crashed, but that various support systems _ like billing and repair
_ could have been fooled. Badly. For instance, a call made early in
the new year might have been viewed as having begun on Jan. 1, 1900
_ and the customer might be billed for a connection of 52.6 million
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The charge for that ``call'' would be about $5.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   After three years of work to make sure that didn't happen,
BellSouth ran their elaborate tests. Pretty much everything worked.
``At that point in time, I was very confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Harder can't guarantee there won't be problems. But he does
think the Y2K problems in BellSouth's network have been eliminated.
``I am very confident that there won't be any significant Y2K
disturbance. The biggest issue will be network congestion, and that
depends on what is going on elsewhere in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Just in case problems occur anyway, BellSouth has spent the last
few months preparing contingency plans, Harder said. ``They range
from the ridiculous to the sublime. (For instance), if your order
entry system goes down, you take a pencil and pad and start writing
down orders.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth won't have to wait until midnight in Atlanta to see
how it's going. Harder will monitor reports from the other side of
the planet as the New Year arrives in a succession of BellSouth
offices. Sweeping westward with the sun, news will come from China,
India, Israel and Germany. Then finally it will be 2000 in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will take a quick snapshot at the stroke of midnight, of
switches and the 911 system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, something could go wrong. The most likely problem at
midnight of the 31st would be too many people picking up receivers
at the same moment _ something the system cannot handle on any day.
If that does happen, some folks won't get a dial tone until others
hang up. But it won't be because Y2K has crashed the network.
</P>
<P>
   If there are Y2K problems, Harder's team will move to solve them
quickly. But Harder looks forward to the flipping of the calendar
page knowing that he cannot truly be a hero _ even if he succeeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``If nothing goes wrong, you'll get beat up for spending $265
million,'' he said. ``If something does go wrong, you'll get
clobbered.''

 &HT;    CNN unsure of outside influences
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ CNN has done all it can to make sure you still will
hear James Earl Jones say ``This is CNN,'' early Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   But CNN, the global news channel part of Turner Broadcasting
System, does not have the final say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no control over the third party,'' said Landel Hobbs,
the Turner Broadcasting executive who coordinated TBS's push to
make sure the Atlanta-based piece of Time Warner is ready for the
change. ``We rely on what they've told us. We feel good about it,
but we rely on third parties. We don't control the bird in the air
(the satellite) or the software, the water or the power. There are
no guarantees.''
</P>
<P>
   The signal beamed from CNN or TBS travels a torturous route
before it reaches your home. Beamed to satellites controlled by
software, it is then sent to head-end equipment owned by cable
television companies. The head-end hardware then sends the Andy
Griffith reruns to your Zenith.
</P>
<P>
   By now, most if not all companies have spent millions of dollars
testing their computer systems to make sure they will withstand the
passage of time Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   But some companies won't know with certainty whether the Year
2000 bug will cripple its computer systems until somewhere around
midnight Friday, when the millennium turns on the East Coast of the
United States. They might have their own systems under control. But
most businesses depend upon services and technology from other
countries as well. It's there that things get less certain.
</P>
<P>
   CNN, the global cable television network, will have its first
real taste of Y2K Friday morning. The new year comes to CNN's Hong
Kong bureau at 7 a.m. Eastern Standard Time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are as prepared as we can be,'' Hobbs said. ``We're as
confident as we can be within our four walls. I've read and seen
about the people who are very concerned about it,'' he said. ``But
most major companies have been working on this for a very long
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner spent between $125 million and $175 million patching
holes. Its subsidiary Turner Broadcasting System _ which includes
CNN, Headline News, TNT, TCM, the Cartoon Network and the Atlanta
Braves and Atlanta Hawks _ accounted for less than $17 million of
that.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner and Turner started on the project two years ago.
More than 200 people spent more than 90,000 hours on it.
</P>
<P>
   Hobbs, a 37-year-old Ft. Worth, Texas, native, is TBS's vice
president, controller and chief accounting officer. He is in charge
of financial reporting, budgeting _ not normally skills associated
with technology fixes. But Turner is known for its frugality. And
controllers monitor what people spend.
</P>
<P>
   First, TBS needed to know what it had that could possibly be
affected by the Y2K bug. That meant obvious things such as PCs and
laptops and software. But it also meant things whose technology
component was more subtle, including computer chips embedded in
cameras and other broadcast equipment.
</P>
<P>
   From there, Hobbs' group decided which of the items on the list
were required in order for TBS to do what it does: broadcast
television signals. TBS considered its payroll and billing and
regulatory systems to be similarly vital.
</P>
<P>
   The list of ``mission critical'' items numbered 70. As it turned
out, most of them _ such as cable head-end equipment, satellites
and satellite software _ were controlled by other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Hobbs and his group set about trying to contact the companies
involved. TBS mailed some 4,000 letters, followed up with phone
calls, talked to members of trade associations, read Securities and
Exchange Commission filings and scoured corporate Web sites looking
for information about a client's or vendor's Y2K readiness.
</P>
<P>
   TBS has spent the last few months finalizing its backup plans,
something with which the global channel has a bit of experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``CNN is so inventive and creative anyway with regard to
covering the news,'' he said. ``We're good at this. They think this
way naturally.''
</P>
<P>
   TBS will have a command center, six people working out of space
on the ground floor of CNN Center. All told, TBS will have 100 to
120 people working worldwide New Year's Eve. The Atlanta command
center will be outfitted with 10 conventional phone lines, six cell
phones and three satellite phones.
</P>
<P>
   Still, each executive responsible for Turner's Y2K preparation
will be in the Atlanta area that night, including Hobbs, who will
be a phone call away, watching CNN.

 &HT;    MindSpring changes plan, will open call centers
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ MindSpring Enterprises, the Midtown Atlanta-based
Internet service provider, is not worried about the Y2K bug.
</P>
<P>
   As late as mid-December, MindSpring was so confident about its
readiness for the changeover that it originally planned to close
its customer service call centers, as it does every year.
</P>
<P>
   However, earlier this week, the company that soon will become
the second-largest ISP following its merger with Pasadena,
Calif.-based EarthLink made a last-minute decision to have a
skeleton staff on call, beginning at about 11 p.m., to answer
questions from concerned subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Call centers in the Atlanta and Pasadena headquarters will be
closed. Calls to MindSpring will be handled by the centers in
Harrisburg, Pa., and Phoenix. Subscribers around the country with
questions or problems will be routed to one of these call centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's smaller than the normal staff of people,'' said Jonathan
Poore, who heads up MindSpring's Y2K efforts. ``But we want people
to know we are there. We thought about it, and we decided it was
the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Poore says there isn't much for Internet users to worry about.
``Really, if the power stays on and the phone stays on, we are in
good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring and Poore have adopted a unique approach to the Y2K
problem, which Poore says isn't a problem if you think about it
carefully enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to put this in a good way, and you can apply this all
across the industry. It's not like putting a new product out. With
Y2K, you are really working hard to make sure nothing happens.''
Like the old ``Seinfeld'' TV series, Poore views his Y2K chores as
``a project about nothing'' _ not so much repairing things as
making sure nothing breaks on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to sell to people,'' Poore says, referring to the
Y2K hoopla swirling around him and the resulting hysteria to which
MindSpring seems oblivious. ``But we are ready to go, we've
assessed everything, we've tested everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Poore and an outside consulting group have been working on Y2K
readiness since 1998. ``The consulting group came in to help with
some of the project managment, because the Y2K project is so large.
It touches almost every part of the organization.''
</P>
<P>
   In November 1998, the company did its first assessment of the
ISP's readiness for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Poore and MindSpring took a look at ``everything in the company
that had a chip in it,'' from the fax machines to the mail servers
to the computers sitting on desks in the administrative offices.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring says its 1.3 million members will be able to send and
receive millennium e-mail, surf the Web, work on their home pages
and pretty much do everything they normally do. That is, unless the
electricity or the phone lines go down.
</P>
<P>
   Making sure of all the companies that enable MindSpring to
provide Internet access was the most critical task of all,
according to Poole. ``This is a biggie,'' he says. ``MindSpring
doesn't operate in a vacuum. There are around 30 critical vendors
we rely on. We had to meet with each of them them to determine if
they were Y2K-compliant and how far along they were.'' Poore says
the critical vendor assessment began in March and wrapped up a few
weeks before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   In MindSpring's Y2K disclosure statement to stockholders, the
company said it spent approximately $600,000 as of Nov. 10.
Expenses for the rest of the year are expected to be minimal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted to make sure they were all following the same
sort of programs,'' he says. ``There's sort of an industry standard
that's evolved. It was a tedious process and a time-consuming
process early on. It required more planning than actual work. We
tested everything,'' he says, but adds, ``there is a limit, though,
to how much we can test in terms of mission-critical stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We evaluated our contingency plans when we have had disasters.
We've had minor disasters before, and we've managed them. There's
nothing that Y2K can do that we can't handle. We have people on
call, and we'll be ready for it. If something happens internally,
we'll have people here to fix it.''

 &HT;    Southern Co. plan years in making
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Mike McClure was tapped to be Southern Co.'s Y2K
czar more than three years ago, he wasn't so sure he was getting a
full-time job.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started, I thought I needed something else,'' says
McClure, a 30-year Southern Co. veteran. ``It's ended up being 60
to 70 hours a week.''
</P>
<P>
   McClure has overseen an $87 million budget and staff of 25 to
make sure the Atlanta-based utility company and its subsidiaries
worldwide, including Georgia Power Co., will be ready New Year's
Eve when the clocks move forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We checked over 10,000 devices and types of items,'' McClure
said. Fixes have been made, and many Southern power plants were
turned ahead to the new year months ago to make sure there will be
no New Year surprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the largest non-construction projects we've
ever done,'' said McClure. The effort ``has not required rocket
science,'' just organizing a task that has involved more than 600
people company-wide. McClure said the exercize has been useful for
Southern beyond Y2K preparedness, because the company now has
conducted a company-wide inventory of equipment ``that has helped
us prioritize the most critical things for putting the lights on.''
</P>
<P>
   McClure is in a unique position to understand how all the moving
parts at Southern fit together, but his next posting is not known.
McClure is a Georgia native who received a bachelor's degree from
the University of Georgia and a master's at Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   He was vice president of information services at Southern
Company Services before neing named Millennium Project Executive in
September 1996. But his old job doesn't exist following a
reorganization conducted in his absence.
</P>
<P>
   He'll talk to his bosses in January about what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he will now get to spend more time with his
family, he said, ``I think I still have a family.''

 &HT;    Sanks keeps fumbles in perspective
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Jasper Sanks has had a solid sophomore season.
</P>
<P>
   He is Georgia's top rusher with 896 yards, leads the team with
six rushing touchdowns and has rushed for at least 130 yards in
three consecutive game.
</P>
<P>
   But Sanks won't be remembered for that. No, he will be
remembered for ``the fumbles.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Sanks who was carrying the ball on the much-disputed and
now-infamous fumble call in the final seconds against Georgia Tech.
And against Florida, it was Sanks who coughed up the ball when
Georgia was driving for the potential go-ahead score in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs went on to lose both games to their rivals, and
Sanks was left to field the painful questions afterward.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of players would have been devastated to play such a
central role in a team's demise. But life has gone on for the 6-0,
226-pounder from Columbus. He said he doesn't see himself as a
sympathetic figure and neither should anybody else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't let it get to me,'' Sanks said. ``I've worked too
hard to get to this point, and I'm not going to forget about all
the good things that have happened just because of something like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia coach Jim Donnan said he is impressed by _ and
appreciative of _ Sanks' attitude in the face of adversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing you can do about it,'' Donnan said.
``(Mistakes) happen to everybody in life, regardless of whether
you're playing football or not. If you dwell on it, you're going to
drive yourself into oblivion with misery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of those plays affected our season, there's no question
about it,'' Donnan said. ``Purdue had shots at the end zone against
Penn State that they'd like to have over, too, I guarantee you. But
you don't get them over.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanks, a consensus All-American at Carver High School, has had
to overcome a lot to establish a collegiate career. He was an
initial non-qualifier, had to spend a year at Fork Union Military
Academy in Virginia, battled a weight problem and injury his
freshman year, then had to play his way into the lineup this
season.
</P>
<P>
   But heading into Georgia's Outback Bowl date against Purdue on
Saturday, Sanks is the Bulldogs' undisputed No. 1 ball carrier. He
averages 81.5 yards a game in a pass-oriented offense and, at
times, has proved himself as the most dominant force in a game. He
posted six games of 80 or more yards rushing, including a
season-high 156 yards on 27 carries against LSU.
</P>
<P>
   Two Georgia running backs have rushed for more yards as
sophomores than Sanks, Herschel Walker, with an SEC-record 1,891
yards in 1981 and Garrison Hearst with 968 yards in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   But Sanks wanted even more this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal in the back of my mind was to rush for 1,000 yards,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sanks won't deny replaying the two ill-fated plays over again in
his mind. Of the play against Florida, which happened at the
Gators' 13-yard line, he says he got reckless in protecting the
football while trying to forge ahead.
</P>
<P>
   And he said he has regrets about the play against Georgia Tech,
even though replays showed he was down before the ball popped loose
at the Yellow Jackets' 1-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, I wish I could have wrapped it up a little better,
even though it was a bad call,'' Sanks said. ``But this whole year
has been a learning process for me.''
</P>
<P>
   As a freshman last year, Sanks had 10 carries for 65 yards. This
year, he has averaged 5.1 yards on 177 carries.
</P>
<P>
   Sanks said he hopes he will have a chance for redemption against
the Boilermakers, who feature a high-flying offense led by
quarterback Drew Brees that averages more than 450 yards a game.
One way to contain such an offense is to keep the ball away from
it.
</P>
<P>
   Sanks said he can help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think so,'' he said. ``We've been working on our running
game an awful lot. I'll do anything I can to help.''
</P>
<P>
   As for exorcising demons Sanks insists that he has none to
chase.

U.S. BACKS AWAY FROM BID TO CUT OFF AID TO RUSSIA
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States will not seek to block economic
aid to Russia as punishment for that country's widely condemned
campaign against separatist rebels in Chechnya, a Clinton
administration official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The official, speaking after Russia won the release Tuesday of a
$100 million loan from the World Bank, said that aid packages to
Russia from the United States, the World Bank or its sister agency,
the International Monetary Fund, would be considered on a
case-by-case basis. But he said that the Clinton administration
would not apply an umbrella political standard when reviewing aid
programs and has no plans to cut off aid in general as a way of
punishing Russia for its military campaign in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``We support this disbursement of funds, which will be used to
restructure the coal sector,'' said the official, who declined to
be identified by name. ``It is fully consistent with the common
objective of promoting market reforms in Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank loan released Tuesday to help Russia restructure
its coal industry did not require the formal approval of the United
States. But Washington often uses its influence at the bank and the
International Monetary Fund to block loans that it considers
contrary to its national interest.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the administration sent a different signal when
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright ordered the Export-Import
Bank to reject a $500 million loan for Russia. Albright cited
concerns about the Russian state-affiliated oil company that would
have received the money and State Department officials said the
decision had nothing to do with Chechnya. But other administration
officials suggested at the time that the Chechnya conflict had
heightened the political sensitivity of economic cooperation with
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The approval of aid from the World Bank immediately raised
Russian hopes that the United States would not block a much larger
aid package from the monetary fund. The fund must decide whether to
release $640 million to Russia that it delayed in September, citing
Russia's failure to meet certain conditions of the loan. A decision
on whether Russia has met those conditions could come as soon as
next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is good news, a good event. The World Bank has grasped
positively what is happening in the Russian economy,'' Alexander
Livshits, a senior Russia economic envoy, said Tuesday on Moscow
television. ``I think this is not the last good news.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said they did not intend to
signal that their support for World Bank loans would necessarily
carry over to aid from the monetary fund, which is designed to help
Russia pay back earlier loans it has received from international
agencies. But they said that the United States was not applying a
political litmus test to economic aid and that the administration
would continue to pursue its broad economic objectives in Russia
despite the Chechnya campaign.
</P>
<P>
   What the war in Chechnya has done, one administration official
said, was to make the United States reluctant to approve any new
loan disbursements if Russia had not strictly adhered to the terms
of using previous aid. In other words, Russia is not going to get
much latitude in the way it uses aid, but could still see a steady
flow of foreign loans as long as it uses them properly.
</P>
<P>
   Russia had fully met the conditions of previous World Bank loans
to its coal industry, and therefore the bank and the United States
had no grounds to hold up aid, officials at the bank and the
Clinton administration said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The World Bank loan will mean little to the Russian economy or
the country's ability to wage war against Chechen separatists. The
money is earmarked exclusively to ``cushion the impact'' of mass
layoffs in the coal industry. Russia has agreed to close 116
inefficient mines as a condition of receiving the aid.
</P>
<P>
   But the loan is still an important symbol for the Russian
government, which has been working to show that its economic
relations with the outside world are still on track despite
international condemnation of its military actions in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, whose centrist political party
did well in Russia's recent parliamentary elections, has promised
to jump-start economic reforms advocated by the West even as he
leads the uncompromising military effort. His party includes a
number of politicians who say they would like to speed up efforts
to remake Russia's economy in the Western mold, changes that came
to a standstill when Russia devalued its currency and defaulted on
some of its debt in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has also been eager to show that
economic engagement with Russia, a broad policy of helping Russia
manage its economy and its finances, has paid dividends despite an
increasingly strained relationship with Moscow over geopolitical
issues. Officials said that cutting off aid to Russia now makes no
sense, given that politicians who favor economic changes are
ascendant and that Russian markets have begun to recover from the
sharp reversal they suffered last year.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups criticized the World Bank's decision to
release the loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seriously disappointed by the Bank's decision,'' Holly
Cartner, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and
Central Asia Division, said in a statement. ``The Bank's stated
commitment to addressing the `human aspects' of development rings
hollow when its funds are paid directly to a government pursuing
the kind of abusive campaign we are witnessing in Chechnya.''
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank staff considered the Chechnya conflict when
reviewing whether to release the aid, according to a bank
spokeswoman, Gina Ciagne. But that review focused solely on the
financial impact _ whether the war effort would so deplete Russia's
financial resources and scare away investors that the country would
have a hard time paying back the loans, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Long term, the war could have that effect, Ms. Ciagne said in
describing the conclusion of the World Bank review. But it did not
threaten to do so now.
</P>
<P>
   She said the bank was legally obligated to disburse the money
agreed to in the 1997 coal-sector reform package, provided that
Russia met the conditions of the loan.

 By JEROME SOLOMON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
IRVING _ Before they put an end to the longest football season in
school history, the Texas Longhorns have one game left. But despite
Saturday's matchup with old rival Arkansas in the Cotton Bowl, most
Texas fans can't help but peek into the future, i.e., the 2000
season.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Longhorns will lose one lineman, a fullback and a receiver
on offense but will return everyone else from the starting unit,
including an all-conference quarterback who will be throwing to his
favorite target, the conference's record holder for receptions in a
single season.
</P>
<P>
   The defense will lose two starting ends but return the remaining
nine starters, including the best inside tandem in college
football.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in a favorable schedule that drops Top 10 teams Nebraska
and Kansas State, and fans can see the future is bright, and dreams
of a national championship are real.
</P>
<P>
   But the future may not be as bright as it looks.
</P>
<P>
   Players' dreams of turning professional are real as well, and
the lure of the dollar could persuade a few UT underclassmen to
make an early move to the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   The four Longhorns most often mentioned as capable of making the
jump are all juniors _ flanker Kwame Cavil, defensive tackles Casey
Hampton and Shaun Rogers, and offensive tackle Leonard Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for Texas fans: Rogers and Davis said this week
they would return to play out their eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm finished; this is it,'' Hampton said. ``I've already told
the coaches. This is my last game.''
</P>
<P>
   But after a rather lengthy pause
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah, I'm just playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a joke now, maybe, but the pronounced ``whew!'' from
Longhorns fans may be short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton dominated from the first game this season, earning
first-team All-America honors from the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old Galveston native took a medical redshirt year
after being injured in the third game of the 1997 season. His
return in 1998 was not spectacular early on, but he showed signs of
rounding into form.
</P>
<P>
   Fully recovered this year, Hampton led Texas in tackles,
becoming the first tackle in 13 years and just the third lineman in
school history to do so. At 6-1 and 305 pounds, he has the strength
and, just as important, the temperament to battle inside at the
next level.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton, who if he returned next season would be a favorite to
win the Lombardi Award, says now is not the time for him to talk
about the possibility of Arkansas being his last collegiate
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see, but I don't really want to talk about it,'' Hampton
said. ``It's something I'll discuss with the coaches when the time
comes. I want them to know if (I were to leave) they would be the
first to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Hampton, Cavil is not sure what his decision will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I will do,'' Cavil said. ``I have to weigh
my options after the Cotton Bowl and see what the deal is. I don't
really know yet. It'll be a tough decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-2, 205-pound Waco native has the size NFL teams love at
receiver, and he has shown a willingness to go across the middle
and the toughness to make catches in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Since moving from linebacker to wideout in his first season,
Cavil has looked like a natural at the position. Throughout the
season, Texas coach Mack Brown has raved that the 20-year-old Cavil
was playing as well as any receiver in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Cavil set school and Big 12 records for receptions (100) and
receiving yards (1,188) this season and was tabbed a second-team
All-American by the AP. He was a semifinalist for the Biletnikoff
Award, which goes to the nation's top receiver.
</P>
<P>
   He may have established himself as one of the best receivers in
the country, but that doesn't always translate into prime NFL draft
position. Cavil said where he is projected to be picked in the
draft will weigh heavily in his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess money is a big factor _ how much money I'll be able to
get this year, compared to next year,'' he added. ``Once I get all
the information, then I'll decide those kinds of things.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be real tough, because I love these guys and we have a
special bond together.''
</P>
<P>
   Cavil did say that what former teammate Ricky Williams
accomplished in his senior season, winning the Heisman Trophy,
gives him food for thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Playing in the NFL is) a dream, but Ricky had a chance to get
his cake and eat it, too, and I would love to be able to do that as
well,'' Cavil said.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers had a breakout season for Texas, showing for the first
time the ability to be as strong late in games as he is in the
early going. A fixture in opponents' backfields, Rogers finished
fourth on the team in tackles and posted the second-highest number
of tackles for losses in a season in school history.
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday's Cotton Bowl news conference, Texas defensive
coordinator Carl Reese said Rogers is the most talented player on
the Longhorns' defensive line. But the 20-year-old from La Porte,
who was voted UT's most improved defender by his teammates, said
now is not the time for him to turn pro.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not ready for the next level,'' said Rogers, whose dad,
Ernie, was drafted by the Dallas Cowboys and played in the Canadian
Football League and United States Football League. ``There are a
lot of things I have to learn. It's a great compliment to me that
there is even thought of me making the jump, but I'm not ready for
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about it some, but the cons outweigh the pros at
this time. It's more about maturity than physical ability and
talent. I need to make sure I get my maturity and my work ethic
where they need to be, because up there you don't get any second
chances. When I go, I want to be there for a while, so I'd better
get ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis echoed those sentiments, saying he knows he has what it
takes to play in the NFL but that he's not as ready now as he will
be after next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I compare this year to last year, and I've improved so much,''
Davis said. ``Even during the season I've gotten better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most guys my size (6-6, 355 pounds) can't move that well. I
can pass block and run block, but most guys my size can do one or
the other. I feel I can do both, but I'll do them even better next
year. So I'm staying.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleve Bryant, Texas' assistant athletic director for football
operations, says a program loaded with talented players is always
going to face their being tempted to leave early. But one positive
can be gleaned thus far.
</P>
<P>
   ``As yet, no one has made any contacts with me, saying, `Contact
the NFL, and see where I'm at,''' Bryant said. ``So far it's been
zero.''

<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ As more than 150 hostages faced a fifth
claustrophobic night of captivity on board an Indian Airlines jet,
the hijackers ratcheted up the pressure on the Indian government by
demanding that India pay them $200 million and release 35 jailed
militants, India's foreign minister, Jaswant Singh, said on Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the hijackers pose these new demands on Tuesday,
but they continued to reject India's request that women and
children be allowed to leave the plane being held at the airport in
Kandahar, Afghanistan, Singh said. He was cryptic about India's
response to the latest demands, though India is clearly concerned
that giving in would encourage further terrorist acts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let the country and the international community reflect on
these demands,'' he said Tuesday night, after a Cabinet meeting
called by Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the clamor from distraught relatives of the
hostages, most of whom are Indian citizens, has grown for the
government to take decisive action to end the crisis. Their
anxieties were aggravated on Tuesday when the jetliner's power
supply went dead for 12 hours, leaving the passengers to breathe
stale, unventilated air until an Indian engineer repaired the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   There were reports that the highjackers permitted guards from
the Taliban militia, which controls most of Afghanistan, to open
pipes of the plane's toilets to the outside and to run a tube into
the plane to help draw in fresh air. The Taliban have also been
supplying food and water to the plane's occupants.
</P>
<P>
   In Geneva, the International Committee of the Red Cross said it
had sent a medical team t the airport and had distributed medicine
to the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   The hijackers' new list of demands also included return of the
body of Sajjid Afghani, a militant opposed to Indian rule of
Kashmir who was killed by Indian security forces earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The hijackers' only previously known demand had been for the
release of the Pakistani Muslim cleric, Maulana Masood Azhar. Both
Azhar and Afghani were active in the militant group, Harkat
ul-Ansar, and had been arrested in 1994 and imprisoned in the
Indian-held portion of the Himalayan territory of Kashmir. Afghani
was killed earlier this year during what Indian authorities said
was a failed jailbreak.
</P>
<P>
   The identities of the hijackers themselves remained unclear, but
from their demands they appear to violently oppose secular, but
predominantly Hindu India's rule of the predominantly Muslim
territory of Kashmir and favor either a separate Kashmiri state or
a United Nations-sponsored plebiscite that would allow Kashmir to
join Islamic Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on Tuesday, Singh said the hijackers owe
their allegiance to Harkat ul-Ansar, which he described as a
terrorist organization founded and nurtured in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Indian officials held their second day of negotiations on
Tuesday with the hijackers over a cockpit radio in Kandahar, where
the plane landed after first flying from Nepal, to India, to
Pakistan and then to the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen seized control of the plane on Friday after it took
off on a scheduled flight from Katmandu, the capital of Nepal, to
New Delhi. Indian authorities have been harshly criticized by some
commentators for allowing the plane to leave Amritsar in northern
India for Lahore, Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban, a fundamentalist Muslim militia that has been
seeking international recognition as Afghanistan's government, has
gone to great lengths to distance itself from the hijackers. Its
officials have vowed not only that they will not give safe harbor
to the hijackers, but that they will storm the plane if the
hijackers begin killing hostages again.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban had wanted the United Nations to negotiate with the
hijackers, but India insisted that its own representatives handle
the talks, U.N. officials confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   The hijackers have already fatally stabbed one hostage. On
Sunday, they unloaded the murdered man's body and released 27
captives, most of them women and children, during a stop over in
Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban foreign minister, Abdul Wakil Muttawakil, said at a
news conference on Tuesday that the direct negotiations between
Indian officials and the hijackers had as yet yielded little that
is encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   ``The talks are in medium condition,'' he said. ``No progress
has been made so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Though India has no diplomatic relations with the Taliban, Singh
praised Taliban authorities for fully cooperating with Indian
negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   While the crisis dragged on, it was not the longest-lasting
hijacking episode. On July 23, 1968, members of the Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine diverted an Israeli flight from
Rome to Tel Aviv and then Algiers, releasing the last hostages 40
days later.

 &HT;    New Year's viruses lurk behind Y2K
 &HT;    By Heather Cocks
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ As the year 2000 looms large in the eyes of
nervous computer users, cybercriminals have been quietly working to
turn one potentially explosive time bomb into a virtual minefield.
</P>
<P>
   As early as September, computer virus writers slowly started
circulating an army of bugs through computer systems worldwide,
programming some of them to lurk dormant on machines until Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The virus programs range from innocuous little irritants to
fairly serious threats, and they exist to confound users who
probably can't distinguish a nagging virus from actual crashes
related to the Y2K bug, in which computers can't distinguish the
year 2000 from the year 1900.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is, they will target consumers because they're the
ones likely to be less prepared or immature about what to do,''
said Vincent Weafer, director of anti-virus software maker Symantec
Corp.'s research center. ``The real danger is misinformation and
people not knowing if a malfunction is real and severe.''
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, avoiding virus-related computer problems is
relatively simple. Experts say first to avoid suspicious e-mails
and software programs that may contain viruses and to check
suspicious e-mails with anti-virus programs. Some software makers
also have downloadable patches that can stave off viruses and fix
virus-related problems.
</P>
<P>
   This final virus frenzy caps a year in which computer viruses
wrought high-profile havoc. Melissa, Chernobyl and Worm.ExploreZip
top the list of now-infamous viruses that surfaced in 1999,
disrupting corporate e-mail servers nationwide and in some cases
wiping out data.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the final stretch, researchers have detected a dozen
viruses known to be Y2K-specific, though some estimates forecast as
many as 30,000 different viruses could activate with the date
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dealing with what's effectively a criminal underworld,
so predictions as to what they might be planning to do are very
difficult to make,'' said Andy Kite, an analyst with research
company GartnerGroup Inc. ``It's like predicting how many bank
robberies there will be next month.''
</P>
<P>
   As a precaution, the University of Texas at Austin plans to shut
down any nonessential machines, such as those in the student
computer labs, which will already be closed through the holidays,
according to G. Morgan Watkins, associate director of UT's Academic
Computing and Instructional Technology Services.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at some local companies say they trust the anti-virus
solutions they have in place, but declined to be named in case
their confidence piqued the curiosity of ambitious hackers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Businesses have to be very careful,'' Kite said. ``Those
earlier viruses did a lot of damage, costing (some) companies
millions of dollars in lost business. They don't want to be
infected.''
</P>
<P>
   A few so-called Trojan horse viruses are grabbing the most
attention. Much like its historical namesake, a Trojan horse virus
arrives as a file that seems innocent at first but executes a
malicious task when opened.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2KCount virus, for instance, masquerades as a New Year's
Eve countdown program from Microsoft Corp. Another, Babylonia,
disguises itself as a help file. One hybrid Trojan horse and
computer worm _ defined as a self-triggering virus program _ called
Fix2001 tries to trick users into thinking it's a Y2K readiness
check.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents at the National Infrastructure Protection Center
plan to stand watch for problematic Y2K viruses or any malicious
computer break-ins, the FBI said earlier this month. Some
anti-virus software makers like Symantec plan to watch Asia closely
when midnight hits there, and hope to be able to distribute fixes
globally before viruses they see there sweep across the time zones.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite the anticipated influx of viruses, both Weafer
and Kite said people who paid attention during the year's other
outbreaks should be well-positioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should just be careful and be aware,'' Weafer said.
``And keep in mind it's bad to get overexcited and do something
drastic like being afraid to use the machine at all.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years ago, teens raised the Titanic. In 1999, they raised
the roof _ and the stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Not only were the Backstreet Boys the top-selling act of this
premillennial year with a sophomore album, ``Millennium,'' that
moved more than 10 million units, a new crop of teen stars came
along to rake in the dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Next to boy-bands like Backstreet, 'N Sync and 98 Degrees,
generic teen females _ including Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera
and Jessica Simpson _ scored strong showings in the last 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, nearly the same thing was happening in modern rock.
Faceless groups such as Lit and Blink-182 hit big and instantly
evaporated, while the rap-metal genre spearheaded by Limp Bizkit,
Kid Rock and Korn continued to draw fans.
</P>
<P>
   If you were old-school, the biggest events of the year were the
Bruce Springsteen &AMP; the E Street Band reunion tour and the
unexpected comeback of Santana.
</P>
<P>
   Still, others appreciated the strong showing of Latin pop as
Ricky Martin, Jennifer Lopez, Marc Anthony and Enrique Iglesias
demonstrated crossover dreams.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't a year like 1998, when ``The Miseducation of
Lauryn Hill'' was a clear favorite. The closest we saw to an
across-the-board hit in '99 was guitarist Carlos Santana's
``Supernatural,'' which spent three weeks at No. 1 and did better
than any Santana album in nearly 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   It helped that the album was fueled by ``Smooth,'' the
compelling smash single featuring Matchbox 20's convincing Rob
Thomas on vocals.
</P>
<P>
   Other much-heralded comebacks included the Eurythmics, TLC,
Cher, Whitney Houston, Dr. Dre and Crosby, Stills, Nash &AMP; Young,
whose first album in 25 years was almost universally ignored.
</P>
<P>
   On stage, the Rolling Stones were the highest-grossing musical
act of 1999, selling more than $89.2 million in tickets. Meanwhile,
the first leg of the Springsteen reunion raked in more than $53
million from 44 shows. 'N Sync topped the list of newer acts,
grossing $44.3 million from 107 shows.
</P>
<P>
   In country, the once-mighty Garth Brooks miscalculated when he
took on the fictional persona of Chris Gaines, but fans were
apparently too enamored of newcomers like the Dixie Chicks and
superstar acts Shania Twain and Faith Hill to take much notice.
</P>
<P>
   Female hip-hop continued to dominate the charts. Girl acts such
as Destiny's Child, TLC, Missy Elliott, Mary J. Blige, Foxy Brown
and Hill ruled in '99, even as one-off rap acts such as Mystikal,
Silkk the Shocker, C-Murder, Eminem, Fiend and others logged time
at No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   And Wu-Tang Clan rapper Russell Jones, better-known as either
Big Baby Jesus or Ol' Dirty Bastard, started the year with a bang
by exchanging shots with New York police and ended it in crack
rehab.
</P>
<P>
   Jazz was best represented by pianist Keith Jarrett's inspiring
``The Melody at Night, With You,'' a single disc that resonated
loudly, even as Columbia insanely issued no less than 15 albums by
Wynton Marsalis in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the music business itself was hit hard as a result of
Seagram's $10 billion-plus acquisition of PolyGram a year earlier.
Some 500 employees were furloughed; 170 of 200 people at A&AMP;M and
110 at Geffen were pink-slipped.
</P>
<P>
   And an executive-suite power struggle became public when Arista
president Clive Davis clashed with BMG Entertainment president/CEO
Strauss Zelnick over the future of Arista.
</P>
<P>
   In records, there was a spate of good albums this year,
including ``Cruel Moon,'' Buddy Miller; ``Cold Hard Truth,'' George
Jones; ``Live in Texas,'' Lyle Lovett; ``Life Is a Carnival,'' Wild
Magnolias; ``Warm Cool: The Atlantic Years,'' Chris Connor; ``From
Here to Eternity Live,'' the Clash; ``Jim Hall &AMP; Pat Metheny,'' Jim
Hall and Pat Metheny; ``This Time,'' Los Lobos; ``Fly,'' Dixie
Chicks; ``She Haunts My Dreams,'' Spain; ``The Contino Sessions,''
Death in Vegas; ``Close Your Eyes,'' Dot Allison; and ``Tiempos,''
Ruben Blades.
</P>
<P>
   And, as always, the Grim Reaper had a busy year, taking jazz
pianist Michel Petrucciani, blues vocalist Charles Brown, ``Route
66'' writer Bobby Troup, jazz pianist Jaki Byard, Troubadour owner
Doug Weston, rockabilly legend Buddy Knox, reggae great Augustus
Pablo, reggae artist Junior Braithwaite, reggae act Mikey Wallace,
treasured Los Angeles jazz pianist Horace Tapscott, pop diva Dusty
Springfield, bluesman Lowell Fulson, blues guitarist ``Mighty Joe''

WITH POLITICS AND PRANKS, MEXICO PASSES $128 BILLION BUDGET
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ After weeks of alternately fierce and farcical
debate that left many lawmakers with a sour aftertaste, Mexico's
Congress passed next year's $128 billion federal budget Tuesday,
averting a year-end government shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   Approving the budget has become the annual test of the efficacy
of the young democratic congress, where the opposition seized a
majority in 1997 from the Institutional Revolutionary Party, PRI,
which had controlled it for seven decades. This year the lower
legislative house, the Chamber of Deputies, managed once again to
pull out a budget before the Dec. 31 deadline, but the battle left
all parties bruised.
</P>
<P>
   The lower house, which approves the budget by itself, maintained
the essential discipline of President Ernesto Zedillo's original
proposal, with goals of 10 percent inflation, at least 4 percent
growth and a federal deficit equivalent to 1 percent of gross
domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   But along the way the decorum often collapsed. At one point the
deliberations were interrupted by a dozen protesters from a
debtors' organization mounted on quarter horses, who charged
through the fence surrounding the legislative building and trotted
to the doors of the plenary hall. The debtors' group is backed by
the main left-of-center opposition party.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition legislators poured glue into the electronic voting
button of one member of their ranks who unexpectedly sided with the
government in a crucial ballot. Another opposition deputy issued an
``apology to the nation'' after he had one drink too many, by his
own admission, and snoozed through the same vote.
</P>
<P>
   The debate was largely overshadowed by the parties' maneuvering
to gain the favor of voters in advance of the presidential election
in July 2000, and the technical details of the budget were pushed
to the background.
</P>
<P>
   With the governing party and the opposition in a virtual tie,
political jockeying was dominated for the first time by the
legislature's smallest parties, the Green Party, with five votes of
500, and the Labor Party, with 13 votes. From one day to the next,
it was unclear which side those parties were on. Each broke with
previously formed opposition alliances to side with the government,
then under pressure switched back to the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The continual bickering slowed down the Congress' lawmaking.
According to figures published Tuesday in the daily newspaper
Reforma, in 1997 legislators voted on 43 percent of bills before
them, while this year they took action on only 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The main sticking point was how much money to allot to the
agency that oversees the huge bank bailout, whose $72 billion debt
amounts to a third of all of Mexico's public debt.
</P>
<P>
   One opposition party, the National Action Party, refused to
release all the funds to service the bailout agency's debts until
the agency agreed to identify all the borrowers involved with
illegal loans and other fraud. The party also demanded that the
governing party give back $5 million in loans that were spent on
Zedillo's presidential campaign and later went to the bailout.
Finance officials argued that the measure would restrict the
bailout agency's ability to raise money from international markets
to finance its debts. The opposition lost a separate ballot on the
issue by one vote. The agency will receive $3.6 billion to finance
its debts, as Zedillo proposed.

A BIT OF PATE? CHECK THE LABEL FIRST
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: N.J., N.Y., Md., Canada, Ga.)  (Eds.: With FOOD-RECALL-LIST)  
(jw) 
 By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A New Jersey company known for its high quality foods is
voluntarily recalling 26 of it prepared products, including foie
gras pates, mousses and terrines, and has forced the closing of the
Huntington, N.Y., plant that produced them because of possible
contamination with the sometimes deady bacterium, listeria
monocytogenes.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's recall is the third issued by the company, D'Artagnan,
since Dec. 17 when it learned that its truffled foie gras mousse,
which is sold in stores across the United States and Canada,
through catalogs and over the Internet, had made two people in
Maryland ill with listeriosis. There has been another confirmed
case in Maryland since then and two other cases in two other
states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Listeria does not pose much danger to most people but it is a
serious threat to the elderly, to pregnant women, to fetuses and
newborns and to those whose immune systems are compromised.
</P>
<P>
   The first recall, which took place Dec. 17, was for 17,600
pounds of the truffled mousse and peppercorn mousse. It was
expanded Dec. 23. The recall on Tuesday was for all of the 26
products that the plant has made since Nov. 1, about another 60,000
pounds of expensive items that range from smoked duck breast to
venison terrine. In addition, up to 10,000 pounds of food that had
never left the warehouse has been destroyed. The privately owned
company with $22 million in sales this year is still counting its
losses.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 22, D'Artagnan had told its contractor, Hannelore
Gourmet Foods Ltd., of Huntington, to stop production. ``I did not
feel confident,'' said Ariane Daguin, who owns the 15-year-old
company in Newark, N.J., with George Faison.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Hannelore, which does 90 percent of its business
with D'Artagnan, could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Daguin said she received a report this morning from the
laboratory she hired to investigate the problem that said the
source of the listeria was probably in the packaging process.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. I. Kay Wachsmuth, deputy administrator for the office of
public health and science in the Department of Agriculture's Food
Safety and Inspection Service, said that listeria was widespread in
the natural world and ``once it is inside a plant it's a bear to
get rid of,'' adding that recalling all the products from that
plant was ``very prudent.''
</P>
<P>
   This case illustrates the difficulties the Department of
Agriculture has with listeria, said Dr. Wachsmuth.
</P>
<P>
   She said that even with the Agriculture Department's new
science-based program to assure the safety of meat and poultry in
processing plants, ``we've had people who have had to take up
floors and replace them or completely take down machinery.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not sterile products,'' said Dr. Wachsmuth. She said
that irradiation, a process that sterilizes food but is not used
much in the United States, ``is going to have to play a role
here.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to notifying retailers and distributors about the
recall, the company also had to call people who had bought the
products from catalogs or on the Internet, either directly through
D'Artagnan or other sources.
</P>
<P>
   The recall comes at the busiest season of the year for producers
of these luxury products. A pound of mousse of foie gras with
truffles sells for about $60. Ms. Daguin said that the products
that had either been destroyed or recalled represented 30 percent
of the prepared food the company sold.
</P>
<P>
   None of D'Artagnan's fresh product line, which includes
everything from pheasant and wild boar to rabbits and uncooked foie
gras, is affected by this recall, nor are the company's sausages,
prosciutto and Bayonne ham, which are produced elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Other suppliers have already taken up the slack. ``They stuck us
with no pate on the biggest pate week of the year,'' said Andy
Arons, a partner in the four Gourmet Garages in New York. ``They
also do our private label pate. So we went to another vendor and
are paying a lot more because we have no relationship with this
one. There were maybe 1,000 units involved and it hurts. We are
discussing how to communicate to our customers why our pate is now
$2 more.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time Arons said he had ``nothing negative to say
about D'Artagnan because they are a superb company with a high
degree of integrity, and if they want to be careful and recall
everything it's the smartest way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   There had been few reports of contamination with listeria over
the last six years. In 1998, the Department of Agriculture
announced three recalls and in 1997, two. This year there have been
26, but officials are not certain whether there are actually more
contaminated products or better reporting. The incidence of
listeriosis has remained relatively stable _ about five per million
_ according to Dr. Paul Mead, a medical epidemiologist at the
Centers for Disease Control.
</P>
<P>
   It is now possible to fingerprint the DNA of bacteria and link
isolated cases in different parts of the country. Dr. Mead said
that less than 5 percent of listeria isolated from patients came
from the particular strain found in this case. ``Finding this
particular strain is an unusual event,'' said Dr. Mead, ``and
finding several people in several states that have had that pate
and finding it in a closed package of that pate makes a very strong
argument that it was the source of the infection.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the potential for serious illness, the Agriculture
Department urges consumers who have bought the product not to eat
it and return it to the store. The listeriosis mortality rate is
about 30 percent.

 &HT;    Internet drug sites hard to regulate; Clinton seeks new powers
to do so
 &HT;    By Andrew Park
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In Texas, 10 employees of the State Board of
Pharmacy handled 1,500 complaints last year _ problems ranging from
pharmacists who dispense the wrong drugs to those who drink on the
job.
</P>
<P>
   Five more State employees periodically inspect the state's 5,000
licensed pharmacies and a few more handle license renewal.
</P>
<P>
   With such a small staff, it's little wonder Texas and other
states have struggled to keep up with the business of selling
prescription drugs over the Internet, a fast-moving, hard-to-track
industry whose popularity is growing but whose dangers have alarmed
consumers, pharmacists and physicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with the Internet is that sure, we could go out
and look everyday to see what's out there, but sites pop up just
overnight,'' many outside the country, said Gay Dodson, the
pharmacy board's executive director. ``We just don't have the
personnel to spend a long time on the Internet searching for them.
Most of them we find about about by complaint.''
</P>
<P>
   In what could become the next battleground in the regulation of
the Internet, states may get some help from the feds.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, President Clinton proposed new powers for the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration to regulate online drug sales and penalize
``rogue operators'' that dispense prescriptions unethically or
illegally. Under the proposal, which still needs congressional
approval, the FDA would review and certify online pharmacies before
they could sell over the Internet and impose fines of up to
$500,000 for sites that sell without a prescription.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first attempt by the federal government to regulate
businesses that sell goods to consumers over the Internet, said
Washington, D.C., health care attorney Keith Korenchuck.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is extremely significant'' he said, because it is a tacit
acknowledgment by the White House that current state-by-state rules
can't keep up with the rapidly growing cyberspace health industry.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that run online pharmacies greeted the proposal with
mixed reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcome the oversight,'' said Roger Phillips, one of the
founders of Austin's Rx.com, which began selling prescription drugs
online in October. ``I think if anything it will encourage
consumers to use the Internet to obtain their prescription and
non-prescription products.''
</P>
<P>
   But the National Association of Chain Drug Stores issued a
statement opposing further regulation of pharmacies, saying that
state laws and attempts at self-policing will protect consumers,
such as a voluntary certification program established by the
National Association of Boards of Pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``An informed consumer who can identify rogue pharmacy operators
can be effective in eliminating illegal operators by not using
their services,'' said Craig Fuller, chief executive of the group,
whose membership includes major drug chains that have invested
heavily in online sites.
</P>
<P>
   Texas law requires all pharmacies that operate in the state to
register and pay a $154 fee. Pharmacies based elsewhere that ship
drugs into Texas are also required to be licensed, and pharmacies
that sell narcotics must also have approval from state and federal
law enforcement agencies. Major online pharmacies, such as Rx.com,
are licensed in all 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   Texas and other states can take action when online pharmacies
are thought to be breaking existing pharmacy rules, and so far,
Michigan and Illinois have filed suits against multiple companies.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas pharmacy board has investigated complaints about
companies that sell drugs online without a state license, without
requiring prescriptions and without requiring a face-to-face
encounter, but has yet to take action against a company.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a separate regulatory group, the State Board
of Medical Examiners, ruled that doctors could not prescribe drugs
without examining a patient in person. Doctors that do are subject
to disciplinary actions. In its only action so far, the board filed
a complaint against a San Antonio doctor who prescribed Viagra
online to 1,300 consumers who only had to fill out a questionnaire
and pay a fee on top of the price of the prescription.This isn't
the first time the online health business has caught the attention
of the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA has been investigating online drug sales for years. The
Federal Trade Commission is investigating the distinction between
content and advertising on all Internet sites. And the Department
of Health and Human Services discussing the best ways to ensure
privacy of medical records online.
</P>
<P>
   ``This clearly defines it as a national issue not just a state
issue,'' said Donald Hackett, chief executive of drkoop.com Inc.
and a member of an alliance of online health care companies that
are studying ethical standards for the industry, including rules
for Internet commerce.

GROWTH REMOVED FROM TIPPER GORE'S THYROID GLAND  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Tipper Gore, the wife of Vice President Al Gore,
underwent surgery Tuesday to remove a growth from her thyroid
gland, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
   Camille Johnson, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Gore, said doctors at
Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore removed the growth during
an operation that lasted an hour and a half. The growth, which Ms.
Johnston described as a nodule, will be tested to determine if it
is benign or cancerous. Those tests will take about a week. Thyroid
nodules are a common medical problem.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president accompanied his wife to Johns Hopkins
University hospital in Baltimore, where surgery was performed by
Dr. Robert Udelsman, chief of the Division of Surgical Oncology and
Endocrine Surgery at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Johnston declined to characterize the results of the
operation or Mrs. Gore's condition until after she is fully
recovered from anesthesia. Mrs. Gore was scheduled to remain in the
hospital overnight, and the vice president was expected to stay
with her. She is expected to be discharged on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors found the growth on Mrs. Gore's thyroid when she sought
treatment for a chronic pain in her neck that stemmed from an
``exercise-related'' injury, Ms. Johnston said. The spokeswoman
stressed that the vice president's wife was not suffering symptoms
from any disease of the thyroid like Graves' disease or goiter.
</P>
<P>
   Thyroid tumors account for more than 90 percent of all endocrine
malignancies and result in close to 60 percent of the deaths from
endocrine cancer. The incidence of thyroid cancer is 5.8 per
100,000 females, and 2.4 per 100,000 in males.  &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is a developer's dream: a nine-acre parcel along a
prime stretch of the East River, just south of the United Nations,
the kind of property that rarely comes on the market anymore in
real estate-crazed New York.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Consolidated Edison Co. is selling the site, which includes
a 99-year-old steam-generated power plant, one of the last vestiges
of Manhattan's industrial past. Two developers are locked in a
last-minute battle for the chance to demolish the power plant and
build up to five million square feet of luxury apartment towers and
office buildings. The price tag? A half-billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The property is more than twice the size of the Columbus Circle
development site at the southwest corner of Central Park, which was
sold last year for $345 million, but it is smaller than the
historic 12-acre Rockefeller Center complex. In a city where the
skyline is writ larger every year, the sale of such a rare piece of
land has already drawn not only the intense interest of developers,
but also of their inevitable combatants, community preservation
advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably the most important parcel left in New York
City,'' said Stephen M. Ross, the chairman of Related Cos., which
is developing the Columbus Circle site but lost out in the bidding
for the Con Ed parcels. ``And it should have a master plan for
development. The biggest problem in New York today is that there's
nothing else around.''
</P>
<P>
   Con Ed executives said that the company had not picked a buyer
for the four parcels along First Avenue, between 35th and 41st
Streets, that compose the nine acres. Real estate executives,
however, said that the Fisher real estate family, and its partners
_ Sheldon Solow, a developer, and the Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
investment bank _ appeared on Monday to be the winners of the hotly
contested, 14-month-long auction for the site.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday morning, Mortimer B. Zuckerman, the chairman of
Boston Properties, and his partners _ the developers Leonard Litwin
and Donald Zucker _unexpectedly made a slightly better offer,
setting off other another tense round of negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a winner yet,'' said Robert P. Stelben, the
treasurer of Con Ed, who oversaw the auction. ``We'll be talking a
little later this week and be able to tell you what's going on.
Anything other than that is premature.''
</P>
<P>
   Whichever developer wins, the deal will have to be approved by
Con Ed's board of directors. It will also take another month or two
to negotiate the final details of a contract.
</P>
<P>
   But once a developer is selected, the project faces myriad
obstacles before the first spade can go in the ground.
</P>
<P>
   For one, Con Ed has to obtain approval from the Public Service
Commission to demolish the huge Waterside Steam Plant, which sits
on the largest of the four parcels, between 38th and 40th Streets,
at the East River. To do that, the company has to enhance the
steam-generating capacity at its 14th Street plant, a process that
could take three years. The renovated plant is to have a larger
generating capacity than the two current plants together.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the properties must go though the city's
always contentious land use review process and an environmental
review before residential and commercial development is allowed in
the existing manufacturing site. One unknown is the extent of
environmental problems, possibly including asbestos removal, that
might emerge with the demolition of the power plant.
</P>
<P>
   Several bidders said that Joseph P. Rose, chairman of the city's
Planning Department, had indicated to them in private meetings that
the city would ultimately permit towers of up to 45 or 50 stories
for a development that is required to include green space and an
esplanade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rose's implicit statement was: No Donald Trumps,'' one bidder
said, in a reference to that developer's planned 72-story
residential tower at First Avenue and 48th Street, which provoked
protests because it will loom 300 feet over the United Nations.

 &HT;    Behind film's famed mouse roars literary powerhouse
 &HT;    By Paul Reid
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Word is little kids are loving the big
screen adaptation of ``Stuart Little.'' In an ideal world, kids
would file out of the theater asking moms and dads, Gosh, can I
read the original book? Who wrote the book? When? Tell me about . .
.
</P>
<P>
   E.B. White.
</P>
<P>
   One thing about E.B. White you can take to the bank: White, like
Charles Dickens, Lewis Carroll and C.S. Lewis knew how to plumb the
depths of a child's soul. His children's books are classics.
``Charlotte's Web,'' ``Stuart Little'' (written in 1945) and ``The
Trumpet of the Swan'' will make great movies only in the hands of
great movie producers.
</P>
<P>
   Today's producers of kids' movies plumb the depths of
sugar-coated touchy-feel-goodism, with an eye on their corporate
balance sheets. ``Old Yeller'' taught them 40 years ago you can't
go killing off lovable beasts in movieland if you hope to make a
financial killing. You can't ask kids to face the realities of
life, such as death. And you can't expect kids to understand
serious moral issues.
</P>
<P>
   But that's just what the great authors do. They entertain and
teach and do so without an ounce of baloney. They don't try to fool
or impress readers. All the greats know kids have noses for bad,
shallow, listless, pedantic and boring writing.
</P>
<P>
   And E.B. White is one of the greats. Ask any kid who has read
``Charlotte's Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, ask an adult who has read it. Or read White's
essays, poems and stories, because it's as an essayist that White
entered the pantheon of American letters. In fact, ask anybody who
writes anything, or teaches writing, English or literature, ask
them what single book on writing and grammar should sit next to a
writer's typewriter or word processor? The most likely response:
Strunk and White's Elements of Style. That's White, as in E.B.
</P>
<P>
   The book is short and to the point. An example: ``Rather, very,
little, pretty _ these are the leeches that infest the pond of
prose, sucking the blood of words.''
</P>
<P>
   White helped keep pristine the pond of American prose. Yet his
is not a marquee name.
</P>
<P>
   Elwyn Brooks White was born in 1899. His centennial, unlike
Ernest Hemingway's, passed this year with little notice. But
Hemingway was a believer in and practitioner of White's writing
philosophy: Keep it simple, keep it active, don't be afraid, don't
be cute. And, most important, be honest.
</P>
<P>
   White was an essayist who believed absolutely in the honest use
of honest language. He could, with a single word, mortally wound a
stupid argument. He could, within a paragraph, dismantle a bad case
of bad thinking, false knowledge, phony and pretentious polemics.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote for the New Yorker, Harper's, The Atlantic, and
published 19 books, including a bit of high humor called ``Is Sex
Necessary,'' co-written with James Thurber. ``Humor,'' said White,
``plays close to the big hot fire that is Truth, and sometimes the
reader feels the heat.''
</P>
<P>
   White was a humanist. That is, he believed in the power of the
human soul and mind, but he believed, too, that life and humanity
are unpredictable, often dangerous, but still beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   He was suspicious of claims that mankind would enjoy peace,
prosperity and a level playing field once all ``victims'' of all
social evils were properly identified, understood and sympathized
with. He would never allow good, pithy words such as tall, short,
fat, skinny and dumb to be gutted of meaning by the word police.
From ``Bedfellows,'' 1956: ``And so when I see the first faint
shadow of orthodoxy sweep across the sky, feel the first cold whiff
of its blinding fog steal in from sea, I tremble all over, as
though I had just seen an eagle go by, carrying a baby.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Bedfellows,'' he says half-truths engage his fancy: ``All
half-truths excite me. An attractive half-truth in bed with a man
can disturb him as deeply as a cracker crumb.''
</P>
<P>
   White was ``a civilized human being _ an order of man that has
always been distinguished for its rarity,'' according to the
citation given to White in 1970 by the American Academy of Arts and
Sciences, along with its gold medal for essay writing.
</P>
<P>
   His essays, like his children's books, are deceptive in their
simplicity. Kids like simplicity. Nobody likes duplicity. No murky
agenda lurks in White. He asks only that you work honestly at
improving the human condition.
</P>
<P>
   He often used animals to tell a human story, but his animal
creations _ Charlotte, Wilbur, Stuart Little, White's dog, Fred _
never denied the harsh reality of nature. They were not Romantics.
Charlotte knew her fate, knew Wilbur's, too. Stuart Little knows
cats will not only chase him but eat him. Life is tough.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Charlotte's Web,'' a baby fish is snagged by a spider web:
``Charlotte's cousin won. She wrapped the fish up, then she ate him
when she got good and ready. Spiders have to eat, the same as the
rest of us.''
</P>
<P>
   And after Charlotte rigs the state fair in favor of Wilbur, the
pig: ``Nobody, of the hundreds of people who had visited the Fair,
knew that a grey spider had played the most important role of all.
No one was with her when she died.''
</P>
<P>
   Hard lessons. No sugar coating. Kids love it.
</P>
<P>
   White was never anti-intellectual, never embraced a
neo-Romantic, back to nature's Golden Age, Noble Savage as
mankind's apex, point of view. You know, the sort of empty and
trendy stuff you see in university curricula and post-1985 Disney
movies. White's Charlotte is a true heroine, selfless and wise.
Contrast White's books with Disney's ``The Lion King'' and
``Pocahontas,'' lessons in political correctness disguised as
entertainment. White would not have allowed this to go unnoticed.
He would have slain the pretensions of moviedom and academe with
his criticisms.
</P>
<P>
   But he died in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   He worked in New York, lived in Maine, but spent parts of many
of his last years in the Florida Keys. Here's his take on the real
estate busts of the late '30s, from ``On a Florida Key,'' 1941. ``I
love Florida as much for the remains of her unfinished cities as
for the bright cabanas on the beaches. I love to prowl the dead
sidewalks that run off into live jungle, under the broiling sun of
noon, where the cabbage palms throw their spiny shade across the
stillborn streets and the creepers bind old curbstones in a fierce
sensual embrace and the mocking birds dwell in song upon the
remembered grandeur of real estate's purple hour.''
</P>
<P>
   In one memorable paragraph from that 1941 essay, he asks why
Floridians would add color to the orange crop. The oranges he
bought were stamped ``color added.'' Isn't an orange orange enough,
naturally? He rambles on a bit about this seemingly benign
question, then jabs the reader with his true intentions. White
Floridians want color added to their oranges, he says, but they
won't open theaters to their neighbors who, by God's grace, carry
more color in their skin than whites. It's vintage E.B. White, not
a sucker punch but a knockout punch. He comes at issues from the
flank, at flank speed. He demands answers.
</P>
<P>
   Just like Stuart Little demands answers to his questions. He's
small, but Big. He's a hero in miniature. He's smart, a Renaissance
mouse. He's wise, just like kids who love E.B. White because White
treats them like the human beings they are.
</P>
<P>
   So, when your child asks, who wrote Stuart Little, you can say,
a great man. If your child doesn't ask, ignite a conversation. E.B.
White would.

AMERICAN AIRLINES MECHANIC ARRESTED ON EXPLOSIVES CHARGE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JAMES PINKERTON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An American Airlines mechanic was charged Tuesday with
possession of bomb components that police found in his apartment
near Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Police also found a small arsenal of weapons, 1,500 rounds of
ammunition, bomb-making manuals and white supremacist literature.
</P>
<P>
   Police stressed that Jere Wayne Haney, 42, of Grapevine, Texas,
did not have any bombs completed or under construction and said the
mechanic did not appear to have any intended targets.
</P>
<P>
   Although Haney had literature from the Klu Klux Klan and the
Aryan Brotherhood in his apartment, police say they have not linked
him to any extremist group.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (detectives) came away with the feeling there was nothing
imminent, there seemed to be no target, and it didn't have to do
with Y2K,'' said Grapevine police Detective Bob Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had all this stuff, this white supremacist literature,
anti-government literature, all these manuals, but it was not like
he was building bombs or ready to use it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just in the early stages of trying to figure him out and
find out what he's all about,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   FBI special agent Marjorie Poche in Dallas said, ``We are
looking into his associates to see if there is something we should
be concerned with, but we don't know yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Haney was charged with possessing components of explosives, a
state felony carrying a punishment of from two to 10 years in
prison and a $10,000 fine, Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   Police found a 50-pound bag of ammonium nitrate fertilizer, fuse
cord, several other bomb-making supplies and manuals on how to use
those components to assemble a bomb with an explosive equivalent of
a ``case of dynamite,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would obviously produce a terrific explosion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Police who searched Haney's apartment at the Marina Del Rey
Apartments also found a small amount of marijuana, Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   Haney was arraigned Tuesday morning and released on $10,000
bail.
</P>
<P>
   Haney, who is single and a Kansas native, has several
misdemeanor marijuana arrests dating to 1995 that were dismissed
and one drunken driving conviction in September 1997, according to
records at the Tarrant County Clerk's office in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Haney's arrest came as a surprise to Fort Worth attorney Robert
Bush, who is defending him on a driving while intoxicated charge
filed earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I know, he's as normal as can be,'' said Bush. ``He
had a job out there and as far as I know he's just an everyday
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Agents with the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
seized 16 firearms found in Haney's apartment, including four
assault weapons and four semi-automatic handguns. They also seized
62 boxes of ammunition _ or 1,240 rounds _ for the assault rifles
and 300 to 500 assorted other rounds, Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   However, ATF agent Tom Crowley said the firearms all appeared to
be legal, adding that Haney's history of misdemeanor arrests would
not prohibit him from owning a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were legal weapons, and as far as we know he was not a
prohibited person _ he was not prohibited from possessing a
firearm,'' Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
   Haney was stopped Monday morning by DFW airport police after he
allegedly ran a stop sign on airport property. Police determined
Haney was driving with a suspended license and found 67 small
liquor bottles of the type sold by airlines in his 1984 Ram
Charger.
</P>
<P>
   Haney agreed to let police search his apartment to see if there
were more airline liquor bottles, and Grapevine police were called
in when the bomb-making components were found, Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   John Hotard, head of corporate communications for American
Airlines, said Haney has been suspended without pay and will face
disciplinary action for the alleged theft of the airline's liquor.
</P>
<P>
   According to a press release issued by the airline, Haney was
hired as an airplane mechanic at its DFW maintenance facility on
July 2, 1991, and his previous employment history includes ``steady
work'' as a mechanic with McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics.
Haney was honorably discharged from the U.S. Army in 1984, the
airline said.
</P>
<P>
   Airline officials said Haney had not experienced any problems
during his eight years of employment.

500 PEOPLE EVACUATED AS FIRE BURNS IN CALIFORNIA HILLS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA WHITAKER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ More than 500 people were evacuated early Tuesday
from their homes in Arcadia, 22 miles east of here, as a fire in
the Angeles National Forest burned out of control in the mountains
above town.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday night, fire officials said they were planning to
allow most residents to return home after containing about 40
percent of the blaze, which had destroyed at least 750 acres in the
San Gabriel Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   No homes were destroyed in the fire, which began about 2:45 p.m.
Monday in Santa Anita Canyon. Three of the nearly 1,000
firefighters attacking the blaze sustained minor injuries,
officials reported. Otherwise, no one was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Ketman, a spokesman for the U.S. Forest Service, said
efforts to fight the fire had been hampered by ``very, very steep
terrain.''
</P>
<P>
   Ketman said there had not been a fire in the area since 1969, so
there was plenty of vegetation to fuel the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   Although the high fire season typically ends in November, dry
weather has turned much of the region into a tinderbox, Ketman
said. Those conditions fueled a fire on Monday in Trabuco Canyon
near Mission Viejo, which burned 60 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a fire in the Los Padres National Forest in Ojai in
Ventura County burned more than 4,300 acres and destroyed a home.
Another fire last week in the La Canada-Flintridge and Glendale
area, north of downtown Los Angeles, destroyed 524 acres and
threatened homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just haven't had any rain this year,'' Ketman said.
</P>
<P>
   Three helicopters and four tanker planes were being used to
fight the Arcadia fire. While the authorities said they were in a
good position to keep the fire from houses, the big unknown factor
was the wind. High Santa Ana winds that blow in off the desert can
play havoc with efforts to contain a fire.
</P>
<P>
   As the fire grows, Ketman said, it can begin to produce its own
``weather,'' generating updrafts that keep it moving.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Okun, a volunteer with the San Gabriel Red Cross, said
that about 100 residents checked in at the Arcadia Community Center
on Monday night but that many moved on to stay with friends or
relatives. Only about 30 adults and 10 children remained at the
center this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Genevieve A. Green, a 28-year resident who left her home in the
mountains about 7:30 p.m. Monday, said she had no idea when she
would be allowed to return home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on the weather,'' Mrs. Green said early Tuesday by
telephone from the Arcadia Community Center, where the Red Cross
set up a temporary shelter. ``If a Santa Ana comes up, we're stuck
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Green said that she and her husband had seen the fire on
Monday as they returned home from the holidays but that officials
had told them not to worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went and took a nap,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But by 7:30, the police were at the door telling residents that
they should leave. At that point, Mrs. Green said, she looked
toward her backyard and could see ``a total wall of flames'' moving
toward her house.
</P>
<P>
   By 10 p.m., officials had begun forced evacuations. ``We
gathered all of our children's pictures and put them in the car,''
Mrs. Green said. ``It was very frightening.''

PAKISTANI MILITANT'S FREEDOM IS AT CENTER OF HIJACKERS' DEMANDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With INDIA-HIJACK) 
(rk) 
 By NEIL MacFARQUHAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Freedom for Masood Azhar, a Pakistani militant who recruited
young men to fight Indian control over the state of Kashmir, is the
one unvarying demand of the hijackers holding the Indian Airlines
plane and its passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Azhar, often referred to by the Muslim religious honorific of
Maulana, has been in Indian custody since he was arrested in
February 1994 in the embattled province. After the hijacking, local
press reports quoted a police official at the high-security jail
where he is held as saying Azhar was one of the most devout
prisoners, scrupulously following the Muslim practice of praying
five times a day.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his arrest, Azhar, now 31, was editing two
religious publications that among other things urged young men to
become fighters for causes like the Kashmir separatist movement. He
was known as a leader and spiritual guide in Harakat ul-Ansar, or
the Partisan Movement, which helped recruit, train and deploy
militants in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since his arrest, the group has changed its name to
Harakat ul-Mujahedeen, or the Fighters Movement. The exact division
of responsibility in these Muslim militant movements and their
relations with other, similarly motivated political groups is often
murky.
</P>
<P>
   Something as simple as their frequent name changes are rarely
explained publicly, but one reason in this case is believed to be
that in October 1997 the U.S. State Department included Harakat
ul-Ansar on a list of about 30 groups worldwide it considers
sponsors of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department report on terrorism for 1998 said the group
operated training camps in eastern Afghanistan and claims that some
of its fighters were killed in the strikes on camps in Afghanistan
used by Osama bin Laden in August 1998. The United States made the
strikes in retaliation for the alleged involvement of bin Laden's
organization in the bombings of the American Embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania on Aug. 7, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The various Islamic groups in the region are believed to share
the logistics, costs and trainers at the camps. The Taliban militia
that controls most of Afghanistan grew out of the same religious
movement in Pakistan that gave rise to various militant
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from sharing vaguely enunciated ideological and religious
underpinnings, there are no overt connections between the jailed
cleric and his group with bin Laden. But when the United States
tried to force Afghanistan to deport bin Laden, the militant groups
in Kashmir were among the first to offer him asylum. It has also
not been fully confirmed who the hijackers are, although one is
reportedly Azhar's brother. His family has denied the report.
</P>
<P>
   This is the third violent attempt to gain release for Azhar. The
two previous attempts were kidnappings of Westerners. In the first
case, the victims were released, but in the second case in 1995,
one victim escaped, one was beheaded and the remaining four
tourists _ an American, two Britons and one German _ are still
missing and presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   According to Indian government officials and subsequent official
reports, Azhar was born to a wealthy, land-owning family in 1968 in
the central Pakistani city of Bahawalpur. Local press reports say
that after completing his education, he taught at an Islamic
institution in Karachi before gravitating to the publications
distributed by the religious movement he joined. He speaks Punjabi,
Urdu, Arabic and English.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, he went to Kashmir to broaden his recruitment efforts,
according to Indian officials, although his family has maintained
that he went as a journalist.
</P>
<P>
   This month marks the 10th anniversary of the bitter fighting in
Kashmir, a predominantly Muslim province, to either gain outright
independence or to join Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   An Indian government report described Azhar as a ``highly
motivated, committed and fundamentalist militant.''

<P>
   To many outsiders, Cleveland is identified with two ignominious
events: the heavily polluted Cuyahoga River's catching fire in
1969, and, nine and a half years later, the city's default on its
loans _ the first municipality to go bankrupt since the Great
Depression.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one years later, with a flush checkbook and an
incombustible river, Cleveland has a burgeoning restaurant scene.
From the Flats area on the city's winding riverfront to the
renascent Warehouse District near downtown and the West Side's
gentrifying Tremont neighborhood, the scent of char-grilled duck
and truffles is in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny's Bar
</P>
<P>
   If you go to Cleveland to see I.M. Pei's striking Rock and Roll
Hall of Fame or other local attractions and would like to try a
classic Cleveland dining spot, head over to Johnny's, on Fulton
Road.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want some history?'' exclaimed Ricky Paletta, our winsome
waiter. ``This is history, right here _ three generations!''
Paletta is one of those wonderful waiters that you come upon, if
you are lucky, a handful of times in your dining life. With
slicked-back hair, a crescendo laugh and irrepressible personality,
he exudes enthusiasm for his profession. Paletta can recite dozens
of daily specials (or so it seems), set tables with a graceful
swoop and replenish wine, all the while closely monitoring other
tables in the room.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny's, which could be called Italian-Continental, is a long,
bilevel space that looks as if an architect started an Art Deco
makeover but found a better job and left. The mahogany paneled main
dining room, with its leopard-spotted carpet and Roman murals, is
neighborly and convivial.
</P>
<P>
   One of the house specials is confit of muscovy duck with a pear
glaze and flageolets; although it was not cooked long enough in its
fat to be a succulent confit, it was enjoyable nonetheless. Duck on
the appetizer list _ pep-pered, nearly blackened and served with a
walnut and sun-dried cherry sauce _ was terrific.
</P>
<P>
   A main course veal chop, full-flavored, tender and nicely
seared, came with a heady veal-stock sauce along with sun-dried
tomatoes, shiitake mushrooms and basil. The kitchen really cranks
it up with tournedos of veal stuffed with black truffles,
accompanied by caramelized apples and a Calvados reduction _ the
most expensive dish on the menu, at $32.95.
</P>
<P>
   The one seafood dish sampled, pan-seared sauteed black sea bass,
had too many actors onstage: a mussel flan, braised Swiss chard,
confit of artichokes, gratin potatoes _ not bad, just confusing.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny's has a top-end international wine list, with California,
France and Italy well represented; most selections are in the high
$30s and up.
</P>
<P>
   For dessert, there are majestic pumpkin Napoleon with crunchy
pralines, Grand Marnier chocolate mousse bombe, bananas Foster.
Considering the main-course portions, these gastronomic barbells
may be academic.
</P>
<P>
   A second Johnny's opened downtown about six years ago; and in
November, a third sibling, Johnny's Bistro, made its debut in the
Warehouse District.
</P>
<P>
   Lola Bistro And Wine Bar
</P>
<P>
   Like a number of top Cleveland chefs, Michael Symon, 30, did his
gastronomic boot camp in the East and then returned home. At Lola
Bistro and Wine Bar, his rockin' three-year-old establishment in
the Tremont district, he turns out some of the city's most
inventive and compelling fare. The industrial chic setting, with
echoing pop music and eerie overhead lights resembling dripping
candles, is both energetic and comforting.
</P>
<P>
   Symon has been showing up in national food magazines recently,
lauded for dishes like ``slash and burn'' grouper and
coriander-crusted tuna. Both are worth trying. Despite its name,
the former is a low-voltage blackened fillet with a nice
counterpoint relish of sweetish red peppers and onions, alongside
crispy crab ``tater tots.'' The aromatic tuna, expertly cooked,
came with a refreshing sidekick of sweet-and-sour eggplant and
ginger-laced tomato jam.
</P>
<P>
   Among starters I liked the crisp, firm-textured sweetbreads
enhanced with smoked bacon, and the delectable steak tartare, with
an unconventional but harmonious potato crust. One creation sounded
so off-the-wall that I had to try it: smoked trout with a spicy
watermelon salad. Let's just say that these combatants should
return to their respective corners.
</P>
<P>
   From start to finish we had terrific and discreet service. For
example, when there was a temporary glitch with my credit card, our
server passed me a note under the table. Lola has a well-chosen and
modestly priced wine selection. A 1996 Dry Creek Reserve Fume Blanc
($26) had just the right degree of tartness to stand up to the
variegated food.
</P>
<P>
   For dessert there was a mellow apple bread pudding crowned with
a Jack Daniel's cream sauce, a moist and luxurious cheesecake made
with pumpkin and goat cheese, and a nicely sharp lemon tart.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Point Grille
</P>
<P>
   This two-year-old restaurant in a towering brick-walled
warehouse a short walk from downtown is a bright, casual spot with
a restrained nautical decor. Aside from chicken and a few steaks,
it's all seafood here, and reasonably good at that.
</P>
<P>
   At lunch our foursome started with a sparkling oyster assortment
and a well-made gnocchi nestled under julienne of duck confit.
Unfortunately, deep-fried oysters sank under the weight of their
batter; better bets are the ripe-tasting tomato bisque with blue
cheese, or the creamy seafood chowder.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen has a fondness for wrapping things in other things,
and in the case of a fillet of tilapia, the coconut coating was
mild enough to let the fish's flavor come through. Also well
prepared are the rare-seared tuna with a punchy wasabi risotto, and
the almond-crusted Lake Erie walleye, which came with a sweet and
salty apple-pancetta hash.
</P>
<P>
   Our waitress couldn't have been more congenial and helpful. As
for wine, Blue Point's list needs more inexpensive selections; we
chose a lovely 1997 Sanford Rose ($30). For the finale, the best
dessert was a fine cinnamon-pumpkin cheesecake.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Flying Fig
</P>
<P>
   Naming restaurants after fruits and vegetables that perform
implausible feats was popular in the 1970s, and I thought this
silliness had ended. Enter the Flying Fig, a four-month-old spot in
the Ohio City neighborhood. Eclectic American fare with Asian
accents is the game in this minimalist industrial space with subtle
Japanese touches.
</P>
<P>
   We arrived at 9 p.m. on a slow Sunday night, which may have
prompted groans in the kitchen, but quality did not suffer. An
appetizer of lightly bound crab fritters stoked with plenty of
black pepper was a good starter, as was the fig and prosciutto
salad. Only the spring roll of clashing elements (smoked chicken,
wild mushrooms and brie) was a turnoff.
</P>
<P>
   Among main courses, first prize went to the seared and juicy
hanger steak with caramelized shallots and garlic mashed potatoes.
Next was grilled pork tenderloin _ even though we had to send it
back for a little more cooking _ with a pistachio marmalade and
sweet-potato-and-andouille hash. (It tastes better than it sounds.)
A cinder-block-sized slab of sesame-crusted tuna was well cooked
and pleasantly crunchy, but a side of stir-fried vegetables fell
flat from lack of seasoning.
</P>
<P>
   Flying Fig's eclectic wine list is well priced and thoughtfully
matched with the food, with good selections from $25 to $30. We
broke through the barrier with a supple claret from Niebaum-Coppola
vineyards (the Diamond Series) for $33.
</P>
<P>
   Desserts are where the fig reaches its highest altitude,
especially with the bittersweet chocolate-and-dried-cherry bread
pudding, and the caramel pecan tart with a cappuccino custard
sauce. If you haven't had enough of flourless fallen chocolate
cake, the version here is oozingly executed.
</P>
<P>
   Mojo
</P>
<P>
   Another Tremont neighborhood hot spot, across from Lola, is
five-month-old Mojo, a hip, bibulous place that serves a tapas-like
menu along with a half-dozen ``big plates.'' High-tech lighting, a
black ceiling, black tablecloths, black T-shirts on servers _ you
get the picture. The open kitchen and plangent rock music amplify
the festive mood.
</P>
<P>
   On a busy Saturday night we angled into the bar and sampled what
the chef, Michael Herschman, describes as contemporary American
fare with Latin, Asian and Mediterranean accents. The offerings
include a pleasantly piquant charred chicken salad with a red chili
miso sauce for $4.50 and a lively roasted salmon with spicy
pralines and quinoa, a ``big plate,'' for $19. Most are in the $6
range.
</P>
<P>
   A Thai-style beef salad with a red curry vinaigrette had a
slight kick, while plantain fritters with lemon creme fraiche were
tasty but sodden. Pizza with shaved onions, tomatoes, basil and
goat cheese was a felicitous combination, agreeably tart and sweet
_ what you would expect for a chef who worked for Wolfgang Puck?
Tempura of quail, not quite crispy enough, came with a zippy carrot
salad and a mixture of spiced green apples and pomegranates.
Succulent baby back ribs were delicious with a mango barbecue
sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Since we stopped here only briefly before another dinner, we did
not sample dessert or get a full impression of the service. The
mostly American wine list has some uncommon selections that would
be interesting to try; however, for a young, casual place there are
too few selections under $30.
</P>

   GERMANY: KOHL INVESTIGATION
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors in Bonn plan a criminal investigation against former
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who has admitted he kept secret bank
accounts and received more than $1 million in undisclosed political
contributions while in office. Dismissing demands from even his own
party, the Christian Democratic Union, Kohl has refused to name the
donors. The prosecutor is expected to recommend an investigation on
Wednesday; if there is no objection within two days from the head
of Parliament, who has already urged an inquiry, work will begin
immediately.

<P>
   GERMANY: SENDING FOREIGN PRISONERS HOME
</P>
<P>
   Justice Minister Herta Dauebler-Gmelin said foreigners convicted
and jailed in Germany should be sent to their home countries to
serve their sentences, provided lawful penal systems exist there.
Foreigners and immigrants of German ancestry are among the
``marginal groups that often end up in prison'' and thus contribute
to overcrowding, she said.

<P>
   INDONESIA, PORTUGAL: LINKS RESTORED
</P>
<P>
   Portugal and Indonesia re-established full diplomatic relations.
A communique signed by Portuguese and Indonesian envoys at the
United Nations ended an estrangement that began in 1975 with
Indonesia's annexation of East Timor, a Portuguese colony. East
Timor has been under U.N. administration since residents voted for
independence in August.

 &HT;    A Phish Story
 &HT;    By Brian D. Crecente
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Entering the world of the experimental
rock group Phish is like joining a Fraternal Order.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of wearing a red fez or dressing up like Elvis and
buzzing down some main street parade in a tiny go-cart, you listen
to funky music, pose nude for mass photos, take part in enormous
food fights, and proudly call yourself a Phishead _ one of
thousands of fans who follow the band from venue to venue.
</P>
<P>
   Phishites _ the Deadheads of the '90s _ have their own language,
their own culture, and, of course, their own music.
</P>
<P>
   And the band they worship _ a quirky quartet that formed 15
years ago while in college in Vermont _ has the drawing power of
the Pied Piper, but no hit records. Instead, they throw multi-day
music festivals with bizarre themes: ``Tropical Hot Dog Night,''
``In the Aquarium,'' ``The Great Went'' (an extraterrestrial
theme). They provide off-stage entertainment. They thrive on
audience participation. And they encourage fans to tape the
craziness.
</P>
<P>
   It's the fans that make Phish. They clean up after shows, they
play pranks on the band (and in turn have pranks played on them),
and they wait for the next multi-day festival, where they can check
out the band's latest incarnation.

   BUDGET HELPS EFFORTS TO PROTECT U.S. PARKS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lyndon B. Johnson used to talk about the modest
Texas rancher who only wanted to settle down on his own little
spread, and acquire the immediately surrounding property. For the
National Park Service and other federal agencies, though, the task
of preserving the public's property sometimes boils down to
acquiring the little private properties that the government's land
surrounds.
</P>
<P>
   That should be easier to afford this year, because the budget
that passed Congress before Thanksgiving included more than $450
million to buy land for conservation this fiscal year, which ends
Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Private owners hold title or rights to use millions of acres
within the national parks, and much more within the boundaries of
state parks, national forests and other public lands.
Conservationists are worried that there is increasing pressure to
develop these lands, known as ``inholdings.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Pritchard, the president of the National Park Trust, a
private nonprofit organization that buys land for conservation,
calls development on these lands the single greatest threat to
national and state parks. In the U.S. Virgin Islands, for example,
the trust says that investors from around the world have purchased
tracts inside the Virgin Islands National Park and are offering
undeveloped quarter-acre lots for $1 million each.
</P>
<P>
   With the federal budget surplus swelling, it seems possible that
more threatened tracts than ever could be bought by the government
if Congress permanently increases spending by the Land and Water
Conservation Fund, which is financed by revenues from offshore
drilling leases.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, President Clinton proposed a land-acquisition
budget of about $1 billion a year, paid for out of the fund.
Republicans and Democrats offered competing proposals to spend even
more. But despite widespread political support, legislation that
would lock in spending of billions of dollars for years to come got
bogged down in the broader debates over how to allocate the
prospective surplus in future years, and did not come to the floor
of either the House or the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Still, conservationists were thrilled with the amount set aside
for buying land this year. In the past, the typical $900 million in
annual oil-lease revenues vastly exceeded the amount that the
government spent to buy land. This year, the federal government
will be spending about half the $900 million. Conservationists hope
that in future years, the remainder will be handed over to the
states for land purchases.
</P>
<P>
   The National Park Trust says that there are about seven million
acres of private property in the national parks. The amount of
private property within federal lands grew by 1.6 million acres in
the last decade (mainly because of the protection of new lands,
like those in the Mojave Desert, which surround extensive private
property). By some federal estimates, there is as much as $10
billion worth of private property within federal boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   High Country News, a Colorado newspaper that covers the Rocky
Mountain region, reported last year that the scarcity and
popularity of recreation property in the West has sent the value of
inholdings ``into the stratosphere,'' and that owners are holding
out for high prices or threatening to develop the land to spur
federal agencies into making generous bids.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Park Service, about 200,000 of the 7 million
acres in national parks held by private owners are threatened with
development. For example, when Death Valley National Park was
expanded in 1994, it encompassed a defunct mine, creating a new
inholding, and the owners tried to reopen the mine. But they
recently agreed to sell the property to the federal government for
$2.5 million, according to the Wilderness Society, the conservation
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in California, the group says, there are more than
24,000 acres of inholdings in national forests _ at least $1
million worth of land, where owners are free to build homes, cut
timber or develop in other ways. (The society publishes a list of
acquisition priorities at
www.wilderness.org/eyewash/lwcfproposed.htm.)
</P>
<P>
   While land acquisition enjoys considerable public support, there
is also an active lobby of private owners who oppose government
purchases of land. The American Lands Rights Association, which
claims 18,000 members, says there are 1.2 million inholders
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Cushman, executive director of the association, told the
Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee in April: ``More than
115,000 landowners have already lost their land to the Park Service
alone since 1966 because of the Land and Water Conservation Fund.
Often, the only reason a landowner wants to sell is that he has
been harassed and driven half crazy trying to deal with the Park
Service, which generally fails to negotiate in good faith.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kevin Collins, legislative director of the National Parks
and Conservation Association, says that these fears are unfounded.
``There has never been any danger of the National Park Service
indiscriminately taking over public land.'' He says a bill that
passed the House Resources Committee in November ``actually
strengthens private property safeguards.''

 &HT;    From humble beginnings, Phish a band with cult status
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   During their 15 years together, the band has played more than a
thousand shows, recorded 10 albums (with no bonafide hits), and had
a Ben &AMP; Jerry's ice cream flavor named for them. Here, their career
highlights:
</P>
<P>
   1983: Philosophy major Trey Anastasio; chemical engineering
major Jon ``Fish'' Fishman; and electrical engineering majors Mike
Gordon and Jeff Holdsworth meet at the University of Vermont and
form Blackwood Convention. They premiere in the basement of a dorm
using a hockey stick as a microphone stand and playing mostly cover
music. Eventually, they are kicked off stage and replaced with a
Michael Jackson tape.
</P>
<P>
   1984: The band renames itself Phish and plays in the basement of
Slade Hall at UVM in October. They play their first bar gig in
December.
</P>
<P>
   1985: Phish plays at Goddard College and gains a small
following. In the fall, keyboardist Page McConnel joins the band.
</P>
<P>
   1986: Jeff quits the band, graduates, travels for two years and
eventually becomes a born-again Christian. Mike changes his major
from electrical engineering to filmmaking and communications. Trey
and Fish transfer to Goddard College where Page goes to school. A
show draws a crowd of 169.
</P>
<P>
   1987: Mike graduates. Trey continues to work with his mentor,
composing teacher Ernie Stires, getting academic credit at Goddard
for writing fugues and big band arrangements that find their way
into Phish songs.
</P>
<P>
   1989: Phish play at the Rock &AMP; Roll Rumble where Fish lowers
himself, naked, from the rafters to play a solo on a vacuum
cleaner. The band is forced to rent its own venue at the Paradise
in Boston because the club doesn't feel they will do well. More
than 650 people buy tickets, selling out the club, and another 200
fans listen from outside. Phish embarks on their first mini-tour in
the Southeast. The band's first record is released on an
independent label.
</P>
<P>
   1990: Phish tours Colorado in the spring and the Southeast in
the Fall. Die-hard fans start Phish.Net, an Internet-based alliance
of Phish fans.
</P>
<P>
   1991: The band tours the country from February through May. In
early August, one of their first fans, Amy Skelton, hosts a free
show at her horse farm in Auburn, Maine, and it becomes the first
of many Amy's Farm shows. Elektra signs the band in late November.
</P>
<P>
   1992: Phish begins a national tour in March. After a month off,
the band tours in Europe, opening for the Violent Femmes, then
plays four shows on the first HORDE tour and wraps up the year
opening for Santana.
</P>
<P>
   1993: Phish tour the country from February to May. They begin
offering designated taping areas at their concerts to accommodate
audience recording.
</P>
<P>
   1994: A volunteer coalition of Phish fans dedicated to
minimizing the environmental impact of the shows forms the G-Crew,
short for the Green Crew.
</P>
<P>
   1995: Tickets become available for Phish concerts via
mail-order. Grateful Dead frontman Jerry Garcia dies and Phish
fan-base is bolstered by ex-Deadheads.
</P>
<P>
   1996: Phish makes an appearance at the JazzFest in New Orleans.
They head to Europe in July to play some shows with Santana. The
band holds their first festival, The Clifford Ball.
</P>
<P>
   1997: The band returns to Europe to play 14 headline shows at
small clubs and theaters. Phish joins Ben and Jerry, of Ben and
Jerry Ice Cream fame, on Ben's birthday to celebrate the release of
Ben and Jerry's new flavor, Phish Food _ chocolate ice cream with
marshmallows, caramel swirls and fudge fish.

 &HT;    Performance art is a Phish fundamental
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Phish experience is about music, of course, but it's also
about performance art. The band's concerts and festivals always
come with a theme and it's kept under wraps until the crowds show
up.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the buzz about the New Year's Eve concert at Big
Cypress Seminole Indian Reservation? What should fans expect from a
band that has hosted concerts themed ``Tropical Hot Dog Night'' and
``Never-ending Balloon Drop''?
</P>
<P>
   How about ``Outdoor Festival.'' That's the uncharacteristically
generic name circulating on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But Phish fans _ between 60,000 and 100,000 of them _ will flock
to Big Cypress all the same, and word has it they hope to set a
record for the most people doing the same dance at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   For the uninitiated, here's a look at some of Phish's biggest
gigs of the late '90s:
</P>
<P>
   The Clifford Ball
</P>
<P>
   Theme: The first outdoor festival hosted by Phish in August
1996, was named after famed aviator Clifford O'Sullivan. Phish's
first festival kept to an aviation theme, with daily flights of
bombers, fighters, gliders and just about anything else that would
fly, including a plane pulling a banner that said ``Help . . .
We're out of fuel . . . Seriously. . . ``
</P>
<P>
   Crowd Control: More than 70,000 fans trekked from across the
country to the former Air Force base in Plattsburgh, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Fun Stuff: The two-day event included carnival rides, wandering
jugglers and stilt walkers. Also performing: a classical violin
quartet, a blues quartet, a choral quartet, guitar soloists and a
full orchestra playing to fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   Audience Participation: The crowds outnumbered the residents of
Clinton County, where the base is located, four-to-one and
temporarily made Plattsburgh the ninth largest city in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The Great Went
</P>
<P>
   Theme: The band's 1997 U.S. summer tour culminated with The
Great Went, a multi-day event held at the former Lorin Air Force
Base in Limestone, Maine. The abandoned airstrip, known in the
1960s for alien sightings, set the tone: Eerie light effects and
glowing cones gave the festival an otherworldly atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Crowd Control: More than 65,000 fans attended.
</P>
<P>
   Fun Stuff: The world's largest fire truck hosed down thousands
of fans as they raced into the front gates. Halfway through the
show, a huge trailer rig drove through the festival while Phish
played from a towed flatbed.
</P>
<P>
   Audience Participation: Fans donated works of art to the band
who then turned them into a giant collage which was set on fire at
the end of the festival. The flaming art doesn't even come close to
the festival's highlight: about 1,100 people posing for what is
believed to be the largest outdoor nude picture ever taken.
</P>
<P>
   The Lemonwheel
</P>
<P>
   Theme: The band returned to Loring Air Force Base in 1998. This
time, jugglers, rides and wandering minstrels transformed the
airstrip into a carnival.
</P>
<P>
   Crowd Control: More than 60,000 attended the two-day event.
</P>
<P>
   Fun Stuff: The concert grounds also featured several beer
gardens and The Garden of Infinitive Pleasantries, which included
prayer temples, smoking huts, crawling tubes, a garden of stacked
stone sculptures, and craftsmen and artists at work.
</P>
<P>
   Audience Participation: Fans made candles, which were used to
light an enormous wick that spiraled around the stage, circled the
crowd and finally set off a finale of fireworks.

   Along the Thames, a Millennium History
</P>
<P>
   The London String of Pearls Millennium Festival, a yearlong
celebration of Britain's greatest social, political, cultural and
technological achievements of the last 1,000 years, will allow
access to 67 institutions along the River Thames.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the sites, which stretch from Greenwich to Kew Gardens,
will open to the public for the first time. Among these are the
Shipwright's Palace at Deptford, built by Henry VIII when he
founded the Royal Dockyard in 1513; the British government's
Foreign and Commonwealth Office, which will have 12 open days, and
Lambeth Palace, home of the archbishop of Canterbury since about
1200.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other places and events, the Houses of Parliament are
staging an exhibition on the workings of Parliament, and the Museum
of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society is showing its collection
covering four centuries of British medicine. There are
behind-the-scenes tours at the London Weekend Television Studios,
and a look at the BBC World Service and its impressive 1920s
headquarters at Bush House Aldwich.
</P>
<P>
   Also, London Transport will be running trips to unused
historical underground stations, and the Horse Guards building in
Whitehall will be open for tours for the first time, allowing
visitors to see the desk across which Hitler and Neville
Chamberlain negotiated in 1938 and the office where Wellington
planned the Napoleonic campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Information is available by phone at (44-171) 665-1540 or
(44-171) 665-1558 and on the Web at www.stringofpearls.org.uk. A
free brochure is available from the British Tourist Authority, 551
Fifth Ave., Suite 701, New York, NY 10176; (800) 462-2748.

   Palm Beach to Bahamas by 99-Minute Hydrofoil
</P>
<P>
   Sea Jets, a new company based in Riviera Beach, Fla., has
started hydrofoil service between Palm Beach, Fla., and Grand
Bahama Island. Sea Jets' hydrofoils, called jetfoils and made by
Boeing, can skim the surface of the water at more than 50 miles an
hour and hold 250 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The boats are entirely enclosed, with seating areas much like an
aircraft's. Like air travelers, passengers are served soft drinks
and snacks by cabin attendants. Beer, wine and liquor are available
at extra cost.
</P>
<P>
   The hydrofoils make two round trips between the Port of Palm
Beach and Freeport every day except Tuesday and Wednesday, when
there are no trips. Departures from Palm Beach for the 65-mile,
99-minute journey are at 9 a.m. and 4:30 p.m.; return trips are at
noon and 7 p.m. Round-trip tickets cost $99 to $115, plus $25 tax;
$49 to $55, plus tax, for ages 3 to 16. Information and
reservations: (877) 273-2538.
</P>
<P>
   Train Links Brussels and de Gaulle Airport
</P>
<P>
   New high-speed trains now make direct runs between Brussels,
Belgium, and Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris. The trains, called
Thalys (a made-up name, pronounced TAL-iss), are capable of speeds
up to 186 miles an hour and take about one hour 25 minutes to
travel between the airport and Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   The Thalys line now operates 25 times a day between Brussels and
Paris, 21 times to Gare du Nord and four times to Charles de Gaulle
Airport. The fare, $65 in second class and $103 in first class, and
$56 in either class on weekends, is the same for service to
downtown Paris or to the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Thalys service is available between Paris; Brussels; Amsterdam,
the Netherlands; Cologne, Germany; and Dusseldorf, Germany. In
summer, the high-speed service will be extended to Hanover,
Germany, where Expo 2000 will take place from June 1 to Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   The Thalys fares are good until at least March, and Rail Europe,
which represents the European railroads in the United States, has
announced that no increases are planned this year in fares for the
Europass or the Eurailpass and its subsidiary passes _ the
Flexipass, the Saverpass and the Youthpass.
</P>
<P>
   Eurailpasses are good in 17 European countries, and Europasses
are good in up to seven European countries. All of the passes are
intended for purchase before travelers go abroad. These are good on
Thalys, but reservations are required, for $25 or $13 extra.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the Eurailpass ranges from $554 for 15 days of
unlimited rail travel to $1,558 for three months. The Europass
costs $348 for five days of travel in a two-month period in France,
Germany, Italy, Spain and Switzerland. More information: (888)
382-7245.

<P>
   Seven Airlines Give an Inch for Middle Passenger
</P>
<P>
   Seven foreign airlines have made a small change on their
single-aisle Airbus jets to ease that feeling of being squeezed
into a middle seat. Those middle seats _ designated B and E on the
six-across economy-class seating layouts _ are now 20 inches wide,
1 inch wider than the aisle and window seats.
</P>
<P>
   The carriers with wider middle seats are Air France, All Nippon
Airways, Asiana Airlines, Austrian Airlines, British Airways, China
Southern Airlines and Lufthansa.
</P>
<P>
   The wider seats are possible because the single-aisle Airbus
jets _ the A-318, A-319 and A-320 _ are 7 inches wider than the
competing Boeing 737. The seven airlines use the other 5 inches for
wider aisles, which allows people to squeeze past the food carts.
</P>
<P>
   None of the American airlines that fly these Airbus jets have
installed the wider middle seats.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland Orchestra Is Getting Its Home Back
</P>
<P>
   Severance Hall, home of the Cleveland Orchestra, reopens
Saturday after a two-year restoration. The building, containing a
2,000-seat concert auditorium and a 400-seat chamber hall, was
opened in February 1931 and named for Elisabeth Severance, who was
the wife of John Severance, the president of the orchestra's board.
</P>
<P>
   Hand-painted murals, gilt ceilings and marble wainscoting have
been restored, and the main stage was refurbished. The original
pipe organ is also being restored but it will not be ready in time
for the reopening.
</P>
<P>
   The orchestra plans a six-week program of concerts to celebrate
the new splendor. On Saturday, the music director, Christoph von
Dohnanyi, will conduct works by Wagner, Vaughan Williams and Ravel.
The next night, chamber music by Schumann, Brahms and Stravinsky
will be performed; the pianist in all three works will be Leif Ove
Andsnes.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 13, 14 and 15, Dohnanyi will lead ``The Damnation of
Faust'' by Berlioz, with the mezzo-soprano Jennifer Larmore. The
Cleveland Community Gospel Chorus joins the orchestra in a tribute
to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on Jan. 16, and the soprano
Sylvia McNair will sing Ravel's ``Scheherazade'' on Jan. 20, 22 and
25. The resident conductor, Jahja Ling, will conduct Bruckner's
Eighth Symphony Feb. 3 through 6.
</P>
<P>
   The reopening events end with a family concert at 1:30 p.m. Feb.
12, featuring the Cleveland Orchestra and its Youth Orchestra
playing works by Vaughan Williams, Prokofiev and Gabrieli.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets range from $25 for chamber concerts to $300 for the
Saturday opening. Tickets to most regular performances cost between
$19 and $58. The Jan. 16 King concert is free but reservations are
required.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Entrepreneurs Discuss Bay Area's Pioneering Spirit  &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
California has been a cauldron of creativity in the 20th century.
<P>
   Inventors and scientists in the Golden State have created
everything from the radio vacuum tube and television to the atomic
bomb and personal computer. They helped spawn entire industries
such as integrated circuits, the Internet and biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle interviewed a handful of entrepreneurs and
business leaders who helped create and build some of Northern
California's major industries to find out more about the region's
unique entrepreneurial spirit and what they see in store for the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Our group includes Arthur Rock, who is credited with creating
the venture capital industry; Andrew Grove, chairman of Intel
Corp., whose microprocessors run 80 percent of all personal
computers; Charles Schwab, the discount brokerage king; Mickey
Drexler, the CEO of apparel retailer Gap Inc.; and Jerry Yang,
co-founder of Yahoo, the leading Internet portal.
</P>
<P>
   These legendary entrepreneurial figures attribute the region's
many successful enterprises to a special amalgam of creative spirit
and availability of risk capital, world-class educational
facilities and a talented, multicultural labor pool open to new
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   And they see a promising future in the new  &LR; coming millennium.
Grove believes e-commerce, though in its infancy, is growing up
quickly, and Rock predicts the Internet will be the main engine for
commercial growth for the next 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming years, Schwab says successful companies must be
especially attentive to the needs of their customers. Drexler, in
particular, stresses the importance of delivering good quality at a
good price and controlling one's brand at all costs.
</P>
<P>
   And Yang envisions a future where people can easily access the
world through a variety of electronic devices.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; ARTHUR ROCK
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; Age:  &LR; 73
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Company:  &LR; Arthur Rock &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Headquarters: &LR;  San Francisco
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Business: &LR;  Wall Street investment banker Arthur Rock helped
spawn Silicon Valley while working at Hayden Stone in New York in
1957. He persuaded his firm and IBM scion Sherman Fairchild to back
seven top engineers and scientists who were unhappy working under
transistor inventor and Nobel Prize winner William Shockley.
</P>
<P>
   After the launch of semiconductor pioneer Fairchild Camera &AMP; &LR; and
Instrument, Rock moved west in 1961 and started a venture capital
partnership with attorney Tommy Davis. They financed a succession
of brilliant entrepreneurs, including Max Palevsky (Scientific Data
Systems/Xerox), Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore (Intel), and Steve
Wozniak and Steve Jobs (Apple Computer).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Chronicle: What Makes the Bay Area uniquely entrepreneurial?
</P>
<P>
   Rock: It all goes back to Stanford Engineering School Dean Fred
Terman. He had the vision of encouraging people at Stanford to
start companies and stay in the area, and he helped get them
government contracts and research grants. (Terman persuaded two of
his top graduate students, Bill Hewlett and William Packard, to
stay in Palo Alto and commercialize the audio oscillator they
developed at Stanford.)
</P>
<P>
   More generally, there is the ``go-west-young-man'' spirit that
attracts entrepreneurs to California.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: What was your vision in starting your investment venture?
</P>
<P>
   A: Most of the wealth was in the East, and all the deals and
companies were out here. Plus banks were governed by the ``prudent
man'' rule; starting new companies was dangerous and the idea was
foreign to them.
</P>
<P>
   I and Tommy Davis formed Davis &AMP; Rock with $5 million from
wealthy individual investors.
</P>
<P>
   Our biggest hit was Scientific Data Systems. We invested less
than $300,000 in 1961, and in 1968, the company was sold to Xerox
for just under $1 billion and we got more than $30 million. That
was a big number in those days. We also invested in Intel and
Apple.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: What is your current involvement in high-tech investing?
</P>
<P>
   A: I stopped raising money and went on my own in 1980. We took
our time and made serious judgments. Now everything is on Internet
time. Everything moves very quickly, takes a lot of money and you
have nanoseconds to make up your mind.
</P>
<P>
   But you can't stay on the sidelines. I'm trying to make
investments that are not only profitable in themselves, but which
benefit society. For example, I'm president of Basic Fund, which
gives college scholarships to about 1,500 inner-city high school
graduates.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have a good education, you won't be able to make it
in a wired world. There will be fewer blue-collar jobs, and the
difference between the ``haves'' and ``have-nots'' will grow.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: How important is the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   A: The last half of the last century was mechanical. The first
half of this century was driven by electricity and the past 50
years have been driven by electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Until five years ago, I didn't see anything like the steam
engine, transmission of electricity or the semiconductor that would
be the engine of growth for the next 50 years. I became pessimistic
until I realized the Internet will drive the economy.
</P>
<P>
   You haven't seen anything yet. The Internet is expanding
exponentially and eliminating all kinds of inefficient tasks and
people. Yes, lots of companies are losing money and many will
disappear. It's like the turn of the century, when there were 150
to 200 auto companies. But big companies will come out of this, and
I would think many local ones will do fabulously.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
ANDREW S. (ANDY) GROVE
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Age:  &LR; 63
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Company:  &LR; Intel Corp.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Headquarters:  &LR; Santa Clara
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Business:  &LR; Founded in 1968 to build memory chips, Intel
introduced the first microprocessor four years later. These silicon
circuits sparked both the computer and Internet revolutions.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Today, an estimated 80 percent of PCs are powered by Intel
processors and the company is the fifth-most-valuable company in
America, with a stock market value topping $277 billion.
Budapest-born Grove joined Intel shortly after it was founded by
two of his colleagues at Fairchild Semiconductor and was CEO for a
decade, ending in 1997, when he was named Time magazine's Man of
the Year. Grove remains chairman of Intel, teaches business
strategy at Stanford and writes. His most recent book was ``Only
the Paranoid Survive.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Chronicle: Why is there so much innovation in this region?
</P>
<P>
   Grove: In the 1960s and 1970s, it was the presence of Stanford
and Hewlett-Packard, a lot of technical manpower, equipment
companies ready to supply startups and venture
capitalists/investment bankers who understood what silicon was.
</P>
<P>
   We have had different waves of technology. But in each case, the
physical proximity, the ability to cross-pollinate, the
availability of a large pool of talent and capital have been
crucial.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1980s, the leading edge was the PC industry based in
Silicon Valley. It was easy to get in a car with a salesman and
visit six companies in a day. A lot of them like Victor, Gavilan
and Altos are defunct or merged into other companies, but another
wave of technology took their place. In the '90s, the networking
industry emerged and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: Why did all these waves happen here?
</P>
<P>
   A: Why is Wall Street, Wall Street or Hollywood, Hollywood or
Detroit, Detroit? You have a core of companies, a pool of talent
and the place and the industry are almost equivalent.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: How do you see the Internet changing the economy and the way we
do things?
</P>
<P>
   A: At this stage, a lot of ordinary activities are being
transposed onto the Internet. Commerce is moving over in bits and
pieces, company by company, Web site by Web site. The majority of
the startups have little to do with technology and are more about
merchandising and services.
</P>
<P>
   We're in the very early stages. Despite all the dot-com ads,
less than 5 percent of all transactions and dollars are moving over
the Internet. Within 10 years or so _ it's hard to be precise _ 50
percent of shopping and banking are likely to move over the
Internet. It will be an order of magnitude higher.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: How will this affect Intel?
</P>
<P>
   A: For 10 to 15 years, the target for our chips has been the
personal computer. It will become more diverse. We supply the
silicon content for Internet access devices, client servers and
networking, and we also supply services. Instead of buying chips,
you will be able to rent time on them much as people lease cars as
well as buy them.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: What do you mean by your book title ``Only the Paranoid
Survive?''
</P>
<P>
   A: This is a time of rapid change. Complacency and inaction are
dead. I wrote the book in 1995 and I don't see any slowdown since
then.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CHARLES R. SCHWAB
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Age:  &LR; 62
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Company:  &LR; Charles Schwab &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Headquarters: &LR;  San Francisco
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Business:  &LR; Founded company in his own name and revolutionized
the brokerage industry after the Securities and Exchange Commission
banned fixed  &LR; deregulated commissions in 1975. Besides pioneering
discount stock trading, the company was one of the first to offer
24-hour phone service, a mutual fund supermarket and online
trading. As part of its ``clicks and mortar'' approach to offering
information and investing services any way its 6.4 million account
holders want it, the company has 325 branches and $628 billion in
customer assets.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Chronicle: What makes the Bay Area unique?
</P>
<P>
   chwab: Perhaps it goes back to the the Forty-Niners and Gold
Rush days. Risk takers have come to California; maybe it's
something in their DNA.
</P>
<P>
   When you put this respect for innovation together with local
universities and the venture capital community, you have a vortex
of creativity. This is a center of highly educated people. Then you
have the climate; once you move here, you hate to move away.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: What was your vision in creating your company?
</P>
<P>
   A: I always had a keen interest in the equity market, and 25
years ago, everyone charged fixed rates _ outrageous fees for less
than great service. Then the Securities and Exchange Commission
deregulated commissions. Some brokers raised rates, but I and a few
others decided to lower rates.
</P>
<P>
   We also paid everyone a salary and bonus based on the success of
the company. By contrast, standard brokers get 35 to 40 percent of
each sales commission. That's how they get compensated, so they are
in selling mode all the time (which may not be in the best interest
of their clients).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; Q: What is the impact of technology and the Internet on your
company?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; A: The Internet is one of the great channels of
communication. I'd put it right up there with the telephone, radio
and television. It combines all of those and is still in its early
stages.
</P>
<P>
   We have embraced the Internet but not to the exclusion of the
telephone or face-to-face contact. In the long term, the most
successful financial services companies will offer the best of
high-touch coupled with high-tech. They'll have both.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, we're doing 80 percent of our transactions through
the Internet, but 70 to 75 percent of our new accounts come in to
our branches.
</P>
<P>
   Most people are very reluctant to send all their money in a
check to somebody 3,000 miles away. That's why we have a Schwab
customer service office within 10 miles of about 85 percent of the
U.S. population.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: How do you see financial services evolving further?
</P>
<P>
   A: The lines are blurring between banks, brokerages and other
services. We already offer online banking, credit and debit cards,
check writing, loans (on margin accounts), term insurance, and we
will offer more products.
</P>
<P>
   The successful players will be those that provide the best
services and the best price _ the best value mix.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for consumers is that the cost of financial
services is going down. In the past three years, the average
commission at Schwab has come down to $40, from $70, and consumers
will continue to get better services at lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   We will utilize technology to add more features and information
so our customers can make informed decisions about what's important
to them _ their money. For example, we'll soon provide investors
(with certain net-worth requirements) access to CEO video
conferences and IPO road shows. We also will be adding more
wireless access to information and trading.
</P>

MILLARD S. (MICKEY) DREXLER
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Age:  &LR; 55
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Company:  &LR; Gap Inc.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Headquarters: &LR;  San Francisco
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Business:  &LR; Started in 1969 by Donald and Doris Fisher and named
for the generation gap, the company initially focused on selling
Levi's and then private-label casual apparel to teenagers. The Gap
recruited Mickey  &LR; Drexler, former president of AnnTaylor cq &LR; , in
1983 and he consolidated the business, built the brand on
bright-colored cotton clothing and extended the line to appeal to
adults as well as kids and babies. The Gap acquired Banana Republic
and built its higher-priced line of casual wear. In 1994, Drexler
launched Old Navy Clothing Co. to appeal to more cost-conscious
shoppers, and a year later, he became CEO.

   &QL; 
Chronicle: What makes the Bay Area unique?
</P>
<P>
   Drexler: Out here you can be who you are, think the way you want
to think, do what you want to do, and there are no rules or
regulations about what the world should be like. There are not a
lot of preconceived notions about running a business, either. I'm a
native New Yorker and love New York, but there, anything goes so
long as it's a certain way.
</P>
<P>
   Our business is a casual lifestyle business. When I came to
California, I felt this was the way the world was going to look in
attitude and feel. It's a more open society.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: How does this translate into business strategy?
</P>
<P>
   A: Our mission has been to bring America good style and quality
at affordable prices. In the past, so-called good taste was owned
mostly by the designers and it was expensive to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   In retailing, every detail is critically important. We have no
desire to own or run factories but want to control anything and
everything that customers sees &LR; , from design and development of
apparel to design and development of stores, catalogs and online.
</P>
<P>
   We also want to sell our own brands; we're not in the commodity
business. You can only buy our brands in our own stores, online or
in our catalog, in Banana Republic's case. You can't control your
business if your goods are in another channel of distribution where
you can be undersold.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: How do you see retailing changing and how do you respond to
e-commerce and the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   A: The better get bigger. In 1990, the top 10 U.S. retailers
controlled 40 percent of apparel sales. Last year, they controlled
62 percent of the market. But it is still very fragmented compared
to other industries. (With close to $10 billion sales, Gap is the
seventh-largest U.S. apparel retailer but holds only about a 5  &LR; 6
percent share of the $170 billion U.S. apparel market.)
</P>
<P>
   The market will increasingly be controlled by the better managed
and more nimble large players. Those with a real reason for being,
including an image, total obsessive control of their brands and
seamless distribution in-store and online, will survive quite well.
</P>
<P>
   To break through the clutter, the Gap (and other brands) need to
have personality and offer good style, good quality and good value.
The Internet is another way for people to buy products and, long
term, it will be an important part of everyone's business. It is
important to let consumers shop when and where they want and also
let them return products they buy online to stores.
</P>

Jerry Yang
</P>
<P>
   Age:  &UR; 33 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Company:  &LR; Yahoo
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Headquarters: &LR;  Santa Clara
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Business: &LR;  With more than 80 million visitors a month, Yahoo is
the leading Internet portal. Yang and David Filo created their
Internet search engine in 1994 while Ph.D. students at Stanford
University. Not only were they early to market with a nifty free
service, they also created a world-class name when they dumped
``Jerry's Guide to the World Wide Web'' and picked Yahoo because
they liked the rude and uncouth connotation.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo built its brand with heavy marketing (including taxi
billboards) and has become a global media company by quickly adding
services in a dozen languages, forming alliances and buying up
competitors such as GeoCities and Broadcast.com.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Chronicle: Why have so many entrepreneurs started businesses in the
Bay Area?
</P>
<P>
   Yang: I came to San Jose from Taiwan when I was 10. I think this
is the most ethnically and culturally diverse area in the world and
that is helpful in an age where things are global.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, this is a place where the best ideas, not people
protecting their turf, survive. There is so much competition that
the best ideas and the best teams end up winning. And then there
are the institutions that foster creativity _ Stanford and other
universities and the venture capital community. It is no accident
that the semiconductor, personal computer, software, Internet and
biotech industries happened here.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: What is your vision for Yahoo and the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yahoo and the Internet will change. It is not just about
searching Web sites and finding information, but about
communicating with others, providing content and commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet ought to be ubiquitous and embedded in people's
lives. They will be able to access the world through us, whether by
personal computer, PDA (personal digital assistant), wireless
device, television, set-top box or home appliance. We want to
personalize service to meet each user's needs. For example, maybe
they will be able to go the refrigerator and order delivery by
hitting a ``get milk'' button.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly more will be happening on the Internet. Education and
research will be huge, though I don't know if distant learning will
replace the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; Q: What do you think of the huge run-up in Internet stocks? Your
company is worth $92 billion, which is double the value of General
Motors, and your stock is selling at nearly 700 times trailing
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   A: People believe the Internet will change people's lives, and I
believe the information economy that was being formed in Silicon
Valley in 1994 and 1995 is transferable and is now moving worldwide
to Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   We can't control what the stock market decides to do. We are
players on the field, and we're there to win the game. What people
pay to watch is not something we have control over. As long as we
are winning the competitive battle, we'll be satisfied.

 Ultimo Closing Its S.F. Outlet _ Jil Sander Superstore to Open  &HT;     By Trish Donnally 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Merchandise is marked 60 percent off at the Ultimo store in
downtown San Francisco, and it's not because of a post-Christmas
sale. The high-fashion store at 140 Geary St. will close on
February 1.
</P>
<P>
   Prada I.P.I. U.S.A. Corp., the Italian fashion company that owns
the adjoining Jil Sander boutique, plans to take over the store
space. Prada reportedly wants to combine the two stores and create
an 8,000-square-foot Jil Sander superstore. Jil Sander officials
declined comment on the report and terms of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Heather Farley, Ultimo Enterprises' sales promotion manager,
said the move was necessary because it was too difficult for the
store to compete with nearby Neiman Marcus. ``It's the location,''
she said. ``We have a strong manager there, a strong selling staff,
a strong product, but the location is weak. It faces Neiman Marcus
... and they're expanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimo, which carries Dolce &AMP; Gabbana, John Galliano, Michael
Kors, Randolph Duke and Chloe, among other top designer labels,
also competes with Saks Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The store is unusual in that it has a walk-through connection to
the Jil Sander boutique, which was until recently (dec. '99) &LR; owned
by Ultimo.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco site is one of three Ultimos in the country.
Joan Weinstein established Ultimo in Chicago 30 years ago, &LR;  and
opened stores in Dallas and San Francisco in April 1997. The San
Francisco store has been the weakest of the three, Farley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, we're pleased with what's happening. We're looking at
it as a positive more than a negative,'' says Stephanie Murphy,
manager of Ultimo. She and her staff have been assured that their
jobs will continue when a new retailer takes over the space.
</P>
<P>
   Neighboring retailers have some regrets about Ultimo's imminent
closure. Billy Bragman, owner of the nearby men's store BillyBlue,
said, ``For me it, was nice, the Silicon Valley types would come
here and their girlfriends would go to Ultimo. You had to be slim
in order to shop there.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bragman is not surprised that the store is closing. He
thought it was poorly designed.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, you walk in and you're faced with steps. You
have to be careful, you're not supposed to have to be careful,
you're supposed to shop. And they made it like a television screen
and whoever is in the store is on view. A woman buying a $3,000
suit does not want to be on view,'' Bragman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, not only do you have to be careful when you're looking at
the merchandise that you don't fall down, but everyone's watching
you.''

 Vanguard Group Replaces S.F. Fund Adviser  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
It isn't easy to lose money in the current bull market. But the $3
billion Vanguard Equity Income Fund is down about 1.4 percent this
year, and Vanguard Group has decided to make some changes in the
fund's management.
<P>
   The No. 2 U.S. mutual fund company said yesterday that it is
replacing San Francisco's Spare, Kaplan, Bischel &AMP; Associates with
Boston's Wellington Management Co. on the team of three ``advisory
firms'' that oversee the equity income fund's assets.
</P>
<P>
   The change will take effect on New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Spare, Kaplan, which has helped manage the Vanguard fund since
1995, was responsible for $481 million, or 16 percent, of the
fund's total assets.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder will continue to be overseen by Palo Alto's Newell
Associates and John A. Levin &AMP; Co. of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spare, Kaplan has served the fund's shareholders capably,''
Vanguard Chairman John Brennan said in a statement. ``Looking
forward, however, we believe that allocating their share of the
fund's portfolio to Wellington Management Co. will provide a better
mix of investment disciplines for the fund's overall portfolio.''
</P>
<P>
   John Woerth, a Vanguard spokesman, said separately that Spare,
Kaplan is not being punished for the equity income fund's
relatively lackluster performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``To portray this as a performance issue is just plain wrong,''
he said. ``The fund has performed well. The board is simply looking
for a new blend of talents for the advisory firms.''
</P>
<P>
   Woerth said Vanguard's board of directors decided to make the
change earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Bischel, Spare, Kaplan's president and director of
investments, said his company had enjoyed an ``excellent''
relationship with Vanguard prior to the board's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have very high regard for Vanguard,'' he said. ``They made
their decision, and we're disappointed by it, but these things
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Bischel declined to comment on the impact that losing Vanguard
as a client will have on his 20-employee firm.
</P>
<P>
   The Vanguard Equity Income Fund is designed to meet the needs of
more conservative investors. Only about 1 percent of its portfolio
is comprised of technology stocks, which have set the pace for Wall
Street's growth this year.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the fund's assets are invested in utilities,
financial-service firms and health care enterprises, which tend to
pay higher dividends but do not hold the same promise of
stratospheric gains as more tech-oriented concerns.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, the equity income fund has failed to keep pace
with the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index for the past five years. The
fund has lost 1.4 percent to date this year, compared with an
approximately 20 percent gain for the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News, the
Vanguard fund has performed well below other funds in the equity
income category. The typical such fund has gained more than 8
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Since it opened in 1988, annual returns for the Vanguard fund
have ranged from a loss of almost 12 percent in 1990 to a 37
percent advance in 1995. The fund has registered gains in all but
three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (Vanguard) fund may not be having a great year, but over
time, this fund has performed just fine for its investors,'' said
Jeff Molitor, Vanguard's director of portfolio review.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he said Spare, Kaplan was not seen as bringing the
right mix to the fund's investments. Wellington, on the other hand,
was viewed as a better fit with the fund's other managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In looking at equity income, one of the elements that we found
attractive in terms of Wellington was that the portfolio would be
more diversified,'' Molitor said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Vanguard had not communicated its concerns about
diversification prior to informing Spare, Kaplan that its services
no longer would be needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't tell managers how to exercise their craft,'' Molitor
said. ``We want managers to have their own style and strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said Spare, Kaplan's five-year tenure co-managing the
equity income fund was unusually brief for Vanguard. The typical
manager, he said, remains with a fund for 10 years or more.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard has had a long, cozy relationship with Wellington,
which is Vanguard's largest external adviser, managing some $84
billion in 14 separate funds.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard was founded by a former Wellington employee, John
Bogle.

   Alaska, Way Off Season
</P>
<P>
   Q. We would like to visit Alaska when the Northern Lights are at
their most stunning, which we hear is in February. What is there to
do in Alaska at this time besides observe the night sky? _ Janet
Krendel, Swarthmore, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   A. The Northern Lights are caused by particles from the sun
being thrown against the earth by solar wind. When the particles
collide with the earth's atmosphere, the energy of the particles
becomes light that can be seen near the poles.
</P>
<P>
   Fairbanks is a popular destination for Northern Lights viewing,
although they are seen in most of the state; November through March
offer the best viewing. Winter activities include snowmobile trips,
dog-sled tours, cross-country skiing and sightseeing flights. Among
the winter festivals is the Anchorage Fur Rendezvous, Feb. 11 to
20, with art exhibits and snow sculpturing among the festivities.
Call (907) 277-8615.
</P>
<P>
   The Fairbanks World Ice Art Championships feature ice sculptures
on view from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily (they are illuminated at
night) until they break up, usually in April. The Single-Block
Classic is March 1 to 3, with each block 5 feet by 8 feet by 3
feet, weighing 7,800 pounds, and the Multiblock Classic is March 6
to 11, with each team of sculptors receiving a dozen 3,000-pound
blocks. Call (907) 451-8250.
</P>
<P>
   The Festival of Native Arts takes place in Fairbanks March 2 to
4, with dancing, singing and storytelling.

CLINTON PLANS NEW VOUCHERS FOR WORKING-CLASS HOUSING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Calif., Texas, Ill., Tenn.)  (rk) 
 By MARC LACEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will propose 120,000 new housing
vouchers for working-class families in the federal budget that he
will send to Congress in February, administration officials said
Tuesday. It would amount to the largest expansion of the housing
program in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The vouchers allow low-income families to find their own
housing, and to use government subsidies to help pay the costs.
Congressional Republicans have been reluctant to finance the
program at the levels requested by the president in recent years,
resulting in a large backlog in applicants. After Clinton proposed
money for 100,000 vouchers this year, Congress eventually approved
60,000.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, 1.4 million families receive such housing vouchers.
But a report prepared by the Department of Housing and Urban
Development in March 1999 found that the number of families waiting
for such assistance had increased to 600,000. The wait for vouchers
has stretched to 10 years in Newark and Los Angeles, seven years in
Houston and five years in Chicago and Memphis, the report found.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said the president's proposed expansion, which will cost
$690 million, is designed to address a paradox of the current
economic expansion. At the same time that the strong national
economy is making many Americans rich, it is hurting millions of
the nation's poorest people by making affordable housing more
difficult to find.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the greatest need for affordable housing in history,''
Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday in an interview. ``The
strong economy is driving up rents. This is the most aggressive
housing budget of his administration. It is the largest request of
the decade.''
</P>
<P>
   White House aides said Clinton would include in his budget a
package of vouchers intended for individuals who are moving from
welfare to work, homeless people, those with large families and
working-class families designated by local housing authorities. All
recipients would have to meet strict income requirements, about
$27,900 per family nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see this as an important part of the overall strategy of
supporting working families,'' an aide to Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president will deliver the broad outlines of his budget on
Jan. 27 at his final State of the Union address. On Feb. 7, he will
send the document to the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Housing experts say the voucher program has grown steadily from
1978 until 1995, when congressional Republicans stopped further
expansions because of concerns about the management of the money.
Since then, there have been only two moderate increases.
</P>
<P>
   One key Republican lawmaker said the key question is how Clinton
intends to finance the new vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I strongly support additional vouchers, provided that the
president can find an acceptable way to pay for them,'' said Rep.
Rick A. Lazio of Long Island, chairman of the House housing
subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   The vouchers continue to be sought-after commodities that can
take years to obtain. The average subsidy, aides said, is about
$400 a month. The tenant kicks in $223 a month, to cover an average
rent of $623.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many low-income families don't live near where their jobs are
and this program allows them to move closer,'' a White House
official said. ``Housing is expensive and it's hard to find. This
program allows them to fill in the gap.''

 &HT;    Texas population surge gives state dubious standingBy Andy
Alford
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It's official: the Lone Star State is big.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is now home to at least 20 million residents, according to
a report to be released by the U.S. Census Bureau today.
</P>
<P>
   That's up from 17 million in 1990 and puts the state second only
to California, which added 3.3 million people. Florida comes in
third for growth, increasing to 15 million people from 12.9
million. Texas also ranks second in overall population.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growth has been phenomenal,'' said Steve Murdock, the chief
demographer at the Texas State Data Service at Texas A &AMP; M
University. Murdock estimates Texas reached 20 million in April,
but census officials have completed estimates now confirming it.
``It's reflective of one of the strongest Texas economies in
history.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas' population grew 18 percent from 1990 to 1999, almost
twice the national growth rate of 9.6 percent, according to the
census bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Murdock said 58 percent of the growth in Texas is due to the
state's relatively high birth rate, 19 percent from residents
moving in from other areas of the country, and 23 percent from
immigration. Murdock estimates about 74 percent of all growth in
Texas is driven by increases in minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the four fastest growing Texas metropolitan areas _
also among top 10 fastest growing in the nation _ are along the
border. The Laredo, McAllen-Edinburg-Mission, and
Brownsville-Harlingen-San Benito areas welcomed more than 256,160
new residents since 1990, a 33 percent increase. The Austin-San
Marcos region added 255,491 new Texans, a 30 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   Murdock and other sociologists say the impressive benchmark
should be met with a degree of caution, and ask education, business
and policy leaders to consider what all this growth means to Texas'
future when the fastest growing populations are those that have
historically been the poorest and the least educated.
</P>
<P>
   If current trends are allowed to continue, Murdock says, it
could mean that the state faces a future where fewer Texans are
employable, causing the state's economic bubble to burst.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge is for Texas to ensure that all segments of
society are competitive as we move into the new millennium,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Murdock and his colleagues at Texas A&AMP;M, continued
growth could also mean:
</P>
<P>
   _ Texas' population will reach 33.8 million by 2030, a 99
percent increase from 1990. A large proportion of that increase
will likely continue to be from foreign immigration and residents
moving in from other states.
</P>
<P>
   _ By 2008, more than half of Texas residents will be non-whites.
By 2030, Anglos would make up about 37 percent of the population,
Hispanics about 46 percent, blacks about 10 percent and the
remaining proportion taken by other racial groups.
</P>
<P>
   _ Unlike many other states, Texas can expect to see an increase
in two-parent households with children, due largely to the increase
in Hispanic and Asian families, which have higher proportions of
two-parent homes than other racial groups.
</P>
<P>
   _ Baby boomers, who make up about a third of the population,
will age the state by 7 years by 2030. The median age, now about
31, would increase to about 38. The population older than 65, now
about 10 percent, will increase to 17 percent by 2030. Texas' aging
population will cause an increased demand for health professionals
and long-term care. Associated costs and hospital visits will
increase with the population, and costs for publicly supported
medical care will also increase substantially. Texas, at 24.5
percent, has the highest proportion of uninsured residents in the
nation, according to the census bureau.
</P>
<P>
   _ The proportion of the labor force that is Anglo is projected
to decrease from about 65 percent in 1990 to about 38 percent in
2030, while the Hispanic population is projected to increase from
22 percent to 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ The educational success of black and Hispanics residents will
likely continue to lag behind those of Anglos, causing income
disparities to continue. Anglos accounted for nearly 92 percent of
households with incomes of more than $100,000 in 1990, and will
likely continue to dominate that group through 2030.
</P>
<P>
   If Texas' economy is to continue to thrive, business leaders
say, the education and income gap between growing poor and minority
groups and others needs to close.
</P>
<P>
   ``Businesses need workers who are skilled and educated so badly,
they will spend what it takes to upgrade education levels,'' said
Mary Scott Nabers, chairwoman-elect of the Greater Austin Chamber
of Commerce. ``Even if they're poor and uneducated now, you're
going to see that change because of the demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Grasshoff, spokesman for the Texas Higher Education
Coordinating Board, said state officials and lawmakers are working
to increase minority opportunities in colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers this year passed a bill that provides college
scholarships for high school students who complete college
preparatory courses and maintain a 2.0 grade point average on a 4.0
scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want another South Africa, where the largest group
becomes those at the bottom,'' said Gloria Rodriguez, founder of
Avance, a program that supports and educates Latino families on
preparing their children for school. ``In order to deal with the
education problems in this nation, you've got to involve families
in their communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said that immigrants and Texas residents should learn
from one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``American competition and aggressiveness have take us to the
moon, but we have to balance it with those values the immigrants
have come with,'' Rodriguez said. ``We value children, family and
the community.

 &HT;    FLORIDA'S POPULATION SURGES DESPITE HIGH NUMBER OF DEATHS
 &HT;    ATTN ERNIE FREDA
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More people died in Florida last year than in any
other state except California, according to a Census Bureau report
to be released on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these 159,752 obituaries, however, Florida's population
surged past 15 million for the first time as new residents poured
in from other states and foreign countries and the state's birth
rate was even healthier than its death rate.
</P>
<P>
   Between July 1, 1998 and July 1, 1999, Florida's population grew
1.4 percent _ from about 14.9 million to 15.1 million. Only
California, Texas and New York are more populous.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau report portrays Florida as a bubbling
demographic stew _ growing rapidly through both domestic and
international in-migration and through births, but also
experiencing a comparably high number of deaths.
</P>
<P>
   While about 5 million more people lived in Texas than in Florida
last year, for example, about 16,400 more people died in Florida
than in Texas. New York had about 3 million more residents than
Florida, but Florida had about 5,500 more deaths than New York
experienced.
</P>
<P>
   California led the nation in both population _ about 33.1
million residents _ and in its 225,723 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's growth pattern reflects its continued popularity as a
retirement haven, said Marc Perry, a Census Bureau demographer.
</P>
<P>
   Florida led the nation in net migration from other states,
gaining 86,511 new residents more than it lost through domestic
moves. ``There is a retiree component to that growth, although we
can't give the exact percentage,'' said Perry. ``But the tradition
(of retiring to Florida) hasn't changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Census Bureau research has shown that Florida has the
second-highest median age for any state populace, ranking only
behind West Virginia, said Perry. The 1998 median age in Florida
was 38.3 years _ compared to 35.2 for the nation as a whole. An
older population translates to more retirees and more deaths.
</P>
<P>
   But Florida is growing a lot faster than it is dying.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Census Bureau reported 195,784 births in the state.
That's 36,032 more people being born than died. That population
boost comes on top of the net gain of 86,511 who moved in from
other states.
</P>
<P>
   And both of those totals are in addition to a net international
migration of 80,463 people. That's how many more people moved into
Florida from other countries than moved away to live in foreign
lands.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Florida netted about 203,000 new residents in the
12-month period.
</P>
<P>
   The state's growth in recent decades has been ``substantial,''
said Perry. ``As recently as 1950, Florida had fewer than 3 million
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the national populace grew from about 270.2 million to
272.6 million _ an increase of 0.9 percent _ during the year-long
period ending on July 1.
</P>
<P>
   For the 14th consecutive year, Nevada was the fastest growing
state with a 3.8 percent increase in population. Percentage-wise,
the other states that grew the fastest were Arizona (up 2.4
percent), Colorado (2.2 percent), Georgia (2 percent) and Idaho
(l.7 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Texas grew 1.7 percent. Florida, California and North Carolina
all grew 1.4 percent. Ironically, California's growth came despite
a net domestic out migration of over 80,000 former residents who
moved to other states. The largest state more than made up that
population loss through a net international migration gain of
248,490 new residents from foreign countries and through nearly
300,000 more births than deaths.

MARKET PLACE: RALLY BY COMMODITIES SEEN AS SIGN GLOBAL ECONOMY WILL
REBOUND  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As cold weather finally wrapped around the Northeast,
the price of home heating oil jumped by just more than a penny
Tuesday, to 70.79 cents a gallon, a high for the year. The price of
copper inched up to 85.20 cents a pound, just a fraction of a cent
from its high for the year, while the price of crude oil rose 49
cents, to $26.82 a barrel, just below its high of $27.07 for the
year.
</P>
<P>
   As these prices and those of some other key commodities, like
nickel, make a run at the end of the year, some analysts say the
rally is built on a bet that the global economy, led by Asia and
Europe, will continue to rebound in 2000. This is a bet that many
economic forecasters say is a good one, but if the stronger growth
is not confirmed, then commodity prices, especially those outside
of oil, could slump.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasting commodity prices and assessing their effect on the
economy continues to be difficult, in part because commodities are
subject to many different pressures and, at the same time, play a
smaller role in the production of goods and services.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices are affected by demand, but it has been the decision
by the world's leading oil producers, including the OPEC countries,
to restrict output that has more than doubled the price this year.
Agricultural products are pretty much controlled by the supplies of
producers as demand remains constant.
</P>
<P>
   Industrial commodities, like copper, nickel and lumber, are more
finely tuned to demand. Consequently, their rally is a good sign
that the world economy is bouncing back from the global financial
crisis of 1997 and 1998. But their rise is not, as it has been in
the past, an early warning signal for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty impressive that some commodities are ending up the
year near their cycle peaks,'' said Dinsa Mehta, the managing
director for global commodities at Chase Manhattan Bank.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``much of this anticipates pressures; it is not a
response to growth; so much of this is reversible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The market,'' he added, ``has to see physical pressures, and
the market conviction on growth has to be confirmed.''
</P>
<P>
   William O'Neill, the director of futures research at Merrill
Lynch, put the outlook another way. ``The key point is that the
worst is over for commodities,'' he said. But he said that he
expected a continuation of the divergence in performance between
industrial commodities, which have thrived, and agricultural
commodities, which have slumped.
</P>
<P>
   What William E. Byers, the director of futures research at Bear
Stearns &AMP; Co., finds interesting about this year's rally,
especially in crude oil, gasoline and home heating oil, is that it
has not touched off ``any inflation psychology.'' He said he had
paid $1.69 a gallon for unleaded gasoline on Sunday night but,
``anecdotally I don't hear anyone complaining about the price of
gasoline.'' He said he suspected this was because the economy is
strong and consumers are feeling flush.
</P>
<P>
   These commodities, having rebounded from low levels, are showing
prices well above their averages for the last five years. The
five-year average for the near-term crude oil futures contract
traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange is $18.94 cents a
barrel, $7.88 below the current price, while the average for the
near-term futures contract for unleaded gasoline is 56.82 cents a
gallon, 15.81 cents below the current price. The price of heating
oil is 19.49 cents a gallon above the five-year average for the the
near-term futures contract of 51.30 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who are hyping the inflation impact of commodities are
barking up the wrong tree,'' O'Neill said.
</P>
<P>
   Mehta says commodity prices can match the performance of 1999,
which is set to be the first time since 1995 that the
Bridge/Commodity Research index of 17 commodities rose for the
year, up 6.7 percent through Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Byers and O'Neill contend that while 2000 should be an up year,
it will not be as good for overall commodity indexes. The major
reason is that the price of crude oil is not expected to come close
to matching the 122.6 percent jump it has made so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, agriculture prices are still in a slump. Cocoa hit
a 25-year low this year, grains are still low by historical
standards, and cotton is near its lows for the decade, O'Neill
said. While the price of coffee has jumped 14.5 percent since the
beginning of October, it is still up just 1 percent for the year.
Its current near-term futures price of $1.19 a pound is still below
the five-year average of $1.35 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think these numbers would be tough to match,'' Byers said of
the 1999 performance of the key commodity indexes. ``The caveat
would be if there is some crop problem that gets the grains off
their backs or foods get off their backs.''
</P>
<P>
   While copper and nickel, which have more then doubled in price
this year, continue to rise, the Bridge/Commodity Research Bureau
index of 13 raw industrial commodities, including tallow, tin, wool
tops and zinc, has dropped 3 percent from the 1999 high reached
near the end of November.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are out of the period of abject bearishness in commodities
and into a period of neutral to modest bullishness,'' O'Neill said.
``But I emphasize the word modest.''

GIULIANI CLAIMS VICTORY IN EFFORT TO END WELFARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By NINA BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announced on Tuesday that he
had fulfilled the pledge he made 18 months ago to end welfare as
New York City knows it by shifting thousands of recipients into
work, job training or treatment, and taking away benefits from the
rest.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said that all able-bodied welfare recipients without
infant children are now either in jobs or taking some steps to get
them. ``Today marks the milestone of replacing the culture of
dependency in New York City with the culture of work and
employment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But City Council members immediately challenged the way the
mayor was adding up the numbers, pointing out that fewer than a
quarter of the people he classified as able to work were actually
documented as working. For example, City Hall counted as successes
recipients who had merely been ordered to seek evaluation for work
or training programs. Charts provided by city officials failed to
provide enough information to clearly show how much of the shift
reflects real changes for welfare recipients and how much is a
product of reclassifying them.
</P>
<P>
   City Councilman Stephen DiBrienza said that while the mayor
implies that 137,542 people are now working for their benefits,
City Hall has stretched the definitions so much that ``for
thousands upon thousands of them, it simply means they got a
letter.'' The councilman added: ``They've created this tough piece
in search of a headline so the mayor can say he fulfilled his
promise, and I think it's complete hype.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping his welfare promise is of great importance to Giuliani,
who is the likely Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate next
year. He made the pledge in July 1998, vowing, ``By the year 2000,
New York will be the first city in the nation, on its own, to end
welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Giuliani never intended to push everyone off
public assistance. Roughly two-thirds of all recipients are
children, and thousands of adults are legally exempt from work
because of disabilities, old age or because they care for a child
younger than 3 months. But the mayor did want to go beyond the
federal government's workfare requirements by moving every
recipient who was willing and able into jobs or programs intended
to prepare them for jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In the last four months, the city's Human Resources
Administration has been under intense pressure to meet the mayor's
goal as he and the welfare commissioner, Jason Turner, defined it:
reducing to zero a target population of 48,141 adult recipients
considered able to work, or about 15 percent of those on the rolls
when the mayor made his pledge.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Giuliani declared that goal had been met. ``The most
important thing is, we have everyone engaged, either in working in
the private sector, working in the public sector, in the workfare
program, or, engaged in a process of being evaluated in order to
work,'' he said. ``The purpose of this is to make sure that people
if they can take care of themselves are given the opportunity to
take care of themselves.''

<P>
   For me, and I assume for most of you _ since whatever I'm
thinking so too is the nation _ it was difficult to know exactly
what to celebrate on Dec. 31, 1999. Do I celebrate the end of the
year, the end of the 20th century or the end of the millennium? I
chose the one remaining option, and therefore I assume so did most
of you: the end of the day. This made for significantly reduced
partying intensity. However, waking up on Saturday, knowing that
Friday was now over, I felt compelled to write about the past 2,000
years and the changes that would be wrought in this new age. This
was indeed a challenge to me as I desired to write the history of
humankind, past, present and future, without bothering to do any
research.
</P>
<P>
   A SHORT HISTORY OF THOUGHT  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is of course impossible to offer anything but a cursory look
at the history of thought in the few paragraphs I'm allotted here.
For more elaborate study see my book ``The Long History of
Thought'' or, for the enthusiast, ``The Very Long and Heavy History
of Thought, So Long You Can't Believe It.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Jan. 1, 0000, thought did not exist. Yes, there were
Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, but their one-word names keep them
from being taken seriously as philosophers. Think of them as the
early Greek equivalent of Cher, Liberace and Madonna: great
entertainers, but their views on the nature of the universe are
somehow not sticking.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Plato can't be faulted for naively thinking of the
world in terms of forms and shadows; technology was not advanced
enough for him to have known that the universe is composed of tiny
particles called ``futons.'' And think of poor Socrates, with his
simple answer to the question ``What is justice?'' There was just
no way for him to have foreseen a jury's $3 million payout to a
McDonald's customer who spilled a cup of too-hot coffee in her lap.
</P>
<P>
   Aristotelian thought dominated culture for 1,500 years and was
immediately dumped when it was discovered that the center of the
universe was not earth, as Aristotle had claimed, but was actually
Donald Trump. Aristotle's metaphysics were then succeeded by the
religious philosophy of the Roman Catholic Church, which created a
fervor that resulted in the creation of many great paintings and
sculptures, and inspired men to turn casual comments like ``I need
a little something over the sofa'' into monumental works of art. In
fact, it was Pope Sixtus IV who remarked to Michelangelo upon
seeing the Sistine Chapel for the first time, ``I said paint the
ceiling, not go nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   The dogma of the church was challenged in the mid-17th-century
by Rene Descartes' famous pronouncement ``Cogito ergo sum'' (``I am
nervous about having to add''), and the age of rationalism began.
Rationalism then gave way to empiricism, and David Hume declared
that it was impossible to know if anything existed at all, though
later he recanted when he stubbed his toe on a doorjamb.
</P>
<P>
   Thought continued unchanged until the end of the second
millennium, except for a brief moment in the early 20th century
when Ludwig Wittgenstein destroyed the foundation of all
philosophical thought, and people didn't know what to believe
anymore, causing them to feel lost, hopeless and fearful. This
resulted in the biggest clothes-buying spree the world has ever
seen.
</P>
<P>
   The third millennium, now well into its second day, appears to
have taken thought to new and unexpected extremes. The first of
such extremes appears to be that the fundamental philosophical
belief of the 1990s, the personal tattoo statement, is no longer
tenable, and 200,000 indelibly inked young people will be shipped
off to a special holding farm in Java. Out of concern for them,
they will be kept in the dark about the fact that the fad has
passed.
</P>
<P>
   MORALITY THROUGH THE CENTURIES
</P>
<P>
   The history of thought not only deals with philosophy but ethics
and morality as well. I offer the advanced student of moral history
the following summary:
</P>
<P>
   Roman era: anything goes
</P>
<P>
   Medieval era: nothing goes
</P>
<P>
   Renaissance: anything goes
</P>
<P>
   17th-century Spain: nothing goes
</P>
<P>
   18th-century France: anything goes
</P>
<P>
   19th-century England: nothing goes
</P>
<P>
   1920s America: anything goes
</P>
<P>
   1950s America: nothing goes
</P>
<P>
   1990s America: anything goes
</P>
<P>
   Even as rhythmic as these statistics are, it is impossible to
predict the moral tenor of even the next few years, because of the
Elvis factor. The Elvis factor is the tendency of an era with one
consistent and rigid moral philosophy to be upset and radically
altered by a simple, uneducated hillbilly with a new idea.
</P>
<P>
   COMMUNICATION IN THE THIRD MILLENNIUM
</P>
<P>
   Communication has changed so rapidly in the last 20 years, it's
almost impossible to predict what might occur even in the next
decade. E-mail, which now sends data hurtling across vast distances
at the speed of light, has replaced primitive forms of
communication such as smoke signals, which sent data hurtling
across vast distances at the speed of light. Let's suppose that you
want to say, ``I am a jerk.'' In the 18th century, you would have
to go around person to person and utter the phrase individually to
each one of them. However, here in the third millennium, with our
advances in telephone communication, it is possible to say, ``I am
a jerk'' to a thousand people at a time by forgetting to turn off
your cell phone and having it ring during a performance of ``Death
of a Salesman.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, there is now a sophisticated communication technique used
between men and women that eases marital strain and opens wide the
doors of understanding between the sexes. This new technique,
developed by psychologists and sociologists, is called
``listening.'' It will be interesting to see if the new technique
lasts or whether it will disappear and be replaced by older, more
traditional methods, such as ``leaving the room.''
</P>
<P>
   ART IN THE THIRD MILLENNIUM
</P>
<P>
   I sometimes wonder if a 19th-century artist could have imagined
a Picasso. I wonder if Raphael didn't one day scratch out a nice
Cubist doodle and toss it in the fireplace, or if Goya ever
conjured up a de Kooning, dismissed it and went on with his work. I
think not. It seems logically impossible for a thought to be
dreamed up before its time, even with the obvious catch that once
it is thought up, it is, by definition, its time.
</P>
<P>
   All this means nothing for the real world except that the art of
the third millennium is unknowable by us, just as the art of
Picasso was unknowable to Manet, though Cezanne might have, on one
odd night, dreamt it.

 &HT;    Braves the only place for closer's rehabilitation
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Now that the dust has settled somewhat, I come before
you today neither to condemn nor to defend John Loy Rocker. That
leaves me suspended in limbo on a subject that has aroused our
congregation of late, triggering such extremes to the point that
the mayors of two metropolitan cities leaped to the nearest soapbox
in a lather. Bill Campbell, of course, has a history of exercising
his larynx on any prominent subject, from mass murder to strip
joints. Now that the tempest has tempered to a degree, there are a
few thoughts that might be touched upon in the cold dawn.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the solutions proposed to pitcher Rocker, one that
fascinates me most is that he should ``resign from baseball.'' How
do you resign from baseball? It's a process that defies logic.
</P>
<P>
   I am reminded that the man who made the proposal, Henry Aaron,
once smashed a sportswriter in the face with a basket of fresh
strawberries, not for something the writer had written, but because
his boss had written something Aaron disliked. While no
sociological matters were involved in his act, it was rather
untoward. No penalty followed. There was no public outrage.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie White, the massive defensive end, made some socially
disturbing comments, but since he is an ordained minister, he
survived the backlash, and there was some. Latrell Sprewell
survived, yea, profited from a vicious attack on his coach. O.J.
Simpson survived murder. He still hasn't found the killer, although
he promised.
</P>
<P>
   There are some subjects, though, on which public utterance is
not acceptable, by white or black. When Rocker spoke, he pretty
much covered the whole canvas. Hardly anybody was left out. It
might surprise you, the number of e-mail correspondents who have
defended his right to free speech, not with what he said, but with
his right to say it.
</P>
<P>
   It would not be fair to Jeff Pearlman of Sports Illustrated to
say that Rocker was sandbagged. Apparently, he merely turned Rocker
on and couldn't turn him off. A hunting trip was what he'd come to
town to write about, and Rocker talked him right out of the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   On the Rocker side, I'm guessing. Here is this big country boy
feeling rather important. This big-time city writer has been sent
down to write a story about him. Him, John Loy Rocker, small-town
Southerner. He'd give him an earful of just what a big-time guy he
was. ``Showing off,'' kids would say. Whatever it was, there was no
excuse for revealing himself in such a light. And, I seriously
doubt that he believes a lot that he said, but there's no unsaying
it, drawing it back out of the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   What would have terrified me most would have been having to go
home and face my mother, now that she knew I used such volcanic
language.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, do you destroy a person for his opinions? Do
you throw his career out with the garbage? Trading is hardly the
remedy. About as far away as he could be sent would be Seattle, and
that isn't far enough. Wherever he goes, the picking apart would
start all over again, like vultures feasting on carrion. (Do they
play baseball in Iceland?) Wherever he goes, he becomes a
``foreigner'' himself.
</P>
<P>
   Conclusion here is that he would fare better in Atlanta, on home
ground, where damage control would be more humanely administered.
First, he goes before his teammates and eats humble pie. Confesses
his stupidity. Shut up and pitch again. Looking across the locker
room, facing teammates and Bobby Cox and his coaches will be enough
to bring him down to reality. You don't find the solution in
another clubhouse of strangers, staring and wondering what kind of
monster have we among us?
</P>
<P>
   He would fare far better under the compassionate hand of John
Schuerholz, a man who knows and realizes the precious talent
involved here. That's what general managers are for, dealing with
all manners of personnel, tidying up unsavory messes, pulling loose
parts back together again. You don't destroy a man because of his
opinions, approve of them or not.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker has damaged nobody more than himself. No one can do more
to repair the casualty than himself. If he handles it with
propriety, he'll make it back. If not, baseball will resign itself
from him.

 &HT;    Words tore asunder already-thin team ties
 &HT;    By Terence Moore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Let's stop the games. Many of those wringing their
hands over the world according to John Rocker aren't shocked by
what the Braves reliever told Sports Illustrated. They are peeved
that he left the shadows to share their thoughts in broad daylight.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I prefer Rocker over his instant critics, because at
least Rocker isn't a fraud.
</P>
<P>
   We've seen this before when Al Campanis, Jimmy ``The Greek''
Snyder, Marge Schott and other sports figures caused a phony burst
of national outrage over their words. If the past is indicative of
the future, this Rocker furor will last days instead of weeks,
before the secret Campanises, Synders and Schotts move on with the
rest of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   It already is happening. Soon after the public heard of Rocker
blasting minorities and foreigners in Sports Illustrated, the media
was flooded with Rocker critics before cameras and microphones.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, Atlanta's WXIA-TV ran an opinion poll that asked,
``Should major league baseball take disciplinary action against
John Rocker?'' Unlike the broad daylight of cameras and
microphones, those opinion polls are done in the shadows with
telephones.
</P>
<P>
   So much for outrage over Rocker. Of the near-record calls for
that Rocker poll, there were 19,960 nos and 9,827 yeses.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker isn't worth all of this. Not even close. He isn't the
president of anything. Neither is he a mighty clergyman or a
DiMaggio or a Koufax. He's a guy whose sphere of influence mostly
involves the speed and direction of a baseball.
</P>
<P>
   That said, there isn't a doubt that Rocker has to go. To the
Diamondbacks. To the White Sox. To the other side of Mars _ you
know, so he is as far away as possible from the bulk of humanity on
this planet that he apparently despises. Just send Rocker to
anywhere that isn't inside the Braves clubhouse, but only because
of the baseball stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves stuff, in particular.
</P>
<P>
   Although team harmony is overrated at the pro level, where the
Me Generation began long before it surfaced in the rest of society,
it just isn't wise to keep a player who in a national publication
referred to one of his teammates as ``a fat monkey.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus, if Rocker wants to sound like he's auditioning to become a
grand dragon or exalted leader of a militia group in Idaho, that's
his constitutional right. It just isn't wise to keep a player on a
team that might have seven of its eight regulars in the starting
lineup this season representing the various ethnic groups that
Rocker just ripped.
</P>
<P>
   The man wasn't exactly hugged by his peers before his remarks.
In fact, during my 15 years of covering Atlanta sports, I've never
seen a Braves player more disliked by his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Like most teams, the Braves have a kangaroo court that features
players fining each other small amounts for various offenses. One
player is the judge, and others serve as jurors and bailiffs during
these private affairs. They're fun affairs. Well, usually.
</P>
<P>
   During last season, Rocker tried to attack the judge during a
kangaroo court after a guilty verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The judge was African-American.
</P>
<P>
   Just a coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   As we know by now, Rocker will attack anybody.

   But it is clear _ mayors aside _ that art will continue. The
great moments in art history occur when the hitherto unthinkable
thought coalesces in the brain of someone capable of manifesting
it. Yes, something is waiting out there in the misty future, with
``unknown'' as its caption, that we cannot, no way, imagine. Once
the new art is created, however, it is up to us to ensure its
rightful place in the pantheon of art history by persecuting and
denouncing it.
</P>
<P>
   It is interesting to note that the current art scene, with its
bent toward video works, installations and performance, has
devastated the picture hook industry. In fact, one CEO of a popular
picture hook company, who used to vacation yearly in New York,
Paris and Venice, is now spending his summers at the New York,
Parisian and Venetian casinos in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   OUR WONDERFUL NEW MILLENNIUM
</P>
<P>
   The third millennium, with its exciting parties and fireworks,
puts to shame the incredibly dull first millennium and already
outshines the violent second millennium with a significantly
reduced statistic of accidental deaths by longbow. The parties and
celebrations surrounding the birth of this newest and best
millennium also point to its importance. There was no celebration
at the start of the first millennium, as it was not known that it
had begun, and the celebration at the end of the year 999 was muted
because the rotating, mirrored party ball had not yet been
invented.
</P>
<P>
   We can measure the impact and value of each age by looking at a
brief history of its inventions and accomplishments. It is
lamentable that there have been only three millenniums, and the
poor folk who lived before the ``age of millenniums'' thought they
were having a good time but are actually condemned to hell.
</P>
<P>
   Pre-first-millennium inventions:
</P>
<P>
   Dice
</P>
<P>
   First-millennium inventions:
</P>
<P>
   The windmill
</P>
<P>
   Second-millennium inventions:
</P>
<P>
   Eggplant parmigiana
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese finger trap
</P>
<P>
   Third-millennium inventions, since Jan. 1, 2000:
</P>
<P>
   Nine bug fixes on Windows 98
</P>
<P>
   MY DREAM FOR THE FUTURE
</P>
<P>
   My dream is simple. It is that this millennium, nay, even this
decade, will be the first in which we stop referring to centuries
by the one-off method. How many schoolboys have been perplexed
forever because we refer to the 1900s as the  &UR; 20th &LR; ? Why are the
1800s the  &UR; 19th century &LR; ? After all, when we are 39 years old and
someone asks us our age, we don't say, ``I'm starting my 40th
year!'' Why must we pause and recalculate every time we mention a
century and have to figure out that the 17th century, even though
it begins with a 16, is not really the 16th century because the 1st
century, which has no ``1'' in front of it, actually counts as a
century and the century that has a ``1'' in front of it is really
the 2nd century?
</P>
<P>
   So right now let's start calling the third millennium the
 &UR; second &LR;  millennium. After all, doesn't this millennium start with
a 2? You ask, so how will we refer to the first millennium, the one
that begins with all the zeros? Easy. We will  &UR; not &LR;  refer to it. We
will pretend it never existed. There is no point referring to an
era whose biggest accomplishment was the windmill, and you know
what? We'll get along fine without it. Problem solved.
</P>
<P>
   A SAD NOTE
</P>
<P>
   I hesitate to point out that by the end of this, the  &UR; second &LR; 
millennium, we will all be dead. This is especially sad to me, as
my life seems to be much more valuable than other people's, what
with my special love of flowers and poetry. Worse, it is
discomforting to think that once I'm gone, all my things will be
owned by someone else. There will be people living in my house,
wearing ridiculous hairdos, who will think of me and my age as
hideously old-fashioned and moronically stupid, and who will look
at our newspapers and see ads for clothes-storage shrink-wrap
suction machines that will make them roar with laughter. On the
other hand, it is comforting to note that these people will also be
frighteningly stupid, sitting on their ``sunflower'' chairs,
wearing their ``wigwam'' slippers and eating brain-enhancing toad
power-pellets just as embarrassing as anything we ever sat on, wore
or consumed. And perhaps you and I will be a few atoms in the
raindrops that fall on them and ruin their day.
</P>
<P>
   A FINAL THOUGHT
</P>
<P>
   When I was a boy, I calculated how old I would be in the year
2000. I was shocked to see that when the millennium arrived, I was
fully 10 years younger than I expected to be. But then, I'm in show
business. Some of us are beginning our lives, some are in the
middle, and some are at the end (I have a proof of this statement,
but it will not fit in the margins). But it is wonderful to think
that if one day all of us humans, regardless of race or creed,
could lay down our differences and create a human chain by circling
the globe and holding hands, we would all come down with exactly
the same cold.

COMMENTARY: DECEMBER WOMEN, MAY MEN
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ I didn't buy the hype last summer that Hollywood
was finally discovering the sex appeal of older actresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about time moviemakers, who blithely pair older leading
men with twentysomething actresses, got with the program,'' People
magazine chided in a cover story. ``Some 21 million American women,
who thanks to diet and exercise look and feel better than their
forerunners, are now in their 40s, and they're eager to see the
fullness of their lives reflected on screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Piffle! Hollywood will always like young flesh.
</P>
<P>
   But I figured I'd ask the Colette of prime time, David E.
Kelley, who has created a galaxy of smart, sexy female characters
on his TV shows, ``The Practice'' and ``Ally McBeal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some say I get into the minds of women,'' Kelley says dryly.
``Others say I'm out of my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The writer-producer has been on top of a lot of trends about
women. The scary-thin trend, with his actresses Calista Flockhart
and Lara Flynn Boyle. The fat-can-be-sexy trend, with Camryn
Manheim of ``The Practice.'' The over-40-can-be-sultry trend with
his luminous wife, Michelle Pfeiffer.
</P>
<P>
   And now, the younger-men-can-too-find-older-women-hot trend. The
boyish wonder of TV has been writing steamy tangles between
December women and May men.
</P>
<P>
   Not, says the 43-year-old, drawn from personal experience. ``The
closest I came to a May-December romance was as a teen-ager in a
movie theater when I saw `The Summer of '42' with that old, old
woman, Jennifer O'Neill,'' he says. ``What was she, 28?
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, sexiness has always been as much mental as physical.
If women can exude sexuality at 40, it's irrelevant to me if they
do not have 20-year-old hard bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   He began three seasons ago on ``Ally'' with Dyan Cannon as
Whipper, a judge dating Fish, the young law partner whose fetish is
neck wattles. This year Farrah Fawcett did a guest shot as a
sizzling client who kissed her young lawyer, Billy.
</P>
<P>
   Over at the more intense Boston law firm in ``The Practice,''
Holland Taylor won an Emmy last year playing Roberta Kittleson,
another sexually charged judge who can turn law clerks to jelly
just by looking at them. She has been dating the younger lawyer
Jimmy Berluti, and even had a seminude scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only wish they had shown me completely naked,'' Ms. Taylor
says. ``How hot would that have been?''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike actresses such as Rene Russo and Kim Basinger, who look
eerily the way they did at 30, Ms. Taylor ``cooks,'' as she puts
it, while looking her age.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 56 _ I would commit an ax murder before I'd lie about my
age,'' she says, adding that she and her friends in their 40s and
50s are ``sexually active in a significant and profound way, much
more so than my friends in their 20s and 30s.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley recalls seeing Ms. Taylor in the film ``One Fine Day,''
playing Ms. Pfeiffer's mother: ``There was a scene where Holland
expressed her own animalistic intent toward George Clooney, and I
thought, yeah, she's sexy. She could give that daughter some
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Taylor and Ms. Cannon, both single, say they date younger
men and get fan mail from lustful young men _ and admiring women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have women following me to the bathroom, thanking me for
inspiring them,'' Ms. Cannon says.
</P>
<P>
   The 62-year-old actress, who was once married to a much older
Cary Grant, now reverses the roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young men adore me,'' she says, with her trilling laugh. ``I
was just on the phone with my niece who turned 20. She said she
would never date a younger man. I said, `Just wait, you'll change
your mind.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Taylor said she had a serious romance last year with a man
20 years younger that ``blew apart'' because she was crimped by
convention. ``You think, `It can't work, our lives won't fit,' ''
she says. ``Then, you have a sunburst of revelation that all of
that is untrue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women can be glorious after their youthful jiggly-ness. Simone
Signoret looked like the side of an old barn in Normandy, but
drop-dead sexy. If I had Helen Mirren's bosom, I would be the
happiest woman in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   I tell Kelley that his wife once said that, given Hollywood
biases, her career would be over by the time her daughter hit
kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
   ``She says that to me, too,'' he laughs. ``And I say, `Yeah,
yeah.' ''

A `FANTASIA' FOR THE MTV GENERATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Jan. 2)  
 (Eds: Joseph Horowitz has chronicled the popularization of
classical music between the wars in his book ``Understanding
Toscanini.'')  
 (bl)  
 By JOSEPH HOROWITZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1939, composer Paul Hindemith visited Hollywood, full of
enthusiasm for Walt Disney's first full-length cartoon feature,
``Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.'' Hindemith headed for the
studio in which Disney and Leopold Stokowski were working on the
second full-length cartoon feature, ``Fantasia.'' But its cartoon
renderings of Bach and Beethoven repulsed Hindemith; he thought the
new medium was being abused by philistines.
</P>
<P>
   Hindemith's highbrow condemnation was shortsighted. It was the
Disney-Stokowski melange of longhair and Mickey Mouse that was
prescient. ``Fantasia,'' completed in 1940, proved at least as
enduring as anything Hindemith composed on settling in the United
States in the same year.
</P>
<P>
   Disney lavished $2.3 million on ``Fantasia.'' For its New York
premiere, the Broadway Theater was equipped with 90 speakers to
convey Stokowski's Philadelphia Orchestra in ``Fantasound'' _ an
early form of stereo. Special engagements were booked coast to
coast. Time magazine ran a cover story. But ``Fantasia'' was a
financial disaster, and (to Stokowski's dismay) Disney scuttled
plans for a sequel.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``Fantasia'' lived on. Reissued in 1956, it turned a profit.
The home video release, in 1991, was a best-seller.
</P>
<P>
   And now Disney's nephew, Roy Disney, has created
``Fantasia/2000,'' a second animated classical music medley.
Previewed at Carnegie Hall in December, it has just opened at Imax
theaters; a general theatrical release is being considered for
June.
</P>
<P>
   No one today would demand the high-culture pedigree Hindemith
looked for 60 years ago. But what to look for instead? What
relationship should ``Fantasia/2000'' adopt toward its precursor?
Toward the new millennium? These questions afflict the film itself.
However unwittingly, it exposes the hiatus between two cultural
moments.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of ``Fantasia/2000'' read like a homage. Mickey, as the
Sorcerer's Apprentice, magnificently restored both visually and
sonically, makes a repeat appearance. Of the seven other episodes,
all new, a rendering of the story of Noah's ark, to music by Elgar,
furnishes a comparable star vehicle for Donald Duck. The opening
segment, to Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, is all shapes and colors:
abstract, like the opening Bach Toccata and Fugue in D minor of
1940.
</P>
<P>
   If other echoes of ``Fantasia'' _ volcanoes and earthquakes, a
demonic apparition, an animal ballet _ seem redundant,
``Fantasia/2000'' elsewhere strives to be innovative. The
landscapes of Respighi's ``Pines of Rome'' produce seascapes: an
epiphany of swimming and flying humpback whales whose lifelike
three-dimensionality _ they do not look like ``cartoons'' _ is
computer-generated.
</P>
<P>
   At the opposite extreme, Gershwin's ``Rhapsody in Blue'' is an
exercise in ``flat'' animation inspired by the pen and ink drawings
of Al Hirschfeld. This wealth of variety risks an absence of unity.
</P>
<P>
   In place of the irreplaceable Stokowski, ``Fantasia/2000''
features James Levine conducting the Chicago Symphony. No less than
Disney, Stokowski defined ``Fantasia.'' He was (needless to say)
more iconic than any present-day popularizer of classical music.
His distinctive sonic signature _ opulent, smooth-skinned _ helped
unify the musical content. (The ``Nutcracker'' and ``Pastoral''
Symphony performances are unlike anyone else's.) The film's very
repertory, ranging from Bach-Stokowski to the bold inclusion of
Stravinsky's ``Rite of Spring,'' was Stokowski repertory.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, the repertory is thinner; there is nothing
remotely as challenging as the ``Rite.'' And except for the
12-minute Gershwin and the 2-minute finale of Saint-Saens'
``Carnival of the Animals,'' all the music is highly truncated. We
get 3 minutes of the first movement of the Beethoven and 10 minutes
of the Respighi. The rest of the program consists of a swift
conflation of Elgar's ``Pomp and Circumstance'' Marches (with
interpolated chorus and earsplitting obbligato by Kathleen Battle _
a gaffe), and parts of Shostakovich's Second Piano Concerto and
Stravinsky's ``Firebird'' Suite. The closing credits are much
longer than the Beethoven and Saint-Saens excerpts put together.
</P>
<P>
   The film totals 70 minutes, and its brevity is a statement of
its own. In ``Fantasia'' (which also abbreviated most of its
music), both the ``Rite of Spring'' and Beethoven's ``Pastoral''
were formidably extensive. The total length was two hours. As the
movie was first shown, there was also an intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Disney, in a recent conversation, confirmed what the
evidence suggests: ``There's no getting away from the fact that MTV
has affected us all and that audiences are a little bit more
impatient than they used to be. We wanted to err on the side of
brevity rather than wear out our welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   For Disney, whose favorite Walt Disney film is ``Fantasia,''
``Fantasia/2000'' was a labor of love. The patron saint of Disney
animation, he supervised the entire nine-year project. One thing he
worried about was whether to incorporate episodes from ``Fantasia''
beyond ``The Sorcerer's Apprentice.'' He had intended also to
include the ``Nutcracker'' Suite. ``But when we spliced it in, we
discovered that everything suddenly slowed down when the
`Nutcracker' showed up on the screen,'' he said. ``It became very
clear that with the exception of `The Sorcerer's Apprentice,' the
old and new material couldn't really coexist.''
</P>
<P>
   Revisiting the ``Nutcracker'' Suite on home video makes the
problem understandable. Its 14 minutes _ longer than anything in
``Fantasia/2000'' _ are non-narrative: a patient and poetic
exploration of how forms _ hovering fairies, darting fishes,
floating flowers, dancing mushrooms, leaping radishes _ follow
music, whose arabesques and piquancies are subtly corporealized.
</P>
<P>
   The episodes of ``Fantasia/2000,'' by contrast, tell stories.
Even the abstract animation for Beethoven's Fifth has a scenario: a
contest of light and dark flying triangular shapes (say,
butterflies vs. bats). Like Noah's ark to Elgar, the Steadfast Tin
Soldier to Shostakovich is a linear narrative. ``Rhapsody in Blue''
is (of course) a 1920s New York tableau of subways and skyscrapers,
but it's at the same time an interpolated day in the life of three
men and a little girl. The ``Firebird'' is a saga of nature
(symbolized by a sprite and an elk) despoiled and reborn. Only
Respighi's whales and Saint-Saens' flamingos are as unencumbered as
the ``Nutcracker'' fairies and flowers. In such action-packed
company, it is no wonder that the ``Nutcracker'' was found to slow
down the show.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Also, a series of celebrities, including Steve Martin, Bette
Midler and Itzhak Perlman, take part on camera as hosts.
(``Fantasia'' had a single, laconic host: the American composer and
critic Deems Taylor, who never appeared on screen.) So there is
variety galore to go with the brevity and speed. So much
explanatory mediation _ the stories, the celebrity introductions _
circumscribes creative engagement with the music. The difference
between ``Fantasia'' and ``Fantasia/2000'' is the difference
between a dialogue with Jack Paar and a brisk ``interview'' with
David Letterman, between reading a book and answering questions
posed by a CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, the ``Fantasia'' concept is a grand exercise in
choreography. In fact, Ponchielli's ``Dance of the Hours,'' in the
1940 ``Fantasia,'' is a sublime sendup of choreographic art,
crowned by a dashing pas de deux for alligator and hippopotamus. It
is Petipa at the zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Equally inspired is the close of the ``Pastoral'' Symphony,
marrying the soaring apotheosis of Beethoven's coda with Helios'
chariot of the sun. Earlier in the same work, the grace and majesty
of the music (wonderfully conveyed by Stokowski) are mirrored by
the winged Pegasus on high. With their invocations of classical
ballet and mythology, these sequences are polyvalent; they invite a
gamut of responses from a variety of audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside such sophisticated alligators, hippos and ostriches,
the dancing flamingos of ``Fantasia/2000'' are a vaudeville team.
Juxtaposed with Zeus and Pan, unicorns and centaurs, the sprite and
elk of the ``Firebird'' are impoverished representations of Nature.
This diminished cultural vocabulary diminishes the music thus
accompanied. In every way _ as heard, as ``visualized'' _ it
registers less impressively.
</P>
<P>
   One sympathizes with Disney's predicament: revisiting a 1940
entertainment, he is swimming upstream. In his charmed partnership
with Stokowski, Uncle Walt was buoyed by faith in the public and
its capacity for discrimination and uplift. Disney and Stokowski
were visionaries emboldened by self-made success to pursue
technologies _ films and the phonograph _ that would reach, as
Stokowski once put it, ``the greatest number of men, women and
children all over the world.'' This was the day of the popularizers
_ of the Book-of-the-Month Club and music appreciation, of radio's
``American School of the Air'' and ``University of Chicago Round
Table,'' all brimming with confidence that quality would find an
audience.
</P>
<P>
   None of this would be worth belaboring if ``Fantasia/2000'' were
a sell-out to 21st-century marketing exigencies. But it is sincere,
not meretricious. As family entertainments go, it is more creative
than formulaic. It eschews violence and sexuality. It actually
conveys a modicum of innocence. At least one episode _ the Tin
Soldier _ achieves a seamless integration of image, narrative and
music. If this segment is less endearing than ``The Sorcerer's
Apprentice,'' it is because the music is less endearing, and
because the stoic Tin Soldier is no Mickey Mouse. In the truncated
``Firebird,'' where the abbreviations hurt more but the music is
stronger, newcomers stand a chance of becoming hooked on the
intensity and grandeur of Stravinsky's score.
</P>
<P>
   In sum, ``Fantasia/2000'' is a transitional achievement,
mirroring a cultural moment itself transitional. Will audiences
today buy it? One hopes so, if only because, according to Roy
Disney, the people who created ``Fantasia/2000'' are eager to begin
the next one. This would be the best possible outcome for
``Fantasia/2000.'' Disney should start with the restored
``Nutcracker'' he this time discarded _ all 14 minutes of it _ and
let ``Fantasia'' 1940 set the pace for a series of longer and more
patient animated episodes.
</P>
<P>
   He should also include some real 21st-century music, and not
just of the popular variety. If Stanley Kubrick could use space-age
Ligeti (in ``2001''), why not Disney? How about giving the Disney
animators a crack at something genuinely brain-bending and
ear-curdling, like the computer-synthesized music of the
contemporary French composer Tristan Murail? Stokowski insisted
that young people were more open-minded than their elders; were he
around today, he would certainly have come up with a few untamed
selections of his own.
</P>
<P>
   By accentuating brevity, the Disney team has attempted to make a
virtue of a necessity. But the brevity of ``Fantasia/2000'' is not
a virtue; the film  &UR; feels &LR;  short. Whether the brevity is a
necessity is an important 21st-century question. Let us hope Disney
will have the opportunity to prove himself wrong.

EXPERTS DOUBT CYBERCRIMINALS WILL DISRUPT COMPUTERS THIS WEEKEND  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Though still maintaining a nervous vigilance,
computer security experts in the government and private sectors
were breathing a little easier Tuesday, as almost no evidence had
yet materialized that hackers or terrorists were plotting
widespread disruption of computer networks over the New Year's
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Since midsummer, concern has been raised, sometimes with a tone
of alarm, that cybercriminals and political terrorists would mark
the rollover to the new millennium by planting various kinds of
malicious software in networks and computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   Very little evidence of such activity, however, has surfaced in
recent weeks, and Tuesday the Government's National Infrastructure
Protection Center said it expected no ``large-scale U.S.
infrastructure disruptions'' from Year 2000, or Y2K, computer
failures during the next few weeks. Moreover, because of greatly
heightened surveillance that is planned for computer networks
around the globe on New Year's Eve and the following days, many
experts say that now would actually be the worst time to attempt an
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the federal agency also said it was preparing for
a possible increase in criminal activity, in part because of
heightened media attention to Y2K threats.
</P>
<P>
   The agency identified four viruses that it said were of
particular concern. The first three, known as Microsoft Word macro
viruses, use a programming language inside the word processing
program to spread through networks. The fourth, identified as PC
CIH, is an older program that can seriously damage infected
machines.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday an administration official said that despite the fact
that no widespread attacks were expected there is still concern
about the potential for damage from malicious programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The criminal element has latched on to cyber-intrusion as a
good avenue,'' said the official, who spoke on the condition that
he not be identified. ``Obviously, this is an issue of concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Fithen, manager of the Computer Emergency Response Team
Coordination Center at Carnegie Mellon University, said: ``Right
now we're not seeing anything out of the ordinary. For Jan. 1, the
biggest thing we anticipate is computer viruses that have targeted
that date to execute.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Government official in charge of protecting the
nation's electronic infrastructure said he knew of no documented
cases in which malicious software had been implanted during efforts
to fix Year 2000 errors.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, various experts had voiced concerns that in
the frenzy to make repairs to software, a few rogue programmers
hired as temporary workers might secretly build in ``back doors''
that could later be exploited by criminals to invade networks
without triggering computer security systems.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the Gartner Group, a computer consulting and market
research firm, predicted at least one theft of $1 billion next year
directly resulting from this year's repairs.
</P>
<P>
   The threat alone can be costly. Even if would-be intruders fail
to exploit such a back door, an organization that suspects that its
software has been compromised must assign its best engineers to
systematically examine massive amounts of code for tiny,
hard-to-find alterations.
</P>
<P>
   However, Bruce Schneier, president of Counterpane Internet
Security Inc. in San Jose, Calif., said such back-door attacks have
been extremely rare, and last week Richard Clarke, the president's
national coordinator for computer infrastructure security and
counter-terrorism, said the government had not documented a single
such security breach.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Gartner Group's computer security experts conceded a
lack of evidence for secret back doors. ``I've heard lots of
stories,'' said William Spernow, the research director for
Gartner's information security strategies group. ``But when I have
asked for the code, I've gotten nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   One computer security firm that has assessed the added risk from
Y2K-related viruses and security attacks estimated this week that
the odds of a major ``virus event'' for the period were about 1 in
14, or 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The firm, ICSA.Net, also placed odds of a single attacker
breaching 100 or more computer sites over the weekend at 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Several antivirus software companies Tuesday said that while
they would not rule out the possibility of a widespread destructive
event over the weekend, they had not seen evidence of such viruses
yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing happened over Christmas, which may be a pretty good
indication that nothing major will happen on Jan. 1,'' said Vincent
Gullotto, director of Network Associates' Advert response team.

THE EFFECTS OF AGING, VIEWED UNBLINKINGLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Jan. 2)  
 (bl)  
 By VICKI GOLDBERG

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The demographics of nudity in the arts have never
quite matched the demographics of whatever population the arts were
playing in. In ancient Greece, young men displayed their every
charm in stone for a couple of centuries before naked young women
were allowed to join them. In late-18th-century neo-Classicism,
warriors tended to doff all their clothes while their wives or the
women they had brought to grief, both of whom probably outnumbered
them by war's end, generally remained covered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nude'' commonly signifies young women with exquisite curves.
In photography, the number of male nudes has increased in recent
years but is still disproportionately small. Nude children, too.
And elderly nudes have remained almost nonexistent, even as the
number of elderly and their life span increased. However, there are
signs of change.
</P>
<P>
   Two current shows in the Chelsea section of Manhattan, ``John
Coplans'' (17 photographs) at Andrea Rosen Gallery and Manabu
Yamanaka's ``Gyahtei: Age'' (16 photographs) at Stephan Stux
Gallery (both through Jan. 22) expose the effects of aging on the
flesh without blinking, hesitation or pity _ and too explicitly to
publish in a family newspaper. No doubt some people will be
uncomfortable in the presence of these photographs, particularly
Yamanaka's. The discomfort goes to the core of our culturally
determined being.
</P>
<P>
   Coplans presents five large, full-frontal images of his own
torso from chest to shins, with his hands on his knees, each body
divided in two horizontally with a white space between the two
sections. One of the images is apparently a union of two slightly
different poses: a body divided against itself. The pose
insistently puts the genitals smack at the center of attention,
while the halo of hairs along the arms and legs fuzzes the body's
outlines and activates the surface. Mottled skin, fine lines along
the wrists and hands, and gray pubic hair betray the subject's age,
and the black-and-white medium turns the flesh entirely to gray.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the pictures are of fingers only, usually two of
them pointing straight down. These finger exercises struck me as
amusingly anthropomorphic games. Positioned at a slight angle, two
fingers could be striding legs beneath a pompous belly (actually
the lower part of the hand). Two fingers bent, with the thumb
sticking out between them, look like the lower half of a naked old
woman sitting astride a protuberance that happens to have a
thumbnail.
</P>
<P>
   Coplans, born in 1920, was a respected art critic, editor and
curator before he started photographing. In 1979 he threw over his
previous career, and in 1984 he began a series of portraits of
himself that he has continued to this day. Well, not exactly his
 &UR; self &LR; , but his body. Dare one equate the body with the self in a
time when both body and self have become so malleable? In any
event, Coplans never includes his face, so that identifying him by
any of a number of intimate anatomical details could only occur if
you happened to run across him in the nude.
</P>
<P>
   By the current standards promulgated by advertising theology and
health-club dogma, Coplans' body is both heretical and slipshod.
Among other deviations from the latest book of bodily etiquette,
his abs long ago went into hiding, just about every available
surface of his skin has sprouted an untidy crop of hair and, worst
of all, he is too old. When these pictures were first shown, it was
not uncommon to hear people, some of whom knew the photographer,
remark that it was really a bit too much to show off at his age,
and who wanted to look at it?
</P>
<P>
   The assumption, which I confess I shared, was that only perfect
bodies should be displayed. And perhaps outrageous ones. The body
had already become a template for photographic revelation,
agitation and disparagement. Robert Mapplethorpe was exposing
homosexual practices, Joel-Peter Witkin concentrating on obese
figures and amputees, Jeffrey Silverthorne photographing in the
morgue. Coplans' body was probably sufficiently aged to inspire a
degree of unease in those who were planning to stay young forever,
but it could not match the voltage of the shocking discoveries that
were then current.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he presented a calm alternative to the artificial
perfection that blares at us from every billboard, and he has since
proved several times that age and imperfection can be stirring
vehicles for photography, most notably in the friezes of his
twisting body exhibited at PS 1 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   His ceaseless investigation of his own body, split into pieces
and often enlarged to monumental size, has actually been a serial
investigation of form, the kind of artistic endeavor he wrote about
in his days as a critic. Not that the pictures were abstract,
though a few poses were hard to read, and a picture of his feet
gigantically filling the space could transform them into a kind of
symbol for humankind and its ability to stand on a mere two. The
body photographs stubbornly remained images of his aging flesh, and
looking at them became a kind of back-and-forth between the
artistic, partly theoretical intent and the literally bare facts of
a body going to pot.

<P>
   The work was, and is, so formal that some of the natural and
some of the socially decreed reactions to bodies and to age are
damped down, and by now his anatomy is so familiar that whatever
shock value it did have is vitiated, but it is still a body, and
there is no way to turn off every response to flesh. The pictures
inevitably invite voyeuristic curiosity, a whiff of exhibitionism,
a nagging awareness of the human condition.
</P>
<P>
   Yamanaka's subjects are much older, and his full-frontal
photographs of the entire figures of nude Japanese women isolated
on a white ground are even more revealing and more aggressively
naked. They have already proved too disturbing for some viewers,
possibly because the female nude has traditionally been closely
associated with youthful sexuality. These women, all between the
ages of 90 and 100, are stooped and bony, with virtually hairless
bodies, and the skin from beneath the breasts to the pelvis hangs
in loose folds as if it were crepe. They look directly at the
camera, and thus at us, with remarkably varied expressions: two
present great open-mouthed, toothless smiles, one purses her lips
and raises her brows, one looks pained.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese respect age more than Americans do; indeed,
families in Japan have always cared for their elderly and are far
less likely to send a relative to a nursing home. But many Japanese
women now work and are no longer available, so older people
sometimes advertise for caretakers. Yamanaka, who is in his 40s,
answered several of these ads and for five years worked as a
volunteer helping aged people. He photographed women rather than
men because he found them beautiful. Some told him that he was only
the second man who had ever seen their bodies, the first being
their husbands.
</P>
<P>
   It is probably easier to find these women beautiful if you have
a personal attachment to them. Even without that, there is
something admirable, if puzzling, in their willingness to be looked
at so directly. Why were they willing to pose, to be seen by
strangers when they had so seldom been seen before? Gratitude to
Yamanaka? Acceptance of their bodies and their fate? Women who
frequent a gym could tell you that dangerously overweight or
shriveled-up older women are perfectly comfortable padding about in
their skins with strangers of the same sex; I would hope men are
the same. It comes as a great relief to think that in this
anorexia-bulimia, diet-fad, plastic-surgery society, women whose
bodies have given way before the onslaught of age might say at
last, ``That's who I am, and it's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   If Yamanaka's pictures are unnerving, which they may well be at
first, that is in part an index to attitudes about age and the fact
that even diet and exercise cannot stave it off forever. Partly it
is because few people have seen bodies  &UR; that &LR;  ancient, that
ineluctably set on the road to death, a highway that frightens
nearly everyone. Viewers may also identify in some obscure fashion:
will I look like that some day? Only if I live that long. Until
science discovers the fountain of youth, age will exact a price and
bring fear and sorrow to those not yet in its embrace. As the poet
Gerard Manley Hopkins wrote to a child named Margaret who cried
when the leaves fell in autumn, ``It is the blight man was born
for/ It is Margaret you mourn for.''
</P>
<P>
   In a time obsessed with bodies, as baby boomers work hard to
outfox time with step machines and scalpels, an older population is
becoming increasingly difficult to deny or ignore. Film, television
and advertisers have been forced for commercial reasons to
recognize the extended life span. The older body was one of the
last body taboos, a taboo that was bound to be broken in the age of
show-and-tell everything.
</P>
<P>
   So it has been. In the 1970s Imogen Cunningham took pictures of
the elderly, including a few nudes, and Anne Noggle began
photographing the aging process, including that of her own naked
body. More recently, Joyce Tenneson saw older male and female nudes
as beautiful, sorrowful and immensely dignified. Donigan Cumming
photographed a woman of advanced age in the nude for several years
as she declined, as well as some older men in staged situations.
Miyako Isiuchi's book ``1906'' is a pictorial study of a naked,
elderly Butoh master, vastly wrinkled, hugely spotted, but
portrayed with the utmost reverence.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the old can be looked upon as beautiful, a word that needs
to be revised and updated repeatedly. The press, and Viagra, have
begun spreading the news that senior citizens can even be sexy. In
Paris this November, Erwin Olaf's photographs of une femme d'une
certaine age in cheesecake poses _ in a tub, for instance, with a
few soapsuds at strategic points _ is reported to have caused a
stir but not delight. But, hey, do you think that if a construction
worker whistled at a gray-haired woman he would get an angry
feminist response?
</P>
<P>
   The generation that warned people not to trust anyone over 30
believed old bodies, like old cars, should be traded in for newer
models or sent to the junk heap. Yet age is coming out of the
closet _ even onto gallery walls _ because the old have reversed
the natural course of things and are multiplying. Will attitudes to
old bodies change when more people find themselves wearing them?
Stay tuned; the answer's on its way.

 &HT;    Panel soon will begin inquiry into A&AMP;M bonfire
 &HT;    By Ralph K.M. Haurwitz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Twelve young people died and 27 others were
injured when logs stacked for a bonfire at Texas A&AMP;M University
collapsed last month. Leo Linbeck Jr., who is in charge of figuring
out why, said Tuesday that the hands-on work of the inquiry will
begin soon.
</P>
<P>
   Linbeck, a construction executive from Houston who is chairman
of a special investigative commission, said the panel is close to
negotiating agreements with engineering and investigative companies
that it intends to hire. The five-member panel has lined up
McKinsey &AMP; Co., an international management-consulting firm, to
supervise the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is scheduled to have the second in a series of
public meetings Tuesday in College Station. Linbeck said the
discussion would focus on the tasks necessary to figure out why the
giant woodpile collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Two broad lines of inquiry are planned: one dealing with
physical issues, to be undertaken by engineering specialists, and a
second dealing with investigative matters, to be conducted by
specialists in that field.
</P>
<P>
   Linbeck declined to identify the companies under consideration
because agreements have not been firmed up. McKinsey offered its
services for free, but the commission plans to pay the other
companies. Linbeck said the panel expects to produce a budget in
the next couple of weeks. The university has agreed to cover the
costs of the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the engineering matters, Linbeck said: ``Basically,
it's the work required to identify and evaluate the design that was
intended to be built for the bonfire and to analyze its structural
efficacy. Another task is to determine what was built and determine
if it was at variance with what was intended to be built.''
</P>
<P>
   Engineers will try to determine whether any differences between
the intended design and the structure as built contributed to the
Nov. 18 collapse, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigative side of the inquiry will involve a review of
witness statements given to authorities, news articles,
photographs, videotapes and other documentation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, students are expected to be interviewed. The ``red
pots'' _ 18 seniors and juniors in charge of the project _ have
thus far declined to be interviewed by reporters. The panel has no
subpoena or legal powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps I'm naive,'' Linbeck said. ``I don't expect any
resistance to cooperating to the fullest. I hope I'm not surprised.
In my judgment, it's in everyone's best interest to find out what
caused the collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   He said interviews would be conducted in private but that
transcripts, videotapes or other documentation of interviews would
be released to reporters, although perhaps not until the inquiry is
completed.
</P>
<P>
   It has been almost six weeks since the collapse, and the
commission has not begun combing through more than 2,000 documents
assembled by A&AMP;M officials under the Texas Open Records Act. But
Linbeck said he is not concerned about the pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my experience in life that if you get well organized, you
can go faster than if you start out poorly organized,'' he said.

 &HT;    Dunn's blitzing Bulldogs
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Wherever defensive mastermind Joe Lee Dunn goes, great
defenses seem to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn is in his fourth season of being in charge of the
Mississippi State defense, which finished the regular season ranked
No. 1 in the country. The year before Dunn arrived on campus _ 1995
_ the Bulldogs had the worst-rated defense in the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteenth-ranked Mississippi State (9-2) plays Clemson (6-5) on
Thursday in the Peach Bowl. The game will feature a matchup between
Dunn and Clemson offensive guru Tommy Bowden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went up against (Dunn) a number of years when I was (an
assistant at Auburn), and unpredictability is what makes his
defenses successful,'' said Bowden, Clemson's head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a question of if he is going to apply the pressure
on the offense. It's a matter of how he is going to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unpredictability and successful risk-taking is what landed the
Bulldogs on the top of the chart among the country's defenses.
Mississippi State surrendered a national-best 222.5 yards total
offense per game, including an average of 66.9 yards rushing.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs are the only major-college team to use five
defensive backs on every play, including goal-line situations. The
caliber of play by Mississippi State cornerbacks Robert Bean and
Fred Smoot _ who both made first-team All-SEC _ allows the defense
to take chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two guys make defenses good, no matter what you do,''
Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
   With Bean and Smoot often in man-to-man coverage, the rest of
the defense can do what a Dunn-coached defense is famous for _
blitzing.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Dunn) blitzes the corners, he blitzes the linebackers, he
blitzes the trainers ... I swear he came off the sidelines once and
blitzed himself,'' Clemson offensive coordinator Rich Rodriguez
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers have cut out plays to make handling Mississippi
State's blitzing schemes less difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``The style of defense that Mississippi State plays allows for
big plays, but no one has been able to take advantage of them
consistently this season,'' Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs, who started out 8-0 this season, have allowed more
than 20 points in two games, with the season-high being 22 in a
victory over Kentucky. The defensive domination brings smiles to
the faces of the Mississippi State players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling you right now, we can match up with Clemson man on
man,'' safety Ashley Cooper said. ``Our defense ... we just have to
be aware, keep our eyes open and don't fall asleep. We're not the
No. 1 defense in the country for nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn, a native of Columbus, said his free-wheeling defensive
style is basically the same as when he was an assistant at
Tennessee-Chattanooga in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden said the main difference he has noticed this season is
that Dunn puts more pressure on the wide receivers with his
defensive backs at the line of scrimmage, allowing for fewer screen
passes and quick slants.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn said preparing for Clemson has been difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got more plays ... a phone book won't hold all their
plays,'' Dunn said. ``It's mind-boggling (to prepare for).''

THE TENNESSEE TITANS ARE ALIVE AND KICKING, BUT CORDIAL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The final seconds faded from the Adelphia Coliseum scoreboard
late Sunday afternoon, the gun sounded and players from the
Jacksonville Jaguars and the Tennessee Titans began performing what
has become a popular, colorful, National Football League post-game
ritual: seconds after seeking to sap each others' will and spirit,
opposing players were embracing each other near midfield,
exchanging pleasantries, back slapping, hand clapping, before
strolling to their locker rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Keenan McCardell, Jacksonville's fiery receiver, was not in a
gracious mood. The Jaguars had just been whipped, 41-14, by the
Titans.
</P>
<P>
   McCardell started toward the middle of the field and then spun
and sped toward the tunnel. He offered this to any passing
Tennessee Titan:
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see you again!'' he yelled. ``You gotta come to our
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, Tennessee has been there this season _ and won.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, while so many other NFL teams scramble for playoff spots
and stumble nearly each step of the way, the waltz between the
Jaguars and the Titans for supremacy in the American Football
Conference postseason is more glitzy, more glamorous.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville is a 13-2 team. Tennessee is 12-3.
</P>
<P>
   Both reside in the AFC Central division and both _ along with
the Indianapolis Colts (13-2) _ give the AFC three 12-plus victory
teams. The National Football Conference has only one team at 13-2:
the St. Louis Rams. Only one other NFC team owns 10 victories, the
Tampa Bay Buccaneers at 10-5.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Jacksonville, Tennessee and Indianapolis are each
alive for home-field advantage in the playoffs (St. Louis has
swiped that edge in the NFC) gives the AFC more luster. In the AFC,
three teams (Seattle, Kansas City and Miami) are fighting for the
two final playoff berths. Each team owns a 9-6 record.
</P>
<P>
   But in the NFC, the Giants, Dallas, Green Bay and Carolina toil
for the final, lone playoff berth, and each is a 7-8 team.
</P>
<P>
   The NFC, once by far the power conference, won 13 consecutive
Super Bowls before the Denver Broncos snapped the string by winning
the last two. But with the playoff picture in both conferences only
four days from taking final shape, the battle in each is now waged
in a glaringly different manner.
</P>
<P>
   In the AFC, the fight is with spears.
</P>
<P>
   In the NFC, it is with darts.
</P>
<P>
   That brings us back to Jacksonville and Tennessee, two teams
full of bark and bite. They are building a special rivalry. Either
can still win the AFC Central title.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville began its season with two victories, lost at home,
20-19, to Tennessee, and then won 11 straight games. The Jaguars
entered last week against Tennessee with a league-best 13-1 record
and were 2 points shy of a perfect season. They looked like a
confident team, an explosive one, especially on defense and in its
deep-strike passing game. They sought retribution against the
Titans but finished rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   The spiffy Jacksonville defense was torched for five touchdown
passes and 476 total yards. Quarterback Mark Brunell left with a
knee injury and will likely miss the home finale against the
Cincinnati Bengals. Brunell is expected back for the playoffs, but
the Jaguars will attempt to win the division and home-field
advantage on Sunday with a quarterback, Jay Fiedler, who will be
making his first NFL start.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville arrived in Memphis as late-season kings but left
with a tarnished crown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a wake-up call out there,'' McCardell said. ``It's not
going to be easy from here on out. In these big games, you gotta
play. They wanted it more than we did and you could see it. We know
what we gotta do, I don't care who it's against. And I'll bet we
see those guys again in the playoffs. I'm counting on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Titans hear that and chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh, I don't think they want to do that; they don't really want
to see us again,'' Yancey Thigpen, a Tennessee receiver, said.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee cornerback Anthony Dorsett said: ``I heard them coming
off the field. I heard stuff like `See you in a couple of weeks!'
I'm not trying to be boastful, but I'm not sure they want to see us
again, regardless of where it is.''
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the NFL's new and special rivalries, for sure.
Even Titans defensive end Jevon Kearse, a rookie from Florida, can
smell it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played in 15 NFL games now and the two against those guys
were not like the other ones,'' Kearse said. ``I don't know exactly
what it is, but its hot out there when we're both on the field. It
reminds me of my Florida-Florida State games.''
</P>
<P>
   In this season series, Tennessee is 2-0. Tennessee has the right
number.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure hope we have a hex on them,'' Eddie George, the Titans
running back, said. ``You get a team and you beat them like that
and you try and put doubt in their minds. If they've lost only two
games and both are to us, and especially by this last score, that's
something hard to forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Titans safety Blaine Bishop said: ``We made a statement. And
both teams know what that statement is.''
</P>
<P>
   With a chance to improve their playoff lot, Dallas, Detroit, the
Giants, Arizona, Carolina, Kansas City, Green Bay and Miami all
lost their second-to-last regular season game. These are the
questions they asked: 1) Were we unprepared? 2) Were we outcoached?
3) Are we not good enough? 4) Did we choke?
</P>
<P>
   For Jacksonville, long ago playoff bound, the question is
different: Can we beat Tennessee?

   The Cupertino company released the update after a professor at
Georgia Tech issued a public warning about a flaw in Mac OS 9, the
latest release of Apple's operating system software.
</P>
<P>
   According to John A. Copeland, director of the school's
Communications Systems Center, hackers could take advantage of the
defect to overwhelm other Internet-connected machines with floods
of unwanted data.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe an international group is building up the
infrastructure for a New Year's Eve attack that will paralyze large
segments of the Internet,'' Copeland wrote on a ``Frequently Asked
Questions'' page on his personal Web site. ``Web sites that people
will try to access for Y2K information are prime candidates, as are
news services such as CNN.com.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple's fix, in the form of a ``system extension'' called OT
Tuner 1.0, is available at  &LR; http:/ asu.info. &LR; 
 &LR; apple.com/swupdates.nsf /artnum/ &LR;   &LR; n11559.cq  &LR; If users have turned
on an optional ``auto-update'' feature in Mac OS 9, the file will
be downloaded and installed automatically, according to an Apple
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Copeland noted, however, that many Mac users don't turn on that
feature, and even if they do, it might not check for updates for
days or weeks, depending upon the user's settings.
</P>
<P>
   He urged Mac OS 9 users with high-speed, ``always-on'' Internet
connections _ via a corporate network, a cable modem or a digital
subscriber line (DSL) telephone connection _ to download and
install the update immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Copeland said he first discovered the problem about a month ago
as part of a study at his center on the ``probes'' hackers send
over the Internet to locate vulnerable computers. He noticed some
unusual 29-byte data packets that were reaching his Macintosh and
causing it to send a 1500-byte packet back to the source of the
probe.
</P>
<P>
   Because only computers with Mac OS 9 respond to this probe,
hackers could collect a list of such machines. Later, they could
resend  &LR; send a series of probes to the machines on the list, but
this time duping the Macs into responding not to the actual source,
but instead to a computer the hacker wishes to attack.
</P>
<P>
   By getting 40 or more Mac OS 9 computers to respond
simultaneously to the same target machine, the hackers could flood
it with so much incoming traffic that it would be unable to perform
its normal chores. Such exploits are known as ``denial-of-service
attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last month, Copeland said, he has detected the
suspicious packets on five occasions. One probe apparently
originated in Italy and another at Duke University, while the
others came from the Persian Gulf area, according to Copeland. One
of the probes from the Gulf area was routed through South Africa,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview he acknowledged that a New Year's Eve
attack scenario is only ``surmise,'' but urged users to take the
risk seriously. He suggested that all users with high-speed
Internet connections _ not just Macs, but also PCs and Unix
machines _ consider disconnecting them over the upcoming holiday
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In response to Copeland's warning, the CERT Coordination Center
at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh _ a federally funded
organization, formerly known as the ``computer emergency response
team,'' that warns about computer-security risks _ yesterday issued
an advisory about the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Copeland said he notified Apple about the problem on December
22, and by December 24 engineers there had come up with a test
version of a fix, but it was not made available to the public until
after Copeland issued his warning yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we believe the potential risk to our customers is
extremely small,'' Apple said in a statement read by spokesman Matt
Hutchison, ``we have worked quickly to provide the latest and most
secure software to Mac users.''

REPUBLICANS IN ILLINOIS FEUD OVER GUN CONTROL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo.)  (rk) 
 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Ill. _ It was a technicality that the Illinois
Supreme Court cited in striking down a tough gun law earlier this
month. But it has been a sharp-elbowed political feud among
Republicans that has kept the measure from being restored.
</P>
<P>
   As Republican leaders squabble, meanwhile, some prosecutors in
Illinois have been forced to dismiss charges against defendants
accused of the illegal use of firearms.
</P>
<P>
   To mend the breach in the gun law, Gov. George Ryan, a moderate
Republican who favors tight gun controls, has called a special
session of the state Senate on Wednesday. The senators will
consider restoring a provision of the old law that made carrying a
concealed weapon a felony. The Senate rejected that provision two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the fight against the bill then was another powerful
Republican, James Philip, the Senate president. Philip, a
conservative who represents a suburban Chicago district, believes
that carrying a concealed weapon should merit only a misdemeanor
charge. The governor insists that the violation remain a felony. A
felony conviction would carry a prison term of up to three years,
while a misdemeanor conviction would carry a maximum sentence of a
year in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Fuming, Ryan has accused his Republican foes of pursuing a
back-door measure to legalize the carrying of concealed weapons so
that, as he put it, ``everybody in the country can walk around with
a .45 stuck in their belt under their coat.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Philip, a former Marine and hunter known as Pate,
has contended that he simply wants to protect sportsmen from being
prosecuted. He has also characterized Ryan as a hypocrite, noting
that the governor is supporting the presidential candidacy of Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas, who signed a bill that allows Texans to
carry concealed weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The gun measure favored by Ryan won passage in the state's House
of Representatives, where Democrats hold a majority. But
Republicans hold strong control of the Senate, and Ryan is exerting
pressure on several of them to change their votes, or bear the onus
of taking a position generally considered unpopular in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   As Senate president, Philip has considerable power. He hands out
committee assignments, decides what bills are called to the floor
and directs hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign
contributions to Republican politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians in Chicago say the feud is only partly about guns.
Conservatives in the state have complained that Ryan has acted less
like a Republican than a Democrat, and a liberal one at that.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan has infuriated conservatives on several issues. He raised
taxes on alcohol and increased fees on driver's license
applications. He has spoken out for gay rights. He has cultivated
an amiable relationship with Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago, , a
Democrat, and favored huge spending bills for projects in that
city. And he recently traveled to Cuba and met with Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has also come under criticism for a bribery scandal
in driver's license bureaus while he was secretary of state; the
secretary's office oversees the bureaus.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives in the Legislature have scarcely tried to conceal
their displeasure with Ryan. Sen. Kirk W. Dillard, a Republican
from suburban Chicago, told his Senate colleagues last week that
they did not need to show fealty to the governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a separate and equal and independent branch of
government,'' Dillard said.
</P>
<P>
   The State Supreme Court struck down the 1994 crime law, known as
the Safe Neighborhoods Act, because it lumped some unrelated
measures in a single bill _ a violation, the court said, of the
state's constitutional requirement that laws address a single
subject.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois has never been considered a stronghold of the National
Rifle Association or other gun rights activists. The state's
electoral power is concentrated in the Chicago region, where people
tend to favor stronger gun controls than in the more rural central
and southern regions.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Tribune published an editorial last week that
sharply criticized suburban Republicans who have joined Philip in
favoring a lesser charge for carrying a concealed weapon. It
asserted that these Republicans had ``decided to ignore the will of
the majority'' in the Chicago area, ``a majority that has said
repeatedly in opinion polls that it wants to rid our streets and
sidewalks of deadly handguns.''
</P>
<P>
   Daley and some 25 suburban mayors have spoken in support of the
stricter gun laws. Terry Hillard, the superintendent of police in
Chicago, delivered an impassioned plea to lawmakers in Springfield
last week to restore the tough gun law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm begging that this assembly, the senators and the House of
Representatives will put this law back into effect without changing
one iota, one period,'' Hillard said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Richard Devine, a Democrat who is the state's attorney for Cook
County, released a study showing that gang members were involved in
70 percent of the 1,800 illegal-weapons cases in Cook County in the
first six months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   And the state's director of natural resources, Brent Manning,
traveled around the state on Monday to campaign for the stricter
gun bill, saying that no hunter had been charged with a felony for
unlawful use of a firearm since the Safe Neighborhoods Act took
effect in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   While the debate in Springfield has largely hewed to party
lines, some rural Democrats have favored the lower gun penalties,
and some urban Republicans have supported the stricter law.
</P>
<P>
   With the gun bill in limbo, prosecutors in some Illinois
counties have referred cases to the U.S. attorney's office, so that
suspects can be charged under federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Some 30 states allow people who meet certain objective criteria,
like age and background checks, to carry a concealed weapon. A
dozen or so other states allow public officials, usually the
sheriff, to issue permits to people who show a need to carry a
concealed weapon. Such people might include workers who transport
large amounts of cash, for example.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare statewide vote on the issue earlier this year,
Missourians soundly defeated a measure that would have allowed
people to carry concealed weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan has said that his stance on gun control was a major factor
in his campaign for governor last year against Glenn Poshard, a
conservative Democrat who had voted against some gun control
measures as a congressman representing central Illinois.

ON FRENCH SOIL, A HARVEST OF HIP-HOP HYBRIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Jan. 2)  
 Amy Serafin is the editor of Where magazine in Paris.  
 (bl)  
 By AMY SERAFIN    c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ One day last spring, Kader Belarbi found himself rolling
around on the floor, clinging to a stick and a chunk of concrete.
It was an unusual position for a star of the Paris Opera Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   The pose resulted from a project sponsored by the French
Author's Guild in which an exceptional dancer chooses a
choreographer with whom to create an original work. Belarbi
selected the hip-hop choreographer Farid Berki, and together they
were struggling to find a place where classical and urban dance
could meet.
</P>
<P>
   In France, hip-hop dance has transcended the street, moved into
the theaters, melded with other forms. Now it had pushed the
normally airborne Belarbi to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for an energy that had nothing to do with
classical or contemporary dance, something brute,'' said Belarbi.
``I wanted to be in unknown territory, to put myself in danger.
Farid's choreography has many ingredients; he's a hip-hop
dissident.''
</P>
<P>
   Berki, 36, is one of the most creative forces in an increasingly
inventive movement. Born in the housing projects of Tourcoing, a
northern French city, he comes from what he describes as a
``typical hip-hop background'' in France: French mother, Algerian
father, a high school dropout with limited career possibilities
whose life changed when he discovered American break dancing on
television in the early 1980s. He taught himself to break, pop and
lock, then studied other dance styles, from African dance to Alvin
Ailey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider myself a hip-hop choreographer but reserve the
right to go into the fringe,'' he says. ``I work with mixtures,
because that's part of my culture.'' Berki has hip-hopped to
everything from flamenco to Stravinsky's ``Petrouchka.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pas de Vague Avant l'Eclipse'' (``No Waves Before the
Eclipse''), his collaboration with Belarbi, is set to a minimalist
score. Slow, strange, uncategorizable, it was first shown in
Avignon last summer, and a reworked version will take the stage at
the Suresnes Cites Danse festival in a suburb 10 miles west of
Paris, from Jan. 14 through Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   These days in France, hip-hop dance is all over the map. The
group Aktuel Force sets its latest creation in Egypt, complete with
a Cleopatra figure, a rare female performer in a male-dominated
world. The Compagnie Kafig uses Arab-Andalusian music and violins
as props to symbolize the gulf between classical music and the
street. Other dancers are experimenting with hip-hop and tap.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of their American counterparts, most French hip-hop
dancers are members of minorities; unlike the Americans, however,
the French dancers are predominantly first- or second-generation
immigrants, mainly from North Africa, who have grown up in the
poorer suburbs, France's equivalent of the inner city. On a recent
evening in a theater near Paris, a company named Accrorap presented
its ``Priere Pour un Fou'' (``Prayer for a Crazy Man''), a creation
inspired by the members' Algerian roots.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional elements of the North African Gnawa culture, like
bending from the waist in prayer, mix with classic hip-hop moves.
The dancers hold their hands to their faces in the same gesture
that Algerian women use to show anguish, as they have after
massacres by the country's religious extremists. One of the
strongest images is that of a dancer carrying another sideways,
balanced on his shoulders and curled across his face. Blinded and
suffocated by what the choreographer, Kader Attou, calls ``death
always in front of us,'' the dancer continues to advance, in slow,
wavering steps.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd for this performance ranged from middle-class,
middle-aged theatergoers to excited bands of teen-agers _ not an
uncommon mixture for a French hip-hop show since the early 90's,
when street dancers came to the attention of a handful of theater
directors. As doors began to open and the dancers found themselves
subsidized and onstage, hip-hop evolved from demonstrations of
physical prowess to longer pieces with story lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of any other country that supports dance more
than France,'' says Guy Darmet, director of the Maison de la Danse
in Lyon, a major player in the development of the French movement.
The theater's support has enabled Attou to plan a trip to India
this spring to work on a hybrid of hip-hop and Kathakali dance.
</P>
<P>
   Mourad Merzouki, the artistic director of Compagnie Kafig,
formed his very successful troupe with a grant from the Lyon
theater. Last autumn the company performed in the cradle of
hip-hop, the Bronx, as part of the New Europe '99 Festival.
Merzouki remarks that ``American dancers are still very attached to
rap culture, television and money.
</P>
<P>
   ``In France we have a dialogue with theaters and contemporary
dance companies that gives us an outlook on different types of
music and movement,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The Suresnes Cites Danse festival has brought together
contemporary choreographers and hip-hop dancers since it was
created in 1993. ``I didn't want to just present street dance; I
wanted to organize exchanges, confrontations between different
universes,'' explains the festival's director, Olivier Meyer. From
the contemporary dance scene he has invited choreographers like the
American postmodernist Doug Elkins; Blanca Li, an unconventional
Spanish dancer based in Paris, and Jose Montalvo, whose
``Paradis,'' a piece he created in Lyon with dancers he met in
Suresnes, has made him an international sensation. It was also
performed as part of the New Europe festival.
</P>
<P>
   Although French hip-hoppers are evolving artistically, a
movement from the streets is bound to lose some of its edge the day
it accepts subsidies. As Berki points out: ``In the United States,
dancers who were our models have now chosen to make a lot of money
with videos. Instead of advancing, they are doing the same things.
But for us, theaters can be golden prisons. When someone pays you
to perform, you have to watch what you do.''

LOUIS FERAUD, PROMINENT FASHION DESIGNER, DIES AT 79 IN PARIS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Louis Feraud, a prominent French fashion designer who
first made his name in the mid-1950s when Brigitte Bardot began
wearing his brightly colored summer dresses, died on Tuesday at his
home in Paris. He was 79. French news reports said he had been
suffering from Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   During a career that lasted more than 40 years, Feraud created
not only haute couture and ready-to-wear designs for women but
menswear, perfumes and scarves. With Kim Novak and Ingrid Bergman
among his early clients, he was considered a classical French
designer in the tradition of Christian Dior, Balenciaga and
Givenchy, but his clothes also reflected the cheerful colors of his
native Provence.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I always wanted to do was to please women,'' he once
said. His company's best known advertising line said just that:
``Louis Feraud loves women.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, his health already failing, Feraud handed over control
of the fashion house to his daughter, Dominique, also a designer,
whose own clothes were noticeably more elaborate. In 1997, Ms.
Feraud, widely known as Kiki, sold the Louis Feraud ready-to-wear
label to the Dutch textile group Secon, which acquired the rest of
the company three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Arles on Feb. 13, 1920, Feraud's first love was
painting, which prompted him to turn away from his father's bakery
business. During Germany's wartime occupation of France, he joined
the Resistance in Marseille and, although arrested once, he escaped
and participated in the liberation of France in 1944. Working in
Paris as a swim teacher after the war, he met his future wife,
Alice, and they moved to Cannes where he planned to paint.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife, better known as Zizi, opened a small boutique
in the late 1940s and it was there that Ms. Bardot appeared during
the 1955 Cannes film festival to buy a white dress. ``Photographers
and journalists followed her,'' Feraud recalled years later.
``Within a week, every woman up and down the Cote d'Azur was
wearing my little white dress. We sold 500 of them in a matter of
days.''
</P>
<P>
   This stroke of luck brought Feraud instant fame, and he was soon
designing clothes for Ms. Bardot's screen roles. Moving to Paris in
1956, he opened a store and workshop on the fashionable Rue du
Fabourg St.-Honore opposite the Elysee Palace, the residence of
French presidents. Two years later, already popular with the
international jet set, he was invited to present his designs along
with France's top couturiers.
</P>
<P>
   From the 1960s, Feraud gained fame abroad, with his high-quality
ready-to-wear clothes sold in such stores as Saks Fifth Avenue in
New York and Harrod's in London and his haute couture designs
present on runways in the United States, Japan, Britain, Italy and
Brazil. In the 70s, he expanded into menswear and launched a new
line of perfumes, among them ``Justine'' for women and ``Corrida''
for men. Stylists who worked for him early in their careers
included Daniel Hechter and Jean-Louis Scherrer.
</P>
<P>
   Even at the height of his career, Feraud never abandoned his
lifelong passion for painting, and he was particularly pleased when
a selection of his works was shown at the Grand Palais in Paris in
1988. He also wrote a novel, ``L'Ete du Pingouin,'' or ``The
Penguin's Summer,'' and a memoir, ``L'Hiver des Fous,'' or ``The
Winter of Fools.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, Feraud divorced Zizi Feraud and was briefly
married to Mia Fonssagrives, but Zizi always remained his business
partner and close friend. After Feraud retired in 1995, Zizi and
Kiki, who both survive him, continued to run the company until it
was sold.

 &HT;    Tech, Hamilton ponder next step
 &HT;    By J.C. Clemons
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ He has set eight ACC records and 18 Georgia
Tech records.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Joe Hamilton, who plays his final game as the Yellow
Jackets quarterback Saturday against Miami in the Gator Bowl, says
the best might be yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got something I'm going to pull out of my hat for the
last game,'' Hamilton said Tuesday. ``I'm not going to lull anybody
to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Fat chance of that happening.
</P>
<P>
   A master at avoiding disaster, Hamilton has led Tech to seven
fourth-quarter, game-saving drives in the past 18 contests. With
Hamilton having started all but one of the 44 games in his career,
the mere thought of not having him around The Flats is unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   And well it should.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the state of Georgia will see a player like him
at that position for a while,'' coach George O'Leary said. ``He's
done nothing but great things for Georgia Tech, the ACC and the
city of Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton has done even more than that for his teammates, who
have helped the program evolve from the 1-10 disaster in 1994 to a
No. 9 ranking by '98 and third bowl appearance in a row this
season.
</P>
<P>
   It's something Tech had not done in 27 years.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton has not been a one-man gang. Undoubtedly, however, the
diminutive game-breaker from tiny Alvin, S.C., has given a huge
lift to Georgia Tech's profile in college football.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe's just a guy who you know you can trust in and believe in
and know he will get it done,'' said offensive tackle Jon Carman,
who also will wear the old-gold-and-blue for a final time.
</P>
<P>
   Phillip Rogers, who arrived with Hamilton at Tech in O'Leary's
first recruiting class, said he has admired the way Hamilton has
developed, including off of the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just turned the program around,'' Rogers said. ``I've
grown up with him, seen how hard he works every day, so I'm not
surprised at all that Joe's accomplished. But if I were able to
step back and watch him, I'd be amazed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we needed him to step up in a big game, he's
performed. And the way he's handled himself in the media without
ever getting the bighead _ he's always been Joe.''
</P>
<P>
   Next season, though, he won't be Georgia Tech's Joe, and someone
out of the group of George Godsey, Brian Camp and Andy Hall will
emerge as his successor.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever he lands, Hamilton insists he will be lining up under
center, playing the only position he's ever played.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton can make all the throws _ deep outs, slants and bombs _
demanded of a pro quarterback, and he reads defenses as well as
anyone. But Hamilton's future is in doubt because at 5 feet 10, he
is considered four to five inches short of what the pros deem as
optimum to achieve on the next level.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be wise to count Hamilton out, O'Leary says. The
quarterback has the ability to find passing lanes, with only a few
passes tipped at the line of scrimmage this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't bet against him; he's such a great competitor,''
said O'Leary, a former NFL assistant. ``The first thing at that
level is arm strength. The second thing is vision _ all great
quarterbacks see the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though players of similar stature, including the Bills'
Doug Flutie and Shaun King of the Buccaneers, are doing well as NFL
quarterbacks, Hamilton is in limbo about his future.
</P>
<P>
   He has not been invited to next month's NFL combine, where
near-certain top-round draft picks get a chance to display their
skills. For now, the Senior Bowl, the all-star game that attracts
more NFL coaches, general managers and scouts than any other, might
be Hamilton's final national stage upon which to impress.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I want is a chance to play quarterback,'' Hamilton said.
``If I get that chance, and I can't do it... But if I don't get a
chance, and they say I can't do it because of my height, then I'm
going to be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the NFL wouldn't let me play quarterback, then the Canadian
League is definitely a consideration.''

DESPITE PROBLEMS, DAIMLERCHRYSLER REPORTS REVENUE INCREASE
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Mich.)   (jw) 
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ After a stormy first year _ one that included
management turmoil, a strategy change and employee culture shock _
DaimlerChrysler said Tuesday that preliminary figures showed 1999
revenue increased 12.3 percent and operating profits rose even
more.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler, which was formed on Nov. 12, 1998, when
Germany's staid Daimler-Benz bought Chrysler, said its 1999 revenue
would probably reach 148 billion euros, or $149 billion, up 12.3
percent from the 131.8 billion euros, or $154.6 billion, the two
companies earned in 1998. For 1998, the revenue figures were
calculated using the Dec. 31, 1998, exchange rate of 1.1733 dollars
a euro, while the 1999 figures reflect the euro's fall to roughly
1.01 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   ``The preliminary figures also indicate that DaimlerChrysler's
operating profits will have grown more strongly than revenues,''
the company said in a statement. DaimlerChrysler is scheduled to
announce its fourth-quarter results on Feb. 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customers are rewarding us for our innovative products,
the leading design of our vehicles and our comprehensive
services,'' said Juergen Schrempp, DaimlerChrysler's co-chairman.
``We are well prepared for the year 2000 and the years ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Auto analysts said the company's profits looked healthy despite
the culture clashes that accompanied the merger. ``Financially, you
can't complain _ it looks like a strong fourth quarter,'' said
David Healy, an analyst at Burnham Securities. ``Culturally, that
may be something else again.''
</P>
<P>
   Many mergers have rocky beginnings, and DaimlerChrysler has been
no exception. Chrysler had a number of charms for Daimler: the
combined product lineup allowed the merged company to sell
everything from cheap cars like the Dodge Neon to rough-and-tumble
Jeeps to leather-laden Mercedes sedans in markets around the world.
Stuffy Daimler also wanted to capture Chrysler's fast-moving
managerial habits, which had brought to life the hot car and truck
designs that turned the company around in the 1990s. And executives
said they could wring cost savings from the conglomerate by
combining operations that customers would not notice.
</P>
<P>
   But in this marriage, Americans grumble that their German spouse
began demanding changes after the wedding.
</P>
<P>
   While executives had always planned to keep separate the various
brands _ Mercedes, Chrysler and the late Plymouth _ they had
planned to have engineers work closely behind the scenes,
transferring expertise between Detroit and Stuttgart.
</P>
<P>
   But in late October, DaimlerChrysler announced a change: It
would return to semiautonomous operations, with the former Chrysler
and the former Mercedes units' being run more like separate
businesses under a holding company.
</P>
<P>
   The move was partly intended to shore up flagging morale in
Detroit. Some top managers of the former Chrysler are now gone:
Robert Lutz, the charismatic car guy, is now the chairman and chief
executive of Exide, the battery maker. The manufacturing whiz
Dennis Pawley and the engineering wizard Francois Castaing are now
auto industry consultants. The well-liked Thomas Stallkamp, a
DaimlerChrysler vice chairman, was unceremoniously ousted this fall
and will become chief executive of MSX International, an industry
engineering and technology consulting company. The co-chairman,
Robert Eaton, having said when the merger was announced that he
would retire within three years, has played second fiddle to
Schrempp.
</P>
<P>
   So the team that led Chrysler has shrunk. James Holden, the
former Chrysler marketing chief, is now president of
DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler unit, and Thomas Gale is the unit's
executive vice president. Holden acknowledged the turmoil at a
lunch with reporters last month, saying, ``There has been some
erosion in morale at the same time we've been turning in record
sales and profits.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the dust kicked up by the merger was now clearing.
``There's no real discussion any more of who stands for what, who
married up or who married down,'' Holden said. ``I don't see morale
as at a critical level.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, given that DaimlerChrysler's stock started at $77.75,
rose to $108 in January, then plunged to a low of $66.25 earlier
this month and has since come back to close at $74.6875 Tuesday,
analysts have questioned whether the merger was worth it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The jury is still out on that,'' Healy of Burnham Securities
said.
</P>
<P>
   Others agreed. ``That's debatable,'' said Rod Lache, an analyst
at Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown. ``It looks to me like at least in the
first year, investors probably would have done better owning each
company.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock is more or less telling of investors' disappointment
that they didn't do better, largely because a lot of the postmerger
synergies and cost savings appear to have been lost before they
dropped to the bottom line,'' Lache said.

   A Record for Dow Jones; Nasdaq Falls Shy of 4,000
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average climbed to a record. Led by
Alcoa, United Technologies and Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing,
the Dow closed at 11,476.71, up 85.63 points, or 0.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   High-flying technology shares suffered a late-day sell-off, and
the Nasdaq composite index _ which traded above the 4,000 level for
most of the session _ gave up a 47-point gain and closed lower. The
Nasdaq fell 3.27 points, to 3,972.11. Meanwhile, the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index barely budged, edging up 0.56 point, to
1,457.66.

   Internet Propels Stocks in Asia
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices in Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Malaysia rose
again, riding a wave of euphoria over the Internet, providing fresh

   Tama Starr, the third generation of her family to run Artkraft
Strauss, the company known for its giant animated signs in Times
Square and the New Year's Eve ball that it has tended and lowered

in liberal arts. After a year of graduate study in comparative
religion, she moved to Hawaii, built a house, was a writer and was
in a performing arts group. But she returned to the company, where
she has spent 18 New Year's Eves atop the tower where the ball

   D'Artagnan, a New Jersey company, is voluntarily recalling 26 of

of possible contamination with a sometimes deadly bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Commodity Rally Not a Warning Sign
</P>
<P>
   As the prices of commodities like heating oil, crude oil, copper
and nickel make a run at the end of the year, some analysts say
that the rally is built on a bet that the global economy, led by
Asia and Europe, will continue to rebound in 2000. But the rise in
industrial commodities is not, as it has been in the past, an early
warning signal for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer Confidence Stays Strong
</P>
<P>
   Consumer confidence rose in December to the highest level in
three decades. The Conference Board said its index of consumer
confidence rose to 141.4 this month, the second-highest reading in
the 32 years. In a separate report, the National Association of
Realtors said that sales of existing homes surged 6 percent in
November, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.09 million

   Last year, Congress heard testimony from women who said that
years after their husbands left, they discovered that they had been
cheating on their taxes and that the IRS expected the women to pay

GROWTH REMOVED FROM TIPPER GORE'S THYROID GLAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (Subs to add more details about the surgery.) (DW) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Tipper Gore, the wife of Vice President Al Gore,
underwent surgery Tuesday to remove a growth from her thyroid
gland, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
   Camille Johnston, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Gore, said doctors at
Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore removed the growth from the
right side of the thyroid during an operation that lasted two hours
and five minutes. The growth, which Ms. Johnston described as a
nodule, will be tested to determine whether it is cancerous.
Thyroid nodules are a common medical problem.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors found the growth on Mrs. Gore's thyroid when she sought
treatment for a chronic pain in her neck that stemmed from an
``exercise-related'' injury, Ms. Johnston said. When noninvasive
tests did not yield a definitive diagnosis, the doctors decided on
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earlier diagnostic studies, including a fine-needle
aspiration, were performed and were inconclusive,'' said Dr. Robert
Udelsman, the chief of the division of surgical oncology and
endocrine surgery at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and the
doctor who performed the operation. ``Today's surgery was performed
without complication, and Mrs. Gore is resting comfortably.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president accompanied his wife to the hospital. Mrs.
Gore is expected to be discharged on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Johnston said Mrs. Gore was not suffering symptoms from any
disease of the thyroid like Graves' disease or goiter.
</P>
<P>
   Thyroid tumors account for more than 90 percent of all endocrine
cancers and result in close to 60 percent of the deaths from
cancers that attack the endocrine system. The incidence of thyroid
cancer is 5.8 per 100,000 for females and 2.4 per 100,000 for
males.

THE BUSH CAMPAIGN: AT A GLANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Pa., Mich., Mont.)  (With BUSH-CAMPAIGN) 
(nk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEADQUARTERS: Austin, Texas
</P>
<P>
   STAFF SIZE: 185 full-time paid workers.
</P>
<P>
   TOP CAMPAIGN STAFF: At the head of George W. Bush's campaign is
a troika of longtime aides: the campaign manager, Joe Allbaugh, who
has never guided a national effort; the chief strategist, Karl
Rove, a veteran Republican operative; and the communications
director, Karen P. Hughes, who has been Bush's spokeswoman since
his successful race for Texas governor in 1994. The top media
strategist is Mark McKinnon, a former Democratic operative who
joined Bush for his 1998 re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   CASH ON HAND: Bush's aides would not release a figure, but the
campaign's estimated fund-raising of more than $65 million and its
spending through September suggest that he still has tens of
millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   PROMINENT ADVISERS: Chief foreign policy adviser is Condoleezza
Rice, a former provost of Stanford University who was a Russia
specialist on the National Security Council under Bush's father.
Chief domestic policy adviser is former Mayor Stephen Goldsmith of
Indianapolis. Chief economic adviser is Lawrence B. Lindsey, a
Harvard-trained, supply-side economist who worked under Presidents
George Bush and Ronald Reagan. Bush is also close to several other
Republican governors, particularly Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, John
Engler of Michigan and Marc Racicot of Montana.
</P>
<P>
   BEST MOVES SO FAR: By raising so much money and lining up so
many Republican endorsements early in the year, Bush established
himself as the most formidable candidate in the field. And with his
catch phrase of ``compassionate conservatism,'' he signaled to
Republicans that he was ready to compete with any Democratic
nominee for the political center.
</P>
<P>
   WORST MOVES SO FAR: Bush's absence from two early Republican
candidate forums in New Hampshire led to complaints that he was an
aloof front-runner, and his limited investment of time in the state
may have helped Sen. John McCain pull ahead there. Bush's flubbing
of a televised pop quiz on lesser-known international figures gave
rise to questions about his preparedness for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   CHALLENGES AHEAD: Bush must try to deny McCain any kind of
resounding victory in New Hampshire. And he needs to convince
voters that he can think on his feet and speak without resorting to
slogans and canned remarks.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Stock markets across Asia are riding out the
millennium on a cloud of euphoria generated by _ what else? _ the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Tokyo, Seoul, Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur rose again
Tuesday, providing fresh evidence, if any were needed, that the
information revolution has replaced the Asian economic crisis as
the preoccupation of investors in this part of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asia has lagged the West in information technology,'' said
Dong Tao, a regional economist with Credit Suisse First Boston in
Hong Kong. ``But with Asia recovering from the crisis, companies
are now willing to invest in this area. People see the possibility
of a real breakthrough.''
</P>
<P>
   In South Korea, the market rose 2.2 percent to a five-year high,
while stocks in Taiwan were up four-tenths of 1 percent, in the
last trading sessions of 1999 for those markets. The gains capped a
rally that began early in the year, as fears about Asian finances
receded. After a setback during the summer, the rally reignited in
October as companies began pursuing a flurry of Internet-related
ventures in the region.
</P>
<P>
   This jolt of excitement helped the benchmark South Korean index
gain 82.78 percent for the year _ and more yet in dollar terms,
92.58 percent _ the best performances of any Asian market outside
Japan. Taiwan's exchange, despite being buffeted by a devastating
earthquake in September, rose 31.63 percent from its final trading
session of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere has the giddiness over technology been more pronounced
than in Hong Kong. The benchmark Hang Seng index has moved from
strength to strength over the last week, up more than half a
percent Tuesday, to 16,928.29. It has risen 68 percent so far this
year, and is higher now than it was at the peak of the territory's
real estate boom in the mid-'90s.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Tuesday's gain was led by a company that did not
exist a year ago: Pacific Century Cyberworks, which invests in
Internet start-ups and is creating its own satellite-delivered
Internet service. Its shares jumped 22 percent Tuesday, after
soaring 44 percent last Thursday and Friday. The surge began in the
United States last Wednesday, when the company's shares doubled in
over-the-counter trading.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Century Cyberworks _ which was founded by Richard Li,
the son of the Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing _ loses money and will
for several more years. Still, the company is being hailed as the
vehicle that could turn Hong Kong into a technology mecca. And the
younger Li spent last week denying rumors that he was about to swap
shares with Microsoft or seek a listing on the Nasdaq market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pacific Century does not even have a core business yet,'' Tao
of Credit Suisse First Boston said. ``But it has demonstrated its
ability to raise funds, and that's what's important in this
business.''
</P>
<P>
   With a market capitalization exceeding $30 billion, Pacific
Century is worth almost as much as the elder Li's flagship company,
Cheung Kong Holdings. Tao suggested that Richard Li had created as
much wealth, on paper, in five months as his father did in 50
years.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's Internet bubble has expanded to encompass
Internet-related companies like Cable and Wireless HKT, Hong Kong's
local phone provider, and China Telecom (Hong Kong), the publicly
listed arm of the entrenched mainland Chinese phone company.
</P>
<P>
   China Telecom, which owns the gateways that Chinese use to gain
access to the World Wide Web, is regarded by investors as a way to
capitalize on the rapid growth of the Internet there. Cable and
Wireless HKT recently signed a deal with Star TV, an Asian
satellite television company controlled by the News Corp., to
provide high-speed Internet access and television programs
throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the resurgence of Asian stocks, many analysts do not
think that Hong Kong and other Asian markets are as steeply priced
as those in the United States. Brokerage firms here predict that
the Hang Seng index will finish next year significantly above its
current levels, even with 1999's ascent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hong Kong market could easily pull back a bit from here,''
acknowledged Richard Margolis, a regional strategist at Merrill
Lynch here. ``But it's not as heavily underpinned as the U.S.
markets by companies whose only valuation is a multiple of their
losses.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the optimism is that Asia's underlying economies
have recovered faster than almost anyone predicted. Tao, for
example, recently increased his forecast for Hong Kong's economic
growth in 2000 to 5.1 percent, from 3.2 percent. He says the
territory is enjoying a sharp, ``V-shaped'' rebound.
</P>
<P>
   With exports from South Korea booming and foreign investors
pouring money into stocks there, the Korea Institute for Industrial
Economics and Trade estimated that the country's gross domestic
product will increase this year at an outsized rate of 9.5 percent,
and a very respectable 6.5 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts are wary of projecting a future of unbroken
gains. The enthusiasm for Internet shares is an export of the
United States, and it has made Asian markets more dependent than
ever on stock performance in New York, especially on the Nasdaq in
recent months. If either the Nasdaq or the Dow Jones industrial
average were to fall significantly from their current levels,
analysts said it could halt the rebound in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Simon L. Ogus, former head of Asian economics at Warburg Dillon
Read, said: ``There has always been a lot of correlation between
the U.S. and Asian markets, because many of them are small, trading
economies. But there is more correlation than ever now. We've got
one huge correlative bet going on here.''

GOLDMAN, SACHS ACQUIRING 18% OF ARGENTINE MEDIA GIANT
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ In one of Latin America's largest private
equity investments, Goldman, Sachs agreed Tuesday to acquire a
stake in Grupo Clarin of Argentina, the publisher of the
largest-circulation newspaper in the Spanish-speaking world, for
$500 million.
</P>
<P>
   Clarin's varied interests, which had been informally allied,
will be grouped under a holding company formed to make the
completion of the deal easier.
</P>
<P>
   Through its merchant banking group, Goldman bought close to 18
percent of that holding company, which has extensive pay TV, radio,
telecommunications, news agency and Internet operations in addition
to its flagship Buenos Aires daily newspaper, also called Clarin.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction is seen as speeding the modernization and
consolidation of the media and telecommunications industries in
Argentina, one of Latin America's more prosperous nations over the
last several years.
</P>
<P>
   With the injection of capital from Goldman, Clarin will be
better positioned to compete with rivals that have received similar
investments. The deal could also help Clarin proceed with expansion
plans that may include a public offering of stock outside
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clarin has one of the best collections of media assets
anywhere in the world,'' said Muneer Satter, a managing director in
Goldman's merchant banking group.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will put the investment bank on similar footing with
such other U.S. companies as Citigroup and Hicks, Muse, Tate &AMP;
Furst, the Texas-based private equity firm, which have made
significant forays into Argentine media businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The scope of the alliance between Goldman, Sachs and Clarin is
second only to the $700 million acquisition last year of CEI
Citicorp, a rival media group with a wide range of holdings, by
Hicks, Muse and an Argentine partner.
</P>
<P>
   Such firms are seeking to capitalize on Argentines' relatively
high cable television use. Groups like Clarin that have holdings in
areas like telecommunications and the Internet, in addition to
their pay TV operations, are attractive investment candidates
because they provide opportunities for combining technologies to
reach customers online.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina is also one of the most open countries in Latin
America in terms of allowing foreign investment in its media
companies.

   The Cowboys are oh-for-two in their past two games against teams

facing a third ``spoiler'' in as many weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants need, in order to keep their playoff hopes alive, for
underdog Arizona to win at Green Bay earlier in the day. (The
Cardinals-Packers game will be winding down about the same time
that the Giants-Cowboys game is set to begin at 3 p.m.)
</P>
<P>
   The 7-8 Cowboys control their playoff] destiny. If they win,
they're in.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-8 Giants on the other hand, need help. If Green Bay beats
Arizona at Lambeau Field, the Giants are eliminated before they can
even step on the field and run a play at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us to spend a lot of time thinking about \Rthe Giants'
playoff situation\S would be wasted energy,'' Cowboys owner Jerry
Jones said yesterday. ``Either way ... this \Rgame\S is about us
finding a way to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones held an unprecedented, 20-minute, closed-door meeting with
about 20 veteran players on Monday. He spoke. They listened. Jones
challenged them to step up like never before in carrying out their
leadership roles and to prepare like never before in finding a way
to win Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Did he consider the meeting a success?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think about it that way,'' Jones said. ``It was our
business ... I thought it was appropriate, and that's all I want to
say about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Chan Gailey also doesn't have a preference as to whether
the Giants are eliminated or alive when Sunday's late-afternoon
kickoff rolls around. He takes the position that he has enough to
concern himself with the Cowboys than to start analyzing the
mindsets of the opponent.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cowboys' past two games _ 22-21 and 31-24 losses to the
already playoff-eliminated Jets and Saints, respectively _ should
be a reminder that teams with nothing to lose can be extremely
dangerous. The reasons are obvious:
</P>
<P>
   They can take chances.
</P>
<P>
   They can throw caution to the wind.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, they can throw downfield every play and treat
every series as if they're in four-down territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's easy to recognize a team that has nothing to
lose,'' Jones said. ``On the other hand, that team has to overcome
the challenge of nothing to play for, i.e., the playoffs. So, one
probably offsets the other.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets and Saints certainly overcame the challenge of playing
only for pride and a paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   This underdog tag team shoved the Cowboys into a four-team
scramble for the final NFC wild-card spot. The other teams, also
7-8, are the Packers, Giants and Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Jets and, especially, the Saints used big plays to do
in the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets offensively had seven plays that went for 17 or more
yards. Five of those ``big plays'' came on drives that resulted in
19 of the Jets' 22 points.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Chrebet had catches of 23, 21 and 38 yards that led to
scores for the Jets. Curtis Martin had a 20-yard carry that led to
a touchdown (although the big play on that drive was a questionable
pass interference penalty called on cornerback Kevin Smith). And
Keyshawn Johnson had catches of 17, 21 and 35 yards _ with one
coming on a field-goal drive in the 22-21 Jets victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints offensively had six plays that went for 18 or more
yards. All six figured in the scoring of 24 points by the New
Orleans offense. Eddie Kennison caught a 51-yard touchdown pass and
had a 32-yard catch to set up a field goal. Keith Poole had
receptions of 18 and 50 yards on touchdown drives.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints' remaining seven points came on a 58-yard fumble
return by cornerback Fred Weary. That won the game.
</P>
<P>
   The last time that the Cowboys saw the Giants was Oct. 18, at
the Meadowlands. In that Monday night game, Giants running
back/return specialist Tiki Barber finished with 233 all-purpose
yards, including an 85-yard punt return for his only
return-touchdown of the season, as the Cowboys were beaten, 13-10.
</P>
<P>
   Barber also had a 56-yard catch to set up the winning field goal
by Brad Daluiso.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Cowboys are catching the Giants in the wake of coach Jim
Fassel's angry threat to his players that jobs for 2000 will be on
the line Sunday at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got one more game to redeem themselves,'' Fassel said.
</P>
<P>
   Just what the Cowboys need, an opponent with job-security issues
and possibly no playoff hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Come Sunday at 3 p.m., that could make the Giants a very
difficult team to read.

ARMS DEALER FACES CHARGES IN LAUNDERING AND TAX CASE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By LOWELL BERGMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An international arms dealer alternately an ally and a target of
American intelligence and law-enforcement agencies has been
arrested in the United States and, under a year-old indictment
unsealed in Los Angeles Tuesday, charged with money laundering, tax
evasion and bank fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The accused, Sarkis Soghanalian, a 70-year-old citizen of
Lebanon, was taken into custody by agents of the Internal Revenue
Service and the Customs Service last Wednesday as he arrived in
Miami from Paris aboard an Air France flight. He is being held in a
Miami jail pending the outcome of a hearing Wednesday, when federal
prosecutors are to ask that he be denied bail and moved to Los
Angeles for trial.
</P>
<P>
   But a law-enforcement official said on Tuesday night that
Soghanalian was also a focus of two other investigations, one
involving large cash transfers in Miami, the other arms
trafficking. The arms trafficking inquiry, the official said,
involves Iraq and is being pursued by a federal grand jury in
Washington that has a subpoena outstanding for Soghanalian's
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   All three cases are likely to be complicated by Soghanalian's
longstanding relationships with American intelligence and law
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   The charges on which Soghanalian was arrested Tuesday were
brought in an indictment that was handed up by a federal grand jury
in October 1998 but was kept sealed until he could be taken into
custody. The indictment accuses him of stealing cashier's checks
from the Great Western Bank in Los Angeles and cashing one for $3
million at a bank in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Soghanalian, once described by federal officials as the largest
arms dealer in the United States, operates these days out of Paris
and Jordan as a French-licensed arms broker. He is no stranger to
American courts. For instance, in 1991 he was convicted in Miami of
conspiring to illegally ship scores of helicopters to Iraq via
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   He was sentenced to six years' imprisonment in that case but was
released after serving less than two. His term was shortened,
according to officials involved in the case, after he had given the
Secret Service and American intelligence agencies information about
the origins of counterfeit U.S. currency _ nearly perfect $100
bills being printed and distributed in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley,
which is controlled by the Syrian Army.
</P>
<P>
   Soghanalian's career as an arms dealer was once firmly rooted in
the Cold War. In the mid-1970s, with the help of the Defense
Intelligence Agency, he arranged for the sale of Soviet-bloc
weaponry to Lebanon's Christian militias. Those weapons helped the
militias survive their war with the Palestine Liberation
Organization. Soghanalian has said, and American officials confirm,
that the PLO put a price on his head.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to Miami soon afterward, in 1979. The next year he
began to supply the Iraqi army, and that relationship made him one
of the biggest arms dealers in the world. He has claimed that
officials at the Defense Intelligence Agency approved the deals,
which included vast arms shipments from Bulgaria and other
Soviet-bloc countries to the Iraqis.

 &HT;    Landers: Fulfilling march to milestone
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ When you've coached nearly 650 games, it's tough
to remember any that stand out. At least it is for Andy Landers.
</P>
<P>
   Landers recalls road trips, long ones, the kind that make the
storyline to ``Planes, Trains and Automobiles'' seem like a kiddie
excursion.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia women's basketball coach thinks about one journey in
particular, going back more than 15 years, as he sits on the cusp
of win No. 500. The fifth-ranked Lady Bulldogs figure to give him
that against East Tennessee State in Stegeman Coliseum at 7:30 p.m.
today in their last game of the 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   But early in the 1983-84 season, Landers was a 31-year-old
hotshot out to prove that his upstart team's Final Four trip the
previous year was no fluke.
</P>
<P>
   The first stop was at Texas, then one of the powers in the sport
and at the time boasting a 36-game home winning streak. Katrina
McClain, now a Georgia and Olympic legend, was then a gangly
freshman. After stunning the Lady Longhorns, the Lady Dogs went out
to play Southern Cal, the No. 1 team in the country and defending
national champions, and featuring the bodacious Cheryl Miller.
Georgia fell by eight points, but quickly started a 10-game winning
streak by winning tournaments in Portland, Ore., and Columbus,
Ohio. Then SEC play began. The season wound up unhappily in a Sweet
16 loss to Tennessee, but not before Georgia posted a 30-3 record,
which still ties Landers' single-season personal best for
victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``That trip helped us grow up as a team, and it helped me grow
up as a coach,'' says Landers, now 47. ``We all got some confidence
from that, and it kind of put us on the map.''
</P>
<P>
   To stay.
</P>
<P>
   Since arriving in the fall of 1979 to take over a program that
had known no success, Landers hasn't experienced a losing season,
averaging 24.3 wins a year. Only three coaches have pocketed No.
500 faster than Landers, whose Georgia record is 499-149. This
season, he is just one of several top women's coaches celebrating
personal milestones.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Tennessee's Pat Summitt became only the
second women's coach to reach 700 career wins. C. Vivian Stringer
of Rutgers, third on the all-time list, just clicked over the 600
mark, and LSU veteran Sue Gunter is three wins away from the same
mark. Landers is two wins ahead of Leon Barmore of Louisiana Tech,
who could get his 500th with an upset of No. 1 Connecticut on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Landers came to Georgia from Roane State Junior College in his
native Tennessee with a reputation for being brash and having a
penchant for top-flight recruiting, then relatively new to the
women's collegiate game. He has turned out five Final Four teams,
six SEC titles and eight Kodak All-Americans, McClain and four-time
Olympian Teresa Edwards the most notable of them.
</P>
<P>
   While a national championship is the one omission from his
resume, the thought of reaching, much less surpassing, 500 wins
wasn't something he bothered to jot down on a list of goals. When
he was getting started, the women's game didn't have six-figure
coaches, full-time assistants or much of a promotional budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a prevailing thought, but I came intending on
winning a lot of games,'' he said. ``Twenty years ago, you were
just so busy. Nobody thought what the future was about. We were
trying to make the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia players in three different eras have gotten to the Final
Four. His demanding, animated style isn't the easiest to labor
under, and more than a few have transferred because of it. But many
of those who have excelled in the same enviroment _ Edwards and
McClain often have spoken of him in reverential terms _ have come
to rely on him as father figure, friend, confidant, even financial
adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we took our trip here, we knew it was where we wanted to
be because coach makes everything so comfortable,'' All-American
guard Kelly Miller said. Miller came to campus with twin sister
Coco Miller on their last recruiting visit in the fall of 1996,
then made a verbal commitment to Georgia shortly after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel right at home,'' she said. ``It's a real family-type
atmosphere. You can go in and talk to him about anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The trying times have been followed by triumph. After joining
Georgia gymnastics coach Suzanne Yoculan to win a well-publicized
salary dispute with athletics director Vince Dooley in 1994,
Landers whipped a young team into shape and it rewarded him with
two Final Four banners. After flirting with the possibility of
jumping to the WNBA in 1998 after the Millers' freshman season _
one he calls the toughest of his career _ Landers coaxed the twins
and their teammates into another surprise Final Four appearance
last March.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, he has seen fit to put these Lady Dogs through
another rigorous early-season schedule, as they already have
traveled from Virginia to Illinois to Maine to Texas to California
for tournaments. SEC play starts in earnest next week. While
Landers has gone through the routine many times before, he's not
taking the results for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not naive; I know where the wins have come from,'' he
said. ``I've been blessed to have had so many talented players and
coaches. They're not my wins. It's been a `we' thing.''

3RD ATTEMPT TO FREE PAKISTANI MILITANT
</HEADLINE>
  (SWITCHES 1st and 9th grafs, CHANGES head to reflect switch.) 
 (With INDIA-HIJACK) 
(rk) 
 By NEIL MacFARQUHAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Militant associates of Masood Azhar, a Pakistani cleric jailed
in the fight over Indian control of Kashmir, have staged three
violent attempts to barter his release, the latest being the
hijacking of an Indian Airlines jet.
</P>
<P>
   Azhar, often referred to by the Muslim religious honorific of
Maulana, has been in Indian custody since he was arrested in
February 1994 in the embattled province. After the hijacking, local
press reports quoted a police official at the high-security jail
where he is held as saying Azhar was one of the most devout
prisoners, scrupulously following the Muslim practice of praying
five times a day.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his arrest, Azhar, now 31, was editing two
religious publications that among other things urged young men to
become fighters for causes like the Kashmir separatist movement. He
was known as a leader and spiritual guide in Harakat ul-Ansar, or
the Partisan Movement, which helped recruit, train and deploy
militants in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since his arrest, the group has changed its name to
Harakat ul-Mujahedeen, or the Fighters Movement. The exact division
of responsibility in these Muslim militant movements and their
relations with other, similarly motivated political groups is often
murky.
</P>
<P>
   Something as simple as their frequent name changes are rarely
explained publicly, but one reason in this case is believed to be
that in October 1997 the U.S. State Department included Harakat
ul-Ansar on a list of about 30 groups worldwide it considers
sponsors of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department report on terrorism for 1998 said the group
operated training camps in eastern Afghanistan and claims that some
of its fighters were killed in the strikes on camps in Afghanistan
used by Osama bin Laden in August 1998. The United States made the
strikes in retaliation for the alleged involvement of bin Laden's
organization in the bombings of the American Embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania on Aug. 7, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The various Islamic groups in the region are believed to share
the logistics, costs and trainers at the camps. The Taliban militia
that controls most of Afghanistan grew out of the same religious
movement in Pakistan that gave rise to various militant
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from sharing vaguely enunciated ideological and religious
underpinnings, there are no overt connections between the jailed
cleric and his group with bin Laden. But when the United States
tried to force Afghanistan to deport bin Laden, the militant groups
in Kashmir were among the first to offer him asylum. It has also
not been fully confirmed who the hijackers are, although one is
reportedly Azhar's brother. His family has denied the report.
</P>
<P>
   Azhar's freedom has been the one unvarying demand of the
hijackers of the Indian plane now on the ground in Afghanistan. The
two previous attempts were kidnappings of Westerners. In the first
case, the victims were released, but in the second case in 1995,
one victim escaped, one was beheaded and the remaining four
tourists _ an American, two Britons and one German _ are still
missing and presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   According to Indian government officials and subsequent official
reports, Azhar was born to a wealthy, land-owning family in 1968 in
the central Pakistani city of Bahawalpur. Local press reports say
that after completing his education, he taught at an Islamic
institution in Karachi before gravitating to the publications
distributed by the religious movement he joined. He speaks Punjabi,
Urdu, Arabic and English.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, he went to Kashmir to broaden his recruitment efforts,
according to Indian officials, although his family has maintained
that he went as a journalist.
</P>
<P>
   This month marks the 10th anniversary of the bitter fighting in
Kashmir, a predominantly Muslim province, to either gain outright
independence or to join Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   An Indian government report described Azhar as a ``highly
motivated, committed and fundamentalist militant.''

CARRY-OVER NOT A STATISTIC IN THE NFL
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If recent history has taught us anything, it is to
not get too excited about what happens once one of our local pro
football teams falls out of the playoff race, mathematically or
logically.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, for instance, we had the Giants finishing up an 8-8
season to a warm round of applause, with five victories in their
last six games. They ruined Denver's bid for an undefeated regular
season. They slaughtered Kansas City. They anointed Kent Graham,
career backup, as the man to lead them, while they waited till next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Next year came. The Giants right away went into punt formation.
</P>
<P>
   This is something Bill Parcells has often warned against _ the
notion that the conclusion of one season has much to do with the
next. Next year will bring the inevitable changes in personnel, for
all. It will bring a fresh batch of injuries, the possibility that
this season's leaks will be plugged only to have others suddenly
spring up. It will bring, week after pressurized week, a game that
must be won, as opposed to the spoiler's brand of victory the Jets
and their young quarterback, Ray Lucas, have earned in six of the
last eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   They won at Miami by 38-31 Monday night, beating the crumbling
Dolphins for the second time in three weeks. Maybe next season,
Jimmy Johnson won't have Dan Marino in his immovable hair anymore.
If next season returns Vinny Testaverde healthy, maybe it also
brings another divisive quarterback controversy for us to annoy the
coach with, assuming Parcells is still the coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the league is much more volatile than it's ever
been,'' said Ernie Accorsi, the Giants' general manager. ``It's
hard not to think that when three of last season's final four are
already eliminated from the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Accorsi's Giants have done all they can to kill themselves off
yet, at 7-8, remain alive. The Jets, also 7-8, were eliminated two
weeks ago. While the Giants have been assailed for playing woefully
against Minnesota last Sunday, the Jets are this week's toast of
the town for pulling themselves to within a victory of where the
Giants left off last season. As if games the Jets squandered
earlier in the season _ which was when the Giants reduced their
playoff hopes to a prayer, not by losing their last two games to
superior teams _ don't count the same in the standings than those
squandered in December.
</P>
<P>
   That's parody for you.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, what's this parity we keep hearing about? Are
there not three teams sitting atop their divisions at 13-2? Is St.
Louis not clearly the class of the National Football Conference?
Are Indianapolis, Jacksonville and 12-3 Tennessee not certified
big-boy outfits? If those teams were old standbys _ San Francisco,
Green Bay and Dallas _ would we keep hearing about pro football's
``sad state'' of affairs?
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that this season's standings are a testimonial to
the vitality of the sport. Beyond the wild-card gridlock, the
salary cap and revenue sharing have created North America's most
democratic league, one defined by upward mobility. There is hope
for small markets, for downtrodden teams. The NFC, which won about
70 straight Super Bowls, has had its dynasties fade the last two
years. Is it embarrassing to have .500 teams make the playoffs as
the balance of power shifts? Sure, for about 20 minutes, or about
how long it takes for those teams to lose.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL owners will feel much better when the Jets' imminent
sale is completed, a franchise with a lousy stadium deal going for
over $600 million. The value of an NFL team is soaring because this
league isn't the dictatorship of a half-dozen leveraged owners in
major markets, as is baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Accorsi, who grew up a Philadelphia Phillies fan in eastern
Pennsylvania, says he has pretty much abandoned hope for his
baseball team, like fans in a dozen other major league towns. As
painful as it was watching the Rams bash his Giants two weeks ago,
he said it was also thrilling to see the surge of football passion
in baseball-crazed St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at our drafting of Michael Strahan and Chad Bratzke as
an example of what's happened,'' he said. ``We did a good job with
two young defensive ends, but we wound up only being able to pay
one. So Bratzke goes, and our loss is Indianapolis' gain.''
</P>
<P>
   Strahan gets double-teamed all season. The Giants' defense is
weakened. This system isn't perfect. No system is. But where there
is Indianapolis, 3-13 last season, there is also hope. For the
Giants and Jets, just don't create false hope by what happens this
Sunday.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sean Combs, the rap star better known as Puff Daddy,
often teeters between the privileged environs of places like the
Hamptons and the down-and-dirty street life he celebrates in song.
Last year, he wore a seersucker suit and straw boater to a polo
match; this year he helped beat up a record executive who had
angered him.
</P>
<P>
   And while Combs often mingles with Manhattan socialites and
Hollywood celebrities, his group at a West 43rd Street nightclub
early Monday morning included not only the movie star and singer
Jennifer Lopez, but his ex-convict of a bodyguard and an
up-and-coming rap performer carrying a 9-millimeter Ruger in his
waistband. That choice of companionship created a very long day for
the music impresario.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the nightclub, someone threw a stack of money at the
multimillionaire during a dispute, prosecutors said. Combs'
protege, Jamal Barrow, interpreted this to be disrespectful, the
police said, and responded by pulling out his Ruger and firing. In
the end, three bystanders were shot and slightly wounded, and Combs
spent the day in a police lockup, eventually charged with criminal
possession of a gun not used in the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Other rap performers might brandish an arrest like a badge of
dishonor. But Combs is no ordinary hip-hop performer. He is Puff
Daddy, or Puffy: the founder of the Bad Boy Entertainment
conglomerate, a man worth $53 million, and the charming poster boy
for fin-de-siecle excess.
</P>
<P>
   The conflicting messages he sends come as his business empire,
which includes a clothing line, a restaurant chain and various film
and music ventures, is struggling to keep its hold in the fickle
hip-hop world. Sales of Bad Boy records have slipped. Some
prominent Bad Boy artists have left the fold. And Combs' latest
album, ``Forever,'' has resurrected the widespread opinion that he
is a brilliant record producer but only an average rapper.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Harrell, the president of Bad Boy and the man who gave
Combs his start almost a decade ago, said that Combs' quest for the
latest in fashion and music requires that he frequent nightclubs.
But, he said, that often places him in ``very edgy situations''
that pit his Generation X mentality against his position as the
head of a business empire.
</P>
<P>
   If the situation vexes Combs, he does not let on. At a brief
news conference Tuesday, he emphasized that he had nothing to do
with the shooting and that he did not own a gun. He denied the
police allegation that he had brandished a gun in the nightclub.
``I think it is terrible that people were hurt that night,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although details surrounding the violent outbreak at Club New
York remain cloudy, those surrounding Combs' fame and success are
not. He is widely seen as a marketing genius, the man who sold
hip-hop _ including the gangsta rap of violence and sexual conquest
_ to mainstream America.
</P>
<P>
   His background is part of hip-hop lore as well as New York City
history. The son of a street hustler who was murdered when Combs
was 2 years old, he moved with his family to Mount Vernon, N.Y.,
where he attended a private Catholic school before enrolling in
Howard University. He dropped out to take an internship under
Harrell, who was then president of Uptown Records.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Combs and another promoter organized and oversold a
celebrity basketball game and rap concert at a City College
gymnasium. Seeing the doors' being locked, some ticket holders
surged forward, creating a stampede that killed 9 young people and
injured 29 others. Earlier this year, a state Supreme Court judge
ruled that the two promoters were partially responsible. Lawsuits
are pending.
</P>
<P>
   The incident did not disrupt Combs' path to success. By the
mid-1990s, he was the head of Bad Boy Entertainment, displaying an
uncanny ability to sign performers who would shape rap music for
years to come: Mace, the LOX, Lil' Kim and Faith Evans.
</P>
<P>
   But violence continued to be a leitmotif. He threatened a
newspaper photographer with a gun in 1996. In 1997, one of his
biggest stars and a close friend, Christopher Wallace, known as the
Notorious B.I.G., was shot to death. That prompted Combs to release
a song called ``I'll Be Missing You,'' an ode to Wallace that sold
millions.
</P>
<P>
   Combs also became known as much for his extravagance _ from his
$350,000 Bentley to the furs and diamonds he adorns himself with _
as for his business acumen. Last year he threw himself an
overcrowded, $600,000 birthday party at Cipriani Wall Street that
had unhappy celebrities waiting in the cold. And the Gatsbyesque
celebrations at his house in East Hampton have earned him the ire
of neighbors but the awe of his many guests.
</P>
<P>
   Reginald Dennis, a former editor at two hip-hop magazines, The
Source and XXL, said that the flaunting of wealth by Combs
contributed to an anti-Puff movement that is found today on radio
stations and World Wide Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone loved Puffy until he made his first $50 million,''
Dennis said. ``But now, he walks around with five giant platinum
chains on.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There were other problems. Some of the top artists at Bad Boy
began to chafe under Combs' control, most noticeably a group from
Yonkers, N.Y., called the LOX. Its quest to leave the Bad Boy fold
became a minor cause celebre, so much so that when Combs showed up
at a basketball game in the Bronx during a Rucker League tournament
last summer, fans started chanting, ``Free the LOX, free the LOX.''
The group has since signed with another label.
</P>
<P>
   The LOX debate was just one of Combs' worries. In April, he and
two associates were charged with bursting into the Midtown office
of Steven Stoute and beating him with a Champagne bottle, a chair
and a telephone. Associates say that Combs was upset by Stoute's
refusal to remove a scene from a music video that showed Combs
being nailed to a cross.
</P>
<P>
   Combs later apologized, and Stoute sought to minimize the
incident, amid reports that the two men had struck a business deal.
In the end, Combs pleaded guilty to a violation and was sentenced
to take a one-day course in anger management.
</P>
<P>
   A reflection of the Puff Daddy paradox came in the moments after
the eruption of gunfire in the nightclub the other night. A 1999
Lincoln Navigator registered to Bad Boy Entertainment sped from the
scene, blowing past the flashing lights of a police cruiser. Inside
were Combs, his driver, his ex-convict bodyguard, and his
movie-star girlfriend _ and a loaded pistol under a seat.
</P>
<P>
   The car swerved onto Eighth Avenue and ran 11 red lights before
a police car coming the other way blocked its path and brought
everybody back to reality.

   For months, at work and in bed at night, Bob Carr agonized over
the exodus of his insurance customers to Web sites that offered the
same products at lower rates.
</P>
<P>
   Carr had sold pension plans and 401(k) programs to businesses
for the Equitable Life Assurance Society since 1980, often making
more than $100,000 a year in commissions. But by last year, his
income had shrunk to an annual rate of about $60,000, mostly
because of competition from insurance-related Web sites like
Quotesmith.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came to the point where I couldn't sleep and I couldn't
envision myself getting up each morning and finding new clients,''
said Carr, 53, who lives in Westfield, N.J. So in November 1998, he
quit in disgust, even though he had no job lined up. For six
months, he searched for a sales position that would be ``immune''
from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in May, he landed one, with Parker Interior Plantscape,
a company in Scotch Plains, N.J., that designs floral landscapes
for office buildings and hotels. Now, instead of debating the
benefits of whole-life versus term policies with customers, Carr
consults with companies on whether palm trees or ficus will thrive
better in their atriums.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that he has no green thumb, Carr says he
also has no fears that customers will abandon him for the Internet.
``Nothing can happen that can cause me to lose sleep,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   These days it is not just car dealers and retail clerks who fear
for their jobs as the World Wide Web encroaches on their territory.
Increasingly, people in traditional corporate sales jobs like
insurance, hotels and newspapers and magazines are debating what
will become of them as online selling takes off. Many of them,
seeing what they view as the writing on the wall, are bailing out
before they have to.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, many will have to. Sales of business-to-business
products through Internet-based corporate networks are expected to
increase from at least $95 billion this year to $500 billion in
2002, according to the GIGA Information Group in Cambridge, Mass.
That would eliminate the need for many of the calls that corporate
sales representatives make to purchasing managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lone-ranger salesman is getting rarer and rarer in the
business-to-business world,'' said Neil Rackham, a consultant who
wrote ``Rethinking the Sales Force'' (McGraw-Hill, 1999).
``Face-to-face selling is very expensive, and because of that the
Willy Loman becomes an expensive way to tell your customers about
your product.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet poses a long-term threat to the entire sales
profession, one of the biggest parts of the American economy.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, America's 14 million
sales representatives make up 12 percent of the work force. Robert
Davenport, a vice president with Hay Management Consultants in
Jersey City, says that percentage has held steady for nearly 15
years, but he and others predict that it will fall into the single
digits within five years, meaning that several million jobs, mostly
in retail, will disappear as consumers switch to buying online.
</P>
<P>
   So far, corporate sales representatives have weathered the
storm. But once big corporations get their online selling systems
up to speed, or once the economy inevitably turns sour, John
DeVincentis, a consultant based in Solebury, Pa., said, ``then we
will see some bloodletting.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

<P>
   Michael Pusateri, who spent 10 years in sales for Marriott
hotels, working as a vice president for sales and overseeing the
company's e-commerce business, is also among those who have chosen
not to wait and see how the new economy might affect careers. In
April, he left Marriott to join Proxicom, a Web development company
in Reston, Va., as head of sales and marketing. He says he was
lured to the new industry more by its income potential than by any
immediate fears of losing his hotel job. Still, as he debated
making the change, he remembers asking himself, ``Do I stay in the
marathon and get the silver ring, or do I jump now and try to get
the brass ring?''
</P>
<P>
   He jumped, and it looks as if he got the gold ring. Since he
joined Proxicom, where he has stock options, its stock has shot up
from $13 to more than $90. ``If I lived my whole life at Marriott,
I never would have made that much money,'' said Pusateri, who is
40.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Powell took the leap from hotel sales to an Internet
company, too, but for different reasons. He had spent 26 years
working at hotel chains like Loews and Sheraton. But as more
companies were swallowed up in mergers, his sense of loyalty to his
employer was replaced by a dread of losing his job, and when
Sheraton, a division of Starwood Hotels and Resorts, asked him to
relocate from Atlanta in October, he took a buyout instead.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, he became vice president for global sales at
PlanSoft, an Internet company that provides hotel information for
companies planning corporate meetings. Since then, Powell, 49, has
persuaded several other experienced hotel sales representatives to
join him, including Susie Lichenstein, who spent 13 years with
Sheraton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather be on this side of the fence than working in sales
for a hotel company,'' said Ms. Lichenstein, who is based in
Raleigh, N.C. ``Once this type of product takes off _ and it could
be five years or 15 _ you probably won't need all that manpower on
the other side of the fence.''
</P>
<P>
   That sense of uncertainty weighs heavily on some career
decisions. Carr had misgivings about leaving Equitable, which he
says treated him well, but he knew that the Web's impact on his
income would intensify. ``I'm middle-aged,'' he said, ``so the
question becomes: Do I do something now and be comfortable and earn
a good living, or do I try to hang on and get to 55 or 57 and it's
too late to start something new?''
</P>
<P>
   He has not soured on the Web, though. He is using his new
knowledge of plants to help design Parker's first Web site, and he
has done some shopping online, though he admits to a twinge of
guilt. ``Some other salesman is suffering,'' he said, ``because I
can make my choice on the Internet.''

INDICTED SCIENTIST WORRIED HE'D LET SECRETS SLIP, EX-BOSS SAYS

   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. _ A supervisor of the weapons scientist
charged with mishandling the country's most sensitive nuclear
secrets testified Tuesday that the scientist, Wen Ho Lee, told him
in February that he might have inadvertently disclosed secrets to a
foreign country.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying in the second day of an unusually detailed bail
hearing for Lee, the supervisor, Richard Krajcik, said Lee had made
the statement after acknowledging that he had failed an FBI lie
detector test that had asked whether he had passed secrets to
China.
</P>
<P>
   But one of Lee's lawyers asked Krajcik, the deputy director of
the Los Alamos National Laboratory's nuclear weapons division,
whether Lee could have been referring to information in a scholarly
paper he had published with the knowledge and approval of the
laboratory. Krajcik said he and Lee had not talked about
publications in February, but he said that at a meeting with Lee
and the FBI in March there was discussion of whether Lee in his
paper might have accidentally disclosed secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Krajcik said he had told an internal security official about
Lee's anxious comments but had not informed the FBI for perhaps
five months. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lee was indicted this month on 59 counts of illegally removing
highly classified data from the Los Alamos weapons laboratory,
where he worked until he was fired in March, accused of security
violations. For five years he has been a focus of investigations
into whether weapons secrets, including some about the
sophisticated W-88 warhead, were disclosed to China. But he is not
charged with espionage.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment accuses Lee of improperly putting highly
classified weapons secrets on unsecured computers and making tapes
of them. Officials have said this is an enormously risky breach,
but have also said there is no evidence that any outsider obtained
the information.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesay's testimony was unusual because it went to the questions
of whether Lee spied on behalf of China, and whether he provided
secrets on the W-88 warhead, issues not included in the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   In a bail hearing this month, a federal magistrate agreed with
the prosecutors that Lee presented a great danger to national
security if released and refused him bail. Tuesday's hearing is an
appeal of that decision.
</P>
<P>
   In one indication of what he may decide, Judge James Parker of
U.S. District Court asked several witnesses what harm it would do
if Lee were released on a form of highly restricted home detention
with limited access to telephones and other means of communication.
The judge said that perhaps Lee, a naturalized citizen who is a
native of Taiwan, would even be prevented from speaking Chinese to
assure that agents monitoring him would be able to understand any
comments.
</P>
<P>
   With witnesses providing highly detailed testimony about
everything from the way in which Los Alamos computers work to how a
foreign power might use the secret data, and with defense lawyers
trying to rebut them through laborious cross-examination, the
hearing has taken on the air of a highly spirited trial.
</P>
<P>
   Senior government officials say unusually detailed evidence is
being presented partly to counter criticisms that Lee was singled
out for prosecution.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The depth of the security risk of Lee's actions was underscored
by testimony Tuesday from some of the nation's top nuclear
scientists. Paul Robinson, president of the Sandia National
Laboratory and a weapons policy adviser, said any release of the
secrets could ``truly change the world strategic balance.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense presented into evidence, and to reporters in the
crowded courtroom, the results of a lie detector test that Lee took
in 1998, in which he was asked about passing secrets to
unauthorized people.
</P>
<P>
   The defense said a report by experts at Wackenhut Services,
which conducts polygraph exams under a contract with the Department
of Energy, indicated that Lee was telling the truth in denying that
he had spied or passed along secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers said they had not been provided with the
specific results of the polygraph test that the FBI gave Lee in
February.

ADVERTISING: DOT-COM VULGARITIES ASIDE, A PRETTY GOOD 1999 FOR ADS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Before any look back at the creative output of
Madison Avenue in 1999, let's get this out of the way: Dot-com.
Dot-com. Dot-com. Dot-com? Dot-com!
</P>
<P>
   As the year raced by, the advertising frenzy for Internet
marketers, offline as well as online, built to a fever pitch. Alas,
the frantic efforts to get consumers to notice the dot-coms
produced some of the most tasteless ads ever to appear in the
mainstream media.
</P>
<P>
   Mercifully, the vulgarity was sometimes eclipsed by hilarity, as
discerning advertisers and agencies realized that the funny bone
can often be the human anatomy's most sensitive part.
</P>
<P>
   What follows is a recap of the bright lights and burned-out
bulbs of the year. The shining moments are first, in alphabetical
order.
</P>
<P>
   AMAZON.COM: The holiday television campaign for Amazon.com
presented a chorus delivering paeans to online gift shopping in an
affectionate sendup of early 1960s variety series like ``Sing Along
with Mitch.'' The jest was cleverly reinforced with period editing
techniques and production values like the cheesy graphics
superimposing song lyrics on screen. The subtle message: using high
technology can be as easy as following the bouncing ball. Agency:
FCB Worldwide, part of True North Communications.
</P>
<P>
   CRACKER JACK: To reintroduce Cracker Jack snacks, now owned by
the Frito-Lay unit of PepsiCo, a commercial conveyed the spirit of
fun that once epitomized the venerable brand by deftly delivering
wry sight gags. The best: a pony emerging as the prize from a
make-believe package, the ``really big bag.'' Agency: Goodby,
Silverstein &AMP; Partners, part of the Omnicom Group.
</P>
<P>
   DOCKERS: Though Levi Strauss cannot find the right formula to
sell its denim jeans to younger shoppers, the company has
reinvigorated sales spiels aimed at that market for Dockers khaki
pants, with commercials ably blending sex appeal, music and humor.
In one spot, the buff, boyish hero was doused repeatedly in a dunk
tank to show how Dockers stand up under repeated washings. This
campaign stood up under repeated watchings. Agency: FCB.
</P>
<P>
   GAP: What is it about khaki slacks that inspired creativity? In
addition to Dockers, Gap Inc. delighted consumers with a khaki
campaign, this one a sequel to ``Khakis swing,'' perhaps the best
spot of 1998. As attractive dancers sashayed to go-go, country and
soul tunes, viewers wondered whether ``Khakis waltz'' or ``Khakis
polka'' would come next. Gap's holiday campaign also used music and
dance to good effect as models cavorted to an odd medley of
``Sleigh Ride'' and ``Ice, Ice Baby.'' The theme, ``That's
holiday,'' however, may have created a credibility gap among
grammarians. Agency: in-house.
</P>
<P>
   M&AMP;M's: The antics of the anthropomorphic characters that peddle
the M&AMP;M's line of candies for a unit of Mars Inc. were never more
delicious than in a commercial featuring comic actor Patrick
Warburton. This spot, like others in the series, toyed with the
advertising convention of food products wanting to be consumed;
Warburton admonished three M&AMP;M's noshing from bags corresponding to
their flavors. ``You don't eat your own kind,'' he scolded. ``It's
unnatural.'' Even after they switched bags, he remained
unmollified, muttering a line that ought to become a
``Seinfeld''-style catch phrase, ``That's just disturbing.''
Agency: BBDO New York, part of the BBDO Worldwide unit of Omnicom.
</P>
<P>
   MTV: It was a remarkable year for promotional campaigns by and
for the MTV cable network owned by Viacom Inc. Commercials created
in-house celebrated the power of music to overcome adversity. Spots
by FCB spoofed so-called blaxploitation movies of the 1970s with
soulful verisimilitude. Wacky ads by Fallon McElligott New York
City about an imaginary dysfunctional family named Jukka reminded
viewers of MTV's off-kilter sensibilities. And a public service
campaign, ``Fight for your rights,'' made a powerful statement
against hate crimes with a spot by Public Interest Productions for
the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network, which featured
Judy Shepard, mother of the murdered student Matthew Shepard.
</P>
<P>
   MONSTER.COM: A brilliant commercial, for the Monster.com job
search World Wide Web site operated by TMP Worldwide, broke through
the dot-com clutter without crudeness. The spot presented
preternaturally prescient children voicing incongruously
unambitious vocational aspirations: ``I want to have a brown
nose,'' ``I want to claw my way up to middle management,'' ``I want
to be a yes man.'' It was a shrewd way for Monster to claim to be
the source for the job you always really wanted. Agency: Mullen
Advertising, part of the Lowe Group unit of the Interpublic Group
of Cos.
</P>
<P>
   NIKE: It was, as they say in sports, a career year for Nike Inc.
after several seasons of inconsistent advertising. A stunning
commercial saluted the dedicated jock, the core Nike consumer, with
an unflinching presentation of scarred and injured athletes, who
were serenaded with the song ``You Are So Beautiful.'' Spots
promoting the U. S. women's soccer team captivated viewers with
their dry wit. Baseball spots spoofed home-run mania by encouraging
pitchers to learn to hit (``Chicks dig the long ball'') and
attributing superhuman powers to Ken Griffey Jr. Agencies: Goodby,
Silverstein, soccer; Wieden &AMP; Kennedy, the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE TRADING: Campaigns for three online stock brokerage
services were effective as well as entertaining, a rare feat in the
overcrowded dot-com domain. Spots for Ameritrade by Ogilvy One
Chicago, part of the Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Worldwide unit of the WPP
Group, took an audacious tack, using a geeky young pitchman who
uttered phrases like ``Let's light this candle'' to liken investing
online to rebelling against the establishment. Commercials by
Goodby, Silverstein for the ETrade Group used the soft sell to
remind investors that knowing when to buy may be less important
than knowing when to sell (e.g., when that movie studio whose stock
you own begins believing its own hype). And TD Waterhouse defied
expectations with a campaign by Emmerling Post that actually forged
strong connections between celebrity endorsers (Jackie Chan, Geena
Davis, Phil Jackson) and the service they peddled.
</P>
<P>
   VOLKSWAGEN: A commercial for the VW Passat, sold by Volkswagen
of America, pleased viewers with its double punch lines. The spot
depicted a man flirting with a woman whose car is stopped next to
his at a traffic light. Punch line one: The man has a child in the
car with him. Punch line two: She has a child in her car, too. Are
they would-be adulterers? Single parents, free to flirt? A married
couple driving separate cars? Look for the sequel, ``Ships That
Passat in the Night.'' Agency: Arnold Communications, part of
Snyder Communications.

<P>
   Now here are 10 points of darkness, also alphabetically:
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T: Paul Reiser, unfunny in the final seasons of ``Mad About
You,'' also rings up wrong numbers in a campaign to promote
long-distance calling plans for the AT&AMP;T Corp. In the worst
commercial, for the One Rate Seven-Cent Plan, he mercilessly mocked
an actor speaking with a British accent. It's madness for ads aimed
at international callers to portray xenophobia as a virtue. What's
next, a campaign featuring John Rocker? Agency: Young &AMP; Rubicam
Advertising.
</P>
<P>
   BUD LIGHT: A surprising spate of tacky spots during Super Bowl
XXXIII foreshadowed what consumers endured the rest of the year.
For instance, Anheuser-Busch resorted to bathroom humor in a spot
about two shoppers choosing between buying Bud Light beer or toilet
paper. Agency: DDB Chicago, part of the DDB Worldwide unit of
Omnicom.
</P>
<P>
   CNET: A provocative campaign for Cnet Inc., a producer of online
and television programming about computers and technology, was
deemed so deplorable, it came to symbolize the excesses of dot-com
advertising. If the commercial about a man's unexpected encounter
with a proctologist didn't offend you, the spot with the fetal pig
probably did. The outcry was loud enough to force Cnet to replace
the campaign _ and the agency that created it, Citron Haligman
Bedecarre.
</P>
<P>
   FORD FOCUS: Live commercials for Focus, a new compact car sold
by the Ford Motor Co., were dead on arrival. The freshness and
spontaneity promised by Ford executives before the spots ran proved
harder to find than Toyotas in Michigan, primarily because the TV
networks required that scripts be submitted in advance. It didn't
help that the production values made the spots appear taped.
Agency: J. Walter Thompson, part of WPP.
</P>
<P>
   GAP: Not every Gap campaign was a winner. Commercials urging
``everybody'' to wear cords, leather and vests were as dispirited
as their khaki and holiday counterparts were energetic. The casts
behaved like zombies who had exchanged their personalities for Gap
gift certificates _ or jobs at Gap stores. Agency: in-house.
</P>
<P>
   HOTJOBS.COM: According to an extravagant commercial, the ``hot''
in Hotjobs.com, an Internet employment service, referred not to the
heat generated by the jobs available on its Web site but to the
scantily clad young actresses, secretaries and bimbos that men can
meet at work. Now there's a sure-fire strategy: alienate half your
potential customers. Agency: McCann-Erickson Detroit, part of the
McCann-Erickson World Group unit of Interpublic.
</P>
<P>
   JUST FOR FEET: An appalling, insensitive commercial for an
athletic footwear chain named Just For Feet stunned Super Bowl
viewers. The spot showed a black Kenyan runner being treated like
an animal, hunted, captured and drugged by white-hunter types. Just
For Feet executives apologized and discontinued the commercial,
blaming the agency, Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi Rochester, and suing for
malpractice. Just For Feet recently filed for federal bankruptcy
protection, encouraging those who believe karma is shaped like a
boomerang.
</P>
<P>
   PEPSI ONE: The Pepsi-Cola Co. unit of PepsiCo is oh-for-two with
campaigns for Pepsi One, a reduced-calorie soft drink. The
introductory spots in 1998 were derided for a bombastic star turn
by the brand's pitchman, Cuba Gooding Jr. A replacement this year,
lamely copying the cult film ``Reservoir Dogs,'' fared no better.
The bad Gooding soon vanished from the campaign faster than his
turkey, ``Instinct,'' vanished from theaters. Pepsi-Cola executives
denied he was dismissed. Sure, and Pepsi One outsells Coke. Agency:
BBDO New York.
</P>
<P>
   7Up: Cadbury Schweppes, desperate to recoup from two failed
campaigns, ran commercials for its 7Up soft drink, carrying the
theme ``Make 7Up yours,'' that were replete with awful double
entendres. It was a sad, shameful comedown for a brand once sold as
a tasteful friend: ``You like it. It likes you.'' Agency: Y.&AMP; R.
Advertising.
</P>
<P>
   TRICON: It was harder for Tricon Global Restaurants to generate
sales from a campaign centered on ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The
Phantom Menace'' than it was to find fans of Jar Jar Binks.
Commercials that brought together characters representing the three
Tricon fast-food chains _ KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell _ proved
sillier than Carrie Fisher's hairdo in the original ``Star Wars.''
That helped doom the promotion, which ``actually slowed momentum''
for Tricon restaurants, the company's chairman conceded. But then,
what else could be expected from spots showing a Colonel Sanders
lookalike fighting alien invaders with a ``talking'' chihuahua and
a perky young Pizza Hut employee? Agency: TBWA/Chiat/Day, part of
the TBWA Worldwide unit of Omnicom.

STARS' HULL STILL GIVES IT A REAL SHOT
</HEADLINE>

By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANALYSIS
</P>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Brett Hull, too, has grown old. Battered, he
says, by a game that changed before his very eyes.
</P>
<P>
   His days of 70-goal seasons in St. Louis have long since passed,
swept away by an NHL littered with clogged neutral zones,
clutch-and-grab defenders and penalty-killing specialists, turned
into a succession of fond memories that have surfaced now as he
stands one goal away from reaching 600.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I was still a pure goal scorer, but you are not allowed
to be anymore,'' Hull said. ``I think it's in the back of my mind
that every day when I come to the rink that the game is going to
change and it's not going to be such a struggle to go out there and
have fun, and it will be the way it used to be. But it never is.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Hull, too, still has that something that fires the
imagination, can still stop 17,001 fans' breath for a moment with a
simple gesture.
</P>
<P>
   He has only to slide his hands up the shaft of his hockey stick
to bring back memories of a day when the game dripped with scoring.
He leaves no doubt in anyone's mind what is coming next in moments
like these, for a one-timer has almost always followed.
</P>
<P>
   His hands act independently, a reaction to a pass flying his
way. They slide back down the shaft as the stick rises above his
shoulder. His knees flex in unison. Then, in less than the time it
takes to sneeze, he swings like Tiger Woods approaching a tee shot.
He crushes the puck with the impact that Babe Ruth's bat probably
had on an incoming fastball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think as a coach, when you coach against him, you can feel
the goal coming,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``He's sniffing
around the puck. You don't have a handle on the damn thing. You
can't get it out, and you just know it's going in.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull has done that 599 times in his 898 NHL games, bringing him
to the cusp of history, a single one-timer away, from becoming only
the 12th player in NHL history to score 600 goals. He'll get his
next chance tonight against the New York Rangers at Reunion Arena.
One more goal and he'll add his name to a list that includes Wayne
Gretzky, Mario Lemieux, Phil Esposito, Bobby Hull, Marcel Dionne,
Mike Gartner, Dino Ciccarelli, Steve Yzerman, Jari Kurri, Gordie
Howe and Mark Messier.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everybody on that list is retired now.
</P>
<P>
   Players like Lemieux and Gretzky played in an era of numbers,
departing just as the numbers began declining. Only Brett Hull,
Yzerman and Messier remain. All have adapted to a defense-first
mentality necessary to survive into NHL 2000 and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Hull, too. Although, he looks to be suspended between then
and now sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A goal scorer nowadays is going to have to be a person banging
around in the crease area,'' Hitchcock said. ``Hull's a throwback
to where you didn't have to do that. He's one of the few players
left in the NHL who can score from 40 feet. You don't find that
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Players now score goals. In Hull's day, he was a goal scorer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mario Lemieux and Wayne Gretzky obviously are great goal
scorers, but they didn't have the shot like him,'' Stars forward
Guy Carbonneau said. ``It's a shot that requires a certain amount
of cockiness because you have to be so sure of something that isn't
so sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Carbonneau insists that Hull has a personality perfectly suited
to a one-timer _ a bit brash, a little cocky, just like the shot. A
one-timer requires a certain amount of risk. The shot has the
quickness of a wrist shot and the velocity of a slap shot. But when
it gets right down to it, the shot is all about the positioning.
That's the part that Hull has always excelled at.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's learned a lot from his dad, where to be on the ice, where
the shooter should go, that quiet spot on the ice,'' Stars forward
Mike Modano said.
</P>
<P>
   The quiet spots were his spots when he roamed the ice in St.
Louis, gliding around until he landed in just the right one to add
another goal to his list. He wishes Stars fans could've seen the
player he was in St. Louis, where he scored 500-plus of his 600
goals. He'll tell you that he doesn't feel he's been that player in
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``My overall game is lacking confidence because it's not my
style of game anymore,'' Hull admitted. ``I guess I'm a throwback
to the old style of game that I long for.''
</P>
<P>
   He's also a battered player now, not a young goal scorer; but he
still has his shot that fires the imagination, can still stop one's
breath for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put him in a one-timer, and he'll shoot 20 pucks out of 20 on
net,'' Hitchcock said. ``You've got some players wide right, wide
left, over the top, in the glass ... but this guy is boom, boom,
boom.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he isn't the player he once was. He instead is almost
something better, the last of quickly vanishing breed of pure goal
scorers who used to roam the ice. He's there as a reminder, and
when he's gone, maybe we'll forget. But it's unlikely, for his
images aren't likely to fade, but instead grow stronger with time.

INSIDE FOES' 20, TEXAS GIVES FOOTBALL TO ITS SCORING MACHINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Texas coach Mack Brown began fall practices looking for
someone to replace a Heisman Trophy winner who led the nation in
rushing and scoring before moving on to the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   In fullback Chris Robertson, he found a player who emerged as
the Longhorns' leader in touchdowns (11) and rushing average (5.3
yards per carry). Yet, the sophomore touched the ball only 17
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people look back at the stats from this season, they're
going to beat me up for not giving him the ball more,'' Brown said.
``It's gotten to the point that, every time you hand him the ball,
you think, `He can't score again.' But he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicknamed ``Mr. Touchdown'' by coaches and teammates, Robertson,
a reserve who plays primarily in goal-line situations, has become
so adept with his leaps into the end zone that he averages 3.9
points every time he touches the ball heading into Saturday's
Cotton Bowl matchup with Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson's past seven carries have yielded six touchdowns, all
from the 1-yard line. His only score that did not come from a
goal-line set occurred in a 69-17 rout of Stanford, when Robertson
cut back against the grain on a sweep and wound up with a 68-yard
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking about scoring every time I touch the ball,
whether I'm on our 1-yard line or theirs,'' said Robertson, a
6-foot-1, 213-pound sophomore. ``I adopt the mind-set that I can't
be stopped, regardless.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown was looking for that type of attitude after the Texas
offense bogged down with regularity once inside the opponents'
20-yard line early in the season. Robertson had no carries in the
season opener, when Texas lost to North Carolina State, 23-20. He
had no carries against Rice, when Texas ground out 209 yards but
settled for four field goals _ three of them within 32 yards _ in
an 18-13 victory. The Longhorns' lone touchdown came on an 11-yard
pass to Kwame Cavil.
</P>
<P>
   After that game, Brown began turning to Robertson in goal-line
situations and the tap-in touchdowns became routine. Robertson, a
former high school hurdler, ranks as the team's most gifted leaper.
More important, said Brown, he doesn't mind clattering between the
tackles _ the lone drawback on the resume of Hodges Mitchell, the
team's 5-7 starting tailback and leading rusher (1,343 yards, nine
touchdowns, 5.2 yards per carry).
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris can really jump, and he's the toughest runner we've
got,'' Brown said. ``He really likes that role. At the goal line,
you need a very aggressive mind-set. He's the best person to bring
that to our offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, if the recruiting calendar had fallen differently,
Robertson might have adopted a different perspective for Saturday's
game. Arkansas, like Texas, recruited him. But as a hurdler, not a
running back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Track was always my first love,'' said Robertson, who finished
sixth in the Class 4A state meet in the 300-meter hurdles as a
junior at Denison High School. ``It still is. But by the time
Arkansas contacted me, I'd already signed with Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   In all likelihood, Robertson said, he would have opted to play
college football if he'd needed to weigh offers in both sports
because of the potential for an NFL career. His father, Larry,
played two seasons as a running back with the Atlanta Falcons, and
Robertson always knew he had the versatility to play multiple
positions, a plus in the minds of most NFL general managers.
</P>
<P>
   Texas coaches said Robertson will be allowed to choose during
spring drills whether he wants to remain at fullback, where he
could succeed departing starter Ricky Brown, or shift to
linebacker, a position he played in high school.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his status as Texas' primary touchdown scorer, Brown
said Robertson played an equally pivotal role on special teams. A
member of Texas' punt coverage unit, Robertson has five tackles and
has forced one fumble.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been incredible on special teams,'' Brown said. ``He
became the leader on our punt coverage unit after the problems we
had against North Carolina State.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Wolfpack turned three blocked punts into 16 points in
their upset victory, Texas coaches put Robertson _ who plays an
inside blocker spot _ in charge of calling protections. Texas has
suffered only one blocked punt in its past 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made a big difference,'' Brown said. ``That's another
place where his aggressive mind-set really helps.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning football games, after all, involves more than merely
scoring touchdowns.

FBI, ATF JOIN WEAPONS INVESTIGATION OF AIRCRAFT MECHANIC
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAPEVINE, Texas _ The FBI and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms joined the investigation Tuesday of Jere Wayne
Haney, an American Airlines aircraft mechanic suspected of
possessing materials to make explosives.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI is investigating whether Haney is linked to extremist
groups that have threatened violence, agency spokeswoman Marjorie
Poche said. Grapevine police investigators said they found
literature from white supremacist and anti-government groups during
a search of Haney's Grapevine apartment late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Haney, 42, was arrested after officers with the Dallas/Fort
Worth Airport Department of Public Safety pulled him over during a
traffic stop Monday. A search of his 1984 Dodge Ram Charger
revealed about 70 miniature bottles of alcohol, the type airlines
use on flights, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Haney gave airport officers consent to search his apartment, the
officers said. When they saw the ammonium nitrate, they notified
Grapevine police, who found weapons and other materials in his
house and arrested him.
</P>
<P>
   Haney was released from jail Tuesday after being arraigned on a
charge of felony possession of bomb-making materials. American
Airlines issued a statement detailing his employment record, but
declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   ATF agents seized the weapons found in Haney's apartment _ 12
guns, including four assault-type rifles and four handguns.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they also found 50 pounds of ammonium nitrate
and a coil of detonation fuse, along with a book that details how
to make a plastic explosive. The instructions call for ammonium
nitrate with a concentration of 33 percent, said Grapevine police
spokesman Bob Murphy. The ammonium nitrate found in Haney's
apartment was 34 percent, Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   Also found was a copy of ``The Turner Diaries,'' a novel by
William Pierce about a plot to bomb a federal building in
Washington, D.C., Murphy confirmed. The novel gained notoriety
after it was connected to Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh.
</P>
<P>
   Grapevine investigators also found military trip flares and
pyrotechnic devices, Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the items taken from Haney's apartment wouldn't
cause suspicion, Murphy said. ``It's the totality of the
circumstance,'' he said. ``With having all the components, the
books telling how to make the bomb, all those things form one big
picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said authorities found no evidence that would connect
Haney to an extremist group. ``There seemed to be a hodgepodge of
that kind of material,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI and ATF are conducting separate investigations. ATF
agents are looking into whether Haney legally owned the weapons.
The FBI is probing the extremist angle.
</P>
<P>
   Grapevine police are investigating why Haney had the 50-pound
bag of ammonium nitrate and the fuse in his apartment, Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no reason to believe he had any particular target now
or any imminent plans to make a bomb,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   Haney's lawyer, Tim Evans of Fort Worth, declined to comment on
specifics of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy that we secured his release,'' Evans said. ``It's
too early to comment on details of the case because I'm just
learning about them. As developments occur, we may have something
to say at that time.''

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The American Airlines statement said Haney has worked for the
airline since July 1991. In compliance with federal law, American
did an employment background check when haney was hired, but not a
criminal background check, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Haney was honorably discharged from the Army in 1984 before he
worked as a mechanic for several regional and national aviation
companies, including McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics, the
airline said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law requires airline mechanics to inform their employers
of criminal convictions, the statement said. But Haney never
informed American of a conviction he had for driving while
intoxicated, the airline said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Tarrant County criminal court records, Haney has
been arrested several times since 1995, although some cases were
dismissed as part of a plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations included one count of unlawful carrying of a
weapon, one count of misdemeanor possession of marijuana, one count
of assault with bodily injury and two counts of driving while
intoxicated. In a plea agreement in September 1997, the marijuana,
weapons and assault cases were dismissed when Haney pleaded guilty
to driving while intoxicated, court officials said. He served a
45-day sentence and paid a $1,038 fine, court officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In March this year, a case of driving with a suspended license
was dismissed, court officials said. A DWI charge against Haney in
Keller northeast of Fort Worth is pending, court records show.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome of Haney's latest case, American will
probably fire him if the miniature liquor bottles if are company
property, airline spokesman John Hotard said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Roland Herwig said
Haney has had an air frame and power plant mechanics license since
1992. The FAA has no record of disciplinary action against him,
Herwig said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Briskman, a spokesman for the Anti-Defamation League in
Dallas, said Haney's name did not show up in the organization's
national database of hate groups and other extremists.
</P>
<P>
   Haney's neighbors said he kept to himself and never had visitors
or made noise.

   SAN ANTONIO, Texas _ Quarterback Rashard Casey, getting the
first start of his career in place of injured Kevin Thompson,
bamboozled Texas A&AMP;M with his arm as well as his more ballyhooed
legs in leading Penn State to a 24-0 victory Tuesday in the Alamo
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Casey, who had alternated with Thompson at quarterback most of
the season for the Nittany Lions, drew the start with Thompson
sidelined with a shoulder injury. The junior responded by throwing
for one touchdown and running for another as Penn State gave Coach
Joe Paterno his 20th victory in 30 bowl appearances.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, before a sellout Alamodome crowd of 65,380, helped
ease the pain of a late-season collapse for Penn State. The
13th-ranked Nittany Lions, contenders for a spot in the Sugar
Bowl's national championship game before losing their last three
games, ended the season with a 10-3 record.
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M, hurt by four interceptions against quarterback Randy
McCown, never got on track offensively. Except for one drive, the
Aggies failed to sustain any offensive consistency in the first
half. And their placekicking problems prevented them from scoring
on the sole opportunity they had.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 7-0, A&AMP;M put together a 17-play march that fizzled at
the Nittany Lions' 27 early in the second quarter. Punter Shane
Lechler, continuing to handle placekicking duties for block-prone
Terence Kitchens, tried a 44-yard field goal that was short and
wide to the right.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State didn't take long to capitalize. Casey, one play after
avoiding a sack by blitzing cornerback Jay Brooks to scramble for
17 yards on third and 11, then threw a 45-yard scoring strike to
Eddie Drummond to build the Lions' lead to 14-0.
</P>
<P>
   Drummond raced by right cornerback Sedric Curry and caught the
perfectly thrown ball about a yard deep in the end zone. It was
Drummond's sixth scoring reception of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Casey, despite making his first start of the season, was
considerably more poised than his A&AMP;M senior counterpart McCown.
Especially early.
</P>
<P>
   McCown was intercepted on two of his first three pass attempts
of the game. The latter was snared by safety Derek Fox, who snaked
back 34 for yards for his first career touchdown to give the
Nittany Lions a 7-0 lead with 6 1/2 minutes left in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   McCown's initial interception came on A&AMP;M's first offensive play
from scrimmage. Rolling right under heavy pressure from blitzing
linebacker LaVar Arrington, McCown threw up a lob that cornerback
David Macklin grabbed at the Aggies' 40.
</P>
<P>
   The Nittany Lions were unable to capitalize, however. They
reached the Aggies' 21, where a dubious personal foul call of
roughing the kicker on A&AMP;M's Chris Taylor prompted them to take
Travis Forney's 38-yard field goal off the board and sustain the
drive at the 11. But a penalty moved them back and Forney was wide
right on a 30-yard attempt.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M managed only 77 yards of offense in the first half to Penn
State's 158. The Nittany Lions averaged 6.1 yards per play to the
Aggies' paltry 2.6.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies opened the third quarter with a crisp drive that
reached the PSU 14. But on third down, McCown's right arm was
whacked by Arrington just has he threw, and the ball fluttered to
backup linebacker Ron Graham for McCown's third interception.
Graham was playing because starter Mac Morrison had been injured
earlier in the A&AMP;M drive.

ROSE BOWL OF '63 WAS A CLASSIC OF THE CENTURY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM McCONNELL  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ University of Southern California. University of
Wisconsin. Look closely, students. You'll notice there is no ``d''
in either name.
</P>
<P>
   That bit of academic trivia came to fruition on the athletic
field on Jan. 1, 1963, when USC and Wisconsin met in the 49th Rose
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   In a wild, wide-open game, the Trojans outlasted the Badgers
42-37. Clearly, it was not a day for D, as in defense.
</P>
<P>
   The shootout set 11 Rose Bowl records. More important, it
ushered in a new era in Rose Bowl history.
</P>
<P>
   Once USC and Wisconsin were finished exchanging scores in the
Arroyo Seco, two things became apparent. The Big Ten's domination
had ended, and the era of the 3-yards-and-a-cloud-dust offense was
becoming a distant memory.
</P>
<P>
   With the teams combining for 12 touchdowns, 19 penalties and 69
passes, it also became obvious the Rose Bowl was in need of lights.
The final minutes of the 1963 game were played in a gathering
gloom. Had there been any further delays, the game would have ended
in darkness.
</P>
<P>
   All things considered, the 1963 game was probably the most
exciting in Rose Bowl history. For once, this was a game that
matched its pregame hype.
</P>
<P>
   USC was 10-0 and ranked No.1 in the nation in both wire service
polls, and Wisconsin was 8-1 and ranked second. The Badgers had won
the Big Ten title, surviving a 14-7 midseason loss at Ohio State by
winning their final four games.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the majority of oddsmakers favored the Badgers. Here's
why: USC and Wisconsin had three common opponents that season. USC
beat Notre Dame 25-0, UW won 17-8; USC defeated Illinois 28-16, UW
won 35-6 and the Trojans edged Iowa 7-0, and the Badgers won 42-14.
</P>
<P>
   The game also provided two great matchups. At quarterback, it
was Pete Beathard of the Trojans vs. Ron VanderKelen of the
Badgers. At wide receiver, it was Hal Bedsole of the Trojans vs.
Pat Richter of the Badgers.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin was coached by Milt Bruhn, in the seventh season of a
successful 12-year (1955 to 1966) run at the Madison campus. USC
was led by John McKay, coaching his first Rose Bowl game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think we could beat Wisconsin, I knew it,'' McKay
said in a 1997 interview. ``We were by far the quicker team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wisconsin was a typical Big Ten team of that era in that they
tried to just overpower you at the line of scrimmage. But I felt
our quick little guys would be able to run around their slow big
guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``And for three quarters, we were able to do just that.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. USC's high-octane offense, with Beathard, Willie Brown
at tailback, Ben Wilson at fullback and Bedsole at wide receiver,
struck early and often. With Beathard throwing four touchdown
passes, USC led 42-14 when it scored on the first play of the final
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In the 48 previous Rose Bowls, no team had ever rallied to win
after falling behind by three touchdowns. Now, Wisconsin was four
touchdowns down and was rapidly running out of time, and daylight.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Bruhn and his coaching staff threw out the ball-
control stuff and told VanderKelen to throw on every play.
</P>
<P>
   He led the Badgers downfield with short passes, most of them to
wide receivers Richter and Gary Kroner. At the Trojans 13, fullback
Lou Holland scored on a draw play. The point-after kick made it a
42-21 game.
</P>
<P>
   The USC offense failed to move the ball and punted. VanderKelen
methodically moved Wisconsin down the field, capping the drive with
a 4-yard scoring pass to Kroner. The Badgers trailed 42-28 with
nearly seven minutes remaining after the extra point.
</P>
<P>
   USC then began falling apart. After failing to get a first down,
the snap from center on the punt attempt sailed into the end zone,
where the Trojans covered the ball for a safety. Clearly, momentum
had shifted to Wisconsin, which trailed 42-30.
</P>
<P>
   Following USC's free kick, VanderKelen struck again, hitting
three consecutive long pass, the final one to Richter for a 19-yard
TD. The Badgers trailed by five 42-37 with the extra point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was I worried about losing the game?'' McKay said. ``Heck no,
I was worried about getting killed. The USC alumni would have
murdered me if Wisconsin had won.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seriously, what happened was this. I think myself and my
coaching staff got a little too concerned about getting everybody
into the game instead of winning the game. But that last Wisconsin
touchdown got our attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that, our first-string offense went back out there and
was able to get a couple first downs, re-establish field position,
and keep that big quarterback of theirs off the field.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, here's the game by the numbers: Wisconsin had 32
first downs to 15 for USC and outgained the Trojans 486-367.
VanderKelen finished 33 of 48 for 401 yards and two touchdowns. He
also ran 17 yards for a touchdown in the first half. Beathard was 8
of 12 for 190 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Beathard and VanderKelen shared Player of the Game honors. The
sportswriters had picked Beathard, but in light of VanderKelen's
late heroics Bill Schroeder of the Helms Athletic Foundation
</P>
<P>
   the award's sponsor felt obligated to name co-players of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just ran out of time, that's all,'' said a very tired
VanderKelen after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Geez, the thing I remember most about the game was that the
fourth quarter seemed to take forever,'' McKay said. ``But it was
worth the wait. We won, and we were No.1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a happy man. However, I would have been a whole lot
happier had the final score been 42-14 instead of 42-37. I'm sure
the fans loved that fourth quarter. For me, it was agony.''

ALBANY VOTES TO TOUGHEN LOBBYING LAW
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The state Senate approved a bill Tuesday that
would toughen the law regulating lobbying in New York for the first
time in a generation, ending an unusually fractious debate over how
far the state should go in trying to restrict and illuminate
behind-the-scenes efforts to influence policy.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which passed the Assembly last week and is expected to
be signed by Gov. George Pataki, would require lobbyists to detail
more information about their activities in Albany, adopt a similar
system of disclosure in the state's large localities and impose
stronger penalties for violating the law. It would replace
relatively weak rules passed at a time when lobbying expenditures
were at a fraction of today's levels and techniques were far less
sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   But the measure largely skirts the issue that dominated the
deliberations: whether to prohibit lawmakers from accepting meals
and other gifts from lobbyists, a longstanding if veiled practice
in Albany that came under scrutiny after The New York Times
reported in July that Philip Morris, the cigarette giant, had spent
hundreds of thousands of dollars on such favors.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would bar lobbyists from giving lawmakers and other
officials gifts worth more than $75, a limit not significantly
different than the current one.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even as the Senate approved the measure, 51-1, all of its
members were renewing a promise they made this month to decline
most gifts from lobbyists voluntarily. And the sparring over
whether to allow gifts to some extent distracted from the
far-reaching nature of other parts of the bill _ especially
considering that earlier in the year, officials here showed no
interest in changing the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Several senators said they supported the Assembly bill only
grudgingly, and attacked the Assembly for declining to support more
stringent gifts rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major change that we sought is absent,'' Sen. Seymour
Lachman, a Brooklyn Democrat, said. ``We're taking one step
backward, and a step and a half forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Lynch, a spokeswoman for Assembly Speaker Sheldon
Silver, a Manhattan Democrat who doggedly fought the gift-ban
provision, called the criticism misguided. ``The way to get to the
heart of the problem is to stiffen fines and other penalties and
ask for more disclosure,'' not ban gifts, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Blair Horner, an expert on lobbying who is legislative director
of the New York Public Interest Research Group, said he was
disappointed that the backlash over Philip Morris' lobbying did not
spur more of an overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six months ago, all these changes would have seemed
monumental,'' Horner said. ``But as a result of the revelations of
Philip Morris' illegal activities, the Legislature and the governor
had a chance to hit a home run on lobbying reform. Unfortunately,
they swung and missed.''

NASDAQ, THE LATEST SHOWOFF IN TIMES SQ.  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, N.J.)   By CHARLES V. BAGLI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Times Square has long been a place to sell everything
from underwear to cigarettes, but only in the '90s, when it seems
every tourist from Iowa and every cabby from Pakistan owns a few
shares of Microsoft, has Wall Street joined the glaring neon mix of
come-ons at the crossroads of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Nasdaq, the electronic stock market, plugged in
the largest and most expensive video screen in the world, adding
another swirl of blues and reds to the dizzying kaleidoscope of
lights and billboards in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq's eight-story, $37 million sign on the skyscraper at 4
Times Square was designed to give the stock market a public face in
the global market that can compete with its better-known rival, the
New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   It stands across the street from the Dow Jones electronic
zipper, and soon it will face the splash of electronic signs that
will adorn the Reuters building, now under construction at Broadway
and 43rd Street. Those signs will be only five blocks south of
Morgan Stanley's giant, amber-colored stock and financial zippers
strutting across the face of 1585 Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an eye-catcher, all right,'' said Travis Lloyd, a home
builder from Dallas, as he gazed up at the Nasdaq sign on Tuesday
night from a corner in Times Square. ``It's not Kansas any more,
that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether Nasdaq will get the global
recognition it craves from the 1.5 million office workers and
tourists who pour through Times Square every day. When many New
Yorkers and American companies forsook the seedy Times Square
district in the 1970s and 1980s, unknown Japanese companies threw
up their own billboards, recognizing that the crossroad still
attracted millions of tourists from around the world. Now everyone
wants to be there.
</P>
<P>
   But some visitors find the neon-drenched landscape so crowded
with ads and video screens that it forms a visual dissonance,
making all but the colors indistinguishable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fantastic,'' said Helen Kenworthy, from Barnegat Light,
N.J., ``but there are so many people pushing you along you don't
really have time to look.''
</P>
<P>
   At a party celebrating the new sign and the opening of Nasdaq's
marketing operation, Frank G. Zarb, the chairman of the National
Association of Securities Dealers, which owns Nasdaq and the sign,
said it was money well spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wall Street has come to Main Street,'' Zarb said. ``It's
really a commitment to the average family, which more and more
makes up the population of investors. When you come to New York
from Des Moines, we're going to be here.''

NEW YORK BOARD TO BUY OUT BALANCE OF CHANCELLOR'S CONTRACT
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Less than a week after deciding not to renew the
contract of schools Chancellor Rudy Crew, the New York City Board
of Education decided Tuesday to buy out the rest of his contract
immediately and to begin a comprehensive review of his management
practices.
</P>
<P>
   In a closed-door meeting, the board agreed to give Crew the
remaining six months of his $245,000-a-year salary, plus sick
leave, vacation and moving expenses, several officials said.
Officials said the board also agreed to let him collect a city
pension even though his contract expires three months before he
would normally become eligible for it.
</P>
<P>
   The board set a deadline of Jan. 12 for the selection of an
interim chancellor, though some members said it could happen before
then. A permanent successor, they said, will be in place by late
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Some board members said they wanted to examine an increase in
the hiring of what they called high-priced managers under Crew's
leadership. Others said they wanted to consider having the central
board take over efforts, like teacher training, that have been the
province of local schools and districts.
</P>
<P>
   They said the management review would begin as soon as an
interim successor to Crew was hired.
</P>
<P>
   The invocation of an out-of-control bureaucracy _ particularly
by board members close to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani _ revived a theme
of the mayor's from four years ago, before Crew arrived in New
York. Giuliani's constant attacks on what he called a bloated
bureaucracy helped to drive out Crew's predecessor, Ramon Cortines,
who cut thousands of jobs but still could not stay in the mayor's
good graces.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to buy out Crew's contract, which expires on June
30, ended days of speculation about how much longer he would stay
on the job. It was the latest development in the stunningly swift
end to Crew's four-year tenure. On Thursday, the eve of winter
break for the city's 1.1 million schoolchildren, the board voted
4-to-3 not to exercise a one-year renewal clause in Crew's
contract.
</P>
<P>
   The board decided Tuesday to conduct the search for a permanent
chancellor on its own rather than using an outside panel. William
Thompson, board president, said that search committees used in the
past had been cumbersome and slow and that this search needed to
end quickly.
</P>
<P>
   But Mark Green, the city's public advocate, said a board-driven
search would be vulnerable to politics in an election year, when
the mayor is expected to run for the U.S. Senate. But Thompson
noted that a board-run search had produced Crew, proving that the
board could act quickly and effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Crew, who has been vacationing in Washington State, is not
expected to return to work. Officials said that his two deputies,
Lewis Spence and Judith Rizzo, had been asked to remain on the job
as a way of ensuring continuity, and they were expected to agree.

   USC, which signed highly touted guard Desmon Farmer in November,
now has one scholarship remaining.

<P>
   Bibby was busy recruiting Tuesday afternoon, driving to San
Diego to watch 6-6 swingman Teyo Johnson of Mira Mesa High. Johnson
is considering USC for both football and basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Turner won't dress: Senior forward Jarvis Turner, who has played
just three games because of a stress fracture in his foot, returned
to practice Monday, but took Tuesday off and will not suit up for
tonight's game with Northwestern.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby said Turner would be ready for USC's Pacific-10 Conference
opener against Washington State next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs some rest, but he should be back by then,'' Bibby
said.
</P>
<P>
   More bench play?: Bibby has been giving USC's reserves more work
with the starters in practice this week, but it remains to be seen
if that will actually translate into playing time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing if our other guys can step up and play,'' Bibby
said. ``To see where they fit in.''
</P>
<P>
   Bibby mentioned freshman guards Nate Hair and Malachi Thurston
and junior-college point guard Rashad Jones as players he is using
more in practice.
</P>
<P>
   What about Fletcher?: Another player who could use some minutes
is freshman point guard Sandy Fletcher, who is a defensive back on
the football team. Fletcher could be the Trojans' No. 2 point guard
by conference play, but Bibby said he is still rusty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the things Sandy is doing out on the floor, but he
hasn't played basketball in six or seven months,'' Bibby said.
``Sandy is behind in that respect, but he can help us.''
</P>
<P>
   Pac-10 prediction: Bibby was asked if he thought USC could
finish in the top four of the conference, considering the Trojans
have started out 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure of that,'' Bibby said. ``I think realistically, I
don't know. Hopefully, we can get four guys to play their `A' game
and then win some games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to have more than one or two guys playing well. The
(nonconference) games have shown us what we need to work on. We're
not going to have a flawless team going into the Pac-10.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Pac: USC has four players leading the conference
in individual statistical categories. Forward Sam Clancy leads in
scoring (17.5 points), forward Brian Scalabrine leads in 3-point
shooting (56 percent), guard Brandon Granville leads in assists
(8.0 per game) and guard Jeff Trepagnier leads in steals (4.3 per
game).
</P>
<P>
   Clancy is also third in the conference in rebounding (8.5 per
game), Granville is fourth in steals (2.45 per game).
</P>
<P>
   As a team, the Trojans lead in steals (125), turnover margin
(plus-5.91) and offensive rebounds (15.45).

WOODS TRANSCENDS GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DAVIS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Phoenix) - Tiger Woods clearly remembers when Tigermania first
became reality. It happened in 1997 after his record-setting
victory in the Masters, and it had nothing to do with the huge
gallery he drew the next week at the Byron Nelson Classic in Fort
Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was engaged to (golfer) Kelli Kuehne, dating (model) Tyra
Banks and seeing Fergie (Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York) on
the side . . . all in the same week,'' Woods said Tuesday in
reference to the scrutiny and media attention he received as a
rookie in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Golf is his stage, but the world is Woods' audience. At the age
of 23, he has transcended the game, and perhaps even sports, in
Jorda nesque fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Put him in a golf tournament and fan interest multiplies. Turn
on a TV and it's hard not to see him. Soon his name might be on the
car you drive. Nike swooshes are everywhere, and so, it seems, is
Woods' influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger has appeal much like a Michael Jordan or a Charles Bark
ley. He crosses over just golf,'' Phoenix area golf pro Tom Lehman
said. ``Ask any kid and they all know who Tiger Woods is, even if
they aren't involved in golf. It's the kind of popularity of a
super famous athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   Few people in any walk of life at his age have created such an
empire, with staggering endorse ment contracts and the Tiger Woods
Foundation, an organiza tion aimed at helping young peo ple reach
their potential by teaching the values that apply to the game of
golf.
</P>
<P>
   That organization created the $3.5 million Williams World
Challenge, which tees off Wednesday at Grayhawk Golf Club in
Scottsdale and will benefit the foundation and the host
Thunderbirds' First Tee program. Woods, of course, headlines a
field of 12 of the world's top-ranked golfers. The winner will
receive $1 million, and Woods said he will donate whatever amount
he wins to charity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's in the process of transcending the sport, and
this year he really put a stamp on that and made a statement,''
said Woods' agent, Mark Steinberg. ``Everybody has always talked
about him as this huge public figure and dominating presence, and
he really justified all of that this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't represent (Jordan) so I don't know what that's like,
but I do know that everywhere we go in the world Tiger is
recognized. Without question he's one of the most dominating
personalities in sports right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, in fact, turned to Jordan for advice in 1997 after
winning the Masters by a record-setting 12 strokes, and says the
two have a ``brother relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Woods put together one of the greatest seasons in the
history of pro golf, winning eight PGA Tour titles, the most of any
golfer in 25 years, and earning a record-shattering $6.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, he's won 10 of his last 14 events and this week was
named the Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year. It was fitting
that he won awards this year bearing the names of Harry Vardon,
Byron Nelson, Gene Sarazen, Gary Player, Arnold Palmer and Jack
Nicklaus for his various accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   With that success have come more riches. He recently signed a
deal that reportedly will pay him $20 million to $25 million to
repre sent Buick, which has plans to create a ``Tiger Special
Edition'' model. A new deal signed with Nike in August is estimated
to be worth $80 million to $90 million.
</P>
<P>
   Such figures can create resent ment, just as they did with
Jordan, raising expectations and adding pressure to perform and
appear at every imaginable function.
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot to handle for a man who will turn 24 on Thursday,
but Woods has been dealing with pres sure since turning pro at 21,
as evidenced by that Fort Worth expe rience.
</P>
<P>
   He admits that he hasn't always handled it well but says that
has changed as he has matured.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten a little older, and I'm starting to understand not
only my life on the golf course, but more importantly, my own life
off the golf course,'' he said. ``I was living in a whole new
state, doing something I had never done for a career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are big changes, and it was not easy to go through those
changes. I think this year I felt so much more comfortable about
the tour and my life. I got everything in a nice balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Going out to dinner or to see a movie still are a challenge,
mainly because of autograph seekers, but Woods says he has learned
to adjust and doesn't even attempt to wear disguises.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can do anything anyone else can do, but there are
consequences, and you have to understand those consequences when
you go through that,'' he said. ``Before, I perceived it as an
intrusion in my life. In essence it is, but more importantly
they're just trying to be nice, give you encouragement or ask for a
simple autograph and make some one else happy. And that's not a bad
place to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods' greatest influence proba bly has been on youth, which he
says was his goal from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix area golfer Phil Mickelson says he's seen a big
difference in the number of young fans at golf tournaments over the
three-plus years that Woods has been on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a real connection to kids that I think is wonderful,''
Lehman said. ``He is in a great position to have a real impact on
the world around him, and I think he's doing a really good job of
making it a positive impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's because Woods knows exactly what he wants that
impact to become.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think minority involvement is going to be my biggest impact
on the game,'' he said, ``and whether I win a lot of tournaments or
not, I think my mark will probably be the kids that have followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going to the next millennium, I think it's going to be the
beginning of something. When my career is all said and done, I want
to make golf look like America, like a melting pot. Diverse, not
only in ethnic background, but religious choice and sexuality.
That's how I want golf to look.'' &QL;

PENNSYLVANIA COUPLE CHARGED WITH ABANDONING DISABLED SON
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Del.)   (jw) 
 By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The chief executive of a Pennsylvania chemical company and his
wife have been arrested on Monday after leaving their severely
disabled son in the emergency room of a Delaware hospital with a
note saying they could no longer care for him, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, Richard and Dawn Kelso of Exton, Pa., were arrested
Monday and charged with abandonment of a child after they wheeled
their 10-year-old son, Steven, into the emergency room of a
Wilmington hospital on Sunday morning, telling a receptionist they
wanted him admitted, the police said. The receptionist went to look
for a nurse and when she returned, the Kelsos were gone, said Lt.
Vincent Kowal, a spokesman for the New Castle County Police
Department in Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the hospital, the Alfred I. duPont Hospital for
Children, said the couple had left behind several boxes containing
the boy's clothing, toys and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The Kelsos were released on Tuesday after spending Monday night
in jail, Kowal said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelso, 62, is president of the PQ Corp., a $500-million-a-year
company that is the world's largest producer of sodium silicates, a
glass product derived from sand. Ms. Kelso, 45, is well known for
her advocacy on behalf of children with disabilities. Those who
know the family say the son suffers from cerebral palsy, frequent
seizures and other medical problems that require round-the-clock
nursing care.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really loved that child, and they have been through so
much, but you don't know what it's like until you've walked a mile
in their shoes,'' said a friend of Ms. Kelso, Susanmarie Trout, 45,
whose teen-age daughter is also severely disabled. ``Before we
judge them, it's important to know what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   A woman who answered the telephone at the Kelsos' home hung up
Tuesday night before she could answer questions from a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   But the police and hospital officials said the note the couple
left with the receptionist made it clear that they no longer wanted
to care for their son.
</P>
<P>
   Terri Volker-Greenley, a spokeswoman for the hospital, declined
to release the contents of the note, but said it discussed the
couple's frustration with their son's condition. She said the
hospital had been treating Steven for many years, and that he
needed specialized care.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does need a lot of attention, but this kind of thing is
extremely rare for us,'' Ms. Volker-Greenley said.
</P>
<P>
   Steven, who remains hospitalized, has been taken into state
custody, Ms. Volker-Greenley said. ``They are working diligently to
find an appropriate environment for the child,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being confined to a wheelchair, Steven depends on
a ventilator and is often plagued by debilitating seizures. Ms.
Trout said the boy had been hospitalized ``countless times'' over
the years, and that Ms. Kelso had recently become sick. ``This
woman is a fighter,'' Ms. Trout said. ``She doesn't give up
easily.''
</P>
<P>
   During the past decade, Ms. Kelso has testified in Washington
and in Harrisburg about the need for more public spending on behalf
of disabled children. She is a member of the National Council on
Disability and has helped raise money for organizations serving
those with mental and physical disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   As chief executive of the Valley Forge-based PQ Corp., Kelso
oversees 69 plants in 18 countries with a total of 1,600 employees.
Calls left on the company's voice mail system seeking comment were
not returned Tuesday night.

COLUMN: POLICE TRIALS IN ALBANY: NO SURE THING
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By MATTHEW PURDY   
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ James Lundy was waiting with his young son
outside an Albany restaurant for a takeout order when four
narcotics officers apparently mistook him for a drug suspect. The
officers, he said later, threw him against a car, hit him and
arrested him for assault, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest.
All the charges were later dropped.
</P>
<P>
   When Lundy, who is black, accused the white officers of
violating his civil rights, an all-white jury in Albany agreed with
him, awarding $35,000 in damages.
</P>
<P>
   The 1993 Lundy verdict, and other jury awards in police
brutality cases around Albany, suggest that the description of
Albany juries presented to the public recently is too simple. Since
the trial of four white police officers accused of killing Amadou
Diallo was moved from the Bronx to Albany, lawyers and civil rights
advocates in the state capital have been quoted in news accounts
describing Albany juries as reflexively pro-police. They predicted
that even the 41 shots fired at Diallo would probably not sway a
jury.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Albany criminal juries rarely sit in judgment of police
officers accused of excessive force. The chief aide to the Albany
district attorney said the office did not initiate investigations
of police officers, relying instead on the Police Department to
investigate its own officers and recommend criminal charges. But
that almost never happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the boss always says, we're basically a reactive agency,''
said Larry Wiest, chief assistant prosecutor to Sol Greenberg, the
longtime district attorney. ``This is not to say that citizens
don't file complaints about boorish, insensitive and abusive
behavior on the part of police officers.'' But he said that since
these complaints are filed with the department, prosecutors may
never hear about them.
</P>
<P>
   Allegations of police abuse usually reach court through private
civil rights actions filed in federal court. In those cases, Albany
juries have hardly been knee-jerk police defenders, and have often
sided with people claiming police misconduct. There is not a
torrent of cases _ perhaps 10 over the past 15 years _ but there
are enough to show that Albany juries, like juries elsewhere, can
sometimes surprise.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, a jury in federal court in Albany awarded $405,000 to
four former SUNY students, all members of minority groups, who said
Albany police officers roughed them up and arrested them while
responding to complaints of a noisy party.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, a federal jury in Albany found that police officers in
neighboring Schenectady violated the civil rights of a white mason
named John Rodick, and awarded him $3.5 million. He had complained
that officers pulled him naked from his bed, hit him and took him
into custody after mistaking him for a suspect in a Florida murder.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Luibrand, an Albany lawyer who represented Rodick, said
juries in Albany identify with officers. But he added, ``If you can
convince them of police wrongdoing, they act with fairness and
focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning a civil case is easier than proving guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt, as is required in a criminal case. The four
officers in the Diallo case will be tried in state criminal court,
before a jury from Albany County, which is overwhelmingly white.
Juries in federal cases in Albany are drawn from 12 counties
stretching to the Canadian border, making those jury pools even
whiter than those from Albany County only.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Mishler, a civil rights lawyer in Albany, said that even
given the victories in federal court, juries in Albany remained
largely hesitant to rule against officers. But he said the biggest
obstacle to airing police abuse was ``the reluctance on the part of
law enforcement agencies to pursue allegations of brutality.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiest, of the district attorney's office, said the office didn't
initiate investigations of police officers or anyone else because
of slim resources.
</P>
<P>
   But John Dorfman, a special prosecutor appointed to pursue a
recent criminal case of excessive force by two police officers,
said the district attorney ``constructed many roadblocks to a
successful prosecution.'' Dorfman said the district attorney's
office would not give the victim, a college basketball player,
immunity from prosecution resulting from his testimony. The man
then refused to testify at the trial, and the jury cleared the
officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conventional wisdom has been that this a free-fire zone
for police officers,'' said Terence Kindlon, the lawyer in the
Lundy case. But, he said, ``It's not just that there are a bunch of
rednecks here who are going to look up and see a cop and say he's
right and everyone else is wrong.''  &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ A few weeks ago Phil Jackson said he planned to
limit Kobe Bryant's possessions in end-of-quarter situations,
concerned that the 21-year-old star isn't quite ready to handle the
clock-management and shot-selection decisions at such critical
moments.
</P>
<P>
   But there was Bryant on Monday against Dallas, handling the ball
in the closing seconds of a tied game. While confirming some of
Jackson's misgivings Bryant reverted to his solo act, controlling
possession before shooting with 8.6 seconds left, rather than
running a play or waiting until the last second to shoot he also
showed why it's nearly impossible !ital!not!off! to put the ball in
his hands. Bryant used his athletic ability to create a good shot,
forcing a foul, then converted the game-winning free throws in the
108-106 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson chatted afterward with Bryant about being more aware of
the clock Dallas had time to attempt a potential game-winning shot
but he was pleased otherwise. The key, according to Jackson, is
getting a good shot, not simply waiting until the last second
because you're supposed to.
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt like he could get to the basket, for a possible basket
or a three-point play.'' Jackson said. ``You can't fault (Bryant),
because the reality is he has to have the confidence to know what
he can do in those situations. But he's also got to know he's got
to use his teammates as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Alarm clock: The Los Angeles Lakers' lethargic effort against
Dallas may have been unavoidable they were coming off an emotional
win against San Antonio, and the hapless Mavericks hardly inspire
fear in opponents but that doesn't mean the performance was
acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   But it may have been needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a wake-up call because we were kind of going through
the motions a little bit. It's natural when you have a nine-game
winning streak to get complacent,'' Bryant said. ``A game like
(Monday) scares you a little bit, helps you get ready for Phoenix
(today.)''
</P>
<P>
   All-Star owner, too?: Bryant has vaulted into second place among
Western Conference guards in the All-Star voting, meaning he'd join
Shaquille O'Neal, the top vote-getter at center, in the starting
lineup. Should the Lakers keep up their current pace, Jackson would
be the coach.
</P>
<P>
   However, Bryant isn't having quite as much success in his latest
venture owning the Olimpia Milano, an Italian professional
basketball team. Bryant purchased half ownership in mid-December,
hoping to restore luster to the once-proud team.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't quite worked out that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We suck,'' Bryant said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Actually they're mediocre, winning two of five games since
Bryant took over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better then before. We were 5-8,'' Bryant said. ``I'm
shooting for the general manager of the year award.''

RESTAURANT CLOSURES POSE NEW YEARS DILEMMA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By By Gregory J. Wilcox 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES -- It looks like the biggest Y2K dilemma consumers
might confront Friday night is finding a place to grab a quick bite
to eat.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there are plenty of high-priced restaurants and hotels
offering New Year's Eve parties. But for those planning a quiet
night at home with a meal delivered in a box, the pickings are
slim.
</P>
<P>
   An unscientific survey of casual dining establishments across
the region has found that the decision on whether to open New
Year's Eve is being made on almost a menu by menu basis. Some will
conduct business as usual, but most are closing early.
</P>
<P>
   Domino's is one place ready to answer the call; its
corporate-owned restaurants will be open until 1 a.m. and its
franchised restaurants are expected to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand that a lot of people are going to celebrate with
family and friends at home rather than go out to big bashes,'' said
Tim McIntyre, a Domino's vice president. ``There seems to be a
trend this year that people want to celebrate this milestone in a
subdued fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, that's what is compelling management of Jerry's
Famous Deli Inc. to close at 5 p.m. on Friday, despite the
prominent ``open 24 hours a day'' note on its 600-item menu.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employees don't really want to work New Year's Eve,'' said
Chief Executive Officer Isaac Starkman. Jerry's seven Southern
California restaurants will re-open Saturday in time for breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   It will be business as usual at the Pizza Cookery on Ventura
Boulevard in Encino, with the store open the regular hours 11 a.m.
to 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   And staffing will be the regular six workers, said manager
Mashid Moseni.
</P>
<P>
   She expects to be busy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call in a little early. We just need a little bit more time,
maybe an extra half hour,'' she said. ``But if it is busier than
normal, we might stay open a little later.''
</P>
<P>
   A big night is also anticipated at Northridge-based Waiters on
the Run, which delivers regular menu items from area restaurants,
said co-owner Matt Dome.
</P>
<P>
   He normally has eight to 10 drivers working a weekend shift, but
will have 10 or 12 on the streets Friday night to handle orders
from the 50 restaurants he services.
</P>
<P>
   He expects a 50percent increase in deliveries from last New
Year's Eve and his clients are split about 50-50 on whether they
will close early Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be more business than normal, but I don't
think it will be totally out of control,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two national pizza chains Dallas-based Pizza Hut and Papa John's
of Louisville, Ky. are closing early. Most of their restaurants
will start to cool the ovens at 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Pizza Hut spokesman Jay Allison said that each region has the
option to close its stores early; Los Angeles was quick to end the
worknight early.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made the decision several months ago. We're doing it to
give our employees the opportunity to spend time with their
families or friends for the (changing) millennium. This is a
once-in-a-lifetime event,'' Allison said.
</P>
<P>
   Papa John's local stores, operated by the company's biggest
franchisee, Birmingham, Ala.-based PJ America, took a democratic
approach to the dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   ``The millennium is such a big event we decided to put it to a
vote and most of our stores decided to close at 9 or 10,'' said Jak
Walker, the company's operations director. ``It was kind of a fun
thing. Most of the time in this business, you're thinking about the
bottom line but PJ decided to go with the people first.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has 11 stores in Los Angeles and Ventura counties
and only three or four voted to stay open.
</P>
<P>
   Domino's views those decisions by its competitors as a market
opportunity. The decision to stay open until 1 a.m. was made after
the company learned of its rivals' plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Pizza Hut and Papa John's closing about 9, this provides
us with a great opportunity to win over new customers,'' said
McIntyre.
</P>
<P>
   McIntyre says staying open late makes cents, which add up to
lots of dollars. After all, even in nonmillennium years, the
holiday is typically one of Domino's top five business days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always gear up big for this. It has the potential to be the
biggest night in our history and with some of our competitors
closed, we are ready for it,'' McIntyre said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We deliver to a lot of parties and a heck of a lot of baby
sitters and pizza is the No.1 food among baby sitters everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Every Domino's employee will receive double their hourly wage
from 8 p.m. until closing and employees will have a chance to win a
$25 bonus each hour. And every employee working at midnight will
have a chance to win a trip for two to DisneyWorld in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have taken the negative route and basically told
everyone they had to show up for work. We chose not to do that,''
McIntyre said.

PEOPLE STILL FLOODING INTO ARIZONA  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By SHAUN MCKINNON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Phoenix) - It's as if everybody in North Dakota and most of
their neighbors in South Dakota just picked up and moved to
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   That's how much we've grown in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona will wrap up the 1990s this week as the nation's
second-fastest growing state, after Nevada, according to Census
Bureau esti mates released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's population, an esti mated 4,778,332 as of July 1, grew
30.4 percent from 1990 to this year, making Arizona the union's
20th largest state, having surged past Alabama, Kentucky, Louisiana
and Minnesota since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   That's more than 1.1 million new residents: births minus deaths,
plus new arrivals minus the folks who changed their minds and
split.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nearing 5 million people, which means it's a large state
now,'' Census Bureau demographer Marc Perry said. ``My sense is the
growth rate probably won't stay this high forever, but then people
were saying years ago that Phoenix wouldn't keep growing the way it
has.''
</P>
<P>
   The figures released Wednesday are estimates only and will be
replaced by the end of next year with results of the official 2000
census. But this set of numbers gives demographers a good last look
at the 1990s and allows them to make some guesses about the future.
</P>
<P>
   Most significantly, the count proj ects that Arizona's
congressional delegation will grow by two when the House of
Representatives is reapportioned in 2001, giving the state eight
House seats, in addition to its two senators.
</P>
<P>
   Election Data Services, a Wash ington, D.C., consulting firm,
esti mates in a report also released Wednesday that, based on
current projections, seven states will gain seats in the House: two
each for Arizona, Geor gia and Texas; and one for Califor nia,
Colorado, Nevada and Florida. New York and Pennsylvania would give
up two seats; Connecticut, Illinois, Mississippi, Ohio, Okla homa
and Wisconsin would lose one.
</P>
<P>
   Metro Phoenix remains the en gine driving Arizona's growth,
Perry said, mirroring other fastest-growing states this decade,
where rapidly developing cities attracted a seem ingly endless
stream of newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   And immigrants tell the story of Arizona's explosive growth this
dec ade. Six of every 10 new residents moved here from somewhere
else, according to the bureau, a pace barely changed in nine years.
</P>
<P>
   California, with 33 million peo ple, remains the nation's most
popu lous state. But barely 3 percent of its new residents this
decade moved into the state, and most of those were from other
countries. Domesti cally, throughout the 1990s, more people moved
out of California to another state than moved to Califor nia.
</P>
<P>
   Connie Swenson has smoothed the way for hundreds of new
Arizonans. As president of Arizona Insights Relocation Center,
Swenson helps find apartments, homes, schools.
</P>
<P>
   Moving to the state is no longer a seasonal thing, she says.
People are arriving almost every week of the year, taking a break
only for the few days the week after Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been extremely steady for us for the last five or six
years,'' Swenson said. ``And we're now seeing not only corporate
reloca tions, but self-motivated moves. People are coming here for
the Arizona lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   What was once a client list with a heavy Midwestern accent now
in cludes new residents from all over, she said, from every
economic strata and in every age group.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of families with children,'' she said, ``but
we're also seeing a lot of single people, men and women.''
</P>
<P>
   Swenson is seeing a good sample, according to the Census
Bureau's Perry, who said Arizona is attracting a wide cross-section
of new resi dents, probably a lot younger than some people might
guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of people who move to Phoenix and to Arizona are younger,
in their family formation years,'' he said. ``They move (to
Arizona) with children or as singles preparing to marry and raise
fami lies.''
</P>
<P>
   There were more than twice as many births as deaths in Arizona
from 1990 to 1999, the bureau estimates, a sign of a younger
population, Perry said. More signifi cantly for the long-term, he
said, there were more births last year in Arizona than there were
out-of-state immigrants, which changes the way growth affects a
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all population increases have the same impact,'' he said.
``If you have a baby born in a state, it has different needs than
someone moving there as a 25-year-old, who has different needs than
someone retiring there as a 65-year-old.'' &QL;

COMPTROLLER'S AUDIT FINDS EVIDENCE OF ATTENDANCE FRAUD AROUND THE
STATE 
</HEADLINE>
 (rk) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two weeks after Gov. George Pataki charged that dozens of New
York City schools had inflated their attendance figures to get more
state aid, State Comptroller Carl McCall said Tuesday that
attendance fraud was actually a statewide problem.
</P>
<P>
   McCall said in a news release that his office had audited the
attendance records of New York City and six other school districts
around the state, and that the audits found ``errors and
discrepancies'' in every district's records.
</P>
<P>
   But McCall's audits, which studied records the school districts
kept from July 1995 to March 1998, also found that New York City
probably could not get more state aid by inflating its attendance
records. The city's aid is already capped below the level at which
attendance figures become a significant factor, so even if dozens
of schools were padding their attendance rolls, the city's share of
state aid would not increase, the audit found.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's report, released Dec. 13, said that a state
investigation had uncovered ``patterns of widespread, systemic
abuse'' in attendance-keeping practices at city schools. But the
report contained no information about which schools were padding
attendance, who was responsible or exactly how much the alleged
fraud cost the state. Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew called the
report ``a political hack job'' and said that Pataki was trying to
force his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Board of Education voted 4-3 not to renew Crew's
contract, and several members cited Pataki's report as one of the
reasons. Pataki is a Republican allied with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
who endorsed Crew's ouster. McCall is a Democrat and a supporter of
Crew.
</P>
<P>
   One of McCall's audits examined New York City schools, while
another studied the attendance records of the school districts in
Bethpage, Buffalo, Cohoes, Hudson, Katonah and Oneonta. All of the
districts needed to tighten their attendance-keeping systems, the
audits said. McCall said that the State Department of Education
should issue guidelines on how to do so. State education officials
should also monitor districts known to have sloppy attendance
systems, the audits said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contrary to all the media coverage, this isn't just a New York
City problem,'' McCall said in a statement. ``We have to fix the
system and make sure that school districts report data correctly.''

TOUTED RECRUIT STAYS DOWN TO EARTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Grand Prairie, they've been talking about B.J. Johnson since
he was a 14-year old sophomore. This was small town chit-chat in a
not-so-small town of 110,000 inhabitants and two high schools.
</P>
<P>
   But word traveled fast in Grand Prairie, even faster than
Johnson on a football field. And the word has been the same for
three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good kid.''
</P>
<P>
   You can't coach that. You also can't take that for granted, not
these days.
</P>
<P>
   The other stuff is relevant. Stuff like the estimated 5,000
pieces of recruiting mail delivered to the Johnson home in two
years. The 55 scholarship offers from Division I schools. The trip
to Hawaii and the Hula Bowl next month to be honored as one of the
top 22 schoolboy players in the country. The trip to Chicago in
February to be introduced as a ``Parade'' All-American.
</P>
<P>
   All that speaks to superior athletic ability. But ``good kid''
says so much more, particularly when it comes from the home front.
The people who know you best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone else talks about the 40-yard speed, the receiving
yardage, and the touchdowns,'' said Willis Johnson, B.J.'s father.
``But at home we talk first about the 3.7 grade-point average. And
then we might get into football.''
</P>
<P>
   According to some of those who calculate such things, South
Grand Prairie's B.J. Johnson is the best high school football
player in Texas. Others have him rated as the best receiver in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he gave a commitment to play in college for the
University of Texas. Which, for what it's worth, ``didn't faze
Florida State, Notre Dame or Tennessee in the least,'' noted his
father, laughing. ``They all still call.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the Johnson household, there has always been a commitment
of another kind. That one was handed down to B.J. from his father
and mother, Stephanie (''the real backbone of the family,'' Willis
said.)
</P>
<P>
   These were parents who constantly stressed good grades and good
conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than anything we've been blessed as parents because B.J.
has strived to be a good kid,'' said Willis. ``He's not perfect,
far from it. But he's had the desire to do right.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've tried to give B.J. as parents is the same thing our
parents gave both of us when we were growing up in Gladewater. We
just passed it on.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the spotlight started to shine brightly on B.J. for his
football ability, Willis could also relate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this,'' he said. ``Notoriety can either kill you or
kiss you. And there's a fine line involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Willis does know. He's the longtime host of a popular morning
show on radio station KKDA-AM.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear from the critics, you hear from the fans,'' Willis
said. ``And with all that comes pressure and stress. B.J. is 17
years old, and every day he's picking up the paper and somebody is
saying something about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``And almost every night there for a while the most famous
college football coaches in the country were sitting in the same
chair in our living room. If you allow it to happen, all that can
change your perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm proud of B.J. I think he's handled it like a
champion.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Willis could see it coming, see that he and his wife
were the parents of someone especially gifted in football. ``But
really, it wasn't until the ninth grade that it started to hit home
for me,'' Willis said. ``I hear guys talking around town now about
how they saw it when B.J. was playing in the peewees. But who can
tell anything from peewees?''
</P>
<P>
   With football, however, also came Johnson house rule No. 1,
which started in grade school. There would be a B average in all
courses, or there would be no football.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once in the ninth grade, B.J. came close to a C-plus, but then
pulled that grade up to a B,'' said Willis. ``The coach was more
concerned than even I was _ he knew our rules. But thankfully, we
never had to enforce the house rule. There were always B's or
above.''
</P>
<P>
   As a sophomore playing for the SGP varsity, Willis got his first
hint that college coaches around the country would soon be
gathering in his living room.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was against Arlington Lamar and B.J. scored a couple of
touchdowns,'' he said. ``I'm thinking ``wow, this is Lamar. This is
Eddy Peach. This is the premier program around here. Is B.J. really
that good?' ''
</P>
<P>
   He was.
</P>
<P>
   But as always, there's the other side of the high school
football story. Every town in Texas knows this story. ``In middle
school, you could see a very good team coming for South Grand
Prairie,'' Willis said. ``It was a large and special group of
players. B.J. wasn't the best player, not even close.
</P>
<P>
   ``But a couple of those standouts, and one in particular, never
even made it through high school. Things happened in their lives
that changed everything. It is such a waste.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a parent, thinking about that is frightening. But thinking
about that also makes my wife and myself even more thankful.''

IN HARLEM, A CHESS MASTER PASSES ON HIS MOVES AND ENTHUSIASM
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On 119th Street in Harlem, chess is not a silent,
cerebral sport. The children bounce in their chairs, groan when
they are trapped and yell when they win or lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want those voices down to a whisper, or else!'' Maurice
Ashley commands, as the 6- and 7-year-olds at the Harlem Chess
Center set up their pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley, a Brooklyn resident, became a grandmaster last spring.
He is one of fewer than 500 in the world, and the first black to
reach the game's highest ranks. Unlike many of this country's top
players, who tend to concentrate on studying and practicing for
tournaments, Ashley, 34, has been teaching children chess for
years.
</P>
<P>
   The Harlem Chess Center, in the Police Athletic League building
on 119th Street, is ``my dream,'' said Ashley, who founded the
center. It opened in October as part of the Harlem Educational
Activities Fund, a nonprofit children's organization.
</P>
<P>
   Persuading children to learn chess may sound worthy but a little
dull _ unlike, for instance, teaching them acting or jump-shooting.
But the problems faced by Ashley and the four or five other
teachers at the chess center _ volunteers, college students and
staff members of the educational fund _ include calming down
overeager children and trying to accommodate the ones on the
waiting list because of a shortage of teachers and space.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who think the game is slow and boring should come in
here,'' he said. ``Kids eat it. Look _ jumping up and down,
tremendous energy. It takes nothing to get kids excited about
chess. I put the pieces down, and the kids want to touch them _
they're alluring, tactile. The game is magic for kids.''
</P>
<P>
   There are about 80 children, second-graders to 12th-graders, in
the Harlem Chess Center's after-school program.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 10 years, children's chess has exploded in
popularity. Instructors for the nonprofit Chess-in-the-Schools
programs teach the game at 161 public schools and 19 public
libraries throughout the city, mostly in poor neighborhoods, said
Allen Kaufman, executive director of the New York-based chess
group.

   Twenty-five years ago, 20 children competed in the first
national junior high chess championships. Last year more than 5,000
turned out for the junior high tournament in Knoxville, Tenn.
Studies show that chess increases children's reading and reasoning
skills, and improves harder-to-measure qualities like
self-confidence and sportsmanship, Kaufman said.
</P>
<P>
   The classes for younger children at the Harlem Chess Center
attract an equal number of boys and girls. Until the age of 10 or
so, the girls are at least as enthusiastic and a little more adept,
Ashley said, but in junior high, most lose interest. Ashley said he
had frequently seen junior high school-age boys mock and curse
girls who beat them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough thing to fight,'' he said. He is thinking about
starting girls-only classes for the higher grades at the Harlem
Chess Center.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ashley wanted to create a community chess center unconnected
with schools and classrooms _ a place where children could meet
their friends and play for fun, the way they go to a basketball
court for a few pickup games.
</P>
<P>
   One clear advantage the Harlem Chess Club has over school-based
ones is Ashley himself. After all, how many 7-year-olds get coached
by a grandmaster?
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got Maurice Ashley, and there are not many Maurice
Ashleys,'' Kaufman said. ``The typical grandmaster is an introvert
and spends his time studying and playing rather than teaching
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashley has been teaching with the Harlem Educational Activities
Fund for nine years, although he took a break two years ago while
training for the grandmaster tournaments and now teaches only a few
times a week.
</P>
<P>
   Moving rapidly between the little tables in the Harlem center,
he exudes energy and a passion for chess. His fascination with the
game is catching. He darts from child to child, pushing,
encouraging. ``Don't panic,'' he tells an 8-year-old boy yelling
``Aaahhh!'' after being trounced.
</P>
<P>
   At an adjacent table, Terrell Price and Antione Taylor,
6-year-olds from Public School 36 in Harlem who are just learning
the game, begin to shout. ``I took his bishop,'' cries Terrell,
knocking the piece off the board, ``and he took my queen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I took that queen out of the game,'' Antione says, lording it
over his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to move my bishop and take your pawn,'' Terrell
threatens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like this better than checkers,'' Antione says. ``But I like
Pokemon more.''

THE ERROR OF THE CENTURY FOR SOME WHO PAY SUPPORT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind.)   (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is a particularly ill-timed foul-up, given the jitters over
the new year's effects on computers: 97,000 New Jersey residents
have received notices that their child support and alimony payments
are overdue by about a century.
</P>
<P>
   But officials insisted Tuesday that the mistake was not an early
year 2000 problem _ just a garden-variety case of human error.
</P>
<P>
   Books of New Jersey family support coupons for January 2000 were
mailed out with due dates of January 1900, including some dated
Jan. 34, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The faulty date was computer related, to be sure. But officials
of the state, which has declared itself Y2K-ready, and the
Indianapolis company that prints and mails the coupons, said the
problem was caused by sloppy programming, followed by lax quality
control. And while the error involved the date change from 1999 to
2000, officials stressed that it was not the result of a
fundamental flaw in a computer operating system, and that it should
not be seized upon as a harbinger of other year 2000 problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a printing error,'' said Jackie Tencza, a spokeswoman
for the State Department of Human Services, which monitors the
480,000 child support payment arrangements by noncustodial parents
in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Allison Payment Systems Inc., will spend more than
$40,000 to mail letters of apology to the recipients, informing
them that the coupons should be used as if the dates were correct,
said Joseph H. Thomas, the company president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an embarrassment,'' said Thomas, whose company is paid by
volume, at 33 cents per mailing. ``Obviously, when you have as many
people as you do in our organization, there's going to be, from
time to time, somebody who makes a grievous error.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the Human Services Department's second computer-related
error this year to result in a faulty mass mailing. In March, $23
million in food stamps were sent out early to 140,000 recipients,
after a computer with insufficient memory failed to execute the
food stamp program properly, officials said. Officials at first
thought that the error had resulted from an attempt to fix a year
2000 problem.
</P>
<P>
   The state began testing its own computers for year 2000
readiness in January, and state contractors were required to
certify that they were ready, said Anna Thomas, a spokeswoman for
the State Office of Information Technology. On Dec. 8, Gov.
Christie Whitman declared the state ready for New Year's.
</P>
<P>
   In the child support mix-up, Thomas said his company had
received proper data on computer tape from the state for January's
mailing. In writing the program to convert the data from the
state's record-keeping format to the company's printing format, the
company programmer took into account the change in the last two
digits of the year, from 99 to 00. But, Thomas said, she failed to
account for the change in the first two digits, from 19 to 20. The
way the rest of the program was written allowed the date for the
last weekly payment of the month to be calculated as Jan. 34.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether any of the company's 175 employees would be
penalized, Thomas said, ``I'm a forgiving type person, I don't kill
people because they made a mistake.''

FOR HUFFINS, THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE LURKS WITHIN
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RON DICKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The question came from the students who were at the
Armory Track and Field Center in Upper Manhattan on Tuesday to meet
Chris Huffins, an American decathlon hopeful in the 2000 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does it take to win the gold medal?'' a student asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very fast, very strong and very powerful.'' Huffins said.
``But these are not enough for me to win the gold medal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn-born Huffins, the bronze medalist at the world
championships last summer, asked himself the same question when he
lost the 1997 national championships, despite the absence of Dan
O'Brien, the 1996 Olympic champion. He asked again during the 1997
world championships, when he fouled three times in the javelin and
threw his shoes into the trash before withdrawing.
</P>
<P>
   Huffins has inched toward the answer with recent success. He won
his first national championship in 1998, and this year he stood on
the medal podium in the world championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it took winning a medal to take myself out of the
potential category and into the kinetic category,'' said Huffins,
who was in Manhattan to promote Wednesday's Ultima 2000 Meet at the
Armory. A foot bruise will keep him from competing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically I challenged myself that in '99 if I didn't win a
medal, I was basically going to feel like a pretender and not a
contender,'' he said. ``I really would have questioned my
legitimate commitment. I think that test for myself was
necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Huffins' thoroughbred legs, long and explosive, have made him a
terror in the first five events of the 10-event competition: the
100 meters, for which Huffins holds the decathlon record of 10.22
seconds, the long jump, the shot-put, the high jump and the 400
meters. But Huffins has a reputation for falling off on the second
day, which includes the most technical event, the pole vault, and
the most grueling, the 1,500 meters.
</P>
<P>
   Huffins said the world championships were a breakthrough,
because he scored well below his average on the first day, and
still managed to finish third.
</P>
<P>
   And Huffins, who is 29, was glowing from his most recent
confidence builder. He said he had outperformed Tomas Dvorak of the
Czech Republic, the 1999 world champion and world record-holder
(8,994 points), during a 16-day training session in Australia.
Huffins, who is ranked fifth in the world and who has a career best
of 8,694 points, declared a psychological victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't anything I learned from him,'' Huffins said. ``It
was something I learned about myself training with him, and that is
that I am every bit as strong as he is. I had a better camp than he
did, and I got to him mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   Huffins said he had defeated Dvorak in games of one-upmanship
that included running and the hurdles, and throwing competitions.
</P>
<P>
   Huffins trains mainly in Winston-Salem, N.C., where he is the
sprint coach at Wake Forest and lives with his wife, Monique, and
their 6-month-old son, Zachary. Huffins considers his true home to
be the Bay Area, where he starred at the University of
California-Berkeley and hopes to coach someday.
</P>
<P>
   Huffins, who said he was obsessed with basketball as a boy,
lived in a brownstone in Bedford-Stuyvesant with his mother,
grandparents and uncle. His father, Christopher Huffins, a banking
executive and former basketball player at Adelphi, lived on Long
Island. Huffins said he had a strained relationship with his
father, and at the age of 16 told him he wanted a friend, not a
parental figure. ``Since then I could probably say he has never
disappointed me,'' he said. ``We are actually very close.''
</P>
<P>
   Huffins moved to Indianapolis with his mother in 1981. He
starred in the jumps and sprints in high school and then spent an
unsatisfying year at Purdue before transferring to Berkeley, where
he was introduced to the decathlon by the 1976 National Collegiate
Athletic Association decathlon champion, Ed Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Huffins, who finished 10th at the 1996 Olympics, said the Games
in Sydney next year would be his last. O'Brien still looms as a
threat, but no longer as a nemesis. ``That ended with my first
national championship in '98,'' Huffins said. ``In the Goodwill
Games, I actually for the first time ever expected to beat him. He
did beat me, but he had to have one hell of a track meet to do it.
And I felt that I had lost, whereas every time before it was, well,
he beat me again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those kinds of things had to happen to create a product that's
necessary to win in 2000.'' &QL;

DOLAN SEEN AS WINNING AS JETS BIDDING GOES ON
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS and MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The bidding for the New York Jets isn't over, but
Charles Dolan is expected to be announced in the next couple of
weeks as the new owner of the team, a person with knowledge of the
negotiations said Tuesday. Dolan, whose Cablevision owns two
basketball teams and a hockey team, is so eager to acquire the Jets
that he has agreed to pay $615 million, the person said.
</P>
<P>
   Dolan's bid exceeds the current offer of $600 million by Robert
Wood Johnson IV. However, another person involved in the
negotiations said Tuesday night that Johnson would submit a revised
bid Tuesday that would exceed $600 million.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, National Football League officials said there
was a chance that Johnson would outbid Dolan, but not a very likely
one.
</P>
<P>
   The $615 million price, one expert on the purchase of sports
teams said, is an enormous one to pay for a team that until this
year was a perennial loser financially. The Jets have projected a
profit of about $10 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   The person with knowledge of the negotiations said it seemed
apparent as the sale proceeded that the strategy of Goldman, Sachs
&AMP; Co., the investment-banking concern conducting the sale, was to
use the interest of Johnson _ who is an heir to the Johnson &AMP;
Johnson fortune _ as a way to induce Dolan to raise his bid. That
strategy may still be at work in Johnson's new bid Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Dolan, 73, who unsuccessfully bid for the Washington Redskins
and expansion Cleveland Browns, has had to deal with another hurdle
in his quest of owning an NFL team. Although the league said this
month that its finance committee would wait until the estate of
Leon Hess, the late owner, made its decision on a buyer before
reviewing the prospective owner, league officials have already been
dealing with the ownership issue that Dolan would present.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL bars corporate ownership of its teams because of the
concern that a large corporation would have endless economic
resources with which to operate. Dolan is buying the team as an
individual, but the league wants to put controls in place that
would ensure that his ownership of the Jets remains separate from
Cablevision. One person described those talks as being difficult.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of Cablevision, Dolan has a stable of teams that
include the Knicks, the Rangers and the Liberty of the Women's
National Basketball Association and other enterprises that include
Madison Square Garden and the MSG cable network. Dolan has also
been negotiating to buy the Mets. An announcement about the
baseball team had been expected by the end of the year, but nothing
has been forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   If Dolan takes over the Jets, he is expected to try to increase
the team's revenue by getting a new stadium. The Jets' lease at
Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., runs through 2008 and
severely limits the Jets' income. Although some people believe
Dolan would like to return the Jets to New York, one friend said
Tuesday that he would be happy to have the team play anywhere in
the metropolitan region where he could obtain a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Dolan, in the estimation of league officials, is also expected
to be a hands-off owner in the manner of Hess. Thus, as Jets Coach
Bill Parcells continues to weigh his decision on whether to remain
as the team's coach and general manager, the fact that he may soon
have a new owner unlikely to prowl the sideline may sway him toward
remaining at least one more season.
</P>
<P>
   As for when a new Jets owner might be named, NFL owners will
gather in New York for a special meeting on Jan. 18, at which time
they are expected to address the Jets situation. It is quite
possible they will vote to approve a new owner at the meeting,
based on a recommendation from the finance committee. &QL;

BOWING TO Y2K CONCERNS, INTERNATIONAL DEBUTANTE BALL CANCELED   
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MONIQUE P. YAZIGI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Even young women in fluffy white dresses have been
affected by Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in its 45 years, the International Debutante
Ball, the cotillion where the daughters of Eisenhowers, Nixons and
Forbeses have been presented to society in the grand ballroom at
the Waldorf-Astoria, has been canceled. There will be no curtsies,
no military escorts and no dancing to the wee hours of the night to
the Lester Lanin Band.
</P>
<P>
   The event, traditionally held just days before the New Year, is
one of the best known debutante balls, recognized for mixing
European royalty with oil money from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nervous to cancel it,'' said Margaret Hedberg, the
director of the international ball, whose aunt founded it in 1954.
``No one has ever done such a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's what happened. Back in March, when Ms. Hedberg sent out
the pink and silver engraved invitations to a group of 250 young
women between the ages of 17 and 21 (preselected by a committee
headed by Susan Eisenhower, the granddaughter of Dwight D.
Eisenhower), the response came back mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the families sent in the required $800 deposit (toward
the $5,000 fee), but many sent in a note asking to secure a spot
for next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The millennium split my list,'' Ms. Hedberg said. By June,
even the families who said yes were canceling, saying they were
worried about being in New York for New Year's. They were concerned
about getting hotel rooms (families generally attend with at least
20 friends), flying and getting theater reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Because while the actual party is held on Dec. 29, the ball
itself is only one part of a slew of events. Besides all the dress
fittings and Bachrach sittings, families of the women, who come to
New York from as far away as California and Europe, traditionally
spend the entire week in the city, throwing teas, attending
black-tie pre-parties, going to bachelor breakfasts and seeing
musicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, they wouldn't have been able to have the run of the
city like they usually do, and who knows what's going to happen,''
Ms. Hedberg said.
</P>
<P>
   So, Ms. Hedberg called all the families at the end of June to
cancel.
</P>
<P>
   Upon hearing the news, one father from Tennessee, Ms. Hedberg
recalls, told her he thought his wife and daughter were plain crazy
for even thinking about attending the event this year.
</P>
<P>
   All is not lost. Ms. Hedberg said the young women have
alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it's OK,'' she said. ``It's OK because some have already
come out in Texas or in their own hometown.''
</P>
<P>
   If the thought of coming out in Texas is alluring, there are
other advantages, she added: ``This gives the girls another year to
diet, to fit into their dresses.''

NETS SHOW THE KNICKS THAT THEY'RE FOR REAL
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The prevailing feeling before the Nets
and the Knicks tipped off Tuesday night at Continental Arena was
that the luster of this potentially scintillating matchup between
geographic rivals had been lost.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets, looking to validate their resurgence against the
defending Eastern Conference champions, found out before the game
that Keith Van Horn would not play because of the flu. And the
Knicks, already missing the suspended Kurt Thomas, were without
Marcus Camby (sprained left ankle) and Charlie Ward (flu).
</P>
<P>
   With such absences weakening and transforming the teams, what
could be learned about the Nets and their apparent resurgence in
what seemed destined to be a big loss without their main frontcourt
scorer?
</P>
<P>
   But while Van Horn recuperated at his home in Franklin Lakes,
N.J., the Nets taught a lesson in heart. Winners of nine of their
last 12 games, they are for real. Forced to start 6-foot-7-inch
Scott Burrell, a natural small forward, at power forward, the Nets
(11-18) used quickness, execution and dogged resolve to beat the
Knicks, 89-83, and end a four-game losing streak to their bigger,
badder neighborhood rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall Gill led the Nets with a season-high 23 points. He also
had seven rebounds and two blocked shots, including one on Ewing
that set the Nets' defensive tone in the first few minutes. Kerry
Kittles, sinking jumpers and zooming around the court defensively,
followed with 21 points, and Stephon Marbury added 16 points and 13
assists. Jamie Feick grabbed 17 rebounds, one more than Ewing (9
points).
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks, who lost their second straight game in dropping to
17-11, shot woefully. Neither Latrell Sprewell (4 for 16, 8
points), Allan Houston (6 for 17, 19 points) nor Ewing (3 for 12)
could find the range, leaving John Wallace to lead the Knicks with
20 points.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere in only the second sellout crowd in the
Meadowlands this season _ the first was when the Knicks won, 92-82,
on Dec. 4 _ was intense, unlike any Nets game this season. And the
Nets, who with eight straight home victories are one shy of the
franchise record, responded accordingly. Displeased to hear fans
cheering for the Knicks in their building, the Nets were set on
protecting their home court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't allow anyone to come into our house and steal
anything, so we have to go out on the court, especially at home,
and act like we're protecting our home,'' Marbury had said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets led, 45-44, at the half and increased the margin to 9
(70-61) by shooting 56.3 percent in the third quarter. Marbury, who
led the Nets with dishing and defense in the first half, scored 10
points in the third.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks, who used their big backcourt of Sprewell and Houston
for most of the first half because Chris Childs was in foul
trouble, rallied several times in the third, but the Nets held them
off. Gill put the Nets up, 81-73, with a 20 footer, and Kittles
pushed the lead to 10 with a 17-foot runner with 3 minutes 50
seconds left. When Gill made one of two foul shots to make it
84-73, then followed a Wallace basket with a jumper from the corner
at the 2:10 mark, the game seemed to be over. But Ewing scored and
then Larry Johnson hit a 3-pointer to again pull the Knicks within
6 points with just over a minute left. The Nets, however, were able
to hold on.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell was hot early, hitting three jumpers to lead the Knicks
to a 14-7 lead, but the Nets answered with a 9-0 run that put them
ahead and prompted Van Gundy to call a timeout. Marbury waved his
arms in an attempt to get the crowd charged while walking to the
bench.
</P>
<P>
   Without Van Horn, Casey had concerns about whether Marbury would
try to take too much offense upon his shoulders. The last time Van
Horn missed a game, a preseason contest against Cleveland, Marbury
put up 30 shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to have to step my game up,'' Marbury said before
the game. ``Everybody has to. I'm not going to do anything I
haven't been doing to help my team win. If Keith doesn't play, it's
definitely going to make things different.''
</P>
<P>
   There were times early when Marbury, who as a Brooklyn native
naturally gets pumped up for the Knicks, seemed to press. He had
three turnovers in the first five minutes and air-balled a
3-pointer late in the quarter. But, as he has done during the Nets'
period of improvement, he sparked them in other areas.
</P>
<P>
   He ran the offense nicely to offset his 2-of-9 shooting and
recorded nine assists and three steals in the first half. His final
feed of the half came on a 3-pointer by Gill that beat the buzzer
and sent the Nets into the locker room with a 45-44 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets' lead was a testament to their defense, which was
highlighted by aggressive traps and flicking hands and the
surprisingly strong presence that Jim McIlvaine provided inside.
McIlvaine, playing with flu-like symptoms, had his best game of the
season, neutralizing Ewing and blocking three shots in the first
half alone. Such strong defense enabled the Nets to overcome a 5-
minute-38-second second-quarter drought in which they went without
a field goal and fell behind, 32-27. But the reserve guard Lucious
Harris hit three straight baskets, including a 3-pointer, to put
the Nets back in front.

I STARE DEATH IN THE FACE  (rk)

<P>
   DEATH-ROW INVESTIGATOR
</P>
<P>
   Caryn Platt Tatelli, 29, grew up in Silicon Valley, the daughter
of Lewis E. Platt, the outgoing Hewlett-Packard chairman. Working
like a consultant, she is hired by lawyers and in most cases
conducts prison interviews and searches some of the Midwest's most
violent neighborhoods for mitigating factors to save inmates from
execution.
</P>
<P>
   As far as I can remember, I was fascinated with true-crime
books. As soon as I realized there was a career in understanding
why people commit murder, I knew that is what I wanted to do.
</P>
<P>
   I have been doing mitigation since 1993. The thing that amazes
me is meeting a person who is charged with a horrible offense, and
they almost always seem very human. My job is to find the hurt,
vulnerable, sad or angry side of the person, and to argue that they
need help, not execution. I gather all the factors and try to
understand why my clients were in a gang, why they participated in
a murder, why their sexual deviance made them kill someone.
</P>
<P>
   There are nearly 400 people on death row just in Illinois. I
have about 20 cases at the moment, all over the Midwest. I work on
my own. I charge $60 an hour for state cases, $70 for federal, but
because the money comes from the public defender's budget, the
judge sometimes caps my income. The hardest part is I don't get
paid until the case is closed, and some cases have gone on since
1995. One case I have already spent over 1,000 hours on. I am owed
about $60,000.
</P>
<P>
   Some days are very, very difficult. Some of the worst housing
projects I know like the back of my hand. I am white and most of my
clients are black or Hispanic. Last year, I was on death row in
Pontiac, Mich., the day after an execution, and everyone was
grieving; even the guards were so sad. I also do a lot of work in
very, very bad neighborhoods. Often I send out my bill and think, I
don't know that this compensates me for what it has taken out of me
emotionally.
</P>
<P>
   I would not say I am against the death penalty. But until we
have a fairer way of dealing out death sentences, I don't think
there is enough caution. Sometimes, my findings have influenced the
fate of a defendant. In one recent case in Decatur, Ill. _ a gang
fight that went bad and resulted in a shooting death _ the jury
recommended against sentencing the killer to death, partly because
of the testimony of a former teacher I found.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of times I have felt really threatened. My first-ever
client started talking to me about how he could easily overpower
me. Another client who is very disturbed and paranoid, with icy
blue eyes, had staring contests with me. I am about the same age as
most of my clients, so they are very curious about the differences
in our lives. I tell them up-front that I am married, that I have
two dogs and we are renovating an old house in Chicago. That makes
them open up about their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   People ask whether I worry about burning out. I don't. I would
rather give 100 percent for 20 years than 50 percent until I
retire. A part of me would like to do interior decorating. Another
part wants to do active parenting. Right now, this is what I love.

LAWRENCE MAJEWSKI, EXPERT IN FINE ARTS CONSERVATION, DIES AT 80  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lawrence J. Majewski, an internationally known art conservation
expert who headed an American team of conservators in Florence,
Italy, after flooding there in 1966, died on Dec. 2 his home in
Wappingers Falls, N.Y. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was leukemia, said Prof. Margaret Holben Ellis,
chairman of the New York University Institute of Fine Arts
Conservation Center.
</P>
<P>
   Majewski was the center's chairman in 1972, when he and three
other experts jointly affirmed a dramatic reappraisal of the
Metropolitan Museum of Art's famous bronze horse, which had been
deemed inauthentic in 1967 after being known as ``one of the finest
bronzes of classical Greece.''
</P>
<P>
   He retired in 1986 as chairman and as Hagop Kevorkian professor
of art conservation at the center in Manhattan. Last month he
received the Conservation and Heritage Management Award of the
Archaeological Institute of America for accomplishments that
included organizing and leading a group of 17 American conservators
who worked in Florence after the flood.
</P>
<P>
   The group's journey was seen as a fact-finding mission, but its
members also plunged into the rescue efforts in the most physical
way. ``They assisted in moving artworks into dry areas where
possible,'' Ellis recalled. The group also helped rescue sodden
books.
</P>
<P>
   Majewski and his three fellow experts declared in 1972 that the
Metropolitan's bronze horse, which the museum's vice director for
operations, Joseph Noble, had called a 20th-century fraud and
forgery in 1967, was in fact an ``irrefutably genuine work of
antiquity.'' Their finding still stands, Ellis said .
</P>
<P>
   Born in Mason City, Iowa, Majewski earned bachelor's and
master's degrees in fine arts at Yale University and worked at the
Metropolitan Museum and in Turkey before joining the center's staff
in 1960. He became chairman in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his companion, Dewey Owens, and a brother,
Andrew, of Plymouth, Iowa.

INFLATED PRICES DAMPEN NEW YEAR'S EVE CELEBRATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Also being filed in ``t'' category.)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Seattle officials attributed Tuesday's cancellation of most of
the city's New Year's Eve celebration to the possibility of
terrorist acts, a possibility that no longer seemed quite so
far-fetched after the arrest in Washington state two weeks ago of
an Algerian man who has been charged with smuggling explosives from
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, concerns about terrorism and possible Year 2000
problems have caused many Americans to cancel airline and hotel
reservations for this week's holiday, or caused them to stay away
from airlines, hotels or crowds in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   But so far the biggest dampener on celebrations has proved to be
the highly inflated price tags for the parties and entertainment
packages. And since midnight this Friday will not usher in the real
millennium, which will not arrive until the stroke of 2001, the
question is what, if anything, tour packagers, hotels, cruise ships
and the like plan for next year.
</P>
<P>
   To hear them talk, the answer is ``smaller events,'' ``lower
prices'' and ``less hype.'' But don't bet on it. Even assuming a
safe and disaster-free celebration this New Year's Eve, and no
computer problems to worry about next year, there remains a full
year for the spinmeisters to beat the drums for the absolutely,
positively, all-new millennium. Didn't P.T. Barnum, who should
know, have something to say about human gullibility?
</P>
<P>
   This is not to suggest that New York and other big cities will
resemble ghost towns come Friday. On the contrary, most still
expect swarms of visitors and locals.
</P>
<P>
   The Marriott Marquis in Times Square _ which received its first
reservation for this New Year's Eve back in 1983, two years before
it even opened _ has had a few inquiries about reservations for
next New Year's Eve. (It won't accept any reservations for next New
Year's Eve before Jan. 16.) And in contrast to the early clamor for
hotel and cruise ship reservations for this New Year's Eve _ which
resulted in hotels and cruise ships writing reservations in ledger
books because their computers did not accept reservations more than
a year in advance _ none of the hotels or cruise ships surveyed
about their plans for welcoming in 2001 have anything approaching a
waiting list.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many of the eager beavers who booked reservations for
this New Year's Eve as early as 1998, before the rates for parties
and cruises were established, were among the first to cancel when
it came time to put down a deposit. Among the exceptions are Ed
Woodyard, a New York resident who made that reservation at the
Marquis back in 1983 and is scheduled to be there on Friday, and an
Oregon family that four years ago booked the restaurant in the
Space Needle in Seattle and will be allowed up there on Friday even
though the park below the Space Needle will be locked at 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Most New York hotels expect to be full or close to it over this
weekend, and presumably again this time next year. But if so, that
will be largely because New York hotels, at least the better ones,
usually fill up on New Year's Eve. But to insure that they will be
full, many hotels reduced their four-night minimum stays, slashed
their room rates and turned many rooms over to discount reservation
services. And three hotels _ the Millennium Broadway, Fitzpatrick
Grand Hotel and Fitzpatrick Manhattan _ that offered to rent their
buildings and staff over New Year's Eve for $1 million to $3
million did not receive any takers.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Holiday Inn Wall Street has sold out all
138 rooms to seven corporations, including J.P. Morgan, Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter, Credit Suisse and Merrill Lynch. The
companies, which paid $1,350 a room for a three-day stay, will be
monitoring their mainframes for any possible Year 2000 problems.
</P>
<P>
   It is already apparent that despite a roaring economy and the
mantra that ``the millennium only comes once every thousand
years,'' the public from Boston to Los Angeles and from London to
Sydney has balked at high-priced packages.
</P>
<P>
   By midsummer, Minneapolis-St. Paul had canceled its ``biggest
New Year's Eve party ever'' for lack of corporate sponsors. Cruise
lines began discounting their high-priced millennium cruises. The
Celebration 2000 party scheduled for the Jacob Javits Convention
Center in Manhattan (at $1,000 to $2,500 a person) cut prices but
still had to cancel for lack of interest.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the $10,000-a-person package that included a
flight on the Concorde to welcome in the year 2000 in Paris and New
York was canceled after only four people had signed up. America's
New Millennium celebration in Washington, with tickets ranging up
to $2,000, was called off two weeks ago for lack of interest. Tour
operators in London recently began discounting some package tours
as much as 80 percent. And from Philadelphia to Phoenix, sales for
many big-ticket celebrations have lagged badly behind.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a lesson in all this? No doubt, but we can only wait
and see what next New Year's Eve brings in the way of parties and
prices.

EDITORIAL: NEW YEAR'S EVE SECURITY ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Dec. 29:
</P>
<P>
   Anxiety about terrorism and other forms of mayhem is rising as
cities around the country prepare for the millennial New Year's Eve
celebration. New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Police
Commissioner Howard Safir are taking the wise approach of ordering
tough security measures without allowing the fear of terrorism to
prevent New Yorkers _ and millions who will be watching the events
on television _ from enjoying the traditional Times Square
festivities.
</P>
<P>
   Other cities may take different approaches, depending on their
resources and assessment of local risks. Seattle, for example, has
announced that it will cancel a city-sponsored New Year's Eve
celebration that was expected to draw about 50,000 people to the
Seattle Center. That decision was made partly because the city is
still recovering from the violence that erupted during the World
Trade Organization meeting earlier this month. No terrorist threats
have been made against Seattle, but city officials say they cannot
rule out a reappearance of anarchist-connected groups that set off
the WTO violence. Another reason for concern is the arrest two
weeks ago of an Algerian man charged with illegally carrying
bomb-making materials from Canada into Washington state. An arrest
warrant has been issued for a second man who is thought to be
linked to the jailed suspect.
</P>
<P>
   The scale of New York City's celebration, which may draw up to
two million people, demands aggressive security tactics even though
there is no information suggesting that New York is a terrorism
target. Eight thousand police officers will be assigned to the
blocks around Times Square. A mile-long, three-block-wide stretch
of midtown will be closed to traffic, and all parked cars will be
towed to prevent car bombs. Bomb-sniffing dogs will patrol
underground tunnels. Manhole covers will be welded shut, and all
garbage cans removed from the surrounding blocks, again to
eliminate places bombs might be hidden. Police helicopters will be
used for surveillance overhead, officers will be placed on roofs,
and all streets leading into Times Square will be tightly
controlled, with officers checking people for alcohol, weapons and
any suspicious activities. The entire Port Authority police force
of 1,250 officers will also be deployed.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, Times Square is jammed on New Year's Eve. As
Giuliani pointed out, there are no absolute guarantees against risk
anywhere in the world. But the best way to deter terrorists is with
well-publicized plans that make it hard for them to target an area.
The city's security plan meets that standard by being smart,
focused and detailed.

DOLAN SEEN AS WINNING AS JETS BIDDING GOES ON
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: SUBS 4th graf, The $615 million ..., to fix to operating
profit of $11.5 million, sted $10 million.) 
(nk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS and MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The bidding for the New York Jets isn't over, but
Charles Dolan is expected to be announced in the next couple of
weeks as the team's new owner, a person with knowledge of the
negotiations said Tuesday. Dolan, whose Cablevision owns two
basketball teams and a hockey team, is so eager to acquire the Jets
that he has agreed to pay $615 million, the person said.
</P>
<P>
   Dolan's bid exceeds the current offer of $600 million by Robert
Wood Johnson IV. However, another person involved in the
negotiations said Tuesday night that Johnson would submit a revised
bid Tuesday that would exceed $600 million.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, National Football League officials said there
was a chance that Johnson would outbid Dolan, but not a very likely
one.
</P>
<P>
   The $615 million price, one expert on the purchase of teams
said, is an enormous one to pay for a team that until this year was
a perennial loser financially. The Jets have projected an operating
profit of about $11.5 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   The person with knowledge of the negotiations said it seemed
apparent as the sale proceeded that the strategy of Goldman, Sachs
&AMP; Co., the investment-banking concern conducting the sale, was to
use the interest of Johnson _ who is an heir to the Johnson &AMP;
Johnson fortune _ as a way to induce Dolan to raise his bid. That
strategy may still be at work in Johnson's new bid Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Dolan, 73, who unsuccessfully bid for the Washington Redskins
and expansion Cleveland Browns, has had to deal with another hurdle
in his quest of owning an NFL team. Although the league said this
month that its finance committee would wait until the estate of
Leon Hess, the late owner, made its decision on a buyer before
reviewing the prospective owner, league officials have already been
dealing with the ownership issue that Dolan would present.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL bars corporate ownership of its teams because of the
concern that a large corporation would have endless economic
resources with which to operate. Dolan is buying the team as an
individual, but the league wants to put controls in place that
would ensure that his ownership of the Jets remains separate from
Cablevision. One person described those talks as being difficult.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of Cablevision, Dolan has a stable of teams that
include the Knicks, the Rangers and the Liberty of the Women's
National Basketball Association and other enterprises that include
Madison Square Garden and the MSG cable network. Dolan has also
been negotiating to buy the Mets. An announcement about the
baseball team had been expected by the end of the year, but nothing
has been forthcoming.

<P>
   If Dolan takes over the Jets, he is expected to try to increase
the team's revenue by getting a new stadium. The Jets' lease at
Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., runs through 2008 and
severely limits the Jets' income. Although some people believe
Dolan would like to return the Jets to New York, one friend said
Tuesday that he would be happy to have the team play anywhere in
the metropolitan region where he could obtain a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Dolan, in the estimation of league officials, is also expected
to be a hands-off owner in the manner of Hess. Thus, as Jets Coach
Bill Parcells continues to weigh his decision on whether to remain,
the fact that he may soon have a new owner unlikely to prowl the
sideline may sway him toward remaining at least one more season.
</P>
<P>
   As for when a new Jets owner might be named, NFL owners will
gather in New York for a special meeting on Jan. 18, at which time
they are expected to address the Jets situation. It is quite
possible they will vote to approve a new owner at the meeting,
based on a recommendation from the finance committee. &QL;

EDITORIAL: A DELICATE TIME FOR THE SCHOOLS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Dec. 29:
</P>
<P>
   The New York City Board of Education made the sensible move
Tuesday when it voted to buy out the remainder of Schools
Chancellor Rudy Crew's contract, with the aim of installing an
interim chancellor by the middle of next month. But after forcing
out one of the most popular chancellors in recent memory at the
behest of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, the board bears a heavy
responsibility not to politicize the search for a successor. A
replacement who is perceived as a political ideologue _ or a puppet
of the mayor _ could easily poison the administrative process,
undermining school reforms that have been agreed upon in principle
but not yet instituted.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has suggested that the next chancellor should be a
skilled administrator and manager, who might come from the field of
education but need not. That emphasizes the key criterion _ an
ability to run a complex organization. The school system already
has its educational road map in place _ in the new standards set by
the state Board of Regents and in the reforms instituted by Crew.
Now it needs a strong manager to drive it to success, someone who
can ensure stability and quell the turmoil that has roiled the
system.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most pressing issues is the new social promotion
policy, which requires children who fail math and reading exams to
attend summer school. The program encountered problems last summer
and is scheduled to expand greatly this summer. But the board has
yet to negotiate contract changes with the teachers' union that
would allow the summer session to be fully staffed.
</P>
<P>
   Several other initiatives could fall apart without close
attention from Crew's successor. Among them are the new principals'
contract, the school-based governance structure and preparation for
the graduation requirements recently mandated by the Regents. Also,
about a third of New York's teachers could retire in the next five
years, creating an alarming teacher shortage.
</P>
<P>
   After installing a nondivisive interim leader for the system,
the board should cast the widest possible net to find a new
chancellor. The search will be difficult given that New York has
burned off seven chancellors in 15 years, many of them sacrificed
to partisan politics. But what the system needs now is a
nonpartisan administrator who can push the pending reforms to
fruition and take the system on to the next level of improvement.

SOLUTION FOR FEARS OF PUBLIC SPEAKING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Dave McNary 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES -- Let's say you're at your desk late Friday,
already planning your weekend, when the boss casually mentions that
he needs you to make a 20-minute presentation next week at a
conference panel.
</P>
<P>
   It's understandable if your weekend is now ruined as your
stomach knots up at the prospect, according to Malcolm Kushner,
author of ``Public Speaking for Dummies'' and a longtime corporate
humor consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is already the most stressful time of year, what with
shopping and getting together with families,'' Kushner said.
``People often have to get up and say a few words at events, so the
combined stress level can go through the roof.''
</P>
<P>
   So, aside from moving to Bolivia, what's to be done? According
to Kushner, the best way to alleviate your fears is through
preparation, even though many people shun that advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would be amazed at how many people simply try to wing it
when they're called upon to do public speaking,'' Kushner marvels.
``With anything else, like driving a car or going in for a job
interview, they never would even think about flying by the seat of
their pants. But when it comes to public speaking, people are too
lazy to do the preparation.''
</P>
<P>
   As a first step to boost confidence and give insight into
delivery techniques, Kushner recommends simply listening to others
make speeches and participate in panel discussions through Internet
sites such as www.refdesk.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not exactly rocket science,'' he noted. ``Someone like
(Sun MicroSysems Chief Executive Officer) Scott MacNealy has a very
off-the-cuff sound. I think it's reassuring to listen to famous
people make speeches because you realize that they're not that
great.''
</P>
<P>
   More important, though, is to puzzle through why you've been
asked to give a speech. Then do the research you need to find
something unique to say to that particular audience, such as a
particular name, place or event that they all know.
</P>
<P>
   ``People love that kind of stuff even if it makes no sense to an
outsider,'' he said. ``It communicates that you've done the
research and it compliments the audience. Say the right name, one
that has meaning to the audience, and it's almost magic.''
</P>
<P>
   How about a joke? That's a minefield, according to Stanley Myron
Handelman, a Woodland Hills resident who has performed stand-up
comedy for five decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Humor is the most likable trait that a person can have because
it puts people at ease,'' he noted. ``But if it's not funny, it's
not humor, so the downside is it can make everyone uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   So the humor has to somehow relate to the topic at hand and be
delivered by a speaker who is confident. ``Once you've done that,
it makes you relax and it makes the audience relax and they don't
feel like you're pushing anything on them,'' Handelman said.
</P>
<P>
   Kushner agrees that jokes can work as long as they have a point,
a technique used effectively by politicians such as Ronald Reagan.
``Reagan uses classic old jokes and the connection seems tenuous
but he's a real pro, so that even if you don't think it's funny, it
still makes sense,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At a fund-raiser, for example, Reagan told a story about three
grown sons who, when asked by their parents for financial help,
offered excuses as to why they couldn't. The parents say, ``We
never even got married because we couldn't afford it, so you know
what that makes you. And cheap ones too.''
</P>
<P>
   Reagan then said, ``I'm glad that none of you are like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kushner will speak on Feb. 21 at the annual Presidents Day
celebration at the Reagan library in Simi Valley. His topic is
``Leading with Laughter: How U.S. Presidents Use Humor to Relate,
Motivate and Communicate.''

500 PEOPLE EVACUATED AS FIRE BURNS IN CALIFORNIA HILLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: SUBS 2nd graf to update, residents told they can return to
their homes.) 
(DW) 
 By BARBARA WHITAKER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ More than 500 people were evacuated early Tuesday
from their homes in Arcadia, 22 miles east of here, as a fire in
the Angeles National Forest burned out of control in the mountains
above town.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday night, fire officials told residents they could
return to their homes. The officials said they had contained about
40 percent of the blaze, which had destroyed at least 750 acres in
the San Gabriel Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   No homes were destroyed in the fire, which began about 2:45 p.m.
Monday in Santa Anita Canyon. Three of the nearly 1,000
firefighters attacking the blaze sustained minor injuries,
officials reported. Otherwise, no one was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Ketman, a spokesman for the U.S. Forest Service, said
efforts to fight the fire had been hampered by ``very, very steep
terrain.''
</P>
<P>
   Ketman said there had not been a fire in the area since 1969, so
there was plenty of vegetation to fuel the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   Although the high fire season typically ends in November, dry
weather has turned much of the region into a tinderbox, Ketman
said. Those conditions fueled a fire on Monday in Trabuco Canyon
near Mission Viejo, which burned 60 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a fire in the Los Padres National Forest in Ojai in
Ventura County burned more than 4,300 acres and destroyed a home.
Another fire last week in the La Canada-Flintridge and Glendale
area, north of downtown Los Angeles, destroyed 524 acres and
threatened homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just haven't had any rain this year,'' Ketman said.
</P>
<P>
   Three helicopters and four tanker planes were being used to
fight the Arcadia fire. While the authorities said they were in a
good position to keep the fire from houses, the big unknown factor
was the wind. High Santa Ana winds that blow in off the desert can
play havoc with efforts to contain a fire.
</P>
<P>
   As the fire grows, Ketman said, it can begin to produce its own
``weather,'' generating updrafts that keep it moving.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Okun, a volunteer with the San Gabriel Red Cross, said
that about 100 residents checked in at the Arcadia Community Center
on Monday night but that many moved on to stay with friends or
relatives. Only about 30 adults and 10 children remained at the
center this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Genevieve A. Green, a 28-year resident who left her home in the
mountains about 7:30 p.m. Monday, said she had no idea when she
would be allowed to return home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on the weather,'' Mrs. Green said early Tuesday by
telephone from the Arcadia Community Center, where the Red Cross
set up a temporary shelter. ``If a Santa Ana comes up, we're stuck
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Green said that she and her husband had seen the fire on
Monday as they returned home from the holidays but that officials
had told them not to worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went and took a nap,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But by 7:30, the police were at the door telling residents that
they should leave. At that point, Mrs. Green said, she looked
toward her backyard and could see ``a total wall of flames'' moving
toward her house.
</P>
<P>
   By 10 p.m., officials had begun forced evacuations. ``We
gathered all of our children's pictures and put them in the car,''
Mrs. Green said. ``It was very frightening.''

EDITORIAL: ANOTHER DESTRUCTIVE COUP
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Dec. 29:
</P>
<P>
   The news out of Ivory Coast this week may seem all too familiar
for a West African nation: an armed forces mutiny, widespread
looting, the armed seizure of radio and television stations, and
finally the announcement of a coup by soldiers who say they are
promoting national ``salvation.'' On Sunday the ousted president,
Henri Konan Bedie, was airlifted to neighboring Togo and may seek
asylum in France.
</P>
<P>
   But this not just another African coup. Ivory Coast has long
been regarded as one of the most stable and prosperous countries in
Africa. It is the world's largest producer of cocoa, with good
roads and a modern capital, Abidjan, with glass-and-steel office
towers and a cosmopolitan middle class. It has been a friend to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the coup has exposed the illusory nature of stability in
countries where even the best-intentioned leaders have relied on
coercion and patronage to secure their power and where democracy
and accountability are extremely fragile. After independence from
France in 1960, Ivory Coast was dominated for more than three
decades by Felix Houphouet-Boigny, who presided over rapid economic
growth and skillfully balanced the interests of regional groups,
but failed to lay a firm institutional foundation that could
withstand the ambitions of a less nimble successor.
</P>
<P>
   Bedie, who took office when Houphouet-Boigny died in 1993,
oversaw a steadily more corrupt and repressive regime. His fate may
have been sealed in 1995 when he won a full five-year term in
balloting sullied by government rules that eliminated the
president's strongest rivals. His security forces bullied opponents
and the press, creating a groundswell of ill will. The country is
now being run by a nine-man junta. Its leader is Gen. Robert Guei,
a former chief of staff of the armed forces who has said he will
create a government that will include civilians _ but has not said
when.
</P>
<P>
   France is the real power to reckon with in Ivory Coast. The
French too often acquiesced in Bedie's transgressions for their own
strategic and commercial reasons. Nevertheless, both France and the
United States have rightly condemned this armed seizure of power,
as did Nigeria and South Africa, the two most powerful countries in
sub-Saharan Africa. They should insist that the soldiers promptly
set a date certain when they will hand the country over to genuine
democratic rule.

EDITORIAL: EQUALITY ON THE GOLF COURSE

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Dec. 29
</P>
<P>
   In a case rattling clubs around the country, women who are
members of the Haverhill Golf and Country Club in Massachusetts
have won a stunning jury verdict of $1.9 million in damages for
being systematically denied full memberships and equal access to
the golf course in prime playing times. The award, and the prospect
that the court might now take control of the club, is sure to make
clubs around the country review their policies.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Haverhill club no longer discriminated by race or
religion, women remained an inferior class. At golf clubs, where
business is often conducted, what matters most is who gets to be a
member, and who gets to play when. When husbands worked and wives
stayed home, women could be limited members and play golf on
weekdays. Prime weekend tee-off times were restricted to men. But
gender habits changed, and a decade ago a group of women complained
to the state Commission Against Discrimination that they were being
barred from full membership at Haverhill by the club's written
rules. The club changed its rules but apparently not its practices.
In 1995 nine more women filed suit, charging that they were being
denied full memberships and course privileges.
</P>
<P>
   Such complaints are now pending in New York, Pennsylvania and
Ohio. Private clubs like Haverhill, which advertise themselves,
rent their facilities directly to the public and let in almost
anyone who applies, cannot violate public laws against
discrimination. But the club officers chose to fight the suit in
court.
</P>
<P>
   After testimony that the club had manipulated and destroyed
waiting lists to deny women equal access, and suspended or
threatened women who complained, the jury's verdict was unanimous.
Superior Court Judge John C. Cratsley is now considering a motion
from the state attorney general that a monitor be appointed to run
the club for the next five years, and that all its board members,
committee heads and employees undergo sensitivity training about
the state's laws against discriminating by gender. Courts have done
that with school and prison systems. This would be the first club.
But Cratsley should so rule, if he thinks that is what it takes.

ADDING STILL MORE BRICKS TO `PINK FLOYD THE WALL'

   (For release Sunday, Jan. 2)

<P>
   In one of the strangest cinematic collaborations ever, Pink
Floyd lyricist Roger Waters, animator Gerald Scarfe and film
director Alan Parker famously butted heads during the making of
``Pink Floyd The Wall,'' the 1982 film adaptation of the British
group's best-selling 1979 album ``The Wall,'' about the alienation
and mental breakdown of a burnt-out rock star.
</P>
<P>
   The newly released 94-minute DVD (Columbia Music Video, $29.99)
includes an accompanying documentary, ``Retrospective,'' in which
the principals look back nearly two decades, bemused at the most
unpleasant shoot.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, the movie that resulted is as schizophrenic as
its protagonist, thrown off-balance by the disparate efforts of its
creative trio.
</P>
<P>
   Scarfe's daringly original animated sequences _ first used at
the concerts Pink Floyd performed to promote the album _ are the
most striking aspect of the movie's disjointed episodes. His
surreal, often satirical drawings perfectly capture the traumatic
events in the hero's life _ the ``bricks in the wall'' of his
isolation _ like the death of his father in World War II, the
smothering behavior of his widowed mother and his mistreatment by
his teachers. Parker, who seems to use a sledgehammer instead of a
camera, films the live-action sequences with a literalness that
destroys even the most obvious symbolism: we don't need to see the
actual wriggling worms mentioned in several song lyrics. Waters'
largely autobiographical story, told through 25 wide-ranging songs,
from the hard-hitting guitars of the opening ``In the Flesh'' to
the mock-pompous, Gilbert &AMP; Sullivan-like climax, ``The Trial,''
may be too diffuse for the uninitiated (i.e., non-Pink Floyd fans)
to follow.
</P>
<P>
   A mainstream failure, ``Pink Floyd The Wall'' became an instant
cult favorite. The widescreen transfer has vivid colors and
clarity, all-important for Scarfe's detailed animation. In addition
to ``Retrospective,'' there are a making-of featurette, ``The Other
Side of the Wall''; dozens of production stills and storyboard
drawings; the original music video for the single, ``Another Brick
in the Wall (Part 2)''; and a deleted sequence set to ``Hey You,''
one of the album's most popular songs, but expendable in the movie
since its bludgeoning visuals would have seemed merely repetitive.
Last and most important, there's the newly remixed soundtrack,
which makes the movie's music _ only a fraction of the original
album was re-recorded _ sound as good (and as loud) as ``The Wall''
on CD.
</P>
<P>
   But Floyd fanatics will appreciate hearing Waters, one of the
most dour and publicity-shy rock stars, discuss his most personal
opus at length. He rightly asserts that the major flaw in ``Pink
Floyd The Wall'' is its almost complete lack of humor, then makes
the astonishing comment that humor is something his somber
songwriting never lacked! As if to bolster this assertion, his
commentary is quite funny at times _ he does a dead-on Irish brogue
in imitation of Bob Geldof, who plays ``Pink,'' Waters' alter ego.
</P>
<P>
   One major glitch in the otherwise estimable DVD presentation is
the chapter-search menu, which doesn't list song titles. Jumping to
``Comfortably Numb,'' for example, is difficult without knowing
it's chapter 21. For such a painstaking enterprise, omitting a
chapter-by-chapter song list is unforgivable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pink Floyd The Wall'' may ultimately be best remembered as a
powerful antiwar statement, thanks to the artful coupling of
Parker's brutally effective battle scenes with the animation and
music. The haunting ``Goodbye Blue Sky'' sequence shows Scarfe's
peaceful dove transformed into a menacing hawk as World War II
ravages Europe, while ``In the Flesh'' _ wittily rearranged into a
brassy, Wagnerian march _ creepily demonstrates Waters' assertion
that rock concerts are like Nazi rallies, with Scarfe's menacing,
marching hammers a disturbing fascist symbol.

BELOVED, IN A WAY, AND IMMORTALIZED BY COMPOSERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Jan. 2)  
 (bl)  
 
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There are ways other than recording for musicians to
make sure that something of their personalities survives them: they
can get themselves written into solo pieces or concertos. During a
two-week stay with the New York Philharmonic beginning Thursday at
Avery Fisher Hall, the violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter will play works
written for her by Witold Lutoslawski, Wolfgang Rihm and Krzysztof
Penderecki, as well as more familiar 20th-century concertos by
Sibelius, Berg and Bernstein. So here is a chance to hear how three
prominent composers have created their own images of this
extraordinarily dynamic, technically superb and expressive artist.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier times, Chopin and Paganini made self-portraits, and
anyone who plays their music now is bound to project a little of
what it was like to hear them perform. Mozart was a genius of a
character painter, providing in his music vivid likenesses of such
friends as the coloratura soprano Aloysia Weber and the clarinetist
Anton Stadler. We also know Joseph Joachim from Brahms' Violin
Concerto and other works, Peter Pears from Britten's tenor roles,
and Cathy Berberian from the music Luciano Berio wrote for her to
sing.
</P>
<P>
   Of outstanding contemporary performers, though, rather few have
so far sought out composers to give them this immortality. Some
include a lot of new music in their diverse repertories. But among
those who are more selective _ and who thus give composers the
greatest honor and challenge, placing their works alongside the
classics _ perhaps only Maurizio Pollini, whose individual piano
style has been captured by Luigi Nono and Salvatore Sciarrino in
pieces designed for him, bears comparison with Ms. Mutter.
</P>
<P>
   Her three Philharmonic programs, with a stamina-testing two or
three concertos in each, will be interspersed with two Carnegie
Hall recitals (on Jan. 10 and 17), in which she will present
sonatas and other chamber pieces with Lambert Orkis to round out a
little history of the violin in 20th-century music. It is a history
that includes the 20th-century violin's many personae, as the
instrument of Romantic passion (in Webern's short pieces as much as
the Sibelius Concerto); the fiddle of outsiders and underdogs,
whether Central European peasants (Bartok's Second Sonata) or
Gypsies (Ravel's ``Tzigane''); the rememberer of the Baroque age,
in which the modern violin had its origins (Stravinsky's ``Suite
Italienne'' and Lutoslawski's Partita); or all of these in turn
(Bernstein's ``Serenade'').
</P>
<P>
   But whatever else the violin has been, it has sung. Fingers and
a bowing arm, on strings and a wooden volume, produce the effect of
song without words, and of a voice that can cover a greater range
than that of any human singer: greater in terms not only of pitch
but also of speed, both faster than vocal enunciation can manage
and slower than breath can sustain.
</P>
<P>
   Rihm has written of this quality in connection with the violin
concerto he wrote for Ms. Mutter, ``Time Chant,'' mentioning how he
loves in string instruments ``the drawn-out vocal timbre, the
vibrating of the ray of time, the energy which collects in the note
in order to generate the next note.'' Hence the violin's chanting
of time in his work, of the instant present lengthened out in
sound, often in long high notes that Ms. Mutter's particular
qualities emboldened him to imagine. When he was commissioned by
Paul Sacher to compose a work for her, even while Sacher was
speaking, ``I remembered in a flash high notes that I had heard her
play with uncommon energy and animation,'' Rihm wrote. ``Precisely
in remoteness her playing is richest and most alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Using this ability of Ms. Mutter's to make high notes at once
soft and intense, even piercing, and also immediately present, with
the sense of a person, a body, singing, Rihm's work is likely to be
the big discovery of this residency. It is a soliloquy, almost
unbroken for 25 minutes and mostly slow, with the orchestra,
lightly scored in the main, extending and amplifying the violin's
tones _ though sometimes extending and amplifying them so much as
to threaten the solo line's ability to persist. Yet when the crisis
is past, the violin will generally be revealed still singing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time Chant,'' composed in 1991-92, was the third concerto
Sacher had commissioned for Ms. Mutter, following Lutoslawski's
``Chain 2'' (1984-85), and ``En Reve'' (1988) by the Swiss composer
Norbert Moret. Ms. Mutter will include the Lutoslawski piece in her
first program, along with the Partita the composer arranged for her
soon after, in response to the ``very strong impression'' that her
performances had made on him.
</P>
<P>
   A recent three-CD set of 20th-century concertos performed by Ms.
Mutter, ``Mutter Modern'' on Deutsche Grammophon, includes all
three of the Sacher commissions and the Lutoslawski Partita as well
as the concertos of Stravinsky, Berg and Bartok, and allows one to
understand Lutoslawski's reaction. His ``Chain 2'' is dancing and
delicate, and has the solo instrument spinning through a variety of
violinistic characters: authoritative and fanciful, dreamy and
humorous, athletic and morose. Ms. Mutter brings all these
characters to life, with, again, an almost vocal immediacy. And the
rivaling brilliance and allure in the orchestra throughout should
please the Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   The other concerto Ms. Mutter is bringing with her, Penderecki's
``Metamorphosen,'' is the most recent, dating from 1992-95. Highly
characteristic of the composer in the immense weight it places on
the chromatic scale and other rudimentary musical features, and
strange in its attempts at glitter and lightheartedness, the piece
has the advantage of a big cadenza. It clearly excites Ms. Mutter.
``For me,'' she writes in a note for the Deutsche Grammophon
recording, ``this work represents a physical and mental challenge
for which I feel profoundly grateful.'' And she has expressed that
gratitude in commissioning from Penderecki a sonata, which, had it
been ready, was to have been included in one of her Carnegie Hall
recitals.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mutter's four concertos _ the three she will play with the
Philharmonic plus Moret's excellent and magical piece _ are almost
as unalike as could be, yet something of their intended performer's
special energy infuses all of them. The tightly blazing high notes
that dominate Rihm's piece are there at the start of Penderecki's;
determination at speed is a feature of Moret's ``En Reve'' as much
as of Lutoslawski's ``Chain 2.'' Ms. Mutter is serious and
strong-willed. She must relish the chance to be, in these works,
herself.

PAUL ZALOOM: SITTING ON TOP OF JUNK HEAP OF HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif., Vt.)   Steven Drukman's most recent article for The New York Times' Sunday
Arts &AMP; Leisure section was about David Mamet and the Atlantic
Theater Company.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ While many people can recall the childhood pleasure
of playing in the local junkyard, most of them washed their hands
of that sort of thing long ago.
</P>
<P>
   But not Paul Zaloom, whose 10th solo show, entitled
``Velvetville,'' opens Wednesday here at Performance Space 122 in
the East Village. Since 1978, Zaloom has not only refused to
outgrow rooting among the rubbish; he has recycled a life's career
from it. Deemed ``a Paganini of found objects'' by The Los Angeles
Times, Zaloom has forged his own brand of performance art that in
his words ``uses the detritus of our civilization against what it
was created for _ that is, makes junk into art.''
</P>
<P>
   Zaloom, 48, sees himself as part of an avant-garde tradition
that includes Marcel Duchamp, Claes Oldenburg and Pop art. His
original inspiration was to recreate the Parisian junk circuses of
Alexander Calder in the 1920s. ``Calder would play a show in his
living room with these cool puppets made out of junk,'' Zaloom said
by telephone from his home in Los Angeles. ``I wanted to create a
world that would fit into a suitcase that I could schlep around.''
</P>
<P>
   He began his career in 1971 with the Bread and Puppet Theater in
Glover, Vt., blending their blunt style of political activism with
his zany Zaloomian brand of comedy. ``In the late '70s, I became
interested in trying to make people laugh at things that would
inevitably kill us all,'' he said. This led to a series of solo
shows that resembled the creations of an overgrown boy, home from a
day at the dump, making Punch and Judy shows out of toilet brushes
and plastic cups.
</P>
<P>
   Often armed with just an overhead projector and a tabletop of
junk, Zaloom manipulates the castoffs of the industrialized world
to ``satirize,'' as he puts it, ``the hazards of out-of-control
consumption.''
</P>
<P>
   His Obie Award-winning work ``House of Horror,'' in 1989, told
the story of the Smiths, a family of puppets allergic to their
toxic house. His ``My Civilization'' (1991) parodied the
potentially toxic ``food products'' that pass for nourishment these
days. The next year, his ``Sick but True'' called attention to
Chernobyl, ocean dumping and other ecological disasters. He and his
clutter have filled a number of mainstream stages, including the
Kennedy Center, Lincoln Center and the American Repertory Theater.
</P>
<P>
   The common denominator of every performance is Zaloom's madcap
persona. Sped up and wide-eyed, he manipulates his primitive
puppets like a Mister Rogers on diet pills. In fact, Zaloom may be
best known for playing the crazy scientist Beakman in the
children's television show ``Beakman's World,'' now broadcast on
the Sci-Fi channel and local stations around the country. Beakman
sports a chartreuse lab coat and a dark fright wig and his
theatrics are all about making science anything but nerdy.
</P>
<P>
   Zaloom is fond of what he calls ``visual punning'' as a mode of
political commentary. In ``My Civilization,'' starving artists were
represented by narrow paint brushes; in his new ``Velvetville,''
New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is ``played'' by a squeegee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Velvetville,'' Zaloom said, is a ``three-ring, low-tech
multimedia circus'' that uses black velvet paintings to depict ``a
cast of characters from the jolly land of American kitsch,
including the Smurfs, lawn jockeys, etc.''
</P>
<P>
   This intermission-less narrative travels from Los Angeles to the
Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island, ending as a nightmare about
the forthcoming Republican National Convention in Philadelphia this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   As a performance artist _ a job definition, he says, that suits
him as much as ``social satirist, puppeteer or schmendrick'' (a
Yiddish term for nobody) _ Zaloom takes trash (if not himself)
seriously. ``Velvetville'' represents his latest comedic attempt to
put kitsch in sync.

`TITUS ANDRONICUS': A SHAKESPEARE TALE WHOSE TIME HAS COME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Jan. 2)  
 Jonathan Bate edited the text of ``Titus Andronicus'' for the Arden
Shakespeare series.  
 (bl)  
 By JONATHAN BATE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ If William Shakespeare were alive today, he would be
writing and directing movies. Julie Taymor's ``Titus'' offers a
glimpse of what they might be like: challenging but accessible,
tragic and comic, responsive to the past yet relevant to the
present.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Taymor's favorite scene in the 1998 movie ``Shakespeare in
Love'' is the one in which Will encounters a boy outside his
theater feeding mice to a cat. The little torturer expresses his
admiration for a certain play in which heads are cut off and a
daughter mutilated with knives. ``When I write plays,'' he says,
``they will be like `Titus'.'' Will is pleased. He asks the boy his
name: it is John Webster.
</P>
<P>
   The real Webster was the most gifted of the generation of
playwrights who followed Shakespeare. He excelled in darkly
brilliant revenge tragedies that veer between extreme violence and
black comedy. Webster was the Quentin Tarantino of his age, but he
didn't invent this mixed style of drama. As the scene in
``Shakespeare in Love'' suggests, credit there belongs to Will
himself. The bloody but witty ``Titus Andronicus'' was young
Shakespeare's first box-office smash, the work that made his name,
the first of his plays to appear in print.
</P>
<P>
   Though enormously successful in its own time, ``Titus'' was an
embarrassment to later generations. When the hero confronts the
horrific fate of his children, he does not cry or curse. He laughs.
Critics in the 18th and 19th centuries could not cope with such
incongruity, but it strikes a chord in us. The Elizabethans were
not afraid to confront violence in ways that are simultaneously
shocking and playful. In this we are like them, and so it is that
``Titus'' is the Shakespeare play for the turn of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Bloody revenge, dismemberment, rape, feigned madness,
cannibalism: what more could a movie need? Interviewed in London on
the day she won an Evening Standard award for ``The Lion King,''
Julie Taymor said she had had a tough fight with the Motion Picture
Association of America to win ``Titus'' an R as opposed to an NC-17
rating. She found herself defending her movie in a telephone call
from Venice _ ``I'm in a city,'' she said, ``where the churches
have frescoes on the walls showing scenes much more shocking than
anything in my film.'' She agreed to cut a handful of shots from
her Roman orgy, but what is revealing about her defense is the
comparison with Renaissance paintings of the martyred and the
damned. It points to two things: the visual quality of Ms. Taymor's
imagination, which is everywhere apparent in the movie, and her
belief that ``Titus'' is no Shakespearean potboiler but a profound
exploration of the darker recesses of humanity, a tour de force
that can hold its own with the greatest and most troubling creative
works of Western culture.
</P>
<P>
   The movie was made at the Cinecitta studios in Rome, and such
scenes as the orgy inevitably invite comparison with ``Fellini
Satyricon,'' especially since Ms. Taymor's production designer,
Dante Ferretti, worked with Fellini. There are also touches of
Pasolini, a master at dramatizing emotional extremity in harshly
lighted landscapes. But the richest influence is Shakespeare's own
proto-cinematic imagination. Ms. Taymor has the gift of finding
visual equivalents for the dramatist's figurative verse. The two
locations at the center of her ``Titus,'' a swamp and a crossroads,
are peculiarly haunting. They translate Shakespearean poetry into
the language of cinema.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the film fully respects the original words,
reproducing a higher percentage of text than any other recent
screen adaptation of Shakespeare, with the exception of Kenneth
Branagh's over-long ``Hamlet'' in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like Pasolini, Shakespeare believed that ancient myths can speak
to modern times. ``Titus Andronicus'' mingles mythology, history
and invention. The story is patterned on the tale of Philomel, who
was raped by her brother-in-law. He cuts out her tongue so that she
cannot reveal his identity, but she finds another way of
communicating, enabling her sister to serve up a horrible revenge.
Shakespeare took this mythic prototype and retold it through an
invented narrative about a fictional Roman general, Titus
Andronicus, who returns from successful wars against the Goths only
to find himself at odds with the new emperor. Rome collapses into
chaos from within.
</P>
<P>
   The play is set simultaneously in timeless myth, imperial Rome
and Shakespeare's own Europe. Ms. Taymor, too, creates a stylish
interplay of past and present, with chariots one moment and
motorcycles the next. She reads ``Titus'' as a compendium of 2,000
years of warfare and violence. The Colosseum scenes were shot in
Croatia; proximity to Bosnia and Kosovo was a constant reminder
that the atrocities of war are as modern as they are ancient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Titus,'' Ms. Taymor said, is not just about violence; ``it's
about how we make entertainment out of violence.'' Hence the
movie's opening sequence, adapted from the director's 1994 New York
stage production of the play, in which a boy stages a battle of toy
soldiers to the accompaniment of television violence. Play becomes
reality as war intrudes and the child is catapulted into the
ancient Colosseum. The subsequent action is witnessed through his
eyes _ which become our eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of pity in the act of witnessing is one reason Ms.
Taymor is right to resist easy parallels with Quentin Tarantino. ``
`Pulp Fiction' is all surface,'' she said, whereas in ``Titus''
both the characters and the audience go on an inward journey in
which the human reaction to violence is of more consequence than
the violence itself. At the heart of the movie is a scene involving
the killing of a fly, in which black comedy momentarily gives way
to an exquisite tenderness, delicately rendered by both Ms.
Taymor's camera and Anthony Hopkins' performance as Titus.
</P>
<P>
   Only a great actor at the height of his powers can do justice to
the sheer range of feeling within the character. Laurence Olivier
achieved it in Peter Brook's 1955 stage production, which redeemed
the play from centuries of neglect and disparagement. Now Hopkins,
who began his career under Olivier in the early days of London's
National Theater, has achieved it on film. His performance is not
without moments of homage to Olivier's grand style, but it is
richest when it is quiet rather than loud, especially when the once
proud general is reduced to seeking tearful sympathy from the
stones in the roadway.
</P>
<P>
   Titus' outburst against the injustice of the world is equally
memorable: ``If there were reason for these miseries, / Then into
limits could I bind my woes.'' Ms. Taymor regards such lines as a
match for any in Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   She is equally enthusiastic about the role of Titus' opponent,
Tamora, queen of the Goths (Jessica Lange). ``Why do people make
such a fuss about Lady Macbeth?'' she said. ``We never learn what
her motives are, whereas with Tamora it's understandable from the
start: she's a wronged mother.'' Shakespeare's text compares Tamora
to a ``ravenous tiger,'' an image Ms. Taymor brings to the screen
in one of the film's dreamlike insets. Tamora is fierce because she
is protective of her young _ a Tiger Queen out for revenge because
Titus has ordered the sacrificial execution of her eldest son.
</P>
<P>
   Her two younger sons, Chiron and Demetrius, are disturbingly
familiar to a late-20th-century audience. Bored young Goths, they
go on a killing spree for the sheer fun of it. The movie had
wrapped before the massacre at Columbine High, but Ms. Taymor
sensed the resonance when it happened. Shakespeare doesn't crudely
demonize Tamora's boys. He shows us that peer group pressure and
the spirit of competition can lead young men to kill and rape.
</P>
<P>
   Tamora's sons are egged on by their mother's lover, Aaron the
Moor (played by Harry J. Lennix, the one actor in the movie
retained from Ms. Taymor's stage version). Aaron is the first great
Shakespearean villain, the forerunner of Richard III, Iago and
Edmund in ``King Lear.'' But he is also the first great black role
in English drama. Ms. Taymor regards the part as more complex than
that of Othello. Aaron is motivated by his status as an outsider.
At first he seems to be the devil incarnate. But toward the end,
there is an astonishing turnaround. ``Zounds, ye whore,'' he says
to the nurse who hands him his first-born son with an insult, ``is
black so base a hue?'' Black pride and paternal affection undo the
ancient racist equation of darkness with evil.
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare's text is not explicit about the final fate of
Aaron's baby. His survival will depend on the integrity of Lucius,
Titus' only surviving son. Will the cycle of blood for blood go on,
or is there hope for the future? Ms. Taymor's stage production was
ambiguous, whereas the movie ends on an uplifting note, with a
closing image of singular beauty. Though filmed before the release
of ``Shakespeare in Love,'' the scene is satisfyingly reminiscent
of Gwyneth Paltrow's walk along the shore of the brave New World at
the close of that movie. Ms. Taymor insists that she has not bowed
to the Hollywood convention of happy endings; the decision was
made, she said, when the actor playing Lucius (Angus MacFadyen)
persuaded her that his was a character who would keep his word.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the merits of this particular production choice, the
way in which it was made is symptomatic of the integrity of Ms.
Taymor's project. She has respected both an ancient work of art and
a modern company of screen actors. Her reward is to have created
something very special. Where so many movies impress at the time
but fade in the instant you walk out of the theater, ``Titus''
keeps on growing in the imagination.

RECREATING BACH IN HIS OWN ELEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Jan. 2)  
 Bernard D. Sherman is the author of ``Inside Early Music:
Conversations With Performers.''  
 (bl)  
 By BERNARD D. SHERMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bach fanatics have long fantasized about an auditory time
machine that might carry them back to the 18th century and to the
Thomaskirche in Leipzig, where they could hear Bach leading his
cantatas. Now a remarkable recording from Deutsche Grammophon
simulates what such time travelers would be after.
</P>
<P>
   Titled ``J.S. Bach: Epiphany Mass,'' it is a ``liturgical
reconstruction'': a performance, with Paul McCreesh leading the
Gabrieli Consort and Players, that puts sacred music into something
like its original church context. Many early-music advocates claim
that period instruments are critical to proper performance;
liturgical reconstruction extends that argument to the
performance's original setting.
</P>
<P>
   The claim that context matters is hard to support in much of
Bach. The inner logic of his music makes it less dependent on
surroundings (and for that matter, instruments) than most Baroque
repertory. The works included here (the Cantatas Nos. 65 and 180,
the Mass in F, the Sanctus in D and various organ works) have all
been recorded before, out of context and to good effect. Some
critics write off the reconstructive attitude in Bach as so much
historical nostalgia, the same sentiment that gives rise to
reconstructions of Civil War battles. One harpsichordist called
liturgical reconstruction ``historical performance practice run
amok.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, when applied specifically to the cantatas, the case for
context in Bach is plausible. For many years, critics have pointed
to features that can make the cantatas seem out of place in a
concert hall. A cantata from Bach's Leipzig period typically has a
front-heavy structure: a substantial opening chorus, which one
author compared to a locomotive, a train of movements for soloists
and a caboose of a final chorale. Bach, the argument continues,
would have structured the cantatas differently for concert use.
Besides, the expressive ends of his cantatas are religious, not
just aesthetic. For such reasons, critics conclude, the cantatas
would best be understood in their original setting, like an
altarpiece in the church it was designed for.
</P>
<P>
   That original setting was an orthodox Lutheran service,
consisting of four hours of readings, prayers, sermons and singing
_ and a cantata or two. McCreesh, aided by liturgical scholar Robin
A. Leaver, tries to create an aural facsimile of what ``might have
been celebrated'' in Bach's church, the Thomaskirche, on the feast
of the Epiphany, Jan. 6, around 1740. While the results are in
various ways modernized, they do indeed shed light on Bach's
approach to sacred music.
</P>
<P>
   Bach wrote cantatas as he did partly because his job in writing
them was to preach. By design, the cantatas function like sermons,
interpreting the biblical message and applying it to the worshiper.
This recording (Archiv 457 631-2; two CDs) lets us hear the process
at work.
</P>
<P>
   After we listen to a reading of the Bible text of the day,
telling the story of the three wise men bearing gifts to the
newborn Jesus, we hear the text sung in the richly conceived
opening chorus of Cantata No. 65, ``Sie Werden aus Saba Alle
Kommen'' (``From Sheba Will They All Arrive''). Then, in
recitatives and arias, we hear a moral message drawn from the Bible
text. ``Gold of Ophir is too plain,'' the bass soloist exhorts (in
18th-century German verse). ``Away with these empty gifts dug from
the earth!/ What Jesus desires is thy heart./ Present it to Jesus,
thou Christian throng, as a New Year's gift.''
</P>
<P>
   Such texts, which make some modern Bach lovers cringe, seem
purposeful when we hear why Bach was setting them. And the final
chorale (``Now, my Lord, I give myself to Thy care'') seems not a
caboose here but a prism that focuses the theological message.
</P>
<P>
   Bach's listeners liked being preached to. Some were known to
attend two or even three services on a Sunday so they could hear
more sermons. But few Bach devotees today share that predilection.
What most of us listen for is the composer's musical art.
Recognizing our aim, McCreesh saves us busy moderns at least an
hour off the real 18th-century experience, mostly by cutting the
actual sermon short. In Bach's day, sermons typically lasted an
hour or more; here the sermon lasts six minutes.
</P>
<P>
   It is an excerpt from a sermon by Martin Luther, published in
1545. Sermons from Bach's era are abundantly available in print,
even if none are from his church in Leipzig. Bach's contemporaries
might have used a sermon by Luther in a pinch, but McCreesh clearly
chooses one for a different reason: Luther's historical prominence
lends interest to his sermon even for secular listeners.
</P>
<P>
   Bach owned not only two complete sets of Luther's publications
but also more than a dozen books of published sermons by his own
contemporaries. His interest in them was not unusual for his era.
But it certainly would be for ours. Most listeners will undoubtedly
welcome McCreesh's historical license, just as spectators are
relieved that a Civil War reconstruction refrains from using real
bullets. If an hourlong sermon were included, it would skip over
it.

JONES' MEETING WITH COWBOYS PLAYERS NOT A SLAM TO GAILEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's get a couple of points straight.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey didn't attend the much-publicized
meeting that owner Jerry Jones had Monday with about 20 veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey knew about the meeting and] discussed it with Jones
beforehand. But he was not present.
</P>
<P>
   However, Jones' private meeting] should not be construed as
evidence that Gailey is a ``yes'' man, or as an example of Jones
undercutting Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey surely didn't take it that way. He said Jones owns the
team and can talk to the team whenever he wants.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Gailey has ample time to talk to the players. In fact,
he had a team meeting Monday. And, just as in the Jones' meeting
where Jones was the only one who talked, Gailey's meeting had only
one speaker: Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   Like Jones, Gailey reiterated how crucial it is for the players
to put last week's disappointment against the Saints behind them
and focus on taking advantage of another gift-wrapped opportunity
to make something out of the frustrating season.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Jones, who raised his voice a lot and even beat on a
table a couple of times, Gailey's part-scripted speech was
matter-of-fact, but it was just as passionate.
</P>
<P>
   Why didn't you know about it? That's a good question because
Gailey mentioned in his news briefing Monday that he would talk to
the team.
</P>
<P>
   I guess the sight of 20 players marching into Jones' office was
more noteworthy to report than a routine Gailey-led team meeting.
Unlike Jones, Gailey does that on a weekly basis.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's not like these same pleas haven't been issued in
some form or fashion after every loss this season. The playoff
scenario was specifically voiced before the loss to the Jets two
week ago, and to the loss to the Saints last week.
</P>
<P>
   If the Cowboys' play can be used as evidence, then both times
the message went in one ear and out the other.
</P>
<P>
   What's the other cliche? Talk is cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey's speech and Jones' speech will become nothing but hot
air if the Cowboys don't beat the Giants on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The question is why should anybody believe that things will be
different this time? Smart and not smart enough Chan Gailey said
the biggest problem, outside of injuries, the Cowboys have faced
this season is they haven't played smart football.
</P>
<P>
   He said they will have to find a way to play smart football if
they are to beat the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Their status as the league's most penalized team tops the list
of examples of their dumb play in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   That's bad enough. But if there were a category for a team that
committed the most penalties at the worst possible times, they
would lead there, too.
</P>
<P>
   There is never a good time to commit a penalty, but some times
are better than others. How many times have the Cowboys hurt
themselves with offensive and/or defensive penalties inside the
20-yard line that prevented scores, or led to scores, or in the
fourth quarter of close ballgames, or on special teams resulting in
huge yardage swings late in games?
</P>
<P>
   Other examples of not playing smart _ Gailey does not like to
use the word dumb _ include numerous missed assignments and blown
assignments.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the misplays, when a player tries to
compensate for deficiencies elsewhere and gets beat in his area.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's trying to be too smart. Against the Saints,
cornerback Deion Sanders was burned for a 50-yard reception by
receiver Keith Poole because Sanders believed the pass was going to
another receiver. He was anticipating to make a play on the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive coordinator Dave Campo said he couldn't get mad at
Sanders because the All-Pro cornerback is a playmaker. Campo said
the Cowboys have benefited from similar moves by Sanders. It just
didn't work out this time.
</P>
<P>
   This brings us back to Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey's much talked about phone-book-thick playbook that
features numerous plays out of a variety of sets and formations,
has contributed to the Cowboys' undoing.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, who likes to keep teams off balance by pushing the
envelope with varying schemes, concedes he needs to simplify
(dumb-down) the play book because of so many blown assignments.
</P>
<P>
   There's no question that Gailey has become too cute on offense
at times.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the playbook is too thick or the players' heads are too
thick will be part of the off-season evaluation process.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said he will solve the smart problem whether by changing
the explanation, the teaching process, the scheme or the players.
Yardsticks Former TCU receiver Jason Tucker set two team records
against the Saints. His 203 yards on six kickoff returns topped the
mark of 198 set by Herschel Walker against Atlanta in 1996. His
combined yardage mark of 331, which included his 128 receiving
yards, eclipsed Kevin Williams' team high of 307, set against the
Cardinals in 1995. First down Much-maligned tight end David LaFleur
has seven touchdown receptions, which are the most for a Cowboys
tight end since Billy Joe Dupree had seven in 1980. With two more,
LaFleur would tie Dupree's club record for tight ends, set in 1978.
Fourth down For the few remaining optimists, consider that if the
Cowboys make the playoffs, they will play every game on the road.
The Cowboys, 1-7 on the road this season, have lost seven
consecutive road games. They haven't won a road game outside the
NFC East in 27 months, an 11-game slide.

TO REACH PLAYOFFS, COWBOYS NEED EMMITT SMITH TO GET LOOSE

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Cowboys can't hide from one fact about their
loss to the New York Giants earlier this season: They couldn't run.
</P>
<P>
   Pro Bowl running back Emmitt Smith had the second-lowest
per-carry average of his 10-year career in the Cowboys' 13-10 loss
to the Giants on Oct. 18. He gained 26 yards on 22 carries. His
longest run was 5 yards, and on 10 carries, he gained 0 or minus
yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys play the Giants again Sunday. A victory earns the
Cowboys the NFC's final playoff berth. A loss earns the Cowboys a
permanent vacation from this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' future depends on how well they run against the
Giants, who held them to 25 yards as a team last time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to run the ball better than we did last time. There's
no doubt about it,'' Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said. ``... Even
though we stayed with the running game fairly well, we didn't run
it well enough. It was more us than it was them.''
</P>
<P>
   After that game, Gailey said the Cowboys abandoned their finesse
running game for more of a power running game. And since then, the
Cowboys have been held to fewer than 100 rushing yards only once.
The New England Patriots limited the Cowboys to 63 yards rushing on
23 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went back to a more right-at-you type running game instead
of some of the finesse things we had in at that point, and it has
done better for us,'' Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' strength is their front seven, featuring Pro Bowlers
Michael Strahan and Jessie Armstead. The Giants are allowing 94.1
rushing yards per game, which ranks fifth in the NFC.
</P>
<P>
   In their 19-17 victory against the Buffalo Bills three weeks
ago, the Giants held the Bills to 76 rushing yards. Quarterback
Doug Flutie was the Bills' leading rusher with 25 yards on six
carries.
</P>
<P>
   But teams have not always had to run away from the run against
the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans Saints rookie Ricky Williams had 111 yards on 24
carries in the Giants' 31-3 victory on Oct. 24. Indianapolis rookie
Edgerrin James had 108 yards on 16 carries in the Giants' 27-19
loss to the Colts on Nov. 14, and a week later, Stephen Davis ran
for 183 yards on 33 carries in the Redskins' 23-13 defeat of the
Giants. Just Sunday, in the Minnesota Vikings' 34-17 victory
against the Giants, Robert Smith rushed for 146 yards on 16
carries.
</P>
<P>
   This week against the Giants, Emmitt Smith, who ranks fourth in
the NFL with 1,275 yards, and the Cowboys will be on a playoff run.

 NEW YORK: over it.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Listeners might also be grateful for other accommodations
McCreesh has made to the present. For one thing, he has chosen a
gentle, positive liturgical theme; the Epiphany celebrates the
visit of the Magi. A more typical liturgical experience from
18th-century Leipzig might have featured a cantata like No. 26,
``Ach Wie Fluechtig, Ach Wie Nichtig'' (``Ah How Fleeting, Ah How
Trivial''), the title referring to human life on earth. That
cantata, Leipzig hymn schedules specified, was to appear in
services filled with hymns concerning death and dying. By contrast,
McCreesh presents major-key cantatas, accompanied by hymns
expressing wonder. If the recording doesn't truly transport us to
Leipzig, 1740, it does transport us.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, this release might have broader appeal than most Bach
cantata recordings. It could gain a following among the New Age
listeners who made best-sellers of Hildegard of Bingen and
Gregorian chant, for it creates a golden, celestial aura that most
Bach choral music doesn't aim for. (It is hard, for example, to
imagine a New Age following for the ``St. Matthew Passion,'' with
its ruminations on guilt and remorse.)
</P>
<P>
   True, while a typical performance turns a Bach cantata from a
primarily religious utterance into a purely aesthetic one, a
reconstruction like this, it could be argued, turns the entire
Leipzig church service into an aesthetic object. Yet the argument
would be a bit unfair.
</P>
<P>
   For all its concessions to modern needs, this recording feels
more like a church service than a concert. The sense of transport
comes not only from the music but also, to a large degree, from
liturgical details McCreesh re-enacts: the bells, the
congregational hymns and the general sense of shared purpose. Even
for those who may already have known that in orthodox Lutheran
services the German Bible texts and many of the prayers were not
simply read aloud but chanted in quasi-Gregorian style, there is
something about actually hearing such ``heightened'' speech that
creates a sense of mystery.
</P>
<P>
   The Lutheran liturgy had elements besides the sermon that do not
translate well to home listening. One of Luther's innovations was
to allow the congregation to participate in some of the singing, in
contrast to the Roman Catholic rite, which reserved virtually all
the singing for the priests and choir. Whatever one thinks of
Luther's reform from a religious standpoint, the Catholic approach
has advantages for record listeners, who may conclude as much after
hearing those Lutheran hymns that repeat the same music verse after
verse. One example here goes on for more than 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   As the Bach scholar Michael Marissen points out, if you were
singing the music yourself in a church service, the repetitions
might be involving; but for modern listeners, the skip button might
again come in handy. On the other hand, the elements least
congenial to home listening, like these hymns, contribute most to
the feeling of eavesdropping on a church service.
</P>
<P>
   How historical is the service here? The question applies most
sharply to the Bach performances themselves, as readers familiar
with early music might expect. The use of a female soprano, Ann
Monoyios, is an obvious compromise with modern realities. (Bach
used boy sopranos.) But her singing is first-rate. Other choices
held to be purely historical are just as palatable to the ear.
Using only one voice per part in some choruses produces beguiling
results. And McCreesh argues that Bach would have used a large
cathedral organ to accompany, instead of the chamber organs typical
in early-music performances; the added color and weight of the
large instrument could set a trend.
</P>
<P>
   McCreesh's colleagues will argue about these choices and more (a
couple of speedy tempos, for example). And his critics will note
that even the most unerringly faithful reconstruction _ for that
matter, even a time machine _ would not give us the real 1740
experience, if only because our cultural and intellectual world
differs so much from that of Bach. As a trivial example, the impact
of one of Luther's biggest innovations _ using the everyday
language rather than Latin _ is lost on us. For most of us, the
period German sounds at least as foreign as the Roman church's
Latin did to Bach's parishioners (who heard a bit of Latin in their
services every week). Even modern Germans find the period German
archaic. Nor do we know the hymns that Bach's congregation knew by
heart.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, we are not there to worship. And if we were, modern
Lutheran worshipers would not share the kind of belief that gripped
Bach and his audience. Bach believed in the divine ordination of
kings and aristocrats. He and his listeners worried about the Devil
and damnation far more literally than most Lutherans do today. To
Bach's listeners, the cantata texts did not seem archaic. Neither
did Luther's denunciations of Jews and Catholics. We can't really
join Bach's congregation _ few of us would want to _ and even to
imagine our way into their church experience demands more than
listening to CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the glow of this recording can almost make one forget such
barriers. It is true that Bach cantatas, taken out of context,
would have continued to move us even without McCreesh's help. And
the only reason most of us want to hear a historical Lutheran
service re-enacted is Bach's music, which stands out as exceptional
in its original context, as listeners will find.
</P>
<P>
   Still, by taking us halfway to Bach's turf, this reconstruction
reveals something about the music that no other recording quite
manages. This music may not depend on its historical context, but
context can reveal fascinating things about it all the same.

`NYPD BLUE': NEW FACES AND FACETS AT THE STATION HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Jan. 2)  
 (bl)  
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a corner of the closed ``NYPD Blue'' set at the
20th Century Fox studios, David Milch, the co-creator of the
series, with Steven Bochco, sat on a wooden chair restlessly
tapping his foot. Milch, who controls the writing and often the
direction of every episode, is now in the midst of his seventh _
and final _ season (at least with such day-to-day involvement) on
this acclaimed television series about the lives of a group of New
York cops. The season's first episode will be shown Tuesday, Jan.
11.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big pitfall is thinking of it as the seventh season
instead of a new season,'' said Milch, a 54-year-old former
literature instructor at Yale with a passion for the racetrack.
``Changes are being introduced. New characters. New facets explored
of the other characters. We're like a jazz ensemble. We trust each
other. No one is afraid to improvise. Like good jazz, it never gets
old.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact Milch and Bochco are fully aware that the series, which
has won 19 Emmy Awards, is getting old _ and slowly, inevitably
reaching its final lap. Perhaps next year _ especially with the
show in other hands _ perhaps the year after.
</P>
<P>
   From its season debut last year until the end of May, ``NYPD
Blue'' averaged 14.5 million viewers, its lowest season average
ever, and ranked No. 15. ABC initially considered moving the show
from its traditional time slot (Tuesday at 10 p.m.), but when an
angry Bochco went to newspapers and complained about the network's
disloyalty, ABC backed down.
</P>
<P>
   Bochco, who is consumed with a new CBS series, ``City of
Angels,'' about an inner-city hospital, has signed a five-year $45
million to $50 million deal with Paramount to develop series for
various networks, starting in January. Similarly, Milch, who began
his television career writing for ``Hill Street Blues,'' has signed
a separate and lucrative deal with Paramount.
</P>
<P>
   Both men insisted that they would continue to play creative,
albeit diminished, roles on ``NYPD Blue.'' And longtime cast
members Dennis Franz and Kim Delaney said that Milch was so
obsessed with the show _ and so personally identified with its
characters, especially Franz's tormented character, Detective Andy
Sipowicz _ that he would continue to be a forceful presence.
</P>
<P>
   ( Milch endured a half-dozen angioplasties to deal with heart
blockages in the first two years of the series, and the ordeal was
realistically employed last year on the series when Jimmy Smits'
character, Detective Bobby Simone, died of heart disease.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if the baby grows up,'' said Ms. Delaney, who portrays
Detective Diane Russell, ``David and Steven will take care of it.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Milch and Bochco are immersed in not only taking
care of the show but somehow proving to ABC, and perhaps
themselves, that ``NYPD Blue'' will endure beyond next season, and
the one after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show will change; there's no question about it,'' said
Bochco, seated in his spare, elegant office in a corner of the Fox
lot. ``Particularly after the first years, David's hands-on,
day-in-day-out writing of the show has been its heart and soul. His
talent and humor and sensibility and angst have informed the show.
He works tirelessly and madly. But with David essentially leaving,
it's a great opportunity to feature different voices. There'll be
different passions. But that's nothing to be afraid of.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps half of the new season's 22 episodes have already been
made, mostly on the Fox lot, with periodic trips to New York to
shoot exterior scenes. Although some of the plot lines are secret
(and many are still swirling in Milch's imagination), the fact is,
``NYPD Blue'' is facing some dramatic changes in the new year.
</P>
<P>
   Partly to lure younger audiences, the relatively new character,
Andy Sipowicz's partner, Detective Danny Sorenson (Rick Schroder),
will have an affair with a policewoman. (The casting last year of
Schroder, who looks like a sweet-faced choirboy, was a bit of a
surprise. But Schroder, who is 29 and plays Sorenson with a thick
New York accent, has given the series a certain cockiness and
authenticity that eluded the more glamorous and remote Smits.)
</P>
<P>
   A character who has been underused in the series, Detective Jill
Kirkendall (Andrea Thompson), a single mother, will be the focus of
several early episodes involving her sleazy former husband, with
whom she's still in love.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, what I like so much about the show is that they
didn't hook me up with anybody right away and you just got to see
her working as a good solid cop,'' said Ms. Thompson, who has been
on the show four years. ``So often when you're on television you're
somebody's wife or girlfriend and you rarely just get to see women
working, doing a job and not making a big deal of it.''
</P>
<P>
   A new character, Detective Baldwin Jones, who is black (his
fictional mother named him after the writer James Baldwin), will
become a full-time character in midseason.
</P>
<P>
   The detective, played by 29-year-old Henry Simmons, a 6-foot-4
former soap opera actor who once worked as one of those sleek
doormen at Morgan's Hotel in New York, will inevitably pose some
challenges for the Sipowicz character, who has unresolved racial
problems, as will Lt. Arthur Fancy (James McDaniel), the other
significant black character in the series. Simmons essentially
replaces Nicholas Turturro, who is easing up on his involvement
with the show to pursue a film career. ( Turturro's character,
Detective James Martinez, will become ill.)
</P>
<P>
   Simmons still seemed a little shaken at his good fortune. He
drove cross-country from New York in June with a U-Haul and landed
the part in October after several auditions. Milch told Simmons he
had the job but asked him to meet Bochco. ``I went in and Bochco
asked me how I felt and I told him, `Look, I just want to get our
of here and scream.'''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Simmons said he was even more intimidated about meeting Franz,
whom he initially thought would turn out to be like the sometimes
snarling and angry Sipowicz. ``He turned out to be the nicest and
most humble man,'' said Simmons.
</P>
<P>
   Franz will, of course, remain a major focus of the show but the
tragedy and emotions that have shaped his character will be muted.
The Sipowicz character, an alcoholic who is on and off the wagon,
has endured the deaths of his son, his wife (played by Sharon
Lawrence) and his partner ( Smits).
</P>
<P>
   Franz himself has slimmed down under doctor's orders, losing
about 40 pounds on a low-carbohydrate, high-protein diet. (As a
result, Milch had asked the actor to climb into the shower for a
nude scene. But Franz said he had not lost that much weight, and
the scene was shot from the waist up. (He was not so cautious
several seasons ago when his bare posterior was shown in one
scene.)
</P>
<P>
   Franz, as well as Milch and Bochco, have sought in the new year
to give Sipowicz's life a certain normalcy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't continue to put him through this constant torment
forever,'' said Franz. ``He has to mellow out. He's a single father
now and is realizing that role. I would like him to possibly try
his hand at romance again.''
</P>
<P>
   Bochco put it another way. ``Nobody can live in a perpetual
state of despair,'' he said. ``And no one wants to watch somebody
in a perpetual state of despair.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he was so fascinated with law enforcement, Bochco, who
has helped create series like ``Brooklyn South'' and ``Hill Street
Blues,'' said: ``For me, cops personify themes that are very
interesting: ethics, justice, law. I also find cops compelling
because they're flawed and ordinary people who are asked to be
incredibly brave and courageous. And these are people who have
tremendous on-the-job stress and often go home to complicated home
lives, as we all do. The difference is they strap a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Milch is even more intrigued with the police. A retired New York
City detective, Bill Clark, now an executive producer, brings out a
handful of police officers every week to Los Angeles to talk to the
writers about their experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``A broad audience is reluctant to invest in characters who
cannot bring about change in a decisive, simple way,'' said Milch.
``So that kind of leaves you with doctors and cops. I once did a
show about reporters, but they don't carry guns. And a good cop, a
really good cop, understands the criminal mind because he's half a
criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   It's characteristic of Milch's constantly evolving, sometimes
blurry writing style that series stars like Franz, Schroder (who
replaced Smits), Ms. Thompson, Ms. McDaniel and Ms. Delaney have
little idea where the overlapping plots are heading. In fact the
actors often arrive at the studio not fully aware of that day's
plot line or dialogue, an unusual way for a series to operate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow's work will be written today, and in one day we've
shot scenes for three different episodes,'' said Schroder, the
Staten Island-born former child star, seated in his trailer covered
with pictures of his wife and their three young children. ``I've
never worked like this before. I don't think anyone has.''
</P>
<P>
   In a nearby trailer, Bill Brochtrup, who plays John Irvin, a gay
secretary working in the squad room, said his character was devised
as a type of Greek chorus whose often nonverbal reactions to events
_ a gaze, a look of shock, a laugh _ are intended to mirror the
reactions of the television audience. Like Schroder, Brochtrup said
that the show's success was based partly on the unusual
improvisational style and last-minute writing that gives the show
its immediacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it's 2 o'clock in the afternoon and I still don't
quite know yet what's happening,'' said Brochtrup, breaking into a
laugh. ``David is constantly changing things and reworking scenes
and writing them kind of as the inspiration comes.''
</P>
<P>
   Milch said it would, of course, be difficult for for him to
leave the show. ``I'm 54 years old and I have other things I want
to do, but I'm not sure I will ever really leave the show,'' he
said. ``It's simply that at this point there are other windows I
want to look out from. Fitzgerald said, `Life is best looked at
from a single window.' Well, I've certainly looked at it from a
single window. Maybe Fitzgerald was wrong. Maybe there's more than
one window.''

JAMES THURBER: ONLY A GLOOMY MAN COULD HAVE MADE HOSTILITY SO
FUNNY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, N.Y.)   (For release Sunday, Jan. 2)  
 (bl)  
 By CHARLES STRUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The notion that writers of short, humorous pieces
``are gay of heart and carefree is curiously untrue,'' wrote James
Thurber in 1933.
</P>
<P>
   ``To call such persons `humorists,' a loose-fitting and ugly
word, is to miss the nature of their dilemma and the dilemma of
their nature,'' he continued. ``The little wheels of their
invention are set in motion by the damp hand of melancholy.''
</P>
<P>
   Poignant revelation, leavened with wit, from a man whose
crystalline prose appeared primarily in The New Yorker for 30
years. A son of Columbus, Ohio, Thurber came to New York in the
1920s (where he would forever mourn his failure to write the great
novel _ or any novel) and found himself compelled, instead, to pen
satire and scrawl scathing, libidinous cartoons, many of which
serve to this day as timeless dispatches from the battle of the
sexes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had no control over his environment,'' said Adam Van Doren,
whose hourlong video biography of Thurber (1894-1961) will be
broadcast Thursday, Jan. 6, at 10 p.m. on PBS. ``What writing did
was give him control. Writing was a way in which he could deal with
_ keep _ his sanity. He once said, `If I couldn't write, I couldn't
breathe.'''
</P>
<P>
   But he did write, almost to the very end of his life, curiously
ignoring the major issues of his time _ the Depression and World
War II _ and focusing instead on the fallout from the major issues
of his life: his pleasant but ineffectual father; his eccentric,
domineering mother (a frustrated actress); and the fools,
bureaucrats and lunatics who criss-crossed his consciousness each
day. Some read like fables, some like memoirs. All are reports from
a two-front conflict: Thurber vs. Thurber, and Thurber vs. the
world.
</P>
<P>
   In his documentary ``Thurber: The Life and Hard Times,'' Van
Doren seeks to capture his subject from a writer's perspective. He
has enlisted, among others, Edward Albee, Roy Blount Jr., Fran
Lebowitz, John Updike and his own grandfather the poet and critic
Mark Van Doren, a Thurber neighbor in Cornwall, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly these other famous writers are fans, even
cheerleaders, but they are also witnesses to or commentators on the
Thurber who was the Pagliacci of sophisticated American humor. In
their recollections, Thurber is the tortured man who struggled with
the gradual loss of his sight. The tall, urbane wit who could be a
nasty drunk. The Thurber who, in E.B. White's view, gave in to the
lure of televised celebrityhood in the 1950s, even as White
(Thurber's office mate and early writing mentor) debarked to the
insular safety of the Maine coast.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Van Doren took the title of his documentary from Thurber's
first book, ``My Life and Hard Times,'' an ironic name for a
collection of stories about Thurber's upbringing and family life in
sleepy Columbus before the First World War. Its opening piece is
among Thurber's best known, ``The Night the Bed Fell,'' an account
of various eccentric relatives and the catastrophes that never
quite materialize during one noisy, sleepless night in the Thurber
household.
</P>
<P>
   Dramatis personae: Briggs Beall, a cousin who shares Thurber's
bedroom and insists on being awakened every hour at night, lest he
die of suffocation. Aunt Sarah Shoaf, ``who never went to bed at
night without the fear that a burglar was going to get in and blow
chloroform under her door through a tube.'' Aunt Gracie Shoaf, who
threw shoes down the hallway at night to keep (nonexistent)
burglars at bay. And Grandfather, who was absent that tumultuous
night _ a godsend, since his sense of time and place ended with the
Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing really ever happens in a Thurber story,'' Van Doren
said. ``It's a tone he helped set in The New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what you do get is a wonderfully precise treatise on
behavior. Somehow Thurber really grabs people, and they don't
always know it. It's sort of like a slow-running stream
underground.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lebowitz and Updike describe coming to Thurber at an early
age. Ms. Lebowitz says she was 10 when she discovered ``My Life and
Hard Times'' in the library, secreted it behind her geography book
in class and eventually was thrown out for laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Van Doren, who is 37, says he, too, discovered Thurber in
childhood, but in a loftier library _ that of his grandfather, who
maintained a bookcase in Cornwall filled with volumes written by
friends and inscribed to him. Thurber's books were among them, his
signature growing larger and shakier as his eyesight failed. Adam
Van Doren said the cartoons of the uniquely doughy Thurber people
grabbed his interest first; then came the stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the cartoons, you can try to make sense of your chaotic
world and the world of your own family,'' he said. ``But here's the
significant thing about his writing. Thurber is two-pronged. He
hits you as a kid, and you might just leave him there. But he also
hits you as an adult.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A painter of watercolors who shares a studio on West 57th Street
with several other artists, Van Doren said the notion to proceed
with a Thurber documentary bubbled to the surface about four years
ago. Along the way he was able to rely on the memories and material
of Thurber's only child, Rosemary, who now lives in Michigan and is
the product of Thurber's first marriage, to an Ohio State
University sweetheart named Althea Adams. They divorced in the
early 1930s. Thurber's second wife, Helen Wismer, died in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   From all accounts, it was the failure of Thurber's first
marriage and a wrenching separation from his daughter that turned
him seriously to drink and to some of the darker, more
introspective pieces in his collections.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could be a repository of deep sadness,'' Van Doren said,
``and he could dig deep into this well. It was down there and he
could pull it out and he could level you with it. His desire to
create was so intense _ look at the drive to create, to publish
when you're blind.''
</P>
<P>
   The combination of hostility and humor was played out over and
over.
</P>
<P>
   In `Mr. ` Preble Gets Rid of His Wife,'' one of more than a
dozen scenes in ``A Thurber Carnival'' (the 1960 Broadway review
for which Thurber won a special Tony Award), Mr. Preble decides to
run off with his stenographer. But first he must do away with Mrs.
Preble, a formidable presence who eventually foils her husband's
murder plot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to bury you in the cellar,'' Mr. Preble says. ``I've
got my mind made up. I don't know how I could make it any
plainer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen,'' Mrs. Preble says, ``will you be satisfied and shut
up if I go down in the cellar? Can I have a little peace if I go
down in the cellar? Will you let me alone then?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, but you spoil it by taking that attitude,'' Mr. Preble
says.
</P>
<P>
   By and by, he reveals the shovel.
</P>
<P>
   ``What have you got there?'' Mrs. Preble asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to hit you over the head with this shovel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You were, huh? Well, get that out of your mind. Do you want to
leave a great big clue right here in the middle of everything where
the first detective that comes snooping around will find it? Go out
in the street and find some piece of iron or something.''
</P>
<P>
   For Mr. Preble, it's all downhill from there.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 20 years of his life, Thurber, who had lost his left
eye in a childhood accident, was reduced to seeing only light and
shadow in the right eye. He stopped drawing in 1950. Numerous
operations failed to help.
</P>
<P>
   It was after one of these, in 1941, that Mark Van Doren
encountered Thurber, at a party in Martha's Vineyard. Thurber asked
for a moment alone with Van Doren, which Van Doren describes on a
film clip that was part of a 1961 filmed conversation called
``Dialogues With Archibald MacLeish and Mark Van Doren.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So we went out _ I led him out _ and we found chairs and we
sat down, and I looked at him and he was weeping,'' Van Doren said.
``Tears were literally running down his face, and I said, `What's
the matter, Thurber?' He said: `This is a punishment. This
blindness is a punishment.' I said: `Why? What for? How could it be
a punishment?'
</P>
<P>
   ``He said: `Well, in my writings I have always dealt with
meanness and stupidity. My subject has never been goodness and
strength. I have always talked about poor, weak people. I made fun
of them. So this is punishment. I have been stricken blind.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of a man like that thinking such a thing,'' Van Doren
said. ``But he really did think it. Well, I had to think fast
myself. And I said what anyone might have said. I said: `You know,
Mr. Thurber, everyone who's ever read you knows that you are for
goodness and strength. But you deal with it in reverse, so to
speak. You are a satirist and you deal with the opposites of
goodness and strength in order to reveal your true belief.' He said
I'd saved his life.''

AN EMOTIONAL MISFIT IN A POSTMODERN WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Jan. 2)  
 (ART ADV: Photos of Doug Varone and other members of his dance
troupe are being sent to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers can
make individual purchase by calling (888) 603-1036 or (888)
346-9867.)  
 Joseph Carman's previous article for the New York Times' Sunday
Arts &AMP; Leisure section was about choreographer Paul Taylor.  
 (bl)  
 By JOSEPH CARMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is normal for artists to put themselves at the
center of their creations. But for choreographers who dance in
their own pieces, the process can be complicated. Martha Graham,
for example, whose technique and stylization were based on her own
physique and temperament, gave up choreographing for a number of
years when her body could no longer uphold her self-imposed
physical demands.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer burden of stepping in and out of the creative act can
also be problematic. Keeping a balance between the performing ego
and the demands of choreographing is an art in itself, and one that
has been carefully studied by Doug Varone, whose company will be at
the Joyce Theater from Tuesday through Sunday. Varone will present
five premieres during the week, a number made possible because he
doesn't insist on dancing in the bulk of his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past I've always found a way to put myself into a work
somehow,'' says Varone, who at 43 can still move with mercurial
speed and consume stage space voraciously. ``I'd wheedle myself
into the process, leave a hole or choreograph my part on someone
else. I'm not doing that any longer. I am at a place now where I
clearly make better work when I'm not in a piece.'' (He will
nonetheless dance in some of the works at the Joyce.)
</P>
<P>
   Varone danced in Jose Limon's company in the early stages of his
career, and Carla Maxwell, the artistic director of the Limon
company, notes certain similarities between the two choreographers.
In addition to a common attention to form, gesture, lush movement
and musicality, she says, ``It was Jose's sense of space and use of
people in space that really affected Doug as a young dancer and
made his mind churn as a choreographer.'' And by building on the
influence of Limon and Lar Lubovitch, for whom Varone danced until
1986, she says, ``Doug has developed a very wonderful and specific
style for himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Varone's greatest gift, however, is his understanding of
human nature and of how people work together as a group. ``The
Plain Sense of Things,'' which Ms. Maxwell invited Varone to
choreograph for the Limon company's fall season, uses the paintings
of Edward Hopper as an inspiration. Comprising four vignettes, the
work reveals intimate stories about the struggle of people to
connect. When it was presented by the Limon company on a triple
bill with Antony Tudor's ``Dark Elegies'' and Limon's ``There Is a
Time,'' a palpable dramatic thread was present.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had pieces from 1999, 1937 and 1956 by three very different
choreographers, and they each presented a community and a
situation,'' says Ms. Maxwell. ``They complemented each other so
well.''
</P>
<P>
   It is that concentration on the emotional resonance of movement
that has made Varone a standout, even a misfit, in the world of
postmodernists. (``What is postmodern anyway?'' he asks with a
spontaneous laugh.) If any label fits him, it is probably
``humanist.'' Part of his humanistic attitude allows Varone to
encourage his dancers to be part of the creative process. He has
kept his stable of nine dancers, some of whom have been with him
for 10 or more years, very much intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been really fortunate to have long-term relationships
with people in the company,'' Varone says. ``There was a period
when nobody was leaving. There was a great sense that we were there
together understanding the work, whatever that meant. When that
happens and you walk into a studio and something breaks loose, it's
because there is a great deal of trust in the room.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Trust is very much in evidence in one of Varone's latest
creations, ``Polonaise No. 44,'' which is taken directly from a
videotaped improvisation to a Chopin piano score created in a
gymnasium by Varone and Gwen Welliver, a member of the company
since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have built an artistic relationship over time,'' says Ms.
Welliver. In that particular duet, she says, ``I found that we
could make movement decisions and structural-composition decisions
very quickly together.'' Varone adds that improvisation at this
level rests on the ability ``to know how a piece of music builds
and how the physical score is going to match that, and then just
going along for the ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Other premieres at the Joyce include ``Agora,'' which Varone
choreographed before hearing the commissioned score by Julia Wolfe;
``Eclipse,'' a trio that Varone jokingly calls ``an episode from
`Melrose Place'''; and ``Tomorrow,'' an intimate and lyrical group
work to French love songs by Reynaldo Heyn, in which solos and
duets waft on- and offstage like ephemeral yet poignant memories.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest risk-taking project for Varone has been
``Sleeping With Giants,'' a work of brutal intensity with Larry
Hahn in the central role of a man whose usefulness and worth in
society are questioned, causing him to be made a scapegoat.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the work, danced to a clawing score by Michael Nyman,
Hahn is exhaustively dragged into a deadly human whirlpool,
circled, taunted, temporarily comforted and ultimately assaulted
and disposed of by the aggressive corps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about a community of people,'' says Hahn, who will turn
50 in May. ``Through time, I struggle to keep up, and situations
occur that I don't understand and I get lost. There seems to be
something understood and going on without me. It takes you to a
place that is pretty raw.''
</P>
<P>
   Varone admits that the new work has an autobiographical tone in
examining society's view of aging. ``I  &UR; do &LR;  want to call it the
aging process,'' he says. ``At 43, although I can still move
around, I'm slowing down, and that is something I'll never be able
to reverse. It is definitely about watching yourself in some way
 &UR; not &LR;  being able to keep up any longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Hahn adds: ``I think it is partly a reflection of Doug, but
possibly what he sees in me, too. The process of getting older and
not being able to keep up, because of my age.''
</P>
<P>
   Confronting the inevitable haunts dancers in the latter part of
their careers and is the central issue in a projected new movie
called ``Without a Word,'' which will star Patrick Swayze and his
wife, Lisa Nieme. The film, to be directed by Ms. Nieme, is being
choreographed in its preproduction stage by Varone and five other
choreographers from the contemporary dance world. The story focuses
on three dancers in midlife who return after five years of absence
to dance in a gala performance with their former modern-dance
company after the founding choreographer dies. Through the eyes of
the performers, a dance career becomes a metaphor for life,
reflecting a similar dramatic arc.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, they face their own personal demons to come back for
one last chance to rediscover a dream that they had left behind,''
Ms. Nieme says. ``They discover that the value in life is not
something outside. It doesn't lie with dance or whatever kind of
work you do. Any value comes from inside yourself. It's a spiritual
victory rather than a `Rocky' victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Swayze, who is also the producer of the film, emphasizes the
advantage of experienced dancers over what he calls the young
``techno-monsters.'' ``On a large scale,'' he says, ``the piece
really goes into just how much more informed your work as a dancer
can be when you're older.''
</P>
<P>
   Swayze said Varone is the perfect artist to express the film's
intent because of ``his humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You see a real human being on stage,'' he said. ``When he
tells a story, it's really through a very human body language. It's
not about the technical; it's about something coming from inside of
you. Doug can tell an emotional story with incredible subtlety.
That is what makes him a master.'' &QL;

COLONIALISM'S LATEST FOOTHOLD IN CUBA? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Jan. 2)  
 (bl)  
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA, Cuba _ The Milwaukee Symphony's recent mission to this
city looked different to different people. Was it a gift of musical
culture to the Cuban people? Well, Cuba has its own symphony
orchestras, and the players I came across were good indeed: lots of
technique, lots of style.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe if we close our eyes and imagine a colonial superpower
steaming across the Gulf of Mexico, bent on reinforcing a stranded
enclave of classical music, then the trip makes more sense. The
word ``colonial'' is big in Cuba, defining the island's long
history of occupation and exploitation. And classical music in Cuba
could, from this point of view, use a little rescuing.
</P>
<P>
   The breakup of the Soviet Union deprived Cubans not only of
heavy machinery and export credits but also of a link to Central
and East European musical tradition. Czech and Soviet teachers came
here to teach; Cubans went to them to study. Music education is big
in Cuban schools, but the instruments are 30 years old and in
disrepair.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Milwaukee concerts in Havana, the closest thing to an
American orchestra visiting here was a youth ensemble from New
England a year or so ago. So complex is the ritual of cultural
exchange that it has generated a whole new industry, namely
Canada-Cuba Sports and Cultural Festivals, with offices in Toronto
and Havana. This is not a sideline enterprise; it is based on Cuba
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Canadians have an easier time of it here: officially friends,
not enemies. Jonathan Watts, president of the company, reports that
officials here are no harder to deal with than any others but that
telephones and telecommunications are in bad shape. Canada-Cuba has
responded by building its own private network of phones, faxes and
e-mail, and hiring people here to run its office.
</P>
<P>
   Arts exchanges are only part of the business. The University of
Colorado sends archaeologists; the University of Wisconsin, nurses
and nursing know-how. Watts' worst Cuban-American experience was
the recent visit of the Baltimore Orioles. ``They tried to
politicize everything,'' he said. ``There was arguing whether Fidel
Castro would get the proceeds of the gates at baseball games. The
tickets were either free or cost 5 cents. This added up to about
$50.''
</P>
<P>
   One more way to describe Milwaukee in Havana is this: picture an
American orchestra with Liszt and Strauss as its imports and set it
against the much larger picture of musical Cuba as a whole. Anyone
who has succumbed to ``The Buena Vista Social Club'' _ either the
movie or the recording _ has to wonder whether we shouldn't be
listening to the Cuban popular tradition rather than Bernsteinian
syntheses of it in ``West Side Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the classical European tradition arriving by way of North
America is a marginal affectation. A more paranoid Cuban might find
here the latest colonialist plot to impose the will of foreigners
on local sensibilities. The divide between cultures is more vivid
in Cuba, given its recent isolation and its ethnic core heavily
based on the black slave population sent long ago to work the
country's lucrative sugar cane.
</P>
<P>
   Europe came to this island, and the genetic memory of that
coming survives. And, of course, any ``native'' music, with a
little historical digging, can be shredded into many musics, all of
them originally from somewhere else. But in the drums, bongos,
claves and maracas that underlie the Cuban music that one hears
performed in nearly every bar, restaurant and cafe, there is
something distinctive. The distance to Spain and Britain seems far,
and to Africa just a brief hop.
</P>
<P>
   Whose music is whose becomes more complicated in the United
States. German, Hungarian and Polish immigrants in the 19th century
didn't import classical music; they brought it with them. Maybe
European music has as much a proprietary claim to original
Americanness as the country's own black tradition. Or is the real
America in sound the beating drums and ritual whoops of Iroquois
and Sioux?
</P>
<P>
   The last argument may be in trouble. Recent anthropological
musings suggest that some form of Caucasian may have beat the
Indian to America after all, a possibility that sits uneasily with
tribal lawyers suing for the return of, or compensation for,
confiscated lands. For who knows from whom, if anybody, tribes got
their territory in the first place? Did some prehistoric Bach once
sound through the canyons of New Mexico? To anyone interested in
the question of aborigine and interloper, I suggest ``The Enigma of
Arrival'' by V.S. Naipul.
</P>
<P>
   Similar questions can be argued in the public spaces of Havana,
all teeming with live popular music. Trios and quartets of
guitarists and singers seem to go with every place that sells a
drink or food to eat. My bus passed by a big curbside band
including oboes and a cello; I wish I had heard them play. Next to
the gritty intricacy of ``The Buena Vista Social Club,'' most of
these musicians seem bland. Rhythmic complication is smoothed out;
the rough edges of singing style are sandpapered clean. But the
basic impulses of Cuban music are there to be heard.
</P>
<P>
   The Milwaukee Symphony did have its grateful audience of
conservatory students, older music lovers and children, but with
the incessant hum of another music all around it, the image of a
small and isolated enclave was not far off. Liszt and Strauss
played by a major orchestra made a nice change, but the next
important music of this world may arrive not by way of New York or
Vienna concert halls but from the streets of Latin America.(BOX)

COWARD'S `WINGS' NEVER GETS OFF THE GROUND

 By VINCENT CANBY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Describing Dublin, where his new comedy, ``Waiting in
the Wings,'' was trying out before making its way to London, Noel
Coward wrote in his journal of Aug. 21, 1960: ``There is an
atmosphere of amiable retrogressiveness about everything and
everyone which, for a little while, is curiously attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   Amiable retrogressiveness?
</P>
<P>
   What a deliberately lethal, if polite, way to characterize a
place that is picturesque in the extreme, and which you don't mind
visiting _ briefly _ as long as your notices are flattering and the
box office is good. It is also a practically perfect way to
describe the first Broadway production of ``Waiting in the Wings.''
As things turned out, the London critics treated the play rather
sternly, which is one reason it is only now having its New York
premiere.
</P>
<P>
   The production, directed by Michael Langham, is at the Walter
Kerr Theater, with a big, spangly cast headed by Lauren Bacall and
Rosemary Harris. Yet the occasion is of somewhat less interest
theatrically than historically. It is the only Broadway production
to suggest that Dec. 16, 1999 (the night this production opened),
is a date to celebrate, it being the centenary of Coward's birth.
</P>
<P>
   You might think that Broadway could have come up with something
a bit more impressive to honor the Coward career. He and heaven
know that he deserves our attention: playwright, actor, director,
singer, composer, lyricist, entertainer, a man who knew how to live
well, how to collect and keep friends, whose work has somehow
helped to illuminate and make bearable much of this century.
</P>
<P>
   In one way and another, he infiltrated the minds of generations
of sophisticates, genuine and would-be. Is there anyone of a
certain age who doesn't have buried deep in his subconscious a
lyric from ``Mad Dogs and Englishmen,'' or maybe a cryptic exchange
from ``Private Lives,'' possibly the one about China?
</P>
<P>
   You might think Broadway would have been able to mark Coward's
contributions to our melting civilization with something a bit more
stylish than ``Waiting in the Wings.'' A good deal happier and more
in the spirit with which we think of Coward was the entertaining
concert version of his musical ``Sail Away,'' starring Elaine
Stritch, which played 10 performances at Weill Recital Hall in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled to open at the Lucille Lortel later in the season is
``Suite in Two Keys,'' a program of two short Coward plays,
``Shadows of the Evening'' and ``A Song at Twilight.'' This is the
slightly pared down version of ``Suite in Three Keys,'' three short
plays in which Coward made his last London stage appearance in
1966.
</P>
<P>
   Of particular interest is ``A Song at Twilight,'' whose central
character (according to Coward) was inspired both by Max Beerbohm
and W. Somerset Maugham. This fellow is a bitchy, aging, successful
novelist who is suddenly forced to acknowledge his homosexuality,
also to consider how his closeted existence has stunted his work
and warped his relations with those he loved.
</P>
<P>
   As it appears to have been when it made its debut in London
nearly 40 years ago, ``Waiting in the Wings'' is an unredeemably
foolish play. The script for this production has been ``revisited''
by Jeremy Sams, the translator and director, though it still seems
as out of touch with the world of the 1960's (the time in which it
is placed) as it is with the world of today. It is neither clumsy
nor mechanically inept, but it is so clueless that it seems like a
setting in which Miss Marple will soon show up to solve a genteel
murder that has yet to be discovered. We are in the England of the
picturesque and the fatuous, positively sloshed on amiable
retrogressiveness.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the setting is the Wings, a country home for retired
actresses in need. They are, supposedly, aging actresses, but those
we see don't seem to be so old that they would be ready to turn
their backs on real life, which is what the residents of the Wings
have done. The only way the play makes sense is as a sort of
service comedy about actresses who might have been on the stage
before World War I, before the dominance of movies and television,
when theater was far less elite than it became after the Second
World War.
</P>
<P>
   As in a service comedy, each supporting character tends to be a
type, which is a kind way of saying that each is a cliche. What
plot there is revolves around the longstanding feud between May
Davenport (Ms. Harris) and Lotta Bainbridge (Ms. Bacall), each of
whom, you assume, was once a star of some fame, if only because the
roles are being played by stars. The feud began when Lotta lured
May's husband away from hearth and home. Toward the end of the
play, the situation is resolved with a minimum of fuss and a
certain amount of actressy sighing, separated by pauses.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Ms. Bacall nor Ms. Harris is going to win any awards for
her work here, mostly because there is nothing much to act. Ms.
Bacall, as we know, is good at sarcasm, and Ms. Harris can elocute
with the best of them. This they do as required. The supporting
roles, being shorter, are more vividly written and are decently
handled by Helena Carroll, Helen Stenborg, Elizabeth Wilson, Dana
Ivey and Barnard Hughes, among others.

   The cast is huge, numbering 18 people, and when Coward brings on
a lot of characters, he writes thin. Most of ``Waiting in the
Wings'' is simply anecdotal, having to do with the appearance of a
pushy newspaper reporter, a small fire, attempts to get the
management to build a solarium, and the celebration of New Year's
Eve.
</P>
<P>
   There are also jokes about the vanity of actresses, which
members of the public always appreciate since it makes them feel
privy to inside information. There is even a geography joke that
sounds like the last gasp of the man who wrote ``Private Lives'':
``Do you know Toronto?'' ``No.'' ``It's terribly Canadian.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared with New York, London has been awash in Coward revivals
during the last 12 months, including ``Private Lives,'' ``Hay
Fever'' and something that sounds especially promising, a
production of ``A Song at Twilight'' with Corin and Vanessa
Redgrave and Kika Markham.
</P>
<P>
   Coward was very proud of his propaganda work during World War
II, especially of his film, ``In Which We Serve,'' a patriotic tale
of the Royal Navy based on the experiences of his good friend, Lord
Louis Mountbatten. After the war, he expected that his various
endeavors would earn him a place on the king's honors list.
However, influential members of the postwar governments, including
Winston Churchill, continued to take a dim view of the
homosexuality that Coward, while remaining discreet, didn't try to
hide.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't receive his knighthood until 1970, just three years
before his death. Since then, however, the royals haven't been
stingy with their time in promoting Coward and, of course, the
commercial commodity he is for Britain. The Queen Mother, whom
Coward introduced to the joys of bullshots, unveiled Angela
Conner's life-size bronze statue of Coward when it was installed at
the Drury Lane Theater in London in late 1997. Prince Edward did
the duty when a cast of the same statue was placed in the Gershwin
Theater in New York last March, and the Duke of Gloucester was on
hand to officiate when, this fall, the work was placed on a
hillside at Firefly, Coward's Jamaican retreat.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the queen could step in and suggest that someone send this
former colony a first-rate production of one of the classic Coward
plays.
</P>
<P>
   `Fully Committed'
</P>
<P>
   Trendiness is to Manhattan what Lyme disease is to the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   About the only way to avoid it is to stay home with the shades
drawn, the television and radio unplugged, the phones dismembered,
all magazines and newspapers forbidden, reading the collected works
of Cotton Mather by candlelight. This is more or less the hilarious
_ and I mean seriously funny _ point of ``Fully Committed,'' the
brilliant off-Broadway comedy that has moved to the Cherry Lane
Theater after a limited run last year at the Vineyard Theater.
</P>
<P>
   The play, written by Becky Mode, stars Mark Setlock as a
commonsensical young man named Sam, who sits in a grubby basement
office answering three telephones and an intercom, juggling phone
reservations and other crises at this month's ``in'' Manhattan
restaurant. Here is a universe in which God is just another
celebrity. Setlock, being the only person in the cast, also plays
39 other hysterical characters created by him and Ms. Mode.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Martin, who directed Mary Louise Wilson and Mark
Hampton's ``Full Gallop,'' the one-woman show in which Ms. Wilson
played Diana Vreeland, is also the director of ``Fully Committed.''
In view of his excellent work as the director of Christopher
Durang's ``Betty's Summer Vacation'' at Playwrights Horizons and
George Bernard Shaw's ``You Never Can Tell'' at the Roundabout, it
is obvious his talents aren't limited to single-person plays.
</P>
<P>
   The joy of ``Fully Committed'' comes not only from the rich
quirkiness of the material, but also from the surprising ease of
the performance. One wizardly man creates a world more crowded with
character and life than you might find in a conventional theatrical
presentation on the order of, say, ``Waiting in the Wings.''
</P>
<P>
   Setlock slips from one character to the next with the speed of
light for priceless results. Here is a gallery of upwardly mobile
rogues, con artists, nouveau riche business types, bewildered
tourists, celebrity groupies, emotionally unpredictable chefs,
pushy socialites, prima donna maitre d's and others. The script
drops real-life names among the fictitious ones with such abandon
that, as you try to keep up, you feel as besieged as the person
dealing with the calls.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the show is more than an extended revue sketch. This is real
theater, a charming comedy with a beginning, middle and end.
</P>
<P>
   `Dinner With Friends'
</P>
<P>
   Donald Margulies' ``Dinner With Friends,'' at the Variety Arts,
is something you rarely find these days: a comedy about
heterosexual relationships that is neither embarrassed by nor smug
about its liberal, upper-middle-class values.
</P>
<P>
   It is sober, wise and sometimes extremely funny as Gabe (Matthew
Arkin) and Karen (Lisa Emery), now in their 40s, saddled with
children, mortgages and all the other trappings of suburban
marriage, attempt to cope with the panic they experience when their
best friends, Tom (Kevin Kilner) and Beth (Julie White), announce
they are splitting up.
</P>
<P>
   Gabe and Karen feel responsible. After all, they introduced Tom
and Beth. They are also at that point in their lives when they
suddenly realize that the unexamined marriage just might be the
marriage that no longer works.
</P>
<P>
   Margulies writes with elegance and wit about intimacy, trust,
privacy, and the toll of time and monogamy on sexual passion,
matters that aren't easily expressed in dramatic dialogue without
suggesting an animated self-help book. These are minutely observed,
recognizable folk, not sitcom types.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dinner With Friends,'' directed by Daniel Sullivan, is nicely
acted by the four cast members and aptly situated in Neil Patel's
sets that, like Margulies' text, suggest an innate connection to a
particular place and time without blaming the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   WAITING IN THE WINGS _ Why didn't Broadway celebrate Noel Coward
with one of his stylish classics?
</P>
<P>
   FULLY COMMITTED _ Mark Setlock and Becky Mode's brilliant
restaurant riff sets up a universe in which God is just another
celebrity.
</P>

TWINS WHO ALSO SHARE AN ENIGMATIC VISION

Modernism in Contemporary Art.''

<P>
   LONDON _ At a recent exhibition of the work of the neo-Classical
architect Sir John Soane at the Royal Academy here, the video
artists Jane and Louise Wilson were especially taken by a
watercolor of the Bank of England in ruins. Here was a Soane work
envisioned as a relic of the past rather than a project for the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Their fascination with this image sheds a revealing light on the
work of this team of 32-year-old twin sisters. They are best known
for a pair of room-encompassing four-channel video-projection works
filmed in abandoned outposts of Cold War Europe: the headquarters
of the East German secret police in Berlin and the U.S. missile
base at Greenham Common, England. These are projections of a
hallucinated architecture, the obsessively patient reconstruction
of ruins. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By that account, their newest work, ``Las Vegas, Graveyard
Time,'' might seem a departure. But the two casinos where much of
it was filmed, Caesars Palace and the Desert Inn, are already
relics to some extent, their kitsch decor rendered passe by the
family-style respectability of newer casinos like the Bellagio. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Las Vegas, Graveyard Time'' is currently on view at the Tate
Gallery here. It is part of an exhibition of works by the Wilsons,
who were nominated for the 1999 Turner Prize, which was won by
another video and film artist, Steve McQueen.
</P>
<P>
   Initiated in 1984 and nominally intended to honor a British
artist under 50 for an outstanding exhibition during the preceding
year, the Turner has been seen, at least since its award to Damien
Hirst in 1995, as conferring something approaching pop-star status.
As Jane Wilson remarked not long after the 1998 prize had gone to
Chris Ofili: ``I don't know how he can stand it. Sure, it's a great
thing that he won, but the Turner Prize puts such a terrible
pressure on a young artist.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is hard not to imagine the Wilsons' being disappointed at
missing out on the prize (and the $32,000 that goes with it), but
they have seen plenty of pressure over the last year anyway.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time that they were finishing ``Las Vegas, Graveyard
Time'' on a rush schedule, to have it ready for the opening of the
show at the Tate on Oct. 20, they were also preparing for their
first big museum exhibition, at the Serpentine Gallery here in
September and October. The Serpentine show included an equally
ambitious new work, ``Parliament,'' which was filmed last summer
when the Houses of Lords and Commons were in recess. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, they're scared out of their minds,'' Lisa Corrin,
the curator of the exhibition at the Serpentine, confided as the
Wilsons looked after last-minute details the day before the Tate
opening. ``They're up to their eyeballs in details. They've even
got their mother in from Newcastle to look after them.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jane is the short-haired, outgoing twin, Louise the quieter,
longer-haired one. They have cultivated a look that plays down
their resemblance, though they clearly know how to use their
twinhood for effect: having decided to go to art school in
different parts of Britain (Jane in Newcastle, Louise in Dundee),
they collaborated on a single work for their senior-thesis shows.
They then went on to study together for their master's degrees at
Goldsmiths College, London, the breeding ground for much of the
attention-getting new art that has come out of London in the '90s.
Now they live together in the working-class Brixton neighborhood of
South London, with a studio in Bermondsey, just below the Thames. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Ofili, whose spirited collage-paintings are reminiscent
of folk art and psychedelia, or Tracy Emin, another of this year's
Turner nominees, the Wilsons are not part of the ``Sensation''
exhibition of new British art at the Brooklyn Museum, the show that
brought Ofili notoriety for his painting ``The Holy Virgin Mary.''
Along with McQueen and a number of other young English artists who
are drawing increasing attention, like Tacita Dean, one of last
year's Turner nominees, they represent a very different strand in
current British art, one that is perhaps more European in outlook
than specifically English.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The works in ``Sensation'' were drawn from the collection of
Charles Saatchi, London's most prominent and omnivorous art
collector. The artists most strongly associated with Saatchi's
taste, among whom Hirst is the most notorious, use sculpture and
painting to convey imagery that demands a visceral response; in
this art, the complex critical moment may have more to do with
examining one's own reactions to an object than with the object's
formal elaboration.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Artists like the Wilsons, McQueen and Ms. Dean, by contrast,
work primarily with film and video (although all of them avail
themselves of sculpture, photography and other media as well) to
create work that may be equally concerned with emotionally laden
public issues, but that engages them in a slower, subtler, more
rigorously formalized way. (Although Saatchi's collection is
otherwise broad, he has not so far shown much interest in video.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Stasi City'' (1997) was the work that marked the Wilsons'
arrival as more than just promising. By successfully taking on a
site like the former East German secret-police headquarters, the
Wilsons announced that they were ready to move on from the quirky,
personal subject matter so typical of video work by young artists
and engage with capital-H history. But not in a didactic spirit, or
in the manner of a documentary. All the fears and anxieties of the
Cold War are there, certainly, but kept at a distance by a rigorous
structure that shows them only in glimpses, like the faceless
uniformed figures who occasionally pass through, conspicuous but
enigmatic, ``like fading wisps of a dream when one awakens,'' as
the critic Peter Schjeldahl writes in the exhibition catalog for
the Serpentine. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Their next work, ``Gamma'' (1999), was a companion piece to
``Stasi City,'' filmed in a Western landmark of the Cold War as the
earlier piece was in one of its Eastern outposts _ both of them now
abandoned. More than that, it perfected the method that ``Stasi
City'' had brilliantly adumbrated, with its spooky atmosphere
reminiscent of science fiction and horror movies.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both works are four-channel, floor-to-ceiling video projections,
creating a virtual architecture surrounding the viewer, which means
that there is never a position from which all four screens are
visible simultaneously. The camera restlessly roves deserted
spaces, revealing resonant details without dwelling on them. The
relentlessly mobile, anonymous viewpoint becomes as much the works'
subject as the places being explored. There is no dialogue or
voice-over to frame these details, only eerie sounds of machinery
and echoing footsteps, sounds that sometimes make viewers whirl
around to catch something that sounds as if it had just happened
behind them.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Photographs from ``Gamma'' are currently being exhibited at the
Carnegie International in Pittsburgh. Other United States
exhibitions of the Wilsons' work are scheduled at the 303 Gallery
in New York in September and at the List Visual Arts Center at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology next January. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The new work at the Serpentine, ``Parliament,'' showed a
continuation of the Wilsons' interest in working with politically
charged spaces. Maybe that's why ``Las Vegas, Graveyard Time'' came
as so much of a surprise. But there are similarities between the
two works.
</P>
<P>
   Just as ``Parliament'' fuses parts of two distinct places,
Commons and Lords, into a fictional ``third house,'' as Jane calls
it, ``Las Vegas'' combines two casinos, along with corridors in the
interior of the nearby Hoover Dam, into a single
psycho-architectural experience. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As Jane points out, while the other three works are built around
horizontal and vertical camera movements, ``Las Vegas, Graveyard
Time'' makes extensive use of circular camera movements. ``There
are more pans,'' she says, ``like the motion of the roulette wheel.
The whole point of the way the casinos are designed is keeping you
there _ creating an enclosed mental space with no outside. It's
like hypnotism, which was the subject of one of our earliest
videotapes. And like the cinema, too.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Wilsons may be fascinated by cinema's power to hypnotize, to
pin its viewers down to a single spot, but the form of their
installations is meant to resist it at the same time. ``The
four-screen setup implicates you more, makes you less passive,''
Jane says. Louise adds, ``It's more like the way you move around
sculpture.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jane continues: ``When cinema first began it was very
experimental. A lot of that's been lost, but you can experience
things in a much more physical, engaged way.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean the Wilsons see their work (which is shot on
film, though displayed as video) as closer to cinema than to art?
``No,'' they both insist at once, but then Louise distinguishes
their work from most other video art by adding, ``Our production
values are attempting to be as good as cinema.'' Maybe that's why
critics who write about their work follow the artists themselves in
invoking filmmakers like Andrei Tarkovsky or Dziga Vertov as
predecessors, rather than video artists like Bruce Nauman or Joan
Jonas. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Las Vegas, Graveyard Time'' imposes its own brand of austere,
melancholy grandeur on the town least likely to want it. While
video installations have become art-world darlings _ thanks to
their ability to bring museums closer to the ethos of popular
culture, to make them feel more like places of entertainment _ the
Wilsons lend the genre something more like the near-abstraction and
gravitas of high modernist films like Alain Resnais' ``Last Year at
Marienbad.'' But in their work, as in that of McQueen and Ms. Dean,
both strands, cinema and video art, are equally present. And that's
part of what gives it its special strength, as well as its blend of
accessibility and artistic reflexivity. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The neon sign in front of the Vivian Beaumont Theater
at Lincoln Center calls Michael John LaChiusa's ``Marie Christine''
``a new musical.'' So do all the posters. Whether or not LaChiusa
specifically requested that the show be advertised in this way,
there can be little doubt that he approves, since he recently wrote
an essay for The New York Times' Sunday Arts &AMP; Leisure section in
which he firmly stated that ``Marie Christine'' was a musical, not
an opera.
</P>
<P>
   LaChiusa can call ``Marie Christine'' anything he wants: it's
his show. But I have seen it twice, one time with Audra McDonald in
the title role and the other with her alternate, Sherry Boone
(whose first-rate performance, incidentally, disproved the
widespread notion that ``Marie Christine'' is nothing without its
star). On both occasions, I came away certain that it was an opera
_ and that the author's claims to the contrary were doing him a
disservice.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, neither genre is easy to define. Though ``Tristan
und Isolde'' is definitely an opera and ``Annie Get Your Gun'' a
musical, much of what comes in between is up for grabs. French
opera-comique and German Singspiel, for example, both have spoken
dialogue and songlike arias. Oscar Hammerstein II rewrote the
libretto of ``Carmen,'' the quintessential opera-comique, and
successfully brought it to Broadway as ``Carmen Jones''; LaChiusa
himself sees ``The Magic Flute,'' a Singspiel generally regarded as
among the highest and most profound expressions of the operatic
ideal, as a ``prototype'' for the modern musical.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Carmen'' and ``The Magic Flute,'' different though they
are from ``Tristan,'' also have something essential in common with
it: they are  &UR; scores &LR; , unified musico-dramatic structures whose
separate parts serve a larger theatrical end. ``Annie Get Your
Gun,'' by contrast, is a play with free-standing songs, nearly all
of which can be sung on their own. And while the arias of Bizet and
Mozart are fully as hummable as Irving Berlin's songs, they aspire
to a higher level of technical sophistication and emotional
intensity.
</P>
<P>
   What about ``Marie Christine''? My guess is that about
two-thirds of it is sung, and much of the spoken dialogue is
accompanied by the orchestra. Of the 35 musical numbers, only one,
``Way Back to Paradise,'' is a self-contained song that ends with a
clean break for applause. The harmonic language is often quite
dissonant, at least by the prevailing standards of American popular
music. And as if all that weren't enough to give the game away,
``Marie Christine'' is a tragedy without a trace of Hammersteinian
uplift. (As Bugs Bunny says in ``What's Opera, Doc?,'' ``What didja
expect in an opera _ a happy ending?'')
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, is LaChiusa unwilling to call his creation by its
right name? Because he doesn't  &UR; want &LR;  it to be an opera. In his
essay, he claims that opera is ``elitist'' and unrepresentative of
America's ``mongrel culture.'' He goes so far as to define opera as
``what Europeans used to write'' (except, presumably, for Mozart).
But he is tilting at a straw man. His main objection to the genre
turns out to be that ``the `pure' sound that classically trained
American singers strive for is essentially Eurocentric.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's blasphemy to even suggest it,'' he added, ``but why can't
opera singers combine vocal styles?'' The answer, of course, is
that many of the younger ones _ Bryn Terfel, Anne Sofie von Otter,
Sylvia McNair and Dawn Upshaw among them _ have been doing it for
years. Ms. McDonald is a classically trained soprano whose method
of vocal production is ``Eurocentric,'' yet it doesn't stop her
from singing LaChiusa's bluesy melodies with thrilling conviction.
</P>
<P>
   The key word here is ``elitist.'' LaChiusa, who admits to having
had to pawn his piano after writing ``Marie Christine,'' clearly
longs to be popular. Alas, he longs in vain. Broadway today is
about ``Beauty and the Beast'' and ``Footloose,'' not complex
scores that demand your full attention at all times.
</P>
<P>
   To call ``Marie Christine'' a musical is implicitly to claim
that it has more in common with these simple-minded shows than
``Carmen.'' Not only is this untrue, it's bad marketing, the
equivalent of a bait-and-switch scam. Labels are unfashionable
these days, even politically incorrect, but sometimes they still
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Had ``Marie Christine'' been billed as ``a new opera'' and
produced by, say, Glimmerglass Opera, it would have drawn a
different, more adventurous kind of audience, one better prepared
to grapple with its challenging blend of pop-flavored rhythms and
prickly harmonies.
</P>
<P>
   LaChiusa is not the only opera composer who insists that he's
writing musicals. Stephen Sondheim continues to do the same thing,
ignoring the increasingly obvious fact that his best work belongs
in opera houses. Chicago's Lyric Opera recently announced that it
would produce ``Sweeney Todd'' in 2002, with Bryn Terfel in the
title role. I couldn't be happier; I think it's one of the finest
operas composed by an American. So is Adam Guettel's ``Floyd
Collins,'' a post-Sondheim show whose expressive ambitions place it
far beyond the constricting ambit of the contemporary musical. And
so is ``Porgy and Bess,'' a masterpiece that never truly came to
life until opera companies embraced it.
</P>
<P>
   Is ``Marie Christine'' worthy of being produced alongside these
works? I believe so _ but we'll never know for sure until Michael
John LaChiusa shakes off his morbid fear of being branded an
elitist and allows it to be marketed as the excellent opera that it
is.
