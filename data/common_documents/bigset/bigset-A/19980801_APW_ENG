	   WINDSOR, Ontario (AP) _ Pat Hurst made six straight birdies
Friday in the du Maurier Classic and quietly served noticed that Se
Ri Pak isn't the only woman capable of winning two major
championships this year.
	   Hurst, who won her first major in the Dinah Shore in March, shot
a 7-under-par 65 and shared the lead with Brandie Burton after two
rounds of the lowest scoring in LPGA major championship history.
	   Burton, whose birdie-eagle finish gave her a 64, and Hurst were
at 132. They were one stroke ahead of Betsy King going into the
weekend, with Annika Sorenstam and Meg Mallon another stroke back
at 134.
	   While big galleries and big expectations followed Pak in her bid
to win a third straight major, Hurst made one putt after another
with only about 100 people looking on.
	   That didn't seem to bother the 28-year-old Hurst, whose victory
in the Dinah Shore has been all but forgetten in the euphoria over
Pak.
	   ``You can't take that away from me, and you can't take away from
what Se Ri has done,'' Hurst said. ``What she's done the last five
weeks has been unbelievable.
	   ``I'm just quietly going along, and that's the way I like it.''
	   Pak, trying to become the first woman since Pat Bradley in 1986
to win three majors in a season and the first golfer since Ben
Hogan in 1953 to win three in a row, played another lackluster
round _ a 2-under 70 that left her seven strokes off the lead.
	   ``My game not good, but not bad,'' Pak said. ``Maybe tomorrow or
Sunday I can find solid shot. I have two days left. I have
chance.''
	   Her 5-under 139 through two rounds wasn't nearly enough to keep
pace with the leaders, who had few problems at the Essex Golf and
Country Club on a sunny, sometimes breezy day.
	   ``I think there are a lot of people who can still win the golf
tournament,'' said King, who lacks only the du Maurier for the
LPGA's career grand slam. ``It might take 20-under the way things
look now.''
	   Tammie Green was among those at 9-under 135. Laura Davies worked
herself back into contention with a 67 that left her at 136, along
with Dottie Pepper and Helen Alfredsson.
	   ``I don't think you can sharpen this course's teeth too much,''
Davies said. ``Ten-under at a major is usually leading by 10
strokes.''
	   The cut was 2-under 142, the lowest ever for an LPGA major. The
previous record was 1-over 145 in the 1987 LPGA Championship. The
lowest cut for any LPGA Tour event was 3-under 141 in the State
Farm Rail Classic last year at Springfield, Ill.
	   Among those who missed the cut were Bradley, Kelly Robbins and
defending champion Colleen Walker.
	   ``The course is playing a little shorter than a major like the
U.S. Open,'' Hurst said. ``The greens are true, but when you have a
lot of wedges and 9-irons into greens, you will have birdie
opportunities.''
	   No one took more advantage than Hurst.
	   It started with a 6-iron into eight feet for birdie at the par-3
fifth hole. She holed putts on the next two holes, dropped in a
40-footer (12 meters) on No. 8 and then two-putted from 35 feet (10
1/2-meter) at the par-5 ninth.
	   She closed out the best string of birdies in her career with a
15-footer (4 1/2 meters) on No. 10.
	   ``It seemed like the hole was a big garbage can collecting
everything, which was fine by me,'' she said.
	   Burton made three straight birdies to get to 9-under, but then
settled into a routine of nine straight pars _ great for a U.S.
Open, but a sure way to lose ground in the du Maurier.
	   She finished in style, making a birdie putt on No. 8, her 17th
hole of the day. She hit a 4-wood into 30 feet (9 meters) and made
that for eagle at the 450-yard (410-meter) ninth, the easiest hole
on the course.
	   ``I kind of came through a lull in the middle of my round for a
good finish,'' Burton said.
	   Thirty-four players were within six strokes of the lead going
into a weekend that could turn into a shootout, depending on
whether the wind kicks up off the Detroit River, or whether the
leaders falter.

	   YAITEPEC, Mexico (AP) _ Members of a leftist opposition party
engaged in a brief shootout with ruling-party supporters in
southern Oaxaca state just two days before gubernatorial elections
there. Three policemen were wounded in the confrontation.
	   The three policemen were ambushed, said state officials, who
offered no information on the condition of the wounded.
	   The shootout occurred Friday about 70 miles (113 kilometers)
south of Oaxaca City in the village of Yaitepec, where
politically-motivated violence has occurred in past elections. The
village was gripped by a three-day running gun battle between local
activists during mayoral elections in 1995.

Heavy rain kills people in South Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Two days of torrential rains washed
away roads, triggered landslides and submerged homes, killing at
least 14 people and leaving dozens more missing, disaster relief
headquarters said Saturday.
	   Most of the missing people were swept away by the sudden rise in
water levels in mountain valleys in southern South Korea.
	   Hundreds of mountain campers remained stranded. Helicopters and
rescuers struggled to reach them but were hampered by heavy rain
and streams swollen with flood water. Disaster officials feared the
casualty figures could rise as communications with remote areas are
restored.
	   Kang Byung-ho, 38, and three family members were crushed to
death when their home collapsed under a landslide. Villagers pulled
up the body of a baby girl floating in flood water.
	   Up to 25 centimeters (10 inches) of rain poured down in the
southern provinces overnight. Weather forecasters failed to predict
the heavy rains and many summer vacationers in mountains and rivers
were caught unprepared.
	   Two airports were closed due to slick runways. Train services
were halted in the southwestern Cholla province when a landslide
triggered by flash floods covered 30 meters (yards) of rail.
	   Ferry routes also halted operations and vacationers were
evacuated from beaches as weather officials issued storm warnings
along the coasts.
	   Police also reported a sharp increase in traffic accidents on
the nation's rain-drenched highways. In one accident, a bus skidded
off the road and overturned, injuring 30 passengers.
	   At least 100 homes remained underwater, leaving 300 people
homeless, officials said.
	   Gen. Kim Dong-shin, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
ordered the military to provide manpower and machinery to help
relief operations.
	   Weather officials expected more rain in the southern provinces
until late Sunday.

Australia hands New Zealand third straight loss to clinch series
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP) _ Australia beat New Zealand
27-23 Saturday to clinch the Bledisloe Cup, emblematic of rugby
union supremacy between the two countries.
	   The win in the Tri Nations test match was the first for
Australia at Lancaster Park in 40 years. Australia had not won a
rugby union test in New Zealand since 1990.
	   New Zealand scored two late tries _ from Christian Cullen and
Jonah Lomu _ to make the finish close in a match that Australia
dominated throughout. It was the All Blacks' third consecutive
loss, the first time they've lost three in a row since 1949.
	   ``We had a game plan and we stuck to it for most of the match,''
said Australian captain John Eales. ``It's too bad about the two
late tries but we came here to win the Bledisloe Cup and we did
it.''
	   Australia, which beat New Zealand 24-16 at Melbourne on July 11,
clinched the three-match series with a match to play in Sydney
later this month. The Wallabies had not won the Bledisloe Cup since
taking a on-off test in Sydney in 1994.
	   The win moved Australia into the lead in the Tri Nations series
with a match to be played against second-place South Africa in
Johannesburg on Aug. 22. New Zealand closes out the series a week
earlier in Durban against South Africa.
	   The Wallabies led 10-3 at halftime having scored two tries to
none, the only All Black score from a penalty goal to five-eighth
Andrew Mehrtens.
	   Second-rower Tom Bowman scored his first test try after six
minutes and fullback Matthew Burke crossed with just over a minute
left in a dominant Australian performance.
	   The Wallabies also produced some gusty defensive efforts when
they constantly crash-tackled All Blacks in their own quarter
during a 10-minute period late in the half when New Zealand
threatened a comeback.
	   But Australia soaked up the pressure until conceding an offside
penalty which Mehrtens converted to bring the margin back to two
points.
	   The Wallabies reversed the pressure, however, with an incredible
string of phases which led to Burke diving over in the corner.
	   Bowman scored after six minutes when he completed the second of
two big early charges, stumbling through some weak All Black
defense.
	   Scores:
	   AUSTRALIA 27 (Tom Bowman, Matthew Burke, Jason Little, Stephen
Larkham tries; John Eales 2 conversions, Matthew Burke penalty)
def. NEW ZEALAND 23 (Christian Cullen, Jonah Lomu tries; Andrew
Mehrtens 2 conversions, 3 penalties). (djp)

American men swimmers defeated by World All-Stars
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with men's skating, boxing. &QL; 
 &UR; By BILL BARNARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ For U.S. men's swimming, it's never
been this bad.
	   Even when American women struggled in the pool with the rise of
East Germany in the 1970s and China in the '90s, the guys always
found a way to win more than their share.
	   With the Olympics coming up in two years, it looks now like the
men's team has a long way to go to catch up with the women, who are
undefeated in two Goodwill Games dual meets. The men are 0-2 after
a 78-43 thrashing by a World All-Star team Friday night.
	   ``I saw my mom in the stands and she made eye contact with me
and said, `Good job,''' said Bill Pilczuk of Auburn, Alabama, a
world champion this year in the 50-meter freestyle, but third to
two World teamers. ``I just rolled my eyes and said `Sheesh.'''
	   Wednesday's loss to Germany was painful. This time, the defeat
was downright embarrassing, with six 1-2 sweeps by the World team
in 12 individual events.
	   ``Americans come in to win every race, every day,'' said Josh
Davis of San Antonio, one of the few U.S. winners. ``Wednesday was
just a bad day in the office. It was an off day. We pride ourselves
on having one of the strongest swimming programs.''
	   The Americans, who lost to Germany on the final race, the
400-meter freestyle relay _ an event they've won at every Olympics
_ started OK against the World team by winning the 400 medley relay
for a 7-0 lead.
	   But the World team then went 1-2 in five of the next seven
events for a 46-24 lead that the Americans never challenged. Among
the sweeps was in the 50 freestyle, where Pilczuk finished third
behind Lorenzo Vismara of Italy and Ricardo Busquets of Puerto
Rico.
	   ``I would've liked to have another meet where it came down to
the free relay, but it didn't work out that way,'' U.S. men's coach
Bill Wadley said.
	   U.S. men traditionally included a wealth of speedy freestylers,
but the embarrassment in the sprints continued with another World
sweep in the 100.
	   Fernando Scherer of Brazil became the fourth man in history to
break 49 seconds in the event, joining Americans Matt Biondi and
Gary Hall Jr., and Russian Aleksandr Popov, the world record-holder
at 48.21 seconds. Scherer was timed in 48.91, and Pieter van den
Hoogenband of the Netherlands was second in 49.61.
	   ``I knew I had swum a great race when I finished, but I wasn't
sure how good my time would be,'' said Scherer, who was fifth in
the Olympic 100 free two years ago. ``I felt great until the last 5
meters, when my legs felt dead.''
	   The final indignity came in the 400 freestyle relay, as the
World team, anchored by Scherer, won in 3:22.42 _ 2.73 seconds
ahead of the Americans.
	   ``This is the fastest pool I've ever been in,'' Scherer said.
	   Few Americans would agree, but there were a few U.S. highlights.
	   World champion Lenny Krayzelburg of Los Angeles won the 200
backstroke in 1:58.17, a Goodwill record and the ninth-fastest time
in history. Davis captured the 200 freestyle and Kurt Grote of San
Diego, California won the 100 breaststroke.
	   ``The World team is a lot stronger than the rest of the
competition,'' Davis said. ``They have an advantage because they
have some of the best in the world mixed on one team.''
	   Todd Eldredge, the former world champion from the United States,
won the gold men in men's figure skating with a string of 5.8s and
5.9s. Russians Alexei Urmanov and Evgeni Plushenko were 2-3.
	   World champions Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze of
Russia won the gold medal in pairs figure skating, beating
archrivals Artur Dmitriev and Oksana Kazakova. The bronze went to
Dorota Zagorska and Mariusz Siudek of Poland.
	   Cuban boxers won two of the first three gold medals. Mario
Kindelan defeated Jacob Hudson of Augusta, Georgia, for the
lightweight title, 13-4. Light flyweight Maikro Romero beat Aleksan
Nalbaniyan of Russia 10-5, before Timur Tulyakov of Uzbekistan beat
world championship silver medalist Waldemar Font 15-14.
	   Four referees and judges accused of bias against Russian boxers
were suspended by AIBA, the international amateur boxing
federation.
	   Kicked out of the games were referee-judges Macario Sosa of
Guatemala and Alfredo Toledo of Cuba; referee Per-Olaf Larsson of
Sweden; and judge Dieter Mika of Germany.
	   There will be a new champion in women's beach volleyball.
Defending gold medalists Karolyn Kirby and Liz Masakayan of San
Diego lost to Brazil's top-seeded Shelda Bede and Adriana Behar
15-9.
	   Bede and Behar scored nine straight points for a 10-1 lead, then
four of the last five points to wrap it up. In between, the U.S.
pair scored seven of eight points with play that brought back
visions of their days at the top: an ace, three kills and a block
by Kirby, and pressure behind Masakayan's serve.
	   ``Once we started getting points, it was really the old Liz and
Karolyn started coming back, where we started gaining some
confidence and we had something we could work with,'' the
37-year-old Kirby said. ``It's just too bad we didn't think of that
a little bit earlier.''
	   Masakayan and Kirby's last chance of advancing to Saturday's
semifinals ended when Pauline Manser and Kerri Pottharst of
Australia beat winless Kristine Drakich and Guylaine Dumont of
Canada 15-8.
	   Also reaching the final four were Americans Holly McPeak and
Lisa Arce, who beat Maike Friedrichsen and Danja Musch of Germany
15-11, and Italy's Laura Bruschini and Annamaria Solazzi.

Tropical Storm Alex weakens, but may veer closer to Caribbean

islands &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Tropical Storm Alex has weakened, posing only a
minimal threat to Puerto Rico and other Caribbean islands, although
it could come closer to land than earlier thought.
	   ``The good news is that the storm is falling apart,'' Jerry
Jarrell, director of the U.S. National Hurricane Center, said
Friday.
	   But, he said, the storm is centered farther south than had been
expected, a course that may bring it closer to the islands.
	   At 11 p.m. EDT Friday (0300 GMT Saturday), Alex was located near
16.1 north latitude, 52.1 west longitude, or about 575 miles (925
kilometers) east of the Leeward Islands in the eastern Caribbean.
	   The storm's wind speed decreased to near 40 mph (64 kph). It is
moving west at about 13 mph (21 kph). Forecasters say that although
they said Thursday that they expected Alex to reach hurricane
status within two days, strong southerly upper-level winds hit the
storm, weakening it.
	   Forecasters said Alex could be downgraded to a tropical
depression Friday night or Saturday.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The government confirmed the deaths of all
four men aboard a small aircraft belonging to President Ernesto
Zedillo's military staff that crashed last month in central Mexico.
	   Earlier reports had indicated that the SkyVan eight-seater had
been carrying eight people when it crashed on July 23 in a remote
mountain area about 125 miles (200 kilometers) east of Mexico City.
	   All four of the victims were members of the armed forces, flying
a routine mission for the presidential guard service between
southern Chiapas state and Mexico City, the President's Office said
in a press statement Friday.
	   The bodies were recovered Thursday, and experts are analyzing
the wreckage to determine the cause of the crash.

7,000-8,000 prisoners to be given amnesty this year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Between 7,000 and 8,000 prisoners will be
given amnesty in Vietnam's biggest-ever release on National Day,
Sept. 2, the Labor newspaper reported Saturday.
	   An Amnesty Consultancy Council has been set up to consider who
will be freed.
	   Gen. Hoang Ngoc Nhat, a deputy police minister, was quoted as
saying priority will be given to those who have made major
contributions to the country; prisoners with special circumstances,
such as being the family bread-winner; and women with children
under age 3.
	   They still must have have served at least a quarter of their
sentences. Others to be released must have served at least a third
of their terms.
	   Two other major amnesties are planned for 1999 and 2000, Nhat
said, adding that social stability and development made the
releases possible.
	   Although human-rights group claim Vietnam holds many people for
their political or religious beliefs and teaching, the government
has repeatedly denied holding political prisoners or prisoners of
conscience.

Vietnam hails vote to back Clinton's promotion of trade
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The U.S. Congress' backing for President
Bill Clinton's decision to promote trade with Vietnam is the first
significant step in normalizing trade relations, the Communist
Party newspaper The People said Saturday.
	   The Foreign Ministry on Friday had welcomed the vote as a
positive development in promoting bilateral trade and economic
normalization.
	   The House of Representatives, by a 260-163 vote on Thursday,
rejected a motion to overturn a presidential waiver issued last
March that opens the way for Vietnam to get U.S. government credits
and investment guarantees.

Eldredge, Russian couple win Goodwill skating
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with men's final. &QL; 
 &UR; By HAL BOCK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ On a night when a 17-year-old brought
the crowd to its feet with a rarely seen quadruple salchow, Todd
Eldredge added a Goodwill Games gold to his collection of figure
skating medals.
	   Eldredge completed his personal progression, clinching the men's
singles with a brilliant free skate Friday night. He already had
Goodwill bronze from 1990 and silver from 1994.
	   The pairs gold medal went to world champions Elena Berezhnaya
and Anton Sikharulidze, who beat archrivals Artur Dmitriev and
Oksana Kazakova. Dorota Zagorska and Mariusz Siudek of Poland
overtook Xue Shen and Hongo Zhao of China for the bronze.
	   Timothy Goebel, the only American ever to land a quad in
competition, did it again with a salchow that left his coach, Carol
Heiss Jenkins, jumping behind the corner boards and the Nassau
Coliseum crowd of 5,790 roaring. Goebel, sixth after the short
program, finished fifth.
	   ``I was absolutely thrilled,'' he said. ``It was probably the
best program I've ever done in my entire life. At the end of my
program, I knew that I did exactly what I was supposed to do. The
crowd knew it was a quad. I was impressed that they knew. And I was
really glad they were so behind me.''
	   Eldredge, the five-time national champion and former world
champion, who was fourth at the Olympics and second at the worlds,
captivated the crowd as he captured the gold.
	   Throwing triple jumps from one end of the ice to the other
during his 4 1/2-minute program, he nailed every move effortlessly.
When he finished with a combination spin that left him twirling
like a top at center ice, the crowd roared and he punched the air
in exhilaration.
	   ``I did eight triples,'' Eldredge said. ``But I was not as tired
as I thought I would be. I guess maybe that was because I was
skating very well.''
	   Coach Richard Callaghan greeted him as Eldredge came off the
ice, calling the performance ``just awesome.'' As the crowd cheered
``Six! Six! Six!'' hoping for perfect marks, the judges came close,
awarding the U.S. champion four 5.9s for technical merit and five
5.9s for performance.
	   The silver medal went to Alexei Urmanov and the bronze to Evgeni
Plushenko, both of Russia.
	   Urmanov, recovering from a groin injury that sidelined him for
16 months and prevented him from defending his Olympic title,
received three 5.9s for presentation.
	   Wearing maroon skating outfits that included an evening coat and
striped cravat for Sikharulidze, the Russian couple protected the
lead they had earned in the pairs short program with a flowing 4
1/2 minutes on the Nassau Coliseum ice.
	   The Olympic silver medalists earned three 5.8s and a 5.9 from
the Chinese judge for presentation.
	   It marked the second straight gold in major international
competition for Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze, whose first place at
the worlds was somewhat tainted by the withdrawal of Dmitriev and
Kazakova due to food poisoning.
	   Just weeks earlier, Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze had finished
second to Dmitriev and Kazakova in a battle of Russians for the
Olympic gold.
	   ``We feel good because we know we can concentrate,''
Sikharulidze said. ``If we can make everything how we want _ new
elements _ I think we can move ahead in our skating.''
	   Dmitriev and Kazakova, second before the free skate, experienced
some rough moments.
	   They were slightly out of synch on a side-by-side double axel
into a double toe loop near the start of their program and Kazakova
slipped, losing her balance for an instant.
	   They received no mark higher than 5.8 and got a 5.2 for
technical merit from the United States judge.
	   Two falls by Xue doomed the Chinese chance for a medal.

Sugar mills face severe shortage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam's sugar mills are facing a severe
shortage of cane, with nearly half running under 50 percent of
their capacity, the Thanh Nien newspaper reported Saturday.
	   It quoted a Ministry of Agriculture report as saying 35
government mills have produced 322,000 tons of refined sugar from
3.7 million tons of cane, an increase of 50 percent from last
year's crop. The output is 552,000 tons if private mills are
included.
	   But it also said 17 sugar mills are running under 50 percent of
their capacity _ some as low as 6.5 percent to 10 percent _ because
of shortage of materials.
	   The sugar industry has boomed in recent years, with some mills
built in locations with no guarantee of a stable supply of cane.
	   Agriculture Ministry officials are holding a two-day meeting in
the central resort city of Nha Trang to review the first three
years of their sugar program, under which the country is expected
to produce 1 million tons by the year 2000.
	   Vice Agriculture Minister Nguyen Thien Luan told the conference
that some sugar mills will go bankrupt over the next two years
because of a severe cane shortage.

Milwaukee acquires Pulsipher
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILWAUKEE (AP) _ The Milwaukee Brewers acquired left-handed
pitcher Bill Pulsipher from the New York Mets on Friday for minor
league infielder Mike Kinkade.
	   Pulsipher, 24, was 0-0 with a 6.91 ERA for the Mets this season
in 15 games.
	   His lone start was against the Brewers on July 22 at Milwaukee
County Stadium. He pitched four innings, his longest outing this
season.
	   Kinkade, 25, was hitting .310 for Triple-A Louisville with seven
homers and 46 RBIs. He was the Texas League player of the year last
season, hitting .385 with 12 homers and 109 RBIs for El Paso.
	   ``We just felt like we needed to get some arms and some guys who
can pitch a little bit. We're running out of bodies that can give
us the innings we need,'' Brewers general manager Sal Bando said.
	   Pulsipher had surgery in 1996 to repair a torn ligament in his
left elbow. He will join the Brewers bullpen and eventually will
start, Bando said.
	   ``Potentially he's got a chance to be a pretty good pitcher. We
felt like we had some time to get him turned around,'' Bando said.
``We felt he threw the ball pretty well against us.''
	   Bando said the team ``hated to give up Mike Kinkade. We liked
Mike but we felt right now our greatest need is to get some arms.''

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Defending champions Karolyn Kirby and Liz
Masakayan were eliminated, losing to top-ranked Brazilians Shelda
Bede and Adriana Behar 15-9. Bede and Behar ran off nine straight
points largely for a 10-1 lead, then scored four of the last five
points to wrap it up. Masakayan and Kirby's last chance to advance
ended when Pauline Manser and Kerri Pottharst of Australia beat
winless Kristine Drakich and Guylaine Dumont of Canada 15-8. Also
reaching the final four were Americans Holly McPeak and Lisa Arce,
who beat Maike Friedrichsen and Danja Musch of Germany 15-11, and
Italy's Laura Bruschini and Annamaria Solazzi.

	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ A team of World All-Stars used six
1-2 sweeps in individual events to hand the U.S. men a 78-43 loss.
The Americans, who narrowly lost to Germany when they were defeated
in the 400-meter freestyle relay _ an event they've won at every
Olympics _ started OK against the World team by winning the 400
medley relay for a 7-0 lead. But the World team then went 1-2 in
five of the next seven events for a 46-24 lead that the Americans
never challenged. Among the sweeps was in the 50 freestyle, where
world champion Bill Pilczuk of Auburn, Alabama, finished third
behind Lorenzo Vismara of Italy and Ricardo Busquets of Puerto
Rico. U.S. men traditionally have had a wealth of speedy
freestylers, but the embarrassment in the sprints continued with
another sweep by the World All-Stars in the 100.

Williams, Graf, Davenport advance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STANFORD, California (AP) _ Venus Williams hit a slight bump in
the road, but it never slowed her down as she went on to defeat
Elena Likhovtseva, 6-2, 6-4 in the quarterfinals of the Bank of the
West women's tournament.
	   Steffi Graf, the No. 4 seed, had an easier time of it in a 6-1,
6-3 victory over No. 5 seed Natasha Zvereva in another quarterfinal
match.
	   Top-seeded Lindsay Davenport also advanced to the semifinals
with a 7-6 (7-3), 6-1 victory over Tamarine Tanasugarn.
	   ``When I need a point, I know how to win one,'' said Williams,
who meets No. 2 seed Monica Seles in the semifinals Saturday
evening. ``I've learned a lot.''
	   Williams, the No. 3 seed, held a 5-2 lead in the second set, but
Likhovtseva, seeded seventh, broke her serve, then held serve to
make it 5-4, but Williams held on for the victory.
	   ``She wanted to stay in the match, so she started getting more
balls in play,'' Williams said of Likhovteva, ranked 26th in the
world.
	   Williams, who has reached the semifinals in five of the 10
tournaments she's played, is celebrating her first week as a top
five player.
	   Graf, who reaches her third semifinal of the year, was never in
trouble, building a 5-0 lead in the first set, then breaking
Zvereva's last two serves in the second set.
	   ``She gave me a lot of chances to take immediate action,'' said
Graf. ``I kept the pressure on from the beginning.''
	   Graf lost to Zvereva, at Wimbledon, the last time the two met,
6-4, 7-5, though Graf holds a 19-1 career mark against her.
	   Graf said she was looking forward to her rematch with Zvereva.
	   ``It hurt to lose to her in Wimbledon and I wanted to play
well,'' said Graf.
	   Davenport had a difficult time in the first set against
Tanasugarn.
	   ``I felt sluggish at the start, and it was a huge weight lifted
off me to win the tiebreaker,'' said Davenport, ranked third in the
world. ``I felt more relaxed in the second set.''
	   Davenport, who reached the semifinals for the seventh time in 12
tournaments, will play Graf Saturday afternoon.
	   Tanasugarn also noticed the difference in Davenport's play
between the two sets.
	   ``In the first set she gave me a chance to play well because she
was kind of missing a lot,'' said Tanasugarn. ``In the second set,
she didn't miss anything and didn't give me a chance at all.''

170,000 people short of clean water in one province
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ About 170,000 people are short of clean
water in one central Vietnamese province, where all but six of the
136 reservoirs have dried up, the Labor newspaper reported
Saturday.
	   It said workers at Quang Tri's water supply company are digging
around the clock for water from a dried-up river that normally
supplies 60,000 residents in the town of Dong Ha, where more than
100 water-related disputes have flared up in the last month.
	   Three fire trucks are providing water to the most needy there _
hospitals, a center for the seriously injured war veterans and
kindergartens, the newspaper said.
	   The ongoing drought, which started in May, has shown no sign of
easing. The average daily temperature of 39 C. (102 F.) has made
the situation steadily worsen.
	   But while the center of the country is increasingly parched, the
north is being swamped by flash floods that have killed several
people in five provinces.
	   The entire country was hit by its worst drought in a century
earlier this year.

	   SEATTLE (AP) _ The Houston Astros won out in the year-long
pursuit of Randy Johnson, acquiring the Big Unit from Seattle on
Friday night for two minor leaguers and a player to be named.
	   The New York Yankees and Cleveland also sought Johnson up until
baseball's trading deadline of 0400 GMT.
	   But the NL Central-leading Astros won out in the end, acquiring
the 1995 American League Cy Young winner for infielder Carlos
Guillen and pitching prospect Freddy Garcia and a future player.
	   ``We identified all along our primary need was a No. 1 starter,
and we got one of the dominating starters in the game,'' Astros
general manager Gerry Hunsicker said. ``It's been a long night, and
I didn't think we had much of a chance, but we were able to pull it
off.''
	   Johnson, 34, asked for a trade during the offseason after
Seattle refused to extend his contract. The 6-foot-10 (2.08 meter)
left-hander is eligible to become a free agent after the season.
	   He is 9-10 with a 4.33 ERA in 23 starts this season and leads
the AL with 213 strikeouts. He lost to Cleveland on Tuesday night,
his second straight defeat after consecutive shutouts.
	   Johnson joins a rotation that has included Mike Hampton, Shane
Reynolds, Jose Lima, Sean Bergman and Pete Schourek.
	   ``We heard before the game we were in the running for Randy
Johnson or Roger Clemens, but you can't get too excited about it
because of the teams that were in it,'' Astros first baseman Jeff
Bagwell said. ``You know we're the low market, and our chances of
getting either one were probably slim.''
	   The Yankees dropped out when Seattle insisted on obtaining
Hideki Irabu, who ran his record to 10-4 with the Yankees' 5-3
victory over Seattle.
	   ``We discussed a lot of things with a lot of different clubs,
but the price to try to improve at this time was just too high,''
general manager Brian Cashman said. ``We like this team and have a
great deal of confidence in it.''

Kidnapper shot dead by police after abducting Japanese
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ILIGAN CITY, Philippines (AP) _ Police killed a security guard
who tried to kidnap a Japanese consultant of a Filipino cement firm
in this southern Philippine city early Saturday.
	   Police said the guard was with the driver of a van sent to pick
up Hittaro Hirotake, 60, a consultant of Alsons Cement Corp. at his
apartment.
	   The guard, Federico Tabada, a 45-year-old former army sergeant,
immediately ordered the driver at gunpoint to drive away as soon as
Hirotake boarded the van, police Senior Inspector Macausor
Mangabang said.
	   The driver was able to escape with the car key when the vehicle
slowed down to avoid pedestrians and reported the abduction to the
police.
	   Tabada then commandeered a passenger mini-bus but was stopped at
a police roadblock about two kilometers (about one mile) away from
Hirotake's apartment.
	   During a brief standoff, Hirotake wrestled free from Tabada, who
then engaged police in a gunfight in which he was killed.
	   Hirotake was ``very hysterical'' after the incident and gave
little information to the police before company officials took him
away, Mangabang said.
	   Police investigators believe a kidnap gang operating in Iligan,
about 780 kilometers (485 miles) southeast of Manila, was involved
and Tabada was used only for the first stage of the kidnapping.

New government takes over in Japan, but song remains the same

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan is a nation thirsting for change. The economy
is sinking deeper into recession, its leaders are widely accused of
inaction and mismanagement, and the mood is growing gloomier by the
day.
	   But Japan's new government will be anything but revolutionary.
	   In electing ruling party favorite Keizo Obuchi as prime minister
Thursday, lawmakers picked an inconspicuous consensus-builder to
try to rouse Japan from its malaise and win the confidence of its
allies.
	   The choice only intensified spreading discontent among reformist
lawmakers and urban voters who want to thrust the governing Liberal
Democratic Party from power.
	   While opposition leaders kept up demands for immediate general
elections to pick a new Parliament, voters were even less
diplomatic.
	   ``The person I least wanted to become prime minister won,'' said
Yoshiki Yamaoka, 51, a trading company worker in Tokyo. ``He won't
be able to make decisions by himself. He'll just follow the
instructions of party elders.''
	   To be sure, Japan's economic problems seem so deep that no
leader could reasonably be expected to roll into office and turn
the financial mess around with a few quick reforms.
	   The government announced Friday that unemployment hit a
record-high 4.3 percent in June. The American credit monitoring
firm Moody's Investors Service is reconsidering its top rating on
Japanese government debt. Bankruptcies are piling up at a record
rate.
	   Banks, meanwhile, are struggling to write off a growing burden
of bad loans left over from the real estate market crash of the
early 1990s. The government estimates banks' problem loans total 76
trillion yen (dlrs 535 billion), but some experts put the figure at
nearly twice that.
	   Obuchi's answer dovetails with what many economists recommend:
tax cuts and public works spending to stimulate the economy. He has
proposed 6 trillion yen (dlrs 42 billion) in tax cuts and 10
trillion yen (dlrs 70 billion) in extra public works spending.
	   He also is pushing ahead with legislation started by his
predecessor, Ryutaro Hashimoto, to liquidate failing financial
institutions.
	   ``I hope the economy will recover in around two years,'' he told
reporters Friday at his first news conference as prime minister.
	   Conscious of his image as a status-quo, make-no-waves operator,
Obuchi tried to jazz up the new Cabinet by appointing former Prime
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa as finance chief, capitalizing on that
party elder's credentials as an economics expert. He served as
finance minister in the 1980s and prime minister in 1991-93.
	   The move sparked a rally in the lackluster Tokyo stock market,
but it also was tarred by some as a sign of inertia, with critics
pointing out that Miyazawa had a hand in the policies that led to
Japan's economic mess.
	   ``I rather doubt Miyazawa is going to do anything particularly
drastic,'' said Jason James, a strategist at James Capel Pacific
Ltd., a brokerage in Tokyo. ``He wasn't a spectacularly effective
prime minister or finance minister last time around.''
	   Given the political divisions in Japan, it's not at all certain
Obuchi will be able to push his economic program through
Parliament.
	   The Liberal Democratic Party suffered a painful defeat in July
12 elections for seats in Parliament's upper house, a setback that
forced Hashimoto to resign. And the party's slim majority in the
lawmaking lower house is built on a handful of lawmakers who
defected to the LDP after being elected under different banners.
	   So Obuchi is going to have to deal with the opposition to get
things done _ an opposition that has already predicted his
government is likely to fail.
	   The new government is also fighting something more intangible: a
dark national mood.
	   True, the Japanese are hardly braving poverty. Young people
still throng trendy discos and revel in the latest gadgetry.
Japanese soccer fans showed they had the cash needed to fly to
France and buy scalped tickets for the World Cup soccer
championship.
	   But in the fuzzy world of perceptions, the Japanese feel they're
on a downward slide. It's not just the economy _ crime rates are
creeping up, people are worried about the declining birth rate and
the aging of the population, the education system is widely
criticized as too rigid.
	   That translates into political trouble for whoever is in charge.
	   ``I'm not really hoping for anything from the new
administration,'' said Masakazu Sasaki, 28, an electrical company
worker in Tokyo. ``Up till now, we haven't been able to trust in
the LDP ... so another party should have a chance.''

Cambodian poll-watchers say voting was mostly smooth as results
</HEADLINE>
pending &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBIN McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's biggest independent
poll-watching group said Saturday that voting procedures at more
than 90 percent of the country's polling stations ``went smoothly
and without incident'' during the country's recent parliamentary
election.
	   The Committee for Free and Fair Elections in Cambodia _ COMFREL
_ said some serious violations had been reported by its observers
during last Sunday's polls, but they believed that the cases
represented scattered incidents.
	   At the same time, however, the group expressed serious concern
about post-election violence and intimidation directed against
members of opposition parties.
	   The group issued its evaluation as final official election
results were still being awaited.
	   A projection by COMFREL of the final tally gives the ruling
Cambodian People's Party 64 seats in the 122-seat National
Assembly, the leading opposition group FUNCINPEC 43 seats, and its
ally the Sam Rainsy Party 15 seats.
	   The ruling party's projected parliamentary margin increased
Friday after it became known that a new, little-known formula
favoring the party getting the most votes would be used to
determine the allocation of the winners' parliamentary seats.
	   Opposition parties on Friday repeated their allegations of
cheating by the ruling party in the polls.
	   The FUNCINPEC party of Prince Norodom Ranariddh and the Sam
Rainsy Party issued a joint statement saying they would accept the
election's results ``when and if the serious irregularities
reported'' were shown not to have altered its outcome
	   COMFREL director Thun Saray, said Saturday reports had been
received from the provinces of Takeo, Kampong Cham and Prey Veng of
29 political party activists who had been threatened since the
election.
	   ``These incidents were mostly direct verbal threats but included
other forms of intimidating behavior,'' he said.
	   Scores of opposition party activists from rural areas have taken
shelter in the FUNCINPEC and Sam Rainsy Party headquarters in Phnom
Penh after being threatened by police and local authorities loyal
to the Cambodian People's Party.
	   Thun Saray speculated that some of the problems were based on
disputes from before and during the campaign, and that some ruling
party supporters were very proud of their victory and wanted to
show off their new strength and influence.
	   He called on the government's National Election Committee to see
that such charges of intimidation were pursued by the authorities,
as well as to investigate complaints of serious violations in the
voting and vote-counting processes.
	   The two main opposition parties on Friday called on Hun Sen's
ruling party to immediately end ``the campaign of intimidation it
has mounted against our activists in villages and communes across
Cambodia.''
	   ``The testimony of these activists, many of whom are
eyewitnesses to electoral fraud, is essential to an assessment of
the election results,'' said the statement from the FUNCINPEC and
Sam Rainsy parties.
	   Opposition parties on Tuesday had already asked that new votes
be taken in disputed precincts if their charges of wrongdoing were
found to be valid.
	   They threatened to boycott the National Assembly if their
complaints were not heeded.
	   Without the opposition's attendance, the assembly is unlikely to
have present the two-thirds of its 122 members needed to conduct
any business.
	   Hun Sen responded by inviting them to join a coalition
government, but warned that if they carried out their threat not to
attend the National Assembly, he could lower the constitutional
minimum for the assembly to meet and confirm a government from
two-thirds to 50 percent plus one. He also said his current
government could remain in power.
	   Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh as his co-premier in a violent coup a
year ago, dismantling much of his political machine in the process.
	   Their co-premiership emerged from U.N.-sponsored elections in
1993 which were meant to usher in a new era of peace and democracy.
	   Ranariddh won, but Hun Sen, who came to power in 1985 under the
harsh Vietnamese occupation that followed the Khmer Rouge, forced
his way into a coalition by threatening war.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen,
who has urged the Indonesian military to show restraint as their
nation moves toward democracy, met Indonesia's president and top
military brass Saturday at the beginning of a two-day visit.
	   Cohen arrived in Jakarta late Friday from Sydney, where he and
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright took part in annual
talks on the state of U.S.-Australian relations.
	   He met Indonesia's armed forces chief, Gen. Wiranto, at the
defense ministry and the two then joined President B.J. Habibie at
the presidential palace for two hours of talks.
	   Cohen, who had no immediate comment, planned to hold a news
conference later Friday. On Sunday, he was scheduled to fly to the
Philippines, the next leg on his regional tour.
	   Cohen suspended joint U.S. military training in Indonesia in May
amid rioting and protests that ended the 32-year authoritarian rule
of former President Suharto. The United States wants to resume some
military programs with the Indonesian armed forces, which have been
tainted by allegations of human rights abuses.
	   In Sydney, Cohen said that the United States had maintained
military contacts to urge restraint as Indonesia endures its worst
economic crisis in decades. U.S. officials have praised the
military for backing the transition from Suharto to his civilian
successor, Habibie.
	   Human rights groups have accused Indonesian military units, some
with U.S. training, of widespread abuses.
	   Prior to Suharto's downfall, security forces killed four
students at a demonstration in Jakarta, unleashing the citywide
rioting in which 1,200 people were killed.
	   Critics have also accused the armed forces of responding slowly
to much of the rioting and of failing to thoroughly investigate
reports that rioters raped ethnic Chinese women.
	   Additionally, the military has been tainted by its alleged
involvement in the kidnapping of pro-democracy activists earlier
this year. Eleven members of an elite army unit have been arrested.

Castro swipes at Latin America, recalls past slights

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Fidel Castro and his one-time foes in
the Caribbean are burying the hatchet this week. But it's a
different story with Latin America, a region for which the Cuban
president seems to harbor a deep grudge.
	   At almost every stop during his triumphant three-day tour of
Jamaica, Castro volunteered an unflattering comment about the
nations of Latin America _ usually related to their shunning
communism and post-revolutionary Cuba.
	   ``I shall remind you, I cannot ignore it, of when the whole of
Latin America except for Mexico severed relations with Cuba,''
Castro fumed at one point. ``When they became accomplices of the
aggressions against our country and accomplices of the (U.S.)
economic blockade.''
	   He also belittled Latin American health and educational systems
and even blamed them for the excessive power of the United States.
	   ``If the rest of Latin America had done what Cuba did,'' he
said, referring to the Communist takeover he led four decades ago,
``we would not be living today in a world of one homogeneous
power,'' Castro told a town hall meeting in Kingston.
	   On the eve of Emancipation Day for former British colonies in
the region, Castro, in mid-praise of the Caribbean states, suddenly
turned his sights on Central and South America.
	   ``Independence and freedom in this hemisphere began with the
struggle put up by the slaves, whereas in Latin America there was
not an awareness or sense of independence,'' he claimed, without
elaborating.
	   Castro, who appears to be angling for admission into the
Caribbean Community, seemed to be suggested he was not ready to
return to the Organization of American States from which Cuba was
expelled in 1962 _ although some regional leaders are pushing for
it.
	   Several times, he compared Latin America unfavorably with the
Caribbean.
	   ``Latin America has been independent for 200 years. However, the
Caribbean countries, which have been independent for 35 or 40 years
have better rates of education, better health rates.''
	   Cuba, he claimed, eradicated illiteracy in one year.
	   Castro even invoked Latin America in his arguments against the
38-year U.S. economic blockade against Cuba. ``It was in the
Caribbean that the initiative emerged to fight that blockade,'' he
recalled.
	   Castro also stressed that Latin American countries were
conspicuous in not opposing a much-feared U.S. challenge to the
Caribbean islands' preferential banana trade with the European
Union. Caribbean leaders themselves have blamed only the United
States for the move, which stands to benefit some U.S.-owned
plantations in Central and South America.
	   Despite the hard feelings, Castro pledged to ``defend the cause
of the Latin American peoples and countries as exploited countries,
as countries that were kept in poverty and underdevelopment for so
long, as countries that were plundered.''

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Andre Agassi kept up his recent habit of
speedy victories, defeating Australian Sandon Stolle 7-6 (7-2), 6-2
Friday in just over an hour to advance to the Mercedes Cup
semifinals.
	   Agassi won his ninth straight match without dropping a set since
Wimbledon. His streak includes a title last week at Washington,
where his matches averaged 59 minutes. He beat Stolle in 1 hour, 20
minutes.
	   ``I tend to walk quick, but when it comes time to serve I slow
it down,'' he said. ``I don't think I rush out there.''
	   Agassi advanced to Saturday's semifinals against Justin
Gimelstob, who upset top-seeded Patrick Rafter 6-4, 6-3 in the
night match.
	   ``I know he wants a piece of me,'' said Gimelstob, who earned
the biggest victory of his career here last year when he beat
Agassi in the first round.
	   In other quarterfinals, No. 2 seed Tim Henman beat No. 7 Bryon
Black 5-7, 6-1, 6-4 and Guillaume Raoux of France outlasted local
favorite Michael Joyce 6-7 (7-9), 6-4, 7-5.
	   Agassi didn't take the court until nearly 0100 GMT after the two
previous matches went three sets. By then, the sun was going down
and towering trees on the UCLA college campus cast long shadows
across the court.
	   ``You can't see the ball at all that time of day,'' he said.
``My game is based around hitting the ball cleanly and I didn't
have any confidence at all the first set that I could swing and hit
it cleanly in the shadows.''
	   Agassi's coach, Brad Gilbert, came on the court during the first
changeover in the second set, part of the ATP Tour's experiment
with coaching during matches. Los Angeles is the final stop in a
five-tournament experiment.
	   ``He was trying to get me to swing out on my shots because I
couldn't see with the shadows,'' said Agassi, who played his first
two matches here at night.
	   Agassi broke Stolle to take a 2-0 lead after Gilbert's
two-minute pep talk. He fought off triple break point in the fifth
game and took a 4-1 lead when Stolle netted a forehand volley.
	   Stolle, whose father, Fred, won the doubles title here in 1968
with Ken Rosewall, held serve to trail 4-2. But Agassi held serve
with an ace and then broke Stolle on his second match point to win.
	   Against Rafter, Gimelstob closed out the first set with a
forehand crosscourt return. He aced Rafter to take a 4-1 lead in
the second set. The Australian held serve and then broke back to
trail 4-3. But Gimelstob, a former collegiate doubles champion at
UCLA before turning pro in 1996, regained the break on Rafter's
double fault for a 5-3 lead.
	   Gimelstob blew triple match point and survived two deuces before
Rafter netted a forehand service return to end the match.
	   ``It's just another loss. Life goes on,'' said Rafter, who'll
defend his U.S. Open title later this month. ``I'm still hitting
the ball well, so I'm not too discouraged by the loss.''
	   Gimelstob was cheered by several friends on the court where he
played and practiced hundreds of times in college.
	   ``I'm not shocked, I'm excited,'' he said. ``I've been working
hard and preparing myself to win that kind of match. It's proof I'm
ready to take the next step.''

	   TAKHMAU, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian leader Hun Sen said Saturday
that a former Khmer Rouge general wanted for the abduction and
murder of three Western tourists in 1994 has been arrested and will
stand trial in Phnom Penh.
	   ``This is a success for our national police,'' Hun Sen told
reporters at his residence after briefing the ambassadors from
France, Britain and Australia about the arrest. ``We asked those
countries to send lawyers on behalf of those victims for the
trial.''
	   Nuon Paet led a band of Khmer Rouge guerrillas who halted a
train in 1994 and abducted three young Western tourists: David
Wilson of Australia, Mark Slater of Britain and Jean-Michel Braquet
of France.
	   The guerrillas, holed up on rugged Vine Mountain in the southern
province of Kampot, held three months of protracted negotiations
with the government before killing their captives.
	   The case had caused considerable controversy, especially in
Australia, because it was believed that the Cambodian government
had mishandled the negotiations.
	   There were also criticism that the government for at least the
past year had been aware of Nuon Paet's whereabouts but was
unwilling to apprehend him.
	   ``The sooner the trial takes place the better,'' said Hun Sen,
who appeared relaxed and happy, adding that the ambassadors
expressed ``satisfaction'' at news of the arrest.
	   Hun Sen said that the trial should take place in Phnom Penh for
security reasons.
	   Nuon Paet was detained by criminal police when his car was
stopped on the road from Phnom Penh International Airport to the
capital early Saturday. He was then taken to the Justice Police
prison in the capital's center pending court procedures.
	   ``According to the latest information, Nuon Paet disguised
himself in an army uniform or as a trader,'' said Hun Sen, speaking
about the notorious guerrilla's recent activities. He said that he
had been ``active in the area between the Thai border and Pailin,''
smuggling cars from Thailand. Pailin is a former Khmer Rouge
stronghold on Cambodia's western border.
	   Sim Theng, a former Khmer Rouge division commander, told The
Associated Press last year that Nuon Paet had disguised himself and
attempted to defect among the estimated 10,000 guerrillas who have
laid down their arms since August, 1996.
	   The defections, initiated by high-ranking Khmer Rouge figure
Ieng Sary, crippled the revolutionary movement and given the
country its best chance for peace in decades.
	   The Khmer Rouge seized power in 1975 and killed as many as 2
million Cambodians in a bid to create a communist agrarian utopia.
It battled successive central governments after it was overthrown
in 1979 by a Vietnamese invasion.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ It was business as usual Saturday for
passengers traveling between Singapore and Malaysia, even though no
last minute agreement had been reached between the squabbling
neighbors over the location of Malaysia's customs and immigration
post.
	   Beginning August 1, Singapore moved its railway customs post
from Tanjong Pagar in downtown Singapore to Woodlands, the
checkpoint across the water from the Malaysian city of Johor Bahru.
	   Malaysia has refused to relocate its customs post from Tanjong
Pagar. Singapore proclaimed that checkpoint illegal, saying it
would allow people to obtain permission to enter Malaysia before
gaining clearance to exit Singapore.
	   Earlier this week Singapore said that all immigration stamps
made by Malaysian officers at Tanjong Pagar station on Singapore
and other passports will be ``unauthorized and improper.'' It also
warned foreign passengers with such unauthorized travel permits on
their passports that they may face difficulties at Singapore
immigration checkpoints.
	   As the Aug 1 deadline approached, the lack of agreement left in
limbo hundreds of thousands of daily passengers, mostly Malaysians
traveling to work in Singapore.
	   In what appeared a temporary face-saving solution, Malaysian
immigration officers showed up at Tanjong Pagar station but did not
stamp the passports of the hundreds of people boarding the 8:15
a.m. (12:15 GMT) train.
	   The train then stopped at the Woodlands station to be cleared by
the Singapore custom and immigration officers.
	   International press was denied access by the Singapore police to
the platform, as well as to the subsequent news briefing in the
station. No explanation was given.
	   There appeared to be no Malaysian immigration officers at the
Woodlands railway platform.
	   The train then left Singapore and proceeded to Johor Bahru, the
first stop in Malaysia. Singapore TV reported that no immigration
facilities were set up at the station, and that passengers left
without being cleared for entry.
	   Earlier in the day, an overnight train from Kuala Lumpur, the
Malaysian capital, arrived in Singapore and was cleared for entry
at Woodlands after passing through Malaysian emmigration at Johor
Bahru.
	   The latest dispute has heightened tensions between the two
neighbors, which in 1963 were briefly united in a federation.
	   Though the experiment failed, the two countries still depend
closely on each other, with Malaysia providing most of Singapore's
water and hundreds of thousands of its workers, and Singapore
businesses investing heavily in Malaysian industry.
	   The news media in both countries have been used in propaganda
wars in a replay of past disputes over water, tourism, and other
issues.
	   In 1989, Singapore decided to abandon the joint checkpoint in
Tanjong Pagar and move it closer to the actual border, saying this
would facilitate checks on drug traffickers, smugglers and illegal
immigrants.
	   Malaysia said Saturday it was will continue to check passengers
at Tanjong Pagar.
	   ``As far as we are concerned, we will function as usual,'' Prime
Minister Mohamad Mahathir told reporters.
	   ``If there is a souring of relations between Malaysia and
Singapore, it is because of them,'' Mahathir said.

	   TAKHMAU, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian leader Hun Sen said Saturday
that a former Khmer Rouge general wanted for the abduction and
murder of three Western tourists in 1994 has been arrested and will
stand trial in Phnom Penh.
	   ``This is a success for our national police,'' Hun Sen told
reporters at his residence after briefing the ambassadors from
France, Britain and Australia about the arrest. ``We asked those
countries to send lawyers on behalf of those victims for the
trial.''
	   Nuon Paet led a band of Khmer Rouge guerrillas who halted a
train in 1994 and abducting three young Western tourists: David
Wilson of Australia, Mark Slater of Britain and Jean-Michel Braquet
of France.
	   The guerrillas, holed up on rugged Vine Mountain in the southern
province of Kampot, held three months of protracted negotiations
with the government before allegedly killing their captives.
	   The case had caused considerable controversy, especially in
Australia, because it was believed that the Cambodian government
had mishandled the negotiations.
	   There were also criticism that the government for at least the
past year had been aware of Nuon Paet's whereabouts but was
unwilling to apprehend him.
	   ``The sooner the trial takes place the better,'' said Hun Sen,
who appeared relaxed and happy, adding that the ambassadors
expressed ``satisfaction'' at news of the arrest.
	   Hun Sen said that the trial should take place in Phnom Penh for
security reasons.
	   Nuon Paet was detained by criminal police when his car was
stopped on the road from Phnom Penh International Airport to the
capital early Saturday. He was then taken to the Justice Police
prison in the capital's center pending court procedures.
	   ``According to the latest information, Nuon Paet disguised
himself in an army uniform or as a trader,'' said Hun Sen, speaking
about the notorious guerrilla's recent activities. He said that he
had been ``active in the area between the Thai border and Pailin,''
smuggling cars from Thailand. Pailin is a former Khmer Rouge
stronghold on Cambodia's western border.
	   Sim Theng, a former Khmer Rouge division commander, told The
Associated Press last year that Nuon Paet had disguised himself and
attempted to defect among the estimated 10,000 guerrillas who have
laid down their arms since August, 1996.
	   The defections, initiated by high-ranking Khmer Rouge figure
Ieng Sary, crippled the revolutionary movement and given the
country its best chance for peace in decades.
	   The Khmer Rouge seized power in 1975 and killed as many as 2
million Cambodians in a bid to create a communist agrarian utopia.
It battled successive central governments after it was overthrown
in 1979 by a Vietnamese invasion.

Seattle trades Randy Johnson to Houston, highlighting a big day of

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Houston Astros capped a wild day of trades,
pulling off the biggest deal of all by getting Randy Johnson from
the Seattle Mariners just minutes before Friday night's deadline.
	   Todd Stottlemyre, Juan Guzman, Carlos Perez and Ellis Burks
already had moved before the NL Central-leading Astros made their
surprising swap and acquired the Big Unit prior to the midnight EDT
(0400 GMT) deadline.
	   The New York Yankees and Cleveland pursued Johnson all week, but
Houston got him for two minor leaguers and a player to be named.
	   In all, 13 trades were made involving 45 players, including 23
major leaguers. Mark Grudzielanek, Willie Blair, Royce Clayton,
Todd Zeile, Ed Sprague and Tony Phillips were among those involved.
	   The New York Mets and Toronto both made three trades, while
Boston, Texas, Florida and Milwaukee each made two.
	   The Rangers got Stottlemyre, Clayton and Zeile in two separate
deals while Los Angeles got Grudzielanek and Perez from Montreal
for Wilton Guerrero in a multi-player deal.
	   Johnson, 34, asked for a trade during the offseason after
Seattle refused to extend his contract. The 6-foot-10 (2.08-meter)
left-hander is eligible to become a free agent after the season.
	   Johnson is 9-10 with a 4.33 ERA in 23 starts this season and
leads the AL with 213 strikeouts.
	   Houston got Johnson for infielder Carlos Guillen and pitcher
Freddy Garcia and a future player.
	   The Yankees dropped out when Seattle insisted on obtaining
Hideki Irabu. New York also was said to be interested in Toronto
pitcher Roger Clemens, as were Houston and Texas.
	   The Rangers, one game behind Anaheim in the AL West, got busy
early. They acquired Stottlemyre and Clayton from St. Louis for
pitcher Darren Oliver and third baseman Fernando Tatis, and got
Zeile from Florida for a pair of minor leaguers.
	   St. Louis, which last year got Mark McGwire only hours before
the trading deadline, gave up two players eligible for free agency
at the end of the season.
	   Stottlemyre, 33, was 9-9 this season with a 3.51 ERA. Clayton,
28, was hitting just .234 with four homers and 29 RBIs at
shortstop.
	   Oliver, 27, was 6-7 with a 6.53 ERA in 19 starts for Texas.
Tatis, 23, is hitting .270 with three homers and 32 RBIs.
	   Zeile was traded for the second time this season, having gone
from Los Angeles to Florida in May as part of the deal involving
Mike Piazza. Zeile, 32, is hitting .276 with 13 homers and 66 RBIs.
	   Florida got third base prospect Jose Santo and pitcher Daniel
DeYoung for Zeile.
	   The Dodgers, already in the middle of several big deals this
season, bolstered themselves for a wild-card run by getting Perez,
Grudzielanek and a prospect from Montreal for Guerrero and three
minor leaguers.
	   The Expos got pitcher Ted Lilly, outfielder Peter Bergeron and
first baseman Jonathan Tucker in addition to Guerrero. The Dodgers
also got minor league outfielder Hiram Bocachica.
	   Perez was 7-10 with a 3.75 ERA in 23 starts. Grudzielanek, 28,
who tied the major league record for doubles by a shortstop with 54
last season, was batting .276 with eight homers and 41 RBIs.
	   Guerrero, a 23-year-old second baseman, joins his brother, Expos
outfielder Vladimir Guerrero.
	   Baltimore, eight games behind Boston in the AL wild-card chase,
acquired Guzman from Toronto for pitcher Nerio Rodriguez and minor
league outfielder Shannon Carter.
	   Guzman, 31, was 6-12 with a 4.41 ERA. He pitched eight strong
innings Thursday night in a 1-0 win over Texas, then said he
expected to be traded at any moment.
	   The San Francisco Giants, bidding for the NL wild-card spot,
traded Darryl Hamilton, minor league pitcher James Stoops and a
player to be named to Colorado for Burks in a swap of 33-year-old
outfielders.
	   Burks was batting .286 with 16 homers and 54 RBIs. Hamilton was
batting .294 with one homer and 26 RBIs.
	   In a trade of slumping players, the New York Mets traded
outfielder Bernard Gilkey to Arizona for Willie Blair, who leads
the majors in losses.
	   As part of the deal, New York also sent minor league pitcher
Nelson Figueroa and cash to the Diamondbacks. The Mets also will
receive catcher Jorge Fabregas and a player to be named.
	   Gilkey, 31, was hitting .227 in 82 games. He sustained a stress
fracture in his left elbow early this year and was on the disabled
list from April 26 to May 11.
	   Blair was just 4-15 with a 5.34 ERA in 23 starts for the
expansion Diamondbacks.
	   The Mets, looking for a leadoff man, later got Phillips from
Toronto for minor league pitcher Leoncio Ramirez Estrella. The Mets
also sent pitcher Bill Pulsipher to Milwaukee for minor league
infielder Mike Kinkade.
	   Toronto also traded third baseman Sprague, one of the few
players left from their World Series championship team, to Oakland
for minor league pitcher Scott Rivette.
	   Boston acquired pitcher Greg Swindell and first
baseman-outfielder Orlando Merced from Minnesota for three minor
league pitchers _ Matt Kinney, Joe Thomas and John Barnes.
	   In a minor deal, the Red Sox traded pitcher Joe Hudson to the
Milwaukee Brewers for infielder Eddy Diaz.
	   And in the last deal announced, the Chicago Cubs obtained
reliever Felix Heredia and minor league pitcher Steve Hoff from
Florida for third baseman Kevin Orie and minor league pitchers Todd
Noel and Justin Speier.

Cambodian leader calls on security forces to refrain from
</HEADLINE>
intimidation &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TAKHMAU, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian leader Hun Sen on Saturday
called on his security forces not to terrorize members of the
opposition following last Sunday's parliamentary elections.
	   ``My appeal is that there must not be any intimidation,'' Hun
Sen told reporters at his home just south of the capital. His
comments were to be aired on state-run television Saturday
afternoon.
	   ``If carried out by anyone, that person must be arrested and
punished according to the law,'' he said. ``This kind of thing is
dangerous.''
	   The human rights situation in Cambodia has deteriorated since
Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party apparently won the polls,
triggering fears of retribution by his forces against those who
challenge him.
	   Scores of supporters of Prince Norodom Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC
party and the Sam Rainsy Party have fled Cambodia's rural areas to
Phnom Penh, seeking refuge at their parties' headquarters.
	   ``Any act to intimidate anyone is illegal, immoral and
unforgivable,'' he said. ``It doesn't matter if they voted for us,
against us, or even cursed us .. There must not be any
retribution.''
	   Hun Sen said that those who complained of intimidation should go
back to their villages, if necessary with assistance from
non-government organizations.
	   The human rights organization Amnesty International on Friday
urged Hun Sen to restrain his security forces from terrorizing
members of the opposition.
	   ''It is essential that the CPP-controlled security forces cease
their intimidating behavior immediately,'' said Demelza Stubbings
of the London-based group.
	   Other concerned groups, including the opposition parties, issued
similar appeals.

Reds add to Marlins' losing streak with 3-2 win
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late games &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Dmitri Young's seventh-inning double drove in the
go-ahead runs as Cincinnati edged Florida 3-2 Friday night, the
Marlins' 12th loss in 14 games.
	   Brett Tomko (10-7), who held Florida without a hit until the
fifth inning, allowed two runs and five hits in seven innings,
striking out four and walking three.
	   The loss was the Marlins' 71st of the year, one more than their
total last season when they won the World Series.
	   Gabe White pitched two perfect innings for his first save.
	   Matt Mantei (3-1), who relieved starter Jesus Sanchez, took the
loss. Sanchez allowed two runs and seven hits in six-plus innings.
 &UR; Padres 5, Expos 4
	   In Montreal, streaking Kevin Brown won his 10th straight
decision and Greg Vaughn hit his 38th home run for San Diego.
	   Brown (13-3) struck out 10 for the second straight game and for
the third time in four starts, allowing four runs on seven hits
without a walk in seven innings.
	   His career-high 10-game streak tied Atlanta's Greg Maddux for
the longest in the majors this season.
	   Trevor Hoffman pitched out of a one-out, bases-loaded jam in the
ninth to pick up his 35th save in 36 opportunities.
	   Vaughn homered immediately following Ken Caminiti's two-run shot
in the first off Carl Pavano (3-5) and Carlos Hernandez drove in
two for the Padres.
	   Vladimir Guerrero had a two-run double in the first and an RBI
single in the third.
 &UR; Astros 7, Pirates 4
	   In Pittsburgh, Carl Everett doubled in two runs with his third
hit of the game and the Houston Astros finally figured out
Francisco Cordova.
	   Mike Hampton (9-5) yielded three runs on six hits over 6 2-3
innings for his third consecutive victory over the Pirates.
	   Cordova (9-9) held the Astros to four hits and two runs over 24
innings in three 1997 starts _ including nine no-hit innings on
July 12.
	   But Cordova struggled in his first start against Houston this
season, walking five, hitting a batter and allowing five runs over
6 2-3 innings.
	   The Astros won their fourth in five games.
	   Kevin Young was 3-for-4 with a solo homer and two doubles for
the Pirates, who lost for the fifth time in seven games.
	   Jeff Bagwell gave Houston an insurance run with his 23rd homer
in the ninth off Mike Williams.
	   Doug Henry pitched the ninth for his second save.
 &UR; Cardinals 3, Braves 2
	   In Atlanta, Ray Lankford hit a three-run homer off Greg Maddux
in the sixth inning for St. Louis.
	   Mark McGwire, acquired by St. Louis from Oakland last July 31,
was 0-for-3 with two strikeouts.
	   Maddux (14-5) was working on a two-hit shutout in his bid to
become the NL's first 15-game winner when he gave up his first
homer in 84 innings since Milwaukee's Jeromy Burnitz connected June
1.
	   Maddux allowed eight hits in his eighth complete game this year,
struck out nine and walked one.
	   Kent Mercker (7-8) started for St. Louis after the Cardinals
traded Todd Stottlemyre to Texas. He allowed six hits in eight-plus
innings, struck out three and walked three.
	   Lance Painter got his first save since 1995 by striking out a
pair of pinch-hitters: Greg Colbrunn _ acquired from Colorado on
Thursday _ and Michael Tucker.
	   Tony Graffanino hit a two-run homer in the third for Atlanta.
 &UR; Diamondbacks 8, Brewers 2
	   In Milwaukee, Devon White and Jay Bell hit home runs to back
Andy Benes (8-11), who gave up six hits in 7 2-3 innings and struck
out five.
	   In the sixth, Andy Fox, who had three hits, singled and Bell
followed with his 14th home run. Karim Garcia doubled with two outs
and scored on Danny Klassen's triple. Brent Brede's RBI single
chased Jeff Juden (7-10).
	   White homered off Valerio De Los Santos in the eighth. Dave
Dellucci made it 8-2 with an RBI single in the ninth.
 &UR; Dodgers 4, Mets 3
	   In New York, Eric Young's RBI double scored the go-ahead run as
Los Angeles scored three times with two outs in the ninth inning.
	   Trailing 3-1, The Dodgers put together a three-run rally against
John Franco (0-6). With two outs, pinch-hitter Roger Cedeno hit an
RBI triple to right. Franco then threw a wild pitch that tied the
game at 3, his fifth blown save of the season.
	   After pinch-hitter Tom Prince singled, Young hit a line drive to
the wall in left.
	   Young went 3-for-5 as the Dodgers won for just the third time in
49 games when trailing after eight innings.
	   Antonio Osuna (6-0) got two outs for the win and Jeff Shaw
pitched the ninth for his 32nd save.
	   Brian McRae's two-out triple in the fifth off Darren Dreifort
gave the Mets a 2-1 lead.
 &UR; Giants 7, Phillies 6
	   In Philadelphia, Bill Mueller's tiebreaking double with two outs
in the ninth was San Francisco's 32nd comeback win of the season.
	   Jose Mesa (2-0) worked the eighth for the win and Robb Nen
pitched the ninth for his 28th save in 29 chances.
	   Rey Sanchez doubled with one out in the ninth against Yorkis
Perez (0-2). One out later, Mueller lined a double into the
left-field corner.
	   San Francisco tagged Philadelphia starter Curt Schilling for
four runs in the first inning, capped by Jeff Kent's 14th homer.
	   Schilling fanned five, raising his major league-leading
strikeout total to 214. He worked six innings, allowing nine hits,
five earned runs and one walk.
 &UR; Cubs 9, Rockies 1 &QC; 
	   In Chicago, Sammy Sosa hit his 42nd homer and Henry Rodriguez
homered twice to help Cubs rookie Kerry Wood win his 11th game.
	   Sosa homered in the first on a 3-2 pitch from Jamey Wright, a
drive to right center against the wind that just cleared the fence.
Sosa is second in the majors in homers behind St. Louis' Mark
McGwire, who has 45.
	   After Sosa's homer, Mark Grace walked and Rodriguez followed
with another homer to make it 3-0.
	   Wood (11-5) improved to 8-0 in 10 starts at Wrigley Field this
season. He allowed five singles, struck out six and walked four,
leaving with one out in the eighth after walking the bases loaded.

Devil Rays down Tigers, 5-1
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Florida (AP) _ Fred McGriff drove in two runs
with a pair of RBI singles and Julio Santana pitched eight strong
innings to win for the first time in six weeks Friday night as
Tampa Bay beat Detroit 5-1.
	   The victory was the seventh in eight games for the Devil Rays,
who got a solo homer from Miguel Cairo and extended Detroit's
losing streak to four straight.
	   Santana (3-2) limited the Tigers to five hits and allowed a
fifth-inning run on Paul Bako's sacrifice fly. He struck out two
and walked none for his first win since beating Boston on June 20.
	   Roberto Hernandez got the final two outs for his 19th save.
	   McGriff went 4-for-4, including RBI singles in the first and
third innings off Seth Greisinger (1-6), who also gave up an RBI
single to Wade Boggs and a run-scoring double to Quinton McCracken
as Tampa Bay built a 4-0 lead in the third.
 &UR; Twins 6, Blue Jays 4
	   In Minneapolis, Frank Rodriguez pitched five-hit ball over seven
innings and Paul Molitor's tie-breaking sacrifice fly sparked a
three-run seventh for Minnesota.
	   Rookie David Ortiz added an RBI double to make it 5-3 and Ron
Coomer had a run-scoring single off Woody Williams (9-6) during the
rally.
	   Rodriguez won his first decision of the season and tied a career
high with eight strikeouts. Rodriguez allowed three runs in the
first four innings, but retired the last nine batters he faced
before Greg Swindell relieved.
	   Rick Aguilera pitched the ninth for his 27th save in 35
attempts.
	   Jose Canseco's 30th home run in the eighth off Swindell made it
6-4.
	   Terry Steinbach homered in the second for Minnesota.
	   Nixon stole his 24th and 25th bases in the third inning, moving
him past Ozzie Smith into 19th place on the career list.
 &UR; Royals 9, Orioles 6
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, Dean Palmer hit two of Kansas City's
four home runs and had four RBIs as Baltimore lost for the fourth
time in 21 games.
	   Palmer hit a two-run homer off Scott Erickson (11-9) in the
third and another two-run shot off Doug Drabek in the sixth. Jeff
King and Johnny Damon also homered and Jose Offerman singled twice
to stretch his career-best hitting streak to 20 games.
	   Jose Rosado (6-8) held the Orioles to five hits through seven
innings, while Erickson lasted just three innings in his
league-leading 25th start.
	   Rosado, with victories in three of four starts, gave up five
hits and one run, with five strikeouts and one walk.
	   Eric Davis stretched his hitting streak to 18 games with a solo
home run in the sixth, his third homer in two games.
	   Larry Sutton and Hal Morris each had three of the Royals'
season-high 15 hits.
	   Chris Hoiles hit his ninth homer, a two-run shot in the ninth.
 &UR; White Sox 10, Rangers 2
	   In Arlington, Texas, Albert Belle broke the major league record
for home runs in July with his 16th and Frank Thomas broke out of a
slump with a grand slam and five RBIs for Chicago.
	   Belle's two-run shot to center off Tim Crabtree in the seventh
broke the record held by Joe DiMaggio (1937), Hank Greenberg
(1938), Joe Adcock (1956) and Juan Gonzalez (1996).
	   It was Belle's 33rd home run of the season. He finished July
with 32 RBIs.
	   Thomas ended a 3-for-30 slump with a line-drive, bases-loaded
homer to left-center in the fifth off John Burkett (6-11) put the
White Sox up 6-1. It was his fifth career grand slam and first
since 1996.
	   Chicago starter John Snyder (3-0) became the first White Sox
pitcher to win his first three career starts since Jack McDowell in
1987. Snyder allowed one earned run on six hits, struck one and
walked two in five innings.
	   Luis Alicea hit a solo homer in the eighth for Texas.
 &UR; Yankees 5, Mariners 3
	   In Seattle, Jorge Posada hit two home runs and Scott Brosius
added another as the Yankees moved 49 games over .500 for the first
time since 1961.
	   Hideki Irabu (10-4), who was supposed to be a key player in a
Randy Johnson-to-the-Yankees trade scenario, gave up solo home runs
to Alex Rodriguez, Edgar Martinez and David Segui, but improved his
record in July to 4-1. He gave up six hits, walked one and struck
out six in seven-plus innings.
	   Mariano Rivera pitched the ninth for his 29th save and 18th
straight.
	   Jeff Fassero (10-7) pitched a complete game for Seattle.
 &UR; Red Sox 7, Angels 2
	   In Anaheim, California, Nomar Garciaparra capped a five-run
eighth inning rally for Boston with a two-run homer.
	   Bret Saberhagen (11-5) pitched seven innings, allowing an
unearned run and five hits. Troy Glaus' second-inning RBI double _
in his first major league plate appearance _ was the only hit
Saberhagen gave up until Darin Erstad's one-out single in the
sixth.
	   Omar Olivares (5-8) was charged with three runs on only two hits
and matched a season worst with six walks.
	   Tom Gordon blanked Anaheim over the final 1 1-3 innings for his
30th save in 31 chances.
	   Anaheim's Garret Anderson extended his club-record hitting
streak to 28 games _ longest in the majors this season _ with a
leadoff single in the seventh.
 &UR; Athletics 12, Indians 2
	   In Oakland, California, Tom Candiotti got his second win since
May and Matt Stairs homered for the second straight game for
Oakland.
	   Candiotti (6-13), who had lost three straight starts and nine of
his previous 10 decisions, allowed two runs on five hits and four
walks in 5 2-3 innings while striking out a season-high seven.
	   The A's, who won their second straight after a nine-game losing
streak, added four runs in the fourth and six more in the seventh.
	   Oakland won for the fourth time in five games this year against
AL Central-leading Cleveland.
	   David Bell had a two-run single in the sixth to knock out
Candiotti.
	   Bartolo Colon (11-6) allowed five runs on eight hits and three
walks in six innings. He entered the game second in the AL with a
2.74 ERA, and finished with a 2.92 ERA.
	   The Indians, who used outfielder Mark Whiten to pitch the
eighth, had a three-game winning streak snapped.

China will help Asian countries suffering from economic slowdown
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ China has agreed to help Asian
countries suffering from a severe economic crisis, Malaysian
Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said Saturday after holding
talks with his Chinese counterpart.
	   China's foreign minister, Tang Jiaxuan, arrived in Malaysia
Friday for a four day-visit to exchange views with Malaysian
leaders on bilateral relations and international and regional
issues, the Chinese Embassy said in a statement.
	   Abdullah told reporters that his meeting with Tang on Saturday
was ``very productive.''
	   Abdullah said China would take steps to aid Malaysia's economy
by stepping up bilateral trade. He said Tang gave assurances that
China would continue to import palm oil products from Malaysia as
well as increase the trade of essential goods between the two
countries.
	   Tang reiterated China's promise not to devalue its renminbi
currency even though that might have a negative impact for its own
industries.
	   Malaysia said that it continues to support a one-China policy
and that the country's relationship with Taiwan is solely based on
economic ties.
	   Tang will also meet the Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and have
an audience with Malaysia's King Tuanku Ja'affar during his visit.

Seventy countries to take part in Commonwealth Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Solomon Islands has decided to
take part in the 16th Commonwealth games here next month, bringing
the total number of countries to 70, a news report said Saturday.
	   Solomon Islands, a country consisting of a number of islands in
the South Pacific, had earlier said it would not take part in the
Games. No reason was given for the change of heart.
	   The country's decision was conveyed to the Games' organizer
Sukom Ninety Eight Bhd on Friday. The country will send six
athletes, Sukom executive chairman Gen Hashim Mohamed Ali told
reporters.
	   Solomon Islands' decision to participate means all 69
Commonwealth countries will take part in the last Games of this
century. The only non-Commonwealth country to take part is
Kilibati, the national news agency Bernama said.
	   Hashim expects 6,000 athletes and officials at the Kuala Lumpur
Games. In the 1994 Games in Victoria, 57 countries with 3,430
athletes and officials took part.
	   Television rights have been sold for dlrs 20.2 million.

 &UR; China marks Army Day with praise for flood fighters

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China celebrated Army Day with praise Saturday
for the millions of soldiers working to rescue victims of
disastrous flooding and prevent further damage.
	   China's 2.5 million-troop People's Liberation Army, the world's
largest, marked the 71st anniversary of its Aug. 1, 1927 founding
with pledges to further modernize at a ceremony held Friday evening
for the top brass.
	   The military faces increasing financial pressure following an
order by President Jiang Zemin, who is chairman of the Central
Military Commission, to divest its vast business interests and to
crack down on army-sponsored smuggling.
	   A front-page editorial in the Communist Party newspaper People's
Daily lauded the army's ``heroic deeds,'' but also warned military
officers against decadence.
	   ``Officers in the People's Army should take a lead in fighting
against money worshipping, hedonism and out-and-out egoism and
other evil tendencies,'' it said.
	   While moving to restrain corruption within the military, the
ruling Communist Party is making ample use of the army's efforts in
flood rescue and relief to demonstrate its concern for the millions
of China affected by severe flooding this summer that has killed at
least 1,261 people.
	   State-run television and newspapers run daily reports on
lifevest-clad troops struggling in chest-deep waters to shore up
sagging levees with large rocks and sandbags.
	   Almost 4 million soldiers are working to fight floods along the
Yangtze River and in other disaster areas. They have been credited
with rescuing more than 300,000 flood victims and are aiding in
reconstruction efforts, the Xinhua News Agency reported.

Russian premier sets off for semi-secret talks with Chechen leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MAURA REYNOLDS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko set off Saturday
for Russia's troubled Caucasus region to hold unusual and
semi-secret talks with Chechnya's president and independence
leader, Aslan Maskhadov.
	   It will be Maskhadov's first high-level meeting with a Russian
leader since he met with President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow last
August.
	   There has been no official confirmation of the time or the place
of the meeting. Local news agencies, which reported Kiriyenko's
departure, have named the most likely location as Nazran, the
capital of the Russian Caucasus republic of Ingushetia.
	   However, the reports have also said Nazran may be a decoy to
detract attention from the true venue.
	   The meeting is designed in part to express Moscow's support for
Maskhadov. Even though he remains a firm advocate of Chechen
independence, Russia considers him a moderate who is trying to rein
in lawlessness. The Kremlin apparently fears that if Maskhadov's
government falls, a more radical leader could come to power.
	   In an interview with the Interfax news agency on Saturday,
Maskhadov said he would tell Kiriyenko, who became premier in
April, that Russia has failed to meet its obligations to Chechnya
under a peace treaty signed in May 1997.
	   ``The Chechen people are tired of Russia's many promises, which
have remained just that _ promises,'' Maskhadov said.
	   The cease-fire that ended the 1994-1996 Chechen war and the
subsequent treaty did not resolve the vital question of Chechnya's
political status. Chechnya runs its own affairs and considers
itself independent, but Moscow and the rest of the world treats it
as part of Russia.
	   Chechen officials long have accused the Kremlin of failing to
fulfill its promises to rebuild the republic's war-battered
economy.
	   For their part, Russian officials consider Chechnya a prime
source of the violence and crime that plague the Caucasus region.
	   ``The best method of fighting crime is to revive Chechnya's
economy and social sphere, which will cut off the roots of crime,''
Maskhadov told Interfax.
	   The Chechen president, who was elected in a democratic election
in January 1997, declared a month-long state of emergency in June
after a group of gunmen tried to seize the republic's television
center. Conflicts between various armed gangs, sects and ethnic
groups have flared in recent weeks into open clashes.
	   On July 23, Maskhadov narrowly escaped assassination in a car
bombing. He first blamed Russian secret services and their local
allies for the attack, then suggested rival Chechen leaders could
also be involved.
	   Russian military and police troops on Friday completed four days
of military exercises in the region intended to help quell the
increasing violence.

Indian leader puts a positive spin on failed talks with Pakistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's prime minister has put a
positive spin on failed talks with his Pakistani counterpart,
noting that at least the two belligerent neighbors are
communicating.
	   ``My meeting with Pakistan's prime minister has started the
process of resumption of dialogue,'' said Atal Bihari Vajpayee,
returning home Friday from a regional summit in Sri Lanka where he
met privately with Nawaz Sharif. He said India was ``committed to
the path of discourse and discussion.''
	   Vajpayee and Sharif met for the first time since the two
countries conducted nuclear tests in May, a step that significantly
raised the stakes in the 50-year history of Indo-Pakistani
antagonism.
	   Officials said the two leaders are likely to meet again in South
Africa in September when they attend a meeting of nonaligned
countries.
	   Three days of efforts by senior diplomats in the Sri Lankan
capital, Colombo, failed to overcome a procedural wrangle over
negotiating their competing claims to the Himalayan territory of
Kashmir. Pakistan wants them to devote full attention to Kashmir,
believing it to be the key point of contention, while India says
Kashmir should be discussed alongside other differences.
	   It was the same quarrel that aborted negotiations last
September. That breakdown halted formal contacts that had been
revived earlier that year after a three-year hiatus.
	   Vajpayee took a more positive view of the encounter in Sri Lanka
than Sharif, who said it produced ``zero.''
	   The Colombo summit ended in mutual recriminations, with an
Indian spokesman accusing Pakistan of being ``obsessive'' and
``neurotic'' about Kashmir, and Pakistan charging that India was
``rigid and inflexible.''
	   The summit coincided with some of the heaviest cross-border
artillery duels in several years between the Indian and Pakistani
armies in Kashmir, which was the battlefield of full-scale wars in
1947 and 1965.
	   More than 50 people were reported killed and more than 100
wounded on both sides in four days of shelling, most of them
civilians. Dozens of villages were virtually abandoned along the
250-mile (400-kilometer) frontier, known as the Line of Control.

Taliban army reports victories in northern province
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's Taliban army says it has
made gains in fierce fighting in a key northern territory, a
Cabinet minister said Saturday.
	   Interior Minister Mullah Hyrullah Khyrkhaw, who is in charge of
Taliban military operations in northern Faryab province, said his
troops cleared opposition fighters from the districts of Dawlatabad
and Faizabad in fighting over the previous 24 hours. Khyrkhaw said
Taliban forces now control 70 percent of the province.
	   The Taliban official said enemy casualties were high but had no
figures. He made no mention of Taliban casualties.
	   Taliban soldiers captured 500 opposition troops, 60
four-wheel-drive vehicles, eight tanks and a rocket launcher,
Khyrkhaw said.
	   The report from the remote region could not be independently
confirmed. An opposition source, reached by satellite telephone in
northern Afghanistan, said fighting continued in the area and
denied his forces had lost ground. The source refused to be named.
	   Fighting has been fierce in Faryab since early July, when the
Taliban militia said it had taken the province. Since then, both
sides have claimed to have gained ground there.
	   The opposition's strength lies in northern Afghanistan, so it is
fighting hard to stem Taliban advances in the area.
	   The Taliban religious militia, which rules in most of
Afghanistan, has imposed a strict version of Islamic law in
territory it controls.
	   Its opponents includes forces loyal to the military chief
Taliban fighters ousted from Kabul in 1996, Ahmed Shah Masood. The
anti-Taliban coalition is mostly made up of Afghanistan's minority
ethnic and religious groups, factions that sometimes fight each
other as well as the Taliban army.

 &UR; Cuban leader honors emancipation, bombing victims in Barbados &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) _ After a triumphant visit to Jamaica,
Fidel Castro received a more subdued welcome in Barbados, where
some people grumbled about the feting of a man long accused of
suppressing democracy.
	   On the second leg of his Caribbean goodwill tour, the Cuban
leader planned Saturday to honor the emancipation of slaves in
Barbados 160 years ago by joining in a public procession to a
memorial statue of Bussa, leader of a bloody 1816 slave revolt. To
some, Castro's presence was highly symbolic.
	   ``Fidel played a major role in the African liberation struggle
and the liberation struggle in Cuba. That is emancipation,'' said
David Denny, a director of youth programs at the Education Ministry
and head of the local Cuban friendship association.
	   Others, however, questioned the propriety of having Castro mark
Barbadians' emancipation under British colonial rule when his
government jails political dissidents in Cuba.
	   ``What we stand for is 180 degrees from what Fidel Castro stands
for,'' said Sally Cools, a doctor and former radio talk-show host.
``I'm all for trading with Cuba, but not for wining and dining
Fidel Castro.''
	   Several callers to radio stations echoed that sentiment.
	   Such remarks contrasted sharply with the enthusiasm Castro
generated in Jamaica, where his boisterous rallies captured Cuba's
recent reconciliation with Caribbean nations.
	   Several Caribbean heads of state have traveled to Havana over
the past 18 months and many have joined Castro in his diplomatic
offensive against an embargo the United States imposed against his
government 36 year ago.
	   Little fanfare accompanied Castro's visit here, as most
``Bajans'' focused on Cropover, Barbados' rowdy version of
Carnival. Banners strung up on Bridgetown lampposts advertised such
Calypso band competitions as the Pic-O-De-Crop finals at the
national stadium.
	   Castro planned Saturday to dedicate a memorial to the 1976
bombing of a Cuban airliner here that killed 73 people. But even
workers putting finishing touches on the victims' names on a
pyramid-shaped granite memorial said they planned to skip the
dedication there this evening.
	   ``We put a lot of work into this,'' said mason Trevor Eli, 32,
wiping sweat off his brow and sipping a fruit drink to ward off the
tropical heat. ``But Saturday's a day of rest. I'm going to watch
TV.''
	   The Oct. 6, 1976, bombing sent a Cubana Airlines jet plummeting
to the sea in view of horrified tourists and residents and was
blamed on anti-Castro activists.
	   One of them, Luis Posada Carriles, was jailed for nine years in
Venezuela but never convicted of the bombing. Posada recently
claimed responsibility for hotel bombings in Havana last year,
saying he had been helped by Cuban exiles in the United States, but
he later recanted. Castro seized the opportunity to ask U.S.
President Bill Clinton to crack down on U.S.-based Cuban exiles he
accuses of waging terrorism against his homeland.
	   Barbados' Prime Minister Owen Arthur _ who welcomed Clinton at a
Caribbean summit here in May 1997 _ has joined other Caribbean
leaders in criticizing U.S. efforts to isolate Cuba. Arthur also
protested Castro's exclusion from a summit of hemispheric leaders
in Chile this year.
	   Like other area leaders, Arthur has questioned Washington's
commitment to helping small island economies cope with the rapidly
changing demands of a free-trade world.
	   On Sunday, Castro proceeds to Grenada, the third and last stop
of his Caribbean tour. Jamaica, Barbados and Grenada all once
shunned the communist leader but now are leading a campaign to
soften the U.S. position on Cuba.

	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Fidel Castro and his one-time foes in
the Caribbean are burying the hatchet this week. But it's a
different story with Latin America, toward which the Cuban
president seems to harbor a deep grudge.
	   At almost every stop during his triumphant three-day tour of
Jamaica, Castro volunteered an unflattering comment about the
nations of Latin America _ usually related to their shunning of
communism and post-revolutionary Cuba.
	   ``I shall remind you, I cannot ignore it, of when the whole of
Latin America except for Mexico severed relations with Cuba,''
Castro fumed at one point. ``When they became accomplices of the
aggressions against our country and accomplices of the (U.S.)
economic blockade.''
	   He also belittled Latin American health and educational systems
and even blamed those nations for the disproportionate power of the
United States.
	   ``If the rest of Latin America had done what Cuba did,'' he
said, referring to the Communist takeover he led four decades ago,
``we would not be living today in a world of one homogeneous
power,'' Castro told a town hall meeting in Kingston.
	   On the eve of Emancipation Day for former British colonies in
the region, Castro, in mid-praise of the Caribbean states, suddenly
turned his sights on Central and South America.
	   ``Independence and freedom in this hemisphere began with the
struggle put up by the slaves, whereas in Latin America there was
not an awareness or sense of independence,'' he claimed, without
elaborating.
	   Castro's relations with Latin American nations soured after
Washington fully imposed its embargo in 1962. Latin American
nations, with the exception of Mexico, failed to jump to Cuba's
defense, partially because of U.S. pressure. The following year,
the United States successfully got Cuba ousted from the
Organization of American States.
	   Castro, who appears to be angling for admission into the
Caribbean Community, seemed to be suggested he was not ready to
return to the OAS, although some regional leaders are pushing for
it.
	   Several times during his Jamaican visit, he compared Latin
America unfavorably with the Caribbean.
	   ``Latin America has been independent for 200 years. However, the
Caribbean countries, which have been independent for 35 or 40 years
have better rates of education, better health rates.''
	   Castro also stressed that Latin American countries were
conspicuous in not opposing a U.S. challenge to the Caribbean
islands' preferential banana trade with the European Union. The
American move stands to benefit some U.S.-owned plantations in
Central and South America.
	   Despite Castro's ample criticism of Latin America, he pledged to
``defend the cause of the Latin American peoples and countries as
exploited countries, as countries that were kept in poverty and
underdevelopment for so long, as countries that were plundered.''

Islamic militants beat AP reporters outside liberal Iran paper
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Islamic militants Saturday attacked and beat
two Associated Press reporters outside the offices of a liberal
newspaper that has been targeted by Iran's hard-line clergy and
their supporters.
	   Anwar Faruqi, an AP correspondent based in Dubai, suffered cuts
and bruises. Afshin Valinejad, the AP's Tehran reporter, was kicked
in the groin.
	   The two men said they were bruised and shaken but did not
require hospitalization.
	   They had gone to the Tous newspaper after hearing reports that
militants of the Ansar'e Hezbollah had stormed the newspaper's
office and attacked the editor.
	   The newspaper is the latest target in the power struggle between
moderate President Mohammad Khatami, who favors a freer press, and
conservative clergymen in the government who want to maintain
strict control over information.
	   Faruqi, a Pakistani citizen, and Valinejad, an Iranian, had rung
the bell on the compound wall of the newspaper building in a
residential area when about a dozen men standing along the street
rushed at them and told them to leave.
	   When Faruqi asked why, they pounced on him and Valinejad. Faruqi
fell to the ground and about five attackers punched and kicked him.
	   ``Afshin was knocked down. About five of them fell on me and
started kicking me and punching me and kicked me on my neck, my
stomach and legs,'' Faruqi said.
	   He said the attack lasted between five and seven minutes. A few
policemen standing nearby intervened, pulling away the attackers
and giving Faruqi and Valinejad a chance to escape, Faruqi said.
	   There were no other reporters on the scene.
	   It was not immediately clear where the Tous editor, Mahmoud
Shams, was and whether he had been beaten.
	   Tous used to publish under the name Jameah until its license was
revoked last month for publishing what authorities said were
``insults and lies.''
	   However, Shams continued publishing, using the name of Tous, a
provincial newspaper while retaining the staff and the facilities
of Jameah.
	   Jameah came out last year after President Khatami was elected
and quickly became popular for its outspoken views on Iranian
politics.
	   Newspaper licenses are issued by the Ministry of Culture and
Islamic Guidance, headed by a Khatami loyalist, but the power to
revoke licenses rests with the Justice Department, which is
dominated by ultra-conservatives.

American men swimmers defeated by World All-Stars

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late boxing. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ For U.S. men's swimming, it's never
been this bad.
	   Even when American women struggled in the pool with the rise of
East Germany in the 1970s and China in the '90s, the guys always
found a way to win more than their share.
	   With the Olympics coming up in two years, it looks now like the
men's team has a long way to go to catch up with the women, who are
undefeated in two Goodwill Games dual meets. The men are 0-2 after
a 78-43 thrashing by a World All-Star team Friday night.
	   ``I saw my mom in the stands and she made eye contact with me
and said, `Good job,''' said Bill Pilczuk of Auburn, Alabama, a
world champion this year in the 50-meter freestyle, but third to
two World teamers. ``I just rolled my eyes and said `Sheesh.'''
	   Wednesday's loss to Germany was painful. This time, the defeat
was downright embarrassing, with six 1-2 sweeps by the World team
in 12 individual events.
	   ``Americans come in to win every race, every day,'' said Josh
Davis of San Antonio, one of the few U.S. winners. ``Wednesday was
just a bad day in the office. It was an off day. We pride ourselves
on having one of the strongest swimming programs.''
	   The Americans, who lost to Germany on the final race, the
400-meter freestyle relay _ an event they've won at every Olympics
_ started OK against the World team by winning the 400 medley relay
for a 7-0 lead.
	   But the World team then went 1-2 in five of the next seven
events for a 46-24 lead that the Americans never challenged. Among
the sweeps was in the 50 freestyle, where Pilczuk finished third
behind Lorenzo Vismara of Italy and Ricardo Busquets of Puerto
Rico.
	   ``I would've liked to have another meet where it came down to
the free relay, but it didn't work out that way,'' U.S. men's coach
Bill Wadley said.
	   U.S. men traditionally included a wealth of speedy freestylers,
but the embarrassment in the sprints continued with another World
sweep in the 100.
	   Fernando Scherer of Brazil became the fourth man in history to
break 49 seconds in the event, joining Americans Matt Biondi and
Gary Hall Jr., and Russian Aleksandr Popov, the world record-holder
at 48.21 seconds. Scherer was timed in 48.91, and Pieter van den
Hoogenband of the Netherlands was second in 49.61.
	   ``I knew I had swum a great race when I finished, but I wasn't
sure how good my time would be,'' said Scherer, who was fifth in
the Olympic 100 free two years ago. ``I felt great until the last 5
meters, when my legs felt dead.''
	   The final indignity came in the 400 freestyle relay, as the
World team, anchored by Scherer, won in 3:22.42 _ 2.73 seconds
ahead of the Americans.
	   ``This is the fastest pool I've ever been in,'' Scherer said.
	   Few Americans would agree, but there were a few U.S. highlights.
	   World champion Lenny Krayzelburg of Los Angeles won the 200
backstroke in 1:58.17, a Goodwill record and the ninth-fastest time
in history. Davis captured the 200 freestyle and Kurt Grote of San
Diego, California won the 100 breaststroke.
	   ``The World team is a lot stronger than the rest of the
competition,'' Davis said. ``They have an advantage because they
have some of the best in the world mixed on one team.''
	   Todd Eldredge, the former world champion from the United States,
won the gold men in men's figure skating with a string of 5.8s and
5.9s. Russians Alexei Urmanov and Evgeni Plushenko were 2-3.
	   World champions Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze of
Russia won the gold medal in pairs figure skating, beating
archrivals Artur Dmitriev and Oksana Kazakova. The bronze went to
Dorota Zagorska and Mariusz Siudek of Poland.
	   Cuban boxers _ led by Felix Savon's one-punch knockout of
American heavyweight DaVarryl Williamson of Aurora, Illinois, in
the first round. _ won four of their five gold-medal bouts. Mario
Kindelan defeated Jacob Hudson of Augusta, Georgia, for the
lightweight title, 13-4. Light flyweight Maikro Romero beat Aleksan
Nalbaniyan of Russia 10-5, before Timur Tulyakov of Uzbekistan beat
world championship silver medalist Waldemar Font 15-14.
	   All three American finalists lost, with19-year-old Andrei Mishin
of Russia outpointing 18-year-old Larry Mosley of Los Angeles 11-3
in the 147-pound final.
	   Meanwhile, four referees and judges accused of bias against
Russian boxers were suspended by AIBA, the international amateur
boxing federation.
	   Kicked out of the games were referee-judges Macario Sosa of
Guatemala and Alfredo Toledo of Cuba; referee Per-Olaf Larsson of
Sweden; and judge Dieter Mika of Germany.
	   There will be a new champion in women's beach volleyball.
Defending gold medalists Karolyn Kirby and Liz Masakayan of San
Diego lost to Brazil's top-seeded Shelda Bede and Adriana Behar
15-9.
	   Bede and Behar scored nine straight points for a 10-1 lead, then
four of the last five points to wrap it up. In between, the U.S.
pair scored seven of eight points with play that brought back
visions of their days at the top: an ace, three kills and a block
by Kirby, and pressure behind Masakayan's serve.
	   ``Once we started getting points, it was really the old Liz and
Karolyn started coming back, where we started gaining some
confidence and we had something we could work with,'' the
37-year-old Kirby said. ``It's just too bad we didn't think of that
a little bit earlier.''
	   Masakayan and Kirby's last chance of advancing to Saturday's
semifinals ended when Pauline Manser and Kerri Pottharst of
Australia beat winless Kristine Drakich and Guylaine Dumont of
Canada 15-8.
	   Also reaching the final four were Americans Holly McPeak and
Lisa Arce, who beat Maike Friedrichsen and Danja Musch of Germany
15-11, and Italy's Laura Bruschini and Annamaria Solazzi.

	   TAKHMAU, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian leader Hun Sen said Saturday
that a former Khmer Rouge general wanted for the abduction and
murder of three Western tourists in 1994 has been arrested and will
stand trial in Phnom Penh.
	   ``This is a success for our national police,'' Hun Sen told
reporters at his residence after briefing the ambassadors from
France, Britain and Australia about the arrest. ``We asked those
countries to send lawyers on behalf of those victims for the
trial.''
	   Nuon Paet led a band of Khmer Rouge guerrillas who halted a
train in 1994 and abducted three young Western tourists: David
Wilson of Australia, Mark Slater of Britain and Jean-Michel Braquet
of France.
	   The guerrillas, holed up on rugged Vine Mountain in the southern
province of Kampot, held three months of protracted negotiations
with the government before killing their captives.
	   The case had caused considerable controversy, especially in
Australia, because it was believed that the Cambodian government
had mishandled the negotiations.
	   There was also criticism that the government for at least the
past year had been aware of Nuon Paet's whereabouts but was
unwilling to apprehend him.
	   ``The sooner the trial takes place the better,'' said Hun Sen,
who appeared relaxed and happy, adding that the ambassadors
expressed ``satisfaction'' at news of the arrest.
	   Hun Sen said that the trial should take place in Phnom Penh for
security reasons. Nuon Paet was detained by criminal police when
his car was stopped on the road from Phnom Penh International
Airport to the capital early Saturday.
	   He looked upset as he was escorted in handcuffs by heavily armed
police to a jail behind the municipal police station pending court
procedures.
	   ``According to the latest information, Nuon Paet disguised
himself in an army uniform or as a trader,'' said Hun Sen, speaking
about the notorious guerrilla's recent activities.
	   He said that he had been ``active in the area between the Thai
border and Pailin,'' smuggling cars from Thailand. Pailin is a
former Khmer Rouge stronghold on Cambodia's western border.
	   Sim Theng, a former Khmer Rouge division commander, told The
Associated Press last year that Nuon Paet had disguised himself and
attempted to defect among the estimated 10,000 guerrillas who have
laid down their arms since August, 1996.
	   The defections, initiated by high-ranking Khmer Rouge figure
Ieng Sary, crippled the revolutionary movement and have given the
country its best chance for peace in decades.
	   The Khmer Rouge seized power in 1975 and killed as many as 2
million Cambodians in a bid to create a communist agrarian utopia.
It battled successive central governments after it was overthrown
in 1979 by a Vietnamese invasion.
	   At least 10 foreigners have been taken hostage and subsequently
killed by Khmer Rouge guerrillas since 1994. Only one, American
Melissa Himes, escaped unharmed.
	   The arrest of Nuon Paet comes less than a week after Cambodia
held parliamentary elections and a year after Hun Sen ousted Prince
Norodom Ranariddh as his co-premier in a bloody coup d'etat.
	   Hun Sen, who according to preliminary results won the elections,
hopes the poll will bring back aid and international legitimacy
lost after his violent takeover.

Cubans win two of first three golds
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ED SCHUYLER JR. &QC; 
 &UR; AP Boxing Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Felix Savon of Cuba wrote another brief but
stunning chapter to his heavyweight career with a one-punch
knockout of American DaVarryl Williamson on Friday night in the
Goodwill Games.
	   Savon, 30, was backed up by a left hand to the head from the
29-year-old Williamson. But as Williamson tried to throw a right,
Savon put every ounce of his vaunted power into a right of his own
that knocked his opponent down and out with 1:05 left in the first
round.
	   It was the third Goodwill games championship for the 201-pound
(91.17-kilo) Savon to go along with two Olympic titles, four world
championships and a Pan American Games title.
	   Savon's stunning victory in The Theater at Madison Square Garden
was the fourth in five finals for the Cubans Friday night. The loss
for Williamson, of Aurora, Illinois, meant that all three American
finalists on Friday's card were beaten.
	   Savon's victory also gave the Cubans a 7-3 margin over American
boxers in head-to-head meetings in this competition.
	   The Cubans will try to win three more titles Saturday night.
Also in Saturday finals will be Roberto Benitez, 112 (50.80 kilos),
of Marquette, Michigan; Teaunce Shepherd, 125 (56.70 kilos), also
of Marquette; and Olanda Anderson, 178 (80.74 kilos), of Fort
Carson, Colorado, and an all-American match at 139 (63.05 kilos) of
Ebo Elder of Newman, Georgia, and Ricardo Williams Jr. of
Cincinnati.
	   The first American victim Friday night was 19-year-old Jacob
Hudson of Augusta, Ga., who lost 13-4 in the 132-pound (59.87-kilo)
final to Mario Kindelan.
	   Hudson held his own for the first three of five two-minute
rounds, but the left-handed Cuban took complete charge in the
fourth round, landing several right hooks to build a 10-4 lead.
	   The Americans suffered another defeat when 19-year-old Andrei
Mishin of Russia outpointed 18-year-old Larry Mosley of Los Angeles
11-3 in the 147-pound (66.68-kilo) final.
	   Mosley, a U.S. national champion, appeared tight in the early
rounds and simply could not solve the defense of Mishin, who scored
effectively with right jabs and hooks.
	   Russian team officials had threatened to withdraw their four
finalists _ two will fight Saturday night _ because they were upset
about losing several close decisions earlier in the tournament. The
International Amateur Boxing Association then suspended two
referee-judges, a referee and a judge, and the Russians didn't go
through with their threat.
	   The first Cuban to win was Maikro Romero, a 25-year-old Olympic
champion and reigning world champion. He was just too slick and
powerful for Aleksan Nalbaniyan of Russia and scored a 10-5
decision at 106 pounds (48.08 kilos).
	   The Cubans suffered a loss at 119 pounds (53.98 kilos) in
dramatic fashion. Timur Tulyakov of Uzbekistan was trailing
Waldemar Font 14-13 when he evened the score with a right to the
head with 15 seconds remaining and won 15-14 with another right to
the head just before the bell.
	   The other Cuban winner was Ariel Hernandez, a two-time Olympic
champion who overcame a two-point penalty for holding in the fifth
round and edged Jean-Paul Mendy of France 15-14 in the 165-pound
(74.84 kilos) final.
	   The two left-handers exchanged some rocking head blows,
especially in the final two rounds. Hernandez led 6-2 after three
rounds but then Mendy rallied to tie it 10-10 after four. After the
penalty made it 12-12 in the final round, Hernandez scored two
quick points to clinch the bout.

Doctors hope Chinese gymnast will become self-sufficient
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Doctors hope paralyzed Chinese gymnast Sang Lan
will one day be able to care for herself.
	   Sang began rehabilitation Friday at Mount Sinai Hospital in
Manhattan, where doctors and therapists will work with the
17-year-old to return her to as normal a life as possible.
	   ``We hope that she will eventually be able to turn herself over
in bed, use a wheelchair and ... take a shower,'' Dr. Kristjan T.
Ragnarsson said.
	   ``From the medical point of view, the chances of her gaining
strength in her legs is poor. That doesn't mean there isn't hope.''
	   Sang broke her neck during a Goodwill Games warmup vault at the
Nassau Coliseum on July 21. She underwent surgery last Saturday,
but has little sensation from the chest down.
	   Sang is expected to stay at Mount Sinai for at least two months,
undergoing rigorous physical therapy and receiving mental health
counseling to help her cope with her injury.
	   ``She will be seen by ... psychologists to help'' her deal with
the rigors of rehabilitation as well as ``separation anxiety'' she
might experience when her teammates depart at the end of the
Goodwill Games on Sunday, Ragnarrson said.
	   Sang, China's 1997 national vault champion, will also continue
to take an experimental nerve-building drug. But doctors have
warned against calling it a miracle cure.
	   Ragnarsson is the same doctor who treated former New York Jets
defensive lineman Dennis Byrd. The football player recovered six
years ago from paralysis after breaking his neck.
	   But Sang's injuries were more severe than Byrd's, the doctor
said. Byrd had feeling in his legs almost immediately after the
injury, and Sang has no feeling in her lower body.
	   Despite the diagnosis, Ragnarsson said Sang's spirits remain
high.
	   She has requested traditional Chinese food, and the hospital has
provided space for her parents to cook the meals.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Defending champions Karolyn Kirby and Liz
Masakayan were eliminated, losing to top-ranked Brazilians Shelda
Bede and Adriana Behar 15-9. Bede and Behar ran off nine straight
points largely for a 10-1 lead, then scored four of the last five
points to wrap it up. Masakayan and Kirby's ;last chance to advance
ended when Pauline Manser and Kerri Pottharst of Australia beat
winless Kristine Drakich and Guylaine Dumont of Canada 15-8. Also
reaching the final four were Americans Holly McPeak and Lisa Arce,
who beat Maike Friedrichsen and Danja Musch of Germany 15-11, and
Italy's Laura Bruschini and Annamaria Solazzi.

 &UR; Boxing &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Felix Savon of Cuba won the heavyweight gold
medal with a one-punch knockout of American DaVarryl Williamson in
the first round.
	   It was the third Goodwill games championship for the 201-pound
(91.17-kilo) Savon to go along with two Olympic titles, four world
championships and a Pan American Games title.
	   Savon's stunning victory was the fourth in five finals for the
Cubans. The loss by Williamson meant all three American finalists
were beaten.
	   Cuban boxers split the first two gold-medal bouts. Light
flyweight Maikro Romero beat Aleksan Nalbaniyan of Russia 10-5,
before Timur Tulyakov of Uzbekistan beat world championship silver
medalist Waldemar Font 15-14.
	   Jacob Hudson, Hudson, a U.S. champion, lost 13-4 in the
132-pound (59.87-kilo) final to Mario Kindelan.
	   The Americans suffered another defeat when 19-year-old Andrei

11-3 in the 147-pound (66.68-kilo) final.

	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ Todd Eldredge added a Goodwill Games
gold to his collection of medals. Eldredge completed his personal
progression, clinching the men's singles with a brilliant free
skate. He already had Goodwill bronze from 1990 and silver from
1994. The silver medal went to Alexei Urmanov and the bronze to
Evgeni Plushenko, both of Russia. Timothy Goebel, the only American
ever to land a quad in competition, did it again with a salchow
that helped lift him to fifth. World champions Elena Berezhnaya and
Anton Sikharulidze of Russia won the pairs gold medal, beating
Olympic champions Artur Dmitriev and Oksana Kazakova.

 &UR; Swimming &QC; 
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ A team of World All-Stars used six
1-2 sweeps in individual events to hand the U.S. men a 78-43 loss.
The Americans, who narrowly lost to Germany when they were defeated
in the 400-meter freestyle relay _ an event they've won at every
Olympics _ started OK against the World team by winning the 400
medley relay for a 7-0 lead. But the World team then went 1-2 in
five of the next seven events for a 46-24 lead that the Americans
never challenged. Among the sweeps was in the 50 freestyle, where
world champion Bill Pilczuk of Auburn, Alabama, finished third
behind Lorenzo Vismara of Italy and Ricardo Busquets of Puerto
Rico. U.S. men traditionally have had a wealth of speedy
freestylers, but the embarrassment in the sprints continued with
another sweep by the World All-Stars in the 100.

Packers-Chiefs to start star players in Tokyo exhibition game
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos TOK101-105
 &UR; By CHESTER DAWSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Kansas City star quarterback Elvis Grbac says he's
ready to start for the Chiefs in an exhibition game on Sunday
against the Green Bay Packers after recovering from a sore back
which threatened to sideline him.
	   Grbac, who signed a dlrs 20 million free-agent contract with the
Chiefs last season, complained of back pain just before departing
for the American Bowl in Tokyo, apparently from beds used during
training camp.
	   ``I was a little stiff for a little while and it was a concern,
but I feel fine and I'm ready to go,'' Grbac told The Associated
Press early Saturday before a short practice session. ``I feel
comfortable about going out there and doing what I have to do.''
	   Kansas City head coach Marty Schottenheimer told reporters
Saturday he plans to use his starters in the first quarter, then
bring in younger players eager to prove themselves on the field.
	   ``The play will be very typical of a preseason game,'' he said.
	   Packers head coach Mike Holmgren, meanwhile, said he plans to
start top Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre on Sunday, then give
each of his three backup quarterbacks one of the remaining three
quarters to play.
	   Favre, a two-time National Football League Most Valuable Player
award winner, signed a seven-year contract extension with the
Packers last year worth more than dlrs 42 million.
	   Both coaches said jet lag from the half-day-long flight to Japan
earlier this week shouldn't be a big factor in the game, the NFL's
ninth American Bowl game in Tokyo.
	   ``That's an excuse,'' said Packers coach Holmgren, saying he
told players at an early morning meeting Saturday to ``cut the
baloney'' about being overtired.
	   One person in need of an energetic performance in Tokyo is Green
Bay's new No. 2 quarterback Doug Pederson, who struggled in
training camp. The mixed showing raised concerns over his April
promotion to a job just one step away from leading the two-time
defending NFC champions.
	   ``His role has changed so there's a little more urgency in what
he does on the field,'' Holmgren said Saturday, adding ``I expect
him to play well.''
	   While younger Packers players such as second year pro Darren
Sharper, a free safety, will have plenty of playing time, the game
should be short and sweet for veteran players like defensive end
Reggie White.
	   Holmgren expressed confidence in White's ability to have a
banner year after a bad back forced his brief retirement in the off
season.
	   ``He's off to a real good start,'' Holmgren said. ``If he can
play at the level he's used to without pain _ without a lot of pain
_ he could have a great year.''
	   White, for his part, said he felt good and predicted the team
will benefit from input by younger players such as Vonnie Holliday,
a first-round draft pick from North Carolina and rookie defensive
end.
	   ``I think we're going to be better than we were last year,'' he
said.
	   In January, the Denver Broncos beat the Packers in a 31-24 upset
Super Bowl game.
	   Sunday's American Bowl in Tokyo has been billed both as a
rematch between the two teams that played in the first Super Bowl
back in 1966, and a possible preview of the next league
championship game in Miami.

Lawyers tap into anger over Sydney's water crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to raise Saturday developments. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ While experts tried to determine if the
water in Australia's largest city was safe to drink again, lawyers
on Saturday tapped into public anger with newspaper advertisements
recruiting clients for a lawsuit against the local water agency.
	   Authorities have admitted failing to issue immediate warnings to
consumers after the dangerous parasites giardia and cryptosporidium
were found in Sydney's water system Wednesday and Thursday.
	   New South Wales State Urban Affairs and Planning Minister Craig
Knowles said Saturday the latest water tests were encouraging and
some parts of the city may be able to drink their tap water again
by Sunday.
	   Until then, the city's 3.7 million inhabitants have been advised
to boil water for drinking and cooking; retailers have reported a
300-percent jump in sales of bottled water.
	   The breakdown of the water system is a blow to Sydney, a city
widely praised for its modernity, often exemplified by the sweeping
roof of the harborfront Sydney Opera House. The fiasco has set off
street protests by angry city residents and recriminations among
officials.
	   Sydney's water mains have been opened, and the system was being
flushed, sending water rushing through city streets. But Knowles
said the government would not take Sydney Water's word on whether
the water was safe, and instead would convene an independent
committee of microbiologists.
	   Prime Minister John Howard said the tainted water was an
international embarrassment for the city that will host the
Olympics in two years.
	   Added federal Sports Minister Andrew Thompson: ``Having gone to
the trouble of winning the Olympics, the very least a state
government could do is make sure that the water is not poisonous.''
	   Meanwhile, an independent inquiry set up by the government has
begun examining why only southern Sydney residents were warned
about the contamination on Thursday, even though the filtration
plant at fault served all of Sydney.
	   Public ire over the water fiasco has reached a boiling point. A
Sydney Water repair crew fixing broken pipes was pelted with stones
Friday, the Australian Services Union said. No one was hurt.
	   With law firms soliciting clients for a class action suit
against Sydney Water, one firm _ Slater and Gordon _ said the
agency would likely have to pay out tens of millions of dollars in
claims for the disruption.
	   The cause of the contamination is unclear. Officials said animal
carcasses _ dogs and foxes _ were found either in or near an open
canal leading to the filtration plant that distributes water
citywide. But it has not been shown that the animal remains were
the source of the polluted water.
	   Sydney Water Managing Director Chris Pollett has said the
contamination may have come from run-off that already had been
contaminated with parasites.
	   Chief Health Department officer Dr. Andrew Wilson said there had
been no confirmed reports of illness from the water. But the
parasites have an incubation period of about a week, so any serious
health problems were expected to develop next week.
	   Giardia, normally spread through human or animal fecal matter,
can cause diarrhea and other gastrointestinal problems.
Cryptosporidium is spread in similar fashion. It causes flu-like
symptoms and can kill people with weak immune systems, including
the very young and the elderly.
	   Cryptosporidium got into the water supply of Milwaukee,
Wisconsin, in 1993, killing about 100 people. More than 400,000
others were sickened.
	   Sydney Water revealed that the water treatment plant did not
filter for giardia, a situation described as farcical by state
opposition leader Peter Collins.
	   ``You've got Sydney Water saying `But we've complied with the
guidelines' _ the problem is you can't drink the water that's
provided under the guidelines,'' he said.

Helicopter crash kills four in southern Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A helicopter crashed outside the south-central
city of Penza, killing four people, a news agency reported
Saturday.
	   The accident occurred around 6 p.m. (1400 GMT) Friday at the
Sosnovka airport in the Penza region, about 550 kilometers (350
miles) southeast of Moscow, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported
citing the Emergencies Ministry.
	   A preliminary investigation has blamed the crash on pilot error,
the report said without proving additional detail.
	   The report did not say who owned the helicopter or give further
information about the victims.
	   The Mi-2 can carry eight passengers plus one or two crew
members.

</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from election watchdog, details thruout &QL; 
intimidation &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TAKHMAU, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian leader Hun Sen on Saturday
called on his security forces not to terrorize members of the
opposition following last Sunday's parliamentary elections.
	   ``My appeal is that there must not be any intimidation,'' Hun
Sen told reporters at his home just south of the capital. His
comments were aired on state-run television Saturday afternoon.
	   ``If carried out by anyone, that person must be arrested and
punished according to the law,'' he said. ``This kind of thing is
dangerous.''
	   Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh as his co-premier in a violent coup
d'etat a year ago, dismantling much of his political machine in the
process. Hun Sen hopes that the elections will bring a return to
political stability, as well as restore his legitimacy in the eyes
of the international community and foreign aid suspended after his
takeover.
	   The human rights situation in Cambodia has deteriorated since
Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party apparently won the polls,
triggering fear of retribution by his forces against those who
challenged him. Complete official results have yet to be released.
	   Scores of supporters of Prince Norodom Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC
party and the Sam Rainsy Party have fled Cambodia's rural areas to
Phnom Penh, seeking refuge at their parties' headquarters.
	   ``Any act to intimidate anyone is illegal, immoral and
unforgivable,'' Hun Sen said. ``It doesn't matter if they voted for
us, against us, or even cursed us ... There must not be any
retribution.''
	   The president of Cambodia's biggest independent poll-watching
group, the Committee for Free and Fair Elections in Cambodia, also
expressed concern about post-election violence and intimidation
directed against members of opposition parties.
	   Thun Saray said Saturday that he had received reports from the
provinces of Takeo, Kampong Cham and Prey Veng of 29 political
party activists who had been threatened since the election.
	   ``These incidents were mostly direct verbal threats but included
other forms of intimidating behavior,'' he said, speculating that
in some cases ruling party supporters were proud of their victory
and wanted to show off their new strength and influence.
	   The two main opposition parties on Friday also called on Hun
Sen's ruling party to immediately end ``the campaign of
intimidation it has mounted against our activists in villages and
communes across Cambodia.''
	   ``The testimony of these activists, many of whom are
eyewitnesses to electoral fraud, is essential to an assessment of
the election results,'' said the statement from the FUNCINPEC and
Sam Rainsy parties.

Australia hands New Zealand third straight loss to clinch series
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with quotes, new material throughout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP) _ Australian captain John Eales
called it Australia's greatest performance since winning rugby
union's World Cup in 1991.
	   The Wallabies' 27-23 win over New Zealand on Saturday to clinch
the Bledisloe Cup, emblematic of the countries' fierce and
traditional rivalry, was also the first victory by Australia at
Lancaster Park in 40 years.
	   ``A lot of the guys in the team didn't know what it was like to
win here,'' Eales said. ``We'll certainly enjoy this occasion.''
	   Australia had not won a rugby union test in New Zealand since
1990.
	   New Zealand scored two late tries _ from Christian Cullen and
Jonah Lomu _ to make the finish close in a match that Australia
dominated. It was the All Blacks' third consecutive loss, the first
time they've lost three in a row since 1949.
	   ``We had a game plan and we stuck to it for most of the match,''
said Eales. ``It's too bad about the two late tries but we came
here to win the Bledisloe Cup and we did it.''
	   Australia, which beat New Zealand 24-16 at Melbourne on July 11,
clinched the three-match series with a match to play in Sydney
later this month. The Wallabies had not won the Bledisloe Cup since
taking a on-off test in Sydney in 1994.
	   The win moved Australia into the lead in the Tri Nations series
with a match to be played against second-place South Africa in
Johannesburg on Aug. 22. New Zealand closes out the series a week
earlier in Durban against South Africa.
	   The win prompted Wallaby flanker David Wilson to suggest that
rugby's strength had moved away from the All Blacks to Australia
and the Springboks.
	   ``I think that power's shifted now,'' said Wilson. ``It's
between us and South Africa and our match in South Africa will
decide that.''
	   New Zealand coach John Hart offered no excuses for the defeat.
	   ``It's really a disappointing time for us, three losses on end
and losing the Bledisloe Cup is a major blow to our confidence,''
he said.
	   ``We realize the Australians played very well. I thought their
intensity throughout the game was very good. Our defense, we fell
off a few tackles and they took their chances. We were outplayed on
the day.''
	   The All Blacks, rebuilding after the loss of Zinzan Brooke, Sean
Fitzpatrick and Frank Bunce, felt they could have won their
previous two tests had goal kicking been more accurate.
	   But Hart conceded they couldn't have won Saturday's game from
the outset as Australia started both halves superbly, scoring a try
early in each to start their momentum before taking a firm grip on
proceedings.
	   ``Everything we tried today turned to rust,'' a dejected New
Zealand captain Taine Randell said.
	   The Australians tackled magnificently, absorbed enormous
pressure on two occasions before the All Blacks tries and attacked
the New Zealanders by recycling ball quickly and making inroads.
	   The Wallabies led 10-3 at halftime having scored two tries to
none, the only All Black score from a penalty goal to five-eighth
Andrew Mehrtens.
	   Second-rower Tom Bowman scored his first test try after six
minutes and fullback Matthew Burke crossed with just over a minute
left in a dominant Australian performance.
	   Scores:
	   AUSTRALIA 27 (Tom Bowman, Matthew Burke, Jason Little, Stephen
Larkham tries; John Eales 2 conversions, Matthew Burke penalty)
def. NEW ZEALAND 23 (Christian Cullen, Jonah Lomu tries; Andrew
Mehrtens 2 conversions, 3 penalties). (djp)

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Police searched the fog-shrouded hills of Russia's
Chukotka Peninsula on Saturday for three inmates still at large
after a prison break, news agencies reported.
	   The Chukotka peninsula extends into the Bering Strait is the
point of land closest to the U.S. state of Alaska.
	   A total of 11 convicts killed a police officer and stole a large
number of weapons before escaping from the prison Friday and
fleeing in two stolen trucks and an armored vehicle.
	   Two of the convicts and two more police were killed in a
shootout as officers tried to corral the fugitives with armored
vehicles and helicopters, the Interfax news agency reported. A
third fugitive committed suicide.
	   Of the rest, five were captured and three remain at large, news
agencies reported.
	   Six of the 11 escapees were active-duty soldiers jailed on
murder charges. The other five were civilians convicted of rape and
robbery. It was not clear which of the inmates were still at large.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Solomon Islands has decided to
take part in the 16th Commonwealth games here next month, bringing
the total number of countries to 70, a news report said Saturday.
	   Solomon Islands, a country consisting of a number of islands in
the South Pacific, had earlier said it would not take part in the
Games. No reason was given for the change of heart.
	   The country's decision was conveyed to the Games' organizer
Sukom Ninety Eight Bhd on Friday. The country will send six
athletes, Sukom executive chairman Gen Hashim Mohamed Ali told
reporters.
	   Solomon Islands' decision to participate means all 70
Commonwealth countries will take part in the last Games of this
century.
	   Kiribati, which is a Commonwealth country but not yet a member
of the Commonwealth Games Federation, will participate, the
national news agency Bernama said.
	   It will formally be accepted by the federation Aug. 8th, three
days before the games begin.
	   Hashim expects 6,000 athletes and officials at the Kuala Lumpur
Games. In the 1994 Games in Victoria, 57 countries with 3,430
athletes and officials took part.

Chief Executive wants closer relations with legislature
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ In an effort to ease relations with Hong Kong's
legislators, Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa met with lawmakers to
discuss the economy, which has been hit hard by the Asian financial
turmoil.
	   Saturday's meeting came one day after Tung met with 11 other
lawmakers and assured them that the government wants a relationship
with the legislature based on mutual trust and cooperation.
	   A government statement said Tung told lawmakers on Saturday that
Hong Kong has to undergo a ``painful adjustment'' in order to
maintain the territory's competitiveness.
	   Hong Kong's economy shrank 2 percent in the first quarter this
year, the first contraction in 14 years, while unemployment climbed
to a 15-year high of 4.5 percent in the three months ended June 30.
	   Relations between the executive and the newly elected
legislature soured when legislators voted against a government
proposal early this week to scrap two local councils chosen by
fully democratic means.
	   Some legislators have accused the executive branch of curbing
democracy in the territory, where a handful of civil servants and a
group of appointed advisers are largely responsible for making
policies. The partially elected legislature acts mainly as a body
to monitor the government.
	   Fred Li, a lawmaker of the Democratic Party, which won 13 seats
in the 60-member legislature in the May elections, said relations
with executive were tense because the government was not sure how
the Democrats would act in the legislative body. The Democrats did
not serve on the Beijing-backed provisional legislature that
functioned for 11 months following Hong Kong's return to Chinese
rule last year.
	   In a commentary in Friday's South China Morning Post,
independent legislator Margaret Ng, one of Tung's most vocal
critics, accused the government of ``dismantling democracy, (and)
taking power long since given to the people.''
	   Tung said Friday that the legislature's rules of procedure
should be consistent with Beijing's Basic Law or constitution for
the territory.
	   China has promised to maintain Hong Kong's present legal and
capitalistic systems for 50 years.

Cambodian leader calls on security forces to refrain from
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix order of overline and editor's note
intimidation
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from election watchdog, details thruout

<TEXT>
	   TAKHMAU, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian leader Hun Sen on Saturday
called on his security forces not to terrorize members of the
opposition following last Sunday's parliamentary elections.
	   ``My appeal is that there must not be any intimidation,'' Hun
Sen told reporters at his home just south of the capital. His
comments were aired on state-run television Saturday afternoon.
	   ``If carried out by anyone, that person must be arrested and
punished according to the law,'' he said. ``This kind of thing is
dangerous.''
	   Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh as his co-premier in a violent coup
d'etat a year ago, dismantling much of his political machine in the
process. Hun Sen hopes that the elections will bring a return to
political stability, as well as restore his legitimacy in the eyes
of the international community and foreign aid suspended after his
takeover.
	   The human rights situation in Cambodia has deteriorated since
Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party apparently won the polls,
triggering fear of retribution by his forces against those who
challenged him. Complete official results have yet to be released.
	   Scores of supporters of Prince Norodom Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC
party and the Sam Rainsy Party have fled Cambodia's rural areas to
Phnom Penh, seeking refuge at their parties' headquarters.
	   ``Any act to intimidate anyone is illegal, immoral and
unforgivable,'' Hun Sen said. ``It doesn't matter if they voted for
us, against us, or even cursed us ... There must not be any
retribution.''
	   The president of Cambodia's biggest independent poll-watching
group, the Committee for Free and Fair Elections in Cambodia, also
expressed concern about post-election violence and intimidation
directed against members of opposition parties.
	   Thun Saray said Saturday that he had received reports from the
provinces of Takeo, Kampong Cham and Prey Veng of 29 political
party activists who had been threatened since the election.
	   ``These incidents were mostly direct verbal threats but included
other forms of intimidating behavior,'' he said, speculating that
in some cases ruling party supporters were proud of their victory
and wanted to show off their new strength and influence.
	   The two main opposition parties on Friday also called on Hun
Sen's ruling party to immediately end ``the campaign of
intimidation it has mounted against our activists in villages and
communes across Cambodia.''
	   ``The testimony of these activists, many of whom are
eyewitnesses to electoral fraud, is essential to an assessment of
the election results,'' said the statement from the FUNCINPEC and
Sam Rainsy parties.

U.S. defense secretary urges Indonesia to stick with reforms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Cohen news conference.
 &UR; AP Photos Available
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen
on Saturday urged Indonesia's leadership to push ahead with
democratic reforms and efforts to rebuild its shattered economy.
	   In meetings with President B.J. Habibie and top military brass,
Cohen also appealed for swift investigations of alleged human
rights abuses by Indonesian military units, some of them
U.S.-trained.
	   ``It's important that such investigations be carried out openly,
honestly and with integrity,'' Cohen said at a news conference at
the Indonesian defense ministry.
	   The Indonesian military has been tainted by its involvement in
the kidnapping of pro-democracy activists earlier this year, while
former President Suharto was still in power. Eleven members of an
elite army unit have been arrested.
	   Also, 18 police have been implicated in the killings of four
student demonstrators in May, an incident that triggered deadly
rioting in Jakarta and helped oust Suharto.
	   Habibie has pledged to undo Suharto's authoritarian legacy,
planning general elections next year and allowing trade unions and
political parties to form. Indonesia is overhauling its paralyzed
economy with the help of billions of dollars in international aid.
	   ``We are encouraged by what we see taking place, the commitment
of your president to implementing democratic reforms, to striving
to rebuild the economy,'' Cohen said. ``We are eager to be of
assistance in any form that we can.''
	   Anxious to prevent further unrest in the archipelago nation of
200 million, the United States is donating rice and wheat to
Indonesia to help the rapidly growing number of poor. Indonesia
sank into economic turmoil last year with the onset of Asia's
currency crisis.
	   Cohen did not comment on any plans to resume joint U.S. military
training in Indonesia, which was suspended in May because of the
political upheaval.
	   Cohen arrived in Jakarta late Friday from Sydney, where he and
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright took part in annual
talks on U.S.-Australian relations.
	   On Sunday, he planned to fly to the Philippines, the next leg on
his regional tour.
	   Cohen last visited Jakarta in January, when he told Suharto that
the United States saw Indonesia as a key to political and military
stability in Southeast Asia.
	   After talks Saturday with the new government, he repeated his
earlier message.
	   ``Indonesia is a very important country,'' Cohen said. ``What
takes place in Indonesia will have an impact throughout the
region.''

Pakistan says 80 killed in Indian shelling
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photos ISL103-105 &QL; 
 &UR; By DONNA BRYSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan suffered heavy military
casualties from a three-day bombardment in territory where it has
overlapping claims with India, a Pakistani Cabinet minister said
Saturday.
	   Majeed Malik, the minister in charge of policy on disputed
Kashmir, said 37 soldiers were among a total of 80 Pakistanis
killed in shelling by Indian troops that he said was part of New
Delhi's plan to derail peace talks between leaders of the two
countries.
	   Pakistani officials rarely announce military causalities. Malik
did not mention the soldiers' toll during a news conference
Saturday at which he updated the civilian death toll to 43 dead and
75 wounded. He reported the 37 soldiers to The Associated Press
only later.
	   India has said its death toll from the artillery duel was 23,
including 16 civilians killed when Pakistani mortar shells slammed
into a military hospital in the town of Tangdhar, some 200 meters
(yards) from the mountainous frontier and about 150 kilometers (90
miles) northwest of Srinagar, the capital of the Indian-held part
of Kashmir. The latest victim was a soldier killed Saturday, the
Press Trust of India reported.
	   Shell fire was tapering off Saturday after three days of heavy
fighting, Malik said. He said India started the deadly exchange to
try to undermine talks between its Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee and his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif. The two
leaders met in Sri Lanka on Wednesday and Thursday.
	   Top foreign office aides to Sharif and Vajpayee also met, but
they announced Friday that efforts to normalize Indo-Pakistani
relations had broken down because Pakistan insisted that Kashmir be
at the center of the talks while India insisted on first addressing
less contentious issues such as trade.
	   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir since both
nations became independent nearly 51 years ago. The territory is
divided between them by a 400-kilometer (250-mile) line of control
that is monitored by the United Nations.
	   Exchanges of mortar and gun fire is almost a daily occurrence,
but casualties of the magnitude of the past week are rare.
	   Malik told reporters Saturday that Pakistan would never
intensify fighting in Kashmir because it wanted a peaceful
settlement of the dispute.
	   ``The people who don't want it settled, they escalate,'' he
said.

Ireland frees first `early release' IRA prisoners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ The Irish Republic has freed the first
six IRA prisoners under the controversial early release provisions
of the Northern Ireland peace settlement.
	   In the province, pro-British hardline politicians who are deeply
opposed to the releases expressed outrage Saturday.
	   The six Irish Republican Army prisoners left high-security
Portlaoise Prison 50 miles (80 km), southwest of Dublin late Friday
night after Irish Justice Minister John O'Donoghue authorized the
release on the recommendation of a government commission.
	   Northern Ireland is to release several hundred pro-British
Loyalists and anti-British republicans from prison there in the
next two years under the April 10 Belfast agreement.
	   The accelerated release of paramilitaries was agreed after
multiparty talks on the province's future that resulted in creation
of a power-sharing Assembly.
	   The most senior of the six who walked out of Portlaoise on
Friday was Michael O'Brien, 38, the IRA's commanding officer at the
jail.
	   O'Brian, sentenced to 18 years in 1992 for attempted murder and
arms possession, had been allowed parole earlier this year to
attend the annual conference of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party,
which participated in the Belfast agreement.
	   The others set free were Adrian Donnelly, 58, serving five life
sentences in 1977 for bombing a London underground train, murder
and attempted murder; Vincent Wood, 34, jailed for 17 years in 1993
for possessing explosives; Michael Cully, 47, sentenced in February
to nine years in connection with a bomb factory; Frank Burke, 44,
sentenced for membership in the outlawed IRA and due for release in
2001, and Simon Maxwell, 32, jailed in October for six years for
explosives possession.
	   In Northern Ireland, Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the
Democratic Unionist Party said the releases were ``obscene.''
	   ``As they get out of jail, the IRA will get into government.
It's all part of the capitulation to the terrorists,'' Robinson
said.
	   His party, led by the Rev. Ian Paisley, refuses to deal with
Sinn Fein and was not among the eight parties that struck the
Belfast agreement.

Prior to East Timor talks, Indonesian minister again rules out
</HEADLINE>
referendum
 &UR; By IRWAN FIRDAUS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - Ahead of talks on East Timor at U.N.
headquarters in New York, Indonesia's foreign minister on Saturday
again ruled out a vote on independence in the conflict-ridden
territory.
	   Indonesia's reform-minded government has instead proposed
autonomy for the former Portuguese colony, saying East Timor must
remain part of the nation of 200 million. Indonesia invaded the
territory in 1975 and a small band of separatist rebels remains
active.
	   After a brief meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen,
Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas told reporters that autonomy
was the best hope for peace in East Timor.
	   ``It is the best solution, rather than a referendum that could
create old conflicts and trigger a civil war there,'' said Alatas,
who planned to leave Sunday for New York.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan is sponsoring talks on Aug.
4-5 involving Alatas and his Portuguese counterpart, Jaime Gama.
	   Portugal and East Timorese activists, including jailed rebel
leader Xanana Gusmao, have said East Timor's 800,000 people should
be allowed to determine their political future.
	   Indonesia has announced the withdrawal of 1,000 troops from East
Timor in an effort to promote dialogue. Eleven thousand soldiers
remain.
	   Many East Timorese resent the Indonesian military, which has
been accused of widespread abuses there. Tens of thousands of
people died in fighting and of famine and disease in the years
following the invasion.
	   Cohen, visiting Jakarta to express U.S. support for Indonesia's
democratic reform and efforts to rebuild its shattered economy,
said he was pleased about the move toward negotiations on East
Timor.
	   ``I think the recent activities pertaining to East Timor are
very encouraging,'' Cohen said at a news conference.

Tsunami ranks as one of worst disasters: Australian defense
</HEADLINE>
official

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ The Papua New Guinean tsunami ranked
as one of the worst civilian catastrophes Australian Defense Force
personnel had encountered, a senior relief task force officer said
Saturday.
	   ``Disaster is not a strong enough word,'' Maj. Doug Wren, second
in command of the tsunami relief effort for the Australian defense
forces, said after arriving in Towsnville, north Queensland, from
Vanimo in Papua New Guinea's West Sepik province.
	   On July 17, 7-meter (23-foot) waves smashed dozens of makeshift
villages along a stretch of northwestern Papua New Guinea. The
death toll in the disaster is estimated to be about 2,100.
	   ``It was just a moonscape when we flew over the scene in a
helicopter the day after the disaster,'' Wren said. ``To see entire
villages pushed back from the beach into the forest or the lagoon
was just heart-breaking.''

Musveni succeeds in getting approval for cabinet list
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ After meeting with skeptical legislators
at his official residence, President Yoweri Museveni managed to
convince them to drop objections to a proposed cabinet reshuffle, a
newspaper said Saturday.
	   Exercising its legal prerogative, a parliamentary committee on
Thursday rejected the list of 16 people _ including Museveni's only
brother _ proposed to fill two unidentified cabinet posts and 14
lower positions on the grounds the cabinet was already too big and
those named were unrepresentative.
	   It was the first time since 1966 that parliament had rejected a
president's list of cabinet changes.
	   ``I will be very glad if you approve the appointment of all the
people I nominated,'' the government-owned New Vision quoted
Museveni as telling committee members who were summoned to his
Nakasero residence Friday evening.
	   Maj. Gen. Salim Saleh, the president's brother who now occupies
a vague position called ``overseer'' of the Defense Ministry, was
one of two people named to take unspecified cabinet jobs.
	   The New Vision said the 16 nominees have now been approved and
will be sworn in on Friday.

Indian leader puts a positive spin on failed talks with Pakistan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with higher death count from Kashmir fighting. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's prime minister has put a
positive spin on failed talks with his Pakistani counterpart,
noting that at least the two belligerent neighbors are
communicating.
	   ``My meeting with Pakistan's prime minister has started the
process of resumption of dialogue,'' said Atal Bihari Vajpayee,
returning home Friday from a regional summit in Sri Lanka where he
met privately with Nawaz Sharif. He said India was ``committed to
the path of discourse and discussion.''
	   Vajpayee and Sharif met for the first time since the two
countries conducted nuclear tests in May, a step that significantly
raised the stakes in the 50-year history of Indo-Pakistani
antagonism.
	   The summit coincided with some of the heaviest cross-border
artillery duels in several years between the Indian and Pakistani
armies in Kashmir, which was the battlefield of full-scale wars in
1947 and 1965.
	   More than 100 people were reported killed and more than 100
wounded on both sides in four days of shelling this week. Dozens of
villages were virtually abandoned along the 250-mile frontier,
known as the Line of Control.
	   In Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, Majeed Malik, the minister
in charge of policy on Kashmir, said Friday that 37 soldiers and 43
civilians were killed. Another 75 people were wounded, he said
during a press conference.
	   Officials said the two leaders are likely to meet again in South
Africa in September when they attend a meeting of nonaligned
countries.
	   Three days of efforts by senior diplomats in the Sri Lankan
capital, Colombo, failed to overcome a wrangle over negotiating
their competing claims to the Himalayan territory of Kashmir.
Pakistan wants them to devote full attention to Kashmir, believing
it to be the key point of contention, while India says Kashmir
should be discussed alongside other differences.
	   It was the same quarrel that aborted negotiations last
September. That breakdown halted formal contacts that had been
revived earlier that year after a three-year hiatus.
	   Vajpayee took a more positive view of the encounter in Sri Lanka
than Sharif, who said it produced ``zero.''
	   The Colombo summit ended in mutual recriminations, with an
Indian spokesman accusing Pakistan of being ``obsessive'' and
``neurotic'' about Kashmir, and Pakistan charging that India was
``rigid and inflexible.''

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China celebrated Army Day with praise Saturday
for the millions of soldiers working to rescue victims of
disastrous flooding and prevent further damage.
	   China's 2.5 million-troop People's Liberation Army, the world's
largest, marked the 71st anniversary of its Aug. 1, 1927 founding
with pledges to further modernize at a ceremony held Friday evening
for the top brass.
	   The military faces increasing financial pressure following an
order by President Jiang Zemin, who is chairman of the Central
Military Commission, to divest its vast business interests and to
crack down on army-sponsored smuggling.
	   A front-page editorial in the Communist Party newspaper People's
Daily lauded the army's ``heroic deeds,'' but also warned military
officers against decadence.
	   ``Officers in the People's Army should take a lead in fighting
against money worshiping, hedonism and out-and-out egoism and other
evil tendencies,'' it said.
	   While moving to restrain corruption within the military, the
ruling Communist Party is making ample use of the army's efforts in
flood rescue and relief to demonstrate its concern for the millions
of China affected by severe flooding this summer that has killed at
least 1,261 people.
	   State-run television and newspapers run daily reports on life
vest-clad troops struggling in chest-deep waters to shore up
sagging levees with large rocks and sandbags.
	   Almost 4 million soldiers, armed police and other units are
working to fight floods along the Yangtze River and in other
disaster areas. They have been credited with rescuing more than
300,000 flood victims and are aiding in reconstruction efforts, the
Xinhua News Agency reported.

Somali attackers kill Ngorongoro district police commander
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ Somali cattle raiders disguised
as Maasai warriors killed a district police commander and captured
or killed five policemen in a shootout near Loliondo, 16 kilometers
(10 miles) from the Kenyan border, reports said Saturday.
	   The government-owned Daily News and the independent African said
Ngorongoro district commander Venance Kong'oa was killed Friday
night during a raid mounted by the Somalis to steal cattle and
other property.
	   Quoted in the African, Loliondo district commissioner Enos Mfuru
said the raiders, armed with AK-type assault rifles and
government-issue firearms, overpowered the policemen and took them
prisoner, then shot Kong'oa in the back and in both legs.
	   The news reports quoted residents in the area, which is north of
the Ngorongoro Conservation Area and is inhabited by nomadic
Maasai, saying the Somalis, who had been in the area for some time
and had crossed over from Kenya, had disguised themselves as Maasai
with the characteristic red cloth cloaks known as ``shuga.''
	   Other reports said the police commander from the regional
capital in Arusha, 200 kilometers (125 miles) east of Loliondo, had
flown to the site with about 50 policemen to pursue the raiders.
	   President Banjamin Mkapa recently visited the Loliondo area _
which lies between major game reserves and tourists sites in Kenya
and Tanzania _ and promised residents a massive operation would be
launched to capture the raiders who were terrorizing villages.
	   Mkapa was quoted as saying the operation would also involve
Kenya to end the harrassment.

Islamic militants assault newspaper editor, beat AP reporters
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with editor assaulted, threatened
with death

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Islamic militants protesting outside a
pro-democracy newspaper Saturday assaulted its editor and
threatened him with death, witnesses and staff members said.
	   The protesters also beat two Associated Press reporters who went
to the scene later.
	   Tous editor Mahmoud Shams said about 30 unidentified youths
demonstrating on the street confronted him outside the building as
he arrived for work, and someone punched him in the face. Witnesses
and staff members confirmed the account.
	   Fearing more trouble, Shams' colleagues whisked him away in a
car. He returned after the protesters left voluntarily.
	   The popular Tous newspaper, known for its outspoken views on
Iranian politics, resumed publishing last week after skirting a ban
by the hard-line ruling clergy, which controls radical Islamic
groups.
	   Shams told reporters that his attackers ``told me ... `we are
here to kill you.'''
	   AP reporters Anwar Faruqi and Afshin Valinejad, who went to the
Tous office after hearing about the trouble, were stopped by the
protesters and told to leave.
	   Faruqi said that when he asked why, about a dozen men started
pushing the two AP reporters.
	   Faruqi, an AP correspondent based in Dubai, fell to the ground
and about five attackers punched and kicked him. His shirt was
ripped and his hands and legs bled.
	   They ``started kicking me and punching me and kicked me on my
neck, my stomach and legs,'' Faruqi said.
	   Valinejad, the AP's Tehran reporter, was kicked in the groin.
	   Faruqi said the attack lasted between five and seven minutes.
Faruqi said a few policemen standing nearby intervened, pulling
away the attackers and giving the AP reporters a chance to escape.
	   There were no other reporters on the scene at the time.
	   Faruqi, a Pakistani citizen, and Valinejad, an Iranian, were
shaken but did not need hospitalization.
	   Later, the protesters told other reporters that they had not
beaten any journalists. They also said they were not affiliated
with any group. Militant groups associated with the hard-line
clergy have broken up pro-democracy demonstrations and attacked
newspapers in the past.
	   Tous is the latest target in the power struggle between moderate
President Mohammad Khatami, who favors a freer press, and
conservative clergymen who want to maintain strict control over
information.
	   Tous used to publish under the name Jameah until Jameah's
license was revoked last month for printing what authorities said
were ``insults and lies.''
	   However, it started publishing last Saturday under the name of
Tous, a provincial newspaper, while retaining the staff and the
facilities of Jameah.
	   Newspaper licenses are issued by the Ministry of Culture and
Islamic Guidance, headed by a Khatami loyalist, but the power to
revoke licenses rests with the Justice Department, which is
dominated by ultra-conservatives.

Russian premier holds semi-secret talks with Chechen leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with meeting underway outside Nazran, no
progress reported. &QL; 
 &UR; By MAURA REYNOLDS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ In an effort to shore up the regime of Russia's
erstwhile enemy, Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko held semi-secret
talks Saturday with Chechen president Aslan Maskhadov.
	   Maskhadov _ who led Chechnya's war for independence and was
elected president 18 months ago _ has been shaken by a new wave of
violence in and around the republic that included an assassination
attempt.
	   President Boris Yeltsin ordered Kiriyenko to hold the meeting in
part to express Moscow's support for Maskhadov, even though he
remains a firm advocate of Chechen independence.
	   However, Russia considers Maskhadov a moderate who is trying to
rein in Chechnya's diverse and well-armed bands of fighters, and
fears that if he were to fall a more radical leader could come to
power.
	   Because of security concerns, the location of the meeting _ at a
government residence 30 kilometers (20 miles) outside Nazran, the
capital of the Caucasus republic of Ingushetia _ was announced by
Russian news agencies only after it was underway.
	   The two leaders spoke for several hours without reports of
progress or agreements, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The talks are Maskhadov's first high-level negotiations with a
Russian leader since he held a summit with President Boris Yeltsin
in Moscow last August.
	   In an interview with Interfax earlier Saturday, Maskhadov said
he would tell Kiriyenko, who became premier in April, that Russia
has failed to meet its obligations to Chechnya under a peace treaty
signed in May 1997.
	   ``The Chechen people are tired of Russia's many promises, which
have remained just that _ promises,'' Maskhadov said.
	   The cease-fire that ended the 1994-1996 Chechen war and the
subsequent treaty did not resolve the vital question of Chechnya's
political status. Chechnya runs its own affairs and considers
itself independent, but Moscow and the rest of the world treats it
as part of Russia.
	   Chechen officials long have accused the Kremlin of failing to
fulfill its promises to rebuild the republic's war-battered
economy.
	   For their part, Russian officials consider Chechnya a prime
source of the violence and crime that plague the Caucasus region.
	   ``The best method of fighting crime is to revive Chechnya's
economy and social sphere, which will cut off the roots of crime,''
Maskhadov told Interfax.
	   The Chechen president declared a month-long state of emergency
in June after a group of gunmen tried to seize the republic's
television center. Conflicts between various armed gangs, sects and
ethnic groups have flared in recent weeks into open clashes.
	   On July 23, Maskhadov narrowly escaped assassination in a car
bombing that killed two of his bodyguards. He first blamed Russian
secret services for the attack, then suggested rival Chechen
leaders could also be involved.
	   Russian military and police troops on Friday completed four days
of military exercises in the region intended to help quell the
increasing violence.

Illegal immigrants occupy Vatican mission
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ More than a dozen illegal immigrants on Saturday
occupied the Vatican mission in France, seeking a direct line to
Pope John Paul II to press their demands for papers for 17
comrades.
	   Police surrounded the building in Paris' chic 16th district.
Police officials said a group of about 15 illegal immigrants,
mainly Africans, were inside the building, speaking with the
Vatican representative to France, Mario Tagliaferri.
	   ``We are asking the (Vatican) ambassador to transmit our demands
to Pope John Paul II, and we're waiting for a message from him
supporting our fight for dignity, justice and equality,'' said a
statement issued by the group.
	   There was no immediate comment from the mission.
	   The group goes by the name of the ``Paperless of Saint
Bernard,'' after a Paris church which once served as a sanctuary
for illegal immigrants trying to avoid expulsion.
	   The occupiers entered the building at 10:30 a.m. Saturday to
press the French government for papers for 17 members of the group.
	   The statement noted the 29-month effort to regularize all those
who once occupied the church, eventually stormed by police.
	   It said that the immigrants were now being slowly expelled from
a new refuge, apparently run by a union that has turned off
electricity and water.

Lawmaker convicted of forging stock document
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) - A legislator was convicted Saturday by the High
Court on a charge of forging a stock transfer document in 1992.
	   Chim Pui-chung became the first lawmaker convicted since Hong
Kong's return to Chinese rule last year.
	   The nine-member jury ruled by a 7-2 vote after a seven-month
trial that Chim was guilty of falsifying a stock transfer document
related to the sale of shares in his company Lucky Man Properties.
	   He was found innocent on five other charges of fraud and
bribery.
	   He was accused of conspiring to defraud the Securities and
Futures Commission and minority shareholders of his Mandarin
Resources Corp. and Lucky Man Properties in a 350 million Hong Kong
dollar (dlrs 44.8 million) property deal.
	   Chim, who pleaded innocent, will be sentenced next week.
	   If jailed, Chim could lose his seat in the legislature. The
independent lawmaker told reporters on Friday that he planned to
appeal if convicted.

More radioactive contamination at Georgian military bases
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Experts have located and are cleaning up
radioactive contamination at a former Soviet military base that is
10 times above safe levels, officials said Saturday.
	   The source of the radiation at the base near the village of
Markhodzhi had not yet been determined, Environment Minister Nino
Chkhobadze told a news conference.
	   He said the contamination covers an area about 600 meters
(yards) across and measures 230 roentgens per hour. Twenty
roentgens per hour is considered safe.
	   With the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, Russian troops abandoned
about 300 military facilities in Georgia, leaving chemical and
nuclear contamination behind.
	   Georgia has begun using many of those bases for its own troops
even though experts have been able to check only about 20 percent
of them for danger.
	   Last year 11 Georgian troops were badly burned when they
discovered metallic capsules on their base in the town of Lilo. The
capsules contained cesium-137, and radioactive contamination on the
base reached 13,000 roentgens per hour.

Iraq says American expert took `spy' pictures of train
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's official media on Saturday accused
an American weapons inspector for the U.N. of taking pictures of a
train carrying military equipment, describing the act as espionage.
	   Jason Gilbert's Iraqi escorts spotted him taking pictures of a
passing train on Tuesday and asked him to destroy the film ``as
they considered it ... spying,'' the army's al-Qadissiya newspaper
said.
	   Gilbert destroyed the film, al-Qadissiya said, adding that the
train had ``nothing to do with his work.'' Other newspapers carried
similar reports.
	   Gilbert is one of the many experts working for the United
Nations Special Commission, which is overseeing the destruction of
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Gilbert usually leads U.N.
divers during underwater searches of rivers and lakes.
	   The UNSCOM in Baghdad refused to comment immediately on the
allegation.
	   Al-Qadissiya and al-Iraq newspapers said the National Monitoring
Commission, the department that liaises between UNSCOM and the
Iraqi government, strongly condemned the act.
	   The Monitoring Commission has asked UNSCOM to ``put a stop to
such acts,'' the newspapers said.
	   Iraq has often accused UNSCOM inspectors, especially Americans
among them, of spying. The UNSCOM denies the charge. But since the
beginning of the monitoring program in 1991, the two sides have
often become locked in serious confrontations.
	   Until the inspectors certify that Iraq is rid of illegal
weapons, the United Nations will not lift economic sanctions
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   UNSCOM chairman Richard Butler has said that Iraq still needs to
provide more data on its biological and chemical weapons program.
The nuclear program also remains an issue.
	   Butler is scheduled to arrive in Iraq Sunday ``to discuss
outstanding issues'' with Iraqi leaders, UNSCOM spokeswoman Janet
Sullivan said. She did not elaborate.
	   Butler is expected to be accompanied by 19 specialists,
including Nikita Smidovich, chief U.N. missile investigator, Horst
Reeps, chief U.N. chemical weapons investigator and Cabreile
Kraatz-Wadfack, chief germ warfare investigator.
	   Also Monday, Iraq's Parliament will hold an extraordinary
session to review Iraq's relations with UNSCOM.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with additional comments from Mahathir in the last

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ It was business as usual Saturday for
passengers traveling between Singapore and Malaysia, even though no
last minute agreement had been reached between the squabbling
neighbors over the location of Malaysia's customs and immigration
post.
	   Beginning August 1, Singapore moved its railway customs post
from Tanjong Pagar in downtown Singapore to Woodlands, the
checkpoint across the water from the Malaysian city of Johor Bahru.
	   Malaysia has refused to relocate its customs post from Tanjong
Pagar. Singapore proclaimed that checkpoint illegal, saying it
would allow people to obtain permission to enter Malaysia before
gaining clearance to exit Singapore.
	   Earlier this week Singapore said that all immigration stamps
made by Malaysian officers at Tanjong Pagar station on Singapore
and other passports will be ``unauthorized and improper.'' It also
warned foreign passengers with such unauthorized travel permits on
their passports that they may face difficulties at Singapore
immigration checkpoints.
	   As the Aug. 1 deadline approached, the lack of agreement left in
limbo hundreds of thousands of daily passengers, mostly Malaysians
traveling to work in Singapore.
	   In what appeared a temporary face-saving solution, Malaysian
immigration officers showed up at Tanjong Pagar station but did not
stamp the passports of the hundreds of people boarding the 8:15
a.m. (12:15 GMT) train.
	   The train then stopped at the Woodlands station to be cleared by
the Singapore custom and immigration officers.
	   International press was denied access by the Singapore police to
the platform, as well as to the subsequent news briefing in the
station. No explanation was given.
	   There appeared to be no Malaysian immigration officers at the
Woodlands railway platform.
	   The train then left Singapore and proceeded to Johor Bahru, the
first stop in Malaysia. Singapore TV reported that no immigration
facilities were set up at the station, and that passengers left
without being cleared for entry.
	   Earlier in the day, an overnight train from Kuala Lumpur, the
Malaysian capital, arrived in Singapore and was cleared for entry
at Woodlands after passing through Malaysian emigration at Johor
Bahru.
	   The latest dispute has heightened tensions between the two
neighbors, which in 1963 were briefly united in a federation.
	   Though the experiment failed, the two countries still depend
closely on each other, with Malaysia providing most of Singapore's
water and hundreds of thousands of its workers, and Singapore
businesses investing heavily in Malaysian industry.
	   The news media in both countries have been used in propaganda
wars in a replay of past disputes over water, tourism, and other
issues.
	   In 1989, Singapore decided to abandon the joint checkpoint in
Tanjong Pagar and move it closer to the actual border, saying this
would facilitate checks on drug traffickers, smugglers and illegal
immigrants.
	   Malaysia said Saturday it will continue to check passengers at
Tanjong Pagar.
	   ``As far as we are concerned, we will function as usual,'' Prime
Minister Mohamad Mahathir told reporters.
	   Mahathir blamed Singapore for the dispute, saying, ``If there is
a souring of relations between Malaysia and Singapore, it is
because of them.''
	   ``I don't know why they choose this time to do this thing. Maybe
to them it is a strategy,'' said Mahathir.
	   Asked if he thought Malaysia and Singapore could settle the
dispute by themselves, Mahathir said: ``We hope we can, we'll
try.''
	   Up to 27 trains run daily between the two countries for
passenger, freight and a golf shuttle service. The passenger
service also includes the famed Eastern and Oriental Express.

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ The Irish Republic has freed the first
six IRA prisoners under the controversial early release provisions
of the Northern Ireland peace settlement.
	   In the province, pro-British hardline politicians who are deeply
opposed to the releases expressed outrage Saturday.
	   The six Irish Republican Army prisoners left high-security
Portlaoise Prison 50 miles (80 km), southwest of Dublin late Friday
night after Irish Justice Minister John O'Donoghue authorized the
release on the recommendation of a government commission.
	   Northern Ireland is to release several hundred pro-British
Loyalists and anti-British republicans from prison there in the
next two years under the April 10 Belfast agreement.
	   The accelerated release of paramilitaries was agreed after
multiparty talks on the province's future that resulted in creation
of a power-sharing Assembly.
	   The most senior of the six who walked out of Portlaoise on
Friday was Michael O'Brien, 38, the IRA's commanding officer at the
jail.
	   O'Brien, sentenced to 18 years in 1992 for attempted murder and
arms possession, had been allowed parole earlier this year to
attend the annual conference of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party,
which participated in the Belfast agreement.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Landslides triggered by heavy rains killed
at least 28 people and injured 30 others in two Iranian provinces,
news reports said Saturday.
	   Twenty-six people were killed in Masouleh city in the northern
Gilan province, Iranian radio reported. Two people were killed in
the northeastern Ardebil province, the official Islamic Republic
News Agency said. The casualties occurred Friday.
	   Rescue workers were trying Saturday to pull out bodies buried
under mud in the city of Masouleh, the agency reported.
	   Witnesses and law enforcement officials fear more than 100
people may be buried but the figure has not been officially
confirmed, it said.
	   The floods also damaged a number of cars and homes along the
Masouleh river, the agency reported.
	   In Ardebil, floods killed livestock and caused damage to
orchards and farms in 20 villages, IRNA said. Relief workers have
rescued 700 stranded villagers.
	   A landslide in April killed 55 people in a remote village in
central Iran.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's biggest independent
poll-watching group said Saturday that voting procedures at more
than 90 percent of polling stations ``went smoothly and without
incident'' during the recent parliamentary election. The Committee
for Free and Fair Elections in Cambodia, COMFREL, said some serious
violations had been reported by its observers during last Sunday's
polls, but they believed that the cases represented scattered
incidents. At the same time, however, the group expressed serious
concern about post-election violence and intimidation directed
against members of opposition parties. The group issued its
evaluation as final official election results were still awaited.

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan suffered heavy military
casualties from a three-day bombardment in territory where it has
overlapping claims with India, a Pakistani Cabinet minister said
Saturday. Majeed Malik, the minister in charge of policy on
disputed Kashmir, said 37 soldiers were among a total of 80
Pakistanis killed in shelling by Indian troops that he said was
part of New Delhi's plan to derail peace talks between leaders of
the two countries. Pakistani officials rarely announce military
casualties. Malik did not mention the soldiers' toll during a news
conference Saturday at which he updated the civilian death toll to
43 dead and 75 wounded. He mentioned it to The Associated Press
later. India has said its death toll from the artillery duel was
23, including 16 civilians killed when Pakistani mortar shells
slammed into a military hospital. The latest victim was a soldier
killed Saturday, the Press Trust of India reported.
(PAKISTAN-KASHMIR)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ In an effort to shore up the regime of Russia's
erstwhile enemy, Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko held semi-secret
talks Saturday with Chechen president Aslan Maskhadov. Maskhadov,
who led Chechnya's war for independence and was elected president
18 months ago, has been shaken by a new wave of violence in and
around the republic that included an assassination attempt.
President Boris Yeltsin ordered Kiriyenko to hold the meeting in
part to express Moscow's support for Maskhadov, despite his firm
advocacy of Chechen independence. Russia considers Maskhadov a
moderate who is trying to rein in Chechnya's diverse and well-armed
bands of fighters, and fears that if he were to fall a more radical
leader could come to power. The two leaders spoke for several hours
without reports of progress or agreements, the Interfax news agency
reported. (RUSSIA-CHECHNYA)
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Union leaders Saturday questioned the
legality of President Robert Mugabe's use of an old colonial law to
block a threatened five-day national strike against alleged
government corruption and economic mismanagement. On Friday, Mugabe
declared all branches of the economy to be essential services,
except domestic service, farming and coal mining. Under the former
Rhodesia's 1960 Law and Order Maintenance Act, anyone inciting or
participating in a stoppage at an essential service faces a 10-year
jail sentence. The government also adopted tough new regulations to
control public meetings and demonstrations, and reserved the right
to issue further rules, a Government Gazette notice said.
Zimbabwe's Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that Mugabe's use of
such regulations to suppress dissent violates democratic rights
anchored in the 1980 constitution. No strike date has been set.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ While experts tried to determine if the
water in Australia's largest city was safe to drink again, lawyers
tapped into public anger Saturday with newspaper advertisements
recruiting clients to sue the local water agency. Authorities have
admitted failing to issue immediate warnings to consumers after the
dangerous parasites giardia and cryptosporidium were found in
Sydney's water system Wednesday and Thursday. New South Wales State
Urban Affairs and Planning Minister Craig Knowles said Saturday the
latest water tests were encouraging and people in some parts of the
city may be able to drink their tap water again by Sunday. Until
then, the city's 3.7 million inhabitants have been advised to boil
water for drinking and cooking; retailers have reported a
300-percent jump in sales of bottled water. (AUSTRALIA-WATER SCARE)

Mugabe bans strikes to head off trade union protest

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Union leaders Saturday questioned the
legality of President Robert Mugabe's use of an old colonial law to
block a five-day national strike called to protest alleged
government corruption and economic mismanagement.
	   Mugabe on Friday declared all branches of the economy to be
essential services, except domestic service, farming and coal
mining.
	   Under the former Rhodesia's 1960 Law and Order Maintenance Act,
anyone inciting or participating in a stoppage at an essential
service faces a 10-year jail sentence.
	   The government also adopted tough new regulations to control
public meetings and demonstrations, and reserved the right to issue
further rules, a Government Gazette notice said.
	   Zimbabwe's Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that Mugabe's use
of such regulations to suppress dissent violates democratic rights
anchored in the 1980 constitution.
	   Mugabe faces the most serious challenge to his leadership since
independence in 1980. Earlier this year, eight people died in
country-wide food riots over price increases before Mugabe called
out troops and tanks to quell the unrest.
	   A national trades union strike in March shut down the country
for two days. A 37 percent hike in electricity rates announced
Thursday adds new strain to an economy pressured by inflation of
more than 30 percent, high unemployment and a falling Zimbabwe
dollar.
	   And Zimbabwe's farming sector slumped after Mugabe's declaration
that the government will seize 1,500 commercial farms owned mostly
by whites and redistribute the land to landless blacks.
	   Farmers were recently forced by violent strikes to increase farm
worker pay by 32 percent. Winter wheat farmers planted 20 percent
less than last year, media reports said this week.
	   Trade unionists meeting in the eastern border town of Mutare
last week agreed to seek a final meeting with Mugabe before
launching a strike action. No strike date was set.
	   On Thursday, Mugabe warned leaders of the Zimbabwe Congress of
Trades Unions ``not to seek a confrontation'' over their demands
for revocation of a 15 percent tax on pension funds and a 5 percent
surcharge on income tax.
	   Through a complex system of tax-free allowances, ruling party
politicians are largely exempt from paying taxes.

Investigators question Ms. Bhutto's husband in jail
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistani investigators went to a Lahore
prison Saturday to question former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's
husband about bank accounts reportedly seized by French
authorities, officials said.
	   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Asif
Zardari was interrogated for 90 minutes by a three-member team
headed by a judge. The sources said the team questioned Zardari at
the request of Swiss authorities who have indicted him on charges
of money laundering.
	   Zardari was arrested soon after former president Farooq Leghari
dismissed Ms. Bhutto's government in November 1996. He is held on a
number of corruption and other charges, including the slaying of
his wife's estranged younger brother Murtaza.
	   The Swiss court that indicted Zardari last month had said it was
clearing up details before charging Ms. Bhutto as well. Like her
husband, Ms. Bhutto faces several corruption cases in Pakistan.
	   Ms. Bhutto's government was dismissed in 1996 after being
accused of ineptitude and widespread corruption.

	   TAKHMAU, Cambodia (AP) _ A former Khmer Rouge guerrilla
suspected of being responsible for the killings of three young
Western tourists in 1994 has been arrested after being lured to
Cambodia's capital by police.
	   The country's top leader, Hun Sen, announced details of the
arrest of Nuon Paet on Saturday after giving a briefing on the
matter to the ambassadors of Australia, Britain and France, the
homelands of the victims.
	   Nuon Paet headed a band of Khmer Rouge guerrillas who halted a
train going south from the capital in 1994 and abducted three young
Western backpackers: David Wilson, 29, of Australia, Mark Slater,
28, of Britain and Jean-Michel Braquet, 27, of France.
	   The guerrillas, holed up on rugged Vine Mountain in the southern
province of Kampot, held three months of protracted negotiations
with the government during which they asked a ransom for their
release.
	   The negotiations apparently continued even after the men had
been executed, unbeknownst to the government.
	   At least 10 foreigners were taken hostage and subsequently
killed by Khmer Rouge guerrillas in 1994 or after. Only one,
American Melissa Himes, escaped unharmed.
	   ``This is a success for our national police,'' Hun Sen told
reporters at his residence just outside the capital. He said he
asked the ambassadors to send lawyers to the planned trial on
behalf of the victims.
	   Hun Sen's account of Nuon Paet's arrest indicated that the
authorities had lured the former guerrilla to the capital on the
pretense of a business deal. He said police had been working on the
case for a long time.
	   Hun Sen said Nuon Paet had most recently been in the western
province Pailin on the Thai border, a former guerrilla stronghold
which is now ruled semi-autonomously by high-ranking Khmer Rouge
defectors who came over to the government in 1996.
	   He said Nuon Paet was known to disguise himself in an army
uniform or as a trader, and was active in smuggling cars from
Thailand.
	   His account said that Nuon Paet and five bodyguards were stopped
in their car as they were driving from Phnom Penh's airport to the
capital city.
	   Dressed casually in light colored sport shirt, Nuon Paet looked
unhappy as was taken at first to a police station, hands cuffed
behind his back and escorted by plainclothes police.
	   He was later escorted by heavily armed uniformed police to the
capital's notorious T-3 prison, where political offenders and other
important prisoners are usually held.
	   The case had caused considerable controversy, especially in
Australia, because it was believed that the Cambodian government
had mishandled the negotiations. A parliamentary hearing was held
in Canberra and a special coroner's inquest in Melbourne to
investigate why the men could not be saved.
	   The Cambodian government was sharply criticized at the time of
the incident for first agreeing to pay a hefty ransom to the
captors and then shelling their base in order to try to spur
defections among Nuon Paet's men.
	   There has also been criticism that the government had been aware
of Nuon Paet's whereabouts for at least the past year but was
unwilling to apprehend him.
	   Tony Kevin _ who became Australia's ambassador to Cambodia just
three days before the hostages were taken and left the post last
September _ said ``the important thing now is that he has been
arrested, and provided that's followed by a proper criminal
investigation and judicial process, I think that's the most
important thing to focus on.''
	   ``This isn't going to bring the hostages back, of course, the
tragedy is that they are dead, but if the families can have a full
understanding of the facts and what happened, I think that's a good
thing,'' he told The Associated Press in Phnom Penh, where he
served as an observer for Cambodia's recent parliamentary election.
	   ``The sooner the trial takes place the better,'' said Hun Sen,
who appeared relaxed and happy, adding that the ambassadors
expressed ``satisfaction'' at news of the arrest.
	   Hun Sen said that the trial should take place in Phnom Penh for
security reasons.
	   The Khmer Rouge seized power in 1975 and killed as many as 2
million Cambodians in a bid to create a communist agrarian utopia.
It battled successive central governments after it was overthrown
in 1979 by a Vietnamese invasion.
	   In 1996, a huge wave of defections by the guerrillas, initiated
by their former foreign minister Ieng Sary, crippled the
revolutionary movement and gave the country its best chance for
peace in decades. Only a few remnants remain after the government
took over their last major stronghold this past April.

Palestinian official: Talks to end if no pullout agreement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Just-resumed direct talks between
Israel and the Palestinians will end in the next few days unless
Israel accepts a U.S. initiative and agrees to withdraw from 13
percent of the West Bank, a top Palestinian official said Saturday.
	   Nabil Shaath, speaking to reporters in the Gaza Strip, said the
talks would end in ``two, three or four days ... unless the
Israelis come up with a miracle and declare their acceptance of the
American initiative and are ready to withdraw.
	   ``Until now, we have nothing to indicate that Israel is ready to
accept the American initiative,'' Shaath said upon returning to
Gaza from a six-day trip to Austria, Morocco and Turkey with
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat.
	   Arafat said Saturday that despite the talks over the past two
weeks, ``Everything is still frozen.''
	   Asked what the next step would be he said only, ``We have to
wait and see.''
	   Shaath said the Palestinians had agreed to the meetings with
Israeli negotiators at the request of U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright.
	   ``We knew that the chances were slim but we sat and listened to
not give an excuse,'' he said. ``We tried and listened attentively
and received nothing from Israel. So the responsibility is in
Albright's hands.''
	   Shaath said he hoped the United States would put real pressure
on Israel ``to push things forward.''
	   Negotiations broke down 16 months ago. For the past two weeks,
the two sides have been holding direct talks to try to revive them
and work out conditions for a long-overdue Israeli withdrawal from
the West Bank.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has refused to accept an
American proposal for a 13 percent withdrawal, accompanied by
Palestinian moves to increase security. The Palestinians have
accepted the proposal.
	   After months of unsuccessful shuttle diplomacy, the United
States said it was time for the two sides to work out their
differences themselves.

Cambodian election authorities delay final tally
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES tally of preliminary official results released to
seven provinces &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBIN McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The body charged with overseeing
Cambodia's parliamentary elections released preliminary official
results for seven of 23 constituencies Saturday, but said that the
complete final tally had been delayed as officials worked to verify
the count.
	   A spokesman for the National Election Committee said that
numbers were being sent in by fax and by radio and then keyed into
computers and re-checked with officials from communal and
provincial counting stations.
	   ``We will begin to announce our findings as they come in from
today until the results are complete,'' said Samraing Kimsan at a
daily briefing.
	   The Cambodian People's Party of strongman Hun Sen topped the
polls in six of the seven constituencies.
	   Cambodia's biggest independent poll-watching group said Saturday
that voting procedures at more than 90 percent of the country's
polling stations ``went smoothly and without incident'' during the
country's recent parliamentary election.
	   The Committee for Free and Fair Elections in Cambodia _ COMFREL
_ said some serious violations had been reported by its observers
during last Sunday's polls, but they believed that the cases
represented scattered incidents.
	   At the same time, however, the group expressed serious concern
about post-election violence and intimidation directed against
members of opposition parties.
	   A projection by COMFREL of the final tally gives the ruling
Cambodian People's Party 64 seats in the 122-seat National
Assembly, the leading opposition group FUNCINPEC 43 seats, and its
ally the Sam Rainsy Party 15 seats.
	   The ruling party's projected parliamentary margin increased
Friday after it became known that a new, little-known formula
favoring the party getting the most votes would be used to
determine the allocation of the winners' parliamentary seats.
	   Opposition parties on Friday repeated their allegations of
cheating by the ruling party in the polls.
	   The FUNCINPEC party of Prince Norodom Ranariddh and the Sam
Rainsy Party issued a joint statement saying they would accept the
election's results ``when and if the serious irregularities
reported'' were shown not to have altered its outcome
	   Scores of opposition party activists from rural areas have taken
shelter in the FUNCINPEC and Sam Rainsy Party headquarters in Phnom
Penh after being threatened by police and local authorities loyal
to the Cambodian People's Party.
	   COMFREL head Thun Saray called on the government's National
Election Committee to see that such charges of intimidation were
pursued by the authorities, as well as to investigate complaints of
serious violations in the voting and vote-counting processes.
	   The two main opposition parties on Friday called on Hun Sen's
ruling party to immediately end ``the campaign of intimidation it
has mounted against our activists in villages and communes across
Cambodia.''
	   Opposition parties on Tuesday had already asked that new votes
be taken in disputed precincts if their charges of wrongdoing were
found to be valid.
	   They threatened to boycott the National Assembly if their
complaints were not heeded.
	   Without the opposition's attendance, the assembly is unlikely to
have present the two-thirds of its 122 members needed to conduct
any business.
	   Hun Sen responded by inviting them to join a coalition
government, warning that if they carried out their threat not to
attend the National Assembly, he could lower the constitutional
minimum for the assembly to meet and confirm a government from
two-thirds to 50 percent plus one. He also said his current
government could remain in power.
	   Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh as his co-premier in a violent coup a
year ago, dismantling much of his political machine in the process.
	   Their co-premiership emerged from U.N.-sponsored elections in
1993 which were meant to usher in a new era of peace and democracy.
	   Ranariddh won, but Hun Sen, who came to power in 1985 under the
harsh Vietnamese occupation that followed the Khmer Rouge, forced
his way into a coalition by threatening war.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The summer vacation season in Italy got off to a
clutch-grinding start Saturday with thousands of cars jamming the
highways.
	   Famous foreigners, another fixture of the Italian summer, also
began to arrive. The first was British Prime Minister Tony Blair,
who vacations in the Tuscany wine country, a spot so popular with
his countrymen its nickname is ``Chiantishire.''
	   Italian Premier Romano Prodi rolled out the red carpet for Blair
and his family when they arrived at the Bologna airport Saturday.
The Blairs will spend two weeks in a villa outside the medieval
Tuscan hill town of San Gimignano.
	   Ordinary folks were also headed for the hills _ and the beaches
_ for a summer break. State television showed columns of cars up to
10 kms (6 miles) long on highways from the Brenner Pass in the Alps
to the beaches of the Italian ``boot.''

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Police searched the fog-shrouded hills of Russia's
Chukotka Peninsula on Saturday for three inmates still at large
after a prison break, news agencies reported.
	   The Chukotka peninsula, which extends into the Bering Strait, is
the point of land closest to the U.S. state of Alaska.
	   A total of 11 convicts killed a police officer and stole a large
number of weapons before escaping from the prison Friday and
fleeing in two stolen trucks and an armored vehicle.
	   Two of the convicts and two more police were killed in a
shootout as officers tried to corral the fugitives with armored
vehicles and helicopters, the Interfax news agency reported. A
third fugitive committed suicide.
	   Of the rest, five were captured and three remain at large, news
agencies reported.
	   Six of the 11 escapees were active-duty soldiers jailed on
murder charges. The other five were civilians convicted of rape and
robbery. It was not clear which of the convicts were still at
large.

Baganda use coronation anniversary to protest land act

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Dozens of men and women dressed in
traditional white and red mourning clothes Saturday observed the
fifth anniversary of the coronation of Buganda's king in a peaceful
protest over a controversial land act.
	   The mourners were saying prayers in churches and mosques over
the three-day period from Friday to Sunday that marks the fifth
anniversary on the traditional throne of King Ronald Muwenda
Mutebi, a London-educated lawyer.
	   The Baganda, the largest of Uganda's 28 ethnic groups, are
unhappy about the 1998 Land Act that failed to restore to the
kabaka, or king, 9,000 square miles of royal land confiscated by
the government when President Milton Obote abolished Uganda's four
traditional monarchies in 1966.
	   ``It will be a day of mourning for the Baganda. Without land for
the king, he is not a king because all land in Buganda belongs to
him,'' Kaaya Kavuma, deputy prime minister in the ``mengo'' or
royal household, said earlier in the week.
	   The government of President Yoweri Museveni warned against
turning the coronation anniversary into mourning and said the Land
Act benefitted both Baganda landlords and ordinary tenants.
	   The Buganda homeland lies in what is now central Uganda and
includes some of the East African nation's best agricultural land.
Traditionally, the land was apportioned out under a share-cropping
system, but the kabaka and his chiefs remained the owners.
	   As in many African countries, the question of land ownership in
Uganda remains a thorny issue. In traditional African societies,
land was held in common, often entrusted to a monarch or chief.
	   Colonial powers usurped the land and upset holding patterns.
Independent nations now find themselves with several land-holding
systems based on customary and European law.
	   Mutebi is the son of Kabaka Edward Mutesa, who became Uganda's
first president upon independence in 1962. Obote, a Langi from
northern Uganda, ousted him with the help of the army in 1966,
ushering in a 20-year period of civil war and devastation in which
an estimated 650,000 people died.

	   When Museveni launched his revolt against Obote in 1981, he
appealed to rural people for support, promising them the return of
their cherished monarchies.
	   He and his National Resistance Movement gained power in 1986 but
waited seven years to reinstate three of the four tribal monarchs _
of the Baganda, Batoro and Banyoro peoples. The fourth, the
Banyakole monarchy which ruled in Museveni's southwestern homeland,
was not restored and no official explanation was given.
	   But the reinstatement of the monarchies did not include
restoration of the considerable political powers previously
wielded, particularly by the Baganda elite.
	   Museveni, a cattle raiser with a wide-ranging interest in
agriculture, claims that making the Buganda land available on a
freehold basis to farmers will rationalize and increase
agricultural production.
	   The Baganda traditionalists fear that the formerly royal land
will fall into non-Baganda hands.

Angolan military denies forced recruitment as U.N envoy begins
</HEADLINE>
mission to avert civil war

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The Angolan armed forces on Saturday
denied U.N. allegations that they have begun a forced recruitment
drive in response to the country's apparent slide back into civil
war.
	   The denial, issued in a joint statement by the army and police,
came on the first day of an emergency visit by U.N. special envoy
Lakhdar Brahimi.
	   Brahimi arrived in Luanda Friday evening in the midst of
escalating tension between the government and the former rebel
movement UNITA.
	   The U.N.-Secretary General Kofi Annan's special representative
is due to confer with western diplomats over the weekend before
holding talks with President Jose Eduardo dos Santos on Monday and
with UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi on Tuesday.
	   Brahimi will urge Angola's former foes to stick to the terms of
the U.N.-brokered 1994 peace accord which sealed a tenuous end to
their devastating two-decade civil war.
	   Saturday's armed forces' statement denied reports by the U.N.
mission in Luanda on July 23 that the government army had recently
been forcibly recruiting young males.
	   The army and police statement said the military already has the
capacity to respond to any emergency war situation.
	   Implementation of the peace deal is running far behind schedule,
embedded in mutual distrust and a cross fire of accusations.
	   The government has blamed UNITA for a massacre of more than 100
civilians in a remote northeastern village last week. A U.N.
investigation was unable to establish the identity of the
perpetrators.
	   Brahimi was also due to leave Wednesday for a tour of
neighboring nations whose leaders are close to either Dos Santos or
Savimbi. Details of his itinerary were not available.
	   Brahimi, also the U.N. chief's special representative to
Afghanistan, was to make recommendations about the future U.N.
presence in Angola.
	   These included whether a replacement should be named for Alioune
Blondin Beye _ the special U.N. representative to Angola who was a
key promoter of the 1994 peace deal _ perished in an air crash in
the Ivory Coast on June 26th. The U.N. mandate ends Aug. 15.
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ was supposed to have demobilized its
70,000-strong guerrilla army under the peace deal. But the
government claims it maintains armed men hidden in the bush of this
vast southwest African nation.

Spanish arson suspects say they acted out of thwarted love
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Two young men told Spanish police that they
set a series of forest fires in order to get back at a restaurant
owner who had forced his daughter to break up with one of them.
	   The blazes burned for five days late last month in the northeast
Catalonia region, charring 27,000 hectares (67,000 acres) of
forest, scrubland and crops and forcing the evacuation of hundreds
of people.
	   Aided by temperatures over 38 C (100 F), the fires were blamed
for three deaths _ a man who suffered a heart attack as he watched
his house burn and two firefighters who died in a helicopter crash.
	   The arson suspects were arrested Thursday by police who traced
their car license plates to a village.
	   They told authorities they sought revenge against the father of
the girlfriend of one of them. The father, who disapproved of the
relationship, owned a restaurant in one of 10 rural areas where the
suspects confessed to setting fires.
	   They said their goal was to choke off business at the
restaurant, the newspaper El Mundo reported. Officials could not
immediately be reached for comment.
	   The fires spread rapidly across an area 100 kilometers (62
miles) northwest of Barcelona, burning themselves into a single
blaze that was the worst to hit Catalonia since 1994.
	   A judge has ordered the men jailed pending trial. If convicted
they face sentences of 20 years in jail.
	   They were identified as Josep Maria Fernandez Barons, 23, and
Josep Maria Puig Oviedo, 24.

Islamic militants assault newspaper editor, AP reporters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Islamic militants protesting outside a
pro-democracy newspaper today in Iran assaulted its editor and
threatened him with death, witnesses and staff members said.
	   The protesters also punched and kicked two Associated Press
reporters who went to the scene later.
	   Tous editor Mahmoud Shams said about 30 unidentified youths
demonstrating on the street confronted him outside the building as
he arrived for work, and someone punched him in the face. Witnesses
and staff members confirmed the account.
	   Fearing more trouble, Shams' colleagues whisked him away in a
car. He returned after the protesters left voluntarily.
	   The popular Tous newspaper, known for its outspoken views on
Iranian politics, resumed publishing last week after skirting a ban
by the hard-line ruling clergy, which controls radical Islamic
groups.
	   Shams told reporters that his attackers ``told me ... `we are
here to kill you.'''
	   AP reporters Anwar Faruqi and Afshin Valinejad, who went to the
Tous office after hearing about the trouble, were stopped by the
protesters and told to leave.
	   Faruqi said that when he asked why, about a dozen men started
pushing the two AP reporters.
	   Faruqi, an AP correspondent based in Dubai, fell to the ground
and about five attackers punched and kicked him in the neck,
stomach and legs. His shirt was ripped and his hands and legs bled.
	   Valinejad, the AP's Tehran reporter, was kicked in the groin.
	   Faruqi said the attack lasted between five and seven minutes.
Faruqi said a few policemen standing nearby intervened, pulling
away the attackers and giving the AP reporters a chance to escape.
	   There were no other reporters on the scene at the time.
	   Faruqi, a Pakistani citizen, and Valinejad, an Iranian, were
shaken but did not need hospitalization.
	   Later, the protesters told other reporters that they had not
assaulted any journalists. They also said they were not affiliated
with any group. Militant groups associated with the hard-line
clergy have broken up pro-democracy demonstrations and attacked
newspapers in the past.

Russian premier discusses Chechen economic troubles in semi-secret

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko held unusual,
semi-secret talks Saturday with Chechen president Aslan Maskhadov
in an effort to shore up the regime of Russia's erstwhile enemy.
	   Maskhadov _ who led Chechnya's war for independence and was
elected president 18 months ago _ has been shaken by a fresh wave
of violence in and around the republic that included an attempt to
assassinate him.
	   ``The Republic of Chechnya has a legally elected government, a
legally elected president, and we will do everything possible to
support this government,'' Kiriyenko said after the meeting,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   President Boris Yeltsin ordered Kiriyenko to hold the meeting in
part to express Moscow's support for the Chechen president, even
though Maskhadov remains a firm advocate of Chechen independence.
	   However, Russia considers Maskhadov a moderate who is trying to
control Chechnya's diverse and well-armed bands of fighters. It
fears that if he were to fall a more radical leader could come to
power.
	   Because of security concerns, the location of the meeting _ at a
government residence 30 kilometers (20 miles) outside Nazran, the
capital of the Caucasus republic of Ingushetia _ was announced only
after it was underway.
	   The two leaders spoke for several hours, and discussed the
possibility of making Chechnya a special economic zone, the
Interfax news agency reported. However, no new agreements were
announced, Interfax said.
	   The talks were Maskhadov's first high-level negotiations with a
Russian leader since he held a summit with Yeltsin in Moscow last
August.
	   Maskhadov said his prime objective in the meeting was to tell
Kiriyenko, who became premier in April, that Russia has failed to
provide financial support promised under a peace treaty signed in
May 1997.
	   ``The Chechen people are tired of Russia's many promises, which
have remained just that _ promises,'' Maskhadov said.
	   The cease-fire and treaty that ended the 1994-1996 Chechen war
did not resolve the vital question of Chechnya's political status.
Chechnya runs its own affairs and considers itself independent, but
Moscow and the rest of the world treats it as part of Russia.
	   Chechen officials long have accused the Kremlin of failing to
fulfill its promises to rebuild the republic's war-battered
economy.
	   For their part, Russian officials consider Chechnya a prime
source of violence and crime, including kidnappings, and have
demanded more effective crime-fighting from the Chechen government.
	   On July 23, Maskhadov narrowly escaped assassination in a car
bombing that killed two of his bodyguards. He first blamed Russian
secret services for the attack, then suggested rival Chechen
leaders could also be involved.

Cyprus to seek Turkey's expulsion from Council of Europe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Cyprus will seek Turkey's expulsion from
the Council of Europe if it fails to comply with a European Court
ruling on refugee rights, the foreign minister said Saturday.
	   He was commenting on the rejection by both Turkey and Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash of Tuesday's ruling favoring a Greek
Cypriot refugee.
	   ``Our stand is that Turkey must comply. If it does not, it must
face the consequences which begin with sanctions and end with its
expulsion from the Council of Europe,'' the minister, Yiannakis
Cassoulides, said.
	   He did not elaborate on what steps Cyprus will take to seek
Turkey's expulsion.
	   The Strasbourg-based European Court of Human Rights ordered
Turkey to pay 320,000 Cyprus pounds (dlrs 704,000) to Titina
Loizidou for depriving her of the use and access to her property in
Kyrenia, a town in Turkish-occupied north Cyprus.
	   The court held that Turkey, as the occupying power, was
responsible for her losing her land in the north. It rejected any
legal status for the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the north,
which is recognized only by Ankara which maintains 35,000 troops
there.
	   The Cyprus government hailed the ruling as a landmark decision
that ``sets a legal precedent'' for all the 180,000 Greek Cypriot
refugees who fled or were expelled from the north in the wake of
the 1974 Turkish invasion. The invasion was sparked by an abortive
coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   A Turkish foreign ministry statement Thursday said the court's
ruling cannot be applied or implemented in the Turkish-occupied
Cyprus.
	   It repeated the Turkish contention that responsibility for
developments in the north lies with the Turkish Cypriot state and
not Turkey.
	   On Friday, Denktash demanded reversal of the court decision as a
pre-condition for returning to the UN-sponsored peace talks with
the Greek Cypriot side for the reunification of the island.
	   He walked out of the talks in August last year demanding
recognition of his breakaway state and cancellation of the European
Union's entry negotiations with Cyprus.

Angolan military denies forced recruitment as U.N envoy begins
</HEADLINE>
mission &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The Angolan armed forces on Saturday
denied U.N. allegations that they have begun a forced recruitment
drive in response to the country's apparent slide back into civil
war.
	   The denial, in a joint statement by the army and police, came on
the first day of an emergency visit by U.N. envoy Lakhdar Brahimi.
	   Brahimi arrived in Luanda on Friday amid escalating tension
between the government and the former rebel movement UNITA.
	   The envoy from U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan was due to
confer with Western diplomats over the weekend before holding talks
with President Jose Eduardo dos Santos on Monday and with UNITA
leader Jonas Savimbi on Tuesday.
	   Brahimi was to urge Angola's former foes to stick to the terms
of the U.N.-brokered 1994 accord that seemed to seal their
devastating two-decade civil war.
	   Saturday's armed forces statement denied reports by the U.N.
mission in Luanda on July 23 that the army had recently been
forcibly recruiting young men.
	   The statement said the military already has the capacity to
respond to any emergency war situation.
	   Implementation of the peace deal in the former Portuguese colony
is far behind schedule, bogged down in mutual distrust and a
cross-fire of accusations.
	   UNITA, a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola, was supposed to have demobilized its
70,000-member guerrilla army under the peace deal. But the
government claims it maintains armed men hidden in the bush of the
vast southwest African nation.
	   The government has blamed UNITA for a massacre of more than 100
civilians in a remote northeastern village last week. A U.N.
investigation was unable to establish the identity of the
perpetrators.
	   Brahimi was due to leave Wednesday for a tour of neighboring
nations whose leaders are close to either Dos Santos or Savimbi.
Details of his itinerary were not available.
	   Brahimi, also the U.N. chief's envoy to Afghanistan, was to make
recommendations about the future U.N. presence in Angola. The U.N.
mandate ends Aug. 15.
	   Discussions included whether a replacement should be named for
Alioune Blondin Beye, the U.N. envoy to Angola who perished in an
air crash in the Ivory Coast on June 26.

Investigation of attack on French policeman nearly complete
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ The investigation of German soccer thugs
for the brutal beating a French police officer during the World Cup
in late June is nearly completed, Der Spiegel magazine said
Saturday.
	   The Hamburg-based magazine said that with the aid of numerous
photographs and video clips, a special German police team and the
Lower Saxony state prosecutor in Hanover have been able to
reconstruct how the soccer thugs beat 44-year-old Daniel Nivel into
a coma on the evening of June 21 in Lens, France.
	   The attack came after the German-Yugoslav game when dozens of
German soccer thugs clashed with French police.
	   In Hanover, prosecutor Nickolaus Borchers confirmed in part the
Spiegel report, saying three arrested hooligans, identified only as
Andre Z., 27, Tobias R., 30, and Frank R., 24, are jailed on
suspicion of joint attempted murder, dangerous bodily injury, and
breach of the peace in the attack on Nivel.
	   However, Borchers declined to confirm that another soccer thug
was still being sought in the case, as the Spiegel report said.
	   Borchers said that a 23-year-old man, who had been in
investigative custody in the case, was released Tuesday, although
he is still being investigated for dangerous bodily injury and
breach of the peace.
	   In addition, of two men arrested by French police shortly after
the attack, only Markus Warnecke remains jailed and the other has
been released, the prosecutor said.
	   Spiegel said the two were no longer considered the main suspects
in the attack on Nivel who remains hospitalized in a coma.
	   According to Borchers, numerous details uncovered in the
investigation are still being checked. The investigation can be
completed and charges filed ``at the latest in three months,'' he
said.

Hakkinen gains pole position for German GP; Schumacher far behind
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HOCKENHEIM, Germany (AP) _ Mika Hakkinen of Finland grabbed the
pole position Saturday for the German Grand Prix, while his closest
rival for the Formula One title, Michael Schumacher, lagged behind
in ninth place.
	   Hakkinen, who also dominated the practice runs, had a smooth
qualifying session and now looks set to win Sunday's race.
	   Hakkinen's McLaren-Mercedes teammate David Coulthard was second,
while defending champion Jacques Villeneuve was third in his
Williams-Mecachrome, equaling his best starting-grid position this
season.
	   The Ferraris struggled all day.
	   In the morning practice sessions, Schumacher lost 45 minutes
after a spin in a curve. He then suffered an engine failure in the
second session. In the afternoon's one-hour qualifying session,
Schumacher was never in contention.
	   His ninth place is the worst this season in qualifying for the
two-time champion, who trails Hakkinen eight points in the drivers'
standings.
	   For the first time this season, Schumacher was beaten by his
Ferrari teammate, Eddie Irvine, in the qualifying. Irvine was
sixth.
	   Schumacher's younger brother, Ralf, completed the second row on
the starting grid by posting the fourth fastest time in his Jordan.
	   He was followed by former champion Damon Hill in the second
Jordan, the best showing by the team in qualifying this season.
	   Following Irvine came the two Benettons, Alexander Wurz in
seventh place and Giancarlo Fisichella in the eighth.
	   Hakkinen clocked a time of one minute, 41.838 seconds on the
high-speed 6.8-kilometer (4.2-mile) circuit.
	   Coulthard was .509 seconds behind, while Villeneuve was .527
seconds slower.
	   Michael Schumacher was 1.621 seconds behind and will have to
start from the fifth row.
	   McLaren has taken the in all but one of this season's races.
Sunday's race is the 11th in the 16-race season.

Battered opposition needs win in Mexican governor's race

	   AGUASCALIENTES, Mexico (AP) _ Battered by losses, Mexico's
opposition National Action Party desperately needs to win Sunday's
gubernatorial election in the tiny state of Aguascalientes.
	   And it may _ thanks in part to its rival's economic
achievements.
	   The central Mexican state could be the party's only chance to
win a governor's seat this year and remain a strong political force
ahead of the 2000 presidential elections.
	   The center-right party, known by its Spanish initials as the
PAN, is trying to bounce back from two major defeats.
	   Last year, it finished a distant third in the Mexico City
mayoral race. And last month, it lost one of its six gubernatorial
seats after being defeated by the governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, in the northern state of Chihuahua.
	   The PRI was expected to win at least two of Sunday's three
elections. In Veracruz, opinion polls have shown Miguel Aleman, a
wealthy businessman and son of a former president, with a huge lead
over three rivals. In Oaxaca, Sen. Jose Murat Casab was expected to
hold off a challenge from the center-left Democratic Revolution
Party.
	   But in Aguascalientes, the race was tight between the PAN's
candidate, businessman Felipe Gonzalez Gonzalez, and the PRI's
Hector Hugo Olivares Ventura, a former senator and federal deputy.
The candidate for the center-left Democratic Revolution Party,
Alfonso Bernal Sahagun, was a distant third. The incumbent, Otto
Granados, cannot seek reelection.
	   Six years ago, Granados won the governorship with almost 75
percent of the vote. The PAN's new strength shows how the state has
changed since then.
	   While most of the country has struggled to recover from the 1994
economic crisis, Aguascalientes has prospered, attracting
multinational businesses. Once primarily rural, Aguascalientes has
become a largely urban state with many middle-class, well-educated
voters _ the very voters that tend to favor the business-oriented
PAN.
	   ``Granados has done a superb job as governor, at least in the
economic field,'' said George Grayson, a Mexico expert at the
College of William and Mary in Virginia. ``The irony is that those
conditions create more `PANistas'''
	   Gonzalez denied that the PRI is responsible for the state's
prosperity.
	   ``We're doing well in spite of the PRI,'' he said.
	   The PAN has already had successes in the state, winning a
majority in the state legislature and the mayor's seat in the state
capital, also named Aguascalientes.
	   Despite the national implications of the race, both candidates
said in interviews that they expect votes will be cast based on
their qualifications and state issues _ not national politics. The
campaigns have stressed the candidates' qualifications. Personal
attacks have been frequent.
	   Olivares sees a way that the PRI, which for most of its 69 years
had almost exclusive control of Mexican politics, could benefit
from the PAN's successes in winning the mayor's seat in the capital
and other local elections.
	   ``Now they aren't only the opposition, but the government,'' he
said. ``They will have to withstand voters who are much more
critical.''

is due to confer with western diplomats over the weekend before
holding talks with President Jose Eduardo dos Santos on Monday and
with UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi on Tuesday.
	   Brahimi will urge Angola's former foes to stick to the terms of
the U.N.-brokered 1994 peace accord which sealed a tenuous end to
their devastating two-decade civil war.
	   Saturday's armed forces' statement denied reports by the U.N.
mission in Luanda on July 23 that the government army had recently
been forcibly recruiting young males.
	   The army and police statement said the military already has the
capacity to respond to any emergency war situation.
	   Implementation of the peace deal is running far behind schedule,
embedded in mutual distrust and a cross fire of accusations.
	   The government has blamed UNITA for a massacre of more than 100
civilians in a remote northeastern village last week. A U.N.
investigation was unable to establish the identity of the
perpetrators.
	   Brahimi was also due to leave Wednesday for a tour of
neighboring nations whose leaders are close to either Dos Santos or
Savimbi. Details of his itinerary were not available.
	   Brahimi, also the U.N. chief's special representative to
Afghanistan, was to make recommendations about the future U.N.
presence in Angola.
	   These included whether a replacement should be named for Alioune
Blondin Beye _ the special U.N. representative to Angola who was a
key promoter of the 1994 peace deal _ perished in an air crash in
the Ivory Coast on June 26th. The U.N. mandate ends Aug. 15.
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ was supposed to have demobilized its
70,000-strong guerrilla army under the peace deal. But the
government claims it maintains armed men hidden in the bush of this
vast southwest African nation.

Indonesian Chinese hold mass prayer for rioting victims

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ About 300 people, many of them ethnic
Chinese, gathered on a soccer field Saturday to hold a mass prayer
for victims of deadly nationwide rioting in May.
	   Muslims, Christians and Buddhists sat on the grass as they
listened to sermons by priests of their different religions. At
dusk, they lit candles.
	   The participants wore white headbands as an expression of
condolence for those who lost their lives or property during the
turbulence that led to the downfall of former President Suharto
after 32 years in power.
	   About 1,200 people died in rioting over price increases in
Jakarta that was triggered when security forces shot and killed
four students at a pro-democracy demonstration. Women's groups say
at least 168 women were raped by rioters.
	   Many of the victims were members of the ethnic Chinese minority,
which is often made a scapegoat in difficult times. Indonesia is
undergoing its worst economic crisis in decades.
	   The Chinese, who make up just 4 percent of Indonesia's 200
million people, are resented in part because they control much of
the economy and enjoy relative wealth. Most Chinese are Christians
or Buddhist in predominately Muslim Indonesia.
	   ``Please avoid any more violence, rioting and unrest in
Indonesia,'' Father Padmo Saputro, a Roman Catholic priest, said in
a sermon. ``We appeal for all the people not to hurt each other.''
	   The mass prayer was organized by local community groups,
including human rights activists.

	   AGUASCALIENTES, Mexico (AP) _ Battered by losses, Mexico's
opposition National Action Party desperately needs to win Sunday's
gubernatorial election in the tiny state of Aguascalientes.
	   And it may _ thanks in part to its rival's economic
achievements.
	   The central Mexican state could be the party's only chance to
win a governor's seat this year and remain a strong political force
ahead of the 2000 presidential elections.
	   The center-right party, known by its Spanish initials as the
PAN, is trying to bounce back from two major defeats.
	   Last year, it finished a distant third in the Mexico City
mayoral race. And last month, it lost one of its six gubernatorial
seats after being defeated by the governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, in the northern state of Chihuahua.
	   The PRI was expected to win at least two of Sunday's three
elections. In Veracruz, opinion polls have shown Miguel Aleman, a
wealthy businessman and son of a former president, with a huge lead
over three rivals. In Oaxaca, Sen. Jose Murat Casab was expected to
hold off a challenge from the center-left Democratic Revolution
Party.
	   But in Aguascalientes, the race was tight between the PAN's
candidate, businessman Felipe Gonzalez Gonzalez, and the PRI's
Hector Hugo Olivares Ventura, a former senator and federal deputy.
The candidate for the center-left Democratic Revolution Party,
Alfonso Bernal Sahagun, was a distant third. The incumbent, Otto
Granados, cannot seek reelection.
	   Six years ago, Granados won the governorship with almost 75
percent of the vote. The PAN's new strength shows how the state has
changed since then.
	   While most of the country has struggled to recover from the 1994
economic crisis, Aguascalientes has prospered, attracting
multinational businesses. Once primarily rural, Aguascalientes has
become a largely urban state with many middle-class, well-educated
voters _ the very voters that tend to favor the business-oriented
PAN.
	   ``Granados has done a superb job as governor, at least in the
economic field,'' said George Grayson, a Mexico expert at the
College of William and Mary in Virginia. ``The irony is that those
conditions create more `PANistas'''
	   Gonzalez denied that the PRI is responsible for the state's
prosperity.
	   ``We're doing well in spite of the PRI,'' he said.
	   The PAN has already had successes in the state, winning a
majority in the state legislature and the mayor's seat in the state
capital, also named Aguascalientes.
	   Despite the national implications of the race, both candidates
said in interviews that they expect votes will be cast based on
their qualifications and state issues _ not national politics. The
campaigns have stressed the candidates' qualifications. Personal
attacks have been frequent.
	   Olivares sees a way that the PRI, which for most of its 69 years
had almost exclusive control of Mexican politics, could benefit
from the PAN's successes in winning the mayor's seat in the capital
and other local elections.
	   ``Now they aren't only the opposition, but the government,'' he
said. ``They will have to withstand voters who are much more
critical.''

Giants' pitcher Galvez to be sent home after throwing ball at
</HEADLINE>
umpire
 &UR; By MARI YAMAGUCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Yomiuri Giants suspended former Texas Rangers
pitcher Balvino Galves on Saturday and plan to send him back to the
United States for throwing a ball at an umpire.
	   Galvez was ejected from Friday's game with the Hanshin Tigers
after firing the ball at home plate umpire Atsushi Kittaka.
	   Central League president Sumiko Takahara announced Saturday that
the Giants had suspended the Dominican hurler for the rest of the
season. The club was also expected to fine Galves, although the
amount was not known.
	   ``The outburst, which was almost madness, called for a severe
penalty because it was an action that went against the spirit of
sportsmanship,'' said Takahara.
	   ``The ball is supposed to be a sacred object for a pitcher and
as a professional, the action was absolutely unacceptable,'' she
was quoted as saying by Kyodo News.
	   The departure of the starter was seen as a major loss for the
Giants.
	   Galvez had a 9-7 record so far this year _ second for the Giants
only to the injured Cho Sung-min _ and led the league with 16 wins
in 1996.
	   Galves, 34, erupted after giving up a home run to Hanshin Tigers
hitter Tomochika Tsuboi in the sixth inning of a game Friday night,
venting his anger at home plate umpire Kittaka who had called the
previous pitch a ball.
	   Galves was pulled from the game, but as he approached the Giants
dugout along the third base line, he suddenly turned and fired the
ball at Kittaka.
	   Galvez missed, but the throw set off a melee as Kittaka ran
toward the enraged pitcher, signaling for him to be ejected from
the game. The burly Galvez lunged at Kittaka with fists raised but
was restrained by teammates and coaches from striking the umpire.
	   The scene was replayed on Japanese television news throughout
the day Saturday.
	   ``I regret what happened last night and I apologize for the
trouble I have caused to all the Japanese fans,'' Galvez said
through an interpreter in a nationally televised news conference.
	   Galvez said his frustrations with the way the umpire had called
the game had exploded all at once.
	   Giants general manager Hiroyuki Yamamuro also apologized on
behalf of his star hurler.
	   ``We apologize deeply to the fans. This is an extremely painful
measure, but the club has taken a forceful action to put this
behind us.''
	   Japan's wildly popular brand of baseball is frequently marred by
brawls. Umpires often get little respect and can be intimidated
into changing their calls.
	   American umpire Mike DiMuro was sent to Japan last year to try
to change that tradition by introducing Japanese ball clubs to the
tougher U.S. officiating style, although he quit after being
roughed up by a player.
	   The Giants lost Friday's game 6-1.

Heavy rain kills people in South Korea
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATEs throughout with death toll rising to 20 from 14,
details

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Gushing streams swollen by torrential
rains hit hundreds of sleeping mountain campers, killing at least
20 people and leaving dozens more missing, disaster relief
headquarters said Saturday.
	   The downpours, which dumped up to 30 centimeters (12 inches) of
rain overnight in the southern provinces, also washed away roads,
triggered landslides and submerged homes and farm fields.
	   Most of the 70 people reported missing were swept away by the
sudden rise in water levels in valleys around Chiri Mountains, a
famous trekking and camping site 220 kilometers (137 miles) south
of Seoul.
	   Hundreds of mountain campers remained stranded. Rescuers used
helicopters and ropes to guide the marooned campers across raving
streams to safety.
	   Disaster officials feared the casualty figures could rise as
communications with remote areas are restored.
	   Kang Byung-ho, 38, and three family members were crushed to
death when their home collapsed under a landslide. Villagers pulled
up the body of a baby girl floating in flood water. A 29-year-old
farmer was electrocuted while using an electric pump.
	   Weather forecasters failed to predict the heavy rains and many
summer vacationers in mountains and rivers were caught unprepared.
	   In the Chiri mountains, a record 14 centimeters (5.6 inches) of
rain poured down in one hour, weather officials said.
	   ``It rained so hard it looked as if somebody was pouring buckets
of water over our tent. Soon the flood came and engulfed the
tent,'' Lim June-hyun, a 13-year-old camper, told SBC-TV.
	   Two airports were closed due to slick runways. Train services
were halted in the southwestern Cholla province when a landslide
triggered by flash floods covered 30 meters (yards) of rail. Police
also reported many road and railway cave-ins.
	   Ferry routes also halted operations and vacationers were
evacuated from beaches as weather officials issued storm warnings
along the coasts.
	   Police also reported a sharp increase in traffic accidents on
the nation's rain-drenched highways. In one accident, a bus skidded
off the road and overturned, injuring 30 passengers.
	   At least 100 homes remained underwater, leaving 300 people
homeless, officials said. TV footage showed large stretches of rice
fields underwater and cars swept away in flood water.
	   Gen. Kim Dong-shin, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
ordered the military to provide manpower and machinery to help
relief operations.
	   Weather officials expected more rain in the southern provinces
until Sunday.

Rival East African ministers share flight to talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BRAHIMA OUEDRAOGO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ While refusing to meet over a
bitter border dispute, the foreign ministers of Ethiopia and
Eritrea shared the same plane Saturday to this West African country
for talks with mediators.
	   Eritrea's Haile Woldetensae and Ethiopia's Seyoum Mesfin, who
are scheduled to meet separately with African diplomats on Sunday
morning, were quickly whisked away to different hotels from the
airport in Ouagadougou by two groups of Burkina Faso foreign
ministry diplomats.
	   Burkina Faso officials said it had been purely coincidental that
the ministers from the feuding countries on the Horn of Africa had
taken the same Air Afrique passenger flight from Abidjan, Ivory
Coast.
	   The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, declined
to say whether the antagonists had made any contact.
	   Fighting broke out between the neighboring East African
countries in mid-May, and in early June both sides bombed each
other's territory. Several hundred people _ perhaps more _ perished
before the fighting subsided in mid-June.
	   Mediators led by Organization of African Unity secretary-general
Salim Ahmed Salim will hold a series of meetings Sunday to offer
peace proposals to the feuding sides.
	   Zimbabwe's Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge and his Djibouti
counterpart, Mohammed Musa Sheahim, are also taking part.
	   Burkina Faso's President Blaise Campaore, who in June led a
peace mission to the feuding countries in his capacity as the new
OAU chairman, is hosting the latest round on his home soil but it
is not clear if he will directly participate.
	   The opponents are only expected to meet face-to-face if they
first accept the peace proposals, which remain secret and are still
being finalized, Burkina Faso's Foreign Minister Ablasse Ouedraogo
said Saturday.
	   ``We are going to invite the two ministers (of Ethiopia and
Eritrea) to join us together when the time is ripe,'' Ouedraogo
said.
	   Both Ethiopia and Eritrea have massed troops along the contested
portion of the border and the situation is at a stalemate.
	   Ethiopia says it was Eritrea's invasion of the two districts of
Badme and Shiraro on May 6 on the western end of the 960-kilometer
(600-mile) border that precipitated the crisis and subsequent
fighting.
	   Eritrea has called Ethiopia's saber-rattling a ``bluff'' to
maneuver the international community into pressuring Eritrea to
withdraw. The two countries were one until Eritrea won its
independence in 1993.
	   As many as 100,000 people have been displaced by the fighting,
according to one U.N. estimate. Ethiopia puts the figure at 180,000
while Eritrea says 100,000 of its people alone have been forced to
flee the conflict.

Havel may undergo another tracheotomy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Czech President Vaclav Havel may
have to undergo another tracheotomy after part of his lung
collapsed while he was taken off the respirator, said a medical
report carried by the news agency CTK Saturday.
	   Doctors have promptly treated what is called atelectasis in
medical parlance but still consider performing tracheotomy, in
which a small artificial breathing hole is made in the throat.
	   In April, the 61-year-old president was rushed to a hospital in
Innsbruck, Austria, from a nearby Alpine resort where he was
vacationing after doctors diagnosed a ruptured colon and acute
peritonitis.
	   An artificial duct was inserted during the surgery in Innsbruck.
Last week's follow-up operation in Prague was designed to remove
the duct and reconnect Havel's large intestine to the rest of the
digestive tract.
	   In both cases, Havel's recovery was slowed down by infections
and breathing problems. The president underwent tracheotomy in
Innsbruck after phlegm blocked his windpipe.
	   Havel, formerly a chain-smoker, has been hospitalized five time
since December 1996 when he had a third of his lung and a tumor
removed.
	   On Thursday, doctors reported a brief period of blood infection
caused by intravenous feeding, but they played down the incident as
common in early stages of recovery.
	   The post-surgery wound was healing well, according to Saturday's
report. Havel is still being fed intravenously but he is now able
to get more food.
	   Doctors have declined to predict when Havel would be fit enough
to resume his duties, but he is expected to stay out of political
life for the rest of the summer.

	   TAKHMAU, Cambodia (AP) _ As preliminary final results began to
be announced from Cambodia's general election, Co-Prime Minister
Hun Sen on Saturday called on his security forces not to terrorize
members of the opposition in acts of political revenge.
	   Hun Sen, the strongman whose Cambodian People's Party is
projected to have topped the polls in all but one of 23
constituencies, threatened to arrest and punish anyone who tried to
intimidate or harm opposition members.
	   ``Any act to intimidate anyone is illegal, immoral and
unforgivable,'' he said, responding to reports that scores of
scared supporters of Prince Norodom Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party and
the Sam Rainsy Party have fled to Phnom Penh from the countryside,
seeking refuge at their parties' headquarters.
	   ``It doesn't matter if they voted for us, against us, or even
cursed us... There must not be any retribution,'' he said in a
speech broadcast on state-run television.
	   The government's National Election Committee on Saturday
announced preliminary official results from seven of 23
constituencies.
	   There are 122 parliamentary seats at stake, and it appears that
Hun Sen's ruling party will win a majority of them. Final results
will be given only after computer tallies are reconciled with
actual local counts.
	   Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh as his co-premier in a violent coup
d'etat a year ago, dismantling much of his political machine in the
process.
	   He went forward with the election in hopes of a return to
political stability, as well as restore his legitimacy in the eyes
of the international community and foreign aid suspended after his
takeover.
	   Hun Sen said Saturday that after all the votes are counted a new
government should be formed as quickly as possible so that Cambodia
will be able to take back its seat at the United Nations, which has
been left vacant since last year's coup.
	   He urged his political opponents to reach a compromise.
	   While the official election committee said Saturday that the
release of comprehensive election results was likely to be delayed,
a projection by the country's biggest independent poll-watching
group tally showed Hun Sen's party was likely to win 64 assembly
seats.
	   The president of the Committee for Free and Fair Elections in
Cambodia, Thun Saray, said that his organization had counted close
to 90 percent of the results. He predicted that FUNCINPEC would win
43 seats and that the Sam Rainsy Party would win 15 seats.
	   Opposition leaders Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have threatened to
boycott the next National Assembly session unless their concerns
about vote counting irregularities are addressed.
	   Without the opposition's attendance, the assembly is unlikely to
have present the two-thirds of its 122 members needed to conduct
essential business.
	   Hun Sen has offered to form a coalition government with his
former foes, but Ranariddh and Rainsy have said they would not
consider the offer until ballots in contested areas are recounted.
	   Poll-watcher Thun Saray also expressed concern about
post-election violence and intimidation directed against members of
opposition parties.
	   He said he had received reports from the provinces of Takeo,
Kampong Cham and Prey Veng of 29 political party activists who had
been threatened since the election.
	   ``These incidents were mostly direct verbal threats but included
other forms of intimidating behavior,'' he said, speculating that
in some cases ruling party supporters were proud of their victory
and wanted to show off their new strength and influence.
	   But his group also noted that that voting procedures at more
than 90 percent of the country's polling stations ``went smoothly
and without incident'' during the election.
	   It said some serious violations had been reported by its
observers during last Sunday's polls, but the cases were believed
to represent scattered incidents.

Havel may undergo another tracheotomy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Czech President Vaclav Havel may
have to undergo another tracheotomy because part of his lung
collapsed while he was off a respirator, said a report carried by
the news agency CTK Saturday.
	   Doctors have promptly treated what is called atelectasis in
medical parlance but were still considering performing a
tracheotomy, in which a small artificial breathing hole is made in
the throat.
	   In April, the 61-year-old president was rushed to a hospital in
Innsbruck, Austria, from a nearby Alpine resort where he was
vacationing after doctors diagnosed a ruptured colon and acute
peritonitis.
	   An artificial duct was inserted during the surgery in Innsbruck.
Last week's follow-up operation in Prague was designed to remove
the duct and reconnect Havel's large intestine to the rest of the
digestive tract.
	   In both cases, Havel's recovery was slowed by infections and
breathing problems. The president underwent a tracheotomy in
Innsbruck after phlegm blocked his windpipe.
	   Havel, formerly a chain smoker, has been hospitalized five times
since December 1996, when he had a third of his lung and a tumor
removed.
	   On Thursday, doctors reported a brief period of blood infection
caused by intravenous feeding, but they played down the incident as
common in early stages of recovery.
	   The post-surgery wound was healing well, according to Saturday's
report. Havel was still being fed intravenously but he was able to
get more food.
	   Doctors have declined to predict when Havel will be fit enough
to resume his duties, but he is expected to stay out of political
life for the rest of the summer.

China floods worsen, more deaths reported
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Floodwaters rose Saturday along the swollen
Yangtze River, as state-run media reported new flooding in southern
China and in the northeast.
	   Seven people died in a flash flood caused by torrential rains in
southern Jiangxi province, and a militia official was killed during
rescue operations along the Yangtze, the Xinhua News Agency
reported Saturday.
	   The new deaths raised to at least 1,268 the number of people
killed in this summer's floods, fed by seasonal rains that began
earlier and have been heavier than usual.
	   State-run television news broadcasts showed houses inundated to
their roofs along the Zhenjiang in southern Guangdong province, as
well as along the Nenjiang in northeastern Heilongjiang province.
	   Water levels have continued to rise in the middle stretches of
the Yangtze, near the industrial cities of Wuhan and Nanjing,
jeopardizing waterlogged levees already threatened with collapse,
the television reports said.

Dozens flown from Kosovo to homeland in Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Seventy-six members of the Adyg minority, also
known as Circassians, flew from the Kosovo region of Yugoslavia to
their historic homeland in southern Russia on Saturday, Russian
media reported.
	   Forty-two families who descended from Adygs who settled in the
Kosovo region during the last century, when it was part of the
Ottoman Empire, have been living in two villages outside the Kosovo
capital Pristina, the Moscow News newspaper reported this week.
	   Ethnic Albanians who dominate Kosovo consider the small, Muslim
minority too supportive of the Serbs, whom they are fighting for
independence, the newspaper said. Since the Kosovo conflict
exploded earlier this year, the Adygs have been ``sitting on their
suitcases,'' Moscow News said.
	   A second group of Adygs is to arrive in Russia this month via
Bulgaria and the Black Sea, the Interfax news agency reported on
Saturday.
	   ``Adygeya is ready to receive its compatriots from Kosovo,''
said Aslan Karashev, media minister of the Adyg republic in the
North Caucasus region of Russia, according to Interfax.
	   The Adygs are being brought by Russia's Ministry of Emergency
Situations. They will be housed in a former kindergarten and given
plots of land to cultivate.

Palestinian security chief slams Hamas in interview
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IMAD MUSA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ For the second time in a week, a top
Palestinian security official slammed Hamas, suggesting the
possibility of a new crackdown on the militant Islamic movement.
	   Mohammed Dahlan, head of Preventive Security in the Gaza Strip,
told the London-based Arabic magazine al-Wasat that Hamas was ``an
obstacle to establishing the Palestinian Authority's political
achievements.''
	   Hamas, or the Islamic Resistance Movement, is the main
opposition to Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority. Hamas opposes
the Oslo peace accords and has claimed responsibility for suicide
bomb attacks that have killed scores of Israelis in recent years.
	   In the interview, published Saturday in the Ramallah-based
newspaper al-Ayyam, Dahlan said Hamas ``presents itself not as an
opposition group but as an alternative'' to the Palestinian
Authority.
	   Dahlan blamed Hamas for helping bring Israel's hard-line Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to power by carrying out a series of
suicide bombings before the May 1996 Israeli elections.
	   For most of Netanyahu's term, there have not been face-to-face
negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians, so ``Hamas is
destroying the Palestinian Authority and not just limiting it,''
Dahlan said.
	   Hamas spokesman Mahmoud Zahar said the group would have no
immediate response to Dahlan's remarks.
	   Dahlan also criticized Hamas' founder and spiritual leader,
Sheik Ahmed Yassin, who recently returned to Gaza from a
three-month fundraising tour of Arab states. Yassin has repeatedly
criticized Arafat's policies and advocated a return to armed
struggle.
	   ``The tour of Sheik Yassin was aimed at pressuring the
Palestinian Authority to make concessions,'' Dahlan said.
	   The Palestinian Authority has been accused by the United States
and Israel of releasing Hamas militants as fast as it arrests them,
but Dahlan said he would not bow to outside pressure on the matter.
	   ``We released them ... because we have no concerns about them
security-wise,'' he said.
	   Dahlan said he does not support trials for political prisoners
because trials ``are the demand of the Israeli prime minister.''
Palestinian security forces currently detain Hamas activists for
varying periods of time without trials, a practice that has drawn
condemnation from international human rights groups.
	   The security chief said that there was a ``common ground''
between the Palestinian Authority and Hamas leaders inside the
Palestinian areas, but that there was ``a tremendous gap'' with
Hamas leaders in other countries, who he said were ``far from
reality.''
	   Dahlan's counterpart in the West Bank, Jibril Rajoub, told
reporters last week that Hamas would not be allowed to become too
powerful.
	   ``I didn't take part in the national struggle for 18 years ...
to see Sheik Ahmed Yassin leading the Palestinian people,'' Rajoub
said.

Police, illegal immigrants hospitalized after escape attempt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Seven police officers and three Tunisians were in
hospital Saturday after a group of illegal immigrants broke out of
detention center in the Sicilian town of Syracuse.
	   The ANSA news agency said 40 Tunisians at a center made a break
for freedom late Friday night. All but six were recaptured, it
said.
	   It said the illegals set up the escape by drinking shampoo and
liquid soap, then claiming they were suffering from food poisoning.
When medical personnel and guards rushed to help them, they used
the confusion to stage the break .
	   The Tunisians, part of a flood of clandestine arrivals this
summer on Italian shores, armed themselves with improvised weapons
and fought their way out of the center, it said. Police ran down
most of them in the streets of the city.
	   It said seven police officers and three of the Tunisians were
hospitalized.
	   With clear sailing weather, boatload after boatload of would-be
immigrants, mostly from Tunisia, Morocco and other North African
countries, have landed on Italy's shores this summer.
	   The Italian government, once lenient with illegal arrivals, is
now detaining them and sending them home. Tensions have been high
in holding centers throughout southern Italy.
	   The Italian and Tunisian government have talks later this month
on ways to stem the tide of illegals. Italy is under pressure from
other European nations to tighten control of its borders and help
stop the flow of immigrants northward.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ One parachutist was killed and three others were
missing Saturday after a sudden gust of wind swept them into a lake
in northwestern Russia, the Ministry of Emergency Situations said.
	   The four were among eight parachutists taking part in training
jumps at an airport outside Petrozavodsk, about 700 kilometers (437
miles) north of Moscow, the Interfax news agency said. The wind
carried four of the parachutists into shallow water and four others
farther into the lake.
	   Rescuers pulled the body of one parachutist out of the lake but
three others remained lost, the ministry said late Saturday.

Skirmishes block a main road in Kosovo

saying talks are likely distant; CHANGES byline. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Despite assertions that Serbian
forces had regained control of all highways, skirmishes with
Kosovo's ethnic Albanian rebels kept part of a main north-south
road blocked, Serbian sources said Saturday.
	   Meanwhile, the International Committee of the Red Cross managed
to deliver food to refugees camping unsheltered in the area of
Prizren, near the Albanian border.
	   Thousands fled the recent fighting in Malisevo, a stronghold of
the underground Kosovo Liberation Army, which Serbian officials
said had been recaptured by government forces.
	   However, the death of a Serb policeman in the Malisevo area
early Saturday suggested that not all the rebel fighters had pulled
out. The policeman, Veroljub Ilic, was killed with a precise shot,
probably by a sniper, the pro-government Media Center in Pristina
said.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic assured a European Union
delegation Thursday that his week-long offensive was over. But he
made no pledge to withdraw Serb forces from Kosovo, a Serbian
province where ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the 2 million
inhabitants.
	   The KLA and ethnic Albanian politicians want independence for
Kosovo _ a province of Serbia, the stronger of two republics which
form Yugoslavia. But Serbs consider the province the cradle of
their culture, and Western powers prefer to see it remain part of
Serbia, as border changes in the Balkans often lead to further
bloodshed.
	   The KLA has resisted international calls to unite behind
moderate ethnic Albanian politician Ibrahim Rugova, who opposes
violence.
	   In Geneva, Red Cross spokesman Roland Sigler said Saturday that
the ICRC had been able to deliver food to the Malisevo refugees
camping near Prizren. He spoke of several tons of aid.
	   Sigler said there were about 30,000-35,000 refugees in the
southern town of Prizren, while a small number was left behind in
Malisevo.
	   U.S. special envoy Christopher Hill said Milosevic told him
Friday he would take ``personal responsibility'' for letting U.N.
and other aid workers deliver food, medicine, blankets and other
supplies to ethnic Albanians hiding in forested hills since Serb
forces drove the KLA from several strongholds.
	   Hill said Milosevic also promised to allow international
observers to escort the refugees back to their homes to prevent
abuse by Serb police or local authorities.
	   Police sources in Pristina, the Kosovo capital, said Saturday
that a stretch of the main Prizren-Pristina road was blocked
between the villages of Crnoljevo and Dulje.
	   They said police were trying to intercept small groups of KLA
fighters apparently trying to evacuate following their defeat in
Malisevo.
	   Sporadic fighting was reported to have been going on for some
time in the area and neither side was in effective control.
	   Adding to the tension was a bomb blast that destroyed a kiosk in
Pristina early Saturday. No one was injured.

Report: Iranian convicted in Bakhtiar slaying gets early release
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French authorities granted an early release to an
Iranian imprisoned for the 1991 assassination of a former prime
minister of Iran turned opposition leader, French radio reported
Saturday.
	   Massoud Hendi, sentenced in December 1994 to 10 years in prison
for complicity in the killing of Shahpour Bakhtiar, was freed
Thursday and is now in Tehran, according to France-Info radio.
	   French officials were not immediately available to confirm the
report, which comes days after the official announcement that
Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine will visit Tehran this month.
	   Hendi, about 50, a former Paris bureau chief of the Islamic
Republic of Iran broadcasting network, was convicted of helping
killers enter France from Switzerland. At the trial, Hendi
acknowledged procuring two visas for the killers as a favor to an
Iranian official, but said he did not know about the assassination
plot.
	   Bakhtiar, the last prime minister under toppled Shah Mohamed
Reza Pahlavi, became a leader of the Iranian exile opposition in
France. He was strangled and stabbed to death at his suburban Paris
home, along with his secretary.
	   Ali Vakili Rad, the convicted killer, was sentenced to life in
prison.
	   The Foreign Ministry announced Tuesday that Vedrine will visit
Tehran on Aug. 22-23, the first visit to the Islamic Republic by a
French foreign minister since 1991.

Spy dismissed after he claimed top officials involved in smuggling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A high-ranking intelligence officer
who accused top officials of being involved in smuggling,
complicity with criminals and spying has been dismissed, media
reported Saturday.
	   Gen. Corneliu Grigoras was fired after publication of a
wide-ranging interview Friday in which he said that allegations
about top-level wrongdoing by former Foreign Minister Adrian
Severin were ``99.9 percent true.''
	   Severin was removed from his post early this year after he
failed to produce evidence to substantiate his accusations.
	   Grigoras also said officials were well informed about a recent
cigarette smuggling case worth over dlrs 1 million even though they
pretended not to be.
	   He also said the Romanian Foreign Ministry knew about forged
passports issued by its Bonn embassy long before action was taken.
He claimed an important political person was a foreign spy chief
and a foreign businessman close to the former government was an
arms dealer.
	   Grigoras was fired for ``overstepping ... his duties,'' the news
agency Mediafax reported, quoting foreign intelligence executives.
	   Romanians are obsessed with spyig and disinformation. The
methods of the former Communist Securitate secret police still
linger in the country, nine years after Communism ended.
	   At a news conference Friday, Grigoras made an attempt to
backtrack but was dismissed hours later.

	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) _ Fidel Castro laid flowers at a
memorial honoring Barbadians' emancipation from slavery 160 years
ago and vowed Saturday to continue the liberation struggle for his
Caribbean neighbors.
	   ``Barbados and the Caribbean may trust Cuba the way a tree
trusts its own roots,'' Castro declared after leading a 1,000-yard
(915 meter) public procession to a statue of Bussa, leader of a
bloody 1816 slave revolt on the Caribbean island.
	   Peach-colored rays of dawn shone from behind clouds on the
horizon as stilt-walkers, men and women carrying hibiscus flowers
and ginger lilies and children dressed in brightly colored
traditional scarves and dresses accompanied Castro and Barbadian
Prime Minister Owen Arthur to the statue. Some swayed to a gentle
rhythm laid down by a half-dozen bandsmen playing drums and flute.
	   Arthur dedicated this year's Barbados Emancipation Day holiday
to the pan-African liberation struggle and thanked Castro for
Cuba's support in overthrowing apartheid in South Africa.
	   Aside from African blood, ``The only blood that was shed for the
liberation of Africa was Cuban blood,'' Arthur said to applause
from about 2,000 people.
	   Castro said that struggle continues _ especially in the former
European slave colonies of the Caribbean, whose livelihood is
threatened by such actions as a U.S. challenge in the World Trade
Organization to European incentives for bananas, a lifeline for
many Caribbean nations.
	   ``We believe it to be extremely unfair and selfish that through
the World Trade Organization, the Caribbean countries will be
deprived of their modest quotas in the banana market, just to
please the insatiable appetite of three or four powerful American
transnationals,'' he said to cheers.
	   Later Saturday, Castro planned to dedicate a memorial to the
1976 bombing of a Cuban airliner here that killed 73 people. The
attack was blamed on anti-Castro activists.
	   Many Barbadians were elated that Castro joined the Emancipation
Day ceremony. A few, however, questions its propriety, noting that
political dissidents face persecution in Cuba.
	   ``What we stand for is 180 degrees from what Fidel Castro stands
for,'' said Sally Cools, a doctor and former Barbados radio
talk-show host. ``I'm all for trading with Cuba, but not for wining
and dining Fidel Castro.''
	   Such remarks contrasted sharply with the enthusiasm Castro
generated in Jamaica, where his boisterous rallies captured the
tone of Cuba's recent reconciliation with Caribbean nations.
	   Several Caribbean heads of state have traveled to Havana over
the past 18 months and many have joined Castro in his diplomatic
offensive against the tough U.S. stance on Cuba.
	   On Sunday, Castro was to proceed to Grenada, the third and last
stop of his Caribbean tour. Jamaica, Barbados and Grenada all once
shunned the communist leader but now are leading a campaign to
soften the U.S. position on Cuba.
	   Little fanfare accompanied Castro's visit here, as most
``Bajans'' focused on Cropover, Barbados' rowdy version of
Carnival. Banners strung up on Bridgetown lampposts advertised
Calypso band competitions such as the Pic-O-De-Crop finals at the
national stadium and Banks beer.

Angolan military denies forced recruitment as UN envoy begins

mission to avert civil war

background reports of UNITA forced recruitment in 9th graf; SUBS to
conform

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The Angolan armed forces on Saturday
denied U.N. allegations that they have begun a forced recruitment
drive in response to the country's apparent slide back into civil
war.
	   The denial, issued in a joint statement by the army and police,
came on the first day of an emergency visit by U.N. special envoy
Lakhdar Brahimi.
	   Brahimi arrived in Luanda Friday evening in the midst of
escalating tension between the government and the former rebel
movement UNITA.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan's special representative was due on
Saturday to confer with diplomats from the three observer states,
or ``troika'' _ the United States, Portugal and Russia _ as well as
members of the U.N. mission in Angola.
	   Brahimi was expected to meet President Jose Eduardo dos Santos
on Monday and UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi on Tuesday.
	   He was to urge the two sides to comply with the U.N.-brokered
1994 peace accord which sealed a tenuous end to their devastating
two-decade civil war.
	   Saturday's armed forces' statement denied reports by the U.N.
mission in Luanda on July 23 that the government army had been
forcibly recruiting young males.
	   The army and police statement said the military already has the
capacity to respond to any emergency war situation.
	   Last week the New York-based group Human Rights Watch announced
in neighboring Zambia that refugees from Angola had denounced UNITA
for kidnapping young people into the rebel forces.
	   Implementation of the 1994 peace deal is running far behind
schedule, bogged down in mutual distrust and a crossfire of
accusations.
	   The government maintains that UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola _ has not
fully demobilized its 70,000-strong guerrilla army.
	   It claims the group massacred more than 100 civilians in a
remote northeastern village last week. A U.N. investigation was
unable to establish the identity of the perpetrators.
	   Brahimi was also due to leave Wednesday for a tour of
neighboring nations whose leaders are close to either Dos Santos or
Savimbi. Details of his itinerary were not available.
	   The top official was to make recommendations about the future
U.N. presence in Angola, including whether to replace Alioune
Blondin Beye _ the special U.N. representative to Angola who
perished in an air crash in the Ivory Coast on June 26th. The U.N.
mandate ends Aug. 15.

Sydney braces for another week of boiling drinking water to kill
</HEADLINE>
parasites
 &UR; Eds: AMs; RECASTS
 &UR; By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Sydney's 3.7 million people must boil
drinking water for another week before dangerous bacterial
parasites are flushed out of the city system, health officials said
Saturday.
	   The anger of residents also reached the boiling point, with the
Sydney Morning Herald asking in its front-page headline, ``Is this
the best we can do?'' over a photo of bottled water.
	   Outraged residents pelted a Sydney Water repair crew fixing
broken pipes with stones Friday, the Australian Services Union
said. No one was hurt.
	   Law firms are advertising for clients to launch a class action
lawsuit against Sydney Water for the cost of buying bottled water,
boiling drinking water and any illnesses that might ensue.
	   The outbreak of the parasites giardia and cryptosporidium
announced in mid-week is a major embarrassment for the city that
will host the Summer Olympics just two years from now.
	   ``Having gone to the trouble of winning the Olympics, the very
least a state government could do is make sure that the water is
not poisonous,'' said federal Sports Minister Andrew Thompson.
	   A ray of hope broke though Saturday when state Urban Affairs
Minister Craig Knowles announced that water samples from the
Prospect Water plant that had spread the parasites were testing
clean.
	   If that holds up, he said, some neighborhoods might be told they
could resume using tap water as soon as Sunday.
	   The downside, added Chief Health Department officer Dr. Andrew
Wilson, is that it will take eight days for the clean water to
flush out the entire city system.
	   Fire hydrants and water mains were opened in neighborhoods
throughout the city to speed the process of purging the city water
system.
	   Another potential problem is that the incubation period for
infection is about seven days, Wilson said, so health officials
will be watching for signs of an outbreak next week.
	   So far hospitals and clinics have not reported any illness, he
said.
	   Giardia, normally spread through human or animal feces, can
cause diarrhea and other gastrointestinal problems. Cryptosporidium
is spread in a similar way. It causes flu-like symptoms and can
kill people with weak immune systems, including the very young and
the elderly.
	   Cryptosporidium got into the water supply of Milwaukee, Wis., in
1993, killing about 100 people. More than 400,000 others were
sickened.
	   Before the breakdown, Sydney had taken pride in its water, which
often won or ranked high in international taste tests when compared
with premium bottled waters.
	   Sydney Water last year ran an ad campaign with prominent
Australian Olympic athletes swigging glasses of water, and
proclaiming it ``good enough to bottle.''
	   That reputation is in tatters now.
	   ``It's going to take a very long time for Sydney Water to
restore people's faith, they won't be able to tell people their
water is good enough to bottle any more,'' said Diane Morgan,
managing director of Da Vinci marking consultants.
	   In a slap at Sydney Water, Knowles said the government will not
take its word on whether the water is safe, and instead appointed
an independent committee of microbiologists.
	   An independent inquiry set up by the government has also begun
examining why only southern Sydney residents were warned about the
contamination on Thursday, even though the filtration plant at
fault served all of Sydney.
	   With law firms soliciting clients for a class action suit
against Sydney Water, one firm _ Slater and Gordon _ said the
agency would likely have to pay out tens of millions of dollars in
claims for the disruption.
	   The cause of the contamination is unclear. Officials said animal
carcasses _ dogs and foxes _ were found either in or near an open
canal leading to the filtration plant that distributes water
citywide. But it has not been shown that the animal remains were
the source of the polluted water.
	   Sydney Water Managing Director Chris Pollett has said the
contamination may have come from run-off that already had been
contaminated with parasites.
	   Giardia and cryptosporidium are a problem in many cities around
the world that have aging filtration systems and pipes that leak,
sometimes admitting sewage.

IMF will support Bulgaria's transition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VESELIN TOSHKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund will lend
Bulgaria dlrs 800 million over the next three years, an IMF
official announced Saturday.
	   Speaking at a news conference at the end of her two-week mission
to Bulgaria, Anne McGuirk said the parameters of a three-year
agreement between Bulgaria and the IMF had been approved.
	   McGuirk will take the draft agreement to Washington for final
approval by the IMF. The signing is expected in September.
	   ``The financial gap for the three-year period will be dlrs 1.6
billion and the arrangement will cover approximately half of that
amount,'' McGuirk said. She added that the rest was expected to be
covered by other international financial institutions.
	   Bulgaria's current relative financial stability is due to a
currency board established to prevent the central bank from
printing money to cover deficits.
	   According to Finance Minister Muravei Radev, inflation in 1998
will not exceed 9 percent, compared to 16.4 percent forecast
earlier by the government.
	   In 1997, inflation soared to 578.6 percent, primarily due to the
deep economic and political crisis that gripped the country in the
first months of the year.
	   Radev predicted that the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) would grow
between 4.5 percent and 5 percent annually over the next three
years.
	   He also promised that average salaries, now approximately dlrs
100, will increase by 20 percent per year.
	   But the IMF mission leader stressed that substantial progress in
the structural reform was required to make the transition process
irreversible. She called also for acceleration and more
transparency of the process of turning state enterprises into
privately run companies.
	   Although the reformist government of Premier Ivan Kostov has
achieved financial stability, it still has to overcome the slow
pace of privatization and the lack of substantial foreign
investment.

Iraqi Communist Party leader tours US for support to oust Saddam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The leader of the Iraqi Communist Party has
begun a tour of American cities to seek support for efforts to
topple President Saddam Hussein, his party said Saturday.
	   Hamid Majid Moussa arrived in the United States on July 17 and
has been meeting Iraqi communities in several states ``to discuss
ways of ending the dictatorship,'' the party said in a statement
faxed to the Associated Press.
	   The visit, the first by a leader of the Iraqi Communist Party to
the United States, follows reports that U.S. President Bill Clinton
has asked Congress to approve the funding of covert operations
against Saddam.
	   The U.S. has also developed a program to enlist the assistance
of the Iraqi opposition in preparing the documentation required to
indict Saddam Hussein as a war criminal.
	   It is not clear if Moussa will meet U.S officials during his
trip.
	   The Communist Party spokesman in London, Sobhi al-Jumaili, told
The Associated Press that Moussa did not have an appointment to see
Clinton administration officials at this stage, but he would be
seeing American activists and researchers of U.S. think tanks in
Washington.
	   The Clinton administration last month invited the leaders of the
two rival Kurdish factions in northern Iraq to visit Washington for
talks on the situation in Iraq.
	   Baghdad has accused Washington and London of interfering in its
internal affairs through their attempts to bring about change in
Iraq.
	   The United States and Britain have led the fight in the U.N.
Security Council to maintain the sanctions imposed after Iraq's
1990 invasion of Kuwait until Iraq has eliminated its weapons of
mass destruction.

Iran bans pro-democracy newspaper hours after editor assaulted
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with authorities banning
pro-democracy newspaper; No pickup; UPDATES overline. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's hard-line clergy banned a
pro-democracy newspaper Saturday, the official news agency
reported, hours after the daily's editor said he was assaulted and
threatened with death by Islamic militants.
	   The Tous daily is the latest target in the power struggle
between moderate President Mohammad Khatami, who favors a freer
press, and conservative clergymen who want to maintain strict
control over information.
	   A branch of the Tehran Justice Department issued the ban order
on Tous with immediate effect, the Islamic Republic News Agency
said.
	   The branch ``mentioned several articles of the press law for the
ruling,'' IRNA said, giving no details.
	   Tous editors were not immediately available for comment.
	   The popular newspaper, named after a northeastern town and known
for its outspoken views on Iranian politics, resumed publishing
only last week after skirting an earlier ban.
	   Earlier Saturday, Tous editor Mahmoud Shams said about 30 youths
demonstrating on the street confronted him when he arrived for
work.
	   Someone punched him in the face, but before the situation could
get worse his colleagues whisked him away in a car, Shams said. He
returned after the demonstrators left. Witnesses and staff members
confirmed the account.
	   Shams said his attackers ``told me ... `We are here to kill
you.'''
	   Later, the protesters said they were not affiliated with any
group. But the hard-line clergy has the support of many radical
Islamic groups, which in the past have often broken up
pro-democracy demonstrations and attacked offices of liberal
newspapers.
	   Two Associated Press reporters who arrived later were punched,
kicked and chased away by the protesters. Anwar Faruqi, a Pakistani
citizen, suffered cuts on his hands and legs, and Afshin Valinejad,
an Iranian, was kicked in the groin.
	   The protesters said they had not beaten any journalists.

	   HOCKENHEIM, Germany (AP) _ If not Michael Schumacher, then
Mercedes. The German Grand Prix on Sunday is likely to have a
German winner, even if it's not the home crowd's favorite Formula
One driver.
	   While Schumacher struggled Saturday in his Ferrari, Mika
Hakkinen in a McLaren car powered by a Mercedes engine charged to
his seventh pole positions of the season and will start Sunday's
45-lap race from the front row.
	   ``I came to Hockenheim to win and that's what I will be trying
to do,'' Hakkinen said.
	   Schumacher only managed ninth and his chances of cutting
Hakkinen's eight-point lead in the drivers' standings look slim.
	   While the crowd, expected to reach 150,000, will be hoping for a
miracle from Schumacher, it may have to settle for the second best
_ a victory by a German engine.
	   Mercedes has not won in Germany since 1954. In 1955, the factory
quit Formula One racing after a crash involving one of its cars
killed more than 80 people in Le Mans, France. Mercedes returned to
car racing 30 years later, but a Formula One victory on its home
soil has not come yet.
	   This season, the McLaren-Mercedes cars have been dominating the
Formula One season, winning six of 10 races so far _ Hakkinen
taking five of them.
	   The McLarens have held the pole in all but one of the races.
	   Hakkinen's teammate David Coulthard placed second in qualifying
to put the two McLarens in the front row.
	   Schumacher, Hakkinen's closest rival in the battle for the World
Championship, had a tough time.
	   In the morning practice session, Schumacher lost 45 minutes
after a spin in a curve. He then suffered an engine failure in the
second session. In the afternoon's one-hour qualifying, Schumacher
was never in contention.
	   ``It is definitely the wrong time and the wrong place to have my
worst qualifying of the season,'' said Schumacher, a two-time
champion before joining Ferrari.
	   And for the first time this season, Schumacher was beaten by his
Ferrari teammate, Eddie Irvine, in the qualifying. Irvine was
sixth.
	   ``I hope the crowd is not too disappointed as my brother had a
good session. We have to work very hard for tomorrow to improve the
car,'' said Schumacher, winner of four races this season.
	   ``It is possible to overtake here, it is a long race and
anything can happen,'' he said.
	   One factor in Schumacher's favor could be the weather. Showers
are forecast for Sunday and Schumacher is a master of dare-devil
driving in wet conditions.
	   Hakkinen said he wasn't worried about possible rain.
	   ``Tomorrow is tomorrow. We will just have to find the best
solution and look for a good balance. We are extremely competitive
in the wet.''
	   Hakkinen said the high-speed circuit, where drivers routinely
top speeds of 300 kph (180 mph), could prove treacherous in the
rain.
	   ``It can be dangerous. We are going at such high speed that
aquaplaning could be a big problem out there if it rains heavily,''
Hakkinen said.
	   Hakkinen clocked a time of one minute, 41.838 seconds on the
6.8-kilometer (4.2-mile) circuit.
	   Coulthard was .509 seconds behind, while defending champion
Jacques Villeneuve was .527 seconds slower in his Williams to place
third, equaling his best qualifying performance this year.
	   ``We were fighting all the way and even took McLaren at one
point,'' Villeneuve said.
	   ``It's going to be very difficult to beat Mika and David, but we
are competitive enough to fight,'' said the Canadian, who still has
to make the top three in a race this season.
	   Schumacher's younger brother, Ralf, completed the second row on
the starting grid by posting the fourth fastest time in his Jordan.
	   He was followed by former champion Damon Hill, the best showing
by Jordan in qualifying this season.
	   ``To see both cars right up there in the top six, well in touch
with the class of the field is great,'' Hill said.
	   ``Part of me had hoped for more, but I think we have to be
pleased with what we got,'' he said.
	   Brazilian Ricardo Rosset was unable to take part in qualifying
after a heavy crash in practice, while Tyrrell teammate Toranosuke
Takagi of Japan drove into a tire barrier.
	   Rosset, who was not seriously injured, will not be allowed to
race Sunday.

Palestinian security chief slams Hamas in interview
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IMAD MUSA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ For the second time in a week, a top
Palestinian security official has slammed Hamas, suggesting the
possibility of a new crackdown on the militant Islamic movement.
	   Mohammed Dahlan, head of Preventive Security in the Gaza Strip,
was quoted as saying in the London-based Arabic magazine al-Wasat
that Hamas was ``an obstacle to establishing the Palestinian
Authority's political achievements.''
	   Hamas, or the Islamic Resistance Movement, is the main
opposition to Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority. Hamas opposes
the Oslo peace accords between the Palestinians and Israel and has
claimed responsibility for suicide bomb attacks that have killed
scores of Israelis in recent years.
	   In the interview, published Saturday in the Ramallah-based
newspaper al-Ayyam, a day before it was to appear in the London
paper, Dahlan said Hamas ``presents itself not as an opposition
group but as an alternative'' to the Palestinian Authority.
	   Dahlan blamed Hamas for helping bring Israel's hard-line Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to power by carrying out a series of
suicide bombings before the May 1996 Israeli elections.
	   For most of Netanyahu's term, there have not been face-to-face
negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians, so ``Hamas is
destroying the Palestinian Authority and not just limiting it,''
Dahlan said.
	   Hamas spokesman Mahmoud Zahar said the group would have no
immediate response.
	   Dahlan also criticized Hamas founder and spiritual leader Sheik
Ahmed Yassin, who recently returned to Gaza from a three-month
fundraising tour of Arab states. Yassin has repeatedly criticized
Arafat's policies and advocated a return to armed struggle.
	   ``The tour of Sheik Yassin was aimed at pressuring the
Palestinian Authority to make concessions,'' Dahlan said.
	   The security chief said that there was a ``common ground''
between the Palestinian Authority and Hamas leaders inside the
Palestinian areas, but that there was ``a tremendous gap'' with
Hamas leaders in other countries, who he said were ``far from
reality.''
	   Dahlan's counterpart in the West Bank, Jibril Rajoub, said last
week that Hamas would not be allowed to become too powerful.
	   ``I didn't take part in the national struggle for 18 years ...
to see Sheik Ahmed Yassin leading the Palestinian people,'' Rajoub
said.

	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ The Bahrain Telecommunication Co. said
Saturday it has made a net profit of 20 million dinars (dlrs 53
million) in the first half of this year, representing a 25 percent
rise over gains in the same period last year.
	   The company said in a press release that its gross revenue for
the first half of 1998 also rose 17 percent to 62 million dinars
(dlrs 164 million) from 53.2 million dinars (dlrs 141 million)
during the same period last year.
	   The company, better known as Batelco, did not comment on the
rise in net profit but attributed the increase in revenue to a
growth in demand for its services, particularly the mobile
telephone and Internet services.
	   On Saturday, the company announced reduction on tariffs up to to
54 percent on international calls to some 174 destinations
worldwide.
	   The company recorded a net profit of 32.4 million dinars (dlrs
86 million) last year, which was the company's best performance
since its establishment in 1981.
	   Batelco, which has a monopoly, is 20 percent owned by Britain's
Cable and Wireless and 36 percent by the government. The remaining
shares are listed on the Bahrain Stock Exchange.
 &UR; ___
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The price index of the Kuwait Stock Exchange
closed at 2,142.8 points at the end of July, up 17.5 points, or
0.82 percent, from the closing of the previous month, the National
Investments Co. said Saturday.
	   In a monthly report, the company said trading was activated by
Parliament's nod to a government proposal for rescheduling billions
of dinars in bad debts, as well as good mid-year results of listed
companies.
	   Some 1.30 billion shares changed hands in July, 47.27 percent
higher than those traded in June. The value of these stocks also
rose by 24.98 percent reaching 302.79 million dinars (dlrs 989.50
million), the report said.
	   The exchange lists 75 companies, but trading is limited to
nationals and citizens of other Arab countries in the Gulf.
 &UR; ___
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The Egyptian and Jordanian electricity
systems will integrate in October, official said Saturday.
	   The linkage is expected to save the two countries at least 5
million dollars a year, and the project will eventually link the
grids of Syria, Iraq and Turkey, a process expected to be completed
by year 2002.
	   Jordan's Energy Minister Mohammed Saleh Hourani will meet later
with his Egyptian counterpart, Mohammed Abaza, to finalize the
final steps for the linking of the power grids, the state-run Petra
News Agency said.
	   The Egyptian-Jordanian project was to have been inaugurated last
December but was postponed due to the collapse of a massive coral
reef, which broke an underwater cable in the Red Sea.
	   A 600-meter (1,980-feet) section of the 13-kilometers (8 miles)
long, 400-kilovolt cable cable was replaced at a cost of about dlrs
72 million, an official told The Associated Press on condition of
anonymity.
	   The project is being partially financed by the Arab Fund for
Social and Economic Development.
 &UR; ___
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan and Algeria agreed on cooperation in
pharmaceutical production, medical services and exchange of medical
expertise, the health ministry said Saturday.
	   The agreement was concluded following talks in Algeria between
Health Minister Ashraf Kurdi and his Algerian counterpart there, a
ministry statement said.
	   The two sides called for further integration of the
Jordanian-Algerian pharmaceutical industry through joint ventures,
and sharing projects, and increased investments by the private and
public sectors, the statement said.
	   The Algerian side renewed an offer to provide Jordan's
pharmaceutical companies with raw material for the manufacture of
antibiotics.
	   Algerian officials requested an increase in the number of air
flights between the two countries to facilitate the transfer of
Algerian patients to Jordan, the statement said.
 &UR; ___
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United States has blocked some 80
contracts from the second and third phases of Iraq's oil-for-food
deal with the United Nations, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz said in remarks published Saturday.
	   Aziz said the contracts have been help up ``with no
justification'' by Washington. Iraq had signed the contracts with
foreign firms to purchase food, medicine and spare parts for its
ailing electricity network.
	   The second phase of the U.N. program ended in January 1998 and
the third finished on June 3. Under the program, Iraq is allowed to
bypass sanctions imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait to sell
limited amounts of oil. The proceeds have to be spent on
humanitarian goods, with the contracts being approved by the U.N.
sanctions committee in New York.
	   The United States has frequently used its representation on the
committee to veto contracts for goods it fears may be used for
military purposes.
	   Aziz made the remarks in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan that was quoted in Iraqi newspapers.
	   ``This stand exposes the American lies and fabrications and
shows ... how Washington tries to employ everything at its disposal
to prevent the easing of the Iraqi people's hardship,'' Aziz said.
	   Iraq has previously accused Washington of obstructing dozens of
contracts in the present phase of the oil program, which gives
Baghdad the right to sell dlrs 5.2 billion worth of oil.

New Swiss Guards commander takes over Vatican army
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ The new commander of the pope's Swiss Guards
took over on Saturday, replacing the man slain in May by a
disgruntled subordinate in an outburst of violence that stunned the
tightly knit Vatican community.
	   Pius Segmueller, a Swiss army colonel, took command of the
100-strong papal army with little fanfare. The interim commander
had already left and Segmueller and his deputy, Elmar Mader, have
been in Rome for several weeks getting to know their troops.
	   After returning to Switzerland earlier this week, interim
commander Ronald Buchs said morale within the Vatican security
force had largely been restored.
	   It was shattered by the May 4 murder-suicide that took the life
of the previous commander, Alois Estermann. A young guardsman,
Cedric Tornay, shot Estermann and Estermann's wife to death in
their Vatican apartment, then turned his gun on himself.
	   The Vatican said Tornay was bitter because Estermann reprimanded
him and did not award him a medal.
	   Segmueller, 46, was with the Swiss army's Bern-based Hospital
Regiment 12 until his appointment as commander of the papal army.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A Bosnian Serb genocide suspect on
trial for alleged atrocities against Muslims and Croats at three
infamous prison camps died of a heart attack in his cell Saturday.
	   The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal said Milan Kovacevic, 57, had
been suffering from chronic health problems and that his death in a
holding cell outside The Hague was of natural causes.
	   Tribunal spokesman Christian Chartier said Kovacevic died
between 9 and 9:30 a.m. Saturday, and that his body had been taken
to a mortuary.

faced a maximum life sentence. He was arrested by NATO forces last
summer in Prijedor.

IMF official discusses Russian loan package in Moscow

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A top envoy from the International Monetary Fund
wound up two days of talks with economic policy makers in Moscow on
Saturday, the day when the government's new stabilization program
took effect with the introduction of several new tax laws.
	   The visit by IMF deputy managing director Stanley Fischer less
than three weeks after an IMF-led, dlrs 22.6 billion bailout was
announced signaled the international financial community's
determination to keep up the pressure on Russia's government to
keep its promises.
	   Fischer met with Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko on Friday and
with Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov and Deputy Prime Minister
Anatoly Chubais, who is Russia's liaison with international lending
organizations, on Saturday.
	   Kiriyenko was scheduled to brief President Boris Yeltsin on
Saturday evening about his talks with Chechen President Aslan
Maskhadov and the economic situation in the country.
	   Kiriyenko said the talks would focus mainly on the ``economic
situation, the fulfillment of budget and social welfare
obligations,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The package of laws and decrees that went into effect on
Saturday, including new laws on customs rates and value-added
taxes, is expected to bring more than 105 billion rubles (dlrs 17
billion) into government coffers next year, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported Saturday.
	   In addition to raising tax revenues _ a chronic uphill battle
for the government _ the new economic program is intended to
persuade international lenders that Russia is serious about
grappling with its constant economic crises. The government was
forced to introduce by decree some reforms that the
Communist-dominated parliament refused to pass.
	   Fischer and Kiriyenko agreed Friday that the Russian
government's austerity program should lead to stability, the
government's press service said.
	   Russian tax chief Boris Fyodorov said Friday that the government
had collected dlrs 80.6 million more in July taxes than the dlrs
1.8 billion it collected in June. It expects to collect dlrs 1.9
billion in August, he said.
	   The government also said the natural gas monopoly Gazprom,
Russia's largest company and one of its biggest tax-dodgers, had
paid its July tax bill of 2.5 billion rubles (dlrs 40 million).
	   However, the government has not yet paid 600 million rubles
(dlrs 96.7 million) its agencies owe the gas monopoly for last
month, Gazprom head Rem Vyakhirev said Saturday, according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency.

Flash floods in Yemen kill eight people
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Flash floods have killed eight people in
western Yemen, an official said Saturday.
	   The eight people were drowned when floods engulfed their vehicle
as it was crossing a valley in the Red Sea province of al-Hudaydah,
140 miles (225 kilometers) west of San`a, said the official,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Only the driver survived, said the official. Three of the
victims' bodies have not yet been retrieved.
	   The floods were caused by heavy rains on Thursday and Friday,
said the official.
	   In 1996, about 200 people died in floods that swept through
several Yemeni provinces, causing damage estimated at dlrs 1.2
billion.

Trade booms between former war foes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Former wartime enemies Croatia and
Yugoslavia have registered a trade boom in the first half of 1998,
according to national foreign trade results released Saturday.
	   The two countries, who fought a bloody war of secession in 1991,
increased mutual trade as much as 160 times compared with the same
time period last year. No figures were given.
	   Although encouraging for both markets, the sharp increase also
confirmed a disturbingly widening foreign trade deficit for
Croatia, which is finding it hard to compete internationally with
an overvalued currency.
	   Yugoslavia profited in the exchange with a surplus of 11.76
million kuna (dlrs 1.87 million), despite its position as an
economic and political pariah for its part in the ongoing Balkan
conflicts.
	   It exported goods worth 51.67 million kuna (dlrs 8.2 million) to
its western neighbor and imported goods worth 39.9 million kuna,
according to the State Bureau of Statistics.
	   Although overall Croatia's exports rose by eight percent, its
imports also rose by over eight percent. In July, the country
exported dlrs 2.2 billion kuna (dlrs 353 million) but imported for
more than double that sum _ 4.8 billion kuna (dlrs 765 million).
	   Croatia and Yugoslavia established diplomatic relations in
August 1996 and have since signed several normalization accords
ranging from traffic, trade and social welfare.
	   President Franjo Tudjman has often cited stable relations with
Yugoslavia as a key to stability in the volatile Balkan region.

BayStars beat Swallows 9-2
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Robert Rose hit a solo homer in the bottom of the
second inning Saturday to help power the Central League-leading
Yokohama BayStars past the Yakult Swallows 9-2.
	   BayStars' starter Hiroki Nomura gave up seven hits, struck out
six and walked one in seven-plus innings to pick up the win.
Nomura, who leads the league with 10 victories, also drove in two
runs with a tie-breaking single in the second.
	   Rose, formerly of the California Angels, has 11 homers this
season.
	   At Hiroshima, Kazuki Inoue drove in a total of four runs,
including a three run homer in the top of the first inning, to give
the Chunichi Dragons a 5-2 victory over the Hiroshima Toyo Carp.
	   The homer was Inoue's seventh this season.
	   At Koshien, Takayui Shimizu batted in a tie-breaking solo in the
top of the fifth inning as the Yomiuri Giants edged the Hanshin
Tigers 3-1.
	   Giants' starter Masumi Kuwata (7-4) completed the game, allowing
only four hits, striking out three and walking two.
	   Earlier Saturday, the Giants announced that the team has
suspended its ace pitcher Balvino Galves for the rest of the season
after throwing a ball at an umpire in Friday's game. Galvez,
formerly of the Texas Rangers, was also asked to leave Japan.
	   Galvez fired a ball at home plate umpire Atsushi Kittaka to
protest a call in the 6th inning.
	   In Pacific League action, Julio Franco hit a two-run homer in
the top of the first inning to give the Chiba Lotte Marines an
early lead in a 3-2 victory over the first-place Nippon Ham
Fighters.
	   Franco, formerly of the Milwaukee Brewers, now has 16 homers
this season.
	   Saturday's loss was the fourth in a row for the Fighters.
	   At Fukuoka, the Seibu Lions and Fukuoka Daiei Hawks ended up
with a 5-5 tie after league rules ended the game after 12 innings.
	   Luis Lopez, formerly of the Cleveland Indians, hit two homers
for the Hawks _ a three-run homer in the bottom of the eighth
inning, followed by a solo homer in the 11th.
	   At Osaka Dome, Takahisa Suzuki hit a tie-breaking two-run single
in the bottom of the eighth inning, lifting the Kintetsu Buffaloes
to a 5-4 victory over the Orix BlueWave.
	   Pinch hitter Takayuki Murakami drove in a run on a single
earlier in the inning.
	   The BlueWave's winning streak ended at four.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A Bosnian Serb genocide suspect
charged with atrocities against Muslims and Croats at three
infamous prison camps died of a heart attack in his cell Saturday.
	   The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal said Milan Kovacevic, 57, had
chronic health problems and that his death in a holding cell
outside The Hague was of natural causes.
	   Tribunal spokesman Christian Chartier said Kovacevic died
Saturday and his body had been taken to a mortuary.
	   Kovacevic was charged with genocide, war crimes and crimes
against humanity involving atrocities committed in northwest
Bosnia's Prijedor region in 1992.
	   Prosecutors accused Kovacevic of guiding a campaign of
atrocities against Bosnian Muslims and Croats, including the
establishment of three of the Bosnian war's most infamous prison
camps: Omarska, Keraterm and Trnopolje.
	   Hundreds of detainees were tortured and killed in the camps,
according to Kovacevic's indictment.
	   Kovacevic, a former anesthesiologist and Prijedor mayor, pleaded
innocent to all 15 charges. If convicted, he would have faced a
maximum life sentence. He was arrested by NATO forces last summer
in Prijedor.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A Bosnian Serb genocide suspect on
trial for alleged atrocities against Muslims and Croats at three
infamous prison camps he set up died Saturday of a heart attack in
his cell.
	   The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal said Milan Kovacevic, 57, had
suffered chronic health trouble and several strokes, and that his
death in a holding cell outside The Hague was of natural causes.
	   Tribunal spokesman Christian Chartier said Kovacevic died
between 9 and 9:30 a.m. Saturday, and that his body had been taken
to a mortuary. Chartier said arrangements to return his body to his
family in Bosnia would follow a routine investigation by Dutch
authorities.
	   Kovacevic was charged with genocide, war crimes and crimes
against humanity for alleged atrocities committed in northwest
Bosnia's Prijedor region in 1992. He had pleaded innocent to all 15
charges against him and would have faced a maximum life sentence if
convicted.
	   Kovacevic stood accused of overseeing a vicious campaign of
arrests, rapes, torture and slayings of non-Serbs.
	   Prosecutors said Kovacevic was among a group of municipal
officials who engineered a violent campaign to expel Bosnian
Muslims and Croats from Prijedor between April and December 1992.
	   They had accused Kovacevic of guiding the campaign of atrocities
and of establishing three of the Bosnian war's most infamous prison
camps: Omarska, Keraterm and Trnopolje.
	   Hundreds of detainees were tortured and killed in the Serb-run
camps, according to Kovacevic's indictment.
	   His trial had just begun on July 6 and was the U.N. court's
first dealing specifically with the crime of genocide.
	   In testimony last month, one Bosnian Muslim prosecution witness
detailed the brutality he endured at the Omarska camp, claiming he
was severely beaten with batons and metal rods because of his
religious beliefs.
	   There were so many dead bodies at Omarska that large trucks were
needed at times to remove them from the camp, prosecutor Brenda
Hollis alleged in her opening statements.
	   ``In Omarska, people saw corpses everyday ... killings were
routine in Keraterm,'' she said.
	   Kovacevic, a former anesthesiologist and Prijedor mayor, was
arrested by NATO forces last summer in Prijedor.
	   Although Kovacevic was the first to stand trial on genocide
charges, he is not the only suspect facing that charge. Among
others indicted for genocide are the tribunal's top two suspects,
former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his wartime
military commander, Ratko Mladic. Both remain at large.

Iwata retains lead in Japan soccer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: One name for Adilson is correct

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Brazilian Adilson scored and Naohiro Takahara
followed as Jubilo Iwata beat Urawa Reds 2-0 Saturday to retain its
lead in Japan's 18-club professional soccer league.
	   Iwata and Shimizu S-Pulse both are 11-4 with 33 points, only
three points ahead of Yokohama Marinos, Nagoya Grampus Eight,
Kashima Antlers and Verdy Kawasaki.
	   Iwata leads the league, though, because it has more goals than
Shimizu, a 2-0 winner over Yokohama Flugels on Saturday.
	   Two more rounds of competition remain in the first of the
league's two-stage season.
	   The second stage for the league, which is in its sixth season,
extends from Aug. 11 through Nov. 14.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A Bosnian Serb genocide suspect
charged with atrocities against Muslims and Croats at three
infamous prison camps he set up died Saturday of a heart attack in
his cell.

lower casualty toll &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Landslides triggered by heavy rains have
killed at least 32 people and injured 45 others in two Iranian
provinces, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported
Saturday.
	   The Natural Disaster Headquarters said it could confirm only 26
dead and 15 injured in Friday's landslides, but it expected the
casualties to rise.
	   The rescue operation is ``proceeding strongly,'' a spokesman for
the headquarters told The Associated Press.
	   The news agency reported that 30 people were killed in Masouleh
city in the northern province of Gilan and two people were killed
in the northeastern province of Ardebil.
	   More than 500 rescue workers were trying Saturday to retrieve
bodies buried in mud in Masouleh, the agency said.
	   Witnesses and policemen fear more than 100 people may be buried
in Masouleh, the report said.
	   The mud slides swept away cars and trucks and damaged a number
of homes along the Masouleh river, the agency reported.
	   In Ardebil, flash floods killed livestock and damaged orchards
and farms in 20 villages, the agency said.
	   Relief workers have rescued 700 stranded villagers.
	   In April, a landslide killed 55 people in a remote village in
central Iran.

Zambian, Zimbabwean presidents condemn UNITA
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ The presidents of two southern African
countries, Zambia and Zimbabwe, strongly condemned UNITA rebel
forces Saturday for derailing the peace process in neighboring
Angola.
	   Presidents Frederick Chiluba of Zambia and Robert Mugabe of
Zimbabwe said they feared a new civil war would engulf the entire
region.
	   ``The Angolan situation is worrying and of great concern to us
all,'' Mugabe said at a banquet in his honor in Lusaka.
	   The two leaders called for diplomatic efforts.
	   Mugabe said that leaders of the Southern African Development
Community had also asked for United Nations ``offensive''
intervention if war breaks out in the former Portuguese colony.
	   U.N. Angola envoy Lakhdar Brahimi was in Angola on Saturday to
confer with diplomats from the three observer states, or ``troika''
_ the United States, Portugal and Russia _ that helped formulate a
1994 peace accord that has never been fully implemented.
	   For decades Angola was a battlefield for the Cold War conflict,
with the United States supporting UNITA and socialist countries
supporting forces that won the 1992 elections.
	   UNITA has refused to accept the election results and take the
minority seats it garnered in the vote.
	   Zambia shares borders with eastern Angola and western Zimbabwe,
and has been receiving an upswing of refugees from the Angolan
conflict.

Zivadinovic becomes new national soccer team coach
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Milan Zivadinovic, former manager of
Red Star Belgrade and the Under-21 team, on Saturday became the new
coach of the Yugoslav national soccer team.
	   Zivadinovic, 53, replaces Slobodan Santrac, who resigned
following Yugoslavia's early exit from the World Cup this summer in
France.
	   Yugoslavia lost 2-1 to the Netherlands in the second round and
Santrac was bitterly criticized for his defensive tactics.
	   The job of the national team coach had been offered to former
Atletico Madrid manager, Radomir Antic, but he refused it,
preferring to stay in Spain and remain in club soccer.
	   Zivadinovic, who trained Red Star Belgrade in the early 1990s
and ended his playing career in 1975 in Germany's minor league, is
virtually unknown in international soccer.

Russian premier discusses Chechen economic troubles in semi-secret

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Meeting with Chechnya's embattled president, Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko declared Saturday that the Russian
government would ``do everything possible'' to support the region's
legally elected government.
	   However, no new agreements were struck at the meeting and
Kiriyenko stressed that the two sides should concentrate on
implementing the pledges already made.
	   Now, Kiriyenko said, ``we need peace in the Caucasus, stability
and unity, and the resolution of economic problems can facilitate
that.''
	   The two leaders discussed cooperation on transporting fuel and
on social policies, including pensions, employment, medical
services and children's needs, Russian news agencies reported.
	   Kiriyenko said that he and Maskhadov had discussed the
possibility of employing Chechnya residents in the so-called Black
Soil agricultural regions of Central Russia, and that he would sign
a decree on Saturday ensuring that up to 1,000 children living in
Chechnya would be able to vacation at Russian summer camps, the
Interfax news agency said.
	   The prime minister also broached the idea of setting up a
special economic zone in Chechnya, telling Interfax that ``it is
senseless to create the impression that the situation in Chechnya
is usual.''
	   The cease-fire and treaty that ended the 1994-1996 Chechen war
did not resolve the vital question of Chechnya's political status.
Chechnya runs its own affairs and considers itself independent, but
Moscow and the rest of the world treats it as part of Russia.
	   Violence and crime have continued to plague Chechnya and the
rest of the Caucasus region. Maskhadov _ who led Chechnya's war for
independence and was elected president 18 months ago _ has been
shaken by a fresh wave of violence in and around the republic,
including a July 23 attempt to assassinate him. Russia's special
envoy to Chechnya, Valentin Vlasov, was kidnapped on May 1.
	   Saturday's meeting near Nazran, the capital of the republic of
Ingushetia, was meant to shore up Maskhadov, a moderate who is
trying to control Chechnya's diverse and well-armed bands of
fighters. It fears that if he were to fall a more radical leader
could come to power.
	   ``The Republic of Chechnya has a legally elected government, a
legally elected president, and we will do everything possible to
support this government,'' Kiriyenko said after the meeting.
	   Chechen officials long have accused the Kremlin of failing to
fulfill its promises to rebuild the republic's war-battered
economy.
	   Maskhadov said that his meeting with Kiriyenko was encouraging.
	   ``For the last six months we have been on the edge, where we
wondered whether we should meet Moscow representatives at all,''
ITAR-Tass quoted him as saying. Now, he said, there is ``hope for
the resolution of the earlier agreements.''

<TEXT>
	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   Fragmented bands of clouds and showers moved westward across the
U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico during the night. However, most
of the showers were light and remained over water. Nevertheless,
one or two moved quickly over the metropolitan area of San Juan.
The winds were from the east at 5 to 10 mph.
	   The bands of clouds and showers mentioned before will continue
to move southwest across our area today and tonight. However, an
upper-level high pressure system north of Puerto Rico will inhibit
the rainfall activity. Expect showers and thunderstorms to
concentrate mainly across interior and west sections of Puerto Rico
during the afternoon. An upper-level low pressure system east of
the Leeward Islands will move west and will cause unstable
conditions over our area Sunday, thereby increasing the showers and
thunderstorms over our area.

during the night. At 5 a.m., Alex was located about 750 miles east
southeast of the U.S. Virgin Islands. Although Alex does not
represent a threat to the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico at

monitor this storm today and tonight as it continues its westward
track.

<TEXT>
	   TAKHMAU, Cambodia (AP) _ A former Khmer Rouge guerrilla believed
to have been responsible for the killings of three young Western
tourists in 1994 has been arrested after being lured to Cambodia's
capital by police.
	   The country's top leader, Hun Sen, announced details of the
arrest of Nuon Paet on Saturday after giving a briefing on the
matter to the ambassadors of Australia, Britain and France, the
homelands of the victims.
	   Nuon Paet headed a band of Khmer Rouge guerrillas who halted a
train going south from the capital and abducted three Western
travelers: David Wilson, 29, of Australia, Mark Slater, 28, of
Britain and Jean-Michel Braquet, 27, of France.
	   The guerrillas, holed up on rugged Vine Mountain in the southern
province of Kampot, held several months of protracted negotiations
with the government during which they asked for a large ransom for
their captives' release.
	   The negotiations apparently continued even after the men had
been executed, unbeknownst to the government. No ransom is known to
have been paid.
	   Hun Sen's account of Nuon Paet's arrest indicated that
authorities had lured the former guerrilla to the capital on the
pretense of a business deal. He said police had been working on the
case for a long time.
	   His account said that Nuon Paet and five bodyguards were stopped
in their car as they were driving from Phnom Penh's airport to the
capital city.
	   Hun Sen said Nuon Paet had most recently been in the western
province of Pailin on the Thai border, a one-time guerrilla
stronghold which is now ruled _ with a great degree of autonomy _
by a former high-ranking Khmer Rouge member who defected to the
government in 1996.
	   He said Nuon Paet was known to disguise himself in an army
uniform or as a trader, and was active in smuggling cars from
Thailand.
	   Dressed casually in light colored sport shirt, Nuon Paet looked
unhappy Saturday as he was taken first to a police station,
escorted by plainclothes officers, with his hands shackled behind
his back.
	   He was later moved to the capital's notorious T-3 prison, where
political offenders and other important prisoners are usually held.
	   In Canberra, Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said
the arrest was ``a welcome step in what has been a very long battle
to see Nuon Paet brought to justice.''
	   The case had caused considerable controversy, especially in
Australia, because it was believed that the Cambodian government
had mishandled the negotiations.
	   A parliamentary hearing was held in Canberra and a special
coroner's inquest in Melbourne to investigate why the men could not
be saved.
	   The Cambodian government was sharply criticized at the time of
the incident for first agreeing to pay a hefty ransom and then
shelling the kidnappers' base in order to try to spur defections
among Nuon Paet's men.
	   There has also been criticism that the government had been aware
of Nuon Paet's whereabouts for at least the past year but was
unwilling to apprehend him.
	   ``This isn't going to bring the hostages back, of course, the
tragedy is that they are dead, but if the families can have a full
understanding of the facts and what happened, I think that's a good
thing,'' said Tony Kevin, Australia's former ambassador to
Cambodia, who took up his posting just three days before the
hostages were taken.
	   ``I don't know how he came to be in Phnom Penh, I don't know how
he came to be arrested, but I think the most important thing now is
to regard this as a criminal justice matter,'' said Kevin, who
spoke to The Associated Press in Phnom Penh, where he served as an
observer for Cambodia's recent general election.
	   Hun Sen told reporters at his residence just outside the capital
that the trial should take place in Phnom Penh for security
reasons, and that he asked the ambassadors to send lawyers from
their countries on behalf of the victims.
	   ``The sooner the trial takes place the better,'' he said.
	   At least 10 foreigners kidnapped by Khmer Rouge guerrillas in
1994 and afterwards were subsequently killed by their captors. Only
one, American Melissa Himes, escaped unharmed.
	   The Khmer Rouge seized power in 1975 and killed as many as 2
million Cambodians in a bid to create a communist agrarian utopia.
It battled successive central governments after it was overthrown
in 1979 by a Vietnamese invasion.
	   In 1996, a huge wave of defections by the guerrillas crippled
the revolutionary movement and gave the country its best chance for
peace in decades. Only a few remnants remain after the government
took over their last major stronghold this past April.

In Europe's gay capital, the carefree paint the town pink

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ They're painting the town pink.
	   Clad in everything from wedding veils to leather G-strings, tens
of thousands of homosexuals from 66 countries were partying in the
cobblestoned streets of Amsterdam as the weeklong Gay Games got
under way Saturday.
	   But here in Europe's self-styled homosexual capital _ where gays
and lesbians can marry, are welcomed in the military and are close
to winning adoption rights _ not even the bare-chested men with
nipple jewelry rollerblading through town were drawing many stares.
	   ``We're used to it,'' Andre Bakker said with a shrug as he and
his wife, Florence, craned their necks for a glimpse of a dozen men
in Dutch milkmaid outfits dancing on a passing canal boat.
	   Founded in San Francisco in 1982 as a gay alternative to the
Olympics, the fifth quadrennial sports and cultural festival opened
amid clear signs that it has come of age.
	   Organizers said more than 200,000 visitors were in the Dutch
capital for the games, which run through Aug. 8 and will bring
together 15,000 competitors _ half again as many as the mainstream
Olympics.
	   No matter the scattered smirks over the fact that they'll be
handing out medals here for such ``sports' as ballroom dancing and
oil wrestling. Or that a small fringe group of hard-core
homosexuals were running their own ``Queer Do-It-Yourself Games''
featuring purse-tossing and a 200-meter dash in high heels.
	   The famously accepting Dutch, thousands of whom lined the
medieval canals Saturday to wildly cheer on a Gay Games parade of
boatloads of transvestites, have rolled out the pink carpet.
	   ``We've certainly made enormous gains in this country, and above
all in this city,'' said Rene Zuidervelt, the editor of Gay News
magazine.
	   ``It's not like that in other countries where homosexuals are
oppressed. The Romanians and the Zimbabweans who compete here can
get a feeling of solidarity.''
	   Gays and lesbians have been progressively integrated into Dutch
culture over the past two decades. Their latest landmark was the
legalization this year of civil marriage by lawmakers now leaning
toward granting homosexuals the right to adopt children.
	   Even the Amsterdam police, who put several hundred extra
officers on the streets for the Games, took out almost apologetic
ads in the national dailies reassuring that ``some of these police
officers are part of a gay and lesbian network within the police
force.''
	   Fifty thousand people, straight and gay alike, were packing a
soccer stadium on the outskirts of Amsterdam for the Gay Games
opening ceremonies under the theme ``Friendship Through Culture and
Sport.''
	   The main event was a concert by Dana International, the Israeli
transsexual pop star who gained notoriety and angered orthodox
leaders at home for winning May's Eurovision song contest.
	   Even so, the 1998 Gay Games aren't without controversy. On
Saturday, the European Gay and Lesbian Sports Federation called on
athletes to wear masks in protest of an International Skating Union
decision banning its members from future competitions if they
compete in Amsterdam.
	   Critics accused the ISU, skating's world governing body, of
homophobia. ISU officials have denied that, saying it was simply an
enforcement of longstanding rules forbidding participation in
unsanctioned and unofficial competitions.
	   None of that, though, came even close to stopping the Games from
going on.
	   ``This is certainly adding to our cultural experience,'' Bill
Mayer of Greensboro, North Carolina, said with a grin as he and his
wife, Kathy, watched two gay men in clingy black dresses and pumps
walk past.
	   The Amsterdam Gay Games are the first to be held in Europe. New
York City was the site of the last Games in 1994; Sydney,
Australia, site of the Summer Olympics in 2000, will have the first
southern hemisphere Gay Games in 2002.

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Landslides triggered by heavy rains have
killed at least 32 people and injured 45 others in two Iranian
provinces, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported
Saturday.
	   The Natural Disaster Headquarters said it could confirm only 26
dead and 15 injured in Friday's landslides, but it expected the
casualties to rise.
	   The rescue operation is ``proceeding strongly,'' a spokesman for
the headquarters told The Associated Press.
	   The news agency reported that 30 people were killed in the city
of Masouleh in the northern province of Gilan and two people were
killed in the northeastern province of Ardebil.
	   More than 500 rescue workers were trying Saturday to retrieve
bodies buried in mud in Masouleh, the agency said.
	   Witnesses and policemen fear more than 100 people may be buried
in Masouleh, the report said.
	   The mud slides swept away cars and trucks and damaged a number
of homes along the Masouleh river, the agency reported.
	   In Ardebil, flash floods killed livestock and damaged orchards
and farms in 20 villages, the agency said.
	   Relief workers have rescued 700 stranded villagers.
	   In April, a landslide killed 55 people in a remote village in
central Iran.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Look for the so-called ``Americans from
Europe'' to win this star-less world championship.
	   That means Yugoslavia.
	   Take away the NBA _ as the lockout has done _ and Yugoslavia
stands just a little taller than a field of near-equals, which
includes host country Greece, Lithuania, Russia, Australia, Italy,
Spain and the United States.
	   ``We have faced many difficulties,'' said Zeljko Obradovic, the
highly successful Yugoslav coach who has won European club titles
with three different clubs. ``Yet I have faith in this team and I
think we're going to make it.''
	   Yugoslavia is without its best two players _ the NBA's Vlade
Divac and injured former NBAer Predrag Danilovic _ and hobbled
playmaker Aleksandar Djordjeciv has played sparingly.
	   Still, Yugoslavia was one of four teams to go 3-0 in the first
round ended Friday _ joined by Greece, Lithuania and Spain _ and
beat two of the strongest teams in the field (Russia in overtime,
and Puerto Rico).
	   The Yugoslavs have a feel for the game like nobody else in
Europe, and the best pedigree on the continent: 1990 world
champions, '95 and '97 European champion and silver medalist two
years ago in Atlanta behind the NBA stars.
	   Zeljko Rebraca, a great leaper and shot-blocker at 7-feet-1
(2.11), is filling in for Divac and the playmaking role has gone to
6-10 (2.05) Dejan Bodiroga, who plays all positions but center.
	   In the victory over Russia, he was 6-for-6 on free throws in the
final 52 seconds and scored 16 _ 14 from the line.
	   Yugoslavia opens in the second round Sunday against Canada and
then has tough games with close European neighbors Italy and
Greece.
	   In other key games Sunday to open the second round: Russia vs.
Italy, Puerto Rico vs. Greece, Australia vs. Lithuania, United
States vs. Argentina and Spain vs. Brazil.
	   The top eight teams when the second round ends Tuesday advance
to the quarterfinals with the final set for Aug. 9.
	   The surprise team of the first round was probably Spain, which
squeezed out one-point wins over Argentina (overtime) and
Australia. The Spaniards, silver medalists in the 1984 Olympics _
which set off a basketball boom _ haven't reached the quarterfinals
of any major tournament since taking bronze in the '91 European
championship.
	   Greece, powered by an 18,000 sellout _ the only team that's
drawing crowds _ got momentum with a 64-56 first-round win over
Italy.
	   The Greeks are looking for their first medal since the 1987
Europeans but could be hurting for fan support as half of the
six-million population of greater Athens heads out this weekend for
the islands and traditional August holidays.
	   A young Lithuanian team, also playing without NBA stars Arvydas
Sabonis and Zydrunas Ilgauskas _ two towering big men _ got a huge
boost from beating the U.S. in the first round, 84-82, to end
America's 26-game winning streak in the Olympics and worlds.
	   The key player has been former Seton Hall star Arturas
Karnisovas, who scored 29 against the Americans as he bids to be
noticed by NBA scouts.
	   Russia, silver medalists in the '94 worlds, may be the most
experienced team in the field but disappointed folding in overtime
against Yugoslavia.
	   Australia, among the pre-tournament favorites, dug itself into a
hole losing two of three games and will have trouble making the
final eight and matching its Goodwill Games silver medal.
	   What of the underdog Americans?
	   The mishmash of no-names is 2-1 and, without a star, must rely
on defense, scoring from nine or 10 players and the possibility
that other teams may overlook them.
	   ``We're probably the least experienced team in the tournament as
far as playing together _ and it shows, particularly in close
games,'' said David Wood, the 6-11 (2.06) center who has played
with eight NBA teams, plus CBA and European clubs.
	   ``I don't have a computer program in my head to say how we'll
finish here, but if somebody disrespects us and takes us lightly _
that would not be intelligent.''

	   FUNCHAL, Madeira (AP) _ A racing car driver spun out of control
Saturday during a rally on this Portuguese island in the Atlantic,
killing two spectators, news reports said.
	   The fatalities were a seven-year-old boy and a 21-year-old
woman.
	   Two others were injured in the accident involving race leader
Adruzilo Lopes of Portugal, Portuguese radio TSF said.
	   ``It is a very fast curve and there might have been some debris

Clinton proposes summit meeting with Obuchi on Sept. 21
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton called Japan's new
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi on Saturday and proposed a summit
meeting in late September, a Foreign Ministry official said.
	   Clinton told Obuchi that he hoped to talk about economic
conditions in Japan and other Asian countries at the meeting,
according to a ministry official who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   The U.S. President also congratulated Obuchi on the inauguration
of his new Cabinet, he said.
	   Clinton proposed the summit be held on Sept. 21, when he will be
in New York for a United Nations meeting.
	   Obuchi said he will try to arrange a visit after reviewing
domestic events and Parliamentary schedules, the ministry official
said.
	   During the 12-minute phone conversation between Tokyo and New
York, where Clinton was visiting, Obuchi said Japan's economic
recovery is the primary task of his Cabinet, according to the
official.
	   Japan has faced growing pressure from the United States to beef
up its banking system and boost its stalling economy.
	   The phone conversation was the first between Clinton and Obuchi
since he was elected prime minister Thursday.
	   Later Saturday, Obuchi also spoke with Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie by phone. No details of their conversation were immediately
available.

Rift between two possible coalition partners widens in election
</HEADLINE>
campaign &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The leftist Social Democrats and the
environmentalist Greens, long seen as possible coalition partners
after national elections next month, blasted each others' stances
on crime Saturday, widening a rift between the two parties.
	   Following a Greens party proposal Thursday to get rid of life
sentences in favor of re-socializing criminals, the Social
Democrats parliament faction manager, Peter Struck, told Inforadio
Berlin/Brandenburg Saturday it was ``nonsense'' like other
proposals from the Greens over the past several months.
	   Greens faction chief Joschka Fischer defended the proposal in an
interview to appear in Monday's edition of Der Spiegel magazine,
accusing the Social Democrats of taking a reactionary stance in the
campaign.
	   Fischer told Spiegel the Social Democrats appeared to be moving
closer to Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative Christian Democrats
and Bavarian sister-party, the Christian Social Union, who he said
harbor thoughts of ``middle-aged'' methods in dealing with crime.
	   Fischer also accused the Social Democrats of having thoughts of
forming a grand coalition of the two largest parties after the
Sept. 27 elections.
	   The latest Greens proposal came after the dust had just settled
on two earlier controversial proposals by the party: triple the
price of gasoline and cut speed limits to 100 kilometers (62 miles)
an hour on Germany's super highways that often have long stretches
with no speed limits.
	   Both proposals were quickly rejected by Gerhard Schroeder of the
Social Democrats, the top challenger to unseat Kohl, who has
admitted he could foresee working with the Greens in a coalition,
but not under those conditions.
	   Schroeder also swiped at the Greens proposal to discard life
sentences, saying it put them ``on the way back into the corner
they were already out of,'' over the now-squelched gas prices and
speed limit ideas.
	   But Schroeder also played down the bickering in an interview
with the Augsburger Allgemeine newspaper, saying that the Greens
were in fact ``much more adaptable than their party program leads
one to believe,''

	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Flash floods have killed eight people in
western Yemen, an official said Saturday.
	   The eight people were drowned when floods engulfed their vehicle
as it was crossing a valley in the Red Sea province of Hodeida, 140
miles (225 kilometers) west of San`a, said the official, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
	   Only the driver survived, said the official. Three of the
victims' bodies have not yet been retrieved.
	   The floods were caused by heavy rains on Thursday and Friday,
said the official.
	   In 1996, about 200 people died in floods that swept through
several Yemeni provinces, causing damage estimated at dlrs 1.2
billion.

suspension given to Nigerian center Julius Nwosu after he tested
positive on Wednesday for the banned substance ephedrine.

KLA claims Serb attacks Saturday near Klina

<TEXT>
	   LIKOVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The Kosovo Liberation Army said Serb
police launched attacks Saturday against a cluster of 13 villages
southeast of the town of Klina, 50 kilometers (some 30 miles) west
of Pristina.
	   The report could not be confirmed. But a KLA commander said
police were targetting houses with artillery.
	   On Thursday, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic told a
European Union delegation that an offensive which began against the
KLA eight days ago had been completed.
	   But he did not say security operations would be halted entirely.

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Clad in everything from wedding
veils to leather G-strings, tens of thousands of homosexuals from
66 countries were partying as the weeklong Gay Games got under way
Saturday.
	   But here in Europe's self-styled homosexual capital _ where gays
and lesbians can marry, are welcomed in the military and are close
to winning adoption rights _ not even the bare-chested men with
nipple jewelry rollerblading through town were drawing many stares.
	   ``We're used to it,'' Andre Bakker said as he and his wife,
Florence, craned their necks for a glimpse of a dozen men in Dutch
milkmaid outfits dancing on a passing canal boat.
	   Founded in San Francisco in 1982 as a gay alternative to the
Olympics, the fifth quadrennial sports and cultural festival opened
amid clear signs that it has come of age.
	   Organizers said more than 200,000 visitors were in the Dutch
capital for the games, which run through Aug. 8 and will bring
together 15,000 competitors _ half again as many as the mainstream
Olympics.
	   No matter that they'll be handing out medals here for such
sports as ballroom dancing and oil wrestling. Or that a small
fringe group of hard-core homosexuals were running their own
``Queer Do-It-Yourself Games'' featuring purse-tossing and a
200-meter dash in high heels.
	   Thousands of tolerant Dutch lined the medieval canals Saturday
to wildly cheer on a Gay Games parade of boatloads of
transvestites.
	   ``We've certainly made enormous gains in this country, and above
all in this city,'' said Rene Zuidervelt, the editor of Gay News
magazine.''It's not like that in other countries where homosexuals
are oppressed. The Romanians and the Zimbabweans who compete here
can get a feeling of solidarity.''
	   Gays and lesbians have been progressively integrated into Dutch
culture over the past two decades. This year they won legalization
of civil marriage, and lawmakers now are leaning toward granting
homosexuals the right to adopt children.
	   Fifty thousand people were packing a soccer stadium on the
outskirts of Amsterdam for the Gay Games opening ceremonies under
the theme ``Friendship Through Culture and Sport.''
	   The main event was a concert by Dana International, the Israeli
transsexual pop star who gained notoriety and angered orthodox
leaders at home by winning May's Eurovision song contest.
	   Even so, the 1998 Gay Games aren't without controversy. On
Saturday, the European Gay and Lesbian Sports Federation called on
athletes to wear masks in protest of an International Skating Union
decision banning its members from future competitions if they
compete in Amsterdam.
	   Critics accused the ISU, skating's world governing body, of
homophobia. ISU officials have denied that, saying it was simply an
enforcement of longstanding rules forbidding participation in
unsanctioned and unofficial competitions.
	   None of that, though, came even close to stopping the Games from
going on.
	   The Amsterdam Gay Games are the first to be held in Europe. New
York City was the site of the last Games in 1994; Sydney,
Australia, site of the Summer Olympics in 2000, will have the first
southern hemisphere Gay Games in 2002.

	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Jamaica's major music festivals made
names for themselves with reggae, but these days, they're making
money with rap and rhythm and blues.
	   With reggae acts failing to draw as many local youths and
visiting tourists as in the past, festivals such as Sting and
Reggae Sunsplash have turned to chart-topping foreign acts to pick
up the slack.
	   The latest to follow the non-reggae route is the 5-year-old
Reggae Sumfest, which opens Aug. 2. Begun in 1994 as a clone of
Sunsplash, this year's program features chart-topping R&AMP;B acts such
as Boyz II Men, K-Ci and JoJo, in addition to the reggae music that
is part of its name.
	   ``It's a necessary thing because there is no young reggae act
that can draw the crowds,'' says Johnny Gourzong, a spokesman for
Sumfest. ``You have to give the young people what they want and
that is rap and R&AMP;B.''
	   In past years, local and foreign fans alike flocked to the shows
to see legendary acts such as Bob Marley, Peter Tosh and Jacob
Miller. But today, even the best reggae acts, such as Buju Banton
and Luciano, don't pack enough clout to pull big crowds.
	   Well known bands such as Jimmy Cliff and the British group UB40
are usually unavailable because of heavy summer touring schedules.
	   Sting, the hip, year-end music show that caters to an urban
audience, has gone farthest in taking advantage of foreign acts.
Thousands turned out to see the late rapper The Notorious Big in
1996 and a bigger crowd came for rappers Busta Rhymes and Foxy
Brown in 1997.
	   The foreign acts don't come cheap.
	   ``It is pretty expensive, but it's better than going for a cheap
act that won't draw people,'' said Gourzong.
	   The influx of foreign acts worries many in the Jamaica music
business.
	   ``We are our own worst enemies in this country and it's the
Jamaican artists who are going to suffer,'' said one band manager.
	   Others say the reggae festivals should feature reggae.
	   ``If you held a reggae show in LA and had Boyz II Men on it no
one would turn up,'' said Wayne Jobson, a disc jockey who hosts a
reggae show in Los Angeles. ``Point is, Boyz II Men doesn't know a
thing about reggae.''

	   FUNCHAL, Madeira (AP) _ Race leader Adruzilo Lopes lost control
of his car Saturday and killed two spectators during the Madeira
Wine Rally, news reports said.
	   A seven-year-old boy and a 21-year-old woman were killed and two
others were injured during the rally on the Portuguese island in
the Atlantic, Portuguese radio TSF said.
	   ``It is a very fast curve and there might have been some debris
on the ground,'' fellow driver Pedro Azeredo told TSF.
	   The organizers of the rally, held at the island's capital
Funchal, annulled the results of the day's racing, TSF said.

<TEXT>
	   LE CREUSOT, France (AP) o Marco Pantani moved to the verge of
the title of a tainted Tour de France that will be remembered more
for the drug scandal than the first Italian winning in 33 years.
	   Pantani held on to a lead of more than 3 minutes of his margin
after the 20th stage. Defending champion Jan Ullrich won Saturday's
52-kilometer (32.3-mile) time trial in 1 hour 3 minutes, 52
seconds. But he was nearly six minutes behind entering the day,
losing nine minutes on one poor day in the Alps.
	   On a rainy day in the Bourgogne region that typified the cloud
over the Tour, Pantani came in 2:35 behind Ullrich. In the first
time trial he lost more than four minutes to Ullrich.
	   Barring injury or accident, Pantani will wear the winner's
yellow jersey on the Champs Elysees Sunday, becoming the first
Italian winner of the Tour since Felice Gimondi captured the race
in 1965.
	   The 28-year-old Pantani lost nearly a year of competition in
1996 after a severe car accident late in 1995 broke his leg in two
places.
	   But he came back to take third in the Tour last year and has
taken six mountain stages in the Tour, including two this year. He
lost by 14 minutes to Ullrich last year.
	   Pantani also won the Tour of Italy this year and became the
first double winner of the two major Tours since Miguel Indurain
captured the two in 1993.
	   The Italian now looks to the world championships in Valkenburg,
Netherlands, in October.
	   American Bobby Julich, second at the start of the day, dropind
Pantani.
	   Pantani took over the lead on the first day in the Alps during
the 15th stage last Monday when he won the stage to Les Deux Alps,
turning a three-minute deficit to a nearly a four-minute lead over
Julich with Ullrich falling out of contention.
	   Ullrich had led after the 10th stage in the Pyrenees and looked
like a lock for his second title until he had his off-day.
	   Pantani thus takes the lead into Sunday's 21st and last stage
from Melun to Paris 147 kilometers (91 miles).
	   In the past the last day's ride would have the air of a
ceremonial parade ending triumphantly on the Champs Elysees.
	   This year, with doping revelations, searches and charges nearly
every day since the start of the Tour three weeks ago in Dublin,
Ireland, the end could not come soon enough.
	   With only 14 of 21 teams and under 100 riders remaining, the
Tour will limp into Paris. Rider protests delayed the start of the
12th stage and stopped the 17th stage twice, forcing organizers to
annul it.
	   Seven people have been placed under formal investigation for
doping-related charges -- three from the Festina team, two from
TVM, a doctor from ONCE and one rider, Italian Rodolfo Massi of the
Casino team.
	   Massi, the Tour's leading mountain climber, was the only rider
to be placed under investigation -- one step short of being
charged. The Festina team was expelled on July 17, a week after the
Tour started, after Festina team director Bruno Roussel admitted to
an organized system of providing performance-enhancing oned by
judicial police in Reims in the ongoing doping investigation.
	   The 1999 Tour de France is scheduled to begin in Puy-du-Fou.

IMF official discusses Russian loan package in Moscow

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia has made progress in getting its budget in
order but it is too early to tell whether the International
Monetary Fund will release the next installment of a
multibillion-dollar loan next month, a top IMF official said
Saturday.
	   Stanley Fischer, the IMF's first deputy managing director, told
reporters that the government had improved its revenue collection
and controls over spending, but that it had to keep up the effort.
	   ``Complacency must be avoided. A lot of work must be done in the
coming weeks and months,'' Fischer said.
	   Fischer's visit, less than three weeks after the IMF-led, dlrs
22.6 billion bailout was announced, signaled the international
financial community's determination to keep up the pressure on
Russia's government to keep its promises.
	   ``The program is so important that I thought it would be useful
to discuss what has been happening with the government,'' Fischer
told reporters.
	   Russia has already received dlrs 4.8 billion of the IMF portion
of the package. The fund will decide on releasing the next portion
in September, after evaluating the steps the government takes in
the tax reform program that went into effect on Saturday.
	   ``July testifies to good progress and if things continue to go
that way, a positive decision can be expected from the (IMF)
council of directors on extending Russia the second tranche,''
Fisher said.
	   He said that the IMF's decision would depend on the results
achieved in August.
	   ``There is every reason to believe that the Cabinet will realize
these measures,'' said Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais,
Russia's liaison with international organizations, who met with
Fischer on Saturday.
	   He said that the situation on Russia's financial markets
remained ``complicated'' but that ``the main danger had passed'' _
adding that he intended to go through with his two-week vacation
beginning next week to prove it.
	   ``I'm calm about Russia, even though one should never calm
down,'' he said.

Iranian convicted in Bakhtiar slaying gets early release
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with confirmation, background on Hendi second person
serving time for a Bakhtiar attack to be freed &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French authorities granted an early release to an
Iranian imprisoned for the 1991 assassination of a former prime
minister of Iran turned opposition leader, officials said Saturday.
	   Massoud Hendi, sentenced in December 1994 to 10 years in prison
for complicity in the killing of Shahpour Bakhtiar, was freed
Thursday, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   He was confirming a report on France-Info. The radio said that
Hendi is now in Iran.
	   Justice Ministry officials could not be reached for comment on
Hendi's liberation, which came days after the official announcement
that Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine will visit Tehran this month.
	   Hendi, about 50, a former Paris bureau chief of the Islamic
Republic of Iran broadcasting network, was convicted of helping
killers enter France from Switzerland. At the trial, Hendi
acknowledged procuring two visas for the killers as a favor to an
Iranian official, but said he did not know about the assassination
plot.
	   Bakhtiar, the last prime minister under toppled Shah Mohamed
Reza Pahlavi, became a leader of the Iranian exile opposition in
France. He was strangled and stabbed to death at his suburban Paris
home, along with his secretary.
	   Ali Vakili Rad, the convicted killer, was sentenced to life in
prison.
	   Hendi was the second person given early release from a prison
sentence related to an attack on Bakhtiar.
	   In 1990, President Francois Mitterrand pardoned Anis Naccache,
the Iranian-backed Lebanese serving a life sentence for a 1980
failed attack on Bakhtiar in which two other people were killed.
	   Naccache was pardoned to obtain the liberation of French
hostages held by an Iranian-backed group in Lebanon.
	   The Foreign Ministry announced Tuesday that Vedrine will visit
Tehran on Aug. 22-23, the first visit to the Islamic Republic by a
French foreign minister since 1991.
	   The Foreign Ministry official said the freeing of Hendi was a
judicial decision with no ties to Vedrine's visit.

Afghan official conciliatory after talks with United Nations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ After four hours of talks Saturday
with a U.N. team, a Taliban official was hopeful that the two sides
would be able to resolve a dispute that has halted aid projects in
his capital.
	   No agreement was struck, but negotiations were to resume in the
next few days, after a break to allow the chief U.N. negotiator to
attend to unrelated business, according to Khalid Din Mohammed,
planning minister in the Taliban religious regime.
	   U.N. officials refused comment after the meeting in Kabul over
the July 20 expulsion from the capital of about 200 aid workers
from 38 independent humanitarian agencies who had been carrying out
or supplementing U.N. projects. The workers were thrown out after
refusing Taliban orders to move into war-damaged dormitories.
	   Aid workers say that the dormitories are unsafe and
uninhabitable, and that the order to move may have been a pretext
to get them out of Kabul after months of tension.
	   ``We are ready to negotiate anything which will benefit our
people,'' Mohammed said. ``Both sides are willing to resolve the
crisis.''
	   Mohammed's apparent willingness to compromise comes after a long
stalemate.
	   Taliban officials have imposed a strict interpretation of Islam
since capturing Kabul in 1996, barring girls from school and
confining most women to their homes.
	   International aid groups say they are committed to providing
education and other services to all, while Taliban officials accuse
the groups of flouting the country's laws and traditions.

	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The Angolan armed forces on Saturday
denied U.N. allegations that they have begun a forced recruitment
drive in response to the country's apparent slide back into civil
war.

visit.
	   Brahimi arrived in Luanda on Friday amid escalating tension
between the government and the former rebel movement UNITA.

Parnevik equals course record to take 2-shot lead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: WILL be UPDATED with third round. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Jesper Parnevik, who grew up nearby the
PGA European Tour Club, tied the course record with a 6-under-par
65 Saturday to complete his second round and take a two-stroke lead
in the dlrs 1.3-million Scandinavian Masters.
	   Parnevik was 8 under through 14 holes when play was halted
Friday because of darkness. A U.S. PGA Tour regular, Parnevik
birdied two of his last two holes for a 10-under 132 total midway
through the tournament that he won on another Swedish course in
1995.
	   Fellow Swede Michael Jonzon matched Parnevik's 65 and was at
8-under 134.
	   Swedish amateur Anders Hultman and Englishman Brian Davis tied
the course record during the first round Thursday. Hultman had a 76
Friday but easily made the cut.
	   Britain's Justin Rose, who shared fourth as an amateur in the
recent British Open, missed the cut by one shot after three-putting
on the final green for a 75. Rose, 18, also missed the cut in his
professional debut in the Dutch Open at Hilversum by one stroke a
week ago.
	   Joakim Haeggman of Sweden, who won the Scandinavian Masters last
year on another course, also headed home after missing the last two
rounds by a single shot.
	   Also missing weekend play was former U.S. Masters champion Jose
Maria Olazabal. The Spaniard, playing his worst tournament in seven
years, was 11 over par at the halfway point.
	   Davis shared third at 137 with fellow Englishman Paul
Broadhurst, Darren Clarke of Northern Ireland and Swedes Mathias
Gronberg and Mats Hallberg.

Spain shows leniency for pregnant Moroccan immigrant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A Moroccan teenager who braved the Strait
of Gibraltar at night in an overcrowded boat even though she's
eight months pregnant will be allowed to have her baby in Spain,
officials say.
	   The girl, identified only as Fatima, 19, was picked up at sea as
she and 14 other North Africans tried to reach Spain in a
dilapidated single-engine boat overnight Wednesday.
	   They were just a half-mile (kilometer) from their destination,
the town of La Linea, when a Civil Guard patrol boat spotted them.
	   The would-be immigrants told authorities they had paid as much
as half a million pesetas (3,300 dollars) to a Spaniard to get them
across the Strait from Ceuta, a tiny Spanish enclave on the
Moroccan coast.
	   Fatima said she was trying to join her husband, who'd made it to
Spain the same way and was looking for work.
	   She was taken to a hospital in the town of Algeciras and given a
checkup. Doctors said she was fine, and scheduled another
appointment for August 28, the newspaper El Mundo reported.
	   Spanish officials could not be reached for comment.
	   Normally Fatima would be repatriated immediately along with the
other 14 who wanted to reach Europe.
	   But deputy labor minister Manuel Pimentel visited her in the
hospital Friday and said that until the baby is born she can stay
in a shelter for immigrants.
	   After that, a humanitarian group which has taken up her case,
Algeciras Shelters, has a month to apply for a residence permit for
her.
	   Every year thousands of North Africans fleeing poverty attempt
to cross the Strait of Gibraltar, often in flimsy, overcrowded
boats. The trip is sometimes deadly. Last weekend a boat carrying
27 people from Morocco capsized, killing all but seven.
	   Spain is a favored point of entry because the stretch of sea
separating it from Africa is only 15 kilometers (nine miles) wide
in some places.

 &UR; Rebels attack town in western Uganda, burn hotels, kill police &QL; 
 &UR; By HENRY WASSWA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Rebels attacked Kasese in western Uganda
Saturday, killing two policemen and an undetermined number of
people when they burned two hotels, witnessess said.
	   A mini-bus conductor who managed to make it to Kampala from
Kasese said Allied Democratic Forces rebels struck the town 380
kilometers (235 miles) west of the Ugandan capital at 3 a.m.
(0000gmt).
	   Herbert Mugisha said the rebels burned down the Kagesera and
Moonlight Hotels in which an undetermined number of people,
including two South Koreans working at a nearby cobalt treatment
plant, were staying.
	   ``They first burned things before shooting, and when the army
came to defend the town, an exchanged ensued, but they (the rebels)
retreated towards the mountains,'' said Mugisha. ``We were so
frightened, and the lucky thing was that I was not in the hotel but
in a house.''
	   The rear bumper of Mugisha's bus was partially burned in the
raid. He said rebels doused 26 vehicles, including two buses and
three trucks, with gasoline and set fire to them.
	   Crowds of people gathered at Kampala's main bus park Saturday
afternoon to listen to the accounts of those who had arrived from
Kasese.
	   It was not immediately possible to reach military officials for
comment, and telephone lines to Kasese, a mining town in the
foothills of the Rwenzori Mountains on the border with the Congo,
were not working Saturday.
	   ``The rebels attacked at night, and we scattered in all
directions. The people in the hotels were trapped. We do not know
the number who died,'' said Deo Tibasiima, who also managed to
escape from Kasese and arrived later in Kampala.
	   ``The rebels shot at the army barracks nearby to divert
attention as the others were concentrating on burning the hotels
and the vehicles,'' he said.
	   The Alliance of Democratic Forces is made up of remnants of the
former Ugandan army which was defeated by President Yoweri
Museveni's guerrilla forces in 1986.
	   There have been reports that some members of the army of the
former Zaire (now Congo) and the former Rwandan Hutu army have
joined the ADF, which has bases at the foot of the Rwenzori and
also inside Congo.
	   The rebels generally hit civilian targets. Two months ago they
set fire to a technical training school in Fort Portal, 50
kilometers (30 miles) north of Kasese, killing at least 80 students
and carrying off about 100 others.
	   It is not known whether the ADF has a formal ideology, other
than wanting to destabilize Museveni's government. They are
believed to receive arms and supplies from Sudan.

Burley stars as Celtic starts season with 5-0 victory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) _ Scottish World Cup star Craig Burley
hit three goals and set up another Saturday as Celtic began the
defense of the league title with a 5-0 crushing of Dunfermline.
	   Watched by 60,000 fans at Celtic Park, Josef Venglos' team
scored three in the last six minutes past Dunfermline's ailing
goalkeeper Ian Westwater, who stayed on the field despite picking
up an injury early in the second half.
	   Burley's first, a 25-meter (yard) shot, was in first half injury
time after good linkup by Dutch midfielder Regi Blinker and Swedish
international forward Henrik Larsson.
	   Simon Donnelly added the second in the 58th with a well-struck
shot past Westwater from a clever, defense splitting pass by
Burley.
	   Central defender Malky Mackay headed home a corner six minutes
from the end, Donnelly then set up the fourth for Burley a minute
later and Burley shot home past a limping goalkeeper for the fifth.
	   Aberdeen, which went close to relegation last season but could
be a title contender this term, started with a 2-0 win at promoted
Dundee and its next league game is against Celtic.
	   Eoin Jess fired the first in the 21st from a pass by Billy Dodds
and Craig Hignett, signed from English club Middlesbrough, hit the
second four minutes later.
	   Scotland's 40-year-old World Cup goalkeeper Jim Leighton saved
Tommy Coyne's penalty to preserve Aberdeen's two-goal advantage
just before half time.
	   Kilmarnock downed Dundee United 2-0 with goals by Paul Wright
and Pat Nevin and Motherwell edged St. Johnstone 1-0 thanks to
Jered Stirling's goal early in the second half.
	   Rangers, whose streak of nine titles in a row was ended by
Celtic next season, starts with a tough game at another title
contender, Hearts, on Sunday.

Bomb explodes in Northern Ireland town
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with area being cleared at time of explosion, previous
attack on Banbridge &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ A car bomb exploded Saturday in
Banbridge, a mostly Protestant town 20 miles (35 kms) southwest of
Belfast, police said.
	   The blast damaged several buildings and a number of people were
treated for shock, but there were no immediate reports of serious
injuries, police said.
	   No one immediately claimed responsibility, but police said there
had been a warning and the area was being cleared when the device
exploded.
	   Buildings in Banbridge suffered blast damage in April 1994 from
a bomb hidden inside a van. A police officer was hospitalized with
leg injuries and several elderly residents were treated for shock
in that attack. No one claimed responsibility.

Pakistan summons Indian envoy over Kashmir fighting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with envoy summoned, UPDATE Indian
toll to 29 from 23. TRIMS. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By DONNA BRYSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan's foreign ministry summoned
the Indian envoy Saturday to protest an unleashing of mortars and
artillery by Indian troops in the disputed territory of Kashmir
that killed a reported 80 Pakistanis.
	   Indian Acting High Commissioner Sharat Sabharwal rejected the
protest, an official at the Indian High Commission in Islamabad
said on condition of anonymity. The official said that while he had
no confirmation that Indian troops had fired at all in recent days,
such firing in the past has been provoked by Pakistani firing.
	   In a statement, the Pakistani foreign ministry accused India of
``unprovoked and indiscriminate firing'' along their disputed
border, known as the line of control, that undermined ``the
prospects for a resumption of meaningful talks between Pakistan and
India.''
	   ``The government of India must desist from further violations of
the (line of control) and escalation of the existing tensions in
the region,'' the Pakistani statement said.
	   Increasingly bitter rhetoric has accompanied unrest along the
border. As peace talks between Indian and Pakistani leaders on the
Indian Ocean island of Sri Lanka reached a deadlock Friday, an
Indian spokesman accused Pakistan of being ``obsessive'' and
``neurotic'' about Kashmir, and Pakistan charging that India was
``rigid and inflexible.''
	   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir since both
nations became independent nearly 51 years ago. It is divided
between them by the 400-kilometer (250-mile) line of control
monitored by the United Nations. Both India and Pakistan claim all
of Kashmir.
	   Exchanges of mortar and gunfire are almost a daily occurrence,
but casualties of the magnitude of the past week are rare. In
September, at least 39 people died in a similar increase of
tension.
	   Majeed Malik, the Pakistani minister in charge of Kashmir
policy, said Saturday that 37 soldiers were among a total of 80
Pakistanis killed in firing by Indian troops that he said was part
of New Delhi's plan to derail peace talks.
	   Pakistani officials rarely announce military causalities. Malik
did not mention the soldiers' toll during a news conference
Saturday at which he updated the civilian death toll to 43 dead and
75 wounded. He reported the 37 soldiers to The Associated Press
only later.
	   India said its death toll was 29, according to United News of
India, including 16 civilians killed when Pakistani mortars slammed
into a military hospital.

Tropical Storm Alex weakens, but may veer closer to Caribbean
</HEADLINE>
islands &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Hurricane Estelle in the
Pacific. At 1500 GMT, Estelle was centered near 15.9 N, 114.3 W. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Tropical Storm Alex has weakened, posing only a
minimal threat to Puerto Rico and other Caribbean islands, although
it could come closer to land than earlier thought.
	   But the storm is centered farther south than had been expected,
a course that may bring it closer to the islands, Jerry Jarrell,
director of the U.S. National Hurricane Center, said Friday.
	   Meanwhile, Hurricane Estelle gained strength far off the Mexican
Pacific coast on Saturday, posing little risk to land but bringing
light rain to western Mexico.
	   The U.S. Hurricane Center said Estelle was about 555 miles (890
kilometers) south-southwest of the tip of the Baja California
Peninsula and moving west at 15 mph (24 kph), and churning maximum
sustained winds of 110 mph (177 kph).
	   Estelle was expected to continuing gaining strength over the
next day or so, until it moves over cooler waters, the center said.
	   At 11 p.m. EDT Friday (0300 GMT Saturday), Alex was located near
16.1 north latitude, 52.1 west longitude, or about 575 miles (925

	   MIAMI (AP) _ Tropical Storm Alex has weakened, posing only a
minimal threat to Puerto Rico and other Caribbean islands, although
it could come closer to land than earlier thought.
	   But the storm is centered farther south than had been expected,
a course that may bring it closer to the islands, Jerry Jarrell,
director of the U.S. National Hurricane Center, said Friday.
	   Meanwhile, Hurricane Estelle gained strength far off the Mexican
Pacific coast on Saturday, posing little risk to land but bringing
light rain to western Mexico.
	   The U.S. Hurricane Center said Estelle was about 555 miles (890
kilometers) south-southwest of the tip of the Baja California
Peninsula and moving west at 15 mph (24 kph), and churning maximum
sustained winds of 110 mph (177 kph).
	   Estelle was expected to continuing gaining strength over the
next day or so, until it moves over cooler waters, the center said.
	   At 11 p.m. EDT Friday (0300 GMT Saturday), Alex was located near
16.1 north latitude, 52.1 west longitude, or about 575 miles (925
kilometers) east of the Leeward Islands in the eastern Caribbean.
	   The storm's wind speed decreased to near 40 mph (64 kph). It was
moving west at about 13 mph (21 kph).

With reggae failing to draw youths, festivals turn to rap, R and B

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Jamaica's major music festivals made
names for themselves with reggae, but these days they're making
money with rap and rhythm and blues.
	   With reggae acts failing to draw as many local youths and
tourists as in the past, festivals such as Sting and Reggae
Sunsplash have turned to chart-topping foreign acts to pick up the
slack.
	   The latest to follow the non-reggae route is the 5-year-old
Reggae Sumfest, which opens Aug. 2. Begun in 1994 as a clone of
Sunsplash, this year's program features chart-topping R and B acts
such as Boyz II Men, K-Ci and JoJo, in addition to the reggae music
that is part of its name.
	   ``It's a necessary thing because there is no young reggae act
that can draw the crowds,'' says Johnny Gourzong, a spokesman for
Sumfest. ``You have to give the young people what they want and
that is rap and R and B.''
	   In past years, local and foreign fans alike flocked to the shows
to see legendary acts such as Bob Marley, Peter Tosh and Jacob
Miller. But today, even the best reggae acts, such as Buju Banton
and Luciano, don't pack enough clout to pull big crowds.
	   Well-known bands such as Jimmy Cliff and the British group UB40
are usually unavailable because of heavy summer touring schedules.
	   Sting, the hip, year-end music show that caters to an urban
audience, has gone farthest in taking advantage of foreign acts.
Thousands turned out to see rapper The Notorious Big in 1996 and a
bigger crowd came for rappers Busta Rhymes and Foxy Brown in 1997.
	   The foreign acts don't come cheap.
	   ``It is pretty expensive, but it's better than going for a cheap
act that won't draw people,'' said Gourzong.
	   The influx of foreign acts worries many in the Jamaica music
business. Some managers and performers fear that by featuring
foreign, non-reggae acts, the festivals are hastening the demise of
reggae music.

Kashmir militants kill 4 in week's third major attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAMMU, India (AP) _ Muslim separatists made their third major
attack in a week in India's insurgency-torn Jammu-Kashmir state
killing four Hindu villagepeople in a remote mountainous area, the
police said Saturday.
	   Few details were available about the attack late on Friday night
at Sildhar Dhok, about 200 kilometers (124 miles) from the state's
winter capital of Jammu.
	   Police investigators had started a two-day mountainous trek and
were expected to reach the site late on Sunday, the state's
Inspector-General of Police Kuldeep Khuda told The Associated
Press. Khuda said the death toll could be higher.
	   In two separate incidents earlier this week, armed gunmen
stormed into the houses of villagepeople in the region and sprayed
the occupants with bullets, killing a total of 16 people and
wounding five others.
	   Friday's attack was the eighth time this year that suspected
Muslim guerrillas attacked civilians in the predominantly Hindu
region of Jammu-Kashmir, India's only state with a Muslim majority.

Fidel Castro honors victims of 1976 Cuban plane bombing

<TEXT>
	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) _ The beachside memorial is simple
enough: a small granite obelisk bearing the names of the 73 people
who perished when a Cuban airliner was bombed out of the sky off
Barbados 22 years ago.
	   But for Cuban President Fidel Castro, who was dedicating the
memorial Saturday, the site overlooking the crystal-clear waters of
Payne's Bay is a painful reminder of the price Cuba has paid for
its communist revolution.
	   The Oct. 6, 1976, bombing, blamed on anti-Castro activists,
killed 57 Cubans, including teen-age members of Cuba's national
fencing team, along with 11 Guyanese and five North Koreans.
	   Horrified Barbadians and tourists watched the Cubana airlines
plane fall from the sky about four miles (six kilometers) off the
western coast of the Caribbean island.
	   That act of ``criminal sabotage,'' Castro said Saturday,
irrevocably linked Barbados with Cuba.
	   ``The blood of those who died as a consequence of that crime
forever tied the bonds of friendship and solidarity between the
Cuban people and the Barbadian people,'' Castro declared, thanking
Barbadians for their frantic efforts to find survivors on that
sunny day 22 years ago. There were none.
	   Ultimately, four people were charged in Venezuela, where the
jetliner had taken off before stopping in Barbados. Two were
convicted, while the others, who had ties to U.S.-based Cuban
exiles, were acquitted.
	   For a time, the bombing thrust Barbados, just 10 years into
independence from Britain, into an international tug-of-war over
who should bring the suspects to justice.
	   ``This made Barbados grow up very quickly. We were under
pressure to be either pro-U.S. or pro-Cuban,'' said Glenroy
Straughn, 71, a former member of Barbados' parliament who visited
the monument to gaze at its names.
	   Saturday's dedication was a highlight of Castro's visit to
Barbados, the second leg of a three-nation Caribbean goodwill tour.
In Jamaica, Castro won hearty support for his campaign to lift the
U.S. embargo on Cuba. On Sunday, he was to travel to Grenada, where
U.S. troops invaded in 1983 to oust hard-line Marxists who had
overthrown a Castro-allied government in a bloody coup.
	   At dawn on Saturday, Castro, 71, led a 1,000-yard (900 meter)
public procession to a statue celebrating Barbadians' full
emancipation from slavery 160 years ago. He vowed to continue the
liberation struggle for his Caribbean neighbors.
	   ``Barbados and the Caribbean may trust Cuba the way a tree
trusts its own roots,'' Castro declared.
	   Walking up a slight incline at a steady pace, Castro and
Barbados Prime Minister Owen Arthur were surrounded by citizens
carrying hibiscus flowers and ginger lilies to place at the statue
of Bussa, leader of an 1816 slave revolt. In the throng, a trio of
Carnival celebrants walked on 10-foot (3 meter) stilts to a gentle
rhythm laid down by bandsmen playing drums and flute.
	   Arthur dedicated this year's Barbados Emancipation Day holiday
to the pan-African liberation struggle and thanked Castro for
Cuba's support in ending apartheid in South Africa.
	   Castro said the emancipation struggle continues _ especially in
the former European slave colonies of the Caribbean, whose
livelihood is threatened by such actions as a U.S. challenge in the
World Trade Organization to European incentives for bananas, a
lifeline for many Caribbean nations.
	   ``We believe it to be extremely unfair and selfish that through
the World Trade Organization, the Caribbean countries will be
deprived of their modest quotas in the banana market, just to
please the insatiable appetite of three or four powerful American
transnationals,'' he said to cheers.
	   Tracing his own revolution to 18th and 19th century slave
revolts in the Caribbean, Castro took a jab at the 1898 U.S.
occupation of Cuba during the Spanish-American War.
	   ``Years of struggle'' for Cuban independence from Spain, he
said, ``culminated exactly 100 years ago with the frustration of
our independence by the intervention of a greedy foreign power.''

Health officials warn of possible dengue epidemic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ A federal health official says
steps must be taken to avoid a dengue epidemic ``never before
seen'' in Puerto Rico, a newspaper reported Saturday.
	   Gary Clark, the director of the local office of the federal
Centers for Disease Control, told the newspaper El Nuevo Dia that
the number of cases of the mosquito-borne disease is rising and the
worst is likely yet to come.
	   The highest number of dengue cases usually are reported in the
months of October and November, Clark said.
	   ``The last epidemic was in 1994 when 25,000 cases were reported
and 9,000 people were hospitalized. If this keeps going the way it
is, it could be worse,'' Clark said.
	   Puerto Rico Health Secretary Carmen Feliciano said the public
must cooperate by not allowing standing water to accumulate and
provide a place for mosquitoes to breed.

Bomb explodes in Northern Ireland town
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES ambulanceman saying six taken to hospitals &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ A car bomb exploded Saturday in
Banbridge, shattering shop windows in the center of the mostly
Protestant town, but no serious injuries were reported immediately.
	   No one immediately claimed responsibility, but police said there
had been a warning and the area was being cleared when the device
exploded outside a shoe store.
	   Kenny McMahon of the Northern Ireland ambulance service said six
people were being taken to a hospital but were not seriously
injured.
	   ``In the center of town there is quite a bit of damage and
mayhem,'' McMahon told Sky News.
	   The blast damaged shops up and down Newry Street, and a number
of people were treated for shock, police said.
	   Irish Republican Army dissidents opposed to the group's
cease-fire, operating as the ``Continuity IRA'' or ``real IRA,''
have carried out several bombings and attempts
	   Buildings in Banbridge, 22 miles (35 kms) southwest of Belfast,
suffered blast damage in April 1994 from a bomb hidden inside a
van. A police officer was hospitalized with leg injuries and
several elderly residents were treated for shock in that attack. No
one claimed responsibility.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India and Pakistan pounded the territory
they both claim with mortar and artillery fire Saturday, killing
and terrorizing civilians and soldiers in Kashmir a day after
giving up on peace talks.
	   Rhetoric was harsh in a situation that appeared just short of
localized war.
	   New Delhi hard-line police minister Lal Krishna Advani was
quoted by the Press Trust of India news agency as saying that hopes
of better relations between the two newly nuclear neighbors were
dashed because officially Islamic Pakistan can't abide the idea of
Hindu-majority India having a slice of predominately Muslim
Kashmir.
	   Pakistan's foreign ministry, after the Indian envoy in Islamabad
rejected a formal protest over the fighting, accused India of
escalating ``the existing tensions in the region.''
	   Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee failed to make
headway this week in talks with his Pakistani counterpart, Nawaz
Sharif, in the Sri Lankan capital of Colombo. Both leaders were
unwilling to step back on their positions on Kashmir.
	   Both India and Pakistan claim all of Kashmir, which is divided
between them, and they have fought two wars over the Himalayan
territory since both gained independence from Britain in 1947.
	   Vajpayee and Sharif were meeting for the first time since the
two countries conducted nuclear tests in May. Officials said the
two are likely to meet again in South Africa in September, when
they attend a meeting of nonaligned countries.
	   Majeed Malik, the Pakistan Cabinet minister in charge of Kashmir
policy, said 37 soldiers and 43 civilians were killed in firing by
Indian troops Wednesday, Thursday and Friday _ the days Indian and
Pakistani leaders were meeting in Colombo. Malik said the firing
was part of New Delhi's plan to derail the peace talks.
	   The Indian army did not comment on the Pakistani charge, instead
accusing Islamabad's forces of killing 29 Indian soldiers and
civilians in the three-day battle that was reportedly continuing,
United News of India said.
	   A military spokesman said the Indian dead included 16 civilians
killed when Pakistani mortars slammed into a military hospital in
the town of Tangdhar, some 200 meters (yards) from the mountainous
frontier and about 150 kilometers (90 miles) northwest of Srinagar,
the capital of Indian-held Kashmir.
	   On both sides of the border, thousands of civilians were
reported fleeing their homes to escape shelling. Firing continued
Saturday, but had apparently abated.
	   Exchanges of mortar and gunfire are almost a daily occurrence,
but casualties of the magnitude of the past week are rare. In
September, at least 39 people died in a similar outbreak of border
tension.

Environmental party member demands end to Formula One car racing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOGNE, Germany (AP) _ A member of Germany's Greens party on
Saturday took a swipe at Formula One auto racing, demanding it be
banned because it encouraged young drivers to speed, causing
accidents and deaths.
	   Greens traffic expert Egbert Nitsch was quoted by the Sunday
edition of the Cologne-based Sonntag-Express as saying ``it's not
only a case of several crazy people driving around in circles as
fast as possible.''
	   He said Formula One racing made heroes of the drivers and
encouraged young people, who dream of making millions like the
racing drivers, ``with a lead foot on the gas pedal.''
	   ``Especially young spectators think they must show that they can
race as well as Michael Schumacher. The result is accidents and
traffic deaths,'' the newspaper quoted Nitsch as saying.
	   He said that the Greens did not want to get rid of cars in
general, but reduce the risks in view of 8,000 traffic deaths and
16,000 permanently injured per year in Germany.
	   Nitsch also complained that the Formula One race cars use too
much fuel and poison the environment.
	   ``It's hardly up-to-date that the over-powered Formula One cars
with their incredible fuel consumption continue to drive,'' the
newspaper quoted Nitsch as saying.
	   In an interview with the same newspaper, Rainer Bruderle, the
centrist Free Democratic economics minister of Rheinland
Palatinate, said that motor racing was important to his state,
where the Nuerburgring race circuit is located.
	   Bruderle said that 2,500 jobs were dependent on the Nuerburgring
alone, and that a single Formula One race brought in 69 million
marks (dlrs 39 million) of business.
	   The jobs ``apparently don't make any difference,'' Bruderle said
of the Greens.
	   Federal Transport Minister Matthias Wissmann, who planned to
attend the Formula One race in Hockenheim near Heidelberg on
Sunday, told the newspaper the races are a great sporting event
mobilizing many fans and important to the regions in which they are
held.
	   At the same time, Wissmann said it was important that the racing
was restricted to the racing circuits and not on the streets, and
that top Formula One drivers like Schumacher and Mika Hakkinen,
privately advertise for traffic safety. .

U.N. aid agency convoy reaches thousands in south

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A 14-truck convoy with humanitarian
aid has reached the southern town of Prizren, where up to 35,000
refugees fled the fighting in the rebellious province,
international aid officials said Saturday.
	   Meanwhile, there were unconfirmed reports of more fighting in
some parts of Kosovo despite official assurances that the Serb
police offensive that drove rebel fighters from several strongholds
was over.
	   Maki Shinohara, a spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees, said the agency's convoy arrived in Prizren on Friday.
	   U.S. special envoy Christopher Hill said Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic told him Friday he would take ``personal
responsibility'' for letting U.N. and other aid workers deliver
food, medicine, blankets and other supplies to Albanians hiding in
forested hills after Serb forces drove the Kosovo Liberation Army
from several strongholds.
	   Also in Geneva, spokesman Roland Sigler said a smaller Red Cross
convoy arrived in Prizren to deliver several tons of food to
refugees from Malisevo, a stronghold of the Kosovo Liberation Army
recaptured by government forces earlier this week.
	   A small convoy carrying aid from the U.N. refugee agency, the
World Food Program and other charities delivered wheat flour, baby
biscuits, cooking oil, mineral water and other essentials to up to
1,000 refugees camped in the hills northwest of Malisevo.
	   One of the refugees, Tafil Morina, told reporters the conditions
were dismal, especially for women and children. ``Europe must help
us because the situation is critical,'' he said.
	   And Thomas Vargas, a UNHCR official, said, ``It's obvious that
if a political solution is not found very soon, we are on the verge
of humanitarian disaster.''
	   In Likovac, a stronghold of the Kosovo Liberation Army in the
northwestern Drenica area, a high-ranking KLA commander claimed
that Serb police had launched Saturday a new offensive against a
cluster of 13 villages.
	   He told reporters houses were being targeted by artillery in the
area located southeast of the town of Klina, 50 kilometers (30
miles) west of Pristina Prizren. At least one Albanian was killed
in the fighting, Albanian sources said.
	   Skirmishes continued Sunday elsewhere, with one KLA fighter
killed west of Pristina near the open-pit coal mine Belacevac,
scene of heavy fighting earlier this month, the same sources said.
	   In the area of Malisevo, a Serb policeman was killed in the
early hours of Saturday, probably by a sniper, the pro-government
Media Center said.
	   On Thursday, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic told a
European Union delegation that the Serb offensive which began
against the KLA eight days ago had been completed. But he did not
say security operations would be halted entirely.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia where Albanians form 90 percent
of the 2 million inhabitants.
	   Despite prior assertions that Serbian forces had regained
control of all highways, skirmishes with Kosovo's ethnic Albanian
rebels kept part of a main north-south road blocked, Serbian
sources said earlier Saturday.
	   Police sources in Pristina, the Kosovo capital, said a stretch
of the main Prizren-Pristina road was blocked about halfway between
the two cities.
	   They said police were trying to intercept small groups of KLA
fighters apparently trying to evacuate following their defeat in
Malisevo.
	   Adding to the tension was a bomb blast that destroyed a kiosk
early Saturday in Pristina, close to the main hospital. No one was
injured.
	   A senior Albanian politician cautioned Saturday that
negotiations between the ethnic Albanians and the government could
not be expected any time soon, referring to serious problems both
within the KLA and the Kosovo Albanian political spectrum.
	   But the Albanian, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a new
escalation of fighting was likely if talks between the Albanians
and the government do not start soon.

Bosnian Serb genocide suspect dies of heart attack in cell

quote from Bosnian Serb presidential aide questioning circumstances
of Kovacevic's death, quote from Kovacevic last year denying
guilt. &QL; 
 &UR; By WILLIAM J. KOLE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Bringing an abrupt end to a U.N.
tribunal's first genocide trial, a Bosnian Serb accused of
atrocities against Muslims and Croats at three infamous prison
camps died Saturday of a massive heart attack in his cell.
	   The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal said Milan Kovacevic died
between 9 and 9:30 a.m. in his holding cell in a high-security
prison outside The Hague, where he had been held since his arrest a
year ago.
	   Tribunal spokesman Christian Chartier said Kovacevic had a
history of chronic health trouble and had suffered strokes. He said
the body had been taken to a mortuary and that arrangements to
return it to Bosnia would follow a routine investigation by Dutch
authorities.
	   Kovacevic, 57, was charged with genocide, war crimes and crimes
against humanity for alleged atrocities committed in northwest
Bosnia's Prijedor region in 1992. He had pleaded innocent to all 15
charges against him and would have faced a maximum life sentence if
convicted.
	   He was the second Serb suspect to die in tribunal custody. In
June, a despondent Slavko Dokmanovic hanged himself in his cell
while awaiting the verdict in his war crimes trial.
	   Svetozar Mihajlovic, a top aide to Bosnian Serb President
Biljana Plavsic, said Saturday she was troubled over the
circumstances of Kovacevic's death and would lodge a protest
against the tribunal.
	   ``This case once again brings up doubts that our people indicted
for alleged war crimes are in The Hague in exceptionally difficult
conditions ... so difficult that we have the second case in a short
time that ends tragically,'' Mihajlovic said.
	   Tribunal officials could not immediately be reached Saturday
evening for comment. In the past, the U.N. court has said security
and surveillance are adequate for suspects who have not yet been
convicted of a crime.
	   Kovacevic stood accused of overseeing a vicious campaign of
arrests, rapes, torture and slayings of non-Serbs.
	   Prosecutors said Kovacevic was among a group of municipal
officials who engineered a violent campaign to expel Bosnian
Muslims and Croats from Prijedor between April and December 1992.
	   They had accused Kovacevic of guiding the campaign of atrocities
and of establishing three of the Bosnian war's most infamous prison
camps: Omarska, Keraterm and Trnopolje.
	   Hundreds of detainees were tortured and killed in the Serb-run
camps, according to Kovacevic's indictment.
	   Some of those who survived the attacks were executed. Many
others were rounded up and taken to one of the camps, where
hundreds were tortured and killed by their Serb captors.
	   Kovacevic's trial had just begun on July 6 and was the U.N.
court's first to deal specifically with the crime of genocide.
	   In testimony last month, one Bosnian Muslim prosecution witness
detailed the brutality he endured at the Omarska camp, claiming he
was severely beaten with batons and metal rods because of his
religious beliefs.
	   There were so many dead bodies at Omarska that large trucks were
needed at times to remove them from the camp, prosecutor Brenda
Hollis alleged in her opening statements.
	   She said camp personnel ``were free to kill, torture and rape,''
while their superiors, such as Kovacevic, did nothing to stop them.
	   Kovacevic, a former anesthesiologist and Prijedor mayor, was
arrested by NATO forces last summer in Prijedor.
	   Asked last year whether he had any regrets, Kovacevic protested:
``What kind of question is that?! I don't know what it was that I
did that I should feel sorry for ... I did nothing.''
	   Although Kovacevic was the first to stand trial on genocide
charges, he is not the only suspect facing that charge. Among
others indicted for genocide are the tribunal's top two suspects,
former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his wartime
military commander, Ratko Mladic. Both remain at large.

Palestinian official: Talks to end if no pullout agreement

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Just-resumed direct talks between
Israel and the Palestinians will end in the next few days unless
Israel accepts a U.S. initiative and agrees to withdraw from 13
percent of the West Bank, a top Palestinian official said Saturday.
	   Nabil Shaath, speaking to reporters in the Gaza Strip, said the
talks would end in ``two, three or four days ... unless the
Israelis come up with a miracle and declare their acceptance of the
American initiative and are ready to withdraw.''
	   ``Until now, we have nothing to indicate that Israel is ready to
accept the American initiative,'' Shaath said upon returning to
Gaza from a six-day trip to Austria, Morocco and Turkey with
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat.
	   Arafat said Saturday that despite the talks over the past two
weeks, ``Everything is still frozen.''
	   Asked what the next step would be he said only, ``We have to
wait and see.''
	   Shaath said the Palestinians had agreed to the meetings with
Israeli negotiators at the request of U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright.
	   ``We knew that the chances were slim but we sat and listened to
not give an excuse,'' he said. ``We tried and listened attentively
and received nothing from Israel. So the responsibility is in
Albright's hands.''
	   Shaath said he hoped the United States would put real pressure
on Israel ``to push things forward.''
	   After meeting with chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat in
Cairo Saturday, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Israel
was not taking the talks seriously.
	   ``The Palestinians have informed us,'' Moussa said, ``(that) the
Israelis were not speaking with any seriousness and did not put
forth any new suggestions.''
	   Negotiations broke down 16 months ago. For the past two weeks,

U.N. aid agency convoy reaches thousands in south

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A 14-truck convoy carrying
humanitarian aid has reached the southern town of Prizren, where up
to 35,000 refugees fled the fighting in the rebellious Serbian
province of Kosovo, international aid officials said Saturday.
	   Maki Shinohara, a spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees, said the agency's convoy arrived in Prizren on Friday.
	   In Geneva, spokesman Roland Sigler said a smaller Red Cross
convoy arrived in Prizren to deliver several tons of food to
refugees from Malisevo, a KLA stronghold recaptured by government
forces earlier this week.
	   A small convoy carrying aid from the U.N. refugee agency, the
World Food Program and other charities delivered wheat flour, baby
biscuits, cooking oil, mineral water and other essentials to up to
1,000 refugees camped in the hills northwest of Malisevo.
	   Meanwhile, there were unconfirmed reports of more fighting in
some parts of Kosovo despite official assurances that the Serb
offensive that drove rebel fighters from several strongholds was
over.
	   Many ethnic Albanians want independence for Kosovo _ a province
of Serbia, the stronger of two republics which form Yugoslavia. But
Serbs consider the province the cradle of their culture, and
Western powers prefer to see it remain part of Serbia, as border
changes in the Balkans often lead to further bloodshed.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the 2 million inhabitants
of Kosovo.
	   One refugee, Tafil Morina, said conditions were dismal,
especially for women and children. ``Europe must help us because
the situation is critical,'' he said.
	   And Thomas Vargas, a UNHCR official, said, ``It's obvious that
if a political solution is not found very soon, we are on the verge
of humanitarian disaster.''
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill said Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic told him Friday he would take ``personal responsibility''
for letting U.N. and other aid workers deliver food, medicine,
blankets and other supplies to ethnic Albanians hiding in forested
hills since Serb forces drove the Kosovo Liberation Army from
several strongholds.
	   In Likovac, a KLA stronghold in the northwestern Drenica area, a
high-ranking KLA commander claimed that Serb police launched a new
offensive Saturday on a cluster of 13 villages.
	   He told reporters that houses were being targeted by artillery
in the area southeast of the town of Klina. At least one ethnic
Albanian was killed, ethnic Albanian sources said.
	   Skirmishes continued elsewhere, with one KLA fighter killed west
of Pristina near an open-pit coal mine called Belacevac, the scene
of heavy fighting earlier this month, the same sources said.
	   In the area of Malisevo, a Serb policeman was killed early
Saturday, probably by a sniper, the pro-government Media Center
said.
	   Despite assertions that Serbian forces had regained control of
all highways, skirmishes with Kosovo's ethnic Albanian rebels kept
part of a main north-south road blocked, Serbian sources said
Saturday.
	   Police sources in Pristina, the Kosovo capital, said a stretch
of the main Prizren-Pristina road was blocked about halfway between
the two cities.
	   They said police were trying to intercept small groups of KLA
fighters apparently trying to evacuate following their defeat in
Malisevo.
	   Adding to the tension was a bomb blast that destroyed a kiosk in
Pristina early Saturday. No one was injured.

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A Bosnian Serb charged with
atrocities against Muslims and Croats at three infamous prison
camps died Saturday of a massive heart attack in his cell, ending
the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal's first genocide trial.
	   The U.N. Yugoslav war crimes tribunal said Milan Kovacevic died
in his holding cell in a high-security prison outside The Hague,
where he had been held since his arrest a year ago.
	   Tribunal spokesman Christian Chartier said Kovacevic had a
history of chronic health problems and had suffered strokes. He
said the body had been taken to a mortuary and arrangements to
return it to Bosnia would follow a routine investigation by Dutch
authorities.
	   Kovacevic, 57, was charged with genocide, war crimes and crimes
against humanity involving atrocities committed in northwest
Bosnia's Prijedor region in 1992. He pleaded innocent to all 15
charges against him and would have faced a maximum life sentence if
convicted.
	   He was the second Serb suspect to die in tribunal custody. In
June, a despondent Slavko Dokmanovic hanged himself in his cell
while awaiting the verdict in his war crimes trial.
	   Although Kovacevic was the first to stand trial before the U.N.
tribunal on genocide charges, he is not the only one facing that
charge. Others include the court's top two suspects, former Bosnian
Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his wartime military commander,
Ratko Mladic. Both remain at large.
	   A top aide to Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic said
Saturday that she was troubled by the circumstances of Kovacevic's
death and would lodge a protest against the tribunal.
	   ``This case once again brings up doubts that our people indicted
for alleged war crimes are in The Hague in exceptionally difficult
conditions ... so difficult that we have the second case in a short
time that ends tragically,'' aide Svetozar Mihajlovic said.
	   Tribunal officials could not immediately be reached for comment.
	   In the past, the U.N. court has said that security and
surveillance are adequate for suspects not yet convicted of a
crime.
	   Kovacevic stood accused of overseeing a vicious campaign of
arrests, rapes, torture and slayings of non-Serbs.
	   Prosecutors said Kovacevic was among a group of municipal
officials who engineered a violent campaign to expel Bosnian
Muslims and Croats from Prijedor between April and December 1992.
	   They had accused Kovacevic of guiding the campaign of atrocities
and of establishing three of the Bosnian war's most infamous prison
camps: Omarska, Keraterm and Trnopolje.
	   Hundreds of people were tortured and killed in the Serb-run
camps, according to Kovacevic's indictment.
	   Kovacevic's trial began on July 6, the court's first to deal
specifically with the crime of genocide.
	   In testimony last month, one Bosnian Muslim prosecution witness
detailed the brutality he endured at the Omarska camp, claiming he
was severely beaten with batons and metal rods because of his
religious beliefs.
	   There were so many dead bodies at Omarska that large trucks were
needed to remove them, prosecutor Brenda Hollis said in her opening
statement.
	   She said camp personnel ``were free to kill, torture and rape,''
while their superiors, such as Kovacevic, did nothing to stop them.
	   Kovacevic, a former anesthesiologist and Prijedor mayor, was
arrested by NATO forces last summer in Prijedor.
	   Asked last year whether he had any regrets, Kovacevic protested.
``What kind of question is that?! I don't know what it was that I
did that I should feel sorry for ... I did nothing.''

	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Just-resumed direct talks between
Israel and the Palestinians will end in the next few days unless
Israel accepts a U.S. initiative and agrees to withdraw from 13
percent of the West Bank, a top Palestinian official said Saturday.
	   Nabil Shaath, speaking to reporters in the Gaza Strip, said the
talks would end in ``two, three or four days ... unless the
Israelis come up with a miracle and declare their acceptance of the
American initiative and are ready to withdraw.
	   ``Until now, we have nothing to indicate that Israel is ready to
accept the American initiative,'' Shaath said upon returning to
Gaza from a six-day trip to Austria, Morocco and Turkey with
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat.
	   Arafat said Saturday that despite the talks over the past two
weeks, ``Everything is still frozen.''
	   Asked what the next step would be he said only, ``We have to
wait and see.''
	   Shaath said the Palestinians had agreed to the meetings with
Israeli negotiators at the request of U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright.
	   ``We knew that the chances were slim but we sat and listened to
not give an excuse,'' he said. ``We tried and listened attentively
and received nothing from Israel. So the responsibility is in
Albright's hands.''
	   Shaath said he hoped the United States would put real pressure
on Israel ``to push things forward.''
	   Negotiations broke down 16 months ago. For the past two weeks,
the two sides have been holding direct talks to try to revive them
and work out conditions for a long-overdue Israeli withdrawal from
the West Bank.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has refused to accept an
American proposal for a 13 percent withdrawal, accompanied by
Palestinian moves to increase security. The Palestinians have
accepted the proposal.
	   After months of unsuccessful shuttle diplomacy, the United
States said it was time for the two sides to work out their
differences themselves.
	   After meeting with chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat in
Cairo on Saturday, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Israel
was not taking the talks seriously.
	   ``The Palestinians have informed us,'' Moussa said, ``(that) the
Israelis were not speaking with any seriousness and did not put
forth any new suggestions.''

Illegal immigrants occupy Vatican mission
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with immigrants still inside mission, quotes,
background; ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; By JEAN-MARIE GODARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ More than a dozen illegal immigrants occupied the
Vatican mission in France on Saturday, seeking a direct line to
Pope John Paul II to press their demands for papers for 17
comrades.
	   Some 15 protesters, mostly African, entered the mission in
Paris' chic 16th district about 11:30 a.m. More than eight hours
later, they were still there, were served a meal and apparently
planned to spend the night.
	   Police remained posted outside the gates of the mission.
	   The Vatican representative to France, Mario Tagliaferri,
proposed to act as mediator after the immigrants refused a police
offer to meet with a delegation of protesters on condition they
evacuate the mission.
	   ``We have chosen to come to the Vatican mission to obtain the
intervention of the pope and find a morally viable intermediary
with French authorities,'' said Madjyguene Cisse, speaking for the
protesters.
	   He said the occupation was to back ``our 17 comrades of Saint
Bernard who still don't have their papers.''
	   The group goes by the name of the ``Paperless of Saint
Bernard,'' after a Paris church which served as a sanctuary for two
months in 1996 for some 300 mainly African illegal immigrants.
Police raided the church and expelled the group, but many since
then have become legal residents here.
	   A statement from the group said that some among them were now
being expelled from a new refuge, apparently run by a union that
has reportedly turned off electricity and water.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Seven police officers and three Tunisians were in
hospital Saturday after a group of illegal immigrants broke out of
detention center in the Sicilian town of Syracuse.
	   The ANSA news agency said 40 Tunisians at a center made a break
for freedom late Friday night. All but six were recaptured, it
said.
	   It said the illegals set up the escape by drinking shampoo and
liquid soap, then claiming they were suffering from food poisoning.
When medical personnel and guards rushed to help them, they used
the confusion to stage the break .
	   The Tunisians, part of a flood of clandestine arrivals this
summer on Italian shores, armed themselves with improvised weapons
and fought their way out of the center, it said. Police ran down
most of them in the streets of the city.
	   It said seven police officers and three of the Tunisians were
hospitalized.
	   In another escape, 20 illegal immigrants broke out of another
holding center near Palermo on Saturday. ANSA said 13 were
recaptured.

Portugual's Oliveira reportedly tapped to coach Spain's Betis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Antonio Oliveira is set to come out of
his brief retirement to coach Spanish club Real Betis, encouraged
by an offer of 150 million pesetas (about dlrs 1 million) per
season, the Lisbon sports daily A Bola reported Saturday.
	   Oliveira coached FC Oporto to its 4th consecutive Portuguese
league championship last season and then announced he was bowing
out of soccer for personal reasons.
	   The 46-year-old former coach of Portugal's national squad was
reportedly due to iron out the details of a two-year contract with
Betis president Manuel Ruiz Lopera over the weekend, A Bola said.
	   Betis officials could not be reached for comment.
	   The team was plunged into a search for a new coach after Luis
Aragones resigned last week. The Spanish season starts August 30.
	   The southern Spanish club returned to the first division in 1994
and finished in fourth place last season to qualify for a UEFA
berth.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India and Pakistan pounded the territory
they both claim with mortar and artillery fire Saturday, killing
and terrorizing civilians and soldiers in Kashmir a day after
giving up on peace talks.
	   Rhetoric was harsh in a situation that appeared just short of
localized war.
	   New Delhi hard-line police minister Lal Krishna Advani was
quoted by the Press Trust of India news agency as saying that hopes
of better relations between the two newly nuclear neighbors were
dashed because officially Islamic Pakistan can't abide the idea of
Hindu-majority India having a slice of predominately Muslim
Kashmir.
	   Pakistan's foreign ministry, after the Indian envoy in Islamabad
rejected a formal protest over the fighting, accused India of
escalating ``the existing tensions in the region.''
	   Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee failed to make
headway this week in talks with his Pakistani counterpart, Nawaz
Sharif, in the Sri Lankan capital of Colombo. Both leaders were
unwilling to step back on their positions on Kashmir.
	   Both India and Pakistan claim all of Kashmir, which is divided
between them, and they have fought two wars over the Himalayan
territory since both gained independence from Britain in 1947.
	   Vajpayee and Sharif were meeting for the first time since the
two countries conducted nuclear tests in May. Officials said the
two are likely to meet again in South Africa in September, when
they attend a meeting of nonaligned countries.
	   Majeed Malik, the Pakistan Cabinet minister in charge of Kashmir
policy, said 37 soldiers and 43 civilians were killed in firing by
Indian troops Wednesday, Thursday and Friday _ the days Indian and
Pakistani leaders were meeting in Colombo. Malik said the firing
was part of New Delhi's plan to derail the peace talks.
	   The Indian army did not comment on the Pakistani charge, instead
accusing Islamabad's forces of killing 29 Indian soldiers and
civilians in the three-day battle that was reportedly continuing,
United News of India said.
	   A military spokesman said the Indian dead included 16 civilians
killed when Pakistani mortars slammed into a military hospital in
the town of Tangdhar, some 200 meters (yards) from the mountainous
frontier and about 150 kilometers (90 miles) northwest of Srinagar,
the capital of Indian-held Kashmir.
	   Late Saturday, military sources were quoted by Associated Press
of Pakistan as saying that four Indian fighter planes briefly
crossed into Pakistani territory earlier in the day. There was no
report that the planes joined in the firing from ground positions,
though their presence added to the tension.

Gaudenzi, on rise again, reaches final of Generali Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KITZBUEHEL, Austria (AP) _ Italy's Andrea Gaudenzi, coming back
from a shoulder injury, Saturday reached the final of the Generali
Open by outlasting Spain's Francisco Clavet in three sets.
	   Gaudenzi, who had fallen to the world's 157th-ranked player
during the spring of 1997, ousted Clavet, 6-2, 2-6, 6-2 at the dlrs
535,000 event.
	   Gaudenzi, currently back up to No. 36, reached his second final
this year after winning at Casablanca in March. He faces Spain's
Carlos Costa, who beat Argentina's Franco Squillari, 7-5, 1-6, 6-3.
	   Costa, the No. 3 seed, needed one hour, 42 minutes to oust the
Argentinian in a see-saw match. He let the first set slip away
after holding a 5-2 lead before the Argentinian evened at 5-5.
	   Costa was routed in the second set, but cut back on his errors
and turned the match around to remain unbeaten at Kitzbuehel. He
won the tournament in 1995 in his only other appearance.
	   ``After winning the first set, I think I took too much of a
breathing pause,'' said Costa.
	   Gaudenzi is coached by Austrian coach Ronnie Leitgeb, who also
coaches the former world No. 1 and French Open champion Thomas
Muster.
	   ``Gaudenzi is back where he belongs _ a top 30 player,'' said
Leitgeb. ``Most importantly he's finally gotten out of Tom's
(Muster's) shadow.''
	   Gaudenzi broke Clavet's serve in the third set to go up 4-2,
dumping a drop shot after the Spaniard's overhead slammed from the
back line proved too weak.
	   Gaudenzi had set up the break by gambling, hammering shots deep
into the corners and along the lines. During the match he produced
twice the winners of Clavet, but also double the unforced errors.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Seven police officers and three Tunisians were in
hospital Saturday after a group of illegal immigrants broke out of
detention center in the Sicilian town of Syracuse.
	   The ANSA news agency said 40 Tunisians at a center made a break
for freedom late Friday night. All but six were recaptured, it
said.
	   It said the illegals set up the escape by drinking shampoo and
liquid soap, then claiming they were suffering from food poisoning.
When medical personnel and guards rushed to help them, they used
the confusion to stage the break .
	   The Tunisians, part of a flood of clandestine arrivals this
summer on Italian shores, armed themselves with improvised weapons
and fought their way out of the center, it said. Police ran down
most of them in the streets of the city.
	   It said seven police officers and three of the Tunisians were
hospitalized.
	   In another escape, 20 illegal immigrants broke out of another
holding center near Palermo on Saturday. ANSA said 13 were
recaptured.

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A Bosnian Serb charged with
atrocities against Muslims and Croats at three infamous prison
camps died Saturday of a massive heart attack in his cell, ending
the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal's first genocide trial.
	   The U.N. Yugoslav war crimes tribunal said Milan Kovacevic died
in his holding cell in a high-security prison outside The Hague,
where he had been held since his arrest a year ago.
	   Tribunal spokesman Christian Chartier said Kovacevic had a
history of chronic health problems and had suffered strokes. He
said the body had been taken to a mortuary and arrangements to
return it to Bosnia would follow a routine investigation by Dutch
authorities.
	   Kovacevic, 57, was charged with genocide, war crimes and crimes
against humanity involving atrocities committed in northwest
Bosnia's Prijedor region in 1992. He pleaded innocent to all 15
charges against him and would have faced a maximum life sentence if
convicted.
	   He was the second Serb suspect to die in tribunal custody. In
June, a despondent Slavko Dokmanovic hanged himself in his cell
while awaiting the verdict in his war crimes trial.
	   Although Kovacevic was the first to stand trial before the U.N.
tribunal on genocide charges, he is not the only one facing that
charge. Others include the court's top two suspects, former Bosnian
Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his wartime military commander,
Ratko Mladic. Both remain at large.
	   A top aide to Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic said
Saturday that she was troubled by the circumstances of Kovacevic's
death and would lodge a protest against the tribunal.
	   ``This case once again brings up doubts that our people indicted
for alleged war crimes are in The Hague in exceptionally difficult
conditions ... so difficult that we have the second case in a short
time that ends tragically,'' aide Svetozar Mihajlovic said.
	   A former lawyer for Kovacevic, Igor Pantelic, told Studio B
television in Belgrade that Kovacevic was denied proper medical
assistance and treatment, and he called for the resignation of
tribunal officials responsible for his care.
	   Chartier denied that the tribunal was lax in its care or
surveillance of jailed suspects. He said it recognizes the stress
they are under, and said Kovacevic had been under the regular care
of a heart specialist.
	   ``Obviously this is is a tragic coincidence,'' he said. ``There
is no grounds whatsoever for any connection. The tribunal has done
whatever it could to prevent these deaths.''

Yeltsin meets at country residence with intelligence chief
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin received the newly
appointed head of the intelligence service at his country home on
Saturday.
	   Yeltsin told Vladimir Putin, the director of the Federal
Security Service, what his agency's main tasks should be, and asked
about the progress of several criminal investigations, the
presidential press service said, without giving specifics.
	   Yeltsin appointed Putin, a former KGB spy, as head of the
security service a week ago.
	   Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said earlier in the week that
the move was intended to enhance the the authority of the security
service, the KGB's main successor. He said that Putin's priorities
would be combating economic espionage and illegal capital flight.

Taliban army reports victories in northern province
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with radio claiming all of Faryab
under Taliban control, minor edits. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's Taliban militia said
Saturday that it had captured all of Faryab province, a key
northern area on the threshold of its opponents' heartland.
	   Taliban radio reported late Saturday that its army had captured
Anekhui, which had been the only Faryab district not under its
control. Earlier Saturday, Interior Minister Mullah Hyrullah
Khyrkhaw said his troops cleared opposition fighters from the
province's districts of Dawlatabad and Faizabad in the province.
	   The Taliban official said enemy casualties were high but had no
figures. He made no mention of Taliban casualties, and the later
radio report made no mention of casualties on either side.
	   The report from the remote region could not be independently
confirmed. Attempts to reach the anti-Taliban northern alliance
were not immediately successful.
	   If the Taliban claim is true, it would put its troops just 100
kilometers (60 miles) across flat desert from Shebergan, the
stronghold of anti-Taliban faction leader Rashid Dostum.
	   Dostum has an arsenal of tanks, fighter jets and other equipment
at Shebergan. Another 100 kilometers east of Shebergan is
Mazar-e-Sharif, another opposition stronghold.
	   Fighting has been fierce in Faryab since early July, when the
Taliban militia first said it had taken the province. Since then,
both sides have claimed to have gained ground there.
	   The Taliban religious militia, which rules in most of
Afghanistan, has imposed a strict version of Islamic law in
territory it controls.
	   The anti-Taliban coalition is mostly made up of Afghanistan's
minority ethnic and religious groups, factions that sometimes fight
each other as well as the Taliban army.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Meeting with Chechnya's embattled president, Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko declared Saturday that the Russian
government would ``do everything possible'' to support the region's
legally elected government.
	   However, no new agreements were struck at the meeting and
Kiriyenko stressed that the two sides should concentrate on
implementing the pledges already made.
	   Now, Kiriyenko said, ``we need peace in the Caucasus, stability
and unity, and the resolution of economic problems can facilitate
that.''
	   The two leaders discussed cooperation on transporting fuel and
on social policies, including pensions, employment, medical
services and children's needs, Russian news agencies reported.
	   Meeting with Yeltsin on Saturday night, Kiriyenko also mentioned
energy, road construction, production of building materials and
foodstuffs as possible areas of cooperation, the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   Kiriyenko said that he and Maskhadov had discussed the
possibility of employing Chechnya residents in the so-called Black
Soil agricultural regions of Central Russia, and that he would sign
a decree on Saturday ensuring that up to 1,000 children living in
Chechnya would be able to vacation at Russian summer camps,
Interfax said.

German interior ministry alarmed at increased illegal alien
</HEADLINE>
smuggling &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Interior Minister Manfred Kanther is
alarmed at the increase of smuggling illegal aliens into Germany,
with the number nearly doubled during the first six months of the
year, compared to a year earlier, a newspaper said Saturday.
	   Meanwhile, Bavarian police said they had returned 46 illegal
entries from Afghanistan picked up near Wuerzburg to the Czech
Republic Saturday, after motorists on a superhighway reported the
group walking along the road late Friday.
	   Police said they also stopped a truck from the Czech Republic
shortly later and arrested two men suspected of smuggling in the 46
people after finding leftover food, empty water bottles and
clothing left behind in the back of the truck.
	   The latest report comes just two days after a van carrying
illegal Albanian aliens crashed near the Czech border in eastern
Saxony state killing seven people and injuring 20 others, several
critically. Two Czechs were arrested for smuggling the Albanians
into Germany.
	   According to the Sunday edition of the Berlin-based Welt am
Sonntag newspaper, Kanther said that during the first half of 1998,
2,160 illegal aliens had been picked up and expelled and 127 people
suspected of smuggling them into Germany were arrested.
	   That compared with 1,245 illegal aliens caught during the same
period in 1997 and 98 smugglers arrested, the newspaper said.
	   The report said that most of the human smuggling is across the
border from the Czech Republic into Saxony state. However, southern
Bavaria state, which also shares a border with the Czech Republic,
has also reported increased illegal entries there.

	   ESHOWE, South Africa (AP) _ A slain German nun who ministered to
South Africa's poor was buried Saturday at a Catholic mission in
KwaZulu-Natal.
	   Theodelind Schreck, a native of Gissigheim, Germany, was found
shot dead last week in a forest after she disappeared from the Holy
Childhood Convent school where she was principal. Her car was later
found near Durban.
	   A requiem mass was to be led by the pope's representative in
South Africa, the Rev. Archbishop Monteiro De Castro, and the
convent's bishop at St. Benedict's Cathedral in Eshowe, a convent
spokeswoman said before the service.
	   Schreck came to South Africa in 1970 to join the convent, where
she helped women in need. In 1977, the school became the first in
Zululand to admit children of all races.
	   Schreck taught Zulu, Afrikaans, religious education, computer
studies and science.
	   Two men appeared briefly in the Eshowe District Court on
Thursday in connection with her slaying.

Malcolm grabs sprint double with 200 meter gold
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANNECY, France (AP) _ Britain's Christian Malcolm confirmed his
reputation as one of track's most promising young stars Saturday,
lifting gold in the 200 meter sprint just days after winning the
100 meter event at the World Junior Championships.
	   Malcolm posted the best time by a junior this year, 20.44
seconds, to beat Bosnia's Jairo Duzant and Russell Frye of the
United States.
	   Malcolm won the 100 meter gold at the Annecy games Wednesday,
and has now repeated the feat of Francis Obikwelu, the Nigerian who
won gold at 100 and 200 meters in the 1996 World Junior
Championships.
	   In the women's 200 meter sprint, France's Muriel Hurtis won
gold, ahead of U.S. junior champion Shakedia Jones, who picked up
silver. Britain's Sarah Wilhelmy lifted bronze.
	   In other men's events Saturday, Kenya's Reuben Kosgei won the
3,000 meter steeplechase, while Mikulas Konopka of Slovakia lifted
gold in the shot put.
	   Marina Kupsova of Russia triumphed in the high jump, while
China's Fengying Liu won the discus.

Cuba rolls over Nicaragua and advances to finals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VANIA GRANDI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Cuba rolled over Nicaragua 14-2 Saturday in the
semifinals of the World Baseball Championhips, well on its way to
defending a title it has won 21 times.
	   Infielder Orestes Kindelan, 33, cracked a home run in the first
inning to give Cuba a jump start.
	   Danel Castro then smacked another homer in a six-run third
inning, and Kindelan repeated in the fifth to seal the match.
	   Starting pitcher Luis Lazo went the distance in a game halted
after the seventh inning because of the 10-run mercy rule. He
tossed a five-hitter and struck out five with balls that reached
speeds of 154 kph (96 mph).
	   Nicaragua appeared helpless against Cuba's pitching, scoring
only five hits the entire game. In past Worlds, Nicaragua has
collected five silver medals and three bronzes.
	   ``We never underestimate our opponents,'' Cuban manager Alfonso
Urquiola said. ``But now that the game is over I can say it was an
easy one.''
	   With the win, Cuba extended its winning streak at the Worlds to
40 consecutive wins since 1986.
	   In Sunday's final, Cuba faces the winner of Italy vs. South
Korea, scheduled for later Saturday. A victory would give Cuba six
back-to-back titles.
	   The South Koreans finished runner-up to Cuba at the 1994 Worlds
in Nicaragua.
	   Italy, where baseball trails most other sports in popularity,
reached the semifinals for the first time. Its best result in the
tournament is a sixth.
	   The United States and Canada failed to advance past the
preliminary round.
	   Although this edition of the tournament is open to professionals
for the first time, no players from the major leagues are
participating.

Iran bans pro-democracy newspaper
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with new quotes and
material &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Hard-liners in Iran's government banned a
liberal newspaper Saturday, dealing a blow to the moderate camp of
President Mohammad Khatami.
	   Hours before the ban was served on Tous, militants allied to the
hard-liners assaulted the newspaper's editor and threatened to kill
him. They also assaulted two Associated Press reporters who arrived
on the scene afterwards.
	   ``The attack both on me and the AP reporters has raised the
price of seeking freedom in this country,'' Tous editor Mahmoud
Shams said.
	   ``What is dangerous is that the fate of Mr. Khatami's government
will be determined in the streets, where militants are taking the
law into their own hands,'' Shams added.
	   The Justice Department banned the newspaper Tous with immediate
effect, justifying its move by citing ``several articles of the
press law,'' the official Islamic Republic News Agency said. The
report gave no details.
	   Hard-liners had targetted the newspaper for months as it
questioned the authority of Iran's spiritual guide, Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, asking how an unelected person could wield more power
than the president, who won more than 20 million votes in last
year's elections.
	   When hard-liners, who dominate the Justice Department, closed
down the newspaper Jameah last month, the editorial staff changed
the name to Tous and continued publishing.
	   The Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance, which licenses
newspapers and is run by a Khatami loyalist, sanctioned the move.
But the ruse infuriated hard-liners opposed to the greater freedom
enjoyed by the press since Khatami took office in August 1997. The
chief judge, Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, vowed to close Tous down.
	   During the past few days, both sides upped the ante. On Thursday
Tous ran as its front-page headline a quote from Khatami: ``Those
who oppose freedom in the name of religion are the enemies of the
people.''
	   At a Friday prayers sermon in Tehran, Yazdi attacked the
Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance, Ataollah Mohajerani, for
granting licenses to ``newspapers that have sprouted like mushrooms
and write whatever they want.''
	   ``The people will not tolerate such newspapers,'' he warned.
	   Tous replied with a scathing column on Saturday, entitled ``Mr.
Yazdi, please calm down.''
	   As editor Shams arrived for work on Saturday, about 30
demonstrators outside the newspaper's offices confronted him.
	   One protester punched him in the face, an eyewitness told The
AP.
	   ``We are here to kill you,'' Shams recalled the demonstrators
saying before colleagues whisked him away in a car.
	   Arriving shortly afterwards, two AP reporters were punched,
kicked and chased by the protesters. Anwar Faruqi, a Pakistani
national, suffered cuts on his hands and legs. Afshin Valinejad, an
Iranian, was kicked in the groin.
	   Later, the protesters told other reporters that they had not
beaten any journalists.
	   The demonstrators also said they were not affiliated with any
group. But such militants are believed to have powerful backers
among the hard-liners. Police did not intervene when they attacked
the AP reporters.
	   Tous was not the only paper to come under pressure this week.
Earlier, the managing director of the weekly Khaneh, Mohammad-Reza
Za'eri, was arrested for printing a letter by an anonymous woman
who criticized Iran's late spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini.
	   ``When I think of Khomeini, all that comes to mind are the
horrifying sounds of the midnight bombs that used to fall on Tehran
and the blood of thousands of innocent young Iranians who died in
that war'' with Iraq, the letter said, referring to the 1980-88
Iran-Iraq war.
	   While Saturday's banning represents an apparent victory for the
hard-liners and a defeat for the moderates, it is not expected to
affect Khatami's reform program in the long run.
	   Shams said of the scuffles outside the newspaper building: ``By
resorting to violence, the hardliners are showing their weakness.''
	   A conservative Iranian newspaper editor called Saturday for
Khatami to define what the press can publish, the official news
agency reported.
	   ``There should be benchmarks against which the freedom of the
press is determined and their definition should be the
responsibility of the president,'' said Seyyed Jalal Fayyazi, the
managing editor of Qods.

U.N. aid agency convoy reaches thousands in south

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A 14-truck convoy carrying
humanitarian aid has reached the southern town of Prizren, where up
to 35,000 refugees fled the fighting in the rebellious Serbian
province of Kosovo, international aid officials said Saturday.
	   Maki Shinohara, a spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees, said the agency's convoy arrived in Prizren on Friday.
	   In Geneva, spokesman Roland Sigler said a smaller Red Cross
convoy arrived in Prizren to deliver several tons of food to
refugees from Malisevo, a KLA stronghold recaptured by government
forces earlier this week.
	   A small convoy carrying aid from the U.N. refugee agency, the
World Food Program and other charities delivered wheat flour, baby
biscuits, cooking oil, mineral water and other essentials to up to
1,000 refugees camped in the hills northwest of Malisevo.
	   Meanwhile, there were unconfirmed reports of more fighting in
some parts of Kosovo despite official assurances that the Serb
offensive that drove rebel fighters from several strongholds was
over.
	   Many ethnic Albanians want independence for Kosovo _ a province
of Serbia, the stronger of two republics which form Yugoslavia. But
Serbs consider the province the cradle of their culture, and
Western powers prefer to see it remain part of Serbia, as border
changes in the Balkans often lead to further bloodshed.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the 2 million inhabitants
of Kosovo.
	   One refugee, Tafil Morina, said conditions were dismal,
especially for women and children. ``Europe must help us because
the situation is critical,'' he said.
	   And Thomas Vargas, a UNHCR official, said, ``It's obvious that
if a political solution is not found very soon, we are on the verge
of humanitarian disaster.''
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill said Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic told him Friday he would take ``personal responsibility''
for letting U.N. and other aid workers deliver food, medicine,
blankets and other supplies to ethnic Albanians hiding in forested
hills since Serb forces drove the Kosovo Liberation Army from
several strongholds.
	   In Likovac, a KLA stronghold in the northwestern Drenica area, a
high-ranking KLA commander claimed that Serb police launched a new
offensive Saturday on a cluster of 13 villages.
	   He told reporters that houses were being targeted by artillery
in the area southeast of the town of Klina. At least one ethnic
Albanian was killed, ethnic Albanian sources said.
	   Reporters later saw at least three villages burning and a stream
of people fleeing their homes in dozens of cars and other vehicles.
	   ``They burned everything,'' said Hamdi Doci, one of those
fleeing with his family in a car.
	   Three houses were afire when he left his village, he said. He
said Serb forces started shooting so that people would leave their
homes. Once they fled, he said, the Serbs looted the houses, doused
them with gasoline and set them afire.
	    &UR; Skirmishes continued ... PICKUP 13th graf pvs.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India and Pakistan pounded the territory
they both claim with mortar and artillery fire Saturday, killing
and terrorizing civilians and soldiers in Kashmir a day after
giving up on peace talks.
	   Rhetoric was harsh in a situation that appeared just short of
localized war.
	   New Delhi hard-line police minister Lal Krishna Advani was
quoted by the Press Trust of India news agency as saying that hopes
of better relations between the two newly nuclear neighbors were
dashed because officially Islamic Pakistan can't abide the idea of
Hindu-majority India having a slice of predominately Muslim
Kashmir.
	   Pakistan's foreign ministry, after the Indian envoy in Islamabad
rejected a formal protest over the fighting, accused India of
escalating ``the existing tensions in the region.''
	   Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee failed to make
headway this week in talks with his Pakistani counterpart, Nawaz
Sharif, in the Sri Lankan capital of Colombo. Both leaders were
unwilling to step back on their positions on Kashmir.
	   Both India and Pakistan claim all of Kashmir, which is divided
between them, and they have fought two wars over the Himalayan
territory since both gained independence from Britain in 1947.
	   Vajpayee and Sharif were meeting for the first time since the
two countries conducted nuclear tests in May. Officials said the
two are likely to meet again in South Africa in September, when
they attend a meeting of nonaligned countries.
	   Majeed Malik, the Pakistan Cabinet minister in charge of Kashmir
policy, said 37 soldiers and 43 civilians were killed in firing by
Indian troops Wednesday, Thursday and Friday _ the days Indian and
Pakistani leaders were meeting in Colombo. Malik said the firing
was part of New Delhi's plan to derail the peace talks.
	   The Indian army did not comment on the Pakistani charge, instead
accusing Islamabad's forces of killing 29 Indian soldiers and
civilians in the three-day battle that was reportedly continuing,
United News of India said.
	   A military spokesman said the Indian dead included 16 civilians
killed when Pakistani mortars slammed into a military hospital in
the town of Tangdhar, some 200 meters (yards) from the mountainous
frontier and about 150 kilometers (90 miles) northwest of Srinagar,
the capital of Indian-held Kashmir.
	   Late Saturday, military sources were quoted by Associated Press
of Pakistan as saying that four Indian fighter planes briefly
crossed into Pakistani territory earlier in the day. There was no
report that the planes joined in the firing from ground positions,
though their presence added to the tension.
	   In New Delhi, Indian air force spokesman Squadron Leader R.K.
Dhingra told The Associated Press that the report was ``totally
false and baseless.''

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ One amateur parachutist was killed and three
others were missing after a sudden gust of wind swept them into a
lake in northwestern Russia, the Ministry of Emergency Situations
said Saturday.
	   The four were among 13 young people taking part in training
jumps on Friday at an airport outside Petrozavodsk, about 700
kilometers (437 miles) north of Moscow, the ITAR-Tass news agency
said. The wind carried four of the parachutists into shallow water
and four others farther into the lake.
	   Rescuers quickly pulled the body of one parachutist out of the
lake but three others remained lost, the ministry said. The
20-year-old victim had drowned after her limbs became tangled in
the parachute lines, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   ``The jumpers were absolutely unprepared,'' said Col. Yuri
Ivukov, a representative on the local emergency situations
committee, according to ITAR-Tass. ``The boys and girls were
parachuting for the first time in their lives.''
	   He said the parachutists, most of them aged 15-17, had trained
for 4 hours on the ground before jumping, and that the training
organizers had apparently not checked on weather conditions.
	   The training was part of a survival course offered by a local
sports club, he said.

Parnevik takes two-shot lead

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Jesper Parnevik shot a 71 after tying
the course record earlier Saturday and took a two-stroke lead over
Ryder Cup teammate Darren Clarke going into the final round of the
dlrs 1.3-million Scandinavian Masters.
	   But Clarke, who had a 68, wasn't sure if he would be able to
finish the tournament. He might give up a potential winner's check
of dlrs 219,195 because his wife, Heather, is expecting their first
child Sunday night.
	   ``I just hope she doesn't go into labor tomorrow,'' Clarke said.
``Because if she does I will not be here. I don't want to miss the
birth. My family must come before my golf.''
	   Just in case, Clarke chartered a private jet that so he could
fly from one of Stockholm's two airports to Belfast, Northern
Ireland, and then on to Portrush by car.
	   Parnevik, who also played in the final group with Clarke before
finishing in a tie for second with him behind Justin Leonard in
last year's British Open at Royal Troon, said he would understand
if Clarke withdraws.
	   ``I hope that he doesn't have to do it, but I understand him,''
said Parnevik, who had a 54-hole total of 10-under 203. ``It's his
first child. I would have done the same thing. I was very nervous
when I was playing in Germany three years ago trying to make the
Ryder Cup team when my wife was expecting our first child.''
	   Parnevik, who tied for fourth in the British Open two weeks ago,
birdied two of his last four holes for a 6-under-par 65 in the
morning as he completed his second round, which was halted by
darkness Friday.
	   The Swede, who grew up nearby the PGA European Tour Club, didn't
play nearly as well in the afternoon.
	   ``I couldn't make my putts,'' he said. ``I was tired at the end
of a long day. I got up very early in the morning.''
	   Parnevik, a U.S. tour regular who won his first American
tournament in the Phoenix Open early this year, is hoping to become
the first two-time winner of the Scandinavian Masters. He won the
event on another Swedish course three years ago.
	   Michael Jonzon of Sweden matched Parnevik's 65 in the morning,
but struggled to a 72 in the afternoon at was alone in third place
at 206. Mats Lanner, another Swede, was fourth another stroke back
after his third cosenctive 69.
	   Craig Hainline, an unheralded American from Houston, shared
fifth with three othres at 208.
	   Britain's Justin Rose, who shared fourth as an amateur in the
British Open, missed the cut by one shot after three-putting on the
final green for a 75. Rose, 18, also missed the cut in his
professional debut in the Dutch Open at Hilversum by one stroke a
week ago.
	   Joakim Haeggman of Sweden, who won the Scandinavian Masters last
year on another course, also headed home after missing the last two
rounds by a single shot.
	   Also missing weekend play was former U.S. Masters champion Jose
Maria Olazabal. The Spaniard, playing his worst tournament in seven
years, was 11 over par after two rounds.
	   Colin Montgomerie, another member of Europe's sucessful Ryder
Cup side last year, shot a third-round 69 and was 10 shots behind
Parnevik.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Landslides triggered by heavy rains have
killed at least 32 people and injured 45 others in two Iranian
provinces, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported
Saturday.
	   The Natural Disaster Headquarters said it could confirm only 31
dead and at least 16 injured in Friday's landslides, but it
expected the casualties to rise.
	   A rescue operation involving 500 workers is ``proceeding
strongly,'' a spokesman for the headquarters told The Associated
Press.
	   The news agency reported that 30 people were killed in Masouleh
town in the northern province of Gilan and two people were killed
in the northeastern province of Ardebil. The headquarters gave a
death toll of 27 for Masouleh and four for Ardebil.
	   Witnesses and policemen fear more than 100 people may be buried
in Masouleh, the news agency said.
	   The headquarters said landslides and flash floods had washed
away scores of cars, about 100 cattle and six bridges.
	   However, electricity has been restored to Masouleh and some 50
cars have been retrieved from the river. the headquarters added.
	   In Ardebil, floods killed livestock and damaged orchards and
farms in 20 villages, the agency said.
	   Relief workers have rescued 700 stranded villagers in the
province, the report added.
	   In April, a landslide killed 55 people in a remote village in
central Iran.

After 3 weeks of flooding, Bangladesh rivers begins to recede
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ After leaving behind a three-week trail
of devastation, the floodwaters that have killed 327 people in
Bangladesh are beginning to recede, the government's weather
experts said Saturday.
	   ``The situation has started improving in the north as there have
been no fresh rains,'' said Sajedur Rahman, director of the
Meteorological Department in the capital Dhaka.
	   Rahman said satellite images had shown that the water level in
the major river basins of the rivers Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna
was receding, though the rivers were still flooded.
	   The flooding which started on July 10 affected 37 of the
country's 54 districts, marooning an estimated 10 million people.
	   The government's flood spokesman Mohammad Badiuzzman said
Saturday water levels were coming down in 24 districts, mainly in
the north.
	   ``The situation in the central and southern parts is serious
because the northern waters are now running to the Bay of Bengal,''
he told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.
	   In central Bangladesh, the flood has now hit at least 10 percent
of Dhaka's eight million people.
	   The affected areas mostly include the low-lying shantytowns on
the fringes of the city, but the overflowing River Turag that runs
through the northern outskirts of Dhaka is also beginning to touch
parts of a plush area that houses most of the diplomatic missions.
	   To many city residents, this year's raging waters are a grim
reminder of the 1988 flood disaster, the worst in the country's
history, when two-thirds of the city was drowned, including the
international airport which was shut down for a few days.
	   A flood protection embankment built after 1988 has partly helped
most parts of the city remain dry this year.
	   ``We can do nothing except pray to Allah,'' said Manjula Begum,
who lives in a three-storied building in Dhaka's uptown Tejgaon
district. Knee-deep waters lapping at the wooden bed on the first
floor forced her to move to the rooftop with her husband Morshed
Ahmed three days ago.
	   In other parts of the city citizens stepped out to help city
authorities pump out the water.
	   On Saturday, hundreds of volunteers joined engineers in dumping
sand bags to reinforce the 32-kilometer (19-mile) ring embankment
that protects half a million people from the Sitalakhya and
Buriganga rivers on the southeastern outskirts of Dhaka.
	   Panic ran through the residents after the rivers breached the
embankment at seven points on Friday.
	   Bangladesh, one of the world's largest delta, is crisscrossed by
hundreds of rivers which originate in the Himalayas and then run
through neighboring India into its Bay of Bengal.
	   With more than 120 million people, Bangladesh has one of the
world's highest population densities _ nearly 800 living in per
square kilometer (mile).

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Investigators have asked for indictments against
four retired air force generals and six other officers for an
alleged cover-up in a 1980 airplane disaster that killed 81 people,
Italian media reported Saturday.
	   The tragedy, known here simply as ``Ustica,'' is one of Italy's
enduring modern mysteries.
	   The request for indictments ``confirms that there was a big
operation, decided at the highest levels, to hide the truth,'' said
Sen. Daria Bonfietti, the head of an association of victims'
relatives.
	   Investigators are still not sure what caused the Itavia DC-9 to
blow apart on a flight June 27, 1980, from Bologna to Palermo,
sending everyone aboard to their deaths in the Tyrrhenian Sea near
the island of Ustica. Bonfietti's brother was among the victims.
	   In the request for indictment, the investigators admit they
still don't know who _ if anyone _ was behind Ustica, but they say
there was a cover-up and they suggest American planes might have
been in the area, according to news reports.
	   Ustica theories have ranged from bombs, to missiles going astray
to aerial dogfights possibly involving Libyan leader Col. Moammar
Gadhafi's plane. There have been charges that the investigation was
bungled and the truth hidden by an international cover-up.
	   The ANSA news agency said the request for indictments _ which
contains a lengthy report on the investigation _ found no
conclusive evidence of a bomb aboard the plane or the impact of a
missile.
	   In their report, the investigators say the cover-up may prevent
the truth from ever being known.
	   According to ANSA, they say the generals _ Lamberto Bartolucci,
Franco Ferri, Corrado Melillo and Zeno Tascio_ allegedly withheld
information sought by investigators, and altered other information
that they did provide.
	   The information involved the presence of any U.S. planes in the
area, it said.
	   Investigators have long entertained the possibility that a
near-miss by a close flying aircraft caused the crash. Mechanical
failure was previously ruled out, and traces of TNT were found in
the wreckage.
	   French, U.S. and NATO officials have long denied any military
activity in the skies that night. Gadhafi blamed the United States,
but offered no evidence.
	   More than 90 percent of the DC-9 has been salvaged from the
resting place of the wreckage 6,600 feet deep (2,200 meters) in the
sea, and the fuselage has been reconstructed in a hanger in Pratica
di Mare on the coast near Rome. Items as small as watches and books
have been recovered, most recently in 1992.
	   Scores of military personnel have been under investigation for
years on suspicion of tampering with radar and flight records that
might shed light on the crash. In the request for indictments, the
investigators cleared most of them.
	   The Ustica investigation is headed by Judge Rosario Priore, one
of Italy's top terrorism experts. The investigators are expected to
hold a news conference for Monday.

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Alex was barely strong enough to be considered a
tropical storm Saturday, but it was moving closer to some Caribbean
islands, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center said.
	   At 11 a.m. (1500 GMT) Saturday, the storm's poorly organized
center was near 17.5 north latitude, 55 west latitude.
	   It was about 370 miles (600 kilometers) east of the Leeward
Islands, and moving west northwest at about 15 mph (24 kph).
	   Maximum winds were near 40 mph. (65 kph).
	   Meanwhile, Hurricane Estelle gained strength far off the Mexican
Pacific coast on Saturday, posing little risk to land but bringing
light rain to western Mexico.
	   The U.S. Hurricane Center said Estelle was about 555 miles (890
kilometers) south-southwest of the tip of the Baja California
Peninsula and moving west at 15 mph (24 kph), and churning maximum
sustained winds of 110 mph (177 kph).
	   Estelle was expected to continuing gaining strength over the
next day or so, until it moves over cooler waters, the center said.
	   Little change was expected in Alex's strength, but the weather
service said it would send a plane into the storm Saturday
afternoon to determine whether it could be downgraded to a tropical
depression.
	   Meanwhile, a large tropical wave in the central tropical
Atlantic Ocean was moving westward at 15 mph (24 kph).
	   Slow development of the system was possible during the next day
or two, forecasters said.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Meeting with Chechnya's embattled president, Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko declared Saturday that the Russian
government would ``do everything possible'' to support the region's
legally elected government.
	   However, no new agreements were struck at the meeting and
Kiriyenko stressed that the two sides should concentrate on
implementing the pledges already made.
	   Now, Kiriyenko said, ``we need peace in the Caucasus, stability
and unity, and the resolution of economic problems can facilitate
that.''
	   The two leaders discussed cooperation on transporting fuel and
on social policies, including pensions, employment, medical
services and children's needs, Russian news agencies reported.
	   Meeting with Yeltsin on Saturday night, Kiriyenko also mentioned
energy, road construction, production of building materials and
foodstuffs as possible areas of cooperation, the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   Kiriyenko said that he and Maskhadov had discussed the
possibility of employing Chechnya residents in the so-called Black
Soil agricultural regions of Central Russia, and that he would sign
a decree on Saturday ensuring that up to 1,000 children living in
Chechnya would be able to vacation at Russian summer camps,
Interfax said.
	   The prime minister also broached the idea of setting up a
special economic zone in Chechnya, telling Interfax that ``it is
senseless to create the impression that the situation in Chechnya
is usual.''
	   The cease-fire and treaty that ended the 1994-1996 Chechen war
did not resolve the vital question of Chechnya's political status.
Chechnya runs its own affairs and considers itself independent, but
Moscow and the rest of the world treats it as part of Russia.
	   Violence and crime have continued to plague Chechnya and the
rest of the Caucasus region. Maskhadov _ who led Chechnya's war for
independence and was elected president 18 months ago _ has been
shaken by a fresh wave of violence in and around the republic,
including a July 23 attempt to assassinate him. Russia's special
envoy to Chechnya, Valentin Vlasov, was kidnapped on May 1.
	   Saturday's meeting near Nazran, the capital of the republic of
Ingushetia, was meant to shore up Maskhadov, a moderate who is
trying to control Chechnya's diverse and well-armed bands of
fighters. It fears that if he were to fall a more radical leader
could come to power.
	   ``The Republic of Chechnya has a legally elected government, a
legally elected president, and we will do everything possible to
support this government,'' Kiriyenko said after the meeting.
	   Chechen officials long have accused the Kremlin of failing to
fulfill its promises to rebuild the republic's war-battered
economy.
	   Maskhadov said that his meeting with Kiriyenko was encouraging.
	   ``For the last six months we have been on the edge, where we
wondered whether we should meet Moscow representatives at all,''
ITAR-Tass quoted him as saying. Now, he said, there is ``hope for
the resolution of the earlier agreements.''
	   However, the Chechen Foreign Ministry accused Russian troops of
firing Saturday into Chechen territory from the neighboring
republic of Dagestan shortly before Kiriyenko met with Maskhadov,
ITAR-Tass reported. Chechen presidential spokesman Mairbek
Vachagayev said ``it is too early to comment on this incident,''
though he considered it a ``provocation.''

Chiapas government to compensate widows of massacre victims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The Mexican state of Chiapas is arranging
compensation payments for 18 women whose husbands were killed in a
December massacre in the village of Acteal, a government official
said Saturday.
	   The women will each receive 5,000 to 15,000 pesos (dlrs 562 to
1,685) to compensate for the loss of their family's primary
wage-earner, state Deputy Secretary Roberto Munoz Lievano told the
government news agency Notimex.
	   ``I know that the money will not compensate for their pain, but
it would not be worthwhile to leave them to drift,'' Munoz said.
	   Forty-five people, mostly women and children, were slaughtered
on Dec. 22 in the village sympathetic to leftist Zapatista rebels.
More than 150 people, including state officials and police
officers, have been charged or are under investigation in
connection with the killings.
	   The massacre was one of the bloodiest acts of violence in
Chiapas, where rebels took up arms in January 1994 to demand
greater democracy and Indian rights. Peace talks with the
government have been stalled since 1996.

Soccer fan gets 12-year sentence for killing rival fan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK EPSTEIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ With the prosecutor calling it
``society's response'' to soccer violence, a fan has been convicted
for the first time in a violent death inside a Brazilian stadium of
a counterpart from a rival club, media reports said Saturday.
	   On Friday, a seven-member jury found Adalberto Benedito dos
Santos guilty for the 1995 murder of 16-year-old Marcio Gasparin da
Silva, who died from several blows to the head during a riot
between supporters of Sao Paulo FC and Palmeiras in a Sao Paulo
stadium.
	   Judge Cassio Modenesi Barbosa sentenced dos Santos, 23, to 12
years in jail.
	   ``The conviction is society's response to the vandalism and
savagery that has invaded soccer stadiums,'' prosecutor Eloisa de
Souza Arruda told reporters.
	   Dos Santos' attorney Laerte Torrens says he will appeal the
verdict and expects a new trial within eight months. He argues that
an autopsy proves his client didn't wield the death blow.
	   Nevertheless, the victim's family hopes the verdict will send a
strong message to soccer fans throughout Brazil.
	   ``We hope that the sentence will serve notice to others that
this just can't happen anymore,'' Gianir Gasparin, da Silva's aunt
told reporters.
	   In the past few years, clashes between fans of rival Brazilian
clubs have occurred with increasing regularity. Weapons range from
rocks and brass knuckles to guns and homemade grenades fashioned
from billiard balls.
	   Da Silva's death became an impetus for Sao Paulo authorities to
stop the violence _ mainly by organized clubs comprised of young
supporters.
	   Four days after da Silva's death, police and the local soccer
federation barred all fan clubs from state stadiums, a measure that
is still in effect.
	   Dos Santos was identified as a member of Palmeiras' ``Green
Stain,'' one of the most notorious fan clubs associated with soccer
violence. Green Stain and members of FC Sao Paulo's Independente
clashed on the field after the Aug. 20, 1995 Brazilian under-20
SuperCup game in Sao Paulo's Pacaembu Stadium.
	   Palmeiras fans swarmed onto the field to celebrate a 1-0 victory
and Independente responded by grabbing material from a nearby
construction depository. The two groups battled on the field for
more than an hour, with TV coverage showing a Palmeiras fan
clubbing da Silva over the head with a wooden bar.
	   After slipping into a coma, Da Silva died eight days later.
	   Sociologists say fans clubs are an escape valve for many youths.
	   ``They have no other channel for political and cultural
participation, so they channel all their energy into soccer,'' said
Mauricio Murad, who directs the Rio de Janeiro State University's
Permanent Center for the Sociology of Football.
	   Clubs with names like Blue Mafia, Youth Force, Wise Guy and
Loyal Hawks initiate the beatings or ``trophy hunts,'' in which
jerseys are torn off the backs of rival fans.
	   ``These youths suffer from a collective delirium as if they are
in the game,'' Murad said. ``They believe the game is won on the
field by the team and off the field by the fans.''
	   After da Silva's death, authorities dissolved the Green Stain
and Independente. In 1997, a court order abolished the Corinthian's
Loyal Hawks after members hurled rocks at their own team's bus on a
major highway after a key loss.

Norman and Ulihrach secure final showdown
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UMAG, Croatia (AP) _ Sixth-seeded Magnus Norman overcame Juan
Antonio Marin of Costa Rica Saturday 7-6 (7-3), 6-3 for a place in
the final of the dlrs 400,000 Croatia Open ATP tournament.
	   Czech Bohdan Ulihrach, who defeated defending champion Felix
Mantilla in the quarterfinal Friday, also maintained poise and
composure to overcome initial problems and win over Mariano Puerta
of Argentina 6-3, 6-3.
	   Norman, the ATP's No. 47, started slow and cautiously, making
his opponent work for points with risky winners before seizing the
match in key baseline slugs.
	   Marin saved five set points and looked threatening in the first
set tie-break, leading 3-1 with an extra serve. But the 23-year-old
bungled open chances or watched Norman produce fast and accurate
return winners.
	   In the second set, the Swede raced to a 5-2 lead and never
looked back, wrapping up the encounter on his serve.
	   Norman, shooting for his second ATP title, will Ulihrach in the
final. The Czech ousted up-and-coming Puerta earlier in the day.
	   Ulihrach, the tournament's seventh seed, was trailing 3-1 in the
first set, and a break and 3-2 down in the second, but rallied back
with fine serving and experience in match-clinching moments.
	   Although Puerta, 19, pulled off a surprise victory over '97
French Open winner Gustavo Kuerten, he lacked staying power in his
first ATP semifinal.
	   ``Puerta was probably tired after his three-setter with
Kuerten,'' Ulihrach admitted after the game. ``I had a good night's
sleep,'' the ATP's No.43 gave as a source of his victory.
	   Ulihrach, who secured his seventh career final, is hoping to win
his third title on Sunday.
	   ``If I win, I'll jump into the sea,'' he said. The Croatian Open
is played in a tourist resort on the northern Adriatic peninsula
and the central court is only a few meters away from the shoreline.

East African ministers sit down with mediators
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with beginning of talks, comments from Burkina Faso
officials. Edits to conform. CHANGES overline. No pickup.
 &UR; By BRAHIMA OUEDRAOGO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ The foreign ministers of
Ethiopia and Eritrea entered separate meetings Saturday with
African diplomats trying to mediate in a bitter frontier dispute on
the Horn of Africa.
	   The discussions began more than 12 hours ahead of schedule,
prompting optimism by Burkina Faso officials about the chances for
a peace agreement.
	   Eritrea's Haile Woldetensae and Ethiopia's Seyoum Mesfin had not
originally been scheduled to meet with the mediating team led by
Organization of African Unity secretary-general Salim Ahmed Salim
until Sunday morning.
	   Zimbabwe's Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge and his Djibouti
counterpart, Mohammed Musa Sheahim, were among the other mediators
taking part in the closed-door meetings held in Burkina Faso's
capital of Ouagadougou.
	   Burkina Faso Foreign Minister Ablasse Ouedraogo said he was
``very optimistic'' that the talks would eventually result in the
signing of a peace agreement.
	   Another Burkinabe diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity
held open the possibility that the Eritreans and Ethiopians would
meet face-to-face for the first time later Saturday or early
Sunday.
	   The mediators are presenting the antagonists with a list of
peace proposals hashed out by Zimbabwe and Djibouti. If the
blueprints are accepted by the feuding parties, a peace agreement
could be signed before the participants leave Ouagadougou, Burkina
Faso officials said.
	   ``We are going to invite the two ministers (of Ethiopia and
Eritrea) to join us together when the time is ripe,'' Ouedraogo
said earlier in the day.
	   Although Ethiopia and Eritrea have so far refused to meet
face-to-face over the border conflict, the two foreign ministers
shared the same plane Saturday morning to this West African
capital.
	   It was not clear whether the opponents had made direct contacts
as a result of the flight, and they were quickly whisked away from
Ouagadougou's international airport to different hotels Burkina
Faso diplomats.
	   Fighting broke out between the neighboring East African
countries in mid-May, and in early June both sides bombed each
other's territory. Several hundred people _ perhaps more _ perished
before the fighting subsided in mid-June.
	   Both countries have amassed troops along the contested portion
of the border and the situation is at a stalemate.
	   Ethiopia says it was Eritrea's invasion of the two districts of
Badme and Shiraro on May 6 on the western end of the 960-kilometer
(600-mile) border that precipitated the crisis and subsequent
fighting.
	   Eritrea has called Ethiopia's saber-rattling a ``bluff'' to
maneuver the international community into pressuring Eritrea to
withdraw. The two countries were one until Eritrea became
independent in 1993.
	   As many as 100,000 people have been displaced by the fighting,
according to one U.N. estimate. Ethiopia puts the figure at 180,000
while Eritrea says 100,000 of its people alone have been forced to
flee the conflict.

Sudanese government hints that it may stop aid distribution

	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The Sudanese government hinted Saturday
that it may stop the distribution of foreign aid to famine-struck
southern Sudan if rebels continue to plunder it.
	   The government's Humanitarian Aid Commissioner, Hussein
al-Obeid, said southern insurgents were stealing the food that
relief organizations were distributing among the tens of thousands
of people displaced by war and drought in the state of Bahr
al-Ghazal.
	   The U.N. World Food Program is air-dropping 9,500 tons of food
per month _ at a cost of dlrs 30 million _ into the south in the
world's largest aid operation.
	   ``When we gave the OK for the planes and plans to be
implemented, we were forced by humanitarian factors alone to take
such a position,'' al-Obeid said.
	   ``But to see food being snatched by rebel troops while civilians
are being denied ... this is a situation which we have to ponder.''
	   ``If this phenomenon is to continue ... the government could be
forced to take it into account,'' he added, without elaboration.
	   Under pressure from aid organizations, the United Nations and
donor countries, the government and the Sudan People's Liberation
Army rebels agreed in July to a three-month cease-fire to permit
the distribution of food aid.
	   Aid workers estimate that about 1.5 million people are facing
starvation in southern Sudan.
	   Al-Obeid said that in Wau, the capital of Bahr al-Ghazal, an
average of 60 to 70 per day die of starvation.
	   The people that arrive in Wau are ``in miserable condition, with
acute cases of malnutrition, dysentery, respiratory diseases,
tuberculosis, malaria and measles, among the children,'' he said.
	   He said the vast majority of the refugees are women, children
and elderly.
	   ``We have never seen among (the refugees) a young man or
able-bodied youth. This, of course, makes us wonder about what is
taking place on the other side,'' al-Obeid said, referring to the
rebels' recruitment of fighters.
	   The commissioner appealed to the world to help lift U.S.
sanctions on Sudan which, he said, were impeding the relief
operation by preventing the import of American spare parts for
trains to transport food and medicine.
	   The U.S. imposed the sanctions last November, accusing Sudan of
involvement in international terrorism.
	   An estimated 1.5 million people have been killed in the war and
consequent famines in southern Sudan, where Christian and animist
rebels have been fighting for autonomy from the Islamic north since
1983.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Meeting with Chechnya's embattled president, Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko declared Saturday that the Russian
government would ``do everything possible'' to support the region's
legally elected government.
	   However, no new agreements were struck at the meeting and
Kiriyenko stressed that the two sides should concentrate on
implementing the pledges already made.
	   Now, Kiriyenko said, ``we need peace in the Caucasus, stability
and unity, and the resolution of economic problems can facilitate
that.''
	   The two leaders discussed cooperation on transporting fuel and
on social policies, including pensions, employment, medical
services and children's needs, Russian news agencies reported.
	   Meeting with Yeltsin on Saturday night, Kiriyenko also mentioned
energy, road construction, production of building materials and
foodstuffs as possible areas of cooperation, the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   Kiriyenko said that he and Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov had
discussed the possibility of employing Chechnya residents in the
so-called Black Soil agricultural regions of Central Russia, and
that he would sign a decree on Saturday ensuring that up to 1,000
children living in Chechnya would be able to vacation at Russian
summer camps, Interfax said.

Turkey's pro-Islamic party denounces new mosque law

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ A new law that puts thousands of
independent mosques under the government's control has angered
Turkey's pro-Islamic party.
	   Parliament approved the bill, one in a series of measures to
curb Islamic radicalism, on Friday. Some 8,400 independent mosques
will now come under government control, Cumhuriyet newspaper
reported Saturday.
	   Under the new law, the government Directorate of Religious
Affairs will appoint clerics to all mosques and approve the
construction of new ones.
	   ``This is a sick mentality,'' Recai Kutan, leader of the
pro-Islamic Virtue Party said in an interview published in the
daily Yeni Safak.
	   The government introduced the law under steady pressure from the
fiercely secular military, which fears private mosques were
controlled by militant groups and were used to spread radical
Islamic propaganda. Friday prayers in some mosques are often
followed by demonstrations calling for an Islamic regime in Turkey.
	   After the summer recess, Parliament is scheduled to vote on six
other laws to crack down on radical Islam, including harsher
punishments for people violating the secular dress code.

Norman, Ulihrach secure final showdown
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UMAG, Croatia (AP) _ Sixth-seeded Magnus Norman wore down Juan
Antonio Marin of Costa Rica 7-6 (7-3), 6-3 on Saturday for a place
in the final of the dlrs 400,000 Croatia Open.
	   Czech Bohdan Ulihrach, who defeated defending champion Felix
Mantilla in the quarterfinals Friday, also maintained poise and
composure to overcome initial problems and win over Mariano Puerta
of Argentina 6-3, 6-3.
	   Norman, ranked 47th by the ATP Tour, started cautiously, making
his opponent work for points with risky winners before seizing the
match from the baseline.
	   Marin saved five set points and looked threatening in the first
set tiebreak, leading 3-1. But the 23-year-old bungled chances or
watched Norman produce fast and accurate return winners.
	   In the second set, the Swede raced to a 5-2 lead and never was
threatened, wrapping the encounter on his serve.
	   Ulihrach, the tournament's seventh seed, trailed 3-1 in the
first set, and was a break at 3-2 in the second, but rallied on his
serve and by taking advantage of his inexperienced 19-year-old
opponenent.
	   Although Puerta upset '97 French Open winner Gustavo Kuerten, he
lacked staying power in his first ATP Tour semifinal.
	   ``Puerta was probably tired after his three-setter with
Kuerten,'' Ulihrach said. ``I had a good night's sleep.''
	   Ulihrach, who reached his seventh career final, is hoping to win
his third title on Sunday.
	   ``If I win, I'll jump into the sea,'' he said.
	   The Croatian Open is played in a tourist resort on the northern
Adriatic peninsula and center court is only a few meters away from
the shoreline.

Spanish village fetes New Year in dead of summer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERCHULES, Spain (AP) _ Sporting straw hats and tank tops to
beat the heat, thousands of people strode across fake snow to the
tune of Christmas carols in Spain Saturday in a mid-summer
celebration of New Year's Eve.
	   No, Spain doesn't have a different calendar than the rest of
Europe. The mid-year celebration marking the year's end started
when New Year's Eve celebrations in this Andalusian village were
canceled in 1994 because of a power failure that lasted until nine
the next morning.
	   Everybody felt cheated, especially merchants counting on a
year's end burst of revenue. So local business people got together
and struck gold by founding the Berchules Association for New
Year's Eve in August, or ABNEA in Spanish.
	   On Saturday this village of 800 people, three taxis and one
restaurant swelled to a madhouse of up to 3,000 revelers as bands
played Christmas carols and the Three Wisemen rode horses over
cobblestones streets dusted with fake snow. There was even a
contest for best Nativity scene.
	   The lingering yuletide flavor is typical of Spain, where
Christmas is celebrated in earnest until the Epiphany on January 6.
	   ``It really is something special,'' one young resident said of
the transplanted fete. ``The atmosphere is better than on the real
New Year's Eve.''
	   Pilar Sanchez Bravo, a member of ABNEA, explained that the party
is held in August to accommodate the vacation schedules of the many
Berchules people who have emigrated far away, to Madrid or
Barcelona, in search of work.
	   ``This is the time when our children come home,'' she said.

 &UR; Sudan's government to resume peace talks with rebels on Tuesday

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Sudanese government officials will resume
peace talks with southern rebels on Tuesday, the Sudanese Foreign
Ministry said Saturday.
	   The talks in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa will be the
first negotiations between the warring parties since May when the
two sides met in Nairobi, Kenya.
	   In a statement published by Egypt's official Middle East News
Agency, Foreign Ministry official Hassan Abdeen said the agenda
would include the issue of self-determination for the people of
southern Sudan and the relationship between religion and the state.
	   The Sudan People's Liberation Army has fought since 1983 for
autonomy for the south's Christian and animist peoples from the
Islamic north. An estimated 1.5 million have died in the fighting
and consequent famines.
	   The military-backed government in Khartoum is dominated by
Muslim fundamentalists who have made Islamic law or sharia the
basis of the legal code. The SPLA has long rejected this.
	   Tuesday's talks will be held under the framework of
Inter-Governmental Authority on Development, or IGAD, which groups
Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Sudan, Somalia and Djibouti. IGAD
hosted the Nairobi talks.
	   The rebels and the government agreed to a three-month cease-fire
last month to permit aid organizations to distribute food and
medicine to the estimated 1.5 million people facing starvation in
the south.

Former champ trying unconventional treatment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOCA RATON, Florida (AP) _ Muhammad Ali reportedly is trying an
experimental and unconventional treatment for the Parkinson's
syndrome that has slowed his reflexes and made it difficult for him
to talk.
	   A retired dentist and oral surgeon claims his resonance machine,
which emits a weak magnetic field, could cure the former
heavyweight champion.
	   Ali has received five treatments, which consist of sitting
between two magnetic black, 2 1-2-meter (8-foot) high circles on
beach chair, according to The Palm Beach Post.
	   ``I've been to 15 different doctors,'' Ali said. ``None of them
have been able to do anything.''
	   Jerry Jacobs' device was not familiar to Dr. Robert Brodner, a
West Palm Beach neurosurgeon who has performed brain surgery on
about 60 people with Parkinson's.
	   ``I don't know what this fellow is talking about. I only hope
that he does,'' Brodner said. ``Any treatment that doesn't have the
potential to harm a patient can be considered.''

Police identify another victim of the Sao Paulo serial killer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Police have identified the third
of eight victims of a suspected serial killer who has terrorized
women in Sao Paulo for the past eight months, Brazilian media
reported Saturday.
	   Elisangela Francisco da Silva, 21, who was found a week ago, was
identified by her finger prints, O Globo newspaper reported.
	   Francisco de Assis Pereira, 31, is a suspect in the killing of
da Silva and seven other women, whose bodies were found over
several months in a thickly wooded park. Nine other women, who were
assaulted in the park but escaped with their lives, have identified
Pereira from composite drawings and photographs, police said.
	   Pereira, a motorcycle courier, was last seen two weeks ago at
his uncle's house 50 miles (80 kilometers) from Paraguay and may
have slipped across the border, Sao Paulo detectives say.
	   Da Silva, a student, disappeared May 9 after skating with a
friend at a shopping mall. She had then planned to travel by bus to
visit her parents in the southern state of Parana.
	   On Friday, Sao Paulo police combed the park looking for more
victims while forensic experts examined clothes taken from the
corpses to build a case against Pereira.

In Europe's gay capital, the carefree paint the town pink

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ They're painting the town pink.
	   Clad in everything from wedding veils to leather G-strings, tens
of thousands of homosexuals from 66 countries partied in the
cobblestone streets of Amsterdam as the week-long Gay Games got
under way Saturday.
	   But here in Europe's self-styled homosexual capital _ where gays
and lesbians can marry, are welcomed in the military and are close
to winning adoption rights _ not even the bare-chested men with
nipple jewelry rollerblading through town were drawing many stares.
	   ``We're used to it,'' Andre Bakker said with a shrug as he and
his wife, Florence, craned their necks for a glimpse of a dozen men
in Dutch milkmaid outfits dancing on a passing canal boat.
	   Founded in San Francisco in 1982 as a gay alternative to the
Olympics, the fifth quadrennial sports and cultural festival opened
amid clear signs that it has come of age.
	   Organizers said more than 200,000 visitors were in the Dutch
capital for the games, which run through Aug. 8 and will bring
together 15,000 competitors _ half as many as in the mainstream
Olympics.
	   No matter the scattered smirks over the fact that they'll be
handing out medals here for such ``sports'' as ballroom dancing and
oil wrestling. Or that a small fringe group of hard-core
homosexuals were running their own ``Queer Do-It-Yourself Games,''
featuring purse-tossing and a 200-meter dash in high heels.
	   The famously accepting Dutch, thousands of whom lined the
medieval canals Saturday to wildly cheer on a Gay Games parade of
boatloads of transvestites, have rolled out the pink carpet.
	   ``We've certainly made enormous gains in this country, and above
all in this city,'' said Rene Zuidervelt, the editor of Gay News
magazine.
	   ``It's not like that in other countries where homosexuals are
oppressed,'' he said. ``The Romanians and the Zimbabweans who
compete here can get a feeling of solidarity.''
	   Gays and lesbians have been progressively integrated into Dutch
culture over the past two decades. This year, lawmakers legalized
same sex civil marriage and are leaning toward granting homosexuals
the right to adopt children.
	   About 50,000 people, straight and gay alike, packed a soccer
stadium on the outskirts of Amsterdam for the opening ceremonies
under the theme ``Friendship Through Culture and Sport.''
	   ``Ladies and gentlemen, gays and lesbians, welcome to Amsterdam,
the `Gayway to Europe,''' an exuberant Mayor Schelto Patijn told
the roaring crowd.
	   The crowd cheered as the delegations marched in, the Japanese
team wearing traditional kimono, athletes from rainy Holland
holding aloft rainbow-colored umbrellas. Men in sailor's outfits
danced to rave music.
	   ``Many of us have competed in an environment where we have had
to hide a valuable part of ourselves. One by one we have faced
these fears,'' tennis star Martina Navratilova told the crowd over
via a satellite hookup and giant TV screens.
	   ``The Gay Games shows we are your brothers and your sisters,
your athletes and your artists,'' she said.
	   The main event was a concert by Dana International, the Israeli
transsexual pop star who gained notoriety and angered orthodox
leaders at home for winning May's Eurovision song contest.
	   Even so, the 1998 games aren't without controversy. On Saturday,
the European Gay and Lesbian Sports Federation called on athletes
to wear masks in protest of an International Skating Union decision
banning its members from future competitions if they compete in
Amsterdam.
	   Critics accused the ISU, skating's world governing body, of
homophobia. ISU officials have denied that, saying it was simply an
enforcement of long-standing rules forbidding participation in
unsanctioned and unofficial competitions.
	   None of that, though, came even close to stopping the Games from
going on.
	   ``This is certainly adding to our cultural experience,'' Bill
Mayer of Greensboro, N.C., said with a grin as he and his wife,
Kathy, watched two gay men in clingy black dresses and pumps walk
past arm-in-arm.
	   This year's competition is the first to be held in Europe. New
York City was the site of the last event in 1994; Sydney,
Australia, site of the Summer Olympics in 2000, will have the first
southern hemisphere Gay Games in 2002.

Iran bans pro-democracy newspaper
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Hard-liners in Iran's government banned a
liberal newspaper Saturday, dealing a blow to the moderate camp of
President Mohammad Khatami.
	   Hours before the ban was served on Tous, demonstrators assaulted
the newspaper's editor and two Associated Press reporters who
arrived on the scene afterwards.
	   ``The attack both on me and the AP reporters has raised the
price of seeking freedom in this country,'' Tous editor Mahmoud
Shams said. ``What is dangerous is that the fate of Mr. Khatami's
government will be determined in the streets, where militants are
taking the law into their own hands.''
	   The Justice Department banned the newspaper Tous effective
immediately, citing ``several articles of the press law,'' the
official Islamic Republic News Agency said. The report gave no
details.
	   Hard-liners, who dominate the Justice Department, had targeted
the newspaper for months because it questioned the authority of
Iran's spiritual guide, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The newspaper asked
how an unelected person could wield more power than the president,
who won more than 20 million votes in last year's elections.
	   When hard-liners closed down the newspaper Jameah last month,
the editorial staff changed the name to Tous and continued
publishing.
	   The Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance, which licenses
newspapers and is run by a Khatami loyalist, sanctioned the change,
infuriating hard-liners opposed to the greater freedom Khatami has
promoted since he took office. Chief Justice Ayatollah Mohammad
Yazdi vowed to close Tous down.
	   On Thursday, Tous ran as its front-page headline a quote from
Khatami: ``Those who oppose freedom in the name of religion are the
enemies of the people.''
	   At a Friday prayer sermon in Tehran, Yazdi attacked the Minister
of Culture and Islamic Guidance, Ataollah Mohajerani, for granting
licenses to ``newspapers that have sprouted like mushrooms and
write whatever they want.''
	   ``The people will not tolerate such newspapers,'' he warned.
	   Tous replied with a Saturday column that said, ``Mr. Yazdi,
please calm down.''
	   As Shams arrived for work Saturday, about 30 demonstrators
outside the newspaper's offices confronted him. One protester
punched him in the face, an eyewitness told the AP.
	   ``We are here to kill you,'' Shams recalled the demonstrators
saying before colleagues whisked him away in a car.
	   Arriving shortly afterwards, two AP reporters were punched,
kicked and chased by the protesters. Anwar Faruqi, a Pakistani
national, suffered cuts on his hands and legs. Afshin Valinejad, an
Iranian, was kicked in the groin.
	   Later, the protesters told other reporters they did not assault
any journalists.
	   The demonstrators also said they were not affiliated with any
group. But such militants are believed to have powerful backers
among the hard-liners.

Sudan's government to resume peace talks with rebels on Tuesday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Sudan-Aid &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Sudanese officials will resume peace talks
with southern rebels on Tuesday, the Sudanese Foreign Ministry said
Saturday.
	   The talks in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa will be the
first negotiations between the warring parties since May when the
two sides met in Nairobi, Kenya.
	   In a statement published by Egypt's official Middle East News
Agency, Foreign Ministry official Hassan Abdeen said the agenda
would include the issue of self-determination for the people of
southern Sudan and the relationship between religion and state.
	   The Sudan People's Liberation Army has fought since 1983 for
autonomy for the south's Christian and animist peoples from the
Islamic north. An estimated 1.5 million have died in the fighting
and war-induced famines.
	   The military-backed government in Khartoum is dominated by
Muslim fundamentalists who have made Islamic law the basis of the
legal code, something the SPLA rejects.
	   Tuesday's talks will be held under the framework of the
Inter-Governmental Authority on Development, which groups Kenya,
Uganda, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Sudan, Somalia and Djibouti. IGAD hosted
the Nairobi talks.
	   The rebels and the government agreed to a three-month cease-fire
last month to permit aid organizations to distribute food and
medicine to the estimated 1.5 million people facing starvation in
the south.

<TEXT>
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ The foreign ministers of
Ethiopia and Eritrea held separate meetings Saturday with African
diplomats trying to mediate in a bitter frontier dispute on the
Horn of Africa.
	   The discussions began more than 12 hours ahead of schedule,
prompting optimism by Burkina Faso officials about the chances for
a peace agreement.
	   Eritrea's Haile Woldetensae and Ethiopia's Seyoum Mesfin had not
originally been scheduled to meet with the mediating team led by
Organization of African Unity secretary-general Salim Ahmed Salim
until Sunday morning.
	   Woldetensae emerged from three hours of talks with the
mediators, saying his country was ready for an immediate ceasefire
but was unprepared to withdraw from disputed land, which has been
an Ethiopian precondition for face-to-face talks.
	   ``Eritrea has not occupied any territory of Ethiopia, and we are
not willing to withdraw from our own territory,'' Woldetensae said.
	   That position is essentially unchanged from Eritrea's previous
stance. It was not immediately clear whether Ethiopia's minister,
who went into talks with the mediators half an hour after
Woldetensae left, would offer a new negotiating chip.

Portugual's Oliveira selected as new manager
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: PRECEDE Lisbon; UPDATES with confirmation. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SEVILLE, Spain (AP) _ Former Portuguese national team manager
Antonio Oliveira has agreed to end his short retirement and take
over Spanish club Real Betis at a reported annual salary of 150
million pesetas (about dlrs 1 million) for two years.
	   Betis president Manuel Ruiz de Lopera told a news conference
Saturday that he had selected Oliveira over many other coaches,
some of whom led World Cup teams in France last month.
	   ``In the end we decided to sign Oliveira, who comes in with a
lot of enthusiasm,'' Ruiz de Lopera said.
	   He did not mention a salary, but the Portuguese sports daily A
Bola reported earlier from Lisbon that Oliveira would get 150
million pesetas a year for two years.
	   Oliveira, 46, coached FC Oporto to its fourth consecutive
Portuguese league title last season and then announced he was
retiring for personal reasons.
	   As a player, Oliveira started the 1979-80 season with Betis but
scored only one goal _ on a penalty _ and left after 10 games.
	   Betis began its search for a new coach after Luis Aragones
resigned last week. The Spanish season starts Aug. 30.
	   The Seville club returned to the first division in 1994 and
finished fourth last season to qualify for the UEFA Cup.
	   Brazilian midfielder Denilson is due to join Spanish
international Alfonso Perez and Nigeria's Finidi George on Betis
for the upcoming season.
	   Denilson's transfer cost Betis a record 5.3 billion pesetas
(dlrs 35 million), the most expensive in Spanish soccer history.

In Europe's gay capital, the carefree paint the town pink

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ They're painting the town pink.
	   Clad in everything from wedding veils to leather G-strings, tens
of thousands of homosexuals from 66 countries partied in the
cobblestone streets of Amsterdam as the week-long Gay Games got
under way Saturday.
	   But here in Europe's self-styled homosexual capital _ where gays
and lesbians can marry, are welcomed in the military and are close
to winning adoption rights _ not even the bare-chested men with
nipple jewelry rollerblading through town were drawing many stares.
	   ``We're used to it,'' Andre Bakker said with a shrug as he and
his wife, Florence, craned their necks for a glimpse of a dozen men
in Dutch milkmaid outfits dancing on a passing canal boat.
	   Founded in San Francisco in 1982 as a gay alternative to the
Olympics, the fifth quadrennial sports and cultural festival opened
amid clear signs that it has come of age.
	   Organizers said more than 200,000 visitors were in the Dutch
capital for the games, which run through Aug. 8 and will bring
together 15,000 competitors _ half as many as in the mainstream
Olympics.
	   Organizers will be handing out medals here for such ``sports''
as ballroom dancing and oil wrestling. A small fringe group of were
running their own ``Queer Do-It-Yourself Games,'' featuring
purse-tossing and a 200-meter dash in high heels.
	   The famously open-minded Dutch, thousands of whom lined the
medieval canals Saturday to wildly cheer on a Gay Games parade of
boatloads of transvestites, have rolled out the pink carpet.
	   ``We've certainly made enormous gains in this country, and above
all in this city,'' said Rene Zuidervelt, the editor of Gay News
magazine.
	   ``It's not like that in other countries where homosexuals are
oppressed,'' he said. ``The Romanians and the Zimbabweans who
compete here can get a feeling of solidarity.''
	   Gays and lesbians have been progressively integrated into Dutch
culture over the past two decades. This year, lawmakers legalized
same sex civil marriage and are leaning toward granting homosexuals
the right to adopt children.
	   About 50,000 people, straight and gay alike, packed a soccer
stadium on the outskirts of Amsterdam for the opening ceremonies
under the theme ``Friendship Through Culture and Sport.''
	   ``Ladies and gentlemen, gays and lesbians, welcome to Amsterdam,
the `Gayway to Europe,''' an exuberant Mayor Schelto Patijn told
the roaring crowd.
	   The crowd cheered as the delegations marched in, the Japanese
team wearing traditional kimono, athletes from rainy Holland
holding aloft rainbow-colored umbrellas. Men in sailor's outfits
danced to rave music.
	   ``Many of us have competed in an environment where we have had
to hide a valuable part of ourselves. One by one we have faced
these fears,'' tennis star Martina Navratilova told the crowd over
via a satellite hookup and giant TV screens.
	   The main event was a concert by Dana International, the Israeli
transsexual pop star who gained notoriety and angered orthodox

	   Even so, the 1998 games aren't without controversy. On Saturday,
the European Gay and Lesbian Sports Federation called on athletes

Amsterdam.

southern hemisphere Gay Games in 2002.

Arab League slams UN for refusing permission to fly to Libya
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The United Nations's refusal to allow the
Arab League Secretary-General to fly to Libya was ``authoritarian
and stubborn,'' the League said Saturday.
	   Secretary-General Esmet Abdel-Meguid had requested permission
Tuesday to fly to Libya for talks with Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi on the recent U.S.-British discussions on holding the trial
for the two alleged Lockerbie bombers in the Netherlands.
	   But the U.N. committee which monitors the air sanctions imposed
on Libya turned the request down on Thursday.
	   The U.N. Security Council imposed the sanctions in 1992 in a bid
to force Libya to hand over the two Libyans accused of planting a
bomb on an American airliner that killed 270 when it blew up over
the Scottish town of Lockerbie in 1988.
	   ``The request to the ... U.N. sanctions committee was out of the
Arab League's respect for international resolutions,'' the League
said in a statement from its Cairo headquarters.
	   ``But the objection of the United States and Britain on the
committee shows that the sanctions are undoubtedly interpreted in
an authoritarian and stubborn way,'' the League said.
	   The League said Abdel Meguid would head for Libya on Sunday. It
did not say how he would travel, but it is unlikely that Egypt
would allow him to cross into Libya by air.
	   Last month, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak flew to Libya with
a medical team after receiving permission from the sanctions
committee to see Gadhafi after he had an operation on his hip.
	   The U.N. allows flights to and from Libya for humanitarian and
religious reasons.
	   But the presidents of Chad, Niger and Burkina Faso flew to Libya
last month to see Gadhafi in breach of the sanctions.
	   Libya has refused to hand over the Lockerbie suspects, arguing
they would not receive a fair trial in the United States or
Scotland.
	   Last month British and U.S. officials said they were examining
the possibility of allowing the trial to proceed in a third
country, such as the Netherlands, under Scottish law. Libya has
long suggested such a venue.

Spain shows leniency for pregnant Moroccan immigrant

Saturday &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A Moroccan teenager who braved the Strait
of Gibraltar at night in an overcrowded boat even though she's
eight months pregnant will be allowed to have her baby in Spain,
officials say.
	   The girl, identified only as Fatima, 19, was picked up at sea as
she and 14 other North Africans tried to reach Spain in a
dilapidated single-engine boat overnight Wednesday.
	   They were just a half-mile (kilometer) from their destination,
the town of La Linea, when a Civil Guard patrol boat spotted them.
	   The would-be immigrants told authorities they had paid as much
as half a million pesetas (3,300 dollars) to a Spaniard to get them
across the Strait from Ceuta, a tiny Spanish enclave on the
Moroccan coast.
	   Fatima said she was trying to join her husband, who'd made it to
Spain the same way and was looking for work.
	   She was taken to a hospital in the town of Algeciras and given a
checkup. Doctors said she was fine, and scheduled another
appointment for August 28, the newspaper El Mundo reported.
	   Spanish officials could not be reached for comment.
	   Normally Fatima would be repatriated immediately along with the
other 14 who wanted to reach Europe.
	   But deputy labor minister Manuel Pimentel visited her in the
hospital Friday and said that until the baby is born she can stay
in a shelter for immigrants.
	   After that, a humanitarian group which has taken up her case,
Algeciras Shelters, has a month to apply for a residence permit for
her.
	   Every year thousands of North Africans fleeing poverty attempt
to cross the Strait of Gibraltar, often in flimsy, overcrowded
boats. The trip is sometimes deadly. Last weekend a boat carrying
27 people from Morocco capsized, killing all but seven.
	   The Civil Guard stopped another boat Saturday afternoon, this
time a 20-footer carrying 24 Moroccan men, as it approached the
southern port of Almeria, the state-run news agency EFE said.
	   Seven were hospitalized for exposure to the sun, it said.
	   Spain is a favored point of entry because the stretch of sea
separating it from Africa is only 15 kilometers (nine miles) wide
in some places.

10 cases of hemorrhagic dengue reported in northern Mexican state
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Ten cases of hemorrhagic dengue fever have
been reported this year in the northern Mexican state of Nuevo
Leon, prompting a campaign to purify area water supplies, a state
health official said Saturday.
	   The number of cases is up sharply from 1997, when only six cases
were reported for the year, Nuevo Leon's deputy secretary of
health, Jesus Zacarias Villareal, told the government news agency
Notimex.
	   Hemorrhagic dengue, a particularly devastating form of the
dengue disease, is characterized by severe muscle pain, skin
lesions, internal bleeding and sometimes death.
	   State authorities began a campaign this month to purify water
supplies, including the fumigation of water reservoirs to prevent
reproduction of the Aedes Aegypti mosquito, which carries the
disease.
	   Families in the northern border state are being urged to make
sure their home water supplies are clean, Zacarias Villareal said.

Daly breaks a club, walks off and is disqualified
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEMPHIS, Tennessee (AP) _ John Daly, renowned for his temper
tantrums, had another outburst at the St. Jude Classic Saturday.
	   Daly was 3-under-par on the front nine, before double-bogeying
three holes on the back side, including the last two. He walked off
the course without signing a scorecard and was disqualified.
	   Daly pulled a 5-iron out of bounds at the par-4 17th hole, took
a drop, and hit the same club over the green _ then broke the club.
	   At No. 18 Daly hit his drive into the lake on the left of the
fairway and took his third double bogey of the round, finishing
with a 74.
	   He exchanged scorecards with Loren Roberts, then walked past the
scorers' tent and away from the course without stopping to talk to
anyone.

Forecasters say Alex is barely a tropical storm
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS with plane examining Alex; UPDATES with location and
wind strength of storms at 2100 GMT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ A reconnaissance plane sent out to have a look at
Tropical Storm Alex found sustained winds near 50 mph (80 kph),
forecasters at the National Hurricane Center said Saturday.
	   At 2100 GMT Saturday, the storm was about 290 miles (470
kilometers) east northeast of the Leeward Islands, moving
west-northwest at about 15 mph (24 kph). It was near 18 degrees 1
minute north latitude and 56 degrees 2 minutes west longitude.
	   Meanwhile, Hurricane Estelle gained strength far off the Mexican
Pacific coast on Saturday, posing little risk to land but bringing
light rain to western Mexico.
	   The U.S. Hurricane Center in Miami said Estelle was located
about 610 miles (980 kilometers) southwest of the tip of the Baja
California Peninsula and moving west at 15 mph (24 kph). The storm
was churning maximum sustained winds of 115 mph (185 kph), the
center said.
	   Estelle was expected to continue gaining strength over the next
day or so, until it moves over cooler waters, the center said.
	   If Alex follows its course, it will be passing north of the
Leeward Islands on Sunday, with most of the showers and gusty winds
over the open Atlantic Ocean.
	   A ship in the area reported gusts of near hurricane force about
150 miles (240 kilometers) north of the storm's center.
	   Little change was expected in Alex's strength. Meanwhile, a
large tropical wave in the central tropical Atlantic Ocean was
moving westward at 15 mph (24 kph).
	   Slow development of the system was possible during the next day
or two, forecasters said.

Palestinians: Talks a ``waste of time.''
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RELEADS to UPDATE throughout with new details from Palestinian
cabinet meeting, official Israeli reaction, fresh comments &QL; 
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Declaring recently resumed talks
with Israel a ``waste of time,'' the Palestinians called on the
international community Saturday to pressure Israel into making
progress on the crumbling peace talks.
	   ``The meetings that have taken place over the last two weeks
were a complete waste of time,'' said a Palestinian Cabinet
statement. ``The Palestinian leadership decided to send letters to
the co-sponsors (of the peace process) and to the world community
asking them to intervene,'' said the statement issued to reporters.
	   Following the Palestinian Cabinet meeting late Saturday,
Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath said the Palestinians
had done their part in making the talks productive but achieved no
progress.
	   Shaath said contacts would be cut off unless Israel accepts a
U.S. initiative which calls for it to withdraw from 13 percent of
the West Bank. The Palestinians have already agreed to the plan.
	   ``We gave these negotiations our utmost attention,'' Shaath
said, ``But I'm sorry to say that until now absolutely no progress
has been made.''
	   However, Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel insisted the
sides have advanced and said talks are expected to continue in the
coming days.
	   ``If there is a willingness on the part of the Palestinians to
reach an agreement we will be able to do so within a relatively
short period of time,'' Fogel told The Associated Press.
	   Earlier Saturday, Shaath told reporters in the Gaza Strip that
the talks would end in ``two, three or four days ... unless the
Israelis come up with a miracle and declare their acceptance of the
American initiative and are ready to withdraw.''
	   ``Until now, we have nothing to indicate that Israel is ready to
accept the American initiative,'' Shaath said upon returning to
Gaza from a six-day trip to Austria, Morocco and Turkey with
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat.
	   Differing accounts of the success of the talks has been a
constant refrain between the two sides.
	   Arafat said Saturday that despite the talks over the past two
weeks, ``Everything is still frozen.''
	   Asked what the next step would be he said only, ``We have to
wait and see.''
	   Shaath said the Palestinians had agreed to the meetings with
Israeli negotiators at the request of U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright.
	   ``We knew that the chances were slim but we sat and listened to
not give an excuse,'' he said. ``We tried and listened attentively
and received nothing from Israel. So the responsibility is in
Albright's hands.''
	   Shaath said he hoped the United States would put real pressure
on Israel ``to push things forward.''
	   After meeting with chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat in
Cairo Saturday, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Israel
was not taking the talks seriously.
	   ``The Palestinians have informed us,'' Moussa said, ``(that) the
Israelis were not speaking with any seriousness and did not put
forth any new suggestions.''
	   Negotiations broke down 16 months ago. For the past two weeks,
the two sides have been holding direct talks in an effort to mo0ve
the process ahead but with little success.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has refused to accept an
American proposal for a 13 percent withdrawal, accompanied by
Palestinian moves to increase security. The Palestinians have
accepted the proposal.
	   After months of unsuccessful shuttle diplomacy, the United
States said it was time for the two sides to work out their
differences themselves.
	   Meanwhile, Israel eased restrictions on Palestinian transport of
supplies between Israel and the West Bank for the first time in
three years. Shlomo Dror, spokesman for Israel's liaison office
with the Palestinians said 100 supply trucks would now be able to
travel Israeli controlled-roads.

Burton takes 3-stroke lead into final round of du Maurier
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW with Saturday's round. &QL; 
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WINDSOR, Ontario (AP) _ Brandie Burton stormed out of the pack
with birdies on four of the last six holes Saturday for a
6-under-par 66 that gave her a three-stroke lead going into the
final round du Maurier Classic.
	   Burton, just 21 when she won the du Maurier in 1993, set a
54-hole tournament record of 18-under 198. The previous mark was
200 by Japan's Ayako Okamoto in 1987.
	   She will be in the final pairing Sunday with Meg Mallon, another
American and a former U.S. LPGA Championship and U.S. Open winner,
who had a 5-under 67 and a share of the lead three times in the
third round until Burton pulled away.
	   ``My putter has been very nice to the last three days,'' Burton
said. ``I just need it to hold on for 18 more holes.''
	   It will have to. Those trying to chase her down at Essex Golf
and Country Club have all proved they can handle the pressure of
the final round of a major championship.
	   Sweden's Annika Sorenstam, playing her best in a major since
winning her second straight U.S. Open in 1996, is tied with Mallon
at 201. Americans Pat Hurst, who won the year's first major at the
Dinah Shore, and Betsy King, who needs to win the du Maurier to
complete the women's grand slam, were five strokes back at 203.
	   ``You want to beat the best in the world, and the best are
here,'' Mallon said. ``It's much more gratifying to win a
tournament that way.''
	   Sorenstam also shot a 67 despite missing five birdie putts
inside 4 1-2 meters (15 feet), including one at No. 18 that would
have put her in the final pairing.
	   ``It's going to be quite a shootout,'' Sorenstam said. ``I've
just got to put it in the highest gear I've got.''
	   South Korea's Se Ri Pak keeps shifting down, utterly worn out
from playing six straight tournaments and trying to deal with the
media attention over her bid to become the first rookie to win
three majors in one year.
	   ``I think she's at the point about to break down,'' said her
manager, Steven Kil.
	   Rubbing her sore left shoulder throughout another gorgeous
Canadian summer day, Pak missed five of her first seven fairways on
her way to a 1-under 71 that left her 12 strokes back.
	   She spoke briefly to Korean reporters, then hustled off into the
locker room.
	   ``My shots are not consistent,'' Pak said. ``I tried to do my
best. I'm proud of that. One more day to go. Anything can happen.
Since it's the last round, I'll be a little more aggressive.''

Burton takes 3-stroke lead into final round of du Maurier
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS to show Sorenstam paired with Burton; edits to
conform &QL; 
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WINDSOR, Ontario (AP) _ Brandie Burton stormed out of the pack
with birdies on four of the last six holes Saturday for a
6-under-par 66 that gave her a three-stroke lead going into the
final round of the du Maurier Classic.
	   Burton, just 21 when she won the du Maurier in 1993, set a
54-hole tournament record of 18-under 198. The previous mark was
200 by Japan's Ayako Okamoto in 1987.
	   She will be in the final pairing Sunday with Sweden's Annika
Sorenstam, who had a 5-under 67 and is playing her best in a major
since winning her second straight U.S. Women's Open in 1996.
	   ``My putter has been very nice to the last three days,'' Burton
said. ``I just need it to hold on for 18 more holes.''
	   It will have to. Those trying to chase her down at Essex Golf
and Country Club have all proved they can handle the pressure of
the final round of a major championship.
	   Meg Mallon, another American and a former U.S. LPGA Championship
and U.S. Open winner, also had a 67 and is tied with Sorenstam at
201. Americans Pat Hurst, who won the year's first major at the
Dinah Shore, and Betsy King, who needs to win the du Maurier to
complete the women's grand slam, were five strokes back at 203.
	   ``You want to beat the best in the world, and the best are here.
It's much more gratifying to win a tournament that way,'' said
Mallon, who had a share of the lead three times in the third round
before Burton pulled away.
	   ``It's going to be quite a shootout,'' Sorenstam said. ``I've
just got to put it in the highest gear I've got.''
	   South Korea's Se Ri Pak keeps shifting down, utterly worn out
from playing six straight tournaments and trying to deal with the
media attention over her bid to become the first rookie to win
three majors in one year.
	   ``I think she's at the point about to break down,'' said her
manager, Steven Kil.
	   Rubbing her sore left shoulder throughout another gorgeous
Canadian summer day, Pak missed five of her first seven fairways on
her way to a 1-under 71 that left her 12 strokes back.
	   She spoke briefly to Korean reporters, then hustled off into the
locker room.
	   ``My shots are not consistent,'' Pak said. ``I tried to do my
best. I'm proud of that. One more day to go. Anything can happen.
Since it's the last round, I'll be a little more aggressive.''

Palestinians: Talks a ``waste of time.''
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RELEADS to UPDATE throughout with new details from Palestinian
cabinet meeting, official Israeli reaction, fresh comments. TRIMS. &QL; 
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Declaring recently resumed talks
with Israel a ``waste of time,'' the Palestinians called on the
international community Saturday to pressure Israel into making
progress on the crumbling peace talks.
	   ``The meetings that have taken place over the last two weeks
were a complete waste of time,'' said a Palestinian Cabinet
statement. ``The Palestinian leadership decided to send letters to
the co-sponsors (of the peace process) and to the world community
asking them to intervene,'' said the statement issued to reporters.
	   Following the Palestinian Cabinet meeting late Saturday,
Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath said the Palestinians
had done their part in making the talks productive but achieved no
progress.
	   Shaath said contacts would be cut off unless Israel accepts a
U.S. initiative which calls for it to withdraw from 13 percent of
the West Bank. The Palestinians have already agreed to the plan.
	   ``We gave these negotiations our utmost attention,'' Shaath
said, ``But I'm sorry to say that until now absolutely no progress
has been made.''
	   However, Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel insisted the
sides have advanced and said talks are expected to continue in the
coming days.
	   ``If there is a willingness on the part of the Palestinians to
reach an agreement we will be able to do so within a relatively
short period of time,'' Fogel told The Associated Press.
	   Differing accounts of the success of the talks has been a
constant refrain between the two sides.
	   Shaath said the Palestinians had agreed to the meetings with
Israeli negotiators at the request of U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright.
	   ``We knew that the chances were slim but we sat and listened to
not give an excuse,'' he said. ``We tried and listened attentively
and received nothing from Israel. So the responsibility is in
Albright's hands.''
	   Shaath said he hoped the United States would put real pressure
on Israel ``to push things forward.''
	   Negotiations broke down 16 months ago. For the past two weeks,
the two sides have been holding direct talks.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has refused to accept an
American proposal for a 13 percent withdrawal, accompanied by
Palestinian moves to increase security.
	   Meanwhile, Israel eased restrictions on Palestinian transport of
supplies between Israel and the West Bank for the first time in
three years. Shlomo Dror, spokesman for Israel's liaison office
with the Palestinians said 100 supply trucks would now be able to
travel Israeli controlled-roads.

Expelled Protestants return to Chiapas village
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Government authorities escorted 70
Protestants to their homes in a Chiapas village Saturday, one week
after they were expelled by local Catholics in a religious dispute.
	   The 15 men, 15 women and 40 children returned without incident
to Icalumtic, a village in the traditional Indian community of
Chamula, the government news agency Notimex reported.
	   The homecoming was made possible by an accord signed by
community leaders who agreed to respect the Protestants' religious
freedom as long as they agreed to cooperate with local traditions,
a state deputy secretary, Gustavo Moscoso Zenteno, told Notimex.
	   Chamula, just north of San Cristobal in southern Chiapas state,
is populated by Indians who have a deep attachment to Tzotzil Maya
tradition.
	   Over the past 25 years, thousands of people have been driven
from Chamula because they don't share the mix of Catholic and Maya
traditions of most Indians in the region.
	   The hybrid tradition includes such practices as the sipping of a
potent alcohol called posh during prayers in the township's only
permitted church.
	   Many Protestants and some Catholics object to local mandatory
taxes and duties to support religious festivals involving mass
drunkenness.
	   Critics also complain that town leaders' insistence on unity
extends to demands that all support the governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party.

Cuba rolls over Nicaragua, advances to final against SKorea
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs:UPDATES with late games &QL; 
 &UR; By VANIA GRANDI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Cuba rolled over Nicaragua 14-2 Saturday in the
semifinals of the World Baseball Championships, well on its way to
defending a title it has won 21 times.
	   Cuba meets South Korea Sunday for the championship game _ a
repeat of the 1994 final in Nicaragua, which Cuba won. If Cuba wins
again it will take home its sixth consecutive title.
	   Infielder Orestes Kindelan, 33, cracked a home run in the first
inning to give Cuba a jump start.
	   Danel Castro then smacked another homer in a six-run third
inning, and Kindelan repeated in the fifth to seal the match.
	   Starting pitcher Luis Lazo went the distance in a game halted
after the seventh inning because of the 10-run mercy rule. He
tossed a five-hitter and struck out five with balls that reached
speeds of 154 kph (96 mph).
	   Nicaragua appeared helpless against Cuba's pitching, scoring
only five hits the entire game. In past Worlds, Nicaragua has
collected five silver medals and three bronzes.
	   ``We never underestimate our opponents,'' Cuban manager Alfonso
Urquiola said. ``But now that the game is over I can say it was an
easy one.''
	   With the result, Cuba extended its winning streak at the Worlds
to 40 consecutive wins since 1986.
	   Starting pitcher Jang-Hee Park tossed a six-hitter and struck
out four to help South Korea trounce Italy 8-2. South Korea has
contested nine Worlds and taken home the gold once.
	   Italy, where baseball trails most other sports in popularity,
had never reached the semifinals prior to these championships.
	   The United States and Canada failed to advance past the
preliminary round.
	   Although this edition of the tournament is open to professionals
for the first time, no players from the major leagues are
participating.

Bomb explodes in Northern Ireland town
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with police saying 35 people treated for injuries,
comment from Mowlam &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ A car bomb exploded Saturday in
Banbridge, shattering shop windows in the center of the mostly
Protestant town, but no serious injuries were reported immediately.
	   Thirty-five people were treated for injuries at hospitals, and a
shopkeeper and a police officer were admitted for treatment, police
said.
	   No one immediately claimed responsibility, but police said there
had been a warning and the area was being cleared when the device
exploded outside a shoe store.
	   The blast damaged shops up and down Newry Street. The car, which
police said contained 500 pounds (225 kgs) of explosives, was a
blackened, twisted ruin.
	   ``Those responsible have no concern for the lives or livelihood
of people living in the town,'' said Britain's Northern Ireland
Secretary Mo Mowlam, who visited Saturday night.
	   ``Many people could have been killed or seriously injured by
this terrorist attack, and it is only through the speedy and
efficient action by the security forces that a tragedy has been
averted,'' Mowlam said.
	   Irish Republican Army dissidents opposed to the group's
cease-fire, operating as the ``Continuity IRA'' or ``real IRA,''
have carried out several bombings and attempts
	   Buildings in Banbridge, 22 miles (35 kms) southwest of Belfast,
suffered blast damage in April 1994 from a bomb hidden inside a
van. A police officer was hospitalized with leg injuries and
several elderly residents were treated for shock in that attack. No
one claimed responsibility.

Eritreans, Ethiopians refuse to budge in border talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES to add Ethiopian minister's comments after
emerging from talks. Edits to conform, trims. Changes overline. No

 &UR; By BRAHIMA OUEDRAOGO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ The foreign ministers of
Ethiopia and Eritrea on Saturday refused to budge in their bitter
frontier dispute after holding separate talks with African
mediators.
	   The feuding parties agreed to meet again Sunday with the
diplomats representing the Organization of African Unity in Burkina
Faso's capital of Ouagadougou.
	   Discussions with the mediators, led by OAU secretary-general
Salim Ahmed Salim, began more than 12 hours ahead of schedule,
prompting initial optimism by Burkina Faso officials about the
chances for a peace agreement.
	   Eritrea's Foreign Affairs Minister Haile Woldetensae and his
Ethiopian counterpart Seyoum Mesfin also voiced hopes for a
settlement, although both refused to compromise.
	   Woldetensae said his country was ready to meet face-to-face with
Ethiopia and formalize the end of fighting with a cease fire, but
was unprepared to withdraw from disputed land _ an Ethiopian
precondition for direct talks.
	   Fighting which flared in early May has subsided since mid-June,
following a U.S.-brokered deal to stop deadly air raids. Several
hundred people _ perhaps more _ perished before the fighting
subsided.
	   ``Eritrea has not occupied any territory of Ethiopia, and we are
not willing to withdraw from our own territory,'' Woldetensae said.
	   Seyoum, who met with the mediators after Woldetensae left,
repeated his country's demand for an Eritrean troop withdrawal.
	   The Ethiopian minister described his discussions with the OAU
mediators or ``contact group'' as positive and said he was hopeful
of a settlement.
	   Zimbabwe's Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge and his Djibouti
counterpart, Mohammed Musa Sheahim, were among the other mediators
taking part. Zimbabwe and Djibouti had hashed out a list of peace
proposals presented to the diplomats.
	   Burkina Faso officials had said that if the blueprints _ whose
details were not released _ were accepted by the feuding parties, a
peace agreement could be signed before the participants leave
Ouagadougou.
	   ``We are going to invite the two ministers (of Ethiopia and
Eritrea) to join us together when the time is ripe,'' Burkina
Faso's Foreign Minister Ablasse Ouedraogo said earlier in the day.
	   Although Ethiopia and Eritrea have steadfastly refused
face-to-face talks, the two foreign ministers shared the same plane
Saturday morning to this West African capital.
	   It was not clear whether the opponents made contact on the
flight, and they were quickly whisked away from Ouagadougou's
international airport to different hotels by Burkina Faso
diplomats.
	   Ethiopia says it was Eritrea's invasion of two districts on the
western end of the 960-kilometer (600-mile) border between the East
African countries that precipitated the crisis and subsequent
fighting.
	   Both countries have amassed troops along their border the
situation is at a stalemate.
	   Eritrea has called Ethiopia's saber-rattling a ``bluff'' to
maneuver the international community into pressuring Eritrea to
withdraw. The two countries were one until Eritrea won independence
in 1993.
	   As many as 100,000 people have been displaced by the fighting,
according to one U.N. estimate.

	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) _ Cuban President Fidel Castro laid a
wreath Saturday at a small granite obelisk bearing the names of 73
people who perished when a Cuban airliner was bombed out of the sky
off Barbados 22 years ago.
	   ``Everlasting glory to them! Cuba will never forget it!'' Castro
thundered to the applause of several hundred spectators at the
dedication ceremony.
	   The Oct. 6, 1976, bombing, blamed on anti-Castro activists,
killed 57 Cubans, including teen-age members of Cuba's national
fencing team, along with 11 Guyanese and five North Koreans.
Representatives of those two countries also laid wreaths at the
ceremony.
	   That act of ``criminal sabotage,'' Castro said Saturday, had
irrevocably linked Barbados with Cuba.
	   ``The blood of those who died as a consequence of that crime
forever tied the bonds of friendship and solidarity between the
Cuban people and the Barbadian people,'' Castro declared.
	   He praised the Cubana crew for trying to bring the damaged plane
home and he thanked Barbadians for their frantic efforts to find
survivors that sunny day 22 years ago. There were none.
	   Ultimately, four people were charged in Venezuela. Two were
convicted, while the others, who had ties to U.S.-based Cuban
exiles, were acquitted.
	   One of them, Luis Posada Carriles, recently claimed in
interviews with The New York Times that he was responsible for
hotel bombings in Havana last year, and that he was supported by
Cuban exiles in the United States.
	   Posada _ who denied involvement in the airliner bombing _ later
recanted. But Castro seized the opportunity to ask President
Clinton to crack down on U.S.-based Cuban exiles he accuses of
waging terrorism against his homeland.
	   At the ceremony, Castro blamed the bombing on ``agents trained
and controlled by the CIA,'' including Posada.
	   For a time, the bombing thrust Barbados, then just 10 years into
independence from Britain, into an international tug-of-war over
who should bring the alleged perpetrators to justice.
	   ``This made Barbados grow up very quickly. We were under
pressure to be either pro-U.S. or pro-Cuban,'' said Glenroy
Straughn, 71, a former member of Barbados' parliament who visited
the monument to gaze over its names.
	   Saturday's dedication was a highlight of Castro's visit to
Barbados, the second leg of a three-nation Caribbean goodwill tour.
In Jamaica, Castro won hearty support for his campaign to lift the
U.S. embargo of Cuba. On Sunday, he travels to Grenada, where U.S.
troops invaded in 1983 to oust hardline Marxists.
	   Before the dedication ceremony, several Cubana pilots and crew
members gathered at the memorial to read the names of those who
died. Some wept and hugged, and others took photographs of
themselves at the marker.
	   ``It's a very personal, intimate thing for Cubans,'' said Cubana
pilot Nelson Alvarez. ``Many people have suffered much.''
	   At dawn on Saturday, Castro, 71, led a 1,000-yard (900-meter)
public procession to a statue celebrating Barbadians' full
emancipation from slavery 160 years ago. He vowed to continue the
liberation struggle for his Caribbean neighbors.
	   ``Barbados and the Caribbean may trust Cuba the way a tree
trusts its own roots,'' Castro declared.
	   Walking up a slight incline at a steady pace, Castro and
Barbados Prime Minister Owen Arthur were surrounded by citizens
carrying hibiscus flowers and ginger lilies to place at the statue
of Bussa, leader of an 1816 slave revolt. In the throng, a trio of
Carnival celebrants walked on 10-foot-tall (3-meter-tall) stilts to
a gentle rhythm laid down by bandsmen playing drums and flute.
	   Arthur dedicated this year's Barbados Emancipation Day holiday
to the pan-African liberation struggle and thanked Castro for
Cuba's support in ending apartheid in South Africa.
	   Castro said the emancipation struggle continues _ especially in
the former European slave colonies of the Caribbean, whose
livelihood is threatened by such actions as a U.S. challenge in the
World Trade Organization to European incentives for bananas, a
lifeline for many Caribbean nations.
	   ``We believe it to be extremely unfair and selfish that through
the World Trade Organization, the Caribbean countries will be
deprived of their modest quotas in the banana market, just to
please the insatiable appetite of three or four powerful American
transnationals,'' he said to cheers.

	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) _ Cuban President Fidel Castro laid a
wreath Saturday at a small granite obelisk bearing the names of 73
people who perished when a Cuban airliner was bombed out of the sky
off Barbados 22 years ago.
	   ``Everlasting glory to them! Cuba will never forget it!'' Castro
thundered to the applause of several hundred spectators at the
dedication ceremony.
	   The Oct. 6, 1976, bombing, blamed on anti-Castro activists,
killed 57 Cubans, including teen-age members of Cuba's national
fencing team, along with 11 Guyanese and five North Koreans.
Representatives of those two countries also laid wreaths at the
ceremony.
	   That act of ``criminal sabotage,'' Castro said Saturday, had
irrevocably linked Barbados with Cuba.
	   ``The blood of those who died as a consequence of that crime
forever tied the bonds of friendship and solidarity between the
Cuban people and the Barbadian people,'' Castro declared.
	   He praised the Cubana crew for trying to bring the damaged plane
home and he thanked Barbadians for their frantic efforts to find
survivors that sunny day 22 years ago. There were none.
	   Ultimately, four people were charged in Venezuela. Two were
convicted, while the others, who had ties to U.S.-based Cuban
exiles, were acquitted.
	   One of them, Luis Posada Carriles, recently claimed in
interviews with The New York Times that he was responsible for
hotel bombings in Havana last year, and that he was supported by
Cuban exiles in the United States.
	   Posada _ who denied involvement in the airliner bombing _ later
recanted. But Castro seized the opportunity to ask President
Clinton to crack down on U.S.-based Cuban exiles he accuses of
waging terrorism against his homeland.
	   At the ceremony, Castro blamed the bombing on ``agents trained
and controlled by the CIA,'' including Posada.
	   For a time, the bombing thrust Barbados, then just 10 years into
independence from Britain, into an international tug-of-war over
who should bring the alleged perpetrators to justice.
	   ``This made Barbados grow up very quickly. We were under
pressure to be either pro-U.S. or pro-Cuban,'' said Glenroy
Straughn, 71, a former member of Barbados' parliament who visited
the monument to gaze over its names.
	   Saturday's dedication was a highlight of Castro's visit to
Barbados, the second leg of a three-nation Caribbean goodwill tour.
In Jamaica, Castro won hearty support for his campaign to lift the
U.S. embargo of Cuba. On Sunday, he travels to Grenada, where U.S.
troops invaded in 1983 to oust hardline Marxists.
	   Before the dedication ceremony, several Cubana pilots and crew
members gathered at the memorial to read the names of those who
died. Some wept and hugged, and others took photographs of
themselves at the marker.
	   ``It's a very personal, intimate thing for Cubans,'' said Cubana
pilot Nelson Alvarez. ``Many people have suffered much.''
	   At dawn on Saturday, Castro, 71, led a 1,000-yard (900-meter)
public procession to a statue celebrating Barbadians' full
emancipation from slavery 160 years ago. He vowed to continue the
liberation struggle for his Caribbean neighbors.
	   ``Barbados and the Caribbean may trust Cuba the way a tree
trusts its own roots,'' Castro declared.
	   Walking up a slight incline at a steady pace, Castro and
Barbados Prime Minister Owen Arthur were surrounded by citizens
carrying hibiscus flowers and ginger lilies to place at the statue
of Bussa, leader of an 1816 slave revolt. In the throng, a trio of
Carnival celebrants walked on 10-foot-tall (3-meter-tall) stilts to
a gentle rhythm laid down by bandsmen playing drums and flute.
	   Arthur dedicated this year's Barbados Emancipation Day holiday
to the pan-African liberation struggle and thanked Castro for
Cuba's support in ending apartheid in South Africa.
	   Castro said the emancipation struggle continues _ especially in
the former European slave colonies of the Caribbean, whose
livelihood is threatened by such actions as a U.S. challenge in the
World Trade Organization to European incentives for bananas, a
lifeline for many Caribbean nations.
	   ``We believe it to be extremely unfair and selfish that through
the World Trade Organization, the Caribbean countries will be
deprived of their modest quotas in the banana market, just to
please the insatiable appetite of three or four powerful American
transnationals,'' he said to cheers.

	   SAN JUAN CHAMULA, Mexico (AP) _ Government officials escorted 70
Protestants to their homes in a Chiapas village Saturday, one week
after they were expelled by local Catholics in a religious dispute.
	   The 15 men, 15 women and 40 children returned peacefully to
Icalumtic, a village in the traditional Indian community of San
Juan Chamula. Local Catholics, however, said they did not approve
of the return and some Protestants expressed concern for their
safety.
	   ``It was irresponsible of the authorities and of our leaders to
betray us and leave us alone without protection,'' Mateo Gonzalez,
a spokesman for the Protestants, said.
	   Carrying their few belongings in their hands, the Protestant
families returned to their modest homes, where dogs and chickens
wandered the yards.
	   San Juan Chamula, just north of San Cristobal in southern
Chiapas state, is populated by Indians who have a deep attachment
to Tzotzil Maya tradition.
	   The July 29 expulsions were the latest in a 25-year conflict
that has seen thousands of people driven from San Juan Chamula
because they don't share the mix of Catholic and Maya traditions of
most Indians in the region.
	   The hybrid tradition includes such practices as the sipping of a
potent alcohol called posh during prayers in the township's only
permitted church.
	   Many Protestants and some Catholics object to local mandatory
taxes and duties to support religious festivals involving mass
drunkenness.
	   Critics also complain that town leaders' insistence on unity
extends to demands that all support the governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party.
	   Gustavo Moscoso Zenteno, a state deputy secretary, said the
homecoming was made possible because Catholic community leaders had
agreed to respect the Protestants' religious freedom as long as
they agreed to cooperate with local traditions.
	   But dozens of Catholics who gathered at the local school said
they were surprised by the return, saying it happened without their
consent. Some asserted that they would not accept the Protestant
presence in their village.

Australians deny 1-2 matchup for gold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: NEW with Saturday's semifinals. &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM O'CONNELL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Kerri Pottharst and Pauline Manser of Australia
upset second-seeded Americans Holly McPeak and Lisa Arce 12-11,
11-12, 12-6 on Saturday to reach the women's beach volleyball final
at the Goodwill Games.
	   They will face top-seeded Shelda Bede and Adriana Behar of
Brazil, who lived up to their ranking with a 12-5, 12-7 semifinal
win over Laura Bruschini and Annamaria Solazzi of Italy.
	   It was a huge win for Pottharst and Manser, who are playing
their first year together, and their second over a U.S. team on
home sand. They beat Karolyn Kirby and Liz Masakayan in the opening
game of pool play.
	   ``One of the things we wanted with today's game was to make a
statement,'' said Pottharst, who combined with Natalie Cook to win
the bronze medal at the Atlanta Olympics. ``We started this season
together with a second in Brazil and we're extremely happy with our
new partnership. We're still learning.''
	   McPeak and Arce have won three international tournaments and
finished second in last year's world championship. They put
together an impressive rally from 10-3 down to win the second set,
but never were really in the decisive set, which was played under
rally rules _ a point on every serve.
	   ``We were fine,'' McPeak said of facing a third set after the
big comeback. ``We had the momentum after the second game but then
we sat down for five minutes and it was a little difficult to keep
it going. We wanted to come right out scoring in the rally and we
didn't.''
	   The U.S. team led 3-2 in the third set, but the Australians took
the lead for good with the next three points, then closed out the
match by scoring the last five points.
	   This was the first match of either the men's or women's
competition to go to the deciding set.
	   ``We don't have the experience of playing rally scoring much,''
Arce said. ``It's a good mental game and your serve has to be on
along with the pressure of not making any errors. It makes it more
exciting but it's tough to prepare for.''
	   The Brazilians, like McPeak and Arce, went unbeaten in pool
play, including a 15-9 victory over Pottharst and Manser, the
Australians' only loss.
	   Bede was obviously bothered by a left knee injury against Italy
and she was going to see a doctor Saturday night.
	   ``Everyone could see she is feeling pain and not running so
fast,'' Behar said.
	   The Brazilians were surprised with their opponent in Sunday's
gold-medal match, a team they beat in a final earlier this year.
	   ``We know Australia is a good team and they are very strong,''
Behar said. ``We would have liked to play Holly and Lisa because we
are good friends and it would have been fun to play them. But in
beach volleyball, someone has to lose and someone has to win. It
was a surprise but it was also normal.''

<TEXT>
	   MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) _ John Daly, renowned for his tantrums, had
another outburst at the St. Jude Classic on Saturday.
	   Daly was 3-under-par on the front nine, before double-bogeying
three holes on the back side, including the last two. He walked off
the course without signing a scorecard and was disqualified.
	   Daly pulled a 5-iron shot out of bounds at the par-4 17th hole,
took a drop, and hit the same club over the green _ then broke the
club.
	   On No. 18 Daly hit his drive into the rough near the lake left
of the fairway, hacked out and took his third double bogey of the
round, finishing with 74.
	   He exchanged scorecards with Loren Roberts, then walked past the
scorers' tent and away from the course without stopping to talk to
anyone.

Agassi beats Gimelstob for 10th straight win
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: NEW with Saturday's first semifinal; Will be UPDATED after
Henman-Raoux semifinal beginning 0230 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By BETH HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Andre Agassi cranked up his famed return of
serve to beat Justin Gimelstob 6-0, 7-6 (7-2) in Saturday's
Mercedes Cup semifinals for his 10th consecutive victory without
dropping a set.
	   Agassi, the fifth seed, advanced to the final here for the first
time since 1988. He'll face either No. 2 seed Tim Henman of Britain
or Frenchman Guillaume Raoux, who met in the night semifinal.
	   ``It's not about winning to me at the moment,'' Agassi said.
``It's about execution and dedicating myself to my goals day after
day.''
	   Agassi raced through the first set in 22 minutes under a
cloudless sky and blazing sun on the UCLA campus, where Gimelstob
won the the U.S. college doubles title for UCLA before turning pro
in 1996.
	   After surprising top-seeded Patrick Rafter 6-4, 6-3 in Friday's
quarterfinals, Gimelstob proclaimed, ``This is my house.''
	   On Saturday, he conceded that Agassi had invaded.
	   ``It's still my place,'' Gimelstob said, ``but he can lease it
from me this year.''
	   Last year, Gimelstob shocked Agassi 7-5, 6-2 in the first round
here for his biggest victory as a pro. Ranked 98th in the world,
Gimelstob topped that by sending Rafter home Friday.
	   ``In every single department, I'm a better player than I was
last year,'' said Agassi, currently ranked 13th by the ATP Tour. He
was 32nd at this time last year and headed to a low of 122nd by
year's end.
	   He showed his improvement in the first set, breaking the
1.96-meter (6-foot-5) Gimelstob three times with laser-like returns
of the second-year pro's big serves. Gimelstob's major weapon
failed him most of the time, including a double-fault on triple
break point to trail 0-5.
	   ``I was really struggling to see on one side of the court,''
said Gimelstob, bothered by serving into the sun. ``I didn't come
out firing at the beginning of the match. He's going to make you
hit winners.''
	   During the first changeover of the second set, both players had
their coaches on court to talk strategy as part of a
five-tournament ATP Tour experiment. What did Brad Gilbert tell
Agassi?
	   ``He says, `Ditto. Do that one more time,''' Agassi said of his
easy first set. ``Brad knows a 6-0 set is sometimes the worst thing
that can happen to you because it conditions you to think things
are going to be easy.''
	   Gimelstob made it tougher in the second set, cutting back on his
errors as neither player broke serve en route to the tiebreaker.
	   Agassi moved to a quick 4-0 in the breaker when he hit a
backhand passing shot and Gimelstob committed three straight
errors. He netted a forehand on match point.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   LIKOVAC, Yugoslavia _ Serbian forces attacked and burned
villages Saturday in troubled Kosovo province, despite an official
pledge that their offensive was over. The fighting added to a flood
of displaced and destitute people fleeing their homes. On Thursday,
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic told a European Union
delegation that an eight-day Serb offensive against the Kosovo
Liberation Army had ended. But he refused to pull police and the
federal army from the province, a key demand by ethnic Albanians
before negotiations can start on a peaceful settlement of the
conflict that has killed hundreds of people, including many
children. In Likovac, a stronghold of the Kosovo Liberation Army in
the northwestern Drenica area, a high-ranking KLA commander said
Serb police had launched a new offensive Saturday against a cluster
of 13 villages. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados _ Cuban President Fidel Castro laid a
wreath Saturday at a small granite obelisk bearing the names of 73
people who perished when a Cuban airliner was bombed out of the sky
off Barbados 22 years ago. ``Everlasting glory to them! Cuba will
never forget it!'' Castro thundered to the applause of several
hundred spectators at the dedication ceremony. The Oct. 6, 1976,
bombing, blamed on anti-Castro activists, killed 57 Cubans,
including teen-age members of Cuba's national fencing team, along
with 11 Guyanese and five North Koreans. Representatives of those
two countries also laid wreaths at the ceremony. That act of
``criminal sabotage,'' Castro said Saturday, had irrevocably linked
Barbados with Cuba. (CARIBBEAN-CASTRO)
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso _ The foreign ministers of Ethiopia
and Eritrea on Saturday refused to budge in their bitter frontier
dispute after holding separate talks with African mediators. The
feuding parties agreed to meet again Sunday with the diplomats
representing the Organization of African Unity in Burkina Faso's
capital of Ouagadougou. Discussions with the mediators, led by OAU
secretary-general Salim Ahmed Salim, began more than 12 hours ahead
of schedule, prompting initial optimism by Burkina Faso officials
about the chances for a peace agreement. Eritrea's Foreign Affairs
Minister Haile Woldetensae and his Ethiopian counterpart Seyoum
Mesfin also voiced hopes for a settlement, although both refused to
compromise. (OAU-ETHIOPIA-ERITREA)
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip _ Declaring recently resumed talks with
Israel a ``waste of time,'' the Palestinians called on the
international community Saturday to pressure Israel into making
progress on the crumbling peace talks. ``The meetings that have
taken place over the last two weeks were a complete waste of
time,'' said a Palestinian Cabinet statement. ``The Palestinian
leadership decided to send letters to the co-sponsors (of the peace
process) and to the world community asking them to intervene,''
said the statement issued to reporters. Following the Palestinian
Cabinet meeting late Saturday, Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil
Shaath said the Palestinians had done their part in making the
talks productive but achieved no progress. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   BOGOTA, Colombia _ Ten soldiers are being investigated in
connection with a paramilitary massacre in central Colombia. Nine
soldiers allegedly waved the gunmen through an army checkpoint on
their way to and from the killings and at least one may have
participated in the attack. The investigation by representatives of
the Attorney General's office and Federal Prosecutor's office was
announced Friday. The incident occurred May 16 in Barrancabermeja,
165 miles (265 kilometers) northeast of the capital, Bogota, when
50 right-wing paramilitary gunmen stormed into a residential
neighborhood and killed seven people. The Self-Defense Forces of
Santander and Southern Cesar, which claimed responsibility for the
attack, said it kidnapped 25 others, then executed them for alleged
rebel activity. The group says it incinerated the bodies, which
have never been found. (COLOMBIA-MASSACRE)

	   SAG HARBOR, New York (AP) _ Christie Brinkley can still stop
traffic _ even if it's the presidential motorcade.
	   The supermodel walked outside her home Saturday to join others
waving at President Bill Clinton while he passed through the area.
	   ``The president was waving at everybody, and then he saw
Christie. You could see him mouth to his driver, `Stop, it's
Christie,''' said Brinkley's husband, architect Peter Cook.
	   Clinton, who is on a three-day fund-raising trip on Long
Island's East End, hopped out of the car and greeted Brinkley, 43,
and her family, Cook said.
	   They exchanged pleasantries in the middle of the street,
including how Clinton's golf game went earlier in the day.
	   ``He looked relaxed. He looked like he got a little sun,'' Cook
said.
	   Clinton left when the crowd started to swell _ but not before
posing for pictures with Brinkley and 1-month-old Sailor Lee
Brinkley Cook.
	   ``That was our baby's first photo-op,'' Cook said.

	   ROCHESTER, Minnesota (AP) _ Florists near the Mayo Clinic love
Jordan's King Hussein almost as much as the supporters flooding
them with orders for get-well floral bouquets.
	   The king has been hospitalized at the Mayo Clinic since July 14
for chemotherapy treatments for non-Hodgkins lymphoma.
	   Several florists said they have filled more orders for Hussein
than for any other Mayo patient, including former first lady
Barbara Bush, who was at the clinic in 1996 and 1997 for hip
surgeries.
	   ``We're getting about three to four orders a day,'' said Kevin
Patton, owner of Whiting's Flowers and Greenhouse.
	   Hussein's favorite flower is the black iris, a rare flower that
blooms naturally only in the fall. His arrangements have cost dlrs
100 to dlrs 1,500.
	   ``All flower arrangements for the king have to go through
security and be X-rayed,'' Patton said.
	   Most arrangements go to Hussein's suite, then are distributed
throughout the clinic and hospital, a Mayo spokeswoman said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ELLESMERE PORT, England (AP) _ Hold the fries _ Queen Elizabeth
II stopped in at a McDonald's for a chat and a photo opportunity.
	   ``The people longed for a less remote monarch: yesterday they
met her,'' a headline proclaimed today in The Times of London. The
front-page story ran with a big photo of Her Majesty walking toward
the golden arches Friday.
	   After mingling at McDonald's, where she passed on the burgers,
the queen did some window-shopping at an outlet village, having a
look at kitchenware and shoes.
	   Surveys have found people regard the monarch as too remote, and
the queen of late has made a point of showing a common touch,
including a trip to a supermarket.
	   ``I couldn't have imagined the queen driving through a burger
bar a few years ago,'' said Jean Reynolds, 54, of Liverpool, who
was among the crowd welcoming the queen.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) _ Jerry Seinfeld was giving tickets away
again.
	   Like he did in Nebraska, Seinfeld assured himself of full houses
at four weekend shows in Iowa by making tickets free. The Des
Moines shows wrapped up Seinfeld's international comedy tour before
his highly touted Broadway show starting Aug. 9.
	   The comedian who ended his popular sitcom this year praised Iowa
audiences for being on the spot for the sudden freebie.
	   ``Why not?'' Seinfeld said. ``You were in the right place at the
right time _ that's what made my career.''
	   The audience learned about the giveaway just before the comedian
took the stage Friday night at the Des Moines Civic Center, where
Seinfeld gave away all of the nearly 11,000 tickets to his four
weekend shows.
	   ``He wants to give back to the community that's supported him
through all this time,'' tour manager Kevin Dochtermann told the
crowd. Audience members who paid more than dlrs 60 each for tickets
were given refunds. About 2,000 remaining tickets were given away
Saturday morning.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Debbie Reynolds is willing to work with buyers
to maintain the Hollywood entertainment theme of her bankrupt
hotel-casino that goes up for auction Wednesday.
	   Ultimately, the property's fate will lie in the hands its new
owner, meaning the Las Vegas resort could close, change theme
entirely or continue on as the Debbie Reynolds Hotel and Casino.
	   Her son, Todd Fisher, doubts it will close because most
prospective buyers want to know whether Reynolds, her name and her
Hollywood Motion Picture and Television Museum are available.
	   ``Debbie is saying, `Look, when you own the property, we'll
talk,''' Fisher, chief executive of the resort's operating company,
told the Las Vegas Sun.
	   The hotel-casino that opened in 1993 has suffered financially
despite millions of dollars spent on renovations. The 180-room
hotel includes a 500-seat showroom where Reynolds and other
celebrities performed, along with a museum of Hollywood memorabilia
the veteran actress-singer collected over the years.
	   In July 1997, the resort declared bankruptcy. Reynolds declared
personal bankruptcy and resigned as chairwoman and director of the
company.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Chiapas state is arranging compensation
payments for 18 women whose husbands died in a December massacre at
the village of Acteal, a government official said Saturday.
	   The women will receive from dlrs 562 to dlrs 1,685 each to
compensate for the loss of their family's primary wage-earner,
state Deputy Secretary Roberto Munoz Lievano told the government
news agency Notimex.
	   ``I know that the money will not compensate for their pain, but
it would not be worthwhile to leave them to drift,'' Munoz said.
	   Forty-five people, mostly women and children, were slaughtered
Dec. 22 in the village sympathetic to leftist Zapatista rebels.
	   More than 150 people, including state officials and police
officers, have been charged or are under investigation in
connection with the killings.
	   The massacre was one of the bloodiest in Chiapas, where rebels
took up arms in January 1994 to demand greater democracy and Indian
rights. Peace talks with the government have been stalled since
1996.
	   ____
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) - Police have identified the third
of eight victims of a suspected serial killer who has terrorized
Sao Paulo women for the past eight months, Brazilian media reported
Saturday.
	   Elisangela Francisco da Silva, 21, who was found a week ago, was
identified by her finger prints, O Globo newspaper reported.
	   Francisco de Assis Pereira, 31, is believed to be behind the
deaths of da Silva and seven other women, whose bodies were found
over several months in a wooded park. Nine other women, who were
assaulted in the park but escaped alive, identified Pereira from
composite drawings and photographs.
	   Pereira, a motorcycle courier, was last seen two weeks ago at
his uncle's house, Sao Paulo detectives say. Da Silva, a student,
disappeared May 9.
	   ___
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Three nuclear power plants will
be privatized by the end of the year, a daily newspaper in Buenos
Aires reported Saturday.
	   According to La Nacion, the United States' Bechtel, Canada's
Atomic Energy, Electricite de France, Japan's Marubeni and Spain's
Iberdrola are interested in the deal.
	   The successful bidder would receive 89 percent of the holding
company Genuar SA. Company employees would receive 10 percent, and
the government would keep 1 percent.
	   Congress approved the bill authorizing the sale of the plants in
April 1997.
	   ____
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Thousands of Santiago residents rallied
Saturday to demand stronger government measures against pollution.
	   As the demonstrators peacefully listened to rock and folk
groups, the government issued a smog emergency for Sunday that will
force 20 percent of the city's 650,000 vehicles off the streets.
	   Santiago has a serious air pollution problem that is often
compared to Los Angeles or Mexico City. The problem has worsened in
recent months because of a lack of rain.
	   ____
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Water service is being shut off for eight
hours a night in Monterrey, Mexico's third-largest city, due to a
severe drought that has left dam levels at record lows in the
northern part of the country, a report said Saturday.
	   The rationing program, under which service is suspended between
10 p.m. and 4 a.m., began on Thursday, water director Jesus
Hinojosa Tijerina told the daily El Universal.
	   Three million people are affected, the report said.
	   With local dams at 40 percent capacity, Hinojosa Tijerina said
water authorities were trying to cut overall use by 20 percent in
order to maintain reserves.
	   ____
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ New activity by the Colima Volcano in western
Mexico has raised concern about a possible eruption, a Mexico City
newspaper reported Saturday.
	   A monitoring network has detected ``a moderate increase in the
volcano's internal activity which signals the possibility, which
has always existed, that it could erupt,'' the government of Colima
state said in a report by the daily Reforma.
	   The 13,000-foot (4,000-meter) volcano lies in a mountainous area
440 miles (710 kilometers) west of Mexico City near the Pacific
coast. It is the highest North American volcano that has had major
seismic activity in the past 30 years.
	   The Colima government said the recent activity posed no risk to
nearby communities. Still it warned people to stay at least five
kilometers (three miles) away from the volcano's dome.
	   The volcanic activity offers an ``opportunity to advise that the
colossus is alive,'' state civil protection director Melcho Urzua
told the government news agency Notimex.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ For years, former Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez has been Spain's most popular politician, an enthusiastic
crowd-pleaser who oversaw the country's return to democracy in the
1980s.
	   Although his Socialist governments became mired in scandal,
Gonzalez managed to elude charges of wrongdoing. But his image
blurred last week when the Supreme Court convicted 12 Socialist
politicians, including a former Cabinet minister, of waging a dirty
war against Basque separatists.
	   For some, the decision confirms Socialist corruption during
Gonzalez's 1982-96 administrations. For others, it is just another
attempt to discredit Gonzalez and his party.
	   Gonzalez, 56, has insisted for years that his administrations
never broke laws in their campaign to stamp out ETA armed
commandos. If the courts ever established otherwise, he has said he
would take the heat.
	   Yet after Wednesday's convictions, Gonzalez's reaction was to
affirm his support for Jose Luis Barrionuevo, his former minister
in charge of security and police, and Barrionuevo's deputy, Rafael
Vera, to the end.
	   Prison sentences of two to 10 years concluded one of the most
sensational trials in recent Spanish history. Barrionuevo, interior
minister from 1982-88, and the 11 other ministry and police
officials were convicted of kidnapping a French businessman in 1983
who they thought, incorrectly, was an ETA activist. He was released
unharmed 10 days later.
	   Barrionuevo's conviction was the first against a Cabinet
minister since Spain returned to democracy in 1978 after nearly
four decades of dictatorship under Gen. Francisco Franco.
	   The abduction that led to 10-year sentences for Barrionuevo and
Vera was the first action undertaken by the clandestine GAL death
squad, which is blamed for killing 27 people from 1983-87. Many of
those killed were falsely accused of ETA ties.
	   ETA, the Basque-language initials for Basque Homeland and
Liberty, is one of Europe's few remaining armed political groups.
It was extremely active when the Socialists took office, killing
dozens of police officers every year. During its 30-year
independence campaign, ETA has killed nearly 800 people.
	   Gonzalez testified that his governments had nothing to do with
the GAL death squad. He has called the verdict unjust and says the
conservative government of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar
pressured the court.
	   Many of Gonzalez's supporters don't seem too concerned about
whether the former prime minister was involved with the death
squad, arguing that harsh measures were needed to confront the ETA.
	   However, Spain's third-ranking parliamentary group, United Left,
and the influential Basque Nationalist Party say Gonzalez must
retire from politics in the wake of the convictions.
	   Gonzalez, a parliamentary deputy, is being considered for the
presidency of the European Commission in 2000. He also serves as a
mediator in the conflict in the Serbian province of Kosovo.
	   But most Spaniards appear more interested in their vacations _
the nation essentially shuts down in August _ than the verdict.
	   Popular outcry was limited Wednesday to a lone demonstrator
outside the courthouse carrying a sign that read, in part: ``The
judges are sheep and ETA is celebrating with champagne.''

Astros 2, Pirates 1
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PITTSBURGH (AP) _ Jose Lima, in danger of losing his starting
job to Randy Johnson, pitched a five-hitter and struck out 10 as
the Houston Astros beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 2-1 Saturday.
	   The Astros, who led the NL Central even before landing Johnson
in a deadline-beating trade Friday night, have won five of six. The
Pirates have lost five of six.
	   Manager Larry Dierker, admittedly buoyed by a megadeal that
brought the Astros one of baseball's premier starters, said before
the game that only Sean Bergman and Mike Hampton were sure of
staying in the rotation.
	   Lima (10-6) then went out and pitched like he plans on keeping
his job, limiting the Pirates to three hits in the final seven
innings. He walked one in his second consecutive complete game.
	   Mike Williams (2-1) took the loss.
	   Pirates first baseman Kevin Young had to be restrained by four
players and coaches after charging umpire Brian Gibbons. Young
apparently grazed Gibbons on the mouth with his hand after a called
third strike.
 &UR; Cubs 3, Rockies 2
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ The Chicago Cubs, helped by a lucky bounce over
the shoulder of right fielder Sammy Sosa with two outs in the ninth
inning, held off the Colorado Rockies.
	   Larry Walker singled with two outs in the Rockies ninth and
Dante Bichette followed with an apparent triple. But Bichette's
soft liner skipped over the falling Sosa, and the ball rolled
underneath the padding of the wall in the bullpen area.
	   Walker had already crossed the plate when umpires ruled the play
as a ground-rule double, sending him back to third. Rod Beck
escaped for his 32nd save by getting Vinny Castilla on a
game-ending lineout to Sosa.
	   Steve Trachsel (11-5) won his fifth straight and John Thomson
(5-8) was the loser.
 &UR; Braves 3, Cardinals 1
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Keith Lockhart's two-run single capped a
three-run eighth inning off St. Louis relievers as the Atlanta
Braves beat the Cardinals.
	   Lockhart's hit up the middle off Curtis King drove in Javy Lopez
and Michael Tucker with the tiebreaking runs. The Braves had tied
the game on consecutive singles off Rich Croushore (0-3) by Andres
Galarraga, Ryan Klesko and Lopez.
	   Rudy Seanez (4-0) got the win and Kerry Ligtenberg pitched the
ninth for his 15th save.
	   Mark McGwire went 0-for-4, striking out twice, to remain stuck
on 45 homers.

	   MEMPHIS, Tennessee (AP) _ Nick Price righted a shaky round with
two birdies on the back nine and Bob Estes came out of the pack
with a 4-under-par 67 on Saturday to share the lead in the FedEx
St. Jude Classic.
	   Price, who has topped the leaderboard all three days, shot a 70
to match Estes at 11-under 202 on the TPC at Southwind course. Jeff
Sluman (66), Tim Conley (67) and Paul Azinger (69) were a stroke
back.
	   Kevin Wentworth was alone in sixth place at 9-under. Joe Durant
and Glen Day are at 8-under, and Scott Verplank is at 7-under after
shooting a 67 Saturday that required just 19 putts.
	   John Daly, renowned for his tantrums, had another one Saturday.
Daly was 3-under on the front nine before double-bogeying three
holes on the back side. He was disqualified after failing to sign
his scorecard.
	   Price, looking for his first PGA Tour victory since the MCI
Classic in April 1997. battled an erratic driver on the front nine
and made the turn at 1-over par for the day.
	   He got a break on No. 10 when his drive hit a tree and
ricocheted into the fairway, which, he said, ``sort of turned my
day around.''
	   Price went on to birdie the par-4 12th and the par-5 16th, which
he had eagled the previous two rounds.
	   ``If we have the same sort of conditions tomorrow there are
probably 14 or 15 guys who could win it,'' Price said of the dry
and breezy conditions. ``There's not much wind, but it's enough to
put a little doubt in your mind.''
	   Estes has five top-10 finishes this year, but hasn't won since
1994. He birdied three of the last four holes, including the tough
par-4 17th, to post his second straight 67.
	   ``It's been too long since I was in the last group on Sunday,''
Estes said. ``I'd rather be there. That means you can make more
mistakes than everybody else and still have a chance to win.''
	   Azinger, looking for his first tour victory since a bout with
cancer five years ago, is comfortable where he is.
	   ``My goal has been to get into contention and I am,'' he said.
``I don't think anything's really missing from my game, I just need
to pull it off.''
	   Conley began the day 6-under and birdied four straight holes on
the front side to make the turn at 10-under, then played the back
side in par.
	   Sluman and Robert Damron had the low rounds of the day with 66s.
Damron teed off first and played by himself, completing his round
in 2 hours, 34 minutes to move from a tie for 64th into 17th place.
	   Sluman birdied four straight holes on the front side and picked
up another stroke on the back with a 12-foot (3 1/2-meter) birdie
putt on No. 18.
	   ``If you had told me starting the day I'd shoot 5-under and be
this close to the lead, I'd have been very surprised,'' Sluman
said. ``All three of the par 5s are reachable for most of the
players.''
	   Day started play at 9-under and quickly moved to 11-under and
into a share of the lead with birdies at Nos. 4 and 5, but a double
bogey at No. 15 pushed him to 8-under for the tournament.
	   Wentworth, a left-hander who spent the last two years playing
primarily in Asia, jump-started his round with an ace on the
183-yard fourth hole. His a 6-iron shot landed 8 inches (20
centimeters) away and hopped into the cup.
 &UR; Divots: Wentworth's hole-in-one was the second of the tournament.
Ted Tryba had one on Friday, and the 22nd on the tour this season.
... Price, the 1993 St. Jude champion, is trying to become the
first repeat winner of the tournament since Lee Trevino won his
third title in 1980. ... Durant is the only player among the top 48
who has won a tournament this year, the Western Open.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Chiapas state is arranging compensation
payments for 18 women whose husbands died in a December massacre at
the village of Acteal, a government official said Saturday.
	   The women will receive from dlrs 562 to dlrs 1,685 each to
compensate for the loss of their family's primary wage-earner,
state Deputy Secretary Roberto Munoz Lievano told the government
news agency Notimex.
	   ``I know that the money will not compensate for their pain, but
it would not be worthwhile to leave them to drift,'' Munoz said.
	   Forty-five people, mostly women and children, were slaughtered
Dec. 22 in the village sympathetic to leftist Zapatista rebels.
	   More than 150 people, including state officials and police
officers, have been charged or are under investigation in
connection with the killings.
	   The massacre was one of the bloodiest in Chiapas, where rebels
took up arms in January 1994 to demand greater democracy and Indian
rights. Peace talks with the government have been stalled since
1996.
	   ____
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) - Police have identified the third
of eight victims of a suspected serial killer who has terrorized
Sao Paulo women for the past eight months, Brazilian media reported
Saturday.
	   Elisangela Francisco da Silva, 21, who was found a week ago, was
identified by her finger prints, O Globo newspaper reported.
	   Francisco de Assis Pereira, 31, is believed to be behind the
deaths of da Silva and seven other women, whose bodies were found
over several months in a wooded park. Nine other women, who were
assaulted in the park but escaped alive, identified Pereira from
composite drawings and photographs.
	   Pereira, a motorcycle courier, was last seen two weeks ago at
his uncle's house, Sao Paulo detectives say. Da Silva, a student,
disappeared May 9.
	   ___
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Three nuclear power plants will
be privatized by the end of the year, a daily newspaper in Buenos
Aires reported Saturday.
	   According to La Nacion, the United States' Bechtel, Canada's
Atomic Energy, Electricite de France, Japan's Marubeni and Spain's
Iberdrola are interested in the deal.
	   The successful bidder would receive 89 percent of the holding
company Genuar SA. Company employees would receive 10 percent, and
the government would keep 1 percent.
	   Congress approved the bill authorizing the sale of the plants in
April 1997.
	   ____
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Thousands of Santiago residents rallied
Saturday to demand stronger government measures against pollution.
	   As the demonstrators peacefully listened to rock and folk
groups, the government issued a smog emergency for Sunday that will
force 20 percent of the city's 650,000 vehicles off the streets.
	   Santiago has a serious air pollution problem that is often
compared to Los Angeles or Mexico City. The problem has worsened in
recent months because of a lack of rain.
	   ____
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Water service is being shut off for six hours
a night in Monterrey, Mexico's third-largest city, due to a severe
drought that has left dam levels at record lows in the northern
part of the country, a report said Saturday.
	   The rationing program, under which service is suspended between
10 p.m. and 4 a.m., began on Thursday, water director Jesus
Hinojosa Tijerina told the daily El Universal.
	   Three million people are affected, the report said.
	   With local dams at 40 percent capacity, Hinojosa Tijerina said
water authorities were trying to cut overall use by 20 percent in
order to maintain reserves.
	   ____
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ New activity by the Colima Volcano in western
Mexico has raised concern about a possible eruption, a Mexico City
newspaper reported Saturday.
	   A monitoring network has detected ``a moderate increase in the
volcano's internal activity which signals the possibility, which
has always existed, that it could erupt,'' the government of Colima
state said in a report by the daily Reforma.
	   The 13,000-foot (4,000-meter) volcano lies in a mountainous area
440 miles (710 kilometers) west of Mexico City near the Pacific
coast. It is the highest North American volcano that has had major
seismic activity in the past 30 years.
	   The Colima government said the recent activity posed no risk to
nearby communities. Still it warned people to stay at least five
kilometers (three miles) away from the volcano's dome.
	   The volcanic activity offers an ``opportunity to advise that the
colossus is alive,'' state civil protection director Melcho Urzua
told the government news agency Notimex.

Repairmen take a shine to keeping the Strip aglow

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Gary Hendricks scans the rainbow of neon and
incandescent lights on the Las Vegas Strip. Signs blur as his truck
whips past casinos, but he spots the flaw. There's a bulb out in
the letter ``e.''
	   It's a tiny glitch in this city of lights, but it will gnaw at
Hendricks until it's fixed. ``People look at a sign and say 'That
looks great.' We say, 'Not really. That's out, that's out, that's
out.'''
	   In a city defined by neon arcs and blinking bulbs, keeping it
bright is quite a chore.
	   As service manager for Young Electric Sign Co., the largest sign
company servicing the city's casinos, Hendricks spends his nights
and pre-dawn hours patrolling the glitzy Strip and downtown's
Glitter Gulch looking for burned-out bulbs.
	   For the untrained eye, they're hard to spot. But to Hendricks
and 50 other employees in YESCO's service department, they are as
common as a cheap buffet in this town.
	   ``All the neon looks good,'' Hendricks says, driving past a
prominent hotel-casino. He leans forward, squints and scribbles on
a notepad. ``There is a bulb out at Palace Station.''
	   YESCO, which operates throughout the West, first began designing
signs and lighting casinos in 1932, a year after gambling was
legalized in Las Vegas. Since then, the company has provided
signage for most hotel-casinos and many restaurants and businesses.
	   The company is often pressed for new designs; their giant
guitars adorn the Hard Rock Hotel and nearby Hard Rock Cafe. But
some casinos shun neon altogether.
	   When Mirage Resorts Inc. opened the Mirage in 1989, it wanted
something different, says spokeswoman Jenn Michaels. The company
decided that the only neon on Mirage properties, including Treasure
Island and the Golden Nugget, would be the gold lettering in the
signs. Mirage chairman Steve Wynn often claims that Las Vegas has
moved ``beyond neon.''
	   YESCO keeps the 2 million incandescent bulbs bright in the
Fremont Street Experience, a dlrs 70 million light-and-sound
extravaganza. The lights dance each night on a canopy nine stories
high and four blocks long.
	   Brian Hagedorn, the YESCO employee who monitors the light show,
searches for computer malfunctions each night. If he spies a
not-quite-right light or a not-so-animated character, he climbs
atop the canopy to fix the problem.
	   Hendricks keeps an eye on Hagedorn's effort. ``We're almost
possessed,'' says this 25-year veteran on patrol, a rappeller of
buildings. ``We're not happy until a sign's perfect.''
	   Most folks won't even see burnouts because employees are
prowling 21 hours a day and fixing them fast. Hendricks is adamant.
``This is advertising,'' he says. ``How would you feel if you
opened up your Sunday paper and half the ad was missing?''
	   He tells stories odd enough to fill that space.
	   One casino executive, whom he declines to name, is
superstitious, just like many players. If a high-roller is doing
well, and a bulb or panel of neon burns out, he calls for immediate
repairs. ``They try and tie luck to signs and lighting,'' Hendricks
says.
	   Until last year, hundreds of castoffs rested in a sign graveyard
next to YESCO and miles (kilometers) from the Strip. Many are
rusted from years of exposure; others are cannibalized for parts.
	   The most prized ones, including a genie lamp from the old
Aladdin resort and a horse and rider from the Hacienda, have been
placed in neon museum downtown, just a few feet (meters) from the
Fremont Street Experience.
	   The outdoor museum opened last year. Funded by the city, it's
free and always open. For the next seven years, the city will keep
the exhibits fresh with YESCO castoffs.
	   Meanwhile, it's Hendricks' job to avoid throwaways. On this
night, after a quick cruise of the Strip and a stop downtown,
Hendricks logs in the next day's repairs.
	   He looks forward to climbing into bed and, at least until
tomorrow, turning out the lights.

	   LIKOVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian forces attacked and burned
villages Saturday in troubled Kosovo province, despite an official
pledge that their offensive was over. The fighting added to a flood
of displaced and destitute people fleeing their homes.
	   On Thursday, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic told a
European Union delegation that an eight-day Serb offensive against
the Kosovo Liberation Army had ended. But he refused to pull police
and the federal army from the province, a key demand by ethnic
Albanians before negotiations can start on a peaceful settlement of
the conflict that has killed hundreds of people, including many
children.
	   In Likovac, a stronghold of the Kosovo Liberation Army in the
northwestern Drenica area, a high-ranking KLA commander said Serb
police had launched a new offensive Saturday against a cluster of
13 villages.
	   He told reporters that houses were being targeted by artillery
in the area near Klina, 30 miles (50 kilometers) west of Pristina.
	   It was unclear how many people were killed and wounded. The KLA
is fighting for independence for Kosovo, a province in the Serb
republic that makes up most of Yugoslavia. Milosevic has offered
the province autonomy.
	   Reporters saw fires burning in at least three villages and a
stream of new refugees fleeing their homes in dozens of cars and
other vehicles.
	   ``They burned everything,'' said Hamdi Doci, a man fleeing with
his family in a car.
	   He said Serb forces started shooting so that people would leave
their homes. Once they had fled, the Serbs looted the houses,
doused them with gasoline and set them ablaze, he said.
	   Skirmishes continued Saturday elsewhere in Kosovo, where 90
percent of the 2 million inhabitants are Albanian. One KLA fighter
was killed west of Pristina near the open-pit coal mine Belacevac,
the scene of heavy fighting earlier this month, Albanian sources
said.
	   A Serb policeman was killed early Saturday in the area of
Malisevo, a key rebel stronghold that was retaken by government
forces earlier in the week.
	   Meanwhile, international charitable organization began ferrying
food and other supplies to thousands of ethnic Albanians who have
become refugees in their own homeland. A 14-truck aid convoy
reached the southern town of Prizren.
	   A small convoy carrying aid from the U.N. refugee agency, the
World Food Program and other charities also delivered wheat flour,
cooking oil, mineral water and other essentials to up to 1,000
refugees camped in the hills northwest of Malisevo.
	   One of the refugees, Tafil Morina, said conditions at the camp
were dismal. ``Europe must help us because the situation is
critical,'' he said.

Morgan cruises to three-stroke lead in Utah Showdown
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GREG BEACHAM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) _ Gil Morgan is generally considered the
second-best player on the Senior PGA Tour, though even Hale Irwin
would flinch at the numbers Morgan is putting up in Utah.
	   Morgan, in search of his fifth victory of the season, continued
his assault on the Park Meadows course with a 5-under-par 67 in the
second round of the Utah Showdown on Saturday. His two-round score
of 133 was just one stroke off the 36-hole record in the event.
	   Morgan didn't bogey a hole in the first two rounds. Only eight
bogey-free tournaments have been recorded in senior tour history,
the last by Park Meadows no-show and U.S. Senior Open champion
Irwin.
	   Not bad for a man who didn't enter the tournament until earlier
this week and had never played Park Meadows before Tuesday.
	   ``This is a golf course you can shoot low numbers on,'' Morgan
said. ``I haven't taken a whole lot of chances, but this course is
generous.''
	   He holds a three-stroke lead over John Mahaffey entering
Sunday's final round. Morgan has never blown a lead entering the
final day of competition in his senior career.
	   The two will be joined in the final grouping by two-time
Showdown champion Dave Stockton, who sits four strokes back in a
tie with Bob Duval.
	   The Jack Nicklaus-designed course was hit by intermittent rains
earlier in the week, but by Saturday the fairways were dry, and
balmy weather encouraged blistering scores. All told, 42 players
were under par in Saturday's round.
	   Mahaffey, winner of the 1978 PGA Championship, had an eagle and
a birdie in the final four holes to finish with a 6-under 66, the
best score of the day.
	   ``I'm going to have to shoot something like this or better
tomorrow to beat Gil Morgan,'' said Mahaffey, who only became
eligible for the senior tour in May. ``There's some guys like Gil
on this tour who are playing better now than they did on the
regular tour.''
	   Duval, the father of PGA Tour star David Duval, started the day
tied with Morgan for the lead. Duval was right with Morgan until a
double bogey on 16 knocked him back to 7-under, four strokes back
in a tie with Stockton.
	   ``Four strokes are a lot to give the Doc (Morgan, a
non-practicing optometrist) and then try to catch him,'' Bob Duval
said. ``He's just playing so good that he doesn't make any
mistakes.''
	   Even when Morgan should have been in trouble, he managed to come
out smiling. He put his approach shot in a greenside bunker on the
fourth hole, but he then chipped in from 60 feet (18 meters).
	   ``I couldn't figure that one out,'' Duval said. ``He's making
some ridiculous shots.''
	   Stockton, who has finished lower than second just once in the
last five years at this tournament, made three birdies on the back
nine to stay in contention. It was Stockton who convinced Morgan to
enter the Showdown after last week's U.S. Open.
	   ``I'm glad Gil came along, even though he's shooting a lot
better than he should,'' Stockton joked.
	   As he was throughout his Hall of Fame baseball career, Johnny
Bench was the model of consistency on the second day of his senior
tour debut. Playing with his teacher, Phil Rodgers, Bench shot his
second straight 6-over 78.
	   ``I never got comfortable today,'' Bench said. ``I'm still
having fun, but I didn't have as much today. I wanted to play much
better. ... I'm probably working on my swing too much during the
round.''
	   Charles Coody shot a second-round 68 to win the dlrs 16,000
MasterCard championship, given to the senior player over 60 with
the best two-day score. Coody finished the first two rounds at
3-under.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Marian Chesney had returned from vacation in
remote northern Scotland, where the wind screamed across the
landscape, and she mentioned the trip to a book editor during a
walk in Manhattan. It would be a good setting, she remarked, for a
murder mystery.
	   ``Who would your detective be?'' the editor asked.
	   ``The village policeman,'' popped out of the writer's mouth.
	   ``What's his name?''
	   ``Hamish Macbeth.''
	   Thus, Hamish Macbeth, laid-back constable of tiny, fictional
Lochdubh, Scotland, was born in an instant on Fifth Avenue in New
York in 1983.
	   A Scottish name for the author, too, would be nice, suggested
her editor. So, M.C. Beaton was created, the initials Marian
Chesney's own and the surname drawn from a line in a Scottish
ballad, ``The queen she had four Marys, Mary Seton, Mary Beaton,
Mary Carmichael and me.''
	   Scottish-born Beaton based Macbeth's personality on a part-time
worker at her first job, in a Glasgow book store. ``He was a
divinity student called Donald McKenzie, 6 feet (1.8-meter) tall
and very gangly, his bony wrists sticking out of his sleeves. He
had absolutely no airs or pretensions. This is the charm of the
Highlands people. They think they're equal to everyone. It's not an
arrogance. They treat everyone the same. It stuck in my mind as an
amiable characteristic.''
	   Now, Beaton produces one Macbeth mystery a year; her 14th,
released in June, is ``Death of a Scriptwriter.''
	   A second series of her detective novels follows the exploits of
Agatha Raisin, whom the 55-year-old Beaton describes as ``a pushy
middle-aged woman. Guess who that's based on.''
	   Raisin acts out some of her creator's impulses. Recently, when
Beaton parked just over the line on a day ``bucketing with rain,''
she says, a woman berated her long and loud. Beaton, who wasn't
blocking traffic or other cars' parking, politely said nothing but
thought plenty. In a book, Raisin would have said it all, ending
with, ``Sod off.''
	   In addition to her annual Macbeth book for Mysterious Press,
Beaton produces two Agatha Raisins for St. Martin's Press. The
latest is ``Agatha Raisin and the Wellspring of Death,'' the
seventh in that series.
	   Both new books were reviewed favorably by The New York Times.
Mysterious Press is about to bring all the Hamish Macbeth mysteries
back into print.
	   Three books a year isn't difficult, Beaton says, because she was
trained as a journalist. ``You get used to crystalizing your ideas
very quickly and you do your own editing. In the old days, you had
to phone in stories and you had to be lucid.''
	   Beaton worked on newspapers and wrote Regency romances before
she starting writing mysteries. She worked for the London Daily
Express, and married a fellow journalist, Harry Gibbons, Middle
East correspondent for the Daily Mail. (Gibbons has written about
his brief stint as a British spy before his cover was blown by
George Blake, ``master spy, master traitor,'' as Beaton calls him.)
	   In the 1970s they brought their journalistic skills to America,
to a small paper on New York's Long Island.
	   A difficult time followed, as they tried and failed to find
newspaper jobs in Washington, D.C. They ended up taking jobs at
Steve's Diner. Gibbons worked an all-night, 12-hour shift. At 6
a.m., Beaton arrived, handed him their infant son and worked in the
diner for eight hours.
	   ``It wasn't pleasant at the time,'' Beaton says, ``but it's all
right. You're surviving. It takes the fear and snobbery away that
you're a journalist and you can't do anything else.''
	   After a short time on Rupert Murdoch's Star in Manhattan, they
left for an 18-acre (7-hectare) croft in Scotland, where Gibbons
raised sheep and Beaton got ideas for Hamish Macbeth stories. Then
it was back to London to place their son, Charlie, who had a
Brooklyn accent, in high school at Westminster.
	   Beaton tells the story of a charity bake sale at that school.
	   ``I wasn't going to let the side down and say I can't bake
anything,'' she recalls. ``I bought a quiche and put it in my own
wrappings and they sold it. It was a great success.''
	   It gave her the idea for the first Agatha Raisin adventure,
``Agatha Raisin and the Quiche of Death.''
	   ``In the book, Agatha buys a quiche, puts her own wrappings on
it and a judge drops dead of poisoning. The police come around,
asking `How did you cook this?' and she makes an awful fool of
herself. To save face, she has to prove who murdered the judge.''
	   The latest Agatha Raisin book also was inspired by real events.
``A bottled water company wanted to come every morning to get
spring water. The villagers didn't want lorries coming through the
village every morning. I thought, what would happen if you had a
parish council and half wanted that and half didn't and the
chairman was found dead.''
	   Beaton and her husband moved from London to an 1807 house in a
Cotswold village when Charlie's high school house master said their
son would surely go to Oxford, so why not move nearby? ``Our son
went to Cambridge, on the other side of the country,'' Beaton says.
``It's just as well _ instead of having doting parents around his
neck.''
	   An upcoming Agatha Raisin idea came in a beauty parlor visit.
``My hairdresser was very upset. A rival had poached all her staff
away. I began to get into the jealousies and feuds in hairdressing.
Women talk to their hairdresser as if they're talking to a
psychiatrist.
	   ``I thought: What a wonderful job for a blackmailer. I haven't
figured out how to bump somebody off with a beauty treatment. I'm
sure you could electrocute somebody. They won't tell me how.
	   ``For `Death of a Hussy,' for Hamish, my local garage mechanics
worked out how to get a car to burst into flames when you turned
the key in the ignition,'' she said. ``They were very helpful.''

Flea-market suitcase yields stars' letters, a girl's dreams

 &UR; By MELISSA WILLIAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DALLAS (AP) _ It was a time when famous singers and songwriters
would not only read a star-struck girl's letters, but they would
reply on handsome studio letterhead and sign them with a flourish.
	   And it was a time when a music lover might hope to write lyrics
as stirring as those written by Johnny Mercer and crooned by Bing
Crosby.
	   It was pre-World War II New York, and Marie Manovill had the
highest of hopes.
	   She was just 14 when she struck up pen-pal friendships with
Mercer, Crosby and other glamorous stars. Although she never wrote
a hit, she lived out a fantasy through correspondence.
	   For decades Marie continued writing to her idols. And they kept
writing back, their letters increasingly personal and cordially
affectionate.
	   Marie stashed the letters in a brown suitcase and never told
anyone. So when she died in 1979, the letters seemed lost. Until
recently, when they unceremoniously tumbled onto a New York City
sidewalk.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   Gloria Burleson, of Dallas, took her sister to New York last May
to see Broadway shows and shop at flea markets she'd noticed when
visiting the city months earlier with her husband.
	   The two women were browsing through used-clothing stalls in
Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood when Gloria decided to buy a bag
for her purchases. For dlrs 5 she picked up a secondhand suitcase
decorated with travel stickers.
	   But the brown case was hard to budge. The flea-market vendor
looked inside, saw papers that looked like rubbish and told Gloria
and her sister, Gail Nelson of Arlington, Texas, that they were
stuck with it all.
	   Halfway to a trash can, the suitcase burst. As Gloria scrambled
after pieces, she realized what she had.
	   ``I said, `Gail, look! Bing Crosby! Then I opened up another one
and I go, `Johnny Mercer! Oh my gosh, it's Johnny Mercer!'''
	   They rushed back to their hotel in a cab and sat in the lobby
absorbed in their find: Charles Boyer. Damon Runyon. Oscar
Hammerstein II. Jeanette MacDonald. Walter Huston. All had written
to Marie Manovill, who had squirreled away more than 100 of their
missives with the care of love letters. Which, in a sense, they
are.
	    &UR; ___
	   Marie Meredith Manovill, born in New York City in 1921 to a
mother whose favorite composer was John Philip Sousa, decided early
to make music her life's work.
	   The privileged daughter of a Gimbel Bros. retailing executive,
Marie apparently wrote first to Crosby. His earliest reply is four
typed paragraphs, dated July 1936 and signed.
	   ``Thanks for your letter and interest. I appreciate knowing how
my efforts are received and welcome any suggestions. `Rhythm on the
Range' which is completed, will be released this fall, and `Pennies
From Heaven' is my next ...''
	   There were no copies of Marie's letters. The responses, however,
seem to be replies to a conversation she started.
	   In December 1936, Crosby encouraged her writing efforts. ``I am
not a poet, and am not an expert on poetry, but your poems look
very possible,'' he wrote before signing ``Bing.''
	   In 1939, after relatively impersonal notes, Crosby answered, but
not optimistically: ``While you certainly have ability as a writer,
you have selected the most difficult field.''
	   In time, Marie got a job at Irving Berlin's music publishing
company and later worked for other music publishers. Then she moved
to Cleveland to work on a TV show and returned to New York to write
advertising jingles.
	   She eventually made it onto the Crosby family's Christmas card
list, with greetings into the early 1960s.
	   All the while, she worked on her own songs: ``John Is Love,''
``Remembering Summer,'' ``Been Out of Love Too Long.''
	   None went far, except to one of the greatest songwriters in the
history of American pop music.

	   ``It is really pretty tough getting publishers to listen to
them; especially if you are a girl,'' Johnny Mercer wrote in March
1942. ``My advice is still the same, however, and that is to keep
trying.''
	   Three months later, he offered a tempered compliment: ``I think
the lyric you sent is quite nice but not distinguished, mainly
because you just have a desire to write and really not an idea to
say much with.''
	   In October 1945, Mercer suggested changes to ``I Never Had a
Love Before.''
	   ``I have marked in pencil the lines that I am not particularly
crazy about,'' he wrote. ``The only other criticism is that I feel
you should personalize the song right away instead of waiting until
the last line. Outside of this I think it is quite good.''
	   Sheet music for two songs, not those he critiqued, was tucked
among the letters. Judging by his responses, her work improved.
	   ``I think the lyric you sent in your last letter ... is one of
the very best you have ever done,'' Mercer wrote in July 1947. ``I
surely think it should be written up and published. I have no
suggestions.''
	   Over the years, Mercer's letters shed their formality. One of
the loveliest arrived in 1960.
	   ``Marie, sweetie: ... Nothin' new with me except talk,'' he
wrote. ``Talk about this show and maybe that show, etc. but I've
got no definite project as yet.
	   ``A song I wrote with Hank Mancini looks like a hit and a
possible Oscar winner come sweepstake time. It's called ``Moon
River,'' in case you should hear it or see the picture. See it if
you can _ it's funny _ called ``Breakfast at Tiffany's.''
	   Mercer was right, of course. ``Moon River'' won him a 1961
Academy Award, one of his four, with Henry Mancini.
	   In another 1960 letter, Mercer kindly responded to Marie's news
of breast cancer, a disease that would kill her at age 57.
	   ``What a letter to get just as the new year starts!'' he wrote.
``To me, cancer is like saying you can't see _ it's just one of
those things I don't believe ... How brave you sound, and how like
you!''
	    &UR; ___
	   All the way back to Dallas, Gloria Burleson wondered about the
original owner of the brown suitcase and the story behind the
letters.
	   As luck would have it, Marie's sister, Carolyn, was still living
in New York City, the only Manovill in the Manhattan telephone
directory.
	   The pair talked for hours about Marie's life and her dreams of
song-writing. Carolyn, now 78, described her sister as shy but with
enough pluck to ask Crosby for help when she wanted the job with
Irving Berlin.
	   She recalled that Marie wrote to Larry Crosby, his brother's
manager, and asked permission to say she had worked for the singer.
A telegram reply said: ``Bing says all right. Good luck.''
	   Carolyn guessed that the suitcase got separated from Marie's
estate either right after her death, when her belongings were
stored during a court fight over ownership, or recently, when
Carolyn got behind in rent and the storage company sold off the
contents.
	   Might these items have more than sentimental value? Gloria has
asked two New York City auction houses, Christie's and Sotheby's,
to appraise the papers. The autographs, she said, may be worth
hundreds of dollars each, maybe more to a collector who might want
to keep the items together.
	   But Gloria isn't really eager to sell. ``I've grown more and
more in love with it,'' she said. ``The story behind it is why I
might not be able to let go.''

A beautiful `Oklahoma!' brightens London's theater scene

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ ``Oklahoma!'' is the famous Rodgers and
Hammerstein musical whose opening song celebrates a ``beautiful
mornin''' turning into a ``beautiful day.''
	   Now, a dreary London summer is being made beautiful by an
English revival of the 1943 American classic at the Royal National
Theater.
	   The state-funded National in 1992 reclaimed a subsequent Rodgers
and Hammerstein treasure, ``Carousel,'' and sent it winging around
the world in a staging that found unexpected depths of emotion in a
show about clambakes, domestic violence and death.
	   But can ``Oklahoma!'' match the clout of ``Carousel,'' inasmuch
as its synopsis makes it look to be about nothing more or less
earth-shattering than who _ Curly or Jud _ will take Laurey to the
box social?
	   The answer is yes, and audiences have until Oct. 3 to find out
for themselves. Tickets are selling fast, with the National
breaking the box-office records previously set by Alan Bennett's
play, ``The Madness of George III,'' and the revival of another
Broadway classic, ``Guys and Dolls.''
	   Later in the fall, the 1,125-seat Olivier auditorium must give
itself over to a new staging of Shakespeare's ``Antony and
Cleopatra,'' even as this ``Oklahoma!'' is readied for a longer
commercial life in London and abroad.
	   Its success marks a particular coup for Trevor Nunn, who last
October took over as artistic director of the National, one of the
most important playhouses in the English-speaking theater.
	   Earlier in his career, Nunn had spent 18 years running the Royal
Shakespeare Company. He had directed only one American musical
(``The Baker's Wife,'' a well-reviewed West End flop), making his
name _ and fortune _ staging such British musical behemoths as
``Cats,'' ``Starlight Express,'' ``Les Miserables'' and ``Sunset
Boulevard.''
	   Nunn knows as well as anyone that there will be detractors who
scoff at lavishing taxpayers' money on a genre thought by some to
be essentially frivolous.
	   But he has always believed that musicals represent a ``tried and
tested art form,'' he said in an interview during ``Oklahoma!''
rehearsals.
	   Speaking from the perspective of having directed countless
classic plays and opera as well, Nunn, 58, resists the notion that
``we should do musicals but only esoteric ones, only difficult ones
that require a degree in music to appreciate.''
	   That argument, he feels, ``is not worth having.''
	   The proof in any case is in the production, a point echoed by
Susan Stroman, the American choreographer of this revival who has
twice won Broadway's Tony Award.
	   ``There's something about working at the National Theater that
is very nurturing to the artist,'' Stroman said. ``It's all about
the process, about the art surrounding and creating a play or
musical. Although I am doing an old warhorse, it's being treated as
a new piece.''
	   That's certainly true in Stroman's case. With the exception of
an English touring production several years back that never came to
London, this is the first major ``Oklahoma!'' to dispense with the
groundbreaking choreography of the late and legendary Agnes de
Mille, which includes the dream ballet at the end of the first act.
	   Where most stagings give the so-called ``Dream Sequence'' over
to an alternate Curly and Laurey, Stroman retains the show's
principals for the ballet.
	   ``Having the three leads really grounds the ballet into the
show,'' she said.
	   Both Nunn and Stroman were keen to forego anything folksy about
the material _ vistas of polka dot dresses and daisies included _
in favor of a more truthful, less patronizing approach.
	   For Nunn, that meant going back to the play on which
Hammerstein's libretto is based: Lynn Riggs' ``Green Grow the
Lilacs.''
	   In rehearsals, he says, ``I had the opportunity the first week
to treat it as a play and only as a play.''
	   The cast offers as diverse a mix of talent as the offstage team.
Aunt Eller, the show's feisty representative of common sense mixed
with compassion, is played by Maureen Lipman, a popular English
comedian.
	   Laurey is played by a dancer, Josefina Gabrielle, while Curly is
the strong-voiced Australian, Hugh Jackman, in his English theater
debut.
	   The finest reviews have been for newcomer Shuler Hensley, a
Marietta, Georgia, native who is a brooding revelation as the
anguished farm hand Jud Fry.
	   ``So many times he's just played as a bad guy,'' said Hensley,
speaking from his dressing room the day before the July 15 opening
night that would make him a star.
	   ``What makes this production different is that he's had the bad
breaks rather than that he's ultimately bad.
	   ``I've gotten a lot of feedback from people saying, `I don't
want Jud to die. I feel for him.' That makes the tragedy that much
more important.''

Kevin Spacey: an Oscar-winning `Negotiator' hooked on surprise

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ For almost four months, Kevin Spacey has been
thrilling London theatergoers as a titanic Hickey in a new revival
of Eugene O'Neill's marathon play, ``The Iceman Cometh.''
	   American audiences, in the meantime, can admire his contribution
to thrills of a different sort, as he faces off against Samuel L.
Jackson in what looks to be the summer's most breathlessly exciting
film, ``The Negotiator.''
	   In the movie, Spacey locks screen wits atop a Chicago high-rise
with a fellow hostage negotiator wrongly accused of murder. In
London, he's headlining a 4 1-2 -hour play on stage _ twice on
Saturdays.
	   ``By doing a movie like that,'' Spacey says, ``I can afford to
do this.''
	   ``This'' is the first stage role in almost five years for an
actor who spent two years at New York's Juilliard School before he
embarked on a career playing Chekhov, Shakespeare and Ibsen.
	   ``I mean, I love being able to turn up in places that are
surprising,'' he continues, speaking not 24 hours before he has to
leave London _ and his play _ overnight in order to attend the
movie's July 29 premiere in Los Angeles.
	   In person, he comes across as friendly and talkative, his eyes
far warmer than the chill they memorably cast in films like
``Seven'' and ``The Usual Suspects.''
	   His willingness to do interviews one afternoon at London's Savoy
Hotel contrasts with his reticence throughout the ``Iceman'' run,
during which, he acknowledges, ``I've sort of maintained a vow of
silence.''
	   But in a crowded summer field, films depend on publicity in a
way some plays don't. ``Iceman,'' for example, consistently sold
out on the strength of Spacey's name and the reviews, so it hardly
needed interviews to fan the flames.
	   The actor, who has won both an Academy Award for ``The Usual
Suspects'' and a Tony for ``Lost In Yonkers,'' both for best
supporting actor, knows that mega-budget popcorn movies _ even
smart ones like ``The Negotiator'' _ aren't exactly familiar
terrain for him.
	   ``I think for some people it will be surprising for me to turn
up in a movie like this,'' he says.
	   Then again, he adds, ``For some people, who expect all I should
be doing is movie after movie after movie, it's surprising that I'm
here doing `Iceman.' That's great fun.''
	   What's important, he feels, is to continue to stretch and grow
and not do the expected.
	   ``We tend to live in this environment, particularly in
entertainment, where people want to pigeonhole everybody _ `that's
a leading man; that's a character actor; that's a person who should
only do this because that's what they do.'
	   ``The fact of the matter is actors should be able to explore any
kind of territory, any kind of genre, for me as long as it's
credible,'' he said.
	   ``I'm trying to do a slow shift in film out of that thing of,
`Oh, he always plays dark things; he's always complex and moody.'
People like you sometimes the way they discover you, so I'm trying
to make a change.''
	   Besides, one could argue that F. Gary Gray's intense thriller
represents summer fare at its most astute. It's full of gunfire and
crowd scenes, to be sure, but also offers well-developed characters
and opportunities for actors not to be eclipsed by the special
effects.
	   ``I wanted to try to see if I could do a big commercial action
movie that I could live with myself in the morning about,'' says
Spacey, whose experience of such films has been limited to
supporting roles in, among others, the virus movie ``Outbreak.''
	   Indeed, it was his brief partnering with Jackson two summers ago
in the box-office smash ``A Time to Kill'' that persuaded Spacey to
sign on, especially since the two men had known each other for
years when they were trawling the New York theater circuit.
	   ``A Time to Kill,'' says Spacey, ``was like a little taste of,
`Hey, this is something interesting.' We had this tiny scene
together, but it wasn't particularly satisfying.''
	   So when Sylvester Stallone bowed out of ``The Negotiator,''
Spacey says, he and Jackson were happy to step in.
	   ``Fortunately, Sam said, `I'll do it if Kevin does it.' I said,
`I'll do it if Sam does it.' We had been talking for a while about
trying to find something, and this seemed like the perfect
opportunity.''
	   Besides Jackson, ``The Negotiator'' features other actors
steeped in the theater _ Paul Giamatti, David Morse and 1998
Tony-winner Ron Rifkin (``Cabaret'') among them.
	   The result? ``The producer allowed us to bring the whole company
to Chicago and rehearse so that we had the opportunity to ask all
those questions (you would ask in a play) about logic, character
motivation, what drives something, so that when you get on a set of
a movie like that with explosives and everything going on, you
don't have this huge gaping logic where the audience goes,
`What?'''
	   Spacey cares passionately about audience response, as befits an
actor who scheduled an extra ``Iceman Cometh'' matinee _ on July
26, his 39th birthday no less _ so as to accommodate the nearly
1,000 theatergoers who suffered the production's one canceled
performance.
	   His mix of film and stage looks set to continue.
	   Still to come: the movie version of David Rabe's play,
``Hurlyburly,'' in which Spacey appeared on Broadway, co-starring
his friend Sean Penn; Spacey plans to go to Ireland to do a film in
the fall.
	   Next spring, he hopes to star in (and co-produce) a Broadway
``Iceman Cometh.''
	   ``I'd certainly like to go and share it there, because it's so
rarely done,'' he says.

He's got Legos _ he knows how to use them

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ F. Gary Gray feels like he's worked with his
best set of Legos yet.
	   The 29-year-old director says one of his earliest displays of
creativity came from ``a big suitcase full of Lego building
blocks'' and he likens filmmaking to working with them.
	   ``You take what you have and you make what you can with it,'' he
says. ``Same thing with Legos. You have a vision. And you say, `OK,
I'm going to build this truck. And I may not necessarily have all
the pieces, but I'm going to do my best to build what I envision
with the resources I have.'''
	   After working with a mere dlrs 2 million budget for ``Friday,''
his hilarious 1995 feature debut that grossed about dlrs 30
million, then about dlrs 9 million for ``Set It Off,'' which made
dlrs 13 million in its first week alone, Gray received about dlrs
50 million to make his newest movie, ``The Negotiator,'' starring
Samuel L. Jackson and Kevin Spacey.
	   ``Legos are getting better and better,'' Gray says.
	   More money didn't mean more pressure for Gray. The only pressure
he admits to is wanting to deliver what the audience expects from
actors of Jackson's and Spacey's caliber _ ``and that's something
really smart.''
	   What pressure he does feel is vented on dirt bikes and
motorcycles, which is why he has a hook jutting from his thumb. He
broke the digit in a riding accident and he needed a pin
temporarily implanted. It's not the latest in body piercing, he
assures an interviewer.
	   Success is no surprise to Gray, a young man who's had his eye on
the prize since age 15 when he decided he wanted to become a
director.
	   Before he turned 20 he was freelancing as a TV news cameraman,
making dlrs 250 a day while getting his footage on Fox, CNN, E! and
BET. He socked away enough money to finance a short film, which led
to directing music videos.
	   Among them: Coolio's ``Fantastic Voyage,'' TLC's ``Waterfalls,''
Dr. Dre's ``Keep Their Heads Ringin''' and Ice Cube's ``It Was a
Good Day,'' one of Rolling Stone magazine's top 100 all-time
videos. Also, Gray received a Grammy nomination for directing
Stevie Wonder and Babyface's ``How Come, How Long.''
	   Born in Manhattan while his parents were vacationing from
Illinois, and raised in South Central Los Angeles after they split
up when he was 2, Gray returned to Illinois to live with his father
and attend high school in Highland Park.
	   ``I remember moving in that day and we had a long talk and he
says, `I love you and I really want you to be the best you can be.
And more than treating this like a father-son relationship, I want
to treat this like we're roommates,''' Gray recalls.
	   And he thinks his father's expectation that he act like a
responsible young man ``gave me the freedom to do my thing and
discover myself a lot earlier than my peers.''
	   ``I was an adult maybe a lot earlier than the average person.
Some say that's good; some say maybe that's not so good. But it's
really worked for me,'' Gray says.
	   ``I think the reason why I'm here today is because I took the
time early to identify what I like and I was fortunate to identify
what I like and build. It's been 14 years of interest and work and
hands-on training in this industry and in television that has
helped me get to this point.''
	   Gray's first movie focused on two homeboys (Ice Cube and Chris
Tucker) whose attempts to chill on a porch keep getting
interrupted; his second dealt with four women (including Queen
Latifah and Jada Pinkett Smith) who form a bank-robbing gang to
defy what they see as oppression. ``The Negotiator'' is driven by
the plight of a man (Jackson) simply trying to prove himself
innocent.
	   ``And that alone can stand on its own. We didn't need any race
cards to pull or any type of political messages or points to
make,'' Gray says. ``Because I think there's an arena for that.''
	   Unlike some other black directors, Grays says that arena is his
personal life so he doesn't need to use his films as a soapbox.
	   ``I don't want every time you turn on an F. Gary Gray film ...
that you have to find yourself politically positioning yourself,''
he says. ``It just doesn't apply right now for the stories I'm
trying to tell.''

Fruit and vegetable artist follows own furrow

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A field of pumpkins inspired Frenchman Alain
Bellanger to give up his job in a cigarette factory after 13 years
and become an artist.
	   ``I liked the appearance of the pumpkins so much that I wanted
to paint them, and I felt I could,'' he said. ``I did, but it took
me much longer to learn how to paint the leaves than the
pumpkins.''
	   Bellanger is a house painter's son who never was trained as an
artist, never studied art and is uninfluenced by the work of
others.
	   He makes a living from painting pumpkins and a host of other
vegetables and fruit _ beet root, leeks, cabbages, apples,
watermelons. He also paints sunflowers and wildflowers such as
hogweed, common in French and English hedgerows, with its tall
stems topped by spreading heads of tiny flowers and the sun shining
through.
	   Bellanger doesn't have to go far to find his subjects. They grow
all around his home near the Creuse River in the Berry region of
central France.
	   His pictures might not sound too exciting, but in a gallery in
London's smart art-dealing center of St. James, they found both
admiration and buyers, who paid 750 pounds (dlrs 1,220) for apples,
900 pounds (dlrs 1,460) for cherries and 1,200 pounds (dlrs 1,950)
for grapes.
	   ``They are very beautiful,'' said Stephen Jack, director of
Polak fine art dealers, who mounted Bellanger's first solo show in
London. ``I've never seen anything like them, and nor have my
customers.''
	   Bellanger, 45, uses oil-based pastels applied so thickly that
his works resemble oil paintings on canvas, although they are all
on paper.
	   He doesn't go in for the kind of stiff botanical drawings in
books on identifying plants or the usual still lifes with fruits
formally assembled into a group.
	   He prefers a congregation of one kind of plant in its natural
state _ sunflowers standing in a field with their petals, seed
heads and leaves all a-tumble, a mass of cherries in a pile after
being picked, or windfallen apples in clumps on the grass.
	   His vigorous and vibrant pictures fill the frame and seem to
overflow it with the natural energy of the subjects.
	   But Bellanger doesn't prettify anything: He likes to portray his
subjects at the moment when their freshness starts to fade. He
won't ignore the first browning sign of rot on the skins of apples.
	   ``I like decay,'' he said in an interview in London. ``I think
decay is beautiful. I've been painting it for 10 years and it's
never the same picture twice.''
	   Bellanger, whose first solo show in New York City is scheduled
for March, spends much of his time wandering in orchards and fields
for inspiration.
	   ``I spend a long time studying and touching plants. You cannot
paint something unless you know how it feels. I get down on my
knees to handle things as they grow,'' he said.
	   ``Some leaves are smooth, others are smooth on one side and
rough on the other, and to know that plant, you have to feel it.
You have to roll an onion around in your hand. You must kneel down
to the grass to see how the daisies push up to the sun.''
	   His financee, Sophie Dumas, said Bellanger is a walking
encyclopedia of botany.
	   ``Alain knows all the varieties of each plant, all their names
and how their seeds look, not just the mature plants,'' she said.
``He has a woman friend who grows specific varieties for him which
he wants to paint, such as cabbage. But men don't show any interest
at all.''
	   Do farmers ever ask him to paint their fruit and vegetables?
	   ``Never,'' Bellanger said. ``They see my pictures and they think
I'm crazy.''
	   He said his favorite vegetable is probably the leek, which grows
from a bulb and has white stems, large and floppy outside leaves
and a mild onion taste.
	   But he's not sentimental about his subjects. He eats them, as
part of his learning process.
	   ``I'm a cannibal artist,'' he said with a laugh.

United States takes 5 1/2-3 1/2 lead in Curtis Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) _ Kellee Booth, Brenda Corrie-Kuehn and Beth
Bauer won singles matches Saturday to give the United States a 5
1/2-3 1/2 lead over Great Britain and Ireland after the first day
of the 30th Curtis Cup.
	   ``I have to admit, I was the most nervous person out there,''
U.S. captain Barbara McIntire said. ``It's easier to be calmer if
your have a little bit of a lead. This is not a big lead, believe
me.''
	   Great Britain and Ireland closed within two points when Becky
Morgan and Elaine Ratcliffe won the final two matches Saturday in
the two-day biennial competition at The Minikahda Club course.
	   ``We finished on a high note,'' GBI captain Ita Butler said.
``Our players didn't give up, they kept trying. It's great to see
that spirit. We're all quite optimistic at this point.''
	   In the day's most-watched competition, U.S. Women's Open playoff
loser Jenny Chuasiriporn rallied from four holes down to halve her
match with British Amateur champion Rebecca Hudson.
	   ``I was thinking just one shot at a time,'' Chuasiriporn said.
``I'm glad to halve the match after starting so poorly.''
	   Hudson, 19, is the youngest member of the GBI team.
	   ``Jenny is a great golfer, I knew she had the ability,'' Hudson
said. ``She had some very good putts.''
	   Bauer, who will join Chuasiriporn at Duke University this fall,
beat Hillary Monaghan 5 and 3. Booth defeated Kim Rostron 2 and 1,
and Corrie-Kuehn beat Alison Rose 3 and 2. In the final two
matches, Morgan beat Jo Jo Robertson 2 and 1, and Ratcliffe edged
Carole Semple Thompson 3 and 2.
	   The United States took a 2-1 lead in the morning foursomes.
	   Corrie-Kuehn and Booth beat Fiona Brown and Karen Stupples 2 and
1, and Virginia Derby-Grimes and Robin Burke edged Rose and Morgan
3 and 2. Rostron and Ratcliffe beat Bauer and Chuasiriporn 1-up.
	   Great Britain and Ireland won two years ago in Killarney,
Ireland, giving it a win or a tie in five of the last six meetings.
The United States leads the series 20-6-3.

`Trio' vets Emmylou Harris, Dolly Parton follow different paths
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Photo NS201 &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM PATTERSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NASHVILLE, Tennessee (AP) _ Dolly Parton and Emmylou Harris had
big-time commercial success together with the ``Trio'' album they
did in 1987 with Linda Ronstadt. It produced four Top 10 hits,
including the No. 1 ``To Know Him Is To Love Him.''
	   They tried a few years back to do another one, but their
schedules clashed. Now both have new albums out. Parton hasn't had
a hit in years. Harris says she stopped worrying about that a long
time ago.
	   Parton has kept busy. She has her East Tennessee theme park
Dollywood to promote and for a long time has been working on a
musical about her life. She hopes to take it to Broadway.
	   She has also been trying for years to develop a network
television show. One idea she had was to play an angel that comes
to Earth to do good works. She was scooped by CBS' ``Touched by an
Angel.''
	   Among Harris' upcoming projects is a tribute album to her
mentor, Gram Parsons, an album of new music, and probably a duet
album with Ronstadt.
	   A second ``Trio'' album is still on the back burner.
	   Both women recently talked about their projects and their
careers with The Associated Press.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; DOLLY PARTON &QC; 
	   Dolly Parton strides into the spacious lounge of her Nashville
office, showing off that famous figure in a tight-fitting denim
ensemble.
	   At 52, she looks as though she just stepped off a 20-year-old
album cover: big hair, big chest, wide smile, heavy makeup.
	   The difference is her absence from the top of the charts. As
Parton says in a spoken-word introduction on her new album,
``Hungry Again'': ``I'm still hungry for hit records.''
	   Parton has been starving for a while now. Her last album,
``Treasures,'' tanked. The strategy then was to record familiar Top
40 hits like ``Walking on Sunshine'' and ``Peace Train.''
	   But she is focused on her goal _ to get back on the charts. She
spent part of last summer fasting, which she says got her in the
mood to write country songs again.
	   ``I wanted to try one more time in country music and see if they
could find a place for me on country radio and in the business,''
she says.
	   On that spoken-word introduction, Parton gets downright meek.
She says she's serving up the ``Hungry Again'' album ``with a big
ole piece of humble pie.''
	   Parton started out as a child star in her native East Tennessee,
moved to Nashville after graduating from high school and became the
protege of flashy country star Porter Wagoner in the late 1960s.
She became a movie and pop music star after leaving Wagoner in
1974.
	   She is one of the most celebrated and recognizable stars in any
musical genre. She has written more than a thousand songs,
including ``Coat of Many Colors'' and ``I Will Always Love You.''
Parton scored 23 No. 1 country hits from 1970-91. Today, she
records for Decca, a division of MCA.
	   ``Hungry Again'' was largely recorded at the home studio of
Parton's cousin, Richie Owens, of the band Shinola. The song
``Hungry Again'' calls for putting passion back into a marriage,
and she says it's how she feels about her music career.
	   ``Hungry Again'' is extremely well-crafted. Parton's voice is as
perky and clear as ever, and decades of singing haven't diminished
her vocal range.
	   There's nothing stopping Parton from again scoring the hits she
wants so badly, provided she overcomes the age discrimination that
has victimized many older country stars.
	   ``There's two things that are selling,'' Parton says. ``That's
the stuff people are dancing to or it's the real heartfelt true
traditional-type things, and I figured I'd be better off to do what
I understand.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; EMMYLOU HARRIS &QC; 
	   Emmylou Harris greets a series of interviewers in a small suite
at Spence Manor, a hotel on Nashville's Music Row.
	   She makes small talk about a low-power Nashville radio station
she likes that followed some Sinatra music with a block of James
Brown hits.
	   Her luxurious gray hair flows past her shoulders and falls on a
simple, elegant black dress.
	   Harris, 51, does not look like one of her 1970s album covers,
nor does she attempt to. Her still-beautiful face has aged, as has
her once pure soprano.
	   ``I've got more tread marks,'' Harris says, without regret.
	   At times on her new live album ``Spyboy,'' Harris goes raspy
when she reaches for high notes. Sometimes, the words are hard to
understand, though they're sung with passion.
	   Fusing material from a 25-year song catalog with a seductive
sound developed with producer Daniel Lanois on her 1995 album
``Wrecking Ball,'' the live album is triumphant.
	   Harris, the daughter of a Navy admiral, was singing folk music
in Washington, D.C., when she was taken on as a protege by
groundbreaking country-rock singer Gram Parsons in the early 1970s.
She has always been left-of-center for Nashville, but enjoyed a
15-year run of hits starting in 1975 including seven No. 1's.
	   ``When I was having hits, it seemed like they were coming from a
total disregard of having hits,'' Harris said. ``We just did the
records, and at that point radio was a bit more open and we had
hits. But what was being established was a constituency that was
buying the records.
	   ``Plus I had a really good base overseas, and those people don't
give a fig for hits. And I think my basic audience here is
album-orientated also.''
	   Playing the Lilith Fair concerts last year was a revelation to
Harris, and she's joining the all-female tour again this summer.
	   ``It's almost the perfect touring vehicle,'' she says. ``You
play short sets, and you play to people who may not have any idea
about you but they are responsive to everything that they hear.
There's a good chance they might really like what you do and be
interested in checking it out.''
	   ``Spyboy'' is being released by Eminent Records, a small
independent label set up by Harris' manager Monty Hitchcock. She
will be seeking a major-label deal for her next album.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Everybody knows all you need for a hit sitcom is
a stand-up comic with a ready-made persona.
	   Network execs know it, and they dream of launching the next
``Seinfeld'' or ``Drew Carey.'' Producers know it, and they dream
of signing the next Seinfeld or Drew Carey. Stand-up comics know
it, and they dream of being the next Seinfeld or Drew Carey.
	   Viewers may suspect it's not quite that simple. But what do they
know?
	   So the long and winding road to TV stardom takes a looping
detour through Montreal each summer, where Just for Laughs, billed
as the largest comedy festival in the world, is open for funny
business.
	   Phoning from the festival, which ended July 26, Don Rickles
described the drill: ``You take young, struggling comedians and put
'em in a showcase, and agents and television people come and see
them, and all of a sudden they've got a hit series and they go from
dlrs 5 to 20 million. And then I run alongside their car trying to
get their picture.''
	   Again, it's not quite that simple _ though who would dare argue
with Mr. Rickles? And, granted, Just for Laughs did play a key role
in fulfilling the sitcom destinies of Tim Allen, Brett Butler and
that chap Jerry Seinfeld.
	   But someone scoring with a stand-up act may go on to lay goose
eggs in the series it inspires. Consider Just for Laughs alums like
Lenny Clarke, whose ``Lenny'' lasted just a few months during the
1990-91 season, and John Mendoza, who flopped with ``The Second
Half'' in 1993-94.
	   And of course there's Rickles, one of the most enduring
headliners as a stand-up, who over the years has bombed in at least
three sitcoms.
	   ``It's always been hard to find writers for me in a sitcom,'' he
acknowledged. ``What I do, when I do it, it comes out funny. When
someone else tries to write it, it comes out overkill.''
	   Bobby Slayton, a stand-up who portrays veteran comic Joey Bishop
in HBO's upcoming ``Rat Pack'' film, views sitcom-lust with a
jaundiced eye.
	   ``I could give a (rodent's hind-section) about having a
television show,'' he erupted with mock contempt. ``Why? Because
television's just so horrible and so awful. People say, 'What about
``Seinfeld''?' Yeah, and I'd like to win a billion dollars in the
lottery also.''
	   Slayton halted this rant to catch his breath. ``I say that now
to you, because I know you can't help me,'' he leveled slyly. ``If
there's some executive who says `We want to write a show about
you,' I'd say, `Sure.'''
	   Ray Romano may squirm a little when congratulated for making it
in TV: ``Why are you trying to jinx me?''
	   But with ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' heading into its third
season, he agreed that Just for Laughs led to his successful CBS
sitcom. ``It put me out there for people to see.''
	   Even so, when Romano started in the early 1980s, TV wasn't a
comedian's focus. ``Become a stand-up, somebody sees you, you get a
development deal _ that wasn't the rule. For the first 10 years, I
was just concerned with stand-up. Then I saw TV was the next
stop.''
	   And maybe the stop after that. John Henson, a former stand-up
already flush with a TV series, admitted he was appearing at the
festival ``to see what's out there in the marketplace.
	   ``I'm coming up towards that crossroads where you start looking
for that next thing,'' noted the host of E! Entertainment's ``Talk
Soup'' _ ``and this might be the opportunity to find it.''
	   Meanwhile, for Gilbert Gottfried, hardly a newcomer to the
comedy business yet never a star in a series, hope springs eternal.
	   ``I want to be the next `Ellen,''' he said, reasoning, ``I'm
also sexually attracted to women. I figure maybe they can build a
whole series around that for me.''
	   If they ever build a whole series around newcomer Zach
Galifianakis, he'll need those new wide-screen TVs for his last
name.
	   A native of North Carolina, Galifianakis moved to Manhattan six
years ago to study acting. Then he tried stand-up. (As an example
of his act, he listed a few things you would never hear uttered at
his bachelor pad: ``Yummy! Fresh milk!'' ... ``Who dog-eared my
Bible?'' ... ``How was your date?'' ... ``What's on PBS?'' ...
``Let's go see `Riverdance'!'')
	   He was a regular on ``an MTV show no one saw,'' got a guest shot
on the short-lived sitcom ``Boston Common,'' and did a pilot no one
picked up.
	   ``If I ever get a TV deal,'' vowed Galifianakis, now 26, ``I
would love to confront issues that people don't want to talk about
anymore. `Seinfeld' was great, but I would like to do something on
television that is NOT about nothing.''
	   Then he paused for a reality check and a punch line. ``Who am I
kidding? My main goal in TV is to have a role where I don't have to
say `Du-u-ude!'''

`Lolita' star Jeremy Irons: It's good if it disturbs you
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; AP Television Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The notion of a grown man having sex with a
preteen girl, even in fiction, gets people going. Maybe they're
outraged. Maybe squeamish. Maybe they don't know what they feel,
and don't want to find out.
	   But none of this is news. Recall that in the mid-1950s,
``Lolita,'' a novel soberly exploring the subject of pedophilia,
was shunned by American publishers for four years. Too
controversial.
	   Now the Vladimir Nabokov classic is graced with a new film
adaptation. Directed by Adrian Lyne (``Indecent Proposal''), it
stars Dominique Swain as the notorious nymphet and Jeremy Irons as
the obsessed suitor three times her age. It, too, is controversial.
Despite the film's release in Europe last summer, distributors
shied from booking it in U.S. theaters.
	   Thanks to the Showtime cable network, ``Lolita'' is finally
here. Besides a Showtime-arranged theatrical release, the film
comes will be seen on U.S. television this month. Now you can
decide for yourself whether to watch it, and, if you watch it,
whether it deserves all the ruckus.
	   Jeremy Irons, the Oscar-winning star of provocative films like
``Dead Ringers'' and ``Reversal of Fortune,'' thinks not.
	   ``Yes, `Lolita' deals with a controversial subject,'' he was
saying earlier this week, ``and anything which is seen to be
possibly promoting it, encouraging it or condoning it, I think,
makes us very nervous.
	   ``But now that people are beginning to see the film, they're
beginning to say, 'I don't know what the fuss is about.'''
	   So why does this ``Lolita,'' like the 1954 novel and the 1962
film, perplex people? And what accounts for the aversion to this
particular ``crime film,'' when such righteous standards
consistently applied would leave little more on screens than the
trailer that sells popcorn?
	   ``Most child abuse cases are within the family,'' Irons says,
lighting a Silk Cut and groping for an answer. ``It's a crime that
happens behind closed doors. That's very hard to police. So, even
though it goes on, we make it a huge taboo.''
	   Of course, the fact of that taboo is what gives ``Lolita'' its
tragic force. Behold Humbert Humbert, the middle-aged wretch who
sees his liaison with 12-year-old Lolita as a way to repair his own
damaged youth. His is an unpardonable, yet not unfathomable,
yearning.
	   But be forewarned: Those braced or eager for kiddie porn will be
disappointed.
	   If anything, ``Lolita'' is demure. There is almost nothing
sexually explicit in this film, no sights or behavior you couldn't
find on any broadcast network on any night. And far from licking
its chops over its demented love story, the film dwells on love
unfulfilled.
	   Responding to one critic's complaint that the film fails as
erotica, Irons says, ``Well, I think you know what's going on. I
don't think you need to show it.''
	   Indeed, the power is in what's left unshown, what the film sets
unreeling inside of you. There, if anywhere, is where the ugliness
resides. ``Lolita'' shocking? Nothing it displays will infect you
with thoughts and urges you don't already have. Those, not the
film, are liable to be shocking.
	   ``It makes you aware that there is a latent criminal in all of
us,'' says Irons, ``and therefore, people who do fail are not
different to us. They're just people like us who've failed. I
dislike the terms 'them' and 'us.'''
	   Craven exploitation, forbidden love: These are timeless themes.
But another _ the cultural obsession with youth _ makes ``Lolita''
more relevant, and perhaps more disturbing, today than when it
first appeared.
	   ``Lolita'' is set in 1947, ``before the invention of the great
American teen-ager,'' in the words of Stephen Schiff, its
screenwriter. But these days, the marketplace woos demographics
that ``skew young.'' Youth drives the market, which drives cultural
values.
	   ``All of us are surrounded by the titillation of youth,'' Irons
says. ``And the people who lead our society are the guys who make
money out of selling us things, and they're telling us to have a
good time as we spend money on products to keep young.''
	   Wherever you turn, you are obliged to feel young, act young,
embrace all things youthful, in order to retain your good standing
in society. And at any cost.
	   Would you ever force yourself on Lolita? Irons says ``Lolita''
is a challenge to resist.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ No. 1 will play for the women's gold medal, but
No. 2 will not. Holly McPeak and Lisa Arce of Manhattan Beach,
California, were upset in the semifinals by Australia's Julian
Manser and Kerri Pottharst 12-11, 11-12, 12-6. McPeak and Arce
wasted two set points in the first set, battled back from a 10-3
deficit to win the second, but gave up the final five points in the
third. Manser and Pottharst will play for the title against
top-ranked Shelda Bede and Adriana Behar of Brazil, winners over

Jenny Thompson and Cristina Teuscher, won the first six events
against Germany and went on to a 78-44 victory, its third straight
dual-meet win, to take the gold medal. The title is worth dlrs
50,000 to the winning team, and since only four of the 18 team
members _ Thompson, Lea Maurer, Richelle Fox and Ashley Tappin _
are out of college, those four get to share the loot. Teuscher won

100 freestyle and swam a leg of the winning medley relay.

	   In the spotlight: Martha Stewart
	    &UR; Personal Stats: Martha Koystra was raised in Nutley, New
Jersey. Her mother, a schoolteacher and homemaker, taught her the
basics of cooking, baking, canning and sewing. Her father, a
pharmaceutical salesman and avid gardener, introduced her to
gardening when she was 3. Her family had a small but orderly
backyard plot.
	    &UR; A guru is born: While attending Barnard College, where she
earned a bachelor's degree in history and architectural history,
she began modeling to help pay her tuition. After graduation, she
became a Wall Street stockbroker. She later moved to Westport,
Connecticut, with her husband, Andrew Stewart, and daughter,
Alexis, to begin the catering business that would launch her career
as an arbiter of taste. Her first book, ``Entertaining,'' which
started Martha mania in 1982, is in its 30th printing.
	   Stewart, who is 57 on Aug. 3, currently serves as chairwoman and
chief executive of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia LLC. Last
September, she began producing and serving as host for ``Martha
Stewart Living'' on CBS six days a week. The series covers topics
from refinishing furniture to building a garden trellis to simple
ways to serve figs. Stewart was named one of ``America's 25 Most
Influential People'' by Time magazine in June 1996.
	    &UR; Image: Despite her fastidiousness and her patrician bearing _
which have prompted numerous sendups on television's ``Saturday
Night Live'' and a ``Mad About Martha'' book of paper dolls _
Stewart manages to give her audience the sense that she is one of
them. ``I am first and foremost a housewife with a home, with a
garden, with everything that everybody wants,'' she says.
	    &UR; Among her many ventures: A line of paints; a mail-order
catalog; a magazine; a line of bed and bath products; a 90-second
daily radio feature; and a syndicated newspaper column.
	   On her one-woman branding spree, Stewart says: ``Why not take
good messages to less fortunate people?''

Five Questions with Natalie Imbruglia: former Australian soap opera
</HEADLINE>
star now a rookie singer &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photo NY359 &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID BAUDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Wandering down the hallway of a Manhattan record
company, Natalie Imbruglia barely blinks when she glances into an
office and sees her face staring back.
	   It's not her reflection in a mirror, just another magazine cover
that has succumbed to this 24-year-old's pouty good looks.
	   The former teen-age star of an Australian television soap opera
is used to such attention. What's new is that this is a music
magazine. In the United States, where nobody saw her acting in
``Neighbours,'' she's just another rookie singer.
	   That's fine by Imbruglia. Her heart was in music, not acting,
when she quit the soap opera five years ago and moved to London to
try and make it as a singer.
	   She succeeded on her first effort, ``Torn,'' an ode to a
disintegrating relationship sweetened with one of the
hardest-to-shake musical hooks of the year. While it goes down easy
enough for young fans of the Spice Girls, it's more than just a
guilty pleasure for older fans.
	   Imbruglia's television presence was put to good use in the
song's video, a soap opera in itself that shows the star trying to
work around an annoying boyfriend. It doesn't hurt that most
viewers, particularly men, just want to scoop her up and comfort
her.
	   The experience of being a teen-age star _ even if at a lesser
magnitude _ is also apparent in her businesslike attitude toward
interviews. She's not cynical, not quite yet, but already has that
practiced distance that other musicians take years to develop.
	   1. What made you decide to leave acting for music?
	   Imbruglia: I started singing when I was 13 years old, so I
always wanted to do it. Basically, when I was in high school, I got
an acting agent and that started taking off. I got called into a
lot of auditions. I guess I sort of got sidetracked and I wasn't
thinking of a career plan. The kind of music I liked was very
mature and I was 14, so it wouldn't have worked, anyway.
	   2. Who were the musicians that you admired?
	   Imbruglia: The first artist that I really connected with was
Joni Mitchell. That was later on. As a kid I was really into
whatever was in the Top 40. I really loved The Carpenters. I didn't
have any one particular person that was my role model. When I was a
teen-ager, it was the Violent Femmes, because I was going through a
rebellious stage. But I never really got passionate about anything
until Joni Mitchell.
	   3. As somebody who writes songs, is it difficult to have the
first song that people associate with you be not written by you?
(``Torn'' was written by Phil Thornalley, Anne Preven and Scott
Cutler.)
	   Imbruglia: I think I dealt with that before I chose it, because
I could have chosen one of mine. I love that song, and I made it my
own. I'm so grateful to Anne Preven and Phil Thornalley for having
written that song, which fell into my hands. I would only do
somebody's song if I loved it that much, and then when you feel
that way about a song, it doesn't really matter if you didn't write
it.
	   4. What do you think it is about ``Torn'' that has made it so
appealing to people?
	   Imbruglia: It's instant. You never tire of hearing it. Well, I
haven't yet. I think the fact that it's a really sweet melody and
then you realize the words and content is really quite heavy. I
like that bittersweet thing.
	   5. Do you think fans want to know more about you as a person
than you are willing to tell?
	   Imbruglia: Definitely. I think that it's nice to have a bit of a
distance there. The people that I love and admire, I don't know
exactly what went on in their songs. I can guess. I can guess their
experiences but what is most important is how it relates to my
life.

	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ U.S. women swimmers got the gold, and
four team members got the money Saturday night.
	   The American team, led by Jenny Thompson and Cristina Teuscher,
won the first six events against Germany and went on to a 78-44
victory, its third straight dual-meet win at the Goodwill Games.
	   The gold medal is worth dlrs 50,000 to the winning team, and
since only four of the 18 team members are out of college, those
four get to share the loot.
	   Thompson of Dover, New Hampshire; captain Lea Maurer of
Crestwood, New York; Richelle Fox of Scotia, New York; and Ashley
Tappin of New Orleans will take home dlrs 12,500 each for the team
gold medal.
	   With an additional dlrs 1,000 going to the best time in each
event during the three dual meets, Thompson had a chance _ pending
the World Team-China meet later Saturday _ to win a total of dlrs
15,500 and five gold medals.
	   Teuscher, of New Rochelle, New York, ineligible for prize money
because she still attends Columbia, won the 200 freestyle and the
200 individual medley against Germany. She had a chance to join
Thompson with five gold medals: the team gold, the 800 and 400
freestyles, the 200 IM and the freestyle relay.
	   Thompson won the 100 freestyle and swam a leg of the winning 400
medley relay against Germany.
	   Saturday night's U.S. freestyle relay team was disqualified for
an early start, but Teuscher and Thompson still had the fastest
pending relay time earlier in the week.
	   Even with the disqualification, the United States won 10 of the
14 events against the Germans.
	   Going into the World Team-China match, Thompson had the best
time of the week in the 100 freestyle, 100 butterfly and two
relays. She would have to split the dlrs 2,000 in relay money with
Tappin and Fox.
	   Maurer, with the best pending time in the 100 backstroke, stood
to win an additional dlrs 1,000, while Fox and Tappin could win
another dlrs 500 for their relay shares.
	   Figure skating finished, and the ice dance gold medal went to
Russia's world champion team of Anjelika Krylova and Oleg
Ovsiannikov.
	   A large crowd at Nassau Coliseum_ including former President
Jimmy Carter _ cheered Krylova and Ovsiannikov through their
energetic free dance, which earned two perfect scores.
	   The silver medal went to another Russian couple, Irina Lobacheva
and Ilia Averbukh, with Elena Grushina and Rusian Goncharov of
Ukraine taking the bronze.
	   The dream matchup in women's beach volleyball fell one match
short.
	   Holly McPeak and Lisa Arce, the No. 2 team, were upset by
Australia's Kerri Pottharst and Pauline Manser, 12-11, 11-12, 12-6,
in the semifinals.
	   That deprived the games of a final-day gold-medal meeting
between the top two teams. The No. 1 duo, Brazil's Shelda Bede and
Adriana Behar, made it with a 12-5, 12-7 victory over Laura
Bruschini and Annamaria Solazzi of Italy.
	   McPeak and Arce have won three international tournaments and
finished second in last year's world championship. After
squandering two set points in the opener, they put together an
impressive rally from 10-3 down to win the second set, but never
were really in the decisive set, which was played under rally rules
_ a point on every serve.
	   The U.S. team led 3-2 in the third set, but the Australians took
the lead for good with the next three points, then closed out the
match by scoring the last five points.
	   This was the first match of either the men's or women's
competition to go to the deciding set.

Hollywood up to its neck in gore as audiences scream for more
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo LA301 &QL; 
 &UR; By MICHAEL FLEEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Entertainment Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ A deranged killer is back and Hollywood
couldn't be happier.
	   Twenty years have passed since knife-wielding psycho Michael
Myers tormented a then-unknown actress named Jamie Lee Curtis in
the original low-budget slice-and-dice flick ``Halloween,'' leaving
audiences screaming in fear _ and screaming for more.
	   Hollywood churned out a frightening number of ``Halloweens'' and
``Nightmares on Elm Street'' in the years that followed before teen
horror finally appeared dead and buried. That was until ``Scream''
reinvented the squeal two years ago by poking fun at the genre,
making dlrs 103 million along the way.
	   Sensing more blood money to be made, Hollywood is once again up
to its neck in gore. And another wave of slasher films is on the
way, led by the 20th-anniversary homage to horror, ``Halloween
H20,'' opening Aug. 4, with Curtis reprising her role as the
terrified Laurie Strode, and Michael back in all his masked
malevolence.
	   Also lurking are ``Urban Legend'' (Oct. 9); ``Bride of Chucky,''
the latest Chucky-the-doll movie (Oct. 16); and the sequel to ``I
Know What You Did Last Summer'' called ``I Still Know What You Did
Last Summer'' (Nov. 20).
	   Out early next year are a deathly comedy called ``Killing Mrs.
Tingle'' and ``Carrie II,'' with Amy Irving returning as a survivor
of the prom-night massacre in the 1976 movie. The third installment
of ``Scream'' is in the works and Miramax's B-movie arm Dimension
Films announced recently it plans to turn the Ghosting comic books
into a movie franchise.
	   Knifing its way to the front of the pack is ``Halloween H20,''
the Miramax movie that sent shivers of fright through a rival
studio. Universal bounced ``Virus,'' coincidentally also starring
Curtis, from the same weekend as the opening of ``Halloween H20''
to January 1999, leaving Universal with no big-budget summer movie.
	   Despite the high expectations, the makers of ``Halloween H20''
had a tough challenge: Keep the genre fresh after it was so
effectively skewered in the hiply self-aware ``Scream,'' which took
jabs at ``Halloween'' and Curtis' Laurie Strode.
	   ``'Scream' hasn't ruined the genre. It's just the opposite,''
said ``Halloween H20'' director Steve C. Miner, a veteran of the
``Friday the 13th'' movies. ``Scary suspenseful scenes are going to
work whether we're aware of them or not. The idea of this movie was
not to go on to the next step of poking more fun at it, but to go
back to the classic, scary, suspenseful scenes.''
	   And so we have Laurie Strode, now with her own teen-age son,
working as the head mistress of a private school, which is _
surprise! _ in an isolated location that is very dark at night,
protected by only one security guard. And who should come back into
her life, but Michael. And he's not happy.
	   Miss Curtis, who got her start in Hollywood with horror movies
before reaching stardom with ``Trading Places'' and ``A Fish Called
Wanda,'' led the effort to make ``Halloween H20.''
	   ``It seemed to me like such a landmark anniversary that it
really demanded either a reissue of the first movie or a whole new
movie,'' said Miss Curtis.
	   She looks back on her early horror work with pride and, when
deciding to make a new movie, had no intention of satirizing the
original John Carpenter-directed ``Halloween.''
	   ``The challenge is to make a good movie,'' she said. ``If you
look at 'Halloween,' it's the simplicity of the story: The realness
of the characters, the isolation of this little girl _ it's a very
simple story.
	   ``I wanted this movie to be a direct descendant of the first
movie, and that's what we have.''
	   In updating ``Carrie'' for the post-''Scream'' era, director
Katt Shea, who cut her teeth on Roger Corman's low-budget horror
movies, said she tried to avoid cliches and focus on the film's
powerful themes of revenge, fear and losing control. The key to
making terror work, she said, is striving for quality.
	   Slasher movies will have to become ``more artistic, more
eloquent in the cinematic language,'' she said. They will have to
be ``more dramatic _ and deeply dramatic _ not just scary. It has
to be something that touches the soul.''

At the Movies: 'The Negotiator'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NIKI KAPSAMBELIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ One of Hollywood's most redeeming qualities is
that even when a studio churns out a completely formulaic,
paint-by-numbers movie, you can sometimes find a gem of a
performance by a truly gifted actor.
	   After all, Jodie Foster won her first Academy Award as the
blue-collar rape victim in ``The Accused,'' an otherwise
underwhelming drama, and Alan Rickman was hilarious as the evil
Sheriff of Nottingham in the Kevin Costner dud ``Robin Hood: Prince
of Thieves.''
	   The flip side of this rule is that sometimes, even when you have
a pair of actors as talented as Kevin Spacey and Samuel L. Jackson,
you get a movie as dull as ``The Negotiator.''
	   From its opening scene with Jackson heroically saving the day
(think ``Blown Away'') to the murky conspiracy involving crooked
cops and a pension fund (think ``The Big Easy'') to the
unbelievably hokey final shot of Jackson's Chicago police badge,
``The Negotiator'' is so familiar that it may as well have been
patched together from other movies.
	   Jackson plays Danny Roman, the department's best hostage
negotiator, a gutsy and unpredictable cop loved by almost everyone
in his precinct. But, of course, there's a catch _ isn't there
always? _ and Roman gets framed for stealing from the officers'
pension fund. His friends in the department suddenly turn on him
(think ``Fallen''), and his lawyer advises him to pack it in and
negotiate a plea bargain.
	   When no one will listen to him, Roman decides to take a top
police official hostage to try and clear his name. Hey, what better
way to demonstrate you're an upstanding, law-abiding officer than
to point a gun at your boss' head?
	   He demands to talk only to Chris Sabian, a respected negotiator
from another precinct, whom he knows only by reputation. Roman's
theory is that somebody he knows probably framed him, so the only
person he can trust is a stranger.
	   What follows is a convoluted mixture that can't decide if it's a
psychological drama or a mystery about the pension fund or a summer
action flick. It ends up borrowing from each theme, and the sum
total is none of the above.
	   All the cliches are in place: the concerned, loving wife (Regina
Taylor, who was much better as the concerned, loving wife of Denzel
Washington in ``Courage Under Fire''); the meddlesome media; the
cold-eyed, bureaucratic FBI agents. The late J.T. Walsh, who built
a career as the utilitarian villain of character actors, plays
another baddie here. Too bad Hollywood never took better advantage
of his talent.
	   Director F. Gary Gray has said Jackson and Spacey were his top
picks for the lead roles, and it's easy to see why. Jackson has a
history of playing wisecracking, emotional characters like the
Bible-quoting Jules of ``Pulp Fiction.'' Spacey was Hollywood's
flavor of the month after winning an Oscar as the cerebral con
artist in ``The Usual Suspects.'' But their characters in
``Negotiator'' are just pale imitations of their earlier successes.
Both need to stop playing cops and criminals and demonstrate what
they can really do.
	   There are a few bright spots. Jackson is at his best when he
questions Walsh at gunpoint about the pension conspiracy. For the
benefit of the other hostages, he points out the visual cues Walsh
gives him that help him determine whether he's getting any closer
to the truth, making Walsh even more nervous.
	   Also amusing is the scene where we meet Spacey, who is
negotiating a truce between his angry wife and his defiant teen-age
daughter.
	   But these are just tiny glimpses into the lives of these
characters. If the filmmakers want anyone to care about them, they
need to show us more. We find out that Roman is newly married, but
we never get more than a passing sense of the depth of feeling he
has for his wife. We are told Sabian is a brilliant negotiator who
has gone five years without a casualty, but we never get more than
a few seconds of his hostage-soothing patter before it's abruptly
cut off by yet another pointless action sequence.
	   Gray makes a halfhearted attempt at a
you-should-have-seen-it-coming ending, but he wimps out at the last
minute and the cliche-riddled lines fall clumsily back into place.
Sadly, this is no ``Usual Suspects'' and Spacey isn't playing
Verbal this time.
	   ``The Negotiator,'' a Warner Bros. release, was produced by
David Hoberman and Arnon Milchan and written by James DeMonaco and
Kevin Fox. Running time: 2 hours, 15 minutes.

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Like a cool breeze in an overheated summer
movie season, ``Ever After'' is a refreshing surprise for jaded
audiences who gave up on finding a true feel-good movie with
artistic merit and appeal for all ages.
	   No violence? No sex? No corruption or natural disasters? Pinch
yourself; it's not a fairy tale.
	   Or rather, it is a fairy tale. But don't be misled. This is the
Cinderella story as you've never seen it before. Gorgeous to look
at and carefully conceived, it is the feminist Cinderella, a
retelling of a timeless tale with cheeky modern upgrades.
	   Just consider the fact that Cinderella's glass slippers are
designed by Ferragamo and the fairy godmother is none other than
Leonardo da Vinci and you know you're not in Kansas anymore (Oops,
wrong fairy tale).
	   In this enchanting saga, it is the 16th century in the lush
French countryside. The sight of rolling green hills and the sounds
of George Fenton's soaring music tells us we are entering a
romantic world far from our own _ or maybe not so far, it turns
out.
	   Our heroine, Danielle, is introduced as a child but quickly
emerges in young womanhood as Drew Barrymore, a feisty, literate
and strong-minded orphan whose spirit has survived the rigors of
servitude to her wicked stepmother.
	   The screenplay by director Andy Tennant, Susannah Grant and Rick
Parks takes some liberties with the original Cinderella legend, but
there's enough left to satisfy purists.
	   Anjelica Huston is the wicked stepmother, and her take on the
role is nothing short of dazzling. This is a human stepmother, a
beautiful woman in glamorous costumes whose marriage was aborted by
her husband's untimely death. His daughter, the symbol of her loss,
is the target of her resentment, and we see in her not just the
villain of the Grimm fairy tale but, occasionally, the
grief-stricken widow beneath.
	   Even the wicked stepsisters aren't quite as bad as we remember.
No longer ugly, one of them, Marguerite (Megan Dodds), is pretty
but nasty and the other, Jacqueline (Melanie Lansky), is plump and
sympathetic.
	   Yes, there is a prince, and a very handsome one. But his name is
not Charming; it's Henry. And, as depicted by Welsh actor Dougray
Scott, he's a man as angst-stricken as Hamlet. His parents want to
marry him off to a Spanish princess he has never met while he's out
pursuing a young woman of questionable lineage _ our own Danielle.
	   Although she's cute, it's obviously her spirit and smart mouth
that captivate him. The fact that she shares his interest in
reading and libraries strains credulity a bit. But, hey, this is a
fairy tale.
	   There are lots of adventures with gypsies and villains. Danielle
saves Henry from peril and, in a defining moment of this script, he
tries to save her only to find she's just fine without him.
	   ``YOU were going to rescue ME?'' she asks incredulously.
	   When the king plans a masked ball for Henry to choose a bride,
the stepmother swings into action, trying to market Marguerite as
the bride. Meanwhile, da Vinci (Patrick Godfrey), who is the royal
family's house guest, swings into action to prepare Danielle for
the ball. (You may laugh; but it works). His dream of flight
translates into a costume by designer Jenny Beavan that is a show
stopper.
	   The production, designed by Michael Howells and photographed by
Andrew Dunn, is lavish and the costumes exceptional. Producers
Mireille Soria and Tracey Trench joined Tennant in what is clearly
a labor of love.
	   Although the Twentieth Century Fox release is rated PG-13, this
movie will delight adults as well as children.
	   ``This Cinderella is not a victim,'' Tennant has said of his
film, and that's an important message for all ages.

	   ``Armageddon: The Album'' (Columbia) _ Various
	   Not having seen the movie ``Armageddon,'' we'll take a wild
guess that it's one of those big, loud, empty summer flicks that
you forget a few hours after seeing it. How can we be so sure?
Because that's exactly what the soundtrack is like.
	   It has no fewer than four Aerosmith songs. ``I Don't Want to
Miss a Thing'' is an empty Diane Warren composition, all competence
and no heart. There's one new outtake, an overplayed classic
(``Sweet Emotion'') and a Beatles cover you've heard before (``Come
Together'').
	   Journey's ``Remember Me'' introduces a new lead singer, Steve
Augeri, so stunningly similar to the departed Steve Perry that even
their mothers would have trouble telling them apart. From the sound
of Chantal Kreviazuk's self-conscious take on ``Leaving on a Jet
Plane,'' Columbia would have done much better to include something
for her fine, overlooked debut.
	   About the only thing worthwhile is another cover _ Shawn
Colvin's interpretation of World Party's ``When the Rainbow
Comes,'' is an indication she's still on a roll.
	   This has become the summer of soundtracks, with listeners shying
away from many single-artist releases in favor of the variety
available on compilations. That said, there are far better choices
than ``Armageddon.''
	   _ By David Bauder, Associated Press Writer.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``Dr. Dolittle'' (Atlantic) _ Various
	   ``Dr. Dolittle'' is one of those increasingly rare soundtracks
that delivers one great groove after another without the inevitable
clunkers to weigh it down.
	   Much of the credit for accomplishing this goes to Timbaland,
rhythm and blues producer-of-the-moment, whose imprint is all over
this album, including Aaliyah's smoldering track, ``Are You That
Somebody?'' He also keeps things jamming with his own rap, ``Da
Funk.''
	   But the soundtrack does well even without Timbaland's stamp of
approval. Montell Jordan's freaky ``Let's Ride'' gets even steamier
_ if that's possible _ with Shaunta adding her racy rap; and singer
Robin S. joins Mary for the uplifting _ and funky _ gospel song
``Dance.''
	   _ By Nekesa Mumbi Moody, Associated Press Writer
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``Into the Sun'' (Grand Royal / Capitol) _ Sean Lennon
	   ``Vertical Man'' (Mercury) _ Ringo Starr
	   Sean Lennon, perhaps John and Yoko's greatest collaboration,
gets warmed up on his debut album, ``Into the Sun,'' with a
predilection for the progressive as well as some easy tunes for a
summer's eve.
	   Lennon previously played in his mother's Bq|N``Yellow Submarine,'' as
Lennon sings, ``The sky is like an ocean ...''
	   Sean Lennon displays a mix of aesthetics, including his mother's
avant-garde sensibilities and his father's knack for vocal harmony
and melody.
	   Meanwhile, Ringo Starr touches down from orbit with his best
batch of songs since ``Blast From Your Past,'' all with a little
help from his friends.
	   George Harrison plays slide guitar on the melancholy ``King of
Broken Hearts,'' in which Starr sings somberly, ``Some people live
but never learn/ I can make a brand new start/ living in the land
of broken hearts.''
	   Starr turns the early Beatles single, ``Love Me Do,'' into a
midnight rambler with backing vocalist Steven Tyler on harmonica,
resulting in a staccato Aerosmith-like ending.
	   Three musical generations come together on the Dobie Gray gem,
``Drift Away,'' as Tom Petty and Alanis Morrisette each sing a
verse before joining Ringo for the liberating chorus of ``Give me
the beat boys; free my soul/ I wanna get lost in your rock 'n'
roll/ And drift away ...''
	   ``I Was Walkin''' is a medium-tempo boogie with Sir Paul
McCartney, Tyler and Morrisette. McCartney, Tyler, Stone Temple
Pilot's Scott Weiland and guitarist Joe Walsh get Ringo going in
the lighthearted ``La De Da.''
	   The album's title track with Ozzy Osbourne's heaving contains a
notable squiggly guitar solo, as does ``Without Understanding''
with Brian Wilson.
	   ``Vertical Man'' can't be stopped!

US: SHEPARD - Some of the original astronauts have paid tribute to
Alan Shepard - one of America's true adventurers. At a memorial
service in Houston, they described their fellow spaceman as a
patriot, who helped restore the country's self-esteem at a time it
was losing the space race to the Soviets. APTV's wrap of the event
includes comments from John Glenn and file of Shepard. (FIRST RUN

KOSOVO: AID - APTV has coverage of the U-N-H-C-R delivering grain,
water and food parcels to Albanian families hiding out in forests or
with farmers around Malisevo. The UN organisation has warned that
thousands face disaster unless a political solution to the crisis in
Kosovo is found soon. (FIRST RUN 1700 F-L-A-S-H)
----
RUSSIA: IMF - A senior International Monetary Fund official believes
Russia is on its way to economic recovery but warns more needs to be
done before further international loans are granted. APTV has
coverage of Stanley Fischer - the I-M-F's deputy managing director -
wrapping up his meetings in Moscow with Deputy Prime Minister
Anatoly Chubais and other government officials. (FIRST RUN 1700
F-L-A-S-H)
----
NIRELAND: BLAST - A number of people needed treatment for shock
after a car bomb exploded in the mostly Protestant town of
Banbridge. The blast damaged several buildings, but there were no
reports of serious injuries. APTV has aftermath coverage and
comments from local politicians and police. (FIRST RUN LATIN AMERICA
1900)
----
FRANCE: CYCLING - The penultimate stage of the Tour de France got
off to a damp start on Saturday. It was not just the weather that
was depressing the riders, but also the dismal record of
drugs-related scandal that has dogged this year's race. The package
includes highlights of the day's events, comments from one of the
teams taking part in the Tour and voxpops. (FIRST RUN LATIN AMERICA
1900)
----
COLOMBIA: ATTACK - APTV has aftermath coverage of an attack by
Colombia's second most powerful guerrilla group on the town of

have witnessed Fidel Castro in a coma has told reporters that she is
not a doctor. The comments by Felix Ochoa Cabrera seem to support
Castro's denial that he underwent treatment for a serious brain
disease. (FIRST RUN LATIN AMERICA 1900)
----
COLOMBIA: POETS - A new initiative by the Institute of Culture aims
to provide relief for the stresses and strains of daily life in the
capital, Bogota, through the most elusive of art forms - poetry.
APTV has a feature on the so-called ``bus poets'' - local poets who
are being encouraged to read their works on buses. (FIRST RUN LATIN

American women swimmers win team gold

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes, Maurer gold in 100 backstroke; WILL BE
UPDATED with later events. &QL; 
 &UR; By BILL BARNARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ The money will come in handy for the
four U.S. women swimmers who won it. The team gold was worth its
weight in memories for the others Saturday night.
	   The American team, led by Cristina Teuscher and Jenny Thompson,
won the team gold after defeating Germany 78-44, its third straight
dual-meet win at the Goodwill Games.
	   ``I didn't have any concrete goals, just to swim good times,''
Thompson said. ``But I'm real happy that the team was undefeated.
The dual-meet format made things more exciting.''
	   The gold medal is worth dlrs 50,000 to the winning team, and
since only four of the 18 team members are out of college, those
four get to share the loot.
	   Thompson of Dover, New Hampshire; captain Lea Maurer of
Crestwood, New York; Richelle Fox of Scotia, New York; and Ashley
Tappin of New Orleans will take home dlrs 12,500 each for the team
gold medal.
	   ``I just bought a '96 Tahoe that I have dlrs 15,000 left to pay
on it, and this money will got straight to that,'' Tappin said.
``As long as I have been swimming, it has never been money
oriented. So for me to come away with all this money is
unbelievable. I just thank my lucky stars.''
	   With an additional dlrs 1,000 going to the best time in each
event during the three dual meets, Thompson had a chance _ pending
the World Team-China meet later Saturday _ to win a total of dlrs
14,500 and four gold medals.
	   Teuscher, of New Rochelle, New York, ineligible for prize money
because she still attends Columbia, won the 200 freestyle and the
200 individual medley against Germany. She had a chance for five
gold medals: the team gold, the 800 and 400 freestyles, the 200 IM
and the freestyle relay.
	   ``It was a fairy tale week _ an emotional roller-coaster,
intense and exciting,'' Teuscher said. ``I think this will make me
stronger and more confident. I wanted to prove it to myself more
than anybody else.''
	   Thompson won the 100 freestyle and swam a leg of the winning 400
medley relay against Germany.
	   Saturday night's U.S. freestyle relay team was disqualified for
an early start, but Teuscher and Thompson still had the fastest
pending relay time earlier in the week.
	   Even with the disqualification, the United States won 10 of the
14 events against the Germans, including the first six to give it a
38-14 lead.
	   Thompson had the best time of the week in the 100 butterfly and
two relays. She would have to split the dlrs 2,000 in relay money
with Tappin and Fox.
	   Thompson also had the best time going into the final World
Team-China matchup, but Martina Moravcova of Slovakia topped
Thompson with a time of 55.46 seconds, .10 better than Thompson,
who won the silver.
	   Maurer, with the best time in the 100 backstroke, won an
additional dlrs 1,000, while Fox and Tappin could win another dlrs
500 for their relay shares.
	   Figure skating finished, and the ice dance gold medal went to
Russia's world champion team of Anjelika Krylova and Oleg
Ovsiannikov.
	   A large crowd at Nassau Coliseum _ including former President
Jimmy Carter _ cheered Krylova and Ovsiannikov through their
energetic free dance, which earned two perfect scores.
	   The silver medal went to another Russian couple, Irina Lobacheva
and Ilia Averbukh, with Elena Grushina and Rusian Goncharov of
Ukraine taking the bronze.
	   The dream matchup in women's beach volleyball fell one match
short.
	   Holly McPeak and Lisa Arce, the No. 2 team, were upset by
Australia's Kerri Pottharst and Pauline Manser, 12-11, 11-12, 12-6,
in the semifinals.
	   That deprived the games of a final-day gold-medal meeting
between the top two teams. The No. 1 duo, Brazil's Shelda Bede and
Adriana Behar, made it with a 12-5, 12-7 victory over Laura
Bruschini and Annamaria Solazzi of Italy.
	   McPeak and Arce have won three international tournaments and
finished second in last year's world championship. After
squandering two set points in the opener, they put together an
impressive rally from 10-3 down to win the second set, but never
were really in the decisive set, which was played under rally rules
_ a point on every serve.
	   The U.S. team led 3-2 in the third set, but the Australians took
the lead for good with the next three points, then closed out the
match by scoring the last five points.
	   This was the first match of either the men's or women's
competition to go to the deciding set.

Games gold medal to her two world and U.S. titles.
	   The Olympic silver medalist easily beat the field, bouncing back
from a rare fall to get solid 5.9s for presentation before a
near-capacity crowd that included former President Jimmy Carter.

South African sets world record, but doesn't get the money

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ World record yes, payoff no, and
Penny Heyns is mad.
	   Heyns, of South Africa, set a world record in the 50-meter
breaststroke Saturday night. But because it is not an official
event, she will not earn the dlrs 50,000 offered to anyone setting
a world record at the Goodwill Games.
	   Heyns was timed in 30.95 seconds on the first lap of the 100
breaststroke event. She earned the Goodwill gold medal with a time
of 1 minute, 8.14 seconds.
	   FINA, the world governing body for swimming, decided this year
to credit swimmers with world records for the first 50 meters of
100-meter events in breaststroke, backstroke and butterfly.
Fifty-meter races are only contested in freestyle.
	   Because the 50 breaststroke is not an event in itself, Heyns
will not earn the dlrs 50,000, a ruling that Heyns disputed after
the race, saying, ``there was no fine print.''
	   The previous 50 record was 31.58 by Silke Hoerner of Germany.

Forecasters say Alex is barely a tropical storm
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS with Alex's location at 0300 GMT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ A reconnaissance plane sent out to have a look at
Tropical Storm Alex found sustained winds near 50 mph (80 kph),
forecasters at the National Hurricane Center said.
	   At 0300 GMT Sunday, the storm was about 360 miles (580
kilometers) east of the Leeward Islands, moving west-northwest at
about 15 mph (24 kph). It was near 19 degrees 1 minute north
latitude and 57 degrees 6 minutes west longitude.
	   Meanwhile, Hurricane Estelle gained strength far off the Mexican
Pacific coast on Saturday, posing little risk to land but bringing
light rain to western Mexico.
	   The U.S. Hurricane Center in Miami said Saturday that Estelle
was located about 610 miles (980 kilometers) southwest of the tip
of the Baja California Peninsula and moving west at 15 mph (24
kph). The storm was churning maximum sustained winds of 115 mph
(185 kph), the center said.
	   Estelle was expected to continue gaining strength over the next
day or so, until it moves over cooler waters, the center said.
	   If Alex follows its course, it will be passing north of the
Leeward Islands on Sunday, with most of the showers and gusty winds
over the open Atlantic Ocean.
	   A ship in the area reported gusts of near hurricane force about
150 miles (240 kilometers) north of the storm's center.
	   Little change was expected in Alex's strength. Meanwhile, a
large tropical wave in the central tropical Atlantic Ocean was
moving westward at 15 mph (24 kph).
	   Slow development of the system was possible during the next day
or two, forecasters said.

Relief for shy Thai condom shoppers is on the way
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thais shy about buying condoms across
the counter will find relief next year when a British company
introduces the country's first condom-vending machines, a newspaper
said Sunday.
	   London Royal Consumer Products Ltd. plans to launch the machines
in Thailand before entering other Southeast Asian markets,
according to the English-language The Nation.
	   The company already dominates 70 percent of country's condom
market with its Kingtex and Durex brands and says per capita use of
condoms is still low compared to several Asian nations.
	   The company also plans to introduce sales outlets on the
Internet, the newspaper said.
	   The newspaper quoted the company's commercial director Jon Gray
as saying his firm would promote use of condoms among the general
public. Thailand has a massive sex industry and a high incidence of
the deadly AIDS disease.
	   Despite the economic crisis in Southeast Asia, Gray said condom
sales were performing better than many other consumer products.

New Japanese Cabinet fares poorly in newspaper opinion poll
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Barely one-third of Japanese interviewed said they
approve of their country's new Cabinet, making it one of the most
unpopular new governments in decades, according to an opinion poll
released Sunday.
	   The poll, conducted by the Yomiuri newspaper, also showed
Japan's leading opposition party in a dead heat for voter support
with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party of incoming Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi.
	   The survey found that 33.1 percent of voters approve of the
Cabinet that Obuchi unveiled Thursday after he won an election in
Parliament to become Japan's next leader.
	   That result makes it the third-lowest approval rating for any
new Cabinet since such surveys began in the early 1970s, Japan's
largest newspaper said.
	   The newspaper said it quizzed about 1,000 voters nationwide on
Friday and Saturday. It provided no margin of error.
	   Of those polled, 52 percent said they disapproved of the new
Cabinet, which Obuchi has vowed will focus on rejuvenating an
economy stuck in its worst recession since World War II and
strengthening the nation's debt-ridden banking system.
	   The poll also showed that 21.4 percent of voters said they
support the Democratic Party of charismatic opposition leader Naoto
Kan, while 24.1 back Obuchi's ruling LDP.
	   The newspaper said only the brief-lived government of Sosuke Uno
in 1989 and the Cabinet of Takeo Fukuda in 1977 had lower approval
ratings when they took office.

Death toll from floods rises to 25; at least 70 still missing

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The death toll from flash floods rose
to 25 on Sunday as rescuers resumed searching rugged mountain
valleys where hundreds of sleeping campers were swept away by
swollen streams.
	   But heavy rains and raging currents hampered the search for 70
people missing in the Chiri Mountains, a popular hiking and camping
site 220 kilometers (135 miles) south of Seoul, disaster relief
headquarters said.
	   Rescue officer Lee Jong-kun, 46, died in a hospital and another
rescuer remained in critical condition after jumping into the water
to save a man trapped in a car swept in flood water.
	   The bodies of two small children were pulled up early Sunday by
police and soldiers searching downstream with flood lights.
	   Disaster officials feared the casualty figures could rise as
families reported more missing people.
	   ``Because the streams are so rapid and studded with razor-sharp
rocks, we believe nearly all those missing are dead,'' said a
disaster official, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Family members gathered at makeshift relief centers in mountain
valleys awaiting word on their missing relatives. The hopes of many
seemed to fall as torrential rains poured down again Sunday morning
in the thickly wooded mountains.
	   ``The flood overwhelmed our tent in the twinkling of an eye. I
held on to a tree branch. But my two boys, I could not find them.
What should I do? How can I find them?'' a father, identified only
by his surname Kim, told MBC-TV in a quavering voice.
	   A rain front moving east from China dumped up to 30 centimeters
(12 inches) of rain early Saturday in southern Korea. Lighter rain
continued in the region throughout Saturday and into Sunday.
	   The hardest hit was the Chiri mountains, where a record 14
centimeters (5.6 inches) of rain poured down in less than one hour.
Campers compared the experience to ``the heaven dumping rain with
buckets.''
	   Weather forecasters had failed to predict the heavy rain, and
the sudden rise in the gushing streams caught unawares hundreds of
vacationers camping along the scenic gorges.
	   ``The weather forecasters said the monsoon was over and we went
on vacation. Only if they warned us of the rain one hour earlier,''
Choi Jong-il, 39, told the national news agency Yonhap. He lost his
wife and two children to the floods.
	   Hundreds remained stranded. Rescuers used helicopters and ropes
to guide the marooned campers across raging streams to safety.
	   The downpours also submerged homes and farmland, washed away
roads and triggered landslides. Disaster officials estimated
tentative property damage dlrs 12 million.
	   TV footage showed large stretches of rice fields underwater and
crumpled cars swept away in flood water.
	   Police said a number of people were killed in nearby villages.
	   A family of four were crushed to death when their home collapsed
under a landslide Saturday.
	   Also Sunday, a dead North Korean civilian was found floating off
the South Korean east coast. The military suspected the man was
drowned and floated to the south.
	   After working overnight to clear a landslide that covered a
large section of rail, authorities restored normal train service in
the southwestern Cholla province early Sunday.
	   Two airports closed Saturday because of the rains resumed
operations. But coastal ferry routes halted operations because of
storm and high-wave warnings, stranding thousands of summer
vacationers.

Buccaneers 30, Steelers 6
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KEN BERGER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANTON, Ohio (AP) _ No, it's not time to panic, Pittsburgh. That
doesn't mean Bill Cowher is happy.
	   Showing a lethal, efficient offense even with backups playing
most of the game, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers dominated the Steelers
30-6 on Saturday night in the Hall of Fame exhibition game.
	   It was far from a true test of how much the Steelers miss Greg
Lloyd, because the starters barely played. But these numbers put
Cowher in a foul mood, preseason game or not. The Bucs ripped the
Steelers defense for 342 yards, 198 on the ground.
	   ``I am never going to say that this is easy to take,'' Cowher
said. ``I will never tolerate something like this on a regular
basis. It's easy to say it's just an exhibition game, but every
time you step out on the field you have a degree of pride.
	   Leeland McElroy led the Bucs with 72 yards on nine carries,
including a 25-yard TD run. Steve Walsh and Scott Milanovich staged
a pretty even battle for the backup quarterback job. Rookie Jacquez
Green led a deep, speedy contingent of receivers with a 53-yard TD
reception from Milanovich.
	   ``We're making progress,'' Bucs coach Tony Dungy said. ``We
played these guys up in Pittsburgh a couple of years ago and really
couldn't compete with them. It's the first game, so don't read too
much into it.''
	   Jahine Arnold was the bright spot for Pittsburgh with 112
kickoff return yards. Third-string quarterback Pete Gonzalez was
9-for-15 for 102 yards.
	   Trent Dilfer played two series and was 1-for-4. Bucs
quarterbacks were 14-for-28 for 144 yards _ and free agent
acquisition Bert Emanuel didn't even catch a pass.
	   ``Yeah, it was a rough one,'' said Pittsburgh quarterback
Kordell Stewart, who played three series, completing a 9-yard pass
and running for 7 yards. ``But you know it's just the first
preseason game. You can't expect too much.''
	   A sellout crowd of 23,875 was on hand for the first Hall of Fame
game televised in prime time. It followed the induction of Paul
Krause, Tommy McDonald, Anthony Munoz, Mike Singletary and Dwight
Stephenson to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
	   McElroy, claimed on waivers by the Bucs, showed that he might be
the big-play running back Dungy is looking for to back up Dunn.
	   ``I know I'm being scrutinized and I'm trying to show them they
didn't make a mistake getting me,'' McElroy said.
	   John Husted kicked two field goals in the first quarter to make
it 6-0, and the night was over for starters on both teams.
	   Walsh, the Bucs' backup last year, completed 8-of-14 for 62
yards, including a 24-yard strike to Brice Hunter in the second
quarter. That set up Husted's third field goal and made it 16-3.
	   Milanovich orchestrated two touchdown drives in the third that
made it a full-fledged blowout. He had a 5-yard TD pass to John
Davis on a drive set up by McElroy's 24-yard scamper on a draw
play. Husted's kick made it 23-3.
	   Pittsburgh's chance to stop the onslaught was thwarted when
Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala fumbled at the Steelers' 4.
	   Milanovich then led the Bucs on a 96-yard scoring drive, hitting
Green with a 53-yard pass to set up Steve Lee's 5-yard TD catch.
Husted's extra point made it 30-3 and gave him a Hall of Fame
record 12 points. Kansas City's Jan Stenerud had 11 in 1972.
	   ``I had to get myself into the Hall of Fame some way,'' Husted
said. ``I guess if they can put like a little small plaque in the
back room, that'd be OK.''
	   Steelers punter Josh Miller was helped off the field with a
sprained ankle after recovering a bad snap by Roger Duffy in the
first quarter.
	   Pittsburgh receiver Harold Bishop was hit by rookie Shevin Smith
as he went for a pass by Pete Gonzalez late in the third. Bishop
got up, but was wobbly as he walked off the field.
	   The packed house at Fawcett Stadium _ a high school field _ was
a mere prelude to next year, when the expansion Cleveland Browns
play their first game in Ohio against the Dallas Cowboys.

PITTSBURGH: 45 homers.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Expos 4, Padres 2 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   In Montreal, Vladimir Guerrero went 2-for-4 and drove in three
runs to lead Montreal over San Diego.
	   Guerrero hit a two-run single in the first off Mark Langston
(4-4) and added an RBI double in the third to increase his
team-leading RBI total to 75 as Montreal won for only the fourth
time in 16 games.
	   Shane Bennett (4-4) allowed one run in 2 2-3 innings of hitless
relief, and Ugueth Urbina pitched the ninth for his 24th save.
 &UR; Giants 8, Phillies 7, 10 innings
	   In Philadelphia, Bill Mueller hit a sacrifice fly in the 10th
inning to give San Francisco a victory over Philadelphia.
	   Robb Nen (7-2) earned the victory despite giving up a
game-tying, two-run homer to pinch-hitter Kevin Jordan in the
eighth inning.
	   The Phillies loaded the bases with one out in the bottom of the
10th, but Rich Rodriguez got his second save by getting Kevin
Sefcik to ground into a double play.
	   Brent Mayne started the Giants' winning rally with a one-out
single and was replaced by pinch-runner Shawon Dunston. Ricky
Botallico (1-2) then gave up back-to-back walks to Charlie Hayes
and Marvin Bernard to load the bases loaded before Mueller
delivered his second game-winning RBI of the series with a long fly
to center.
 &UR; Mets 2, Dodgers 1
	   In New York, pinch-hitter Matt Franco homered with one out in
the ninth inning and Edgardo Alfonzo doubled home the winning run
with two outs as the New York Mets rallied past the Los Angeles
Dodgers.
	   Carlos Perez, acquired with shortstop Mark Grudzielanek on
Friday night in a trade with Montreal, pitched seven scoreless
innings in his Dodgers debut, allowing just two hits.
	   But Jeff Shaw, who had been 8-for-8 in save chances since the
Dodgers got him from Cincinnati last month, could not hold a 1-0
lead.
 &UR; Reds 9, Marlins 7, 10 innings
	   In Miami, Eddie Taubensee's two-run double in the 10th inning
gave the Cincinnati Reds a victory over the Florida Marlins.
	   John Hudek (3-5) picked up the win with 1 1-3 innings in relief,
while Matt Mantei (3-2) lost his second game in as many nights.
	   Barry Larkin led off the 10th against Mantei with his third
single of the game and stole second. After Sean Casey struck out,
Dmitri Young was intentionally walked. Taubensee followed with a
blast off the left-center field wall to score the winning runs.
	   It was Florida's 13th loss in 15 games, while the Reds won for
just the fourth time in 16 games.
 &UR; Diamondbacks 5, Brewers 4
	   In Milwaukee, two defensive lapses by Milwaukee catcher Bobby
Hughes allowed Arizona to score two runs in the eighth inning.
	   Andy Fox singled and then scored the tying run on Danny
Klassen's bunt single when Hughes failed to cover home.
	   After Chad Fox (0-2) walked Jay Bell, Eric Plunk relieved.
Klassen, who had reached second on a wild pitch by Fox, moved to
third on Devon White's sacrifice and then scored on Hughes' passed
ball.
	   Willie Banks (1-1) picked up the win with three innings of
scoreless relief.
	   Milwaukee rookie reliever Bronswell Patrick snapped a 3-3 tie
with a leadoff homer in the fifth off Felix Rodriguez. It was
Patrick's first career homer and the first by a Brewers' pitcher
since Skip Lockwood hit one in 1971.
