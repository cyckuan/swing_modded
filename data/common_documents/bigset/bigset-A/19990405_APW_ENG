<HEADLINE> Suspect in Gay Attack Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- One of two men charged in the killing of  
gay college student Matthew Shepard pleaded guilty Monday to 
murder, admitting he tied the bleeding young man to a wooden fence 
and left him for dead on the prairie. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell Henderson, a 21-year-old high school dropout and roofer,  
avoided a trial and a possible death sentence with his plea. 
</P>
<P>
	He was sentenced to two consecutive life terms and will not be  
eligible for parole. His only hope for release is a pardon. 
</P>
<P>
	Judy Shepard cried at the courtroom podium while talking about  
her son, then turned to Henderson: ``I hope you never experience 
another day or night without experiencing the terror, humiliation, 
the hopelessness and helplessness that my son felt that night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Henderson and Aaron McKinney, 21, posed as  
homosexuals and lured the 5-foot-2, 105-pound Shepard out of a bar 
last October, kidnapped and pistol-whipped him and left him tied to 
a fence in the cold. The 21-year-old University of Wyoming student 
died five days later at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The crime led to demands for stronger hate-crime laws around the  
country. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he pleaded guilty to felony murder and kidnapping,  
Henderson said his friend and co-defendant delivered the fatal 
blows. 
</P>
<P>
	He matter-of-factly recounted the grisly beating and his  
attempts to cover up his role, then asked forgiveness from his and 
Shepard's families. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is not a moment that goes by that I don't see what  
happened that night,'' he said. ``I hope one day you will be able 
to find it in your heart to forgive me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson said he tried to stop the beating, but McKinney struck  
him with a gun when he spoke up. ``Matthew looked really bad, so I 
told (McKinney) to stop, he's had enough,'' Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Jeffrey Donnell told Henderson he did not believe he was  
remorseful. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pain you have caused here, Mr. Henderson, will never go  
away. Never,'' Donnell said. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney will be tried in August on first-degree murder,  
kidnapping and aggravated robbery charges. He could be sentenced to 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	There had been speculation that if Henderson pleaded guilty, he  
would end up testifying against his friend and co-defendant, but 
officials would not confirm that will happen. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Cal Rerucha said he believed it was appropriate to  
offer a plea agreement to Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is my hope that Mr. Henderson will die in the Wyoming state  
penitentiary and the only time he leaves the Wyoming state 
pententiary is when they bury him,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Wyatt Skaggs denied that Shepard was targeted  
because he was gay. ``This crime has never been a hate crime,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chasity Pasley, Henderson's girlfriend, pleaded guilty in  
December to accessory after the fact, admitting she helped hide 
Henderson's clothing, which was covered with Shepard's blood. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney's girlfriend, Kristen Price, is scheduled to stand  
trial in May on an accessory charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the courthouse Monday, a dozen young people dressed as  
angels, with white sheets for wings, tried to block from view an 
anti-gay group that was demonstrating. 
</P>
<P>
	The angels stood silently, but inside their human wall about a  
dozen anti-gay demonstrators from Kansas shouted slogans and waved 
signs, including one that said ``God Hates Fags.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``These ... creatures are sending this nation to hell in a  
handbasket,'' said the Rev. Fred Phelps of Westboro Baptist Church. 
Phelps and members of his church picketed Shepard's funeral in 
Casper with anti-gay signs.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends At Record 10,007.33 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology issues propelled the stock market  
sharply higher Monday, lifting the Dow Jones industrial average 
back above 10,000, as investors stopped worrying about interest 
rates and looked forward to strong first-quarter earnings reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue chip index rose 174.82 at 10,007.33, just squeezing  
past the Dow's previous closing high of 10,006.78, set March 29. 
Monday's session was just the second time that the Dow has finished 
above 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite index and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index  
also set new records. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq rose 66.69 to 2,560.06, passing its previous high  
close of 2,510.09, reached Feb. 1. The S&AMP;P 500 rose 27.40 to 
1,321.12, breaking its record of 1,316.55 set March 18. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a herd instinct out there, as everyone wants to buy the  
winners,'' said David Orr, chief economist at First Union Capital 
Markets in Charlotte, N.C. ``This is not economics; it's 
psychological.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Traders were buoyed by Friday's Labor Department report that  
just 46,000 new jobs were created in February, the smallest 
increase in three years. The report calmed investor fears that the 
economy was growing too fast and that the Federal Reserve might 
raise interest rates to slow it down. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts said the rally exceeded their expectations from the  
jobs report. Monday was the first chance the market, which was 
closed for Good Friday, had to react to the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing wrong with the economy, but is the economy  
that good? The answer is probably no,'' Orr said. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks once again set the tone for trading.  
</P>
<P>
	Among Dow stocks, IBM was up 6 5/8 to 183 5/8 and Hewlett-Packard rose  
3 9/16 to 71 7/16. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Nasdaq, Yahoo! shot up 39 3/16 to 219 1/8 as traders  
anticipated a strong earnings report from the Internet company on 
Wednesday. GeoCities and Broadcast.com, two companies Yahoo! is 
buying also rose more than 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer maker Dell was up 2 7/8 at 44 1/16, Sun Microsystems  
gained 3 13/16 at 130, and Microsoft was up 2 1/4 at 94 15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online rose 16 15/16 to 166 15/16 on the New York Stock  
Exchange. The online services giant declined to comment Monday on a 
published report that revived rumors that AOL was in talks to buy 
CBS. The takeover talk was the subject of a report Monday in the 
online edition of the San Jose Mercury News. 
</P>
<P>
	Online stock trading companies also traded higher after a Credit  
Suisse First Boston analyst issued positive comments about the 
sector. E-Trade Group rose 11 3/4 to 72 5/8 Charles Schwab rose 9 1/8 to 
103 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue chip stocks also rose amid optimism about first-quarter  
earnings reports that will be released starting this week. That 
included oil companies -- Exxon was up 2 1/16 to 72 3/16 and Chevron 
rose 3 13/16 to 90 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	``Expectations are very solid for the larger companies,'' said  
Richard Cripps, chief market strategist for Legg Mason of 
Baltimore. ``Microsoft, GE and these types of companies will show 
robust double-digit growth in sales and earnings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Online bookseller Amazon.com rose 15 1/2 to 186 1/2 and retailer  
Wal-Mart gained 2 1/8 to 95 3/8. The two companies settled a suit brought 
by Wal-Mart charging that Amazon hired computer system managers 
away from Wal-Mart to steal the retailer's trade secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin on the  
NYSE with 1,689 up, 1,321 down and 558 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 863.84 million shares vs. 872.44 million in  
the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 9.64 to 614.63, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 9.94 to 721.24 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 3.55 to 402.29.

<HEADLINE> Aerospace Engineer Denney Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALM SPRINGS, Calif. (AP) -- Aerospace engineer Corwin Dwight  
Denney, an entrepreneur and philanthropist who began by personally 
flight-testing his own products, has died. He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
	Denney died of pneumonia April 1 at his home here, following a  
yearlong bout with cancer, according to a statement from the 
University of Southern California, where he served on the Board of 
Trustees. 
</P>
<P>
	The lifelong pilot began manufacturing aerospace components and  
flight-test equipment in 1947 when he founded American Helicopter 
Co., forming the core of what would become his Fortune 500 company, 
Automation Industries Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Denney served as the lone test pilot for the Van Nuys-based  
company, before several veterans joined the business at the end of 
World War II and it became known as Mid-Continent Manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
	The company was soon commissioned by the federal government to  
create complex aircraft structures and nondestructive test 
materials. That funding enabled Denney to merge the business with 
tiny Pasadena-based Automation Instruments in 1952 to form 
Automation Industries. 
</P>
<P>
	While still at the helm of that company, he branched off into  
oil drilling in 1962, forming the independent San Antonio-based 
Venus Oil Co. In later years he also invested in the Beverly 
Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills, helping to restore it to 
profitability before selling his share in 1985 for $33 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But he is perhaps best known for orchestrating a score of  
mergers during his three decades as president, chairman of the 
board and chief executive officer of Automation Industries Inc., 
which he sold to General Cable in 1978 for $106 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in the small town of Washington Court House, Ohio, Denney  
earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the University of 
Michigan in 1943. During the next four years, he developed aircraft 
and jet engine projects in the Army Air Corps. 
</P>
<P>
	Denney also served as a trustee and benefactor for several  
colleges, museums and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his wife, three daughters, two sons, and three  
stepchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral services will be private.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A new governor took office Monday in Quintana  
Roo state, while the official he replaced remained missing amid an 
intensifying investigation into his alleged ties to drug 
traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Villanueva, whose six-year term expired Monday, has  
repeatedly failed to appear for further interrogation after one 
session of questioning by Mexico's anti-drug czar last month. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. authorities have joined Mexican police in the search for  
Villanueva, who has denied any wrongdoing, saying he is being 
targeted by political enemies. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's new governor, Joaquin Hendricks, told the Reforma  
daily that he would order an independent audit of Villanueva's 
administration. 
</P>

	SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) -- A leftist opposition  
congressman hopes to persuade Cuban authorities to spare the lives 
of two Salvadoran men condemned to death for their roles in a 
string of bombings. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruben Zamora, a former guerrilla and two-time presidential  
candidate, said Monday he will travel to Havana this week in hopes 
of speaking with Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina and other 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The two men -- Otto Rene Rodriguez Llerena, 40, and Ernesto Cruz  
Leon, 27 -- were convicted last month on terrorism charges and 
sentenced to death. Under Cuban law, the sentences are 
automatically appealed. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez Llerena was convicted of planting a bomb in a hotel  
and attempting to import explosives to launch other attacks. Cruz 
Leon was found guilty of planting bombs at six tourist locales, 
killing an Italian tourist and wounding 11 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban prosecutors say both men were hired by Cuban exiles to  
bomb tourist sites in order to hurt a prime source of income for 
the island.

<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexican authorities searched Monday for 25  
men who escaped from prisons in two states over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest escape took place Sunday in the Gulf state of  
Tabasco, where 19 felons fled a state prison through an underground 
tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were trying to determine how the tunnel had been dug.  
</P>
<P>
	The escaped men were serving sentences of up to 30 years for  
drug trafficking, kidnapping and homicide. Many were believed to be 
part of the region's most dangerous kidnapping gang. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's breakout was the third in six months at the prison in  
Villahermosa, the state capital, prison director Fredy Chable told 
the government news agency Notimex. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Pacific state of Sinaloa, six convicts escaped from a  
local jail Saturday after giving their prison guards chicken and 
fruit juices laced with sedatives, deputy attorney general Melchor 
Cota said.

<HEADLINE> Jury To Be Seated in Gotti Jr. Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- Nobody got whacked.  
</P>
<P>
	In the entire federal indictment against John A. ``Junior''  
Gotti, there is no mention of murder. No cement shoes, no sleeping 
with the fishes, no kiss on the cheek followed by a bullet to the 
head. There isn't even any leg-breaking. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not that kind of mob case,'' said Ronald Goldstock,  
former director of the state Organized Crime Task Force. ``You 
might not get those much anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So many Mafia leaders are in prison and so many mobsters are  
willing to cooperate that it's difficult now to carry out ``the 
kind of blatant criminal activity people associate with organized 
crime,'' Goldstock said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury selection begins Tuesday in the case against the  
35-year-old Gotti, who is accused of succeeding his father, John J. 
Gotti, to the top of the Gambino crime family after the elder Gotti 
was sent to prison for life in 1992. The younger Gotti could get 15 
years behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Gotti, known as the Teflon Don for avoiding conviction  
in three trials, was finally found guilty in a racketeering case 
that alleged five murders -- including that of his predecessor, Paul 
Castellano -- and featured the Mafia's highest-ranking turncoat, 
Salvatore ``Sammy Bull'' Gravano. 
</P>
<P>
	The case against the younger Gotti consists in large part of  
extortion and loansharking charges that involve only the implied 
threat of violence. 
</P>
<P>
	If the younger Gotti's case is less glamorous, so is the  
defendant himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``Junior,'' whose father was called the Dapper Don for his fine  
suits and silvery hair, has gone to court in sneakers and jeans. 
Unlike his swaggering father, he rushes past the cameras and talks 
to reporters in half-sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Gotti's lawyer Gerald Shargel said that his client  
has apparently been targeted because of his name, which ``has 
become the metaphor for organized crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things we expect this trial to show is that the  
government has for years, since he was in his late teens or early 
20s, targeted him,'' Shargel said. ``The time has come for this 
trial to be held and for him to show that the government's wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Gotti said of his impending trial: ``I'm excited.  
It's like my first day of school. It's like I'm starting 
kindergarten again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gotti is charged with racketeering -- taking part in a criminal  
enterprise known as the Gambino family -- and extortion, robbery, 
labor racketeering, loansharking, gambling and bribery. He also is 
charged with lying about his income on a home refinancing 
application. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is like a kitchen sink approach,'' Shargel said. ``The  
government says, `We're charging him with robbery, and if you don't 
believe robbery, well, he also made a false statement on his 
mortgage application.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The extortion charges allege a virtual mob takeover of the New  
York topless club Scores. 
</P>
<P>
	But Shargel said that Gotti had nothing to do with the club and  
that his money is earned legitimately, with investments in several 
businesses and ``income-producing property that he acquired by 
lawful sources.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The evidence assembled by the government includes thousands of  
taped conversations, some between Gotti and his father at the 
federal prison in Marion, Ill. There are boxes of documents, 
including one that former state Attorney General Dennis Vacco 
called the ``Holy Grail'' -- a list of past and present members of 
New York's five Mafia families. 
</P>
<P>
	That list was found in a search of a Queens basement that also  
turned up $358,000 in cash, which Gotti claims was gift money from 
his wedding; three guns; and a photo of his father. 
</P>
<P>
	Gotti, who originally had 22 co-defendants, has just one left.  
Most of the rest have pleaded guilty, including John ``Jackie 
Nose'' D'Amico, who prosecutors said shared the family leadership 
with ``Junior'' Gotti. The possible witnesses for the government 
include former mobsters Dominic ``Fat Dom'' Borghese, Alphonso 
``Little Al'' D'Arco and William Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
	The proliferation of such traitors has been a key to the decline  
of the mob. 
</P>
<P>
	``People within the mob who want to carry out complex criminal  
activities don't know who they can trust,'' Goldstock said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Barrington Parker has ordered up a jury pool  
of 400. But he turned down a prosecution request that the jurors' 
names be kept secret, saying none of the charges involve the sort 
of violence that warrants an anonymous jury. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not that kind of mob case.

<HEADLINE> 'Junior' Gotti Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- John A. ``Junior'' Gotti, the son and  
alleged successor of America's best-known Mafioso, pleaded guilty 
Monday to racketeering, bribery, extortion and other charges in 
exchange for a prison term of up to seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	The plea was entered the day before jury selection was to begin  
in his federal trial. If convicted, he could have been sentenced to 
20 years in prison and fined millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Gotti was charged with taking part in a criminal enterprise  
known as the Gambino family, and extortion, robbery, loansharking, 
gambling and bribery. Many of the charges stemmed from an alleged 
extortion scheme at the Manhattan topless club Scores. 
</P>
<P>
	``I conspired with a group of individuals forming an  
association,'' Gotti told Judge Barrington Parker, although he did 
not mention the Gambino family by name. 
</P>
<P>
	He admitted bribing a union official, conspiring with others to  
commit extortion, supervising illegal gambling activities and 
filing a false income tax return. 
</P>
<P>
	Gotti entered the plea after learning that federal prosecutors  
in Brooklyn had planned to indict him on income tax and 
loansharking charges, said defense attorney Gerald Shargel. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government was putting Mr. Gotti in a position where he  
had no choice,'' Shargel said. He said Gotti pleaded guilty to 
bring ``finality and closure'' to the prosecutions. Among the 
charges he pleaded guilty to were the new loansharking charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Gotti said nothing as he exited the courthouse.  
</P>
<P>
	Sentencing was scheduled for July 8. Prosecutors said the term  
will range between five years and ten months, and seven years and 
two months. Defense attorneys said they will not challenge the 
judge's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the younger Gotti was accused of succeeding his father,  
John J. Gotti, at the top of the Gambino crime family after the 
elder Gotti was sent to prison for life in 1992, the case against 
him didn't allege any of the violence associated with the elder 
Gotti. 
</P>
<P>
	In the entire federal indictment against ``Junior,'' there was  
no mention of murder. No cement shoes, no sleeping with the fishes, 
no kiss on the lips followed by a bullet to the head. There wasn't 
even any leg-breaking. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not that kind of mob case,'' said Ronald Goldstock,  
former director of the state Organized Crime Task Force. ``You

</P>
<P>
	So many Mafia leaders are in prison and so many mobsters are

	Earlier on Monday, Gotti said of his impending trial: ``I'm  
excited. It's like my first day of school. It's like I'm starting 
kindergarten again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Gotti asked to be jailed during the trial so he  
wouldn't have to pay the $24,000 monthly cost of round-the-clock 
security guards that were a condition of his release on bail. He 
withdrew that request Monday because the judge ruled that he didn't 
have to pay for guards during the trial.

<HEADLINE> Bob Dylan, Paul Simon To Go on Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's nirvana for 1960s folk fans -- Bob Dylan and  
Paul Simon are hitting the road together for a summer tour. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the first time they have shared a concert bill.  
</P>
<P>
	Each man will play a 75-minute set and, for most of the tour's  
32 dates, they also plan a few duets. The tour starts June 6 in 
Colorado Springs, Colo., and ends at Jones Beach on New York's Long 
Island on July 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Dylan, who is almost constantly on the road and last year  
performed several dates with Van Morrison and Joni Mitchell, told 
USA Today he is excited about teaming up with Simon. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Software That Will Have You Hopping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	``Hip hop'' is what the Easter Bunny does, and ``scratching'' is  
a nasty thing to do to a phonograph record, right? 
</P>
<P>
	Not entirely. Those words take on new meanings in ``Hip Hop  
eJay,'' multimedia PC software from Voyetra Turtle Beach, in 
Yonkers, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	As any young person can tell you, hip hop is rap music with a  
melody line. And Voyetra, which has been doing nice things with 
sound for multimedia PCs for years, has created software that 
allows you to compose and play hip hop on your PC. 
</P>
<P>
	To compose a piece you need only select the desired effect --  
such as bass, guitar or drum -- to have a selection of sound clips 
appear. You can preview the clip with a mouse click and, if you 
approve, drag it to one of eight tracks at the top of the screen. 
(A track is an element in an overall musical composition. A 
symphony has a violin track, oboe track and so on.) 
</P>
<P>
	Zero musical knowledge is required. ``Hip Hop eJay'' handles the  
issue of keeping time by making sound elements of various lengths. 
If you want Track 1 and Track 2 to finish together, just make sure 
the elements are the same length visually. You just keep dragging 
various elements to tracks and listening to the result. 
</P>
<P>
	Scratch, it turns out, is the weird sounds you can make when a  
phonograph's tone arm is on the record and you move the turntable 
back and forth. It's what disc jockeys do at dance clubs, where 
young people gather, apparently to encourage hearing loss 
rhythmically. 
</P>
<P>
	In the software version, you can play your creation on the  
left-side turntable while manipulating the right-side turntable 
with a mouse. 
</P>
<P>
	You can also import sounds or record your voice. I recorded a  
one-minute hip-hop plea for my daughter to pay more attention to 
her books and less to her boyfriend, complete with seven other 
tracks of effects. The result made the dog growl at the speakers, 
and my daughter would have ignored it anyway, so it was on to new 
compositions. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if your idea of hip hop is what you do when that balky knee  
flares up, you'll find the software fun. And it's even more fun for 
a 20-something who actually understands what it's about. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hip Hop eJay'' requires a Pentium PC running Windows 95-98-NT,  
16 megabytes of RAM, 50 megabytes of hard disk space, a 256-color 
display, a 16-bit Direct Sound-compatible sound card, a doublespeed 
or better CD-ROM drive and, for recording, a microphone. 
</P>
<P>
	Voyetra products are available at retail. The street price is  
about $30.

<HEADLINE> Japan: Worst Over for Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese businesses grew slightly more confident  
about the country's economy during the first quarter, but they were 
still far from optimistic about the future, according to a survey 
released by Japan's central bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan said Monday business sentiment at major  
manufacturers improved slightly during the past three months, 
rising to minus 47 in March from December's minus 49, the lowest 
figure since February 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The report suggested Japan's massive economic stimulus measures  
-- including tax cuts and increased government spending -- have begun 
to break its economic slide. But analysts said the improvement has 
not come as quickly as many had hoped. 
</P>
<P>
	``This shows that the government isn't getting too much bang for  
its yen,'' said Andrew Shipley, economist at Schroders Securities 
in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said Tuesday that the worst was  
over for Japan's economy, but admitted a quick recovery was nowhere 
in sight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although the worst period for the economy is over, we cannot  
hope for a quick economic recovery given the low level of capital 
expenditures and the grave employment situation,'' Miyazawa said. 
</P>
<P>
	Taichi Sakaiya, the head of Japan's Economic Planning Agency  
agreed, saying Tuesday that the survey showed economic 
deterioration was slowing. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a feeling that the economy is nearing bottom. It's  
probably most accurate to say that (the tankan) backs up the 
(government's) view that deterioration of the economy is slowing,'' 
Sakaiya told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Echoing Miyazawa, however, he expressed pessimism on prospects  
the economy would recover. ``I can't say that it will rebound,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The improvement in business sentiment was the first since June  
1997. The index measures the percentage of firms seeing business 
conditions improve minus the percentage seeing conditions worsen. 
The central bank began conducting what's known as the ``tankan'' 
survey in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturers predicted their outlook would improve further by  
the time of the next survey. 
</P>
<P>
	But there were still plenty of signs that Japan economy has a  
long way to go in its recovery from its worst recession since World 
War II. Big companies surveyed forecast their capital spending 
would decline by 9.4 percent this fiscal year -- worse than their 
projections of a 5.4 percent drop for the last fiscal year, which 
ended March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``A full-fledged recovery has yet to start,'' Koji Tanami,  
Japan's top Finance Ministry official said at a press conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although the tankan showed some bright results such how people  
feel about future business conditions and the forecast for 
corporate profits, it indicated that capital investment has not 
emerged yet,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The tankan report was followed by other economic data that  
showed Japan's economy remains bogged down. 
</P>
<P>
	Average household spending tumbled 3.8 percent in December,  
further dimming hopes for an upswing in consumption, Japan's 
Management and Coordination Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the country's Economic Planning Agency said that the  
February index of leading indicators of the economy stood at 42.9, 
below the boom-or-bust threshold of 50.0 for the second straight 
month.

<HEADLINE> 76ers Coach Ends Spat With Iverson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Larry Brown knows the drill by now.  
</P>
<P>
	The Philadelphia 76ers coach has heard Allen Iverson bark at him  
every time he's taken the 23-year-old superstar out of a game for 
the past two years. He doesn't expect that to change, no matter how 
their latest dispute ends. 
</P>
<P>
	He just wants it to end.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a battle between me and him,'' Brown said Sunday as  
Iverson skipped the team's trip to Toronto after the two got into 
an argument on the bench. ``This is over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown told The Associated Press in a telephone interview that  
Iverson said he was too injured to go back into a game against 
Cleveland on Friday night after the two exchanged words on the 
sideline. Brown said both agreed Iverson would skip the team's 
brief road trip and get treatment on his leg. 
</P>
<P>
	Without Iverson, the NBA's leading scorer, the Sixers lost to  
the Raptors 97-82 Sunday night. Although Iverson said he's doubtful 
to play Tuesday night against Milwaukee, Brown expected him to be 
at practice today. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not even an issue,'' Brown said. ``He's still part of  
the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson, who played for two weeks with a deeply bruised thigh,  
did not play the opening 2:03 of the second quarter against the 
Cavaliers Friday night after going 0-for-7 in the first quarter. 
Brown generally rests Iverson at the end of the first or beginning 
of the second quarter to buy him a few extra minutes with the break 
between periods. 
</P>
<P>
	When Brown told Iverson to go back into the game, Iverson  
muttered something that reporters sitting near the Sixers' bench 
reported as, ``It's about ... time you put me back in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``So I sat him back down,'' Brown said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Sixers, slipping out of contention for the final playoff  
spot in the Eastern Conference because of a rash of injuries and 
spotty play, lost 85-80. Iverson sat out the final three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said it was Iverson's decision not to return to the game  
after the spat. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he couldn't go and that was it,'' Brown said. ``I'm  
not going to question any player on my team when he tells me he's 
injured.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Philadelphia Inquirer, quoting team sources it did not name,  
reported Sunday that Iverson considered leaving the arena during 
the Cleveland game and had to be persuaded by teammates to stay. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson was in Philadelphia getting treatment, and attempts by  
the Sixers to reach him for comment were unsuccessful. He severely 
bruised his right thigh in a collision with the Los Angeles Lakers' 
Shaquille O'Neal March 19, but tried to keep playing. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said Iverson told him Saturday he was too hurt to play,  
and the two agreed he should stay home and get treatment. After the 
game Friday night, Iverson tried to downplay the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	``There ain't no problems,'' Iverson said. ``Everything ain't  
going to be peaches and cream all the time. But I don't have any 
problems with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said Iverson objects every time the coach takes him out of  
a game, so he didn't see why this time became such a controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only big difference is, people heard his response when I  
put him in,'' Brown said. ``The biggest disappointment is, it was a 
big game, a game we really needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do I like getting yelled at every game? Absolutely not. But  
that's him. I understand that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown is not considering disciplinary action.  
</P>
<P>
	``My thing is, let's get over it,'' Brown said. ``What good is  
it going to do? How is it going to change anything unless it makes 
it worse?'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the latest in a series of flaps between Iverson and  
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the two publicly criticized each other to the point  
that Iverson vowed to ``remember everything come contract time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After signing a six-year, $70.9 million contract extension in  
January, Iverson said he and Brown had put their differences behind 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just had to mature,'' Iverson said. ``I realized that he was  
a great coach when I looked at his resume. It was important for me 
to put my pride aside and listen to what was said to me as a 
positive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just young, I had to do a lot of growing up.''  
</P>
<P>
	Then, Iverson had an unexcused absence from practice March 11.  
Forcing Iverson to be accountable to his teammates, Brown had the 
team decide how to handle it. Brown followed the players' 
recommendation not to suspend Iverson, but the 23-year-old guard 
was warned that further transgressions would be punished.

<HEADLINE> Celtics Leave Anderson at Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Boston guard Kenny Anderson didn't  
accompany the Celtics to Orlando for tonight's game against the 
Magic because of what was described as a personal decision by coach 
Rick Pitino. 
</P>
<P>
	Team spokesman Jeff Twiss said Anderson, who played in Sunday's  
91-79 loss at home to New Jersey, had not been suspended and is 
expected to rejoin the team before the Celtics face the Washington 
Wizards on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a personal coach's decision, not a one-game suspension,''  
Twiss said. ``He and Coach met, and that's it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, who played 31 minutes and had 13 points and three  
assists Sunday, was replaced in the starting lineup by Dana Barros. 
</P>
<P>
	The eighth-year pro had started 30 of 31 games before Monday  
night and is averaging 12.1 points and 5.9 assists.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Rises As Stocks Advance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against major currencies Monday  
as stocks rallied to record levels on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen retreated against the dollar after a report showing that  
sentiment among major Japanese manufacturers has improved, but 
remains lukewarm. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also gained against the euro amid the continuing  
turmoil in Yugoslavia, where NATO missiles and aircraft blasted 
Serbian targets for a 13th straight day while the allies readied a 
massive airlift for ethnic Albanian refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no trading in Europe and some Asia-Pacific countries  
due Easter observances. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0708, down  
from $1.0779 late Friday. The dollar also was quoted at 121.83 
Japanese yen, up from 120.55 yen on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the dollar drew some strength from Wall Street,  
where a stock rally drove the Dow Jones industrial average back 
above 10,000. The Dow rose 174.82 points to 10,007.33, squeezing 
past the March 29 closing high of 10,006.78. The Nasdaq composite 
index and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index also set new records. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign investors desiring U.S. stocks must buy dollars to  
transact business. 
</P>
<P>
	``The renewed strength of the Dow is pulling funds into the U.S.  
again. That's lifting the dollar against all currencies,'' said 
Douglas Porter, a senior economist with Nesbitt Burns Inc., a 
Toronto-based investment company subsidiary of the Bank of 
Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar started its rise, however, during Asian trading as  
traders reacted negatively to the latest Tankan report, a quarterly 
survey of business sentiment in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey, released Monday, showed that Japan manufacturers  
grew more optimistic about the economy during the first three 
months of 1999, but not as much as had been forecast. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, according to the survey, big companies are spending  
9.4 percent less on capital investment in the current fiscal year 
and smaller companies are projecting a 26 percent falloff. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Eisuke Sakakibara, Japan's influential vice Finance  
Minister for international affairs, reiterated his position that a 
sharp rise in the yen is undesirable, adding to fears the Bank of 
Japan would intervene in foreign exchange markets to support the 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4895 Swiss francs, up from  
1.4799, and 1.5020 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4960. The British 
pound fell to $1.6000 from $1.6036. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Monday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8265 German 
marks, up from 1.8146; 6.1275 French francs, up from 6.0864; and 
1,808.32 Italian lire, up from 1,795.33.

<HEADLINE> Suspect in Gay Attack Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- One of two young men charged in the slaying  
of gay college student Matthew Shepard pleaded guilty today and was 
sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell Henderson, 21, a high school dropout and roofer, pleaded  
guilty to felony murder and kidnapping, avoiding a trial and the 
possibility of the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Henderson and Aaron McKinney, 21, posed as  
homosexuals and lured the 5-foot-2, 105-pound Shepard out of a bar 
last October, kidnapped and pistol-whipped him and left him tied to 
a fence in the cold. The 21-year-old University of Wyoming student 
died five days later at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson said he drove the truck and helped tie Shepard to the  
fence, but blamed McKinney for the beating. He said he tried to 
stop the beating, but McKinney struck him when he spoke up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Matthew looked really bad, so I told (McKinney) to stop, he's  
had enough,'' Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson then apologized to Shepard's parents, Judy and Dennis:  
``I'm very sorry for what I did and I'm ready to pay my debt for 
what I did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Jeffrey A. Donnell dismissed his apology.  
</P>
<P>
	``This court does not believe you feel any remorse,'' Donnell  
said when he sentenced him. ``The pain you have caused here, Mr. 
Henderson, will never go away. Never.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson had been charged with first-degree murder, kidnapping  
and aggravated robbery in the beating death of Shepard. 
</P>
<P>
	The crime led to demands for stronger hate-crime laws around the  
country. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney will be tried in August on first-degree murder,  
kidnapping and aggravated robbery charges. He could be sentenced to 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	There had been speculation that if Henderson entered a plea, he  
would end up testifying against his friend and co-defendant. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's a plea bargain, the defense has to give something to  
the prosecution, such as his testimony against McKinney,'' said 
legal analyst Andrew Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Cal Rerucha opened jury selection by telling the  
prospective jurors that Shepard was ``not the same as you and I'' 
but that every individual should be treated equally under the 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	But Henderson's attorney, Wyatt Skaggs, said his client merely  
watched while the other man delivered the fatal blows to Shepard. 
He also said the slaying was not premeditated. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson's girlfriend is awaiting sentencing after pleading  
guilty Dec. 23 to accessory after the fact to murder. McKinney's 
girlfriend goes on trial in May on an accessory charge. 
</P>
<P>
	The case has moved to action activists on both sides of the gay  
rights issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Early today, a dozen young people dressed as angels, with white  
sheets for wings, tried to block from view an anti-gay group 
demonstrating outside the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	The angels stood silently, but inside their human wall about a  
dozen anti-gay demonstrators from Kansas shouted slogans and waved 
signs, including one that said ``God Hates Fags.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``These ... creatures are sending this nation to hell in a  
handbasket,'' said the Rev. Fred Phelps of Westboro Baptist Church. 
</P>
<P>
	Phelps and members of his Westboro Baptist Church also picketed  
Shepard's funeral in Casper with anti-gay signs.

<HEADLINE> Hanger Orthopedic Buys NovaCare Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BETHESDA, Md. (AP) -- Hanger Orthopedic Group Inc. is buying the  
prosthetics division of NovaCare Inc. to create the leading 
provider of prosthetic patient services in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal announced Monday, Hanger is paying $417 million  
and assuming $38 million in debt from Novacare Orthotics and 
Prosthetics Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company will retain the Hanger name and will remain  
headquartered in Bethesda. After the transaction, Hanger Orthopedic 
will have approximately 625 patient-care centers in 42 states. 
</P>
<P>
	``The merger of our company and NovaCare's O&AMP;P division  
establishes Hanger as the clear-cut industry leader,'' said Ivan 
Sabel, chief executive officer of Hanger Orthopedic. 
</P>
<P>
	Sabel will be chief executive of the combined company and Ron  
Hiscock, president of NovaCare, will be president and chief 
operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Orthotic and prosthetic services form a $2 billion segment of  
the rehabilitation industry. Hanger and NovaCare each operate 
patient-care centers staffed by medical professionals who design, 
fabricate, fit and supervise the use of artificial limbs. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of 1998, NovaCare operated 369 patient-care centers  
in 37 states. Hanger is the largest distributor in the country of 
custom-made and prefabricated orthotic and prosthetic devices.

<HEADLINE> Minn. Research Labs Vandalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Twelve University of Minnesota medical  
research labs were ransacked early Monday and 75 rats, pigeons, 
salamanders and mice were taken. 
</P>
<P>
	Computers were smashed, lab equipment was tipped over, and  
microscopes and photocopiers were wrecked. 
</P>
<P>
	Graffiti at the scene pointed to a group called the Animal  
Liberation Front, and later in the day a spokesman claimed 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ALF is taking action immediately to free these animals  
from their exploitation,'' Kevin Kjonaas said. He said the group 
had seized 100 animals and had found homes for them. 
</P>
<P>
	The animals were being used to research cancer, Parkinson's and  
other diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Walter Low, a researcher, said the damage set back the  
Alzheimer's studies alone by two years.

<HEADLINE> Good Start to New Baseball Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Right off the bat, Mark McGwire and baseball showed signs that  
1999 might be a repeat of a most remarkable season. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire hit home run No. 1 on opening day, just like he did last  
year on his way to a record-breaking 70. Big Mac thrilled a sellout 
crowd at Busch Stadium -- and no doubt, a whole nation looking on -- 
when connected Monday night in the fifth inning for the St. Louis 
Cardinals against Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	About a half-hour later, Ken Griffey Jr. also went deep. He did  
it for the Seattle Mariners in front of the career home run king, 
Hank Aaron, who threw out the first ball at the Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet even before McGwire and Griffey homered, fans had plenty to  
marvel about. 
</P>
<P>
	Cal Ripken, of all people, hurt himself and had to leave the  
game. Kevin Brown, the $105 million man, was knocked out in his 
matchup with Randy Johnson. Detroit's Brian Moehler took a no-hit 
bid into the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
	And, just like last year, there were home runs. Lots of them.  
</P>
<P>
	Albert Belle broke loose for Baltimore. Raul Mondesi went wild  
for Los Angeles. Jose Canseco connected for Tampa Bay. Bernard 
Gilkey hit two off Brown. Juan Encarnacion wasted no time -- he 
homered for the Tigers on the first pitch of the afternoon at 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	After an opening day appetizer Sunday night in Mexico between  
Colorado and San Diego, baseball began in earnest Monday with 11 
more openers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I call this my holy day,'' Orioles fan Robin Steel said at  
Camden Yards. ``That's what it is for those of us who worship in 
the church of baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The morning began with the traditional opening-day parade in  
Cincinnati. Later, ailing Andres Galarraga threw out the first ball 
at Atlanta, via TV hook-up from his home. At night, Roger Clemens 
made his debut for the World Series champion New York Yankees at 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	Sammy Sosa, who hit 66 last year, and the Chicago Cubs open  
Tuesday night at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year I was ready, but I think in 1999 I am more ready  
because a lot of people are expecting me and Mark to come back and 
do the same way,'' Sosa said after a workout. ``I have to say that 
he's ready and I'm ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Belle was ready, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Playing his first game for the Orioles, the star who figures to  
challenge for the home-run lead this year in cozy Camden Yards hit 
a three-run homer that highlighted a 10-7 win over Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle's teammates and the crowd of 46,733 gave him a standing  
ovation, and the surly slugger responded with a rare curtain call. 
Belle also had an RBI single, more than enough to offset Canseco's 
398th lifetime homer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles won despite losing Ripken, who left in the third  
inning because of a stiff lower back. Ripken, who voluntarily ended 
his record streak of 2,632 straight games last year, was listed as 
day-to-day. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the game, the Orioles unveiled a large, orange ``7'' in  
the third-base coaching box to honor Cal Ripken Sr., who died March 
24 of lung cancer at 63. 
</P>
<P>
	Cal Jr. did not get any hits, leaving him 122 short of 3,000.  
But Wade Boggs singled twice for the Devil Rays, giving him 76 
short of the milestone. 
</P>
<P>
	Mondesi delivered the biggest hits. His three-run homer with two  
outs in the bottom of the ninth tied it, and his two-run homer in 
the 11th lifted Los Angeles over Arizona 8-6. 
</P>
<P>
	Moehler, meanwhile, was the day's pitching star -- rather than  
Brown or Johnson. There was no evidence that umpires were calling 
higher strikes, as the commissioner's office ordered them to do. 
</P>
<P>
	Moehler came within eight outs of joining Bob Feller as the only  
pitchers to throw no-hitters on opening day as Detroit defeated 
Texas 11-5. Juan Gonzalez broke up Moehler's bid with a one-out 
single in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure, I was thinking about it,'' Moehler said.  
</P>
<P>
	His performance was far better than anything from the day's two  
marquee matchups -- Johnson vs. Brown at Dodger Stadium or Curt 
Schilling vs. Tom Glavine at Turner Field. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, baseball's first $100 million man, gave up three home  
runs for the Dodgers. Johnson, who signed for $52.4 million, was 
so-so for the Diamondbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	At Atlanta, neither Schilling nor Glavine was especially sharp  
as Philadelphia beat the Braves 7-4. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kansas City Royals once again proved that nothing counts  
until opening day. After posting baseball's best exhibition record 
at 22-9, they lost 5-3 to Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida Marlins, however, got off to a fine start. Worst in  
the majors last year with 108 losses, they beat the New York Mets 
6-2. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have a lot of fun this year,'' new Marlins  
owner John Henry said.

<HEADLINE> Hall of Fame Pitcher Wynn Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Early Wynn, who won the Cy Young Award at age  
39 and earned his 300th and last victory four years later, died 
last night. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hall of Famer's health had deteriorated badly in recent  
months and he died in Florida from complications related to a 
stroke, his business manager, Dave Baudouin, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wynn spent his final days at Manor Care Health Services in  
Venice, Fla., said Eric Swope, funeral director at Ewing Funeral 
Home in Venice. 
</P>
<P>
	Born Jan. 6, 1920, Wynn pitched in the major leagues from 1939  
to 1963 with Washington, Cleveland and the Chicago White Sox. Wynn, 
who won 164 games with Cleveland, was known as one of the fiercest 
competitors of his time. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'd knock you down in the dugout,'' New York Yankees great  
Mickey Mantle said of Wynn. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked once if he would throw at his grandmother, the burly Wynn  
quipped: ``Only if she was digging in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Wynn's toughness had a serious side. In 1949, when he was  
playing with Cleveland, a Detroit pitcher twice knocked down 
Indians outfielder Larry Doby, the first black player in the 
American League. Wynn knocked down the pitcher on four straight 
pitches when he came to bat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doby is on my team,'' said Wynn, a native of Hartford, Ala.  
``If they hurt him, they hurt me. I've got to teach them manners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wynn was a 20-game winner four times for Cleveland and once for  
the White Sox in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 23-11 in 1954, when the Indians won the American League  
pennant with 111 wins in a 154-game season. In 1959, he won the Cy 
Young Award for the pennant-winning White Sox, posting a 22-10 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow Hall of Famer and Cleveland teammate Bob Feller  
remembered Wynn as a great player to have in the clubhouse and on 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``Early was afraid of no one,'' he said. ``We'll miss him. We  
worked together, traveled together and socialized together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wynn was also a good hitter, with 17 career home runs and he hit  
.319 for Washington in 1946. He was used as a pinch hitter on 
several occasions. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1963, at age 43, he returned to the Indians needing one more  
win for 300. He reached the milestone on July 13, 1963, pitching 
the first five innings of Cleveland's 5-4 victory in Kansas City. 
His career record was 300-244. 
</P>
<P>
	After he retired, Wynn was a pitching coach for the Indians and  
Minnesota Twins. He also campaigned for increasing retired 
ballplayers' pensions. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 
1972. 
</P>
<P>
	Wynn's wife of 50 years, Lorraine, died in 1994. Wynn is  
survived by a daughter and son, a half-sister and three 
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	Visitation will be on Saturday before a service at the Ewing  
Funeral Home, Swope said.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets closed generally mixed  
Monday, with the key indexes rising in Tokyo and Singapore, but 
falling in Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur. Many other bourses remained 
closed for the Easter holidays. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo stocks rose after the Japanese central bank announced an  
improvement in corporate sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 44.59 points,  
or 0.27 percent, to finish the day at 16,334.78 points. On Friday, 
the average closed down 37.37 points, or 0.23 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In its closely-watched quarterly ``tankan'' survey, the Bank of  
Japan reported business sentiment at large manufacturers improved 
moderately from the previous tankan, prompting hope that the 
economy has bottomed out. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei average was up more than 300 points at one point in  
morning trading after the release of the survey, but share prices 
fell back in the afternoon as traders pocketed profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the moderate upswing in corporate confidence cheered the  
market, and investors were eager to buy on any significant dips, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 121.36 yen in late  
afternoon trading, up 0.70 yen from late Friday in Tokyo and also 
above its late New York level of 120.55 yen on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Singapore, share prices closed sharply higher on growing  
optimism about an economic recovery in Asia. The benchmark Straits 
Times Index rose 2.4 percent, or 36.41 points, to 1,581.60. 
</P>
<P>
	Dealers noted that the perception that Asian economies, led by  
Japan, have hit a bottom is encouraging an inflow of funds into the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
	Philippine shares also closed higher in thin trading, buoyed by  
bargain hunting of selected blue chips and second-tier companies, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-company Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 12.96  
points, or 0.6 percent, to 2,041.17. 
</P>
<P>
	Thai share prices closed lower as investors sold finance stocks  
on worries about the financial status of some of the weaker finance 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stock Exchange of Thailand index (SET) fell 6.37 points, or  
1.8 percent, to 350.73. 
</P>
<P>
	Malaysian share prices also closed lower as investors took  
profits following recent gains. The key Composite Index, which 
tracks 100 blue-chip stocks, fell 4.23 points, or 0.7 percent, to 
535.84. 
</P>
<P>
	In Indonesia, share prices closed mixed. The key Composite Index  
edged up 0.904 point, or 0.2 percent, to 395.337. 
</P>
<P>
	The markets were closed in Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and  
South Korea for the Easter holidays.

<HEADLINE> Defendants Have Right to Silence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Judges cannot heap stiffer punishment on  
criminal defendants who, after pleading guilty, refuse to give 
details about the crime at sentencing, the Supreme Court said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Holding such defendants' silence against them would impose ``an  
impermissible burden on the exercise of the constitutional right 
against compelled self-incrimination,'' the court ruled 5-4 in a 
Pennsylvania drug case. 
</P>
<P>
	The Constitution's Fifth Amendment states that no one ``shall be  
compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.'' 
In 1965, the nation's highest court ruled that criminal trial 
juries cannot hold defendants' silence against them. 
</P>
<P>
	Writing for the court on Monday, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy  
said, ``Treating a guilty plea as a waiver of the privilege at 
sentencing would be a grave encroachment on the rights of 
defendants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That would let prosecutors indict someone in a drug case without  
specifying the amount of drugs involved, obtain a guilty plea and 
then use the defendant's testimony at sentencing to establish the 
amount of drugs, Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The result would be to enlist the defendant as an instrument  
in his or her own condemnation,'' he said. He added, however, that 
the justices were not deciding whether such defendants' silence at 
sentencing could be viewed as showing a lack of remorse. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy's opinion was joined by Justices John Paul Stevens,  
David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Dissenting were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices  
Antonin Scalia, Sandra Day O'Connor and Clarence Thomas. They 
agreed that defendants who plead guilty can refuse to testify at 
sentencing, but said judges should be allowed to hold it against 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no reason why the Fifth Amendment should shield a  
defendant ``from the natural and appropriate consequences of her 
uncooperativeness at the sentencing stage,'' Scalia wrote for the 
dissenters. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's ruling reversed a lower court decision that said  
defendants who plead guilty forfeit the right to remain silent at 
their sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
	Amanda Mitchell of Allentown, Pa., invoked that right in  
refusing to testify at a sentencing hearing about the extent of her 
involvement in a cocaine-selling ring. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell was charged along with 22 other people. She pleaded  
guilty in 1995 to federal charges of conspiracy and distributing 
cocaine, but she reserved the question of her level of culpability 
for the amount of cocaine she actually distributed. 
</P>
<P>
	At her sentencing, Mitchell refused to answer when the judge  
asked about her level of involvement. The judge sentenced her to 10 
years in prison, saying the testimony of other witnesses 
established that she had distributed more than 13 kilograms of 
cocaine over a two-year period. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge specifically said he drew a negative inference from  
Mitchell's refusal to discuss details of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``I held it against you that you didn't come forward today,''  
the judge said, adding that Mitchell had no Fifth Amendment right 
to remain silent because she waived that right when pleading 
guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed, saying she lacked  
constitutional protection even though her refusal to testify 
created a risk of harsher punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court reversed. ``The government retains the burden  
of proving facts relevant to the crime at the sentencing phase and 
cannot enlist the defendant in this process at the expense of the 
self-incrimination privilege,'' Kennedy wrote.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Air Canada Exec To World Airways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HERNDON, Va. (AP) -- Hollis L. Harris, president and chairman of  
Air Canada since January 1993, has been named to the same position 
at charter carrier World Airways Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris will succeed Russell L. Ray Jr. on May 1, World Airways  
announced Monday. Ray is retiring but will continue as a director 
of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Before joining Air Canada, Harris was chairman of Air Eagle  
Holdings, an aviation consulting firm he founded with four 
partners. He previously served as president of Continental Airlines 
and Delta Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	World Airways is a charter carrier operating a fleet of 12  
widebody MD-11 and DC-10-30 aircraft. The company offered a limited 
number of regular passenger flights earlier this decade but 
suspended them in 1996 because they proved unprofitable.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Refugee Office in D.C. Busy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sorrowful tales about refugees streaming out  
of Kosovo got gloomier as the day unfolded at this tiny United 
Nations office. Relief workers called with frantic accounts of 
refugees herded onto trains at gunpoint. E-mails told of torched 
villages. Situation reports detailed the exodus by the numbers -- 
the tents, blankets and sanitation kits required. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucked into the third floor of an office building a few blocks  
from the White House, the Washington office of the U.N. High 
Commissioner for Refugees is in crisis mode. 
</P>
<P>
	At this nerve center, which coordinates U.S. efforts to help  
Kosovo, workers jog-walk from desk to desk. Road maps of the 
Balkans are taped to the wall. The telephone rings incessantly with 
calls from Capitol Hill, volunteers, donors and humanitarian 
workers handling a crisis some 4,700 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	There are logistical problems, political problems,  
communications problems. Links between the office and the high 
commissioner's headquarters in Geneva often are jammed. 
Conversations with humanitarian workers on static-filled mobile 
phones end abruptly when satellite connections fail. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can you tell me about the situation in Blace?'' Jennifer Dean,  
an employee at the U.N. office, asked Benny Otim, a worker 
stationed at a Kosovo-Macedonia border crossing in a weekend call. 
``Are they processing people through there smoothly right now?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The line goes dead. ``Benny? Benny?'' Dean shouted into the  
receiver. ``Lost him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before it's even 8 a.m. in Washington (2 p.m. in Kosovo), Ms.  
Dean has already updated refugee numbers, called headquarters and 
reviewed her telephone voice mail. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm getting telephone calls from Georgia, Kentucky, Tennessee,  
Oregon, California -- people wanting to help, wanting to give 
donations, wanting to organize fund drives,'' she says. Money is 
the best gift now when emergency supplies need to be purchased 
locally, she advises. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Dean also fields calls from Americans who have relatives in  
Kosovo. ``They're just terrified,'' she says. ``They can't get a 
hold of them. It's really awful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Televised images of the refugees make it easy for Americans to  
understand their humanitarian needs. 
</P>
<P>
	More challenging is comprehending their political problems.  
</P>
<P>
	In simple terms, Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the dominant  
republic of the Yugoslav federation. The Serbs view Kosovo, which 
is about the size of Connecticut, as ancestral land. They want it 
to remain a part of Serbia. Ninety percent of the people who live 
in Kosovo, however, are ethnic Albanians. They want independence 
from the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Since NATO airstrikes began March 24, the Serbs have forced more  
than 360,000 Kosovars out of the province. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kosovars are leaving by train, bus, car, tractor and wagon.  
Some have trekked in snow over mountain passes to the safety of 
neighboring Macedonia to the south, Albania to the southwest and 
Montenegro to the west. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is really an organized emptying of Kosovo,'' Panos  
Moumtzis, senior public information officer at the refugee office , 
says between answering the phone and scanning 100 e-mails received 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	One day last week, Moumtzis kept one eye on a television set  
where his boss, Karen Koning AbuZayd, the U.S. representative to 
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, was appearing on C-SPAN. 
``The majority of people coming out are women and children,'' she 
tells the TV audience. ``We do need to ask `Where are the men?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Every day, Moumtzis scans a stack of e-mails, such as one  
received over the weekend from Geneva. Written by a relief worker 
in Albania, it said: ``People arriving on foot are mostly women and 
children. People exhausted. ... Staff worked all night transferring 
new arrivals to a school nearby. Also distributed blankets, water 
and (high protein) bisquits. Many elderly are sick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Moumtzis talks on the phone to relief workers like Otim at a  
border crossing in Macedonia. Otim tells him that refugee 
registration slowed again when buses transporting refugees inland 
couldn't return to the border. 
</P>
<P>
	Otim says 300 refugees refused to get out of the buses at a  
camp. They preferred to stay with host families -- an issue now moot 
because the swelling number of refugees has forced the government 
to set up camps. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hang in there, Benny,'' Ms. Dean says before he signs off.

<HEADLINE> Wynette's Daughters File Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Three of Tammy Wynette's daughters filed  
a $50 million lawsuit blaming the singer's death on negligence by 
her husband and her doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	Daughters Tina Jones, Jackie Daly and Georgette Smith said  
Monday that Wynette died because Dr. Wallis Marsh didn't monitor 
her condition closely and overprescribed medication. 
</P>
<P>
	They also said Wynette's husband, George Richey, didn't seek  
medical care for her after being urged to do so by Marsh on the day 
of her death. 
</P>
<P>
	Marsh ``inappropriately treated her in a number of different  
ways,'' said Ed Yarbrough, an attorney for the daughters. ``It 
became clear that her husband was very much a party to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Stand by Your Man'' singer died on April 6, 1998, at her  
Nashville home at age 55. Marsh signed the death certificate, 
listing the cause of death as a blood clot in the lungs. 
</P>
<P>
	Telephone messages for Richey and his lawyer were not returned  
Monday. A call to Marsh's lawyers also was not returned.

<HEADLINE> 'Xena' Episode Yanked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An episode of ``Xena: Warrior Princess'' has  
been yanked from worldwide syndication after criticism from Hindu 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Renaissance Pictures, the show's producer, apologized Monday for  
offending members of the Hindu community and said it had no plans 
for further episodes involving Hindu deities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly had no intention of offending anyone,'' the  
studio said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Hindu protesters said they were frustrated when  
studio executives wouldn't meet with them to hear their concerns 
about the show's portrayal of Lord Krishna and Hanuman. 
</P>
<P>
	Using the deities in the action-adventure series, which stars  
Lucy Lawless as Xena, was an affront to those who worship them, 
said Tusta Krishnadas of the World Vaishnava Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The episode first aired in February.  
</P>
<P>
	If a decision is made to re-air the episode, changes would be  
made with guidance from Sunil Aghi, president of the Indo-Americans 
Political Foundation, Renaissance said.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Reiterates Kosovo Stance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The American-led NATO air campaign against  
Yugoslavia will continue ``unceasing and unrelenting'' until 
President Slobodan Milosevic reverses course in Kosovo, President 
Clinton said Monday as the alliance reported a quickened pace of 
airstrikes and the arrival of more firepower. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our plan is to persist until we prevail,'' Clinton said at the  
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Anticipating that Milosevic may soon declare his goals in Kosovo  
achieved and propose peace, the Clinton administration pointedly 
declared that it will not tolerate a Kosovo emptied of ethnic 
Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	``Milosevic may think he's finished'' at that point, Pentagon  
spokesman Kenneth Bacon said. ``We will not be finished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Previewing a planned bolstering of NATO's airpower, Defense  
Secretary William Cohen said U.S. Army Apache attack helicopters 
would target Serb military and police forces that are now ``open 
and vulnerable'' in Kosovo. The helicopters probably will not be 
ready for action for more than a week, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going after his tanks, his armored units, his artillery,  
those forces on the ground that are carrying out this horrific 
ethnic cleansing,'' Cohen said in an Associated Press interview. 
``They are going to be targeted now and taken out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R.-Ill., dated  
Sunday, Clinton said the Apaches and supporting forces would 
operate from Albania. ``The mission does not include any planned 
deployment of ground troops'' into Kosovo, Clinton said. The 
duration of the mission ``will depend on the course of events,'' he 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	In his remarks Monday at the White House, Clinton said Milosevic  
faced a choice of ending the violence against ethnic Albanians in 
Kosovo or watching NATO systematically diminish the Yugoslav 
leader's ability to impose his will on Kosovo and stay in power. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know we are up against a dictator who has shown time and  
again that he would rather rule over rubble than not rule at all, 
someone who recognizes no limits on his behavior except those 
imposed by others,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Mr. Milosevic does not do what is necessary, NATO will  
continue an air campaign. It will be undiminished, unceasing and 
unrelenting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even as it worked out plans for expanding U.S. military  
involvement in Kosovo, the administration was scrambling on the 
humanitarian front. It flew more emergency relief supplies to 
Albania and worked on plans for accommodating 20,000 Kosovar 
refugees, probably at the Guantanamo Naval Station in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen and other administration officials insisted that the  
decision to airlift refugees out of the Balkans was not meant to 
indicate NATO had given up its goal of reversing the forced exodus 
from Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a temporary arrangement designed to deal with an  
emergency problem; it's not designed to have permanent relocation 
of these refugees,'' said State Department spokesman James P. 
Rubin. He said the idea was to ``alleviate the bottleneck'' of 
hundreds of thousands of refugees in Albania and Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had received a  
report on the plight of the ethnic Albanians inside Kosovo from 
David Sheffer, the U.S. ambassador-at-large for war crimes. Based 
on interviews he conducted with refugees, Sheffer concluded that 
Albanians are being driven from Kosovo not by NATO bombing but by a 
systematic expulsion by Serb military and police forces, Rubin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheffer reported that Pristina, the Kosovar capital, is being  
expunged neighborhood by neighborhood with seemingly calculated 
efficiencies. He said Kosovars are shaken down for their cash, 
money and jewelry, and those who resist expulsion are killed by 
gunfire or by torching their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The use of Apache helicopters, subject to final approval by NATO  
political authorities and by President Clinton, would mark an 
important turning point in the allies' war in Yugoslavia. The 
higher-flying NATO jets used so far have been unable to make a dent 
in the Serb armed forces operating in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are now open and vulnerable to this kind of an attack,''  
Cohen said. ``The Apaches are a very capable aircraft that will go 
in low and start to target them individually. It has a good deal of 
firepower and is going to represent an enormous challenge to the 
forces in opposition. He's going to be paying a high penalty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Apaches, used heavily against Iraqi forces in the 1991 Gulf War,  
are armed with laser-guided anti-tank missiles. Their crews are 
trained to fly low to the ground, either day or night, and in most 
kinds of weather. 
</P>
<P>
	In Kosovo, the Apaches would face a considerable threat from a  
variety of Serb air defense weapons, including shoulder-fired guns 
and anti-aircraft artillery. To suppress that threat, the Army 
plans to deploy multiple launch rocket systems to Albania armed 
with long-range missiles that can hit air defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	As NATO presses ahead with its bombing under clearing skies in  
Yugoslavia, officials at U.S. European Command in Germany began 
assembling Task Force Hawk, which will have 24 Apache helicopters, 
plus a variety of support forces, including 26 UH-60 Blackhawk and 
CH-47 Chinook helicopters, for cargo lifting and medical 
evacuation. The Army force would involve about 2,600 soldiers, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO officials were expected to give their formal OK to the use  
of Apaches, although the decision lay in Clinton's hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Cohen spokesman Kenneth Bacon said Sunday that the 24  
Apache attack helicopters offered to NATO could be in place in 
Albania in seven to 10 days, Army officials speaking privately said 
Monday it might take two weeks or longer to get the full contingent 
of about 2,600 soldiers in place. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Navy aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt and  
its battle group entered the Adriatic Sea on Monday. The carrier's 
contingent of F/A-18 Hornet and other strike aircraft are expected 
to begin flying missions on Tuesday. The battle group includes 
three ships and one submarine armed with Tomahawk cruise missiles, 
which have been a key weapon in NATO's air campaign.

<HEADLINE> Good Start to New Baseball Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Right off the bat, baseball showed signs that 1999 might be a  
repeat of a most remarkable season. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa took their first swings,  
fans had plenty to marvel at Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cal Ripken, of all people, hurt himself and had to leave the  
game. Kevin Brown, the $105 million man, was knocked out in his 
matchup with Randy Johnson. Detroit's Brian Moehler took a no-hit 
bid into the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
	And, just like last year, there were home runs. Lots of them.  
</P>
<P>
	Albert Belle broke loose for Baltimore. Raul Mondesi went wild  
for Los Angeles. Jose Canseco connected for Tampa Bay. Bernard 
Gilkey hit two off Brown. Juan Encarnacion wasted no time -- he 
homered for the Tigers on the first pitch of the afternoon at 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	After an opening day appetizer Sunday night in Mexico between  
Colorado and San Diego, baseball began in earnest Monday with 11 
more openers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I call this my holy day,'' Orioles fan Robin Steel said at  
Camden Yards. ``That's what it is for those of us who worship in 
the church of baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The morning began with the traditional opening-day parade in  
Cincinnati. Later, ailing Andres Galarraga threw out the first ball 
at Atlanta, via TV hook-up from his home. At night, Roger Clemens 
was to make his debut for the World Series champion New York 
Yankees at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, coming off his record 70-homer season, and the St.  
Louis Cardinals had to wait out rain showers to start their opener 
against Milwaukee. When they began, McGwire got a standing ovation 
at Busch Stadium before walking in his first plate appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa, who hit 66 last year, and the Chicago Cubs open Tuesday  
night at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year I was ready, but I think in 1999 I am more ready  
because a lot of people are expecting me and Mark to come back and 
do the same way,'' Sosa said after a workout. ``I have to say that 
he's ready and I'm ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Belle was ready, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Playing his first game for the Orioles, the star who figures to  
challenge for the home-run lead this year in cozy Camden Yards hit 
a three-run homer that highlighted a 10-7 win over Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle's teammates and the crowd of 46,733 gave him a standing  
ovation, and the surly slugger responded with a rare curtain call. 
Belle also had an RBI single, more than enough to offset Canseco's 
398th career homer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles won despite losing Ripken, who left in the third  
inning because of a stiff lower back. There was no word on whether 
Ripken, who voluntarily ended his record streak of 2,632 straight 
games last year, would miss any more time. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the game, the Orioles unveiled a large, orange ``7'' in  
the third-base coaching box to honor Cal Ripken Sr., who died March 
24 of lung cancer at 63. 
</P>
<P>
	Cal Jr. did not get any hits, leaving him 122 short of 3,000.  
But Wade Boggs singled twice for the Devil Rays, giving him 76 
short of the milestone. 
</P>
<P>
	Mondesi delivered the biggest hits. His three-run homer with two  
outs in the bottom of the ninth tied it, and his two-run homer in 
the 11th lifted Los Angeles over Arizona 8-6. 
</P>
<P>
	Moehler, meanwhile, was the day's pitching star -- rather than  
Brown or Johnson. There was no evidence that umpires were calling 
higher strikes, as the commissioner's office ordered them to do. 
</P>
<P>
	Moehler came within eight outs of joining Bob Feller as the only  
pitchers to throw no-hitters on opening day as Detroit defeated 
Texas 11-5. Juan Gonzalez broke up Moehler's bid with a one-out 
single in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure, I was thinking about it,'' Moehler said.  
</P>
<P>
	His performance was far better than anything from the day's two  
marquee matchups -- Johnson vs. Brown at Dodger Stadium or Curt 
Schilling vs. Tom Glavine at Turner Field. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, baseball's first $100 million man, gave up three home  
runs for the Dodgers. Johnson, who signed for $52.4 million, was 
so-so for the Diamondbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	At Atlanta, neither Schilling nor Glavine was especially sharp  
as Philadelphia beat the Braves 7-4. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kansas City Royals once again proved that nothing counts  
until opening day. After posting baseball's best exhibition record 
at 22-9, they lost 5-3 to Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida Marlins, however, got off to a fine start. Worst in  
the majors last year with 108 losses, they beat the New York Mets 
6-2. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have a lot of fun this year,'' new Marlins  
owner John Henry said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Sends Ship to Mediterranean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia has sent only one warship into the  
Mediterranean to monitor NATO operations against Yugoslavia, 
although it has permission to send seven more, a navy spokesman 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov again called for a  
halt to the NATO airstrikes in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to say again that the barbaric NATO bombardments are a  
tragic mistake,'' Primakov told the ITAR-Tass news agency. ``They 
not only destabilize the situation in Kosovo, but lead todirectly 
opposite results in this region, the Balkans, and Europe as a 
whole.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russia strongly opposes the strikes, but its response has been  
largely symbolic. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscow has sent one intelligence-gathering ship, the Liman, from  
its Black Sea port, through the Bosporus strait and on to the 
Mediterranean. Russia dispatched the ship to keep an eye on NATO 
warships participating in the attacks on Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey, a NATO member that controls the Bosporus, has given  
Russia permission to send seven additional ships through the narrow 
strait and on to the Mediterranean. The timetable authorized three 
ships to pass through the strait on Sunday and another four by 
Thursday.

<P>
	But Russia said today that six additional ships that might be  
sent to the region were still on standby at the Black Sea port of 
Sevastopol. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Liman is in the Mediterranean now,'' said Navy spokesman  
Igor Dygalo. ``The other six ships are in full readiness at their 
base. If a political decision is adopted ... they can go at any 
minute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear why Russia had not sent the additional ships.  
</P>
<P>
	NATO would prefer that the Russian ships stay out of the  
Mediterranean, although President Boris Yeltsin has said repeatedly 
that Moscow will not become involved militarily in the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, an anti-NATO group said more than 800 Russians had  
volunteered to fight alongside Yugoslav forces. However, the 
Popular Patriotic Front said it was only registering volunteers at 
this point and was not sending anyone to Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia is an ally of Yugoslavia, but Russia's desperate economic  
situation and declining military might have put severe constraints 
on its ability to influence NATO. The armed forces have been 
deteriorating for years, and the country badly needs Western loans 
to keep the tattered economy afloat.

<HEADLINE> Nazi Slaves Still Feel Victimized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- Eugeniusz Szobski can't forget toiling on  
the German assembly line, making car engines 12 hours a day, 
dressed in concentration camp stripes, then sleeping in filthy, 
lice-infested barracks. 
</P>
<P>
	His six months as a Nazi slave laborer at the Daimler-Benz  
factory near Mannheim ended in 1945 only because he caught typhus 
and then the war soon stopped. More than 700 of his 1,060 coworkers 
had died. 
</P>
<P>
	For compensation, Szobski got 1,100 zloty from the Polish-German  
Reconciliation Foundation in the early 1990s. That is about $280. 
</P>
<P>
	``One day of my work was worth a package of cigarettes,'' the  
75-year-old says bitterly. 
</P>
<P>
	He and other Polish survivors of German slave labor and  
concentration camps feel they are being victimized again, simply 
for being Poles. They point to survivors in Western countries who 
are being paid thousands of dollars by Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany says the situation is different because Poland's postwar  
communist government renounced compensation claims in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
	After communist rule fell in 1989, however, Poland's new  
democratic government pushed for compensation, and Germany paid 
$277 million, while stressing the money was humanitarian aid and 
not compensation. That is the money that provided the payment to 
Szobski and others. 
</P>
<P>
	Angry over the small payments, Szobski and 10 other aging Poles  
have taken their claims to a new arena: a class-action lawsuit in 
New Jersey seeking compensation from German companies doing 
business in America that benefitted from Nazi-era forced labor. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been a segregation of victims after the war,'' said  
Jacek Turczynski, head of the reconciliation foundation, which is 
helping the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want a global solution'' to the compensation issue, he  
added. ``We hope that thanks to filing the lawsuit in the United 
States, America will become a spokesman for all victims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Germany has paid more than $57 billion to Nazi victims since  
World War II, including the money paid to Poland. Polish victims 
received less than 1 percent of the compensation even though Poles 
accounted for about a third of 7 million slave laborers, 
Turczynski's foundation says. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only because we are Polish, we are treated differently,''  
Szobski said. ``We have already experienced the Nazi theory of 
super-humans and sub-humans. Are we again sub-humans?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Holocaust victims in the United States launched a  
legal campaign against Swiss banks and German businesses that 
operate in America. The pressure forced the companies to address 
the claims, and Switzerland's two largest banks agreed in August to 
pay $1.25 billion to holders of dormant wartime accounts and their 
heirs. 
</P>
<P>
	A separate fund set up last year by German automaker Volkswagen  
has compensated at least 200 people so far, including a dozen 
Poles. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve of Germany's largest companies, responding to more U.S.  
lawsuits, pledged recently to set up a similar fund to pay 
reparations to slave laborers, including those from eastern Europe. 
But few details about the fund -- how many victims will be eligible, 
how much they will receive -- have been settled. 
</P>
<P>
	The Polish survivors filed their own suit because they feared  
they might be excluded from a possible settlement between the 
German companies and victims living in the United States, or be 
offered less money. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as there were no lawsuits, German companies refused to  
talk,'' Turczynski said. ``Our lawsuit is intended to force German 
businesses to talk about our claims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers and historians say Poland's 1953 declaration doesn't  
exclude compensation for individuals, so the Polish claimants are 
free to join in the U.S. court claims against German firms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Poles can file lawsuits in the United States as long as  
companies have assets here,'' said Allyn Z. Lite, the New Jersey 
lawyer representing the Poles. 
</P>
<P>
	Turczynski's foundation says the class-action lawsuit seeks at  
least $5,560 for each of the 450,000 surviving slave laborers 
registered with the group, for a total of $2.5 billion. That is 
about one-tenth the back wages owed Poles for their forced labor, 
the foundation says. 
</P>
<P>
	Jozef Wolan, one of the plaintiffs, was 16 when he was forced to  
work on a German farm in February 1942. 
</P>
<P>
	He received $380 in compensation for 38 months of work that  
included carrying 150-pound sacks of grain and unloading tons of 
sugar beets daily during harvest season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that somebody will notice us finally,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Cancer Drug May Fight Heart Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The experimental drug that caused a sensation when  
it was found to wipe out cancer in mice by choking off the tumors' 
blood supply is also showing promise against heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The treatment involves the Harvard-developed drug endostatin,  
which has been shown to be remarkably potent against cancer but has 
not been tested yet on people. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the same team that discovered endostatin found that in  
mice, at least, the drug may also greatly slow the development of 
atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries. Atherosclerosis is a 
buildup of fatty deposits. 
</P>
<P>
	The research raises the possibility that a new category of  
drugs, the blood vessel inhibitors, may be useful weapons against 
both heart disease and cancer, the two most important diseases of 
the industrialized world. 
</P>
<P>
	A team led by Dr. Judah Folkman of Harvard Medical School and  
Children's Hospital in Boston reported the development in Tuesday's 
issue of the American Heart Association journal Circulation. 
</P>
<P>
	Folkman pioneered the study of angiogenesis, the growth of new  
blood vessels. Endostatin is a natural protein that blocks blood 
vessel formation. Without a blood supply, cancer in lab animals 
often stops growing and disappears. 
</P>
<P>
	Heart disease also involves unwanted tissue growth -- the  
accumulation of cholesterol, blood cells and smooth muscle cells in 
lumps known as plaque. Plaque growing in the heart arteries is the 
chief cause of heart attacks and angina pain. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts have long noticed that plaque often has its own network  
of tiny blood vessels called capillaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``By blocking them, perhaps we can alter the progression of the  
disease,'' said Dr. Karen Moulton, who conducted the experiment in 
Folkman's lab. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 16-week experiment involving 73 mice, the researchers  
tested endostatin on animals that were fed a high-cholesterol diet. 
They found that those on the drug averaged 85 percent less plaque 
buildup in their hearts' aortas than did untreated animals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very exciting concept,'' said Dr. Stephen Epstein of  
Washington Hospital Center in Washington. ``If the data can be 
validated by other labs, it represents a whole new paradigm for 
strategies to prevent atherosclerosis and its complications.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Epstein acknowledged that the discovery also presents  
``a very important conundrum,'' because drugs that promote blood 
vessel growth, rather than block it, are already one of the hottest 
areas of heart disease research. 
</P>
<P>
	Epstein and others are testing the use of growth proteins that  
trigger the body to sprout new blood vessels. When injected into 
the heart, these proteins induce the growth of a new blood supply. 
This nourishes heart muscle that is starved by clogged arteries. 
</P>
<P>
	Some human testing suggests this treatment can relieve the  
effects of atherosclerosis. But Epstein said the latest work raises 
the possibility that it could also make the underlying disease 
worse by promoting the growth of plaque. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Dr. Jeffrey Isner of St. Elizabeth's Medical Center in  
Boston said his own animal experiments show no evidence that 
stimulating the growth of blood vessels will speed up 
atherosclerosis or do anything else bad. 
</P>
<P>
	Moulton speculated that both treatments could eventually find a  
place in controlling heart disease. Blood vessel inhibitors like 
endostatin might be given at a relatively early stage of disease, 
just as cholesterol-lowering statins are now used to keep blood 
vessels healthy. The blood vessel stimulators would be reserved for 
relieving arteries that are already badly clogged. 
</P>
<P>
	At EntreMed Inc. in Rockville, Md., which is developing  
endostatin, spokeswoman Mary P. Sundeed said the company is 
concentrating on the cancer uses of the drug and has no plans to 
test it against heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
	She said initial safety testing of endostatin in cancer patients  
should begin this summer at the University of Wisconsin and M.D. 
Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.

	Clinton Reiterates Kosovo Stance  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today reaffirmed his  
commitment to assist Kosovo refugees and vowed to continue the 
campaign against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic ``until we 
prevail.'' Clinton spoke to a group of private humanitarian relief 
leaders and federal officials at the White House. Meanwhile at the 
Pentagon, spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the U.S. military has for 
the first time obtained satellite images that ``indicate atrocities 
have taken place'' by Serb troops against ethnic Albanians. The 
images show ``armored personnel carriers and tanks appearing to 
herd groups of people into a smaller area,'' Bacon said, although 
there's no evidence about what happened to the people.

	Libya Delivers Pan Am Bomb Suspects

	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- Libya today handed over two  
suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, 
Scotland, triggering suspension of sanctions that isolated Libya 
from the West. The surrender of alleged former intelligence agents 
Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah means the two 
men can be tried in the Netherlands under Scottish law on charges 
of planting the suitcase bomb that blew up Pan Am Flight 103, 
killing 270 people. The United Nations had imposed sanctions on 
Libya in 1992 and 1993 for its refusal to turn over the suspects.

could have ended with the death penalty. Russell Henderson, 21, 
pleaded guilty to felony murder and kidnapping. He could get two 
life sentences. Authorities said Henderson and Aaron McKinney, 21, 
posed as homosexuals and lured Shepard out of a bar last October, 
kidnapped and pistol-whipped him and left him tied to a fence in

skies over Yugoslavia, hit bridges, fuel depots and army barracks, 
taking aim at Serb forces accused of pushing ethnic Albanians out

<HEADLINE> Japanese Shoe Retailer Goes Under </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Hit by slumping sales, Americaya, a major Japanese  
shoe retailer, was declared bankrupt Monday with liabilities 
totaling 22.3 billion yen ($184 million), a credit research agency 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tokyo District Court accepted an application for protection  
from creditors filed by Americaya, which has been in business for 
74 years, said Konoshin Taira, a researcher at Tokyo Shoko Research 
Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	Taira said Americaya's sales had dwindled over the past several  
years due to the sluggish sales and competition with other 
retailers offering much lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
	A failure in the company's stock investment during Japan's  
easy-credit ``bubble economy'' during the late 1980s also had hurt 
Americaya's financial portfolios, Taira said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tokyo-based Americaya, set up in 1925, has about 100 shops  
throughout Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Japanese companies are struggling to stay afloat amid the  
country's worst recession since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	In a quarterly report, the Bank of Japan said Monday that  
business sentiment at Japanese companies improved slightly during 
the past three months.

<HEADLINE> Report Cites China-Clinton Donation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A prominent Democratic fund-raiser claims  
there was a direct link between the head of China's military 
intelligence and illicit financial contributions that allegedly 
went to President Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign, the Los 
Angeles Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Ji Shengde, the head of Chinese military intelligence, sent  
$300,000 in campaign donations to Johnny Chung, a Democratic 
fund-raiser in Southern California, The Times reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a portion of the money reached Democratic coffers, the  
newspaper said, citing sources familiar with Chung's sealed 
statements to federal prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	It is illegal for U.S. political parties or candidates to accept  
contributions from foreign sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung, a Taiwanese-born businessman who is now a U.S. citizen,  
donated nearly $400,000 to Democratic candidates and causes from 
1994 to 1996, but the money was returned after questions arose 
about its legality. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung admitted making nearly $30,000 in illegal contributions to  
Democrats including $20,000 to the Clinton-Gore re-election 
campaign. In December, he was sentenced to five years probation and 
3,000 hours of community service as part of a plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung and Ji were brought together by Liu Chaoying, who was a  
Chung business partner as well as a lieutenant colonel in the 
People's Liberation Army, The Times said. Liu did not respond 
Friday to questions sent by The Times to her office in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	In their first meeting in August 1996, Chung said, he declined  
Ji's money but the general said he was already engaged in similar 
transactions with others serving as conduits for Chinese funds to 
support Clinton's re-election. 
</P>
<P>
	Within a few days, Liu deposited $300,000 into Chung's Hong Kong  
bank account, telling him it was from Ji, sources told the 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal election records show that five weeks after receiving  
the money, Chung donated $35,000 in three checks to the Democratic 
National Committee. The remaining funds went to one of Chung's 
California bank accounts but it is not known how that money was 
used. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic party ``was unaware of any supposed  
relationship'' between Chung and the Chinese government at the time 
of the contributions, said DNC spokesman Rick Hess. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung declined to speak with the newspaper, saying he has  
``already told the whole truth to the grand jury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for China's embassy in Washington, D.C., denied any  
involvement in the 1996 elections. ``All these allegations about 
so-called Chinese government officials' political contributions 
into U.S. campaigns are sheer fabrications,'' said Yu Shuning.

<HEADLINE> Fireworks Explosion Was Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OSSEO, Mich. (AP) -- The explosion that killed five people at a  
fireworks factory last week has been classified as accidental, 
though the investigation is ongoing, fire officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The March 29 explosion at Independence Professional Fireworks  
Co. near Osseo could have been caused by something as simple as 
static electricity, said Sgt. Ken Hersha of the Michigan State 
Police fire division. 
</P>
<P>
	Hersha said the sweep of the door as owner Robert Slayton  
entered the building might have been enough to ignite the 
explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like he was just walking in the door, and that's why  
he was able to stagger 300 feet away on fire,'' Hersha said. 
</P>
<P>
	Slayton died from burns over 85 percent of his body. Slayton's  
wife, Patricia, and three employees died of carbon-monoxide 
poisoning inside the building. 
</P>
<P>
	The deadly blast followed a December explosion that killed seven  
people at the factory. 
</P>
<P>
	Although fire officials have said that blast was accidental,  
they said specifics for both are still under investigation.

<HEADLINE> Guard Marci Glenney Leaving UConn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STORRS, Conn. (AP) -- Sophomore point guard Marci Glenney has  
decided she doesn't have a future at Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	Glenney, a former Connecticut player of the year at Norwich Free  
Academy, confirmed reports Monday that she is leaving UConn. 
</P>
<P>
	``My parents and I sat down and re-evaluated my situation here  
and decided that the most important thing for me was to enjoy my 
experience,'' she said in a statement released by the university. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Geno Auriemma said he was disappointed but not surprised.  
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is that Marci and her family felt she would  
get a better chance to play, to be more productive, somewhere 
else,'' he told The Hartford Courant. 
</P>
<P>
	Glenney assumed a starting role at point guard for UConn late in  
the season, following injuries to freshmen Sue Bird and Keirsten 
Walters. 
</P>
<P>
	She finished the season averaging 4.3 points and 1.8 assists per  
game and started all three games in the Big East Tournament, 
helping the Huskies to their sixth straight championship. 
</P>
<P>
	She also started all three games in the NCAA post-season  
tournament, in which the Huskies made it to the Sweet 16 before 
losing to Iowa State. 
</P>
<P>
	Glenney's 3-pointer at the end of the Iowa State game in the  
regional semifinals were UConn's last points of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	NCAA transfer rules mandate, in most cases, that  
student-athletes sit out one academic year. Should Glenney transfer 
to another Big East Conference school, she would have to sit out 
two years.

<HEADLINE> Hall of Famer Early Wynn Dies at 79 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Hall of Fame pitcher Early Wynn, a 300-game  
winner and one of the fiercest competitors of his time, has died in 
Florida at an assisted living center. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	Wynn died Sunday night, his business manger, Dave Baudouin, said  
today. 
</P>
<P>
	He had suffered a heart attack and a stroke in recent years, his  
daughter, Sherry Van Tilburg of Venice, Fla., told The Plain 
Dealer. There was no was phone listing for Van Tilburg in Venice. 
</P>
<P>
	Wynn pitched from 1939 to 1963, winning 20 games or more for the  
Cleveland Indians four times and once for the Chicago White Sox in 
the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 23-11 in 1954, when the Indians won the American League  
pennant with 111 wins in a 154-game season. In 1959, he won the Cy 
Young Award for the pennant-winning White Sox, posting a 22-10 
record at age 39. 
</P>
<P>
	Wynn was also a good hitter, with 17 career home runs and a  
batting average one season of .319. Managers would use him as a 
pinch hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	At age 43, he returned to the Indians in 1963, needing one more  
win to reach 300. He reached the milestone July 13, 1963, pitching 
the first five innings of a 5-4 Indians victory in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	After he retired, Wynn was a pitching coach for the Indians and  
Minnesota Twins. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	Wynn's wife of 50 years, Lorraine, died in 1994. Wynn is  
survived by his daughter and son, Joe Early Wynn, also of Venice, a 
half-sister and three grandchildren. Funeral arrangements are being 
determined.

<HEADLINE> Lawless Talks About Lesbian Fans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Xena and Seven of Nine are two completely  
different television characters on two completely different shows. 
But they apparently share a common fan base: lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucy Lawless, who plays the title character on ``Xena, Princess  
Warrior,'' says lesbians gave the show its initial buzz. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lesbians were our first fans, especially the lesbian  
community in New York City. They really gave Xena a groove,'' 
Lawless tells the April 10 edition of TV Guide. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeri Ryan, who plays the half-human, half-Borg Seven of Nine on  
``Star Trek: Voyager,'' says there was a petition drive on the 
Internet to turn Seven into a lesbian. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then somebody issues a fake press release announcing it was  
going to happen. Then all the fans got disappointed when it didn't. 
Well, not everyone. I don't know that mainstream America is ready 
for it. But who knows?''

<HEADLINE> Tugboat Co. Fined for Sea Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) -- A tugboat company has agreed to pay  
$600,000 to settle charges stemming from an accident that damaged 
sea grass and coral off the Florida Keys and left a scar 13 miles 
long. 
</P>
<P>
	Coastal Marine Towing, which has since gone out of business,  
reached the settlement Monday just before a federal civil trial 
began. The settlement leaves Great Lakes Dredge and Dock Co. as the 
remaining defendant. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought we were doing the right thing for everyone  
concerned,'' Coastal attorney Allan Kelley said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. and state officials say an important part of the ecosystem  
of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary died in 1993 when 
four tugboats hauling dredging equipment passed through. One boat 
ran aground, tearing up the bottom. A pipe being towed by another 
boat came loose and dragged along the bottom for 13 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	The sea grass beds are nurseries for many species of fish,  
including snapper, grouper and grunts. The area where the boat ran 
aground, about 45 miles east of Key West, still has not recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	The marine sanctuary was created in 1990 to protect 2,800 square  
nautical miles of water heavily used by fishermen and boaters. 
</P>
<P>
	Jon Mueller, an environmental attorney for the Justice  
Department, said the flotilla of four boats was a joint effort of 
Coastal and Great Lakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Great Lakes attorney John Keller said Coastal Marine owned the  
boats that caused the damage while Great Lakes owned the other two 
boats. ``We didn't do it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government is seeking about $1 million from Great  
Lakes. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, treasure hunter Mel Fisher's company and his son were  
fined nearly $590,000 and ordered to hand over treasure from a 
sunken Spanish galleon for damaging sea grass in the Keys. That 
case was the first violation of the Florida Keys sanctuary to go to 
trial.

<HEADLINE> China To Visit U.S for Trade Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- On the eve of Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji's  
visit, U.S. and Chinese trade officials intensified efforts Monday 
to strike a deal granting China its long-sought membership in the 
World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	But the administration insisted any agreement would have to meet  
demands by U.S. manufacturers and farmers for access to China's 
huge market as a way of shrinking America's record $57 billion 
trade deficit with China, second only to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Cassidy, America's top negotiator on Chinese trade  
issues, held day-long discussions over remaining disagreements with 
a delegation led by Long Yongtu, China's vice minister for trade. 
Some of the biggest sticking points include Chinese barriers to 
exports of American farm products, chemicals and operations by U.S. 
insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
	China has made a number of concessions in recent weeks in hopes  
of finally overcoming U.S. objections to its membership in the 
Geneva-based organization that sets the rules for world trade. 
</P>
<P>
	But the trade talks are coming at a time of serious strains in  
U.S.-Chinese relations over the issues of human rights and charges 
that China stole U.S. nuclear secrets during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu, the first Chinese premier to visit the United States in 15  
years, would like to capture a WTO agreement as the centerpiece of 
his trip, but the administration insisted Monday that it will not 
accept a bad package. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that rather than looking at a calendar, we're going  
to look at the details of a deal and we're not going to take 
anything but a good deal,'' presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart 
told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu was scheduled to arrive in Los Angeles on Tuesday for the  
start of a nine-day American trip that will include stops in 
Washington for meetings Thursday with Clinton as well as visits to 
Denver, Chicago, New York and Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with Wall Street Journal executives, distributed  
Monday, the Chinese premier accused President Clinton of caving in 
to Congress and changing the standards for China's entry into the 
WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	He told the newspaper that Chinese concessions had brought a WTO  
agreement within reach, but ``due to pressure from the U.S. 
Congress, the U.S. government has shown a change in attitude.'' He 
called Washington's new demands ``unreasonable'' and said China is 
not inclined to make further concessions. ``Make no mistake,'' he 
said. ``China is not begging for accession to the WTO.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside trade experts were split on whether the current strained  
state of U.S.-Chinese relations would put a WTO agreement out of 
reach. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Hufbauer, economist at the Institute for International  
Economics, a Washington think tank, said there were strong 
pressures within the administration to clinch a WTO agreement since 
Clinton's other trade initiatives are tied up in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``This may be the only thing that Clinton will be able to  
achieve on his trade agenda during the remainder of his time in 
office,'' Hufbauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Greg Mastel, an economist at the Economic Strategy  
Institute, said Congress won't go along with a WTO deal. ``A deal 
that was seen as a sell-out would be a big political problem for 
President Clinton,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mastel predicted that the best outcome China could expect would  
be a ``framework'' agreement -- a ``face saving move'' -- where both 
sides would spell out where agreements have been reached, points of 
differences still remaining and set a deadline for concluding the 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu's visit comes at a time when the United States is upset over  
a Communist Party-ordered crackdown on Chinese trying to form a 
democratic party and allegations of Chinese espionage at U.S. 
nuclear labs. For their part, the Chinese are upset with America's 
role in the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, which the Chinese have 
condemned as a dangerous attack on international security. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Lockhart stressed that America's ``important relationship  
with China'' requires regular high-level discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart refused comment on a published report that the chief of  
China's military intelligence secretly directed $300,000 to 
Clinton's re-election campaign in 1996. He said the allegations 
were ``the subject of an on-going investigation at the Justice 
Department.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Times said that former Democratic fund-raiser  
Johnny Chung had given an account of the $300,000 payment to 
federal investigators.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Pitchers Face Major Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan has had a hard time of it lately: recession,  
unemployment and sinking corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Now even Japanese pitchers in the major leagues are getting  
hammered. 
</P>
<P>
	Hideo Nomo has fallen from rookie stardom to a Chicago Cubs  
minor league team. Hideki Irabu was denigrated by New York Yankees 
owner and dropped from the five-man rotation last week after 
struggling in spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just can't be helped,'' said fishmonger Masao Nakagawa,  
standing over racks of dried squid in his Tokyo market stall. 
``There are good times, and then there are bad times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The demotions have disappointed Japanese fans who used to watch  
TV specials with delight when a few of their own made it to 
baseball's pinnacle. 
</P>
<P>
	``A cold season for Japanese big league pitchers,'' read a  
headline last week in the national Asahi newspaper. ``For Japanese 
pitchers, jumping to the majors is getting more remote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among Japanese major leaguers, perhaps no one's star has fallen  
as far and as fast as Nomo's. 
</P>
<P>
	The right-hander broke into the big leagues in May 1995 with the  
Los Angeles Dodgers and became an overnight sensation. He won the 
National League Rookie of the Year award and led the league with 
236 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Then it all seemed to fall apart. The Dodgers traded him to the  
New York Mets last year. The Mets gave up on him after he went 0-2 
with a 7.62 ERA this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he's with Chicago's Triple-A Iowa farm team, getting just a  
handful of starts to prove himself before the Cubs decide whether 
to add him to their roster or let him go. 
</P>
<P>
	The reversal of fortune has knocked him the radar screens of  
many Japanese fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't talk much about Nomo these days,'' said Ryuichi  
Matsuda, an 18-year-old college student. 
</P>
<P>
	Irabu, meanwhile, made it to the big time after the Yankees won  
a bidding war in 1997 and signed him to a four-year, $12 million 
contract. The pitcher was 13-9 with a 4.06 ERA last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But Irabu has had a tough spring, going 0-2 with an 8.38 ERA.  
Yankees owner George Steinbrenner called him a ``fat ... toad'' 
last week, complaining about Irabu's weight (252 pounds) and lack 
of hustle. Irabu has been dropped temporarily from the starting 
rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Yankees broke camp in Florida, Irabu asked to remain  
behind ``to think about many things.'' He has since rejoined the 
club and apologized to his teammates for his absence. 
</P>
<P>
	There are a handful of other Japanese pitchers in the majors.  
Masato Yoshii is hanging on as the Mets' fifth starter after 
signing a $5 million, two-year contract in November. Shigetoshi 
Hasegawa is a reliever with the Anaheim Angels. 
</P>
<P>
	Some in Japan point to the American baseball system as a factor  
in their players' downfalls. 
</P>
<P>
	Hiromitsu Ochiai, a former player with the Yomiuri Giants,  
criticizes the way in which the Mets got rid of Nomo, saying a 
Japanese team would never release a player right before the opening 
of a season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The difference is that in Japan, we focus on how to cultivate  
a player,'' he wrote for the Weekly Asahi magazine. ``In America, 
they just try to pick the best among the players they have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kenichi Ida, a 26-year-old worker in a vegetable store in Tokyo,  
suggested that Japanese too small to compete with the bigger 
American players. 
</P>
<P>
	``Japanese body power is different from Americans,'' he said,  
gobbling down an early lunch of rice and seaweed flakes outside his 
store. ``So it's harder for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anyway, he said, baseball is not really on people's minds much  
anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're more interested here in soccer,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Four Shot To Death in Mich. Eatery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Hanna Akrawi became worried when a security  
company called to say the alarm at her family's restaurant hadn't 
been set when the eatery closed. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time Mrs. Akrawi entered the Prestige Barbecue on Sunday  
morning, her 12-year-old son, her husband, his brother and a cook 
were dead. Each had been shot several times in the head. 
</P>
<P>
	The restaurant appeared to have been ransacked and money from  
Saturday's sales was missing by the time the bodies were found, 
police homicide Inspector William Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police identified the victims as restaurant owner Jamal Akrawi,  
49, his 12-year-old son Tommy, both of Oak Park; Akrawi's older 
brother, Abed Akrawi, who was visiting from Iraq; and cook Paul 
Scott, 19, a high school senior from Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said there were no signs of forced entry, and speculated  
that the killer or killers entered the restaurant about the time it 
closed at midnight Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice told the Detroit Free Press that police questioned several  
people Sunday. ``We're looking at all the ex-employees,'' he said. 
``We're going through them as fast as we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Nofar of Livonia, a cousin of Jamal Akrawi, said Jamal and  
Hanna Akrawi took turns working shifts at the restaurant, while 
Tommy sometimes worked the cash register. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the only way they could survive,'' he said. ``They're a  
very hardworking family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scott, the youngest of nine siblings, started cooking at  
Prestige last summer and wanted to study culinary arts after 
graduation, his relatives said. 
</P>
<P>
	One brother, Michael Smith, lives less than 100 yards from the  
restaurant and watched Sunday as police wrapped yellow crime scene 
tape around the business. Soon after, an officer approached him 
with the news. 
</P>

	``I didn't want to believe it,'' Smith said. ``It's not the type  
of thing you talk about. I was hoping he was at home and not at 
work.''

<HEADLINE> Longtime Rival Lawyers Square Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- Courtroom veterans Wyatt Skaggs and Cal  
Rerucha have faced each other many times, but never before with the 
national media looking on and a man's life at stake. 
</P>
<P>
	Skaggs is the defense attorney and Rerucha the prosecutor in the  
trial of Russell Henderson, who is charged with first-degree 
murder, kidnapping and aggravated robbery in the fatal beating Oct. 
6 of gay university student Matthew Shepard. 
</P>
<P>
	The violence of the crime -- Shepard died from massive skull  
fractures after he was tied to a fence and pistol-whipped -- and 
suspicion Shepard may have been targeted because he was gay have 
put the town and the lawyers in the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both are good trial attorneys,'' said prosecutor Jon Forwood.  
``There's no mismatch there. Each can handle himself quite well in 
court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fiercely competitive, the two can also bring out the worst in  
each other. 
</P>
<P>
	In the case of an accused rapist, Rerucha became incensed after  
Skaggs told the jury his client was good-looking and ``could have 
many, many women if he wanted to. ... Is this a type of guy who 
would commit a rape?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rerucha responded that serial killer Ted Bundy was also  
good-looking, a remark noted by the Wyoming Supreme Court on appeal 
but not deemed egregious enough to overturn the conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was almost as though Wyatt had invited it,'' said Ted  
Lauer, professor of law at the University of Wyoming. ``The level 
of aggression and debate between the two was so intense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Wyatt can be one of the meanest people in the whole world in  
court. Out of court he can be brusque, sharp and short,'' said 
Lauer. ``He doesn't mince words with anybody. If he doesn't like 
you, he'll tell you so to your face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both men are extremely private, refusing to hold news  
conferences and seldom offering interviews. Neither would comment 
to The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	In a rare public statement in December, Skaggs railed at  
Rerucha's decision to seek the death penalty against Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been other cases in this county that have been just  
as heinous or more heinous in which he has not requested the death 
penalty,'' he said. ``I think it's heavy-handed to say the least 
and somewhat politically motivated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lauer disagreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Cal is an extremely conscientious person,'' he said. ``He  
doesn't do anything without agonizing over it. I'm sure he agonized 
over the decision to seek the death penalty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A sign outside Skaggs' office refers to him as ``country  
lawyer,'' but prosecutors know better. He has become the top 
criminal defense attorney in the state public defender's office and 
often is assigned the toughest cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Skaggs grew up the son of a flying instructor in Cody, a town on  
the outskirts of Yellowstone National Park. He told The Cody 
Enterprise last October that he was ``a bit of a rebel'' while 
growing up. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe that's one reason he so strongly defends each of his  
clients, no matter the charge. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every person, no matter how poor or reprehensible, deserves  
the best representation possible,'' he said. ``That's something 
that was drilled into me by my parents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rerucha, former paperboy and son of a Laramie railroad worker,  
enjoyed early political success. He was elected student body 
president at the University of Wyoming and after law school, 
alternated between private practice and work as deputy county 
attorney. In 1986, he ran for prosecutor and won. Albany County 
voters have re-elected him three times. 
</P>
<P>
	The Shepard case is not the first time he has drawn national  
attention. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, he charged a pregnant woman with child abuse because  
she allegedly consumed high quantities of alcohol. A judge 
dismissed the case because Rerucha could not show any damage had 
occurred to the unborn child. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, both lawyers will take part in a hearing called by 2nd  
District Judge Jeffrey A. Donnell. The meeting has pushed back jury 
selection to Tuesday and opening statements from Tuesday to 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Security remained tight at the courthouse, where visitors had to  
weave around police tape to the only open entrance and pass through 
a metal detector. Police have been planning for demonstrations for 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to anticipate as best we can both for what we  
know is going to occur and for what we can anticipate is going to 
occur,'' said Laramie Police Cmdr. Dale Stalder.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Reiterates Kosovo Stance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The American-led NATO air campaign against  
Yugoslavia will continue ``unceasing and unrelenting'' until 
President Slobodan Milosevic reverses course in Kosovo, President 
Clinton said Monday as the alliance reported a quickened pace of 
airstrikes and the arrival of more firepower. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our plan is to persist until we prevail,'' Clinton said at the  
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Anticipating that Milosevic may soon declare his goals in Kosovo  
achieved and propose peace, the Clinton administration pointedly 
declared that it will not tolerate a Kosovo emptied of ethnic 
Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	``Milosevic may think he's finished'' at that point, Pentagon  
spokesman Kenneth Bacon said. ``We will not be finished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Previewing a planned bolstering of NATO's airpower, Defense  
Secretary William Cohen said U.S. Army Apache attack helicopters 
would target Serb military and police forces that are now ``open 
and vulnerable'' in Kosovo. The helicopters probably will not be 
ready for action for more than a week, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going after his tanks, his armored units, his artillery,  
those forces on the ground that are carrying out this horrific 
ethnic cleansing,'' Cohen said in an Associated Press interview. 
``They are going to be targeted now and taken out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R.-Ill., dated  
Sunday, Clinton said the Apaches and supporting forces would 
operate from Albania. ``The mission does not include any planned 
deployment of ground troops'' into Kosovo, Clinton said. The 
duration of the mission ``will depend on the course of events,'' he 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	In his remarks Monday at the White House, Clinton said Milosevic  
faced a choice of ending the violence against ethnic Albanians in 
Kosovo or watching NATO systematically diminish the Yugoslav 
leader's ability to impose his will on Kosovo and stay in power. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know we are up against a dictator who has shown time and  
again that he would rather rule over rubble than not rule at all, 
someone who recognizes no limits on his behavior except those 
imposed by others,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Mr. Milosevic does not do what is necessary, NATO will  
continue an air campaign. It will be undiminished, unceasing and 
unrelenting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even as it worked out plans for expanding U.S. military  
involvement in Kosovo, the administration was scrambling on the 
humanitarian front. It flew more emergency relief supplies to 
Albania and worked on plans for accommodating 20,000 Kosovar 
refugees, probably at the Guantanamo Naval Station in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen and other administration officials insisted that the  
decision to airlift refugees out of the Balkans was not meant to 
indicate NATO had given up its goal of reversing the forced exodus 
from Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a temporary arrangement designed to deal with an  
emergency problem; it's not designed to have permanent relocation 
of these refugees,'' said State Department spokesman James P. 
Rubin. He said the idea was to ``alleviate the bottleneck'' of 
hundreds of thousands of refugees in Albania and Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had received a  
report on the plight of the ethnic Albanians inside Kosovo from 
David Sheffer, the U.S. ambassador-at-large for war crimes. Based 
on interviews he conducted with refugees, Sheffer concluded that 
Albanians are being driven from Kosovo not by NATO bombing but by a 
systematic expulsion by Serb military and police forces, Rubin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheffer reported that Pristina, the Kosovar capital, is being  
expunged neighborhood by neighborhood with seemingly calculated 
efficiencies. He said Kosovars are shaken down for their cash, 
money and jewelry, and those who resist expulsion are killed by 
gunfire or by torching their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The use of Apache helicopters, subject to final approval by NATO  
political authorities and by President Clinton, would mark an 
important turning point in the allies' war in Yugoslavia. The 
higher-flying NATO jets used so far have been unable to make a dent 
in the Serb armed forces operating in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are now open and vulnerable to this kind of an attack,''  
Cohen said. ``The Apaches are a very capable aircraft that will go 
in low and start to target them individually. It has a good deal of 
firepower and is going to represent an enormous challenge to the 
forces in opposition. He's going to be paying a high penalty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Apaches, used heavily against Iraqi forces in the 1991 Gulf War,  
are armed with laser-guided anti-tank missiles. Their crews are 
trained to fly low to the ground, either day or night, and in most 
kinds of weather. 
</P>
<P>
	In Kosovo, the Apaches would face a considerable threat from a  
variety of Serb air defense weapons, including shoulder-fired guns 
and anti-aircraft artillery. To suppress that threat, the Army 
plans to deploy multiple launch rocket systems to Albania armed 
with long-range missiles that can hit air defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	As NATO presses ahead with its bombing under clearing skies in  
Yugoslavia, officials at U.S. European Command in Germany began 
assembling Task Force Hawk, which will have 24 Apache helicopters, 
plus a variety of support forces, including 26 UH-60 Blackhawk and 
CH-47 Chinook helicopters, for cargo lifting and medical 
evacuation. The Army force would involve about 2,600 soldiers, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO officials were expected to give their formal OK to the use  
of Apaches, although the decision lay in Clinton's hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Cohen spokesman Kenneth Bacon said Sunday that the 24  
Apache attack helicopters offered to NATO could be in place in 
Albania in seven to 10 days, Army officials speaking privately said 
Monday it might take two weeks or longer to get the full contingent 
of about 2,600 soldiers in place. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Navy aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt and  
its battle group entered the Adriatic Sea on Monday. The carrier's 
contingent of F/A-18 Hornet and other strike aircraft are expected 
to begin flying missions on Tuesday. The battle group includes 
three ships and one submarine armed with Tomahawk cruise missiles, 
which have been a key weapon in NATO's air campaign.

<HEADLINE> White House Holds Easter Egg Roll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Moms wearing pink bunny ears, toddlers bundled  
against a chilly breeze and dads toting movie cameras streamed to 
the White House today for the 121st annual Easter egg roll. 
</P>
<P>
	President and Mrs. Clinton greeted thousands of people gathered  
on the South Lawn, which was still damp from a morning drizzle. 
Sharing the stage with three adult-sized bunnies, the president 
asked the crowd to pray for troops and refugees in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the president blew a whistle to start the festivities.  
</P>
<P>
	``Are you ready?'' Clinton asked children waiting to begin  
rolling eggs. ``All right. On your mark, ready, set go!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Using white plastic spoons, the children propelled hard-boiled  
eggs along the lawn to a finish line. For their effort, they got a 
plastic egg filled with candy and other gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House Easter egg roll has a century-old tradition. In  
the late 1870s, Congress scrapped its own Easter Monday event after 
deciding that the Capitol lawn should not be used as a children's 
playground, according to historian William Seale. The event was 
moved to the White House where it's been held every year except 
during World War I and World War II.

<HEADLINE> Clemens To Make N.Y. Yankees Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Roger Clemens against Gil Heredia. That's  
almost as much of a mismatch as, say, the New York Yankees against 
the Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens, the five-time Cy Young Award winner, makes his debut in  
a Yankees uniform tonight as the defending World Series champions 
open their season against Heredia, a journeyman with a 22-24 career 
record, and the lowly A's. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will be very special -- especially since I'm with a  
new club and a new bunch of guys who are going to be behind me. 
I'll have to channel my emotions early and make them work for me,'' 
Clemens said. ``I'm not nervous, but I get excited about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heredia, who became the A's opening day starter only because  
staff ace Kenny Rogers is recovering from a stiff elbow, pitched 7 
2-3 scoreless innings in a win over the Yankees in New York last 
September and said he's trying to ignore the comparisons with 
Clemens -- who has 233 career victories. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really haven't even thought about Rogers Clemens vs.  
Heredia. I can't even put them in perspective,'' the A's 
right-hander said. ``I'm just taking it as far as me against the 
Yankees. Roger has nothing to do with my performance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens, who won his last 15 games in 1998 en route to his  
unanimous selection as Cy Young Award winner for the Toronto Blue 
Jays, was traded to the Yankees in mid-February for pitchers David 
Wells and Graeme Lloyd and second baseman Homer Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something when you're facing the best team in baseball  
and the best pitcher in baseball over the last 10 years,'' A's 
designated hitter Matt Stairs said. ``There will be a lot of 
adrenalin, we'll just be trying to keep our emotions down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because he'll be wearing the Yankees' road grays, he won't start  
in the famed pinstripes until Saturday at home against Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees interim manager Don Zimmer, taking over while Joe Torre  
recovers from prostate cancer surgery, said he doesn't expect 
Clemens to be affected by the attention he'll receive in his first 
start in a Yankees uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a five-time Cy Young winner, so it's just another day at  
work for him. And that's the way he works every day, anyhow,'' 
Zimmer said. ``You go in the clubhouse and you've got to look in 
nine places to find him. But wherever he's at, he'll be working and 
doing something. There aren't too many pitchers who can keep up 
with the conditioning that Roger Clemens goes through every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees are coming off a tumultuous spring that included the  
Clemens trade, Torre's diagnosis with prostate cancer and Darryl 
Strawberry's battle to come back from cancer surgery late last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Another twist was added in recent days when owner George  
Steinbrenner called Hideki Irabu a ``fat ... toad'' and decided to 
leave the pitcher behind when the team broke training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	But after Zimmer penciled in Ramiro Mendoza instead of Irabu for  
the start Wednesday at Oakland in the Yankees' third game of the 
season, Steinbrenner announced he was hoping Irabu would start that 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the manager, I try to do what's right for the ballclub. My  
mind is not going to be changed by anybody,'' Zimmer replied 
Saturday night in Los Angeles. ``George Steinbrenner has been good 
to me, but, to me, you can't sit back here and be a little wimp.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irabu rejoined the Yankees on Sunday and apologized for his  
absence. Zimmer, meanwhile, reiterated that Mendoza would start 
Wednesday and that Irabu would be in the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked to the boss (Steinbrenner) this morning, and he said  
he didn't mandate that anyone start,'' general manager Brian 
Cashman said. ``This isn't as big as it's been made. There was 
certainly a bump in the road the last few days, there's no 
question. We've dealt with bigger things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It has been a much quieter spring for the Athletics, who  
finished last in the AL West the past two seasons and likely will 
end up there again this year. They look forward to the challenge of 
starting their season against a team that won a record 125 games 
last season and added a future Hall of Famer as its No. 1 starter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know they're the best team in baseball, and we can find out  
where we measure up real quickly,'' A's manager Art Howe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakland first baseman Jason Giambi knows tonight's game will  
take on even greater importance because of Clemens' debut with the 
Yankees, and just hopes the A's are catching the defending 
champions at a good time. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the best time to face them,'' he said, ``before they  
get rolling.''

<HEADLINE> Court Rules on Shellfish Harvesting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) -- In a big victory for Washington state's  
Indian tribes, the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday left intact a 
ruling affirming their right to gather shellfish from privately 
owned beaches. 
</P>
<P>
	The court rejected without comment an appeal of a lower-court  
ruling that said the 17 tribes' shellfish-gathering rights are 
guaranteed under 19th-century treaties. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once again, the Supreme Court has made it clear that the  
tribes' treaty-reserved rights to natural resources in western 
Washington are as valid today as the day the treaties were 
signed,'' said Billy Frank Jr., an elder in the Nisqually Tribe. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials, shellfish growers and private property owners  
had challenged the lower-court decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbara Lindsay, a spokeswoman for some of the thousands of  
property owners affected, said: ``We're just stunned that this 
could happen in America, that our property rights and our privacy 
rights could be trampled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Commercial shellfish growers contend the ruling could threaten  
their livelihoods because the Indians will be able to gather 
naturally occurring shellfish even from cultivated areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribal leaders said Monday's court action does not mean Indians  
will be indiscriminately tramping private beaches to dig clams, 
mussels and other shellfish. Among other things, tribal members 
will be permitted to harvest on private property only five days a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a long process before you can go on a beach and  
harvest,'' said Doug Williams, a spokesman for the Northwest Indian 
Fisheries Commission. ``There must be a biological assessment of 
the area, sampling and testing, and a written notice. In fact, as 
far as I know, there has been only one harvest off of a private 
landowner's beach'' since the 1994 ruling on tribal shellfish 
rights by a federal judge in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Ms. Lindsay said, in the end ``we will have people on our  
beaches, invading our privacy'' to dig for shellfish. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people bought these properties, they had no idea there  
were treaty rights to shellfish,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under treaties signed in 1855, the tribes gave up most of their  
land in then-Washington Territory in exchange for reservations, 
money and the right to continue fishing in traditional fishing 
grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	A series of court rulings during the 1970s defined what areas  
are traditional Indian fishing grounds, and affirmed the tribes' 
right to take up to half of the salmon and other fish. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, U.S. District Edward Rafeedie said shellfish are  
covered, too.

<HEADLINE> A New Era of Stock Pricing / Commentary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *AP Business Analyst    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In this, the ninth year of economic expansion,  
the stock market's ``.com'' mania seems only to intensify, 
propelling some Internet and technology shares into the 
stratosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	The mania is based in the belief that Internet and some  
technology stocks can't be measured the old-fashioned way, that is, 
on the basis of earnings. Get with it, reader; this is a new era. 
</P>
<P>
	In the new era, profits don't count as they once did. In fact,  
in notable instances they seem not to count at all. Amazon.com's 
price rose tenfold last year in the total absence of profits. 
</P>
<P>
	What does count is the willingness, even eagerness, of buyers to  
put a higher price on corporate shares, especially if they have a 
.com in their names or Internet positions for their companies. 
</P>
<P>
	This is new-era pricing, and it has more to do with price  
momentum and expectations than with such measurements as earnings 
growth, dividends and maturity of management. 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Michael Flament calculates that between 1945 and 1982,  
stocks produced a total return of 9.6 percent a year, thanks to a 
4.7 percent dividend income rise and 7.5 percent earnings growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Add those two factors together and you come to 12.2 percent, but  
from that you must subtract a 2.6 percent decline in price-earnings 
ratios to produce the net of 9.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Compare that with the annual rates of growth since then. From  
1982 to 1999, the total return from stocks has been 20.4 percent a 
year, or more than twice that of the 1945-1982 period. 
</P>
<P>
	New-era pricing produced that result. While both dividend income  
and earnings growth accounted for only 3.8 percent and 6.3 percent, 
respectively, price-earnings ratios soared 10.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Since P-E ratios indicate the number of times earnings that  
investors are willing to pay for a corporate share, it suggests 
that investors believe as never before in the future of stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	In such behavior, some critics see a corollary.  
</P>
<P>
	Commenting on market conditions, analyst Charles Allmon recalls  
a passage from ``Security Analysis -- Principles and Techniques,'' 
a stock valuation classic written by Benjamin Graham. 
</P>
<P>
	Allmon refers to it in an article for Better Investing, a  
monthly magazine of the National Association of Investment Clubs, 
but it may have pertinence for others. 
</P>
<P>
	Describing the mood of the 1920s, Graham wrote that ``making  
money in the stock market was now the easiest thing in the world. 
It was only necessary to buy 'good' stocks, regardless of price, 
and then let nature take her upward course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The results of such a doctrine, said Graham, ``could not fail to  
be tragic. Countless people asked themselves, 'Why work for a 
living when a fortune can be made in Wall Street without 
working?''' 
</P>
<P>
	The answer came in the crash of 1929. ``Human nature never  
changes,'' said Allmon. Graham might have agreed.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stock Prices Close Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's main stock index closed higher today after  
the central bank announced a rise in corporate sentiment, but sharp 
early gains were wiped out by profit-taking. The dollar gained 
against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average climbed 44.59  
points, or 0.27 percent, to finish the day at 16,334.78 points. On 
Friday, the average closed down 37.37 points, or 0.23 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.36 yen in late afternoon trading, up 0.70  
yen from late Friday in Tokyo and also above its late New York 
level of 120.55 yen on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In its closely-watched quarterly ``tankan'' survey, the Bank of

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends At Record 10,007.33 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology issues propelled the stock market  
sharply higher today, lifting the Dow Jones industrial average back 
above 10,000, as investors stopped worrying about interest rates 
and looked forward to strong first-quarter earnings reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue chip index closed up 174.82 at 10,007.33, just  
squeezing past the Dow's previous closing high of 10,006.78, set 
March 29. Monday's session was just the second time that the Dow 
has finished above 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite index and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index  
also set new records. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq rose 66.69 to 2,560.06, passing its previous high  
close of 2,510.09, reached Feb. 1. The S&AMP;P 500 rose 27.40 to 
1,321.12, exceeding its closing high of 1,316.55 set March 18. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a herd instinct out there, as everyone wants to buy the  
winners,'' said David Orr, chief economist at First Union Capital 
Markets in Charlotte, N.C. ``This is not economics; it's 
psychological.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Traders were buoyed by Friday's Labor Department report that  
just 46,000 new jobs were created in February, the smallest 
increase in three years. The report calmed investor fears that the 
economy was growing too fast and that the Federal Reserve might 
raise interest rates to slow it down. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts said the rally exceeded their expectations from the  
jobs report. Monday was the first chance the market, which was 
closed for Good Friday, had to react to the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing wrong with the economy, but is the economy  
that good? The answer is probably no,'' Orr said. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks once again set the tone for trading.  
</P>
<P>
	Among Dow stocks, IBM was up 6 5/8 to 183 5/8 and Hewlett-Packard rose  
3 9/16 to 71 7/16. America Online rose 16 3/4 to 166 3/4 on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Nasdaq, Yahoo! shot up 39 5/16 to 219 1/16 as traders  
anticipated a strong earnings report from the Internet company on 
Wednesday. Computer maker Dell was up 2 13/16 at 44, Sun 
Microsystems gained 3 3/4 at 129 15/16, and Microsoft was up 2 1/4 at 94 
15/164. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online declined to comment Monday on a published report  
that revived rumors AOL, the No. 1 Internet services company, was 
in talks to buy CBS. The takeover talk was the subject of a report 
Monday in the online edition of the San Jose Mercury News. AOL was 
up 16 15/16 at 166 15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Online trading companies also traded higher after a Credit  
Suisse First Boston analyst issued positive comments about the 
sector. E-Trade Group rose 11 3/4 to 72 5/8 Charles Schwab rose 9 1/8 to 
103 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue chip stocks also rose amid optimism about first-quarter  
earnings reports that will be released starting this week. That 
included oil companies -- Exxon was up 2 1/16 to 72 3/16 and Chevron 
rose 3 13/16 to 90 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	``Expectations are very solid for the larger companies,'' said  
Richard Cripps, chief market strategist for Legg Mason of 
Baltimore. ``Microsoft, GE and these types of companies will show 
robust double-digit growth in sales and earnings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Online bookseller Amazon.com rose 15 1/2 to 186 1/2 and retailer  
Wal-Mart gained 2 1/8 to 95 3/8. The two companies settled a suit brought 
by Wal-Mart charging that Amazon hired computer system managers 
away from Wal-Mart to steal the retailer's trade secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin on the  
NYSE with 1,689 up, 1,321 down and 558 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 694.4 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 701.1  
million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 9.64 to 614.63, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 9.94 to 721.24 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 3.55 to 402.29.

<HEADLINE> Case Raises Online Privacy Concerns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- It must have seemed like a perfectly anonymous  
place to gripe about work: an Internet message board where 
employees could hide behind code names as they complained about 
such topics as the company's stock price and its chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	But Raytheon Co. said the workers were also divulging company  
secrets by discussing such matters as rumored mergers and 
acquisitions, impending divestitures and possible defense 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Raytheon got subpoenas forcing Yahoo! Inc., the forum operator,  
to help pierce the anonymity the workers thought they enjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! says it always complies with valid court orders, and now  
two workers have reportedly resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	Privacy advocates said Monday the case is a clear illustration  
about how fragile anonymity is on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Raytheon earlier this year sued a total of 21 people for  
discussing corporate business on the forum, one of many sites on 
the Internet that offer places to talk about specific companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Some, if not all, of the defendants are Raytheon employees,  
although their identities aren't all known. 
</P>
<P>
	Topics they discussed included the company's stock price and  
gripes about the chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Chatters used aliases like ``Rayman-mass'' and  
``RaytheonVeteran'' -- names they may have thought would protect 
their true identities. 
</P>
<P>
	When Raytheon filed the suit in February, it had only those  
online handles. But armed with the subpoena, it went knocking on 
Yahoo!'s doors. 
</P>
<P>
	Diane Hunt, a Yahoo! spokeswoman wouldn't say exactly how the  
company responded to the court orders, but she did say the company 
``attempts to comply with validly issued subpoenas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunt said people who use Yahoo! services should be aware that  
while it won't sell or give away users' information, court orders 
are more serious. 
</P>
<P>
	``We notify the members in advance,'' Hunt said. ``In the  
message board terms and conditions, we make it clear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Globe reported Monday that two of the lawsuit's  
targets had left the company, apparently as a result of Raytheon's 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Raytheon spokesman David Polk would not comment on the report,  
nor would he say whether the company would terminate employees 
found to have divulged information on the forum. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to release information as it pertains to  
employees,'' Polk said. ``Each of these cases will be looked at on 
an individual basis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The situation troubles Marc Rotenberg, director of the  
Electronic Privacy Information Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``Companies should not disclose such information, even in  
response to a subpoena without some due process,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rotenberg said he would like to see Internet companies more  
aggressively fight subpoenas requesting information on users. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is personal information that is being held in trust.  
There's a real privacy issue there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	An America Online spokesman confirmed that his company had also  
received a court order commanding it to provide information on the 
Raytheon chatters. Although the substance of the order couldn't be 
immediately confirmed, AOL is the most popular provider of Internet 
accounts, so some of the chatters could have their names registered 
with AOL. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL has a policy similar to Yahoo!'s, but Rich D'Amato said  
whenever AOL receives such a subpoena in a civil case, it always 
notifies the member, giving the person 14 days to try to quash the 
subpoena. Only after that time has expired will the company turn 
over the information. 
</P>
<P>
	The Globe also reported that Microsoft had also been hit with a  
Raytheon subpoena. A message left Monday for a Microsoft spokesman 
was not immediately returned.

<HEADLINE> Ameritech Sells Cellular Units </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Ameritech Corp., looking for federal regulators  
to bless its planned merger with SBC Communications, is selling 
nearly half of its cellular interests to GTE Corp., the phone 
company that's seeking to merge with Bell Atlantic Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The $3.3 billion deal is the latest move in an industry scramble  
of acquisitions and alliances aimed at luring corporate customers -- 
the most profitable portion of the telecommunications market -- with 
national and global networks that offer a wide array of calling, 
Internet and media services. 
</P>
<P>
	``SBC-Ameritech and Bell Atlantic-GTE are gathering assets to  
compete with the AT&AMP;T's and MCI Worldcom's of the world,'' A.G. 
Edwards analyst Joseph Eshoo said Monday. ``It's coming down to 
four large international telecom carriers who will be competing 
aggressively for the best customers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced Monday would make a combined Bell  
Atlantic-GTE the biggest U.S. wireless carrier with 13 million 
subscribers, including 1.7 million Ameritech customers in the 
Chicago and St. Louis areas and northwest Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	While the addition of those areas would give Bell Atlantic-GTE a  
presence in two-thirds of the largest U.S. markets, AT&AMP;T and Sprint 
PCS would remain the only carriers that currently offer nationwide 
cellular service. 
</P>
<P>
	Ameritech said the sale of the cellular properties is contingent  
upon gaining regulatory clearance for its acquisition by SBC. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department recently gave the green light to that  
deal with the condition that the two Baby Bells sell off wireless 
properties in areas where they have overlapping operations that 
would dominate the market. 
</P>
<P>
	But last week, the government's top telecommunications regulator  
said he has ``serious concerns'' about the deal, which would create 
the nation's largest local phone company. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Communications Commission Chairman Bill Kennard sent  
letters to SBC and Ameritech on Thursday asking to hold talks this 
month to explore ``whether it would be possible to craft 
conditions'' addressing his concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	The properties being sold to GTE will be operated by Georgetown  
Partners, a minority-owned firm that will own a 7 percent stake in 
the acquired businesses, which will keep the Ameritech name for an 
undisclosed period of time. Some 1,700 Ameritech employees would be 
transferred to GTE. 
</P>
<P>
	``This sale demonstrates that the SBC-Ameritech merger will  
bring substantial new competition into the Midwest (and) broaden 
the ownership of these properties to include greater diversity from 
the community,'' Ameritech chief executive Richard Notebaert said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago-based Ameritech and San Antonio-based SBC announced  
their intent to merge last May. The proposed stock swap, now worth 
more than $60 billion, has the approval of shareholders from both 
companies, as well as the support of key unions. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal also must be cleared by the Illinois Commerce  
Commission and the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Ameritech rose $2.37 1/2 to $62.62 1/2 in trading on the New  
York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Russian Crisis Pushes US Firms Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Dunkin' Donuts has taken its Boston Cremes back to  
Boston. Pizza Hut, unable to capture a large slice of the Russian 
market, has closed its Moscow restaurants. And Ben and Jerry's ice 
cream operation melted away on the rocky road of Russian 
capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of America's best known brands streamed into Russia during  
the early 1990s, drawn to one of the world's largest untapped 
markets. But Russia's notoriously difficult business climate 
combined with last year's financial blowout has sent dozens 
packing, and prompted others to lay off staff and scale back 
expansion plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The worst case scenarios of what could have happened in a  
long, cold Russian winter have not played themselves out,'' said 
Scott Blacklin, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in 
Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	``But if we get to the summer and there is no significant  
improvement, then I think we could see deeper disillusionment, 
which could lead to a serious bleeding of the American presence,'' 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans are by far the largest foreign investors in  
Russia, with more than 500 U.S. firms operating here. Their 
activity peaked in 1996 and 1997 as Russia's financial markets 
soared and the economy hinted at growth after years of depression. 
</P>
<P>
	But since the economic crisis struck last August, about 50  
members of the American Chamber of Commerce have left the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial services were the hardest hit, and those leaving  
tended to be smaller firms. Larger companies that have already 
invested big sums in Russia are still trying to weather the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, the political climate has  
stabilized. Still, critics say the government still hasn't come up 
with a coherent plan to reverse the economic decline. 
</P>
<P>
	In a survey of Chamber of Commerce members, almost two-thirds  
said they have suffered ``significant losses'' due to the crisis 
and more than half said they have laid off workers. 
</P>
<P>
	American food franchises have been among the most high-profile  
entries into the Russian market, and their mixed fortunes 
demonstrate both the risk and potential of doing business in 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	When Dunkin' Donuts announced it's withdrawal earlier this  
month, it cited sales that swooned 50 percent after the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dunkin' Donuts, like Pizza Hut and Ben and Jerry's, had only  
a few outlets in Russia. Its departure was mostly symbolic and 
there is by no means a shortage of American fast food. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald's, for example, has 46 restaurants in Russia, and its  
Pushkin Square site in downtown Moscow remains the busiest 
McDonald's anywhere in the world, serving 20,000 customers a day. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald's business slumped about 5 percent to 10 percent  
immediately after the crisis, but it's been steadily returning, 
said Glen Steeves, the head of McDonald's in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've always taken the long-term view that this is going to be  
a tremendous market,'' said Steeves, though the crisis did lead the 
company to review its short-term plans. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald's opened 19 new restaurants last year, but only one so  
far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald's has invested more than $130 million in Russia, and  
purchases 75 percent of its supplies locally, including beef. That 
has protected it against the collapsing ruble, which has hammered 
American firms that must import their supplies in dollars, and sell 
their wares in rubles. 
</P>
<P>
	A Big Mac in Russia now costs the equivalent of $1.35,  
significantly less than in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	American enterprises run the gamut from oil companies to  
computer firms to law offices, and all face problems in a country 
with a shaky banking system, a choking bureaucracy and a Byzantine 
tax and legal system. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's software is a big hit in Russia -- but it's not  
nearly as popular as the pirated versions that sell at a fraction 
of the price. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Gates visited Russia and noted that according to official  
figures, Russians were scooping up computers in large numbers -- yet 
weren't purchasing the software needed to run them. 
</P>
<P>
	Why should they? The pirate market in Russia is so efficient  
that Windows 98 software was available at kiosks throughout Moscow 
days before it was formally launched in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, oil giants such as Mobil and Exxon have invested  
hundreds of millions of dollars to extract oil from some of the 
harshest landscapes in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	But that has proved child's play to the far more complex task of  
securing needed legislation from the Communist-dominated 
parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost all companies ran into trouble when Russian banks were  
gridlocked shortly after the August crisis. With no access to their 
cash, many businesses had to fly executives to London and other 
European capitals simply to pickup briefcases full of dollars, 
which they hand-carried back to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	While the overall climate remains difficult, a handful of U.S.  
companies have found a silver lining in the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Several of our competitors have been knocked out of the  
market,'' said Michael Adams, an investment officer with Global 
Partner Ventures, which converts military industries into private 
civilian companies. ``Our projects are getting more attention now 
than before.''

<HEADLINE> India's Government Nears Collapse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- A restive party in India's ruling  
coalition pushed the government a step closer to possible collapse 
Monday, declaring that it would withdraw from the Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
	Jayaram Jayalalitha, head of a party known by its Tamil acronym  
AIADMK, announced after a meeting of party leaders that the two 
government ministers from her party would resign Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The powerful south India politician said she would travel to New  
Delhi next week to explore the possibilities of forming a new 
government, Press Trust of India quoted her as saying in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Jayalalitha has hinted in the past that she would support a  
no-confidence vote against Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's 
wobbly coalition when parliament convenes April 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Vajpayee's one-year-old coalition is made up of 19 parties  
holding 276 seats in the 545-member lower house of parliament. A 
defection by Jayalalitha's 18 deputies could topple the government, 
but Vajpayee is banking on her enemies to cross over to the 
government and offset the loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Vajpayee has rejected Jayalalitha's demands that Defense  
Minister George Fernandes be dismissed or investigated for firing 
India's naval commander, Admiral Vishnu Bhagwat, in December. He 
has also refused her demands to reinstate Bhagwat. 
</P>
<P>
	The showdown over Fernandes is the latest dispute between the  
prime minister and Jayalalitha, the most fractious member of his 
coalition. In the past, he has placated her on several issues, 
including transferring officials probing corruption charges against 
her. 
</P>
<P>
	Jayalalitha, head of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra  
Kazhgam, embarrassed the prime minister by meeting Congress Party 
leader Sonia Gandhi in New Delhi last week in a flirtation with 
Vajpayee's chief opposition.

	COVINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Jacor Communications will pay $800,000 to  
buy WBZY-AM from WBZY Radio Sam of New Castle, Pa., the company 
said today. The purchase is subject to approval by the Federal 
Communications Commission. Including pending deals, Jacor owns, 
operates or represents 241 radio stations, plus WKRC-TV in 
Cincinnati. A subsidiary, Premiere Radio Networks, provides radio 
programming, including the talk shows by Rush Limbaugh, Dr. Laura

	Russia Expects IMF Deal Next Week

<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- A senior Cabinet official said today that he  
expects to reach a final agreement on new loans with the 
International Monetary Fund this week -- unless talks are marred by 
Russia's support for Yugoslavia. The IMF says its talks with Russia 
have nothing to do with politics, including Moscow's harsh 
criticism of NATO air raids against Yugoslavia. Prime Minister 
Yevgeny Primakov has also said that the issues are unrelated. 
Primakov and IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus agreed in 
principle last week that the fund would resume its lending to 
Russia, but details have yet to be worked out.

	Russian Crisis Pushes US Firms Out  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's notoriously difficult business climate  
combined with last year's financial blowout has sent dozens of 
American companies packing. Others are laying off staff and scaling 
back expansion plans. Many U.S. companies streamed into Russia 
during the early 1990s, drawn to one of the world's largest 
untapped markets. More than 500 U.S. firms operate in Russia. Since 
the economic crisis struck last August, about 50 members of the 
American Chamber of Commerce have left the country. They include 
Dunkin' Donuts, Pizza Hut and Ben and Jerry's.

managers away from Wal-Mart to steal the retailer's trade secrets. 
The suit, filed last fall, had charged that Amazon.com targeted the 
employees as well as Wal-Mart's software vendors to learn more 
about the retailer's information systems, which include data on 
sales, inventory and consumer buying habits. In the settlement 
announced today, Amazon.com agreed to reassign some of the former 
Wal-Mart employees to jobs that don't mirror the positions they 
held at Wal-Mart. Amazon.com also said it would return Wal-Mart 
information brought by the former employees.

Penney said the quarterly magazine, tentatively called ``Noise,'' 
would start with a circulation of 3.5 million. The first issue is 
due in July. The retailer has hired Redwood CMP to produce the 
magazine. The retailer said it will give ``Noise'' away at its 
1,150 stores across the country and consider a direct mail 
distribution in the future. The full-color magazine will focus on 
the latest teen beauty and fashion styles and trends as well as 
features on sports and music.

	Ameritech Sells Cellular Units  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Ameritech Corp. is selling its cellular business  
in three states to GTE Corp. for $3.27 billion to help satisfy 
federal stipulations for Ameritech's merger with SBC 
Communications. The sale of the businesses in the Chicago and St. 
Louis areas and northwestern Indiana is contingent upon regulatory 
approval of the SBC deal, Ameritech said today. The Justice 
Department recently gave the green light to that deal with the 
condition that the two Baby Bells sell off wireless properties in 
areas where they have overlapping operations that would dominate 
the market. But last week, the government's top telecommunications 
regulator said he has ``serious concerns'' about the deal, which 
would create the nation's largest local phone company.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Decisions In Brief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Supreme Court took the following actions Monday:  
</P>
<P>
	--Ruled that judges cannot impose stiffer punishments on criminal  
defendants who plead guilty but refuse at sentencing to give 
details about the crime. The 5-4 ruling in a Pennsylvania drug case 
said holding such defendants' silence against them would impose 
``an impermissible burden on the exercise of the constitutional 
right against compelled self-incrimination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Ruled that prosecutors don't violate lawyers' rights to  
practice their profession by having them searched and interfering 
with their ability to advise a client appearing before a grand 
jury. The unanimous decision said such a search in a California 
case, ``whether calculated to annoy or even to prevent consultation 
with a grand jury witness,'' did not violate a lawyer's 
constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
	--Refused to review a South Carolina judge's order that barred  
pretrial reporting on a secretly recorded conversation between a 
murder defendant and his lawyer. The justices turned down a 
Columbia, S.C., newspaper's arguments that the judge's 1997 ``prior 
restraint'' on publication was unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	--Said it will review the death sentence of convicted Virginia  
killer Terry Williams, whose scheduled Tuesday execution was 
postponed last week. The justices said they will decide whether 
Williams should get a federal court hearing on his claims that he 
was denied adequate legal help during his sentencing trial. 
</P>
<P>
	--Clarified the deadline for transferring cases from state court  
to federal court, saying the 30-day clock begins to run when 
someone is formally served and receives a copy of a lawsuit. Even 
though an Illinois company was faxed a copy of a lawsuit two weeks 
before it was formally served, the 30-day clock did not begin to 
run until formal service was completed, the justices' 6-3 ruling 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	--Refused to revive a Waco, Texas, television reporter's libel  
lawsuit over coverage of a federal raid on the Branch Davidian 
compound in 1993. John McLemore's lawsuit accused Dallas-Forth 
Worth station WFAA-TV of airing reports that implied McLemore had 
tipped the religious sect about the raid.

<HEADLINE> Richardson Staying at DePaul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Quentin Richardson turned to his inner circle for  
the most important advice of his young basketball career. His 
family told him they could get by without the big money he might 
earn in the NBA, and DePaul's freshman star decided to stay in 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	At least for one more year.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was basically a decision on whether I needed to be able to  
take care of my family. I asked them were we hurting that bad? My 
father, my sister and my step mom all said, `No, they would be 
fine, it could wait,''' Richardson said Monday at a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson's father, Lee, has worked as a motorman with the  
Chicago Transit Authority for 32 years. At age 56 he wasn't ready 
to retire and he wanted his 18-year-old son to work on his 
education. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have always told him I wanted him to stay in school,'' Lee  
Richardson said. ``He has always told me that he wanted me to 
retire, but I told him `Hey, I'll be all right.' If he left it up 
to me, I'd want him to do all four. All four years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's not likely to happen. Richardson was named Conference  
USA's player of the year and was chosen the nation's top freshman 
last season by the U.S. Basketball Writers Association, The 
Sporting News and Basketball News. He averaged 18.9 points and 10.5 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	DePaul coach Pat Kennedy and Richardson's sister, Rochelle,  
contacted several NBA general managers and coaches, seeking input 
and to gauge where might be taken if he declared for the pros. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson was projected as a middle to late first-round pick  
where he could probably get a salary of about $900,000. Most 
advised staying in school to work on his game and improve his draft 
positioning. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were some inconsistencies. They were all opinions and  
you also have to take into consideration his readiness level,'' 
Rochelle said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was not a good idea to let him get out and get locked into  
a contract and not get the time that would be advantageous to his 
future. All those things played out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Richardson, who will have an insurance policy for next  
season totaling several million dollars, said where he would have 
been drafted was not the point. His family was and had they needed 
the money, he would have taken off. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision process never reached that stage.  
</P>
<P>
	``Regardless of what they project you, there is still a lot of  
money sitting there, so you got to go ahead and take care of your 
family,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I would have been 100 percent sure I would have  
fared well (in the NBA). I couldn't say I wouldn't have been able 
to compete or do well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson, at 6-foot-5, played mostly small forward last season  
and will need to move his game to the perimeter as an off-guard, 
where he would probably play in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	The most disappointing aspect of his first season at DePaul was  
the Blue Demons' failure to make the NCAA tournament. Led by fellow 
freshmen and Chicago prep stars Bobby Simmons and Lance Williams, 
DePaul had to settle for the NIT where a first-round win over 
Northwestern was the school's first victory in the postseason since 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams was relieved to have his friend and teammate back for  
another season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was playing with me, telling me he was coming back and then  
telling me he was going. Now we have a chance to get a great 
team,'' Williams said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great statement for college basketball that Quentin is  
coming back,'' Kennedy added.

<HEADLINE> SLOC Addresses Homeless Concerns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The Salt Lake Organizing Committee's new  
president told a coalition of homeless advocates today he cannot 
promise housing that could benefit low-income resident will be left 
after the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitt Romney spoke with Salt Lake Impact 2002 and Beyond at the  
American Civil Liberties Union of Utah's downtown office. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the SLOC needs 22,000 rooms for 17 days during the  
Olympics and the committee is still about 5,000 rooms short. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not be building housing. We'll be hosting people for  
17 days and then they will be moving on,'' Romney said, adding that 
some hotels have offered rooms and the University of Utah has 
offered its dormitories. 
</P>
<P>
	``If somehow, magically, housing units would fall from the sky,  
we'd grab those too,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The coalition he met with represents more than a dozen groups  
involved with the state's poor, disabled and minority communities. 
</P>
<P>
	Those groups are concerned about a possible crackdown on the  
homeless during the games, similar to actions taken during the 1996 
Summer Olympics in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney agreed with the group, saying ``people of all different  
economic situations are living in our community and that's the way 
it should continue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said landlords should not expect to make extra cash by  
kicking out their tenants and renting homes or condominiums to 
visitors who might pay more during the games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not favor the idea of people being moved out of housing  
to bring in visitors from out of town,'' he said. ``How to address 
that, I don't know. I know that I can publicly say you're not 
making a good business decision.''

<HEADLINE> Stock Market Higher; Dow Up 170.62 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology issues propelled the stock market  
higher Monday, lifting the Dow Jones industrial average above 
10,000, as investors relaxed about interest rates and looked 
forward to robust first-quarter earnings reports. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow was up 170.62 at 10,002.62,  
trading just below its record high close of 10,006.78, set last 
Monday. The markets were closed on Good Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally also sent the Nasdaq composite index and the Standard  
&AMP; Poor's 500 index into record territory. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq was up 56.87 at 2,550.24, leaping above its high  
close of 2,510.09 reached Feb. 1. The S&AMP;P 500 rose 24.14 to 
1,317.86, slightly exceeding its closing high of 1,316.55 reached 
March 18. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a herd instinct out there, as everyone wants to buy the  
winners,'' said David Orr, chief economist at First Union Capital 
Markets in Charlotte, N.C. ``This is not economics; it's 
psychological.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Traders were buoyed by Friday's Labor Department report that  
just 46,000 new jobs were created in February, the smallest 
increase in three years. The report calmed investor fears that the 
economy was growing too fast and that the Federal Reserve might 
raise interest rates to slow it down. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts said today's market surge exceeded their  
expectations from the jobs report. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing wrong with the economy, but is the economy  
that good? The answer is probably no,'' Orr said. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks once again set the tone for trading.  
</P>
<P>
	Among Dow stocks, IBM was up 6 to 183 and Hewlett-Packard rose  
3 1/4 to 71 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! shot up 34 to 213 3/4 as traders anticipated a strong  
earnings report from the Internet company on Wednesday. Computer 
maker Dell was up 2 9/16 at 43 3/4, Sun Microsystems gained 3 29/32 at 
130 3/32, and Microsoft was up 2 19/64 at 94 63/64. 
</P>
<P>
	Online trading companies also traded higher after a Credit  
Suisse First Boston analyst issued positive comments about the 
sector. E-Trade Group rose 8 13/16 to 69 11/16 Charles Schwab rose 
6 1/2 to 100 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue chip stocks also rose amid optimism related to  
first-quarter earnings reports that will be released starting this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Expectations are very solid for the larger companies,'' said  
Richard Cripps, chief market strategist for Legg Mason of 
Baltimore. ``Microsoft, GE and these types of companies will show 
robust double digit growth in sales and earnings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 558.6 million shares, 
down from Thursday's 565.2 million.

<HEADLINE> Rising Raptors Turn Into Contenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Take one of the NBA's worst teams, add two tough  
old-timers and one scintillating rookie, flip into a new arena, 
then sizzle until red-hot. 
</P>
<P>
	That recipe has transformed the Toronto Raptors into a

</P>
<P>
	They are playing the first meaningful NBA games ever in Canada --  
and have won a franchise-record six straight, including 
down-to-the-buzzer victories over San Antonio and Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	After three-plus seasons housed in Toronto's cavernous SkyDome,  
the Raptors moved to the new Air Canada Centre on Feb. 21. Since 
then, they've gone 11-2 at home, and Raptors tickets are suddenly 
as coveted as NHL tickets for the playoff-bound Toronto Maple 
Leafs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a vendetta against the entire league because just  
about everybody has beat on us,'' reserve forward John Wallace 
said. ``Now, we're the team doing a little laughing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fans had modest hopes for this abbreviated season, suspecting a  
reprise of the 16-66 record in 1997-98. 
</P>
<P>
	But top draft choice Vince Carter has blossomed rapidly into a  
star, and is the clear favorite for rookie of the year. He leads 
the team in scoring with 17.6 points a game and dominates local 
sports-show highlights with his gyrations around the rim. 
</P>
<P>
	But Carter's brilliance alone wouldn't have gotten the Raptors  
where they are now, in seventh place in the Eastern Conference at 
18-14. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Oakley and Kevin Willis, two tested and tough big men,  
were acquired during the offseason, going from title contenders to 
the seemingly hapless Raptors. 
</P>
<P>
	They injected the team with the most crucial missing ingredient  
-- a strong work ethic, a willingness to wage trench warfare game 
after game, regardless of the score. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakley's statistics aren't glamorous, but he just might be more  
valuable to the Raptors than he ever was to the New York Knicks, 
inspiring gritty play from his mostly young teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	Willis, the former Houston Rocket in his 15th NBA season, has  
struggled with a shoulder injury the past month, but nonetheless 
has been the most solid center the Raptors have ever had. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's there for everybody,'' backup guard Dee Brown said.  
``Kevin lets everyone know when they do a good job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown has been vital to the offense with his 3-point shooting  
off the bench. Starting guard Doug Christie, the longest-serving 
Raptor, is the league leader in steals and No. 2 on the team in 
scoring with 14.7 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
	Butch Carter, in his first full season as a head coach, also has  
made effective use of Wallace and reserve swingman Tracy McGrady. 
Each is averaging more than eight points a game. 
</P>
<P>
	Vince Carter is the one who electrifies the crowds -- mixing  
3-pointers with twisting layups and emphatic dunks, seemingly 
gaining energy in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday night, his defense was pivotal in an 87-85 victory  
over Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Wizards star Mitch Richmond took an inbounds pass with 10  
seconds left and maneuvered for a winning or tying shot. 
</P>
<P>
	But Carter stayed with Richmond to prevent a drive, then leapt  
when Richmond tried a long shot, disrupting the release. The ball 
never hit the rim. 
</P>
<P>
	Willis put his arm around Carter after the game and walked him  
down the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knows his defense has to be there to be a well-rounded  
player,'' Willis said. ``I just wanted to make sure he knew. He 
knows what he can be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Sunday's home-court win over Philadelphia, Oakley was  
asked how it felt to be ahead of the Knicks in the standings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking down on a lot of teams,'' he said. ``We can't  
brag, or this or that. We've just got to play ball every night.''

<HEADLINE>  NATO Blasts Serb Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO blasted at Serb targets today  
that reportedly included an air force building, army barracks and 
the capital's airport, while the allies planned an airlift of 
ethnic Albanian refugees flooding out of Kosovo province. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid a heavy new wave of airstrikes late Sunday and early today  
across Serbia, the United States signaled an escalation of 
firepower to halt Serb attacks on Kosovo's Albanian majority. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington agreed to send 24 Apache helicopter gunships, 2,000  
troops and a missile launching system to Albania to give NATO the 
ability to directly attack Serb troops and tanks in Kosovo, a 
province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO leaders meeting today must approve use of the weapons.  
</P>
<P>
	Deploying Apaches and support troops in Albania would mark a  
substantial escalation of the NATO campaign. The low-flying 
helicopters would operate in hostile territory, with accompanying 
troops deployed close to the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	British Prime Minister Tony Blair renewed his pledge that  
Britain would not send troops in to fight a ground war. ``There is 
no question of NATO ground forces being sent in unless it is to 
police an agreed political settlement,'' Blair wrote in today's 
edition of The Sun, Britain's largest selling daily tabloid. 
</P>
<P>
	In Belgrade, air raid sirens sounded Sunday night to signal the  
onset of the 12th night of airstrikes, which lasted into the 
pre-dawn hours today, striking targets across Serbia, including 
Belgrade and Kosovo's provincial capital, Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	The independent Beta news agency reported a powerful explosion  
in the Belgrade area around midnight. More than 20 explosions 
during a half-hour span were heard around Pristina, where NATO 
planes later targeted an oil depot, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours later, NATO planes hit two suburbs of the capital --  
Rakovica to the south and Surcin to the northwest -- the Belgrade 
crisis center said. 
</P>
<P>
	A stone quarry was targeted in a populated area of Rakovica,  
while a missile struck near Belgrade's airport near Surcin, causing 
minor damage to the main terminal, the official Tanjug news agency 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Three powerful explosions early today also rocked Zemun, a  
northwestern district of the capital. Studio B radio said one of 
the targets was an air force command building. 
</P>
<P>
	In Obrenovac outside of Belgrade, Tanjug said a missile was  
downed and several explosions were heard early today. Explosions 
were also reported in the eastern Kosovo town Gnjilane. 
</P>
<P>
	One missile hit a bridge on the Ibar river, and a TV relay tower  
was also targeted, state media said. Both ends of a railway tunnel 
in the Ibar river valley were also targeted, effectively cutting 
the line. 
</P>
<P>
	Four explosions were heard today in the greater Nis area, 125  
miles south of Belgrade, Beta reported, three of which hit the 
command building of the Yugoslav Third Army. Another of the targets 
was later identified as a military barracks in the center of the 
city, Politika TV reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Three missiles hit an oil terminal a few miles from the town of  
Sombor, 90 miles northwest of Belgrade, Tanjug reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, state-run media said NATO planes targeted an army  
barracks in the town of Raska, about 100 miles south of Belgrade. 
Beta reported 11 men were injured, two seriously, when the barracks 
were hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanjug also reported that anti-aircraft fire was heard Sunday in  
Novi Sad, the nation's second-largest city, followed by an 
explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	The refugee crisis, meanwhile, was reaching epic proportions.  
Hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians have poured into 
neighboring states, bringing stories of terror and forced 
expulsions at the hands of Serbian troops and allied paramilitary 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
	The human tide has overwhelmed Albania, Macedonia and the  
Yugoslav republic of Montenegro. On Sunday, NATO announced plans by 
most of its member states to temporarily take in refugees to ease 
the pressure on the region. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest share was bound for Germany, which was to take  
40,000 refugees, and the United States, which agreed to take 
20,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Airlifts of some of the more than 100,000 refugees in Macedonia  
were to begin in earnest as soon as today. NATO was working to help 
with transport from other refugee-clogged areas, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO also agreed to use its nearly 12,000 troops now deployed in  
Macedonia in any way to assist in the humanitarian effort. Those 
troops were there to implement a Kosovo peace agreement that the 
ethnic Albanians signed but the Yugoslav government rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	The troops were building temporary refugee centers capable of  
sheltering 20,000 people and transporting food and water to border 
areas, NATO officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, in Podgorica, Montenegro, sources in the pro-Western  
government said a large column of Serbian military vehicles 
including tanks, trucks and other armored vehicles was seen Sunday 
moving south of Belgrade on a highway that would take it to either 
Montenegro or Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The report on the armored column moving southward comes amid  
fears Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic may be planning a 
military coup in Montenegro to oust his pro-Western foe, President 
Milo Djukanovic. 
</P>
<P>
	British military spokesman Doug Henderson told reporters Sunday  
the NATO attacks were ``cutting deep into the Serbian war 
machine.'' But Vladislav Jovanovic, the Yugoslav ambassador to the 
United Nations, maintained Belgrade's defiant stance toward the 
NATO campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``It only increases our resolve in defending our country,'' he  
said on the ``Fox News Sunday'' television program. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance launched air attacks on March 24 to try to force  
Milosevic to accept a peace plan for Kosovo that would include NATO 
peacekeeping troops on the ground.

<HEADLINE> E-Mail Flood Inconvenient for Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government wants to hear from you. Just  
don't send a lot of e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest demonstration of computer technology surpassing  
Washington's ability to cope with it, the U.S. Forest Service 
scrambled to adopt new rules about how taxpayers can send 
electronic messages to all its employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The government says it moved to prevent what could become a  
deluge of unwanted constituent e-mail, which can be sent with a 
single mouse-click to thousands of bureaucrats more easily and more 
quickly these days than a single letter can be hand-delivered by 
the Postal Service. 
</P>
<P>
	But the modern convenience of e-mail for citizens is proving  
inconvenient for the government, which is struggling to balance its 
obligations to listen to the nation's populace against its desire 
to get its work done. 
</P>
<P>
	The Forest Service changed its rules earlier this year after  
Andy Stahl of the activist Forest Service Employees for 
Environmental Ethics discovered a method to send e-mail messages to 
27,000 agency employees, a sort of high-tech handbilling. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, about 40 groups and individuals, sympathetic to forest  
industries, caught wind of the stunt by Stahl, a former agency 
employee. They asked for e-mail addresses for all 34,000 employees 
so they, too, could send messages -- an estimated 1.3 million 
e-mails in total. 
</P>
<P>
	``Would you please send me the e-mail list for Montana Forest  
Service employees?'' asked a writer in Montana. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand the U.S. Forest Service e-mail system is  
available,'' another wrote from Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Fearing the agency's computers might crash under the strain,  
Forest Service Chief Mike Dombeck decided to become a human filter 
for all the digital discourse. ``It could potentially grind it to a 
halt,'' said spokesman George Lennon. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agency's new policy, anyone who wants to get a message  
to all Forest Service employees will send it to Dombeck. If he 
decides the message is appropriate -- and he promises to be 
extremely lenient -- he will then post it on the agency's internal 
Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	The Forest Service's dilemma isn't unique. Congress, too, is  
looking at ways to restrict the flow of constituent e-mail. The 
home page for the House of Representatives offers a ``write your 
representative'' tool, but citizens can write only to a single 
congressman, not all at once. 
</P>
<P>
	During the impeachment debate, e-mails flooded Capitol Hill and  
strained computer systems. And in 1996, the Federal Communications 
Commission received 200,000 messages in less than a week when 
consumers mistakenly believed the agency might propose an Internet 
tax. 
</P>
<P>
	That barrage shut down the agency's e-mail system and public  
affairs computers. The FCC has since beefed up the system to 
prevent it from happening again. 
</P>
<P>
	Some experts said the Forest Service handled its dilemma wisely.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're paying our taxes and funding these agencies to get work  
done,'' said Ray Everett-Church of the Coalition Against 
Unsolicited Commercial E-mail. ``If they're listening to these 
diatribes, they're not going to be doing the people's business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paul McMasters, a First Amendment specialist at the Freedom  
Forum, a journalism research foundation, said the agency wasn't 
obligated to hand over its employee e-mail list. 
</P>
<P>
	``The potential for mischief is obviously great,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	McMasters said mass-mailing agency employees probably isn't  
worthwhile, anyway, because most key decisions are made by a few 
people at the top. 
</P>
<P>
	Stahl, the environmentalist, said he plans no more mass e-mails  
himself. But he supports anyone else who wants to send bulk 
messages. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's called democracy,'' he said. ``Communication should be  
free and open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And if all that freedom and openness wears thin?  
</P>
<P>
	``That's why you have a delete key.''

<HEADLINE> Vikings, George Agree To Terms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- The Minnesota Vikings, who were led  
to the NFC championship game last season by Randall Cunningham, are 
taking a chance on another quarterback with something to prove. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings announced Monday they have reached a contract  
agreement with Jeff George to serve as Cunningham's backup, giving 
George a chance to mend his reputation as a talented but 
temperamental passer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our sense of it was simply that when a player's in free agency  
it's a good time for reflection,'' Leigh Steinberg, George's agent, 
said Monday night. ``I try to focus a player on what values and 
priorities are good for them. ... In every way Minnesota was at the 
top of the list, except short-term economics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	George's one-year contract reportedly is worth $400,000 plus  
incentives, a mammoth slide from the $5 million-a-year deal he had 
as Oakland's starter the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Signing Jeff George is a big plus for our Viking program,''  
coach Dennis Green said. ``Jeff is a very talented quarterback with 
a competitive mentality. He has proved that he has the physical 
tools and the right mental makeup to be successful in the NFL.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings felt compelled to find a strong backup for  
Cunningham after they traded Brad Johnson to Washington in 
February. Johnson was the Vikings starter until injuries sidelined 
him for much of last season, giving Cunningham the chance to step 
in and lead the team's high-powered offense, which scored an 
NFL-record 541 points in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham had the best year of his career and, despite his age  
-- 36 -- the Vikings opted to keep him instead of Johnson, who said 
he wanted to start or be traded. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings will be George's fourth team. Indianapolis selected  
him as the top pick in the 1990 draft. He also played for Atlanta 
and Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	George led the AFC in passing with the Raiders in 1997, throwing  
for 3,917 yards with 29 TDs and nine interceptions. But he was 
injured part of last season and did not play well, and the Raiders 
opted out of his hefty contract during the offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, George got into a sideline shouting match with Atlanta  
coach June Jones on national television. That prompted the Falcons 
to release him. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg said his client should benefit from playing for a team  
with a chance to win the Super Bowl, rather than teams with little 
or no chance of making the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	George has played on only two winning teams during his eight  
seasons, finishing 9-7 with the Colts in 1992 and 9-7 with the 
Falcons in 1995, losing a first-round playoff game at Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``Indianapolis and Atlanta were rough situations,'' Steinberg  
said. ``Oakland was just a matter of where he played very well in 
1997 and got hurt in 1998. ... The only problem has been fitting 
into those two organizations (Indianapolis and Atlanta).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham signed as a backup two years ago after a one-year  
retirement. At the time, he was considered by some to be damaged 
goods. 
</P>
<P>
	``So many people have looked at Jeff like he's a bad guy or  
something, but they did the same thing to me two years ago,'' 
Cunningham said. ``So I know those things can sometimes be false. 
I'm sure it's not true what's been said of him.''

	In response to the burgeoning humanitarian crisis, NATO nations

States, 20,000; and Turkey, 20,000, NATO said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the border camp's outskirts, a long line of people stood  
listlessly, waiting to be chosen for the next bus going to an

who identified herself only as Lora. Tears in her eyes, she

said. Macedonian officials hoped to get an airlift under way today 
to ferry the refugees out of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Police and army troops banned the media from entering the camp

<P>
	``The situation has always been bad, but at least we are feeding

</P>
<P>
	Macedonia, a former Yugoslav republic, agreed to let refugees

go elsewhere. More than 120,000 have arrived so far. 
</P>
<P>

Yugoslavia, has taken in another 35,000 Kosovars fleeing Serb 
atrocities. Albania is coping with an influx of about 226,000.

<P>
	Fearing political and ethnic instability as a result of the  
refugees' arrival, Macedonia has said it can take in no more than 
20,000.

<HEADLINE> Wynette's Daughters File $50M Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Three of Tammy Wynette's daughters  
Monday filed a $50 million lawsuit blaming the country star's death 
on negligence by her husband and her doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	Daughters Tina Jones, Jackie Daly and Georgette Smith said Ms.  
Wynette died because Dr. Wallis Marsh of Pittsburgh did not monitor 
her condition closely and overprescribed medication. 
</P>
<P>
	They also said Ms. Wynette's fifth husband, George Richey, did  
not seek medical care for her after being urged to do so by Marsh 
on the day of her death. 
</P>
<P>
	Marsh ``inappropriately treated her in a number of different  
ways,'' said Ed Yarbrough, an attorney for the daughters. ``It 
became clear that her husband was very much a party to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Stand by Your Man'' singer died on April 6, 1998, at her  
Nashville home at age 55. Her body was found by Richey, and Marsh 
flew from Pittsburgh to sign the death certificate. He listed the 
cause of death as a blood clot in the lungs. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, Nashville's medical examiner denied a request by  
the three daughters to have Ms. Wynette's body exhumed and an 
autopsy performed, saying he was satisfied with Marsh's finding. 
</P>
<P>
	Telephone messages for Richey and his lawyer were not  
immediately returned. A call to Marsh's lawyers also was not 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Richey is not the father of any of the daughters. Ms. Wynette's  
fourth daughter, Gwen Nicholas, is not a party to the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Wynette had 20 No. 1 hits, including ``Stand by Your Man''  
and ``D-I-V-O-R-C-E.''

<HEADLINE> J.C. Penney To Start Teen Magazine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLANO, Texas (AP) -- J.C. Penney plans to publish a new magazine  
for teen-agers and distribute it for free in its stores. 
</P>
<P>
	J.C. Penney said the quarterly magazine, tentatively called  
``Noise,'' would start with a circulation of 3.5 million. The first 
issue is due in July. The retailer has hired Redwood CMP to produce 
the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	The first issue will be 84 pages and include 35 percent  
advertising, which will likely consist of J.C. Penney ads and those 
of the retailer's vendors. 
</P>
<P>
	The retailer said it will give ``Noise'' away at its 1,150  
stores across the country and consider a direct mail distribution 
in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see this magazine as a vehicle to create a strong, personal  
relationship with a very important customer -- teen-agers,'' said 
Gale Duff-Bloom, president of J.C. Penney Marketing and 
Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	The full-color magazine will focus on the latest teen beauty and  
fashion styles and trends as well as features on sports and music. 
</P>
<P>
	J.C. Penney would not disclose how much the magazine will cost  
to launch.

<HEADLINE> Back Pain Forces Ripken Out of Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Cal Ripken was removed from the Baltimore  
Orioles' game against Tampa Bay on Monday with stiffness in his 
lower back. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken voluntarily ended his record consecutive games streak at  
2,632 last September, so his removal for a pinch-hitter in the 
third inning Monday didn't have the possible repercussion it might 
have had a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Orioles third baseman has been a model of durability  
since his rookie season in 1982, when he began his remarkable 
streak. He played in pain for at least a portion of the 17-year 
run, although he almost had to sit down in 1997 because of lower 
back pain. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken gave no indication of experiencing any back problems this  
spring. He hit .200 but missed a huge chunk of the exhibition 
schedule to be with his ailing father, who died March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken appeared to run hard after putting down a sacrifice bunt  
in the second inning Monday. But when it came to take his next trip 
to the plate, he was replaced by Willis Otanez.

<HEADLINE> Mo. Prepares for Weapon Proposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Using pulpits and pickup trucks, activists in a  
statewide battle over the legalization of concealed guns campaigned 
hard in the final days before Missouri's voters decide its fate. 
</P>
<P>
	The pulpits Sunday included New Northside Baptist Church, a  
spiritual cornerstone in a mostly black St. Louis neighborhood that 
is occasionally rocked by gunfire and violent death. 
</P>
<P>
	``The myth that concealed weapons reduce crime is nonsense,''  
declared the Rev. William J. Ellis, who has led the church for more 
than a quarter of a century. 
</P>
<P>
	He urged his worshippers to reject Proposition B on Tuesday  
because ``that way, we won't have to get a metal detector for those 
entering the church house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The message was the same in a coordinated appeal to  
congregations -- with pastors criticizing Proposition B as 
loophole-ridden, unsafe and too risky for children. 
</P>
<P>
	If approved, anyone 21 or older may apply for a permit to carry  
a concealed firearm for a fee starting at $80. Twelve hours of 
training would be required. 
</P>
<P>
	Known alcohol or drug abuser and people with felony or  
misdemeanor firearms convictions or dishonorable military 
discharges would be ineligible for the permits. 
</P>
<P>
	Many worshippers at Easter ceremonies were quietly reverent but  
unswayed in their support for concealed guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve McCauley, who lives in an older section of St. Louis known  
as Dutchtown, said his 90-year-old neighbor ``is afraid of her 
shadow and won't let anybody in but the postman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So when his pastor at St. Anthony of Padua Catholic Church  
``asked us to consider voting against it'' during Sunday's sermon, 
McCauley quietly kept his support for Proposition B to himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he drove his pickup truck to the headquarters of  
Missourians Against Crime -- the leading support group for 
Proposition B and recipient of more than $3 million in 
contributions from the National Rifle Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a supporter because of crime. It's the right to protect  
yourself. I want everyone to have that choice, and I don't even own 
a gun or have any plans to seek a license if conceal-carry is 
approved. But we need this right,'' McCauley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of Proposition B, while enjoying a roughly 4-1 lead  
in fund raising on the strength of the NRA donations, nonetheless 
were apprehensive that their side of the story wasn't being told. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Jeffery, 40, insisted that his state-by-state research  
showed Proposition B's background checks and other provisions to be 
among the strongest of states with concealed guns laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``The history of this in other states shows that people act  
safely, responsibly and peaceably when conceal-carry is 
implemented,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Proposition B campaign may intensify today, as actor and NRA  
leader Charlton Heston appears in Springfield to rally support for 
the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the mayors of St. Louis, Kansas City and Columbia  
were linking up with Proposition B foes for campaign-ending news 
conferences in those cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides planned to congregate outside Busch Stadium to  
distribute literature to St. Louis Cardinals fans; the baseball 
club is officially on the record against Proposition B, amid 
concerns about hidden guns making sports turn deadly. 
</P>
<P>
	Back at New Northside Baptist Church, Jacqueline Gary, a  
worshipper with daughters ages 2 and 13, still had serious doubts 
about Proposition B. She plans to vote ``no.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My older daughter is transferring from St. Louis County  
schools to the city schools, and I am honestly terrified about what 
will happen if this passes,'' said Mrs. Gary, 35. 
</P>
<P>
	She reached down to smooth 2-year-old daughter Teniah's pink  
Easter dress as the wide-eyed child grinned at arriving 
churchgoers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is frightening when I think about my babies' safety,'' Mrs.  
Gary said. ``I do not believe in guns. But I might have to get one 
just to defend myself from the nuts if this passes.''

<HEADLINE> La. Town Wracked by Deadly Twister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BENTON, La. (AP) -- The muddy stack of possessions was sadly  
small -- a few wet snapshots, a crumpled blouse, a box of Christmas 
ornaments -- all the mementos James Dyal was able to find amid the 
crushed metal and wood where his mother died. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not much of anything left,'' Dyal said Monday as he  
rummaged through the debris left by a tornado that smashed Betty 
Dyal's trailer, killing her. ``I'd like to find some more pictures, 
some of her things that we could keep, but it's soaked and 
scattered all over the place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dyal, 60, was retired and lived alone in a trailer park.  
Her body was found lying near her Ford Fairmont, which was thrown 
into the middle of the mobile home lot, its roof crushed. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the six deaths in Saturday night's tornado occurred in  
the 66 trailers smashed by the storm at Hay Meadow Trailer Park. 
Block after block, the crushed wreckage was stacked in haphazard 
piles, blown into dangling power lines, draped over cars and 
trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighteen people remained hospitalized Monday; eight were in  
critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the misery, 4 to 6 inches of rain fell Sunday night,  
further soaking the remnants worth salvaging. 
</P>
<P>
	Families were allowed back into the park on Monday to pick  
through the rubble despite new tornado warnings and dark skies 
threatening more severe thunderstorms. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got a few clothes and a little paperwork we needed,'' said  
Joan Delise, 34, who worked with her right arm in a sling. She 
dislocated a shoulder and was badly bruised when the tornado 
shattered her trailer. ``But most of it's too buried to get to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Guard brought in front loaders, bulldozers,  
backhoes, dump trucks and troops to help with the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
	Sticky red mud sucked at workers' shoes. Grassy areas became  
mini-marshes. Glass, nails, splinters of wood, jagged fencing and 
razor-like pieces of metal made moving through the maze of wreckage 
dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
	``I keep longing for my house,'' said Mildred Pryor, 46, as she  
stood atop the wreckage of her trailer. ``I'm just homesick. I want 
somewhere where I can sit and relax, but I know that won't happen 
for a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Twin Point area where the other three deaths occurred,  
residents continued to pick through their broken trailers and 
houses. Workers also began removing broken trees downed by the 
storm. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no water, no lights, no gas,'' said Linda Jones, who  
was helping a friend recover the few things left at her smashed 
trailer. ``Not that there's anything to live in if there was. This 
is exactly what misery looks like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lynette Holyfield found little to take from her wrecked trailer  
at Hay Meadow. But her fiance, Scott Steudebaker, cheered her up 
when he found a 4-inch square pillow that Ms. Holyfield had 
cross-stitched for his Valentine's gift. Embroidered on it were the 
words ``I Love You'' and their names. 
</P>
<P>
	``He found it about five houses down,'' Ms. Holyfield said.  
``Now we're going to use it for a ring pillow at our wedding next 
month. Everyone says I shouldn't even wash the mud off it.''

<HEADLINE>  Lawmakers Mull Kosovo Ground Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The debate is growing over whether the Clinton  
administration can continue to foreclose the use of ground troops 
in Kosovo with the issue likely to dominate Congress when lawmakers 
return from their spring recess. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers from both parties said Sunday that President Clinton  
no longer should foreclose out of hand use of ground troops as a 
military option in Kosovo, but most emphasized that Congress should 
give its approval before troops actually are deployed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The diplomacy won't start until our president stops saying no  
ground troops,'' Sen. Dick Lugar, R-Ind., a senior member of the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said on ABC's ``This Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``To say no ground troops is a mistake'' Sen. Joseph Biden of  
Delaware, the committee's top Democrat, agreed on CNN's ``Late 
Edition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, administration officials said there are no plans to send  
ground forces into Kosovo, although the Pentagon announced Sunday 
it is sending 24 Apache helicopter gunships to neighboring Albania 
for use against Serbian troops in Kosovo. About 2,000 U.S. soldiers 
also will be sent to Albania to support the helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not believe an invasion force ... is in the national  
interest,'' Sandy Berger, the White House national security 
adviser, said on CBS' ``Face the Nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But a growing number of lawmakers of both parties are arguing  
categorically ruling out ground troops only plays into the hands of 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and keeps him from the 
negotiating table. 
</P>
<P>
	By ruling out such an option ``you immediately convince  
Milosevic that we're not really serious, that we're not ready to 
stay the course,'' Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va., said on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to hold open the option of using ground forces,'' Sen.  
Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., concurred on CBS. He said the attitude 
in Congress on ground troops has changed with the air war showing 
no early sign of capitulation by Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last week, there was no support for American or NATO ground  
forces. Next week, I think there may be because we understand more 
what's on the line here,'' Lieberman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The House returns from its Easter recess Tuesday, while the  
Senate is away until next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Democrats and Republicans said the use of ground troops  
should be debated in Congress and no troops should be committed in 
Kosovo without congressional approval. ``The Constitution requires 
Congress to make that decision,'' Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., said 
on ``Fox News Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a Vietnam War fighter pilot and  
POW, said it is time for Congress to ``become more engaged'' and 
debate a vote on the use of U.S. ground troops. ``We certainly have 
to make preparations for it,'' he told CBS. ``You never take any 
option off the table. ... It may well take ground forces to win,'' 
Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., agreed on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., said if ground forces are needed  
Clinton must make the case clearly on Capitol Hill. ``If he does 
... the Congress and the American people will follow,'' Shelby said 
on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	But other lawmakers rejected consideration of ground troops in  
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The air war should be intensified, Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo.,  
told CNN, but he added he couldn't ``conceive of a situation where 
we ... ought to be using ground troops.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., said on NBC that if invading troops  
are needed, ``those countries that are our allies that have 
strategic interests, let them take over the ground war.''

also will be sent to Albania to support the helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not believe an invasion force ... is in the national  
interest,'' Sandy Berger, the White House national security 
adviser, said on CBS' ``Face the Nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But a growing number of lawmakers of both parties are arguing  
categorically ruling out ground troops only plays into the hands of 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and keeps him from the 
negotiating table. 
</P>
<P>
	By ruling out such an option ``you immediately convince  
Milosevic that we're not really serious, that we're not ready to 
stay the course,'' Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va., said on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to hold open the option of using ground forces,'' Sen.  
Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., concurred on CBS. He said the attitude 
in Congress on ground troops has changed with the air war showing 
no early sign of capitulation by Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last week, there was no support for American or NATO ground  
forces. Next week, I think there may be because we understand more 
what's on the line here,'' Lieberman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The House returns from its Easter recess Tuesday, while the  
Senate is away until next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Democrats and Republicans said the use of ground troops  
should be debated in Congress and no troops should be committed in 
Kosovo without congressional approval. ``The Constitution requires 
Congress to make that decision,'' Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., said 
on ``Fox News Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a Vietnam War fighter pilot and  
POW, said it is time for Congress to ``become more engaged'' and 
debate a vote on the use of U.S. ground troops. ``We certainly have 
to make preparations for it,'' he told CBS. ``You never take any 
option off the table. ... It may well take ground forces to win,'' 
Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., agreed on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., said if ground forces are needed  
Clinton must make the case clearly on Capitol Hill. ``If he does 
... the Congress and the American people will follow,'' Shelby said 
on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	But other lawmakers rejected consideration of ground troops in  
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The air war should be intensified, Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo.,  
told CNN, but he added he couldn't ``conceive of a situation where 
we ... ought to be using ground troops.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., said on NBC that if invading troops  
are needed, ``those countries that are our allies that have 
strategic interests, let them take over the ground war.''

<HEADLINE> McGwire Causes ESPN Confusion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In an effort to show Mark McGwire's first game  
today, ESPN teased fans in New York by mistakenly showing a few 
innings of the marquee Dodgers-Diamondbacks game. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York area was supposed to see the Atlanta-Philadelphia  
game, but because of a communications mixup, fans got to see the 
first few innings of the Randy Johnson-Kevin Brown matchup. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe there was a mixup partially caused by the fact that  
we have a third network today,'' said ESPN spokeswoman Diane Lamb. 
``If we didn't add the network, New York viewers wouldn't be able 
to see the St. Louis game because the Yankees were a part of our 
tripleheader.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The third feed was put in place to allow fans in New York, the  
Bay Area, Los Angeles and Arizona to see McGwire. ESPN usually has 
one alternate feed for those areas unable to watch their home teams 
because of local broadcast rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees were involved in the third game of ESPN's  
tripleheader, playing at Oakland, so fans in the Bay Area and New 
York had to be on one of the alternate feeds. 
</P>
<P>
	The third feed was slated to start with the Braves-Phillies,  
then the Cardinals-Brewers and conclude with the White Sox-Mariners 
game.

<HEADLINE> Whitewater Figure Hale Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Whitewater figure David Hale was  
sentenced to 21 days in prison Monday for lying to state regulators 
about the solvency of his insurance company. With time off for good 
behavior, he could serve less than four days. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge David Bogard followed the jury's sentencing recommendation  
and turned down requests to let Hale serve his time in home 
detention. Hale's wife, Sue, had pleaded for mercy, recounting 
Hale's heart problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale was released on $10,000 bond while he appeals.  
</P>
<P>
	Hale pleaded guilty in the Whitewater case to two felonies and  
served 21 months of a 28-month sentence. He was a key witness 
against then-Gov. Jim Guy Tucker and James and Susan McDougal at 
their 1996 fraud trial. All three were convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale was convicted last month of making a false statement to  
regulators about the health of a burial insurance company he owned. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, Hale was directed to cover a $38,757 shortfall on the  
company books, but prosecutors say he ran a scam that temporarily 
addressed the problem. Hale claimed that regulators failed to 
recognize a legitimate business deal that netted the insurance 
company $150,000 in stock.

<HEADLINE> Tugboat Co. Fined for Sea Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) -- A tugboat company agreed Monday to pay  
$600,000 to settle charges stemming from an accident that damaged 
sea grass and coral off the Florida Keys and left a scar 13 miles 
long. 
</P>
<P>
	Coastal Marine Towing, which has since gone out of business,  
reached the settlement just before a federal civil trial began. The 
settlement leaves Great Lakes Dredge and Dock Co. as the remaining 
defendant. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought we were doing the right thing for everyone  
concerned,'' Coastal attorney Allan Kelley said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. and state officials say an important part of the ecosystem  
of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary died in 1993 when 
four tugboats hauling dredging equipment passed through. One boat 
ran aground, tearing up the bottom. A pipe being towed by another 
boat came loose and dragged along the bottom for 13 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Jon Mueller, an environmental attorney for the Justice  
Department, said the flotilla of four boats was a joint effort of 
Coastal and Great Lakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Great Lakes attorney John Keller said in his opening statement  
that Coastal Marine owned the boats that caused the damage while 
Great Lakes owned the other two boats. ``We didn't do it,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government is seeking about $1 million from Great  
Lakes. 
</P>
<P>
	The sea grass beds are nurseries for many species of fish,  
including snapper, grouper and grunts. The area where the boat ran 
aground, about 45 miles east of Key West, still has not recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	The marine sanctuary was created in 1990 to protect 2,800 square  
nautical miles of water heavily used by fishermen and boaters. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, treasure hunter Mel Fisher's company and his son were  
fined nearly $590,000 and ordered to hand over treasure from a 
sunken Spanish galleon for damaging sea grass in the Keys. That 
case was the first violation of the Florida Keys sanctuary to go to 
trial.

<HEADLINE> Court Rejects Jailhouse Talk Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today refused to review a  
South Carolina judge's order that barred pretrial reporting on a 
secretly recorded conversation between a murder defendant and his 
lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices, without comment, turned away a Columbia, S.C.,  
newspaper's arguments that the judge's 1997 ``prior restraint'' on 
publication was unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	The South Carolina Supreme Court upheld the judge's order last  
year, ruling by a 4-1 vote that it had been necessary and ``as 
narrowly tailored, both in scope and duration, as was possible 
under the circumstances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	B.J. Quattlebaum was facing trial, and a possible death penalty  
if convicted, for a murder committed during an armed robbery when 
in 1995 he and his lawyer talked about his case in a room at the 
Lexington County Sheriff's Department. They did not know their 
conversation was being videotaped. 
</P>
<P>
	When Quattlebaum's lawyers later learned that a copy of that  
tape had been leaked to Columbia television station WIS-TV, they 
sought a court order barring its dissemination. 
</P>
<P>
	State Judge Thomas Cooper ordered the station and all other news  
organizations, including The State newspaper, to refrain from 
reporting what the tape disclosed until jurors for Quattlebaum's 
trial had been selected and sequestered. 
</P>
<P>
	Quattlebaum subsequently was convicted and sentenced to death.  
He remains on South Carolina's death row. Although the judge's 
order long ago lost its legal force, the substance of Quattlebaum's 
secretly recorded discussion with his lawyer never has been made 
public. 
</P>
<P>
	A deputy sheriff has been indicted and charged with illegally  
taping what should have been a confidential conversation. The 
deputy, awaiting trial, has been suspended without pay. 
</P>
<P>
	In upholding the prior restraint on publication in Quattlebaum's  
case, the state Supreme Court said, ``It is difficult to conceive 
of a situation in which the rights of a defendant to a fair trial 
were more at jeopardy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state court's lone dissenter, Justice Jean Toal, said a less  
intrusive alternative might have preserved fair-trial rights. She 
noted a 1976 ruling in which the nation's highest court required 
that all possible alternatives be considered before courts bar the 
news media from publishing information they have. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for The State-Record Co.,  
which publishes The State, said there was no ``factual support'' 
for the 1995 prior restraint. The appeal also argued that the 
order's short duration made it no less a violation of the 
Constitution's free-press guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is The State-Record vs. Quattlebaum, 98-1035.

<HEADLINE> Case Dismissed Against Reno Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A judge dismissed a deportation case against  
a Palestinian accused of plotting to kill Attorney General Janet 
Reno, saying secret evidence against him was not convincing. 
</P>
<P>
	Hany Mahmoud Kiareldeen remained in federal custody Monday,  
however, after the Immigration and Naturalization Service obtained 
an emergency stay. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, U.S. Immigration Judge Daniel Meisner ordered  
Kiareldeen released on $1,500 bail. He also granted Kiareldeen 
conditional permanent residency, meaning he can remain in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Meisner wrote that the evidence does not support the  
government's claim that Kiareldeen ``has engaged in terrorist 
activity'' or ``that there exists a reason to believe he is likely 
to do so in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The stay was granted Friday by the U.S. Board of Immigration  
Appeals, which will consider his case. No date was immediately set 
for a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiareldeen was arrested by the INS in March 1998 and accused of  
overstaying his student visa, which was the only formal charge 
against him. He has maintained his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiareldeen has lived in New Jersey since he left the Gaza Strip  
in 1990. He managed an electronics store in Passaic and lived in 
Bloomfield with his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Summaries of secret FBI evidence given to the judge said  
Kiareldeen plotted to kill Reno because of her role in prosecuting 
the terrorists responsible for the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, 
that he was a suspected member of an unnamed terrorist 
organization, and that he made a threat against Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI never brought any charges against him.  
</P>
<P>
	Kiareldeen lawyers blamed the allegations on a ``disgruntled''  
ex-wife, Amal Mohamed. She testified against Kiareldeen last year, 
but refused to say whether she was the FBI source.

<HEADLINE> Galarraga Tosses First Pitch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Andres Galarraga, sitting out the season while  
being treated for back cancer, threw out the ceremonial first pitch 
before the Atlanta Braves' opener Monday against the Philadelphia 
Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga performed the ceremony from his home in West Palm  
Beach, Fla. Surrounded by two of his three daughters, Katherine and 
Andria, Galarraga tossed the ball toward a camera that was 
broadcasting live to the center-field video board at Turner Field 
in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie Perez, one of Galarraga's closest friends, crouched behind  
the plate, a ball already in his glove. After Galarraga threw, 
Perez emerged got up and displayed the ball to the cheering crowd 
as if it had traveled across two states. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am so excited and so sorry I cannot be there today,''  
Galarraga told the crowd in Atlanta. ``I wish the best luck for all 
the players, the Atlanta Braves, and thank all the fans for all the 
support you gave me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga was diagnosed with cancer shortly before the start of  
spring training. He will undergo six months of chemotherapy and 
radiation, and doctors are hopeful he will be able to return for 
the 2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Galarraga was the Braves' top hitter with a .305  
average, 44 homers and 121 RBIs.

<HEADLINE> Mixed Results for Baseball's Stars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	How baseball's big stars did Monday on opening day:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Mark McGwire. Hit home run No. 1, renewing his bid to make  
even more history. Coming off his record-breaking season of 70, he 
connected in the fifth inning for his 458th career homer in St. 
Louis' 10-8 loss to Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Ken Griffey Jr. Hit his seventh opening-day home run, one  
behind Frank Robinson's record, in an 8-2 loss to Chicago. The 
Seattle star did it at the Kingdome, soon after career homer king 
Hank Aaron threw out the first ball. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Roger Clemens. Made his debut for the World Series champion  
New York Yankees, staying in the game after an early rain delay at 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Albert Belle. Hit a three-run homer and an RBI single in his  
Baltimore debut, a 10-7 win over Tampa Bay. The crowd of 46,733 at 
Camden Yards gave him a standing ovation, and the surly slugger 
responded with a curtain call. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Cal Ripken. Forced to leave the Orioles' game in the third  
inning because of a stiff lower back and was listed as day-to-day. 
Last year, he voluntarily ended his record streak of 2,632 
consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Kevin Brown. Baseball's first $100 million man allowed three  
home runs in his Dodgers debut, but Los Angeles beat Arizona 8-6 in 
11 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Randy Johnson. The Big Unit struck out nine in his first game  
since signing a $52.4 million contract with Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Raul Mondesi. The top performance of the day -- hit a tying,  
three-run homer with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning, 
then hit a two-run homer in the 11th that lifted Los Angeles over 
Arizona 8-6. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Wade Boggs. Got two hits for Tampa Bay, moving him within 76  
of the 3,000 milestone. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Barry Bonds. Set an NL record with his 290th career  
intentional walk, breaking Hank Aaron's record in San Francisco's 
11-8 victory over Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Juan Gonzalez. Broke up Brian Moehler's no-hit bid by singling  
with one out in the seventh inning as Detroit defeated Texas 11-5. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Pedro Martinez. Struck out nine and was the winning pitcher as  
Boston beat Kansas City 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Tom Glavine. The NL Cy Young winner took the loss as Curt  
Schilling and the Philadelphia Phillies beat Atlanta 7-4. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Alex Fernandez. Pitching for the first time since wrecking his  
shoulder in the 1997 NL championship series, he led Florida over 
the New York Mets 6-2.

<HEADLINE> E-Mail Flood Inconvenient for Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government wants to hear from you. Just  
don't send a lot of e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest demonstration of computer technology surpassing  
Washington's ability to cope with it, the U.S. Forest Service 
scrambled to adopt new rules about how taxpayers can send 
electronic messages to all its employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The government says it moved to prevent what could become a  
deluge of unwanted constituent e-mail, which can be sent with a 
single mouse-click to thousands of bureaucrats more easily and more 
quickly these days than a single letter can be hand-delivered by 
the Postal Service. 
</P>
<P>
	But the modern convenience of e-mail for citizens is proving  
inconvenient for the government, which is struggling to balance its 
obligations to listen to the nation's populace against its desire 
to get its work done. 
</P>
<P>
	The Forest Service changed its rules earlier this year after  
Andy Stahl of the activist Forest Service Employees for 
Environmental Ethics discovered a method to send e-mail messages to 
27,000 agency employees, a sort of high-tech handbilling. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, about 40 groups and individuals, sympathetic to forest  
industries, caught wind of the stunt by Stahl, a former agency 
employee. They asked for e-mail addresses for all 34,000 employees 
so they, too, could send messages -- an estimated 1.3 million 
e-mails in total. 
</P>
<P>
	``Would you please send me the e-mail list for Montana Forest  
Service employees?'' asked a writer in Montana. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand the U.S. Forest Service e-mail system is  
available,'' another wrote from Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Fearing the agency's computers might crash under the strain,  
Forest Service Chief Mike Dombeck decided to become a human filter 
for all the digital discourse. ``It could potentially grind it to a 
halt,'' said spokesman George Lennon. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agency's new policy, anyone who wants to get a message  
to all Forest Service employees will send it to Dombeck. If he 
decides the message is appropriate -- and he promises to be 
extremely lenient -- he will then post it on the agency's internal 
Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	The Forest Service's dilemma isn't unique. Congress, too, is  
looking at ways to restrict the flow of constituent e-mail. The 
home page for the House of Representatives offers a ``write your 
representative'' tool, but citizens can write only to a single 
congressman, not all at once. 
</P>
<P>
	During the impeachment debate, e-mails flooded Capitol Hill and  
strained computer systems. And in 1996, the Federal Communications 
Commission received 200,000 messages in less than a week when 
consumers mistakenly believed the agency might propose an Internet 
tax. 
</P>
<P>
	That barrage shut down the agency's e-mail system and public  
affairs computers. The FCC has since beefed up the system to 
prevent it from happening again. 
</P>
<P>
	Some experts said the Forest Service handled its dilemma wisely.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're paying our taxes and funding these agencies to get work  
done,'' said Ray Everett-Church of the Coalition Against 
Unsolicited Commercial E-mail. ``If they're listening to these 
diatribes, they're not going to be doing the people's business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paul McMasters, a First Amendment specialist at the Freedom  
Forum, a journalism research foundation, said the agency wasn't 
obligated to hand over its employee e-mail list. 
</P>
<P>
	``The potential for mischief is obviously great,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	McMasters said mass-mailing agency employees probably isn't  
worthwhile, anyway, because most key decisions are made by a few 
people at the top. 
</P>
<P>
	Stahl, the environmentalist, said he plans no more mass e-mails  
himself. But he supports anyone else who wants to send bulk 
messages. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's called democracy,'' he said. ``Communication should be  
free and open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And if all that freedom and openness wears thin?  
</P>
<P>
	``That's why you have a delete key.''

<HEADLINE> Students Do Income Taxes for Fun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As the government's April 15th tax deadline  
looms, Yinel Lora is in great demand. Though just 21 and still in 
college, she has a talent sought by millions of Americans: She can 
do taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody wants to catch me before somebody else does,'' Ms.  
Lora says between clients. 
</P>
<P>
	The Baruch College accounting major is one of 72,000 people  
nationwide -- mostly students and retirees -- who give their time 
each year to the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Internal Revenue Service offers free help at local  
offices around the country, IRS employees say the volunteers 
provide an invaluable service by taking their calculators and tax 
guides to the places where people go -- to nearly 5,000 schools, 
malls and community centers. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS sponsors the program in conjunction with colleges and  
other organizations that set up the help sites. Participating 
schools range from tiny Jacksonville State University in 
Jacksonville, Ala., to the University of California at Los Angeles 
and New York University. 
</P>
<P>
	The students who participate get practical accounting  
experience, and the taxpayers, regardless of income, get their 
returns done for free. 
</P>
<P>
	What the students don't do, however, is strategize.  
</P>
<P>
	There's no talk of tax shelters or capital gains minimization.  
If anything gets tricky, the professors step in, and if it's too 
tricky for them, they refer people to professionals. 
</P>
<P>
	And if you get audited, forget it. The program's volunteers  
can't help. 
</P>
<P>
	Professor Richard Hendler, who served as a volunteer tax  
preparer in the 1980s and now oversees the volunteers at NYU, said 
he's never seen anyone get audited because the returns his students 
work on are pretty straightforward. 
</P>
<P>
	Taxpayer Rita Ritchie was pleased with the free help, and even  
more pleased when she learned she owed no taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're wonderful here. They're wonderful people,'' Ms.  
Ritchie said of the students at the Baruch program, adding that at 
her age -- she's in her 70s -- she's already paid enough taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	And while it may make some nervous to show their finances to a  
blue-jeaned, clunky-shoed college student, Ms. Ritchie said she was 
confident in her tax helper, Andrea White, noting that the 
23-year-old checked everything twice. 
</P>
<P>
	To qualify as volunteers, the students must take an IRS seminar.  
Then they must pass an exam asking them to prepare tax returns 
based for hypothetical clients and answer questions such as the 
following: 
</P>
<P>
	``Mark's uncle, Howard, has no income and lived with Mark all  
year in Tampa. Mark provided all of Howard's support. Howard is a 
U.S. citizen and single. Can Mark claim his Uncle Howard as a 
dependent?'' (Answer: Yes he can.) 
</P>
<P>
	Hendler, the NYU professor, said the program gives him ``a warm  
feeling'' -- words not typically associated with taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	People come to his students hesitant and anxious, toting their  
shoe boxes and shopping bags of receipts. The volunteers send them 
away reassured and sometimes awaiting a refund, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	No one seemed very concerned about the volunteers getting sued.  
</P>
<P>
	``Do I worry about it? No. Should I? I guess so,'' said Hendler.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. White, the Baruch volunteer, downplayed the risk because,  
``It's the IRS that really sponsors this program, that's how I look 
at it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her clients seem happy. Asked if she would return with her  
returns next year, Ms. Ritchie said, ``If I'm living, I'll come 
back.''

<HEADLINE> Giuliani: Mrs. Clinton Is Outsider </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- In February, New York City Mayor Rudolph  
Giuliani said he would not raise the ``carpetbagger'' issue against 
Hillary Rodham Clinton in their possible Senate race. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he has begun doing just that.  
</P>
<P>
	The strategy surfaced last week when the mayor's campaign  
committee unveiled its ``HillaryNo.com'' computer Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	``Born in Illinois and carried to power in Arkansas, with no  
connection of any kind to New York, Hillary has set her sights on 
the New York Senate seat,'' the Web site said. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after the Web site went public, Giuliani said: ``I didn't  
say I wouldn't raise it as an issue. What I said was that from my 
point of view that was not something critical.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, during an appearance Feb. 21 on CNN's ``Late Edition,''  
the mayor was asked about the ``carpetbagger'' issue and answered: 
``That's certainly not an issue that I would raise personally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Next year's race for the Senate seat being vacated by Democrat  
Daniel Patrick Moynihan could pit the Republican mayor against the 
first lady. Mrs. Clinton has not said whether she will run. 
Giuliani hasn't disclosed his intentions either. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Mayor Ed Koch, a Democrat, said Monday that Giuliani ``is  
like serpent with forked tongue'' for using the carpetbagger issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``One could argue that he is trying to scare her out'' of the  
race, said Harold Ickes, a top adviser to Mrs. Clinton. ``That's 
primarily the reason why you would go negative this early.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani defended his strategy shift last week, saying that  
people around the state kept mentioning Mrs. Clinton's lack of New 
York roots to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being the mayor of New York City and just listening to the  
views of New York City, I didn't quite understand a month, a month 
and a half ago, but this is a major issue,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if it was fair, he said: ``Come on, it's politics. She  
presents us with an opportunity and we take advantage of it and 
then that's not fair? I mean is it fair that she comes to New York 
and raises lots of money?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In terms of practical politics, this is an intelligent thing  
to do,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some independent polls have suggested Mrs. Clinton could be  
vulnerable to the carpetbagger attack. A statewide poll from early 
February found that 46 percent of registered voters surveyed said 
they would be less likely to vote for a non-New Yorker. Forty-nine 
percent said it would make no difference. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the carpetbagger issue has not stopped others. The  
Senate seat Mrs. Clinton and Giuliani are eyeing was won in 1964 by 
Robert Kennedy and in 1970 by the Conservative Party's James 
Buckley. Kennedy had been a Massachusetts resident. Buckley hailed 
from Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, during Kennedy's 1964 Senate campaign, a student wrote  
in his college newspaper that it was ``truly ridiculous'' that 
people might not support Kennedy because of the carpetbagger issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let us hope that cosmopolitan New Yorkers can rise above the  
ridiculous, timeworn provincial attitude that has so disunified our 
nation,'' Manhattan College student Rudolph Giuliani wrote.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Toughens Yugoslavia Stance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While offering Kosovo refugees temporary  
shelter, the Clinton administration is toughening terms for a 
settlement for Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, demanding 
that he go well beyond a simple peace offering for Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``A commitment to cease killing and a Kosovo denied its freedom  
and devoid of its people is not acceptable,'' President Clinton 
said Monday, declaring that NATO would prevail in an escalating 
battle with the Yugoslav leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton charted a course, backed by increased firepower, to  
expel Milosevic's forces from the Serbian province of Kosovo, 
return hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians to their homes and 
allow NATO troops in to ensure self-government for the Kosovars. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton promised an ``undiminished, unceasing and unrelenting''  
air campaign until Milosevic reverses a campaign that has forced 
NATO into the position of seeking to return hundreds of thousands 
of refugees to their homes rather than the original goal of keeping 
more from being pushed out. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright ticked off the U.S.  
demands in a speech Monday night honoring Gabrielle Kirk McDonald, 
who is president of the war crimes tribunal for Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright said Milosevic must pull military, police and  
paramilitary forces out of Kosovo, return all refugees to their 
homes, accept the deployment of an international security force in 
the province and create a democratic political framework in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Strongly hinting that Milosevic would be held accountable for  
war crimes, Albright said: ``There can be no question that war 
crimes and crimes against humanity are being committed in Kosovo. 
Nor can there be doubt that the orders to carry out these acts are 
coming from the top.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With an estimated 800 people an hour fleeing the Serbian  
province, which is part of Yugoslavia, the State Department now 
estimates close to 400,000 more ethnic Albanians have been routed, 
often by Serb troops -- or even Serb neighbors -- since the NATO 
attack began March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton called for private donations to Kosovar refugees and  
offered haven for up to 20,000 at the outset. Pentagon officials 
said a refugee camp likely would be set up at the U.S. base at 
Guantanamo, Cuba, which the United States considers U.S. territory 
and has been used to care for Haitian and Cuban refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Other NATO countries are offering to take in up to 80,000 more.  
</P>
<P>
	Moved by Milosevic's campaign from the original goal of simply  
stopping ethnic repression in Kosovo, the Clinton administration 
insists the Yugoslav leader will not be permitted to succeed; that 
the resettlement is only temporary and the refugees will go home 
again. Officials also deny the sustained NATO bombardment was 
having the unintended result of helping Milosevic achieve his goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Appealing directly to Americans to help the victims of  
Milosevic's ``expulsion policy,'' Clinton announced a toll-free 
number, 1-800-USAID-RELIEF, that people can call to donate money to 
nongovernmental relief efforts for ethnic Albanians expelled from 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're doing all we can, we need more help,'' Clinton said. He  
said $150 million in U.S. government funds has been committed to 
humanitarian relief in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Clinton had some of his harshest words yet for  
Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know we are up against a dictator who has shown time and  
again that he would rather rule over rubble than not rule at all, 
someone who recognizes no limits on his behavior except those 
imposed by others,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Pentagon, spokesman Kenneth Bacon echoed U.S. resistance  
to any hollow peace offering by the Yugoslav leader without a safe 
return of the refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	``Milosevic may think he's finished'' at that point, Bacon said  
of any unilateral cease-fire by Milosevic. ``We will not be 
finished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Previewing a planned bolstering of NATO's airpower, Defense  
Secretary William Cohen said U.S. Army Apache attack helicopters 
would target Serb military and police forces that are now ``open 
and vulnerable'' in Kosovo. The helicopters probably will not be 
ready for action for more than a week, however, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going after his tanks, his armored units, his artillery,  
those forces on the ground that are carrying out this horrific 
ethnic cleansing,'' Cohen said in an Associated Press interview. 
``They are going to be targeted now and taken out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the humanitarian front, Albright received a report on the  
exodus from David Sheffer, the U.S. ambassador-at-large for war 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on interviews he conducted with refugees in Macedonia,  
State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said Sheffer concluded 
that Albanians were being driven from Kosovo not by NATO bombing 
but by a systematic expulsion by Serb military and police forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheffer reported that Pristina, the Kosovar capital, is being  
expunged neighborhood by neighborhood with seemingly calculated 
efficiencies. He said Kosovars are shaken down for their cash, 
money and jewelry, and those who resist expulsion are killed by 
gunfire or by torching their homes.

<HEADLINE> Cleveland Opens Against Anaheim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- The Cleveland Indians seem star-crossed  
in the playoffs. The Anaheim Angels' luck tends to run out earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians, who have one of baseball's most powerful lineups,  
appear a lock to win their fifth straight title in the weak AL 
Central and raise anew the question of why Cleveland hasn't won a 
World Series in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	So even before spring training ended, manager Mike Hargrove was  
looking to the playoffs, saying that simply winning the division 
wasn't enough, and that 1999 was a ``put up or shut up'' year for 
the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	Their batting order is impressive, with speedsters Kenny Lofton,  
Omar Vizquel and Robbie Alomar at the top, followed by sluggers Jim 
Thome and Manny Ramirez, then farther down to David Justice, Wil 
Cordero and Sandy Alomar. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're the best team in their division again; there's no  
question about that. They've even improved with the addition of 
(Robbie) Alomar,'' said Tim Belcher, who was signed over the winter 
as a free agent and is the Angels' opening-day starter. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're a good test for us right off the bat, but that means  
we have to be ready. We need a fast start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jaret Wright (12-10), hit hard by the Angels the few times he's  
faced them, will start Tuesday night's opener at Edison Field. 
</P>
<P>
	He is 1-2 with a 10.70 career ERA against them, and last year  
was 0-2 with a 15.19 ERA, including an Aug. 3 start when he was 
hammered for seven runs in two innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't have good numbers in Anaheim,'' Hargrove said.  
``But he has only had a year and a half of numbers. That's skewed a 
little bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Angels, who have never played in the World Series and  
haven't been in the playoffs since 1986, are similar to the 
Indians. Anaheim also has a lot of punch, especially with the 
addition of free agent Mo Vaughn to a lineup that includes Darin 
Erstad, Tim Salmon, Jim Edmonds and Garret Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	But Anaheim, like Cleveland, doesn't have an particularly  
imposing pitching rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Angels are expected to fight it out with Texas in the AL  
West, one of the few divisions where there is no clear favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	Runnerup in the West three of the past four seasons, Anaheim has  
been hit by injuries to key players in recent years, especially in 
the spring and down the stretch of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	They begin this season without shortstop Gary DiSarcina, out  
with a broken forearm sustained early in spring training when he 
was struck by a fungo bat. DiSarcina isn't expected back until 
after the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
	The Angels also lost Jason Dickson, who was fighting for the  
fifth spot in the rotation, to a shoulder injury this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	At least for a while, Anaheim also will be without center  
fielder Edmonds, placed on the DL with a strained groin and sore 
right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Vaughn said, ``There's no reason for us not to feel  
positive about the kind of ballclub we have or the situation we're 
in. We just need to go play our game, finish first and, hopefully, 
keep it going in the playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Belcher (14-14) gets the Angels' start, his third opening-day  
assignment, the same way he got the other two -- because the team's 
No. 1 starter wasn't able to pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, Chuck Finley was bothered by back spasms this spring,  
delaying his pitching program, so Belcher was tabbed to face the 
Indians in the first of a three-game series. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an honor, but it's the third time and three times it has  
pretty much been by default,'' said Belcher, who noted he has drawn 
the assignment for three different teams. 
</P>
<P>
	He filled for the Dodgers' Orel Hershiser in 1989 after  
Hershiser had an appendectomy late in spring training. Last year, 
Belcher got the start for Kansas City because Kevin Appier wasn't 
ready to go. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited about it. It's going to be fun. I think your first  
start of the year is always special, and it doesn't matter whether 
it comes on opening day or not,'' Belcher said.

<HEADLINE> Profits for Fortune 500 Firms Dip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Internet companies may dominate the news these  
days, but they have a ways to go to be a factor in the Fortune 500. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortune magazine's annual ranking of publicly traded U.S.  
companies according to revenue was topped for the 11th straight 
year by General Motors, which took in $161.3 billion in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the Internet companies, America Online came closest to  
making the list, coming in at No. 535 with $2.6 billion in revenue. 
The company that ranked No. 500, container maker Ball Corp., had 
nearly $2.9 billion in revenue, according to the list released 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	While the stock prices of Internet darlings such as auctioneer  
eBay and retailer Amazon.com have given them market capitalizations 
surpassing many Fortune 500 firms, they have yet to generate 
significant revenues, let alone profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Fortune said 1998 would likely mark the beginning of the  
end of the dominance of blue chips such as General Motors and 
Coca-Cola. Younger high-tech companies such as Microsoft, Cisco 
Systems and Dell, with their surging revenues, are wielding more 
influence in corporate America. 
</P>
<P>
	``(1998) will probably be considered a watershed year, the year  
when the New Economy fundamentally parted ways with the old and 
high-tech consolidated its role as the driving force behind the 
growth of big business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cisco jumped 61 slots from No. 253 to 192, while Dell Computer  
shot up from No. 125 to 78. Microsoft, which is the top U.S. 
company in terms of market value, is ranked 109, up from 137 last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, profits at the Fortune 500 companies declined for the  
first time in seven years in 1998 as U.S. companies suffered the 
effects of the economic crisis in Asia, Russia and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	Profits fell 1.8 percent last year, compared to 7.8 percent  
earnings growth in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue growth shrank to 4 percent from 8.7 percent in 1997 as  
U.S. companies found demand for their products and services stifled 
by the ongoing financial problems overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	GM is followed by Ford with $144.4 billion, Wal-Mart with $139.2  
billion, Exxon with $101.7 billion and General Electric with $100.5 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM was sixth with $81.7 billion, followed by Citigroup with  
$76.4 billion, Philip Morris with $57.8 billion, Boeing with $56.1 
billion and AT&AMP;T with $53.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Chrysler, a perennial top-10 finisher, disappeared from the list  
as its merger with Daimler-Benz, made it a foreign company and 
therefore ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
	Several other megamergers shook up the rankings, with no less  
than 33 of the 47 new arrivals reaching the list by way of a 
merger, the magazine said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the largest deals were the Citibank-Travelers Group  
combination that propelled Citigroup into the No. 7 slot from 
Citibank's 1997 rank of 21 and the merger with MCI that sent 
WorldCom from No. 210 to No. 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-seven companies were bumped from the list. Two of the most  
notable were Reader's Digest, which fell from No. 490 to 529, and 
Borden, which slipped from 414 to 585. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest employer among the 500 was Wal-Mart with 910,000  
workers, followed by GM with 594,000.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Whitewater Prosecutor Testifies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The final witness in Susan McDougal's  
trial testified Monday that Kenneth Starr's office, in an effort to 
get Mrs. McDougal to talk, offered to let someone else decide 
whether she should be charged with perjury. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Starr prosecutor Ray Jahn said that Mrs. McDougal was  
told in 1996 that if there came a point where there was a question 
about whether she'd committed perjury, the matter would be turned 
over to an independent prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	The offer didn't do any good, Jahn testified in the fifth week  
of Mrs. McDougal's criminal contempt and obstruction trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal went to jail rather than talk with Starr's  
investigators, saying she was afraid she'd be charged with perjury 
unless she told Starr's office a story that implicated the 
president and first lady in wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Jahn, who won convictions against Mrs. McDougal, her ex-husband  
Jim, and then-Gov. Jim Guy Tucker in a 1996 Whitewater trial, gave 
a point-by-point rebuttal to Mrs. McDougal's sworn testimony that 
prosecutors tried to get her to tell lies about the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
	Closing arguments are set for Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Jahn denied:  
</P>
<P>
	--Ever saying he could make Mrs. McDougal's legal problems go  
away if she cooperated with Starr in the Clinton probe. Jahn 
acknowledged that a state prosecutor in California indicated he 
felt an embezzlement case against Mrs. McDougal could be resolved 
through plea negotiations rather than going to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	--Telling Jim McDougal that if his ex-wife would simply say she  
had a sexual affair with Clinton, she could ``write her own 
ticket'' with Starr's office. 
</P>
<P>
	On cross-examination, McDougal lawyer Mark Geragos tried to get  
Jahn to admit that Starr had a plan to convict Mrs. McDougal and 
``roll her'' over to testify against the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
	Jahn conceded there's always a possibility that ``today's  
defendant is tomorrow's witness'' but he said Starr's office simply 
wanted the ``total and complete truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jahn did say that Starr deputy Hickman Ewing contacted the  
federal Bureau of Prisons on Jim McDougal's behalf. Jim McDougal 
had complained that he wanted to be moved to a prison in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	A career federal prosecutor, Jahn testified he told Starr on  
going to work for the independent counsel ``that it was my hope 
that we would be able to clear the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jahn said he told Starr it wouldn't be good for the country to  
have the kind of disruption a criminal investigation of the 
president would bring.

<HEADLINE> Costner Plays in Big League Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- ``Field of Dreams'' star Kevin Costner  
realized one of his biggest dreams -- playing in a big league 
baseball game. 
</P>
<P>
	He also realized one of his biggest fears -- making an error  
Sunday to lose the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Costner dropped a ball in the sixth inning, allowing the scoring  
run as the Anaheim Angels defeated his alma mater, Cal State 
Fullerton, 2-1 in the Angels' exhibition finale. 
</P>
<P>
	Costner was hitless in three times at bat. But he made two tough  
plays at shortstop, and even pitched two-thirds of an inning, 
striking out rookie Jeb Daugherty and retiring Angels manager Terry 
Collins on a ground ball in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a really great day, but it would have been better  
without the error,'' Costner, 44, said. ``I felt really bad about 
making us lose the game. I just missed it in front of everybody. I 
really wanted to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Angels pitcher Chuck Finley liked what he saw from  
Costner. 
</P>
<P>
	``He actually handled himself pretty well out there,'' Finley  
said. ``You can tell he's a good athlete. He made a couple plays 
that impressed me, especially on that backhander.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Costner has starred in baseball movies as ``Field of Dreams''  
and ``Bull Durham,'' in which he performed his own baseball stunts. 
He recently played a pitcher in the upcoming ``For The Love of The 
Game.''

<HEADLINE> Amazon.com, Wal-Mart Settle Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Amazon.com and Wal-Mart Stores are settling a  
lawsuit charging that the online bookseller hired computer system 
managers away from Wal-Mart to steal the retailer's trade secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit, filed last fall, had charged that Amazon.com targeted  
the employees as well as Wal-Mart's software vendors to learn more 
about the retailer's information systems, which include data on 
sales, inventory and consumer buying habits. 
</P>
<P>
	In the settlement announced today, Amazon.com agreed to reassign  
some of the former Wal-Mart employees to jobs that don't mirror the 
positions they held at Wal-Mart. Amazon.com also said it would 
return Wal-Mart information brought by the former employees. 
</P>
<P>
	An Amazon.com spokesman, Bill Curry, said the information  
referred to ``old papers'' brought by Richard Dalzell, hired by 
Amazon.com as chief technology officer. He declined to be more 
specific. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wal-Mart spokeswoman Betsy Reithemeyer said ``thousands of  
Wal-Mart confidential documents'' already had been returned. 
</P>
<P>
	No damages are to be paid in the settlement, which does not call  
for Amazon.com to admit any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com settled the case to avoid costly and prolonged  
litigation, Curry said. Amazon.com is free to continue to hire 
Wal-Mart workers without the threat of litigation for two years, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts say Wal-Mart's database is only second in size to  
the U.S. government. Besides tracking raw sales, profit margin and 
inventory data, the system also documents what products consumers 
tend to buy together. 
</P>
<P>
	A database that extensive could help Amazon.com know which  
products and services would be most attractive to different 
customers, facilitating the online retailer's plant to expand into 
other areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com, however, maintains it wasn't trying to copy  
Wal-Mart's strategy.

<HEADLINE> Offer May Stop Rental Co. Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) -- United Rentals Inc., the largest  
equipment rental company in North America, is making an unsolicited 
$553 million offer for Rental Service Corp. -- a move that would 
stop a pending merger between Rental Service and NationsRent Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	If United Rentals' offer succeeds, the combined company would  
have annual revenue of about $3 billion, 700 branches and a rental 
fleet of more than 400,000 pieces of construction, industrial and 
landscaping equipment and tools. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the offer announced Monday, the Greenwich-based United  
Rentals would pay $22.75 a share for all of Rental Service's 
outstanding stock, a 28 percent premium over its 30-day average 
closing price. 
</P>
<P>
	United filed papers Monday in the Delaware Chancery Court  
seeking an injunction to stop the merger. The papers said the 
lawsuit was a ``challenge to a proposed merger based on an alleged 
breach of fiduciary duty.'' The lawsuit itself was not available 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Rental Service soared $5, or 29 percent, to close at  
$22.25 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The offer, good through April 30, is conditioned on getting a  
majority of the shares and the termination of the pending merger 
between Rental Service and NationsRent. 
</P>
<P>
	Rental Service is based in Scottsdale, Ariz., while NationsRent  
is based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, Rental Service announced a planned merger with  
NationsRent in which each NationsRent share would be exchanged for 
0.355 shares of Rental Service. Investors spurned the deal, 
however, sending shares in both companies plummeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger was to be completed around mid-May. If the Rental  
Service board agrees to the offer from United Rentals, it could 
result in a breakup fee of $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
	NationsRent said Monday that it remains committed to the merger.  
</P>
<P>
	On the NYSE, United Rentals' stock fell 93 3/4 cents to close at  
$27.81 3/4, while NationsRent stock slipped 43 3/4 cents to close at 
$5.93 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	United Rentals operates in 470 locations in the U.S. and Canada,  
most of them in major metropolitan areas. Rental Service operates 
in about 245 locations, mostly in medium- and smaller-sized 
markets, making it the third-largest rental company in North 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	Founded in September 1997, United Rentals has become North  
America's biggest equipment-rental concern by aggressively buying 
out the small operators who dominate the business. It has acquired 
107 companies, including 24 of the largest 100 companies in the 
industry.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Endorse Hate Crime Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton plans to endorse a bill  
Tuesday that would expand federal hate crime laws to include 
offenses based on sexual orientation, White House officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress failed to act on similar legislation last year.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also will direct that colleges be required to report  
hate crimes annually and announce a public-private partnership 
designed to educate middle school students against intolerance. 
</P>
<P>
	The partnership will involve AT&AMP;T, Court TV, Cable in the  
Classroom and the National Middle Schools Association working with 
the Justice and Education departments to develop curricula to 
combat intolerance. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president is signing this directive to increase public  
awareness and information about hate crimes among young people and 
doing whatever he can in his power to advance this cause while we 
wait for Congress to act,'' said Bruce Reed, the White House 
director of public policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was announcing the initiatives with religious, education  
and law enforcement leaders at a Roosevelt Room ceremony Tuesday, 
White House officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea for the middle schools program grew out of a White  
House conference on hate crimes that generated a lot of anecdotal 
information about ethnic and racial insensitivities among school 
children, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The aim, said a White House official who spoke on condition of  
anonymity, is to ``nip intolerance in the bud'' by educating 
children about its consequences. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Clinton will direct the Justice and Education  
departments to require that college campuses provide specific 
information about hate crimes in the campus crime statistics they 
provide to law enforcement each year. 
</P>
<P>
	The information will be used to generate hard data on how crimes  
of violence relate to intolerance on college campuses, the official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's hate crimes legislation died in committee in the House  
and Senate last year. The initiative was reintroduced last month by 
a bipartisan group of lawmakers, including Sens. Edward M. Kennedy, 
D-Mass., and Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and Reps. John Conyers, D-Mich., 
and Connie Morella, R-Md. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the bill, current law would be expanded so the Justice  
Department could prosecute crimes based on a person's sex, sexual 
orientation or disability. Now, the statute only covers crimes 
based on race, color, religion or national origin. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the bill would make federal prosecution of hate crimes  
easier. Current law limits prosecution to situations where the 
victim is targeted for engaging in certain federally protected 
activities, such as serving on a jury, voting or attending public 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 40 states have hate crimes laws but only 21 cover  
sexual orientation, 22 cover gender and 21 cover disability. 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsors are hoping that outrage over recent highly publicized  
killings will fuel support for the measure this year. 
</P>
<P>
	One of two young men charged in the slaying of gay college  
student Matthew Shepard in Wyoming pleaded guilty Monday and was 
sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Two men have been charged with beating to death a gay textile  
worker, Billy Jack Gaither, in Alabama earlier this year and 
burning his body on a pile of tires. 
</P>
<P>
	John William King, a white supremacist, was sentenced to death  
in Texas for chaining a black man, James Byrd Jr., behind a pickup 
truck and dragging him to his death. Two other men wait trial in 
the case.

<HEADLINE> Corn, Soybeans Retreat / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
        CHICAGO (AP) -- Corn and soybean futures retreated Monday on  
the Chicago Board of Trade amid nagging concerns about strong harvests 
in South America. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat futures advanced after shrugged off initial weakness  
tied to excellent crop conditions in winter wheat growing areas. 
</P>
<P>
        Corn and soybean prices fell back amid expectations that demand  
for U.S. exports, already at the lowest levels in years, will be hurt 
by the harvest of bumper crops in Argentina and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
        Futures prices also are under pressure from projections American  
farmers this spring will plant record acreage to soybeans and large 
tracts to corn, boosting inventories already at the highest level in 
more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat for July delivery rose 2 1/2 cents to $2.88 3/4 a bushel;  
May corn fell 3 1/4 cents to $2.18 3/4 a bushel; May oats fell 3 1/2 
cents to $1.11 a bushel; May soybeans fell 1 1/4 cents to $4.82 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
        Meat and livestock futures rose strongly on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange, with pork rising on higher cash market prices and beef boosted 
by fewer slaughter-ready cattle. 
</P>
<P>
        June live cattle rose 0.55 cent to 67.65 cents a pound; May  
feeder cattle rose 1.10 cents to 74 cents a pound; June lean hogs rose 
1.15 cents to 54.10 cents a pound; July pork bellies rose 0.60 cent 
to 52.30 cents a pound.

<P>
	The purchase is subject to approval by the Federal

<HEADLINE> FBI Wraps Up Search for Atheist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP WOOD, Texas (AP) -- FBI agents completed their search of a  
ranch in the investigation of the disappearance of atheist leader 
Madalyn Murray O'Hair. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Grant, assistant special agent in charge of the FBI's San  
Antonio office, wouldn't comment Sunday on whether the search was 
successful but said: ``It was not a waste of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	FBI agents descended on the south Texas pasture on Friday, using  
dogs, a backhoe and a helicopter with night vision equipment. The 
U.S. attorney's office said the ranchers about 100 miles west of 
San Antonio are not targets of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI has refused to confirm the subject of the investigation,  
but Texas Department of Public Safety officials have said it was 
helping federal agents in a search for evidence in the 1995 
disappearance of Mrs. O'Hair, her son, Jon Garth Murray, her 
granddaughter, Robin Murray O'Hair, and $500,000 in gold coins. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. O'Hair founded American Atheists Inc. Last month, David R.  
Waters, the former office manager for Mrs. O'Hair, and Gary P. Karr 
were arrested on weapons charges. Waters has denied involvement in 
the O'Hairs' disappearance and neither man has been charged in the 
disappearance case. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI agent Bill O'Leary reportedly testified during Karr's March  
26 detention hearing that Karr admitted being an accessory to four 
homicides in Texas and helping get rid of the victims and their 
property. 
</P>
<P>
	Karr's lawyer, Richard Helfrick, said his client cooperated with  
FBI questioning about homicides in Texas. Helfrick wouldn't say if 
Karr admitted a role in any slayings.

<HEADLINE> 'The Matrix' Scores at Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The futuristic ``The Matrix'' scored the  
year's biggest opening weekend at the box office with $27.8 
million, resurrecting Keanu Reeves' career as an action star and 
fueling Warner Bros.' comeback, final figures showed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Using dazzling special effects to tell a story that critics said  
didn't always make sense but was great to look at, ``The Matrix'' 
had the highest April debut for a film, topping last year's ``Lost 
in Space'' ($20.2 million), and became the biggest Easter weekend 
opener. 
</P>
<P>
	The film helped pull the movie industry out of its  
post-''Titanic'' funk, propelling the box office to only its second 
weekend this year with a higher overall gross than the year before, 
when the sinking ship film was sailing strong. The top films were 
up 6 percent last weekend from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Matrix'' easily beat the closest movies, both debuts, with  
the teen-oriented ``10 Things I Hate About You'' finishing second 
with $8.3 million and the Steve Martin-Goldie Hawn comedy vehicle 
``The Out-Of-Towners'' finishing third with $8.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	It also provided a lift to Reeves, whose career had been  
foundering since he appeared opposite Sandra Bullock in the action 
movie ``Speed'' in 1994. Though considered by some an unlikely 
choice for the film, Reeves trained for weeks for the demanding 
martial arts and stunts in ``The Matrix'' and impressed the 
directors with his grasp of the film's confusing story. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was right for it. He was willing to make a psychotic  
decision which was to learn all those stunts,'' said the film's 
producer, Joel Silver. 
</P>
<P>
	This is Warner Bros.' second hit of the year, following the mob  
comedy ``Analyze This,'' which had $6.3 million for fourth place, 
reversing the fortunes of a studio that languished for more than a 
year with just one big movie, Silver's ``Lethal Weapon 4'' last 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Still enjoying a warm Oscar glow, best-picture winner  
``Shakespeare in Love'' had $3.1 million for seventh and 
foreign-language winner ``Life is Beautiful'' had $2.7 million for 
ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	Here are the top 20 movies at North American theaters Friday  
through Sunday, followed by studio, gross, number of theater 
locations, average receipts per location, total gross and number of 
weeks in release, as compiled by Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. and

<HEADLINE> Main Tokyo Index Down at Midday / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was higher against the yen Tuesday  
morning after a rally to record levels on Wall Street. The Tokyo 
Stock Exchange's main index fell moderately. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.59 yen in morning trading, up 0.23 yen  
from late Monday in Tokyo but below its level of 121.83 yen in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average lost 117.38 points, or 0.72 percent, to  
end the morning session at 16,217.40. On Monday, the average 
finished up 44.59 points, or 0.27 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar held its strength after the Dow  
Jones industrial average moved back above 10,000 points. The Dow 
rose 174.82 points to close Monday at 10,007.33, exceeding the 
closing high of 10,006.33 recorded March 29. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's strength also derived from the continuing turmoil  
in Yugoslavia, where NATO forces intensified their bombing campaign 
against Serbian targets around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. currency is often seen as a safe haven for investors  
during times of international crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 130.32 yen, down  
from 130.61 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices started slightly higher  
following the strong showing on Wall Street, but moved into 
negative territory in quiet trading as the weak yen led traders to 
take profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 14.16 points, or 1.08 percent, to 1,293.01. 
The TOPIX closed up 3.00 points, or 0.23 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.745  
percent from Monday's finish of 1.740 percent, driving its price 
down to 100.47 yen from 100.51 yen.

<HEADLINE> Studios Counter 'Star Wars' Prequel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Fighting the Force with romance, two films  
with female appeal -- ``Notting Hill'' starring Julia Roberts and 
Hugh Grant and ``The Love Letter'' with Kate Capshaw and Tom 
Selleck -- will open close to the May 19 release date of ``Star 
Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace,'' studio officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The high-stakes scheduling decisions spoke to the power -- and  
possibilities -- that rival studios see in ``The Phantom Menace,'' 
one of the most highly anticipated films in recent years and one 
that many say has the potential to follow only ``Titanic'' in box 
office gross. 
</P>
<P>
	Most studios are steering their movies far clear of the ``Star  
Wars'' prequel. But others had second thoughts, particularly after 
last year's experience with ``Godzilla.'' Some studios regretted 
not putting films against the big lizard movie when it didn't live 
up to high expectations over Memorial Day weekend, then plummeted 
the following week. 
</P>
<P>
	With this history and other factors in mind, Universal Studios  
said Monday it had moved ``Notting Hill'' from June 18 to May 28 -- 
Memorial Day weekend-- putting the movie in competition with the 
second week of ``The Phantom Menace,'' which is being distributed 
by 20th Century Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought: Why not pick the film that is the perfect  
counter-programming,'' said Universal distribution head Nikki 
Rocco. ``Hopefully there's two audiences: kids who want to see 
'Star Wars' and mom and dad who'll be in the mood for a little 
romance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Notting Hill'' is the story of a travel bookstore owner  
(Grant) whose life turns upside down when a movie star (Roberts) 
walks into the store. Grant is reunited with the screenwriter and 
producer of his hit, ``Four Weddings and a Funeral.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, DreamWorks is sticking to its previously announced  
decision to open ``The Love Letter'' on May 21, just two days after 
``The Phantom Menace'' debuts on a Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The film tells of an unsigned love letter that intrigues people  
in a small New England town, as they wonder who it could have been 
from. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the time we put it on May 21, there were really not any  
movies being released at that time that we thought would take up 
all of our targeted audiences, which are females,'' said DreamWorks 
distribution chief James Tharp. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, DreamWorks is facing unexpected competition from ``Notting  
Hill,'' but Tharp said, ``We're locked in to that day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other studios, however, have decided to give the Jedi plenty of  
room to operate. Warner Bros. is among those that won't have a 
single movie out in May, launching its summer slate with the 
Independence Day weekend release ``Wild, Wild West'' starring Will 
Smith.

<HEADLINE> Mixed Results for Baseball's Stars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	How baseball's big stars did Monday on opening day:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Albert Belle. Hit a three-run homer and an RBI single in his  
Baltimore debut, a 10-7 win over Tampa Bay. The crowd of 46,733 at 
Camden Yards gave him a standing ovation, and the surly slugger 
responded with a curtain call. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Cal Ripken. Forced to leave the Orioles' game in the third  
inning because of a stiff lower back and was listed as day-to-day. 
Last year, he voluntarily ended his record streak of 2,632 
consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Kevin Brown. Baseball's first $100 million man allowed three  
home runs in his Dodgers debut, but Los Angeles beat Arizona 8-6 in 
11 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Randy Johnson. The Big Unit struck out nine in his first game  
since signing a $52.4 million contract with Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Raul Mondesi. The top performance of the day -- hit a tying,  
three-run homer with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning, 
then hit a two-run homer in the 11th that lifted Los Angeles over 
Arizona 8-6. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Wade Boggs. Got two hits for Tampa Bay, moving him within 76  
of the 3,000 milestone. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Barry Bonds. Set an NL record with his 290th career  
intentional walk, breaking Hank Aaron's record in San Francisco's 
11-8 victory over Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Juan Gonzalez. Broke up Brian Moehler's no-hit bid by singling  
with one out in the seventh inning as Detroit defeated Texas 11-5. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Pedro Martinez. Struck out nine and was the winning pitcher as  
Boston beat Kansas City 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Tom Glavine. The NL Cy Young winner took the loss as Curt  
Schilling and the Philadelphia Phillies beat Atlanta 7-4. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Alex Fernandez. Pitching for the first time since wrecking his  
shoulder in the 1997 NL championship series, he led Florida over 
the New York Mets 6-2.

<HEADLINE> Griffey Hits Home Run in Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Ken Griffey Jr. homered in his second at-bat of  
the season Monday night, connecting after career home run king Hank 
Aaron threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey, who led the American League with 56 homers last season,  
hit a 401-foot drive over the right-center field wall in the third 
inning. The Seattle star homered off James Baldwin of the Chicago 
White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	After crossing home plate, Griffey gestured to Aaron in the  
Mariners' broadcasting booth. The shot gave the Mariners a 2-1 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey hit his seventh opening-day home run, tying the record  
shared by Babe Ruth, Willie Mays, Eddie Mathews and Carl 
Yastrzemski. Frank Robinson leads the all-time list with eight. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey, 29, starting his 11th major league season, hit his  
351st career homer. He is given the best chance among active 
players at catching Aaron's mark of 755 set in 23 seasons.

<HEADLINE>  Maine's Hockey Team Returns Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- A cross-country trip was well worthwhile  
for the Maine Black Bears. 
</P>
<P>
	The pep band played and about 100 fans cheered and tossed  
confetti Sunday night as the Maine hockey team returned from 
winning its second NCAA championship this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Angus King embraced Coach Shawn Walsh as the weary team  
disembarked from a plane at the Portland International Jetport 
after traveling back from Anaheim, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an unbelievable weekend,'' said goalie Alfie Michaud,  
who turned away 46 shots during the Black Bears' 3-2 overtime 
victory over New Hampshire in the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans were still basking after the win over the archrival  
Wildcats on Saturday night, secured on Marcus Gustafsson's rebound 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``You couldn't ask for a better game. You couldn't write a  
better story. It was the perfect ending,'' said Terry Tucker, who 
traveled from Dayton to greet the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Mathy Matturro, a Maine student, said she was in tears when the  
Black Bears won. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the puck went through the goal, I was bawling. Can you  
say, `hyperventilating?' '' said Matturro, who is a volunteer 
statistician for the team. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears' triumphant return followed postgame celebrations that  
were marred by rowdiness. Students knocked down the goalposts at 
the football field and lit a bonfire on the mall in the center of 
campus. They tossed in several park benches, door frames and 
screens. About 100 students were involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unclear to me how, but somehow a snowmobile got put into  
it, too,'' said university spokesman Joe Carr. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no arrests on campus. Carr said that most of the  
9,500 students celebrated in an orderly fashion. 
</P>
<P>
	Students and fans were glued to their television sets across the  
state Saturday evening as Maine and New Hampshire went into 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was hoping it would be a blowout, and we wouldn't have to  
put up with the tension,'' senior Ryan Eslinger said Saturday 
night. ``You could just feel the tension in the room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last time Maine won the NCAA championship was in 1993. The  
Bears lost to Boston University in the final in 1995 and were then 
barred from tournament play for two years for NCAA violations that 
resulted in Walsh being suspended. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears were sixth in Hockey East last season before returning  
to championship form. 
</P>
<P>
	``This one shows we're back,'' said Chris White, director of the  
24-member pep band. 
</P>
<P>
	The game carried ramifications beyond the realm of sports and  
into the arena of politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire was on the losing side of a bet  
with Maine Sen. Susan Collins. Because the Wildcats lost, he must 
sing the Maine fight song for the Maine State Society in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire coach Dick Umile had no complaint with his  
players' effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a great college hockey game,'' he said. ``These were  
two teams that deserved to be here. Unfortunately, they just got 
one more goal than we did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maine goalie Alfie Michaud, honored as the outstanding player of  
the Final Four, stopped 46 shots, and New Hampshire's Ty Conklin 
stopped 36, with each goalie coming up with spectacular saves. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was great goaltending on both sides,'' Umile said.  
</P>
<P>
	Added Walsh: ``Both of them are terrific goalies. I told Ty  
after the game that he'd be back in a game like this.''

</P>
<P>
	Bibb, a member of the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame and a  
two-time president of the Golf Writers Association of America, died 
Sunday at St. Thomas Hospital.

Seigenthaler, chairman emeritus of The Tennessean. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was that, of course. But more than anything else he was a

to me a great friend.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Flagg Will Rely on Insanity Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Debra Puglisi was working in her garden  
last spring when a man slipped into her house and killed her 
startled husband. The man then tied her up and stuffed her in the 
trunk of his car. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said she remained a prisoner in Donald Flagg's home for  
four days until he went to work and she managed to loosen her ropes 
and call police. 
</P>
<P>
	For prosecutors ready to begin jury selection Tuesday in Flagg's  
trial on charges of murder, kidnapping and rape, there is seemingly 
incontrovertible evidence from the defendant himself: a videotaped 
confession to police. 
</P>
<P>
	But Flagg's defense also may rely on that same videotape, asking  
the jury to question whether anyone in his right mind could so 
calmly confess to the details of so gruesome and random a crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Flagg, a 41-year-old former autoworker, has pleaded innocent.  
His public defender will try to convince a jury that Flagg, who is 
on medication for schizophrenia, is not guilty by reason of 
insanity. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted of first-degree murder, Flagg could face the death  
penalty. Opening statements are scheduled for April 13 and the 
trial is expected to last three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said from the beginning it was a random crime. Flagg, who  
had been smoking crack, saw Mrs. Puglisi outside her Newark home 
April 20, 1998, parked his car and entered the house through an 
unlocked door, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	When he ran into Anthony Puglisi, a funeral home planner, Flagg  
shot him in the head, then drank a few beers while waiting for Mrs. 
Puglisi to come inside, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	As she washed her hands in the kitchen, Flagg grabbed her,  
punched her in the head and took her to the basement where he 
sexually assaulted her, police said. Then, he took her to his home 
where the assaults continued, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
	It was only when Flagg finally returned to work four days later  
that the 49-year-old hospice nurse wriggled free from her ropes and 
called police. 
</P>
<P>
	On the 911 tape, she pleaded for help and said Flagg had killed  
her husband. ``He said he saw me in the yard and wanted me. He was 
waiting in my house for me,'' she said on the tape. 
</P>
<P>
	While it is Associated Press policy not to identify sexual  
assault victims, Mrs. Puglisi's name was widely reported during the 
four days she was missing and she has given interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	In Flagg's videotaped confession, he calmly described the crime,  
pointing a finger between his eyes to demonstrate how he shot 
Puglisi. His tone conversational, Flagg asked authorities how Debra 
Puglisi was doing. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense case is expected to rely on testimony from a  
psychiatrist, Dr. Carol Tavani, who also testified for the defense 
at Wilmington lawyer Thomas Capano's murder trial. The medical 
history of some of Flagg's family members may be used to bolster 
the case, court records indicate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're presenting this defense in good faith and we certainly  
hope and expect to prevail,'' said public defender J. Brendan 
O'Neill. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys are forbidden to discuss the case in any detail under  
a gag order imposed by Superior Court Judge Norman Barron, but 
legal experts say the insanity defense is rarely used. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the law, to find Flagg not guilty by reason of insanity,  
jurors must find that he ``lacked substantial capacity to 
appreciate the wrongfulness'' of his conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	That would win him commitment to a psychiatric institution,  
where he could potentially be released if treated successfully. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury could also find Flagg ``guilty, but mentally ill,''  
which could keep him from ever being released from custody. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a recent study sponsored by the National Institute  
of Mental Health, an insanity defense was used in less than 1 
percent of criminal cases in the eight states examined. 
</P>
<P>
	``The likelihood of success is not good,'' said Dr. Howard  
Zonana, a Yale professor and forensic psychiatrist in New Haven, 
Conn. ``The public is very distrustful.''

</P>
<P>
	The company has been renamed Worldwide Flight Services Inc., the

</P>
<P>
	The acquisition was made by Castle Harlan Partners III, a $630

</P>
<P>
	The company has been one of the world's largest providers of

<HEADLINE> 5 Supreme Court Justices Are Absent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The ritual that begins each Supreme Court  
session -- the marshal's command of ``Oyez, oyez, oyez,'' the 
courtroom crowd rising to its feet, the justices appearing from 
behind scarlet curtains to take the bench -- was missing something 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Or rather, it was missing someone. Actually, five someones.  
</P>
<P>
	Only four of the court's nine members showed up for the brief  
session in which the court released orders and announced decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist ran the show as usual, but  
only Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen 
G. Breyer flanked him. The other five chairs were empty. 
</P>
<P>
	The missing: Justices John Paul Stevens, Antonin Scalia, Anthony  
M. Kennedy, David H. Souter and Clarence Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the absenteeism, court spokesman Ed Turner refused  
to comment.

<HEADLINE> Mariners Offers Griffey $100M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Ken Griffey Jr. has been offered several contract  
alternatives worth at least $105 million, The Seattle Times 
reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey said he had not yet responded formally to the team's  
multiple offers, all of which reach the level of Kevin Brown's 
record $105 million, seven-year deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers, 
the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just to get it done? I don't think so, not with two years on  
my present contract,'' he was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking before Monday night's season opener against Chicago,  
Griffey refused to confirm the offers. His agent, Brian Goldberg, 
said last month that the Mariners had begun talks on a possible 
extension. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm tired of all the questions about my contract. If I'm not  
worried about it, I don't think anyone else should be,'' Griffey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey has two seasons left in a $34 million, four-year  
contract, one that made him baseball's highest-paid player when he 
agreed to the extension in January 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle also wants to work out an extension with All-Star  
shortstop Alex Rodriguez, who has two seasons left in a $10.6 
million five-year deal and will be eligible for free agency at the 
unusually young age of 25. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why don't we just let myself and Alex play baseball?'' Griffey  
said. ``It's 1999. Let's worry about what happens on the field. All 
I want to do is play baseball and not think about contracts. You 
guys are not going to be able to figure me out because there's 
nothing to figure out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey downplayed the dollar figure while talking to The Times,  
saying: ``It ain't about money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Griffey and Rodriguez are concerned whether the Mariners  
will spend enough to win. He's been in Seattle for 10 years and 
still hasn't reached the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I'm not getting any younger,'' he said. ``The one thing  
you can't buy in this game is that ring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he worries about what the team will do about other key  
players, including Jay Buhner, Edgar Martinez, Dan Wilson, David 
Segui, Jamie Moyer. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of them are up at the end of this year. If they all go  
unsigned, I hope the Mariners don't expect Alex and I to play with 
six, seven guys we don't even know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would object if the Mariners tried to trade star  
Rodriguez at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone believes I will be the one to stay, that I will be  
easier to sign than Alex. That is not necessarily true,'' Griffey 
said. ``They have six or seven other guys to sign before they deal 
with us, and there isn't one of them (who) wouldn't defer money to 
help us win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey said winning is the most important thing to him.  
</P>
<P>
	``I want this to be the Mariners' year for so many reasons,'' he  
said. ``But we need that good start. If we go 1-9, all the 
questions are going to be fired at me and Alex. Regardless of 
anything, I'll be the last one they get rid of.''

<HEADLINE> Can Antibiotic Stop Heart Attacks? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Could taking an antibiotic spare heart  
patients from future heart attacks, bypass surgery or even death? 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers hope to find out with a federally funded study based  
on growing evidence a common bacterial infection may trigger heart 
attacks and worsen, perhaps even cause, atherosclerosis -- narrowing 
of the arteries from plaque deposits. 
</P>
<P>
	Given that known risk factors for heart disease such as smoking,  
high cholesterol and high blood pressure can't account for many 
cases, doctors increasingly suspect infectious agents may be partly 
to blame for some of the 1.75 million heart attacks, bypass 
surgeries and artery-clearing angioplasties in this country each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The prime suspect: a bacteria called Chlamydia pneumoniae, a  
cousin to the sexually transmitted form of Chlamydia that instead 
causes pneumonia and bronchitis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe 60 percent of the population have gotten it in the  
past,'' often without becoming ill, said Dr. John Kostis, chairman 
of medicine at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New 
Brunswick, one of 26 sites used in the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Jeffrey Anderson, chief of cardiology at the University of  
Utah Medical Center in Salt Lake City, said that just as doctors 
have learned many peptic ulcers are caused by a bacterial infection 
and can be treated with antibiotics, the same could be true with 
some heart disease cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``Antibiotic therapy could become a major breakthrough treatment  
against a disease that kills more Americans each year than any 
other disease,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Half of the 4,000 heart disease patients to be studied will be  
given a weekly antibiotic pill, Zithromax, for one year, while the 
comparison group gets a dummy pill. Neither will know who is taking 
which pill. 
</P>
<P>
	The two groups will be compared over four years to see which has  
more heart ``events'' -- deaths, heart attacks, increasing 
atherosclerosis requiring surgery, and major chest pain, which 
indicates the heart isn't getting enough oxygenated blood. 
</P>
<P>
	Blood from some patients will be tested to see if the antibiotic  
is killing the bacteria, lead researcher Dr. J. Thomas Grayston, 
professor of epidemiology at the University of Washington in 
Seattle, said last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Zithromax was chosen because it is long-acting and, unlike most  
antibiotics, can get inside cells, where the tough-to-kill 
Chlamydia can hide, dormant, for years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent surge of research generally shows the majority of  
patients studied who had heart attacks or other complications had 
been infected by Chlamydia pneumoniae. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know if it's a cause or an innocent bystander,'' said  
Sonia Skarlatos of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, a 
part of the National Institutes of Health providing $11 million for 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
	Early, small studies have shown that giving Zithromax, known  
generically as azithromycin, to patients after a heart attack 
reduces chances of a second one. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer, the drug's maker, is conducting a similar trial, giving  
the antibiotic for three months to half of the 3,600 heart attack 
victims in the study, according to Michael Dunne, director of its 
central research division in Groton, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	Grayston said comparing results of the three-month and yearlong  
treatments, and other differences between the two studies, could 
help in determining which patients might benefit most from 
preventive antibiotic treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to be like immunization for polio, make (heart  
disease) go away,'' Kostis said, but it may well help many heart 
patients. 
</P>
<P>

study should call the coordinating center at 206-577-0259.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Endorse Hate Crime Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton plans to endorse a bill  
Tuesday that would expand federal hate crime laws to include 
offenses based on sexual orientation, White House officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress failed to act on similar legislation last year.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also will direct that colleges be required to report  
hate crimes annually and announce a public-private partnership 
designed to educate middle school students against intolerance. 
</P>
<P>
	The partnership will involve AT&AMP;T, Court TV, Cable in the  
Classroom and the National Middle Schools Association working with 
the Justice and Education departments to develop curricula to 
combat intolerance. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president is signing this directive to increase public  
awareness and information about hate crimes among young people and 
doing whatever he can in his power to advance this cause while we 
wait for Congress to act,'' said Bruce Reed, the White House 
director of public policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was announcing the initiatives with religious, education  
and law enforcement leaders at a Roosevelt Room ceremony Tuesday, 
White House officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea for the middle schools program grew out of a White  
House conference on hate crimes that generated a lot of anecdotal 
information about ethnic and racial insensitivities among school 
children, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The aim, said a White House official who spoke on condition of  
anonymity, is to ``nip intolerance in the bud'' by educating 
children about its consequences. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Clinton will direct the Justice and Education  
departments to require that college campuses provide specific 
information about hate crimes in the campus crime statistics they 
provide to law enforcement each year. 
</P>
<P>
	The information will be used to generate hard data on how crimes  
of violence relate to intolerance on college campuses, the official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's hate crimes legislation died in committee in the House  
and Senate last year. The initiative was reintroduced last month by 
a bipartisan group of lawmakers, including Sens. Edward M. Kennedy, 
D-Mass., and Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and Reps. John Conyers, D-Mich., 
and Connie Morella, R-Md. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the bill, current law would be expanded so the Justice  
Department could prosecute crimes based on a person's sex, sexual 
orientation or disability. Now, the statute only covers crimes 
based on race, color, religion or national origin. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the bill would make federal prosecution of hate crimes  
easier. Current law limits prosecution to situations where the 
victim is targeted for engaging in certain federally protected 
activities, such as serving on a jury, voting or attending public 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 40 states have hate crimes laws but only 21 cover  
sexual orientation, 22 cover gender and 21 cover disability. 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsors are hoping that outrage over recent highly publicized  
killings will fuel support for the measure this year. 
</P>
<P>
	One of two young men charged in the slaying of gay college  
student Matthew Shepard in Wyoming pleaded guilty Monday and was 
sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Two men have been charged with beating to death a gay textile  
worker, Billy Jack Gaither, in Alabama earlier this year and 
burning his body on a pile of tires. 
</P>
<P>
	John William King, a white supremacist, was sentenced to death  
in Texas for chaining a black man, James Byrd Jr., behind a pickup 
truck and dragging him to his death. Two other men wait trial in 
the case.

<HEADLINE> Shipbuilder Faces Safety Fines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Federal safety regulators today cited  
Avondale Industries Inc., a major U.S. Navy shipbuilder, for 
hundreds of workplace safety violations, the most serious involving 
inadequate protection to keep workers from taking potentially 
deadly falls. 
</P>
<P>
	The 437 violations alleged by the U.S. Occupational Safety and  
Health Administration carry $537,000 in proposed fines. 
</P>
<P>
	The action came after complaints from the Metal Trades Council  
of the AFL-CIO, which has been engaged in a bitter fight with the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	``This continued willful disregard for their employees' safety  
is unacceptable,'' said Charles N. Jeffress, the assistant 
secretary of labor for OSHA. 
</P>
<P>
	An attorney for Avondale said the company was the victim of a  
biased investigation and expected to prove that during an appeal. 
The company has 15 days to contest the citations. 
</P>
<P>
	The violations were alleged in 60 citations issued by OSHA  
following a six-month investigation at Avondale's yard, one of 
Louisiana's largest employers with about 6,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The most serious allegations involved willful violations of  
federal standards in providing workers adequate protection from 
falling, including having improper scaffolding and guard rails and 
not having manholes and other small openings properly covered. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffress said that of the seven deaths at Avondale since 1990,  
three of them were caused by falls. He said that OSHA inspectors 
had pointed out the problems in previous examinations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would not take this type of action if we did not consider  
this violations serious to the health and safety of employees,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Avondale officials said they expected a large number  
of citations to be issued, along with a large fine, but said the 
investigation by OSHA was biased and some of its workers had 
created violations through sabotage. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very unusual for a company to accuse its own employees of  
sabotage,'' Jeffress said. ``It's very unusual for a company to 
question the integrity and professionalism of our investigators.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation was conducted by a team of OSHA inspectors  
from around the country with expertise in shipyards, Jeffress said. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 256 instances of alleged fall-protection violations  
were contained in four citations issued by OSHA. Fifty-five other 
citations covered 207 violations involved such items as stairs, 
ladders, respirators, sanitation welding and protective equipment 
for workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Another citation was issued for a sewerage problem at the yard,  
OSHA said. 
</P>
<P>
	Avondale attorney Horace A. ``Topper'' Thompson said he expected  
all of the citations to be tossed out by an administrative law 
judge. He said OSHA's team leader on the inspection ``had the same 
agenda'' as the union. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past six years, Avondale has refused to recognize a  
collective bargaining election held in 1993 by the Metal Trades 
Council. The results of that election, which favored the union, are 
being challenged in federal court by the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Avondale has a proposed merger pending with Newport News  
Shipbuilding. The Pentagon and the Justice Department have not 
objected to the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	However, General Dynamics Corp. has made a $1.36 billion offer  
to buy Newport News, a deal that analysts say could scuttle the 
Avondale merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson said both the Navy and Newport News had been kept  
apprised about the investigation, as well as the company's 
allegations about the propriety of the inspection. OSHA also was 
informed by letter about the company's concerns a month ago, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Monday on the Nasdaq Stock Market, shares of Avondale  
fell 18 3/4 cents to $29.81 1/4.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft To Offer Privacy Tools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hoping to jump-start a promising new privacy  
technology, Microsoft and a prominent Internet group will offer a 
free digital tool kit that one day will allow consumers to restrict 
what personal information Web sites collect about them. 
</P>
<P>
	These new tools, to be announced today, initially will help  
Internet companies write electronic privacy promises that can 
automatically be evaluated by a Web browser or other software using 
a nascent technology called the platform for privacy preferences, 
or P3P. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers today must manually find a company's privacy statement  
online, if one exists, and read through legalese to determine what 
information a Web site might be harvesting, such as their name, 
e-mail address or even favorite authors or clothing sizes. 
</P>
<P>
	Using the new technology, a customer's Internet browser could  
electronically interpret a company's promises, issuing a warning 
only if it can't find a statement or if the Web site wants more 
information than a consumer is willing to disclose. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite support from the world's largest software company,  
hurdles remain and widespread adoption is months, if not years, 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology is mired in a patent dispute and also almost  
certainly will require tens of millions of people on the Internet 
to install new browser software. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's new tools, for example, are based partly on a  
relatively new computer code called extensible markup language, or 
XML, that even the most current versions of some browsers don't yet 
fully support. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft and the San Francisco-based Electronic Frontier  
Foundation planned to make their announcement today at the opening 
of an important privacy conference in Washington. They will propose 
changes in a key specification controlled by the World Wide Web 
Consortium, an Internet standards group, which would allow online 
merchants to use their new digital tools. 
</P>
<P>
	``The technology they're announcing probably isn't the final  
answer, but it's a real positive step,'' said Rick White, former 
co-chairman of the Congressional Internet Caucus who now practices 
technology law in Washington state. ``I'm not certain that 
technology will solve all the problems -- there are some gaps you 
might have to fix in a legislative way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Congress and the Clinton administration have threatened the  
industry with tough new privacy laws unless companies adequately 
regulate themselves over ways they collect customer information 
across the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Union already has passed laws that prohibit the  
transfer of personal information about its citizens without their 
consent to any outside country. The White House is negotiating to 
see how those laws might affect U.S. businesses on the Internet, 
where international borders are blurred. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to get a lot of the system up to speed  
quickly,'' predicted Tara Lemmey, executive director of the 
Electronic Frontier Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement is the industry's answer to what it describes  
as a frustrating chicken-and-egg problem -- how to encourage 
Internet consumers to use the new privacy technology until Web 
sites begin to offer electronic promises that can be understood by 
the technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're trying to do here is build a foundation,'' said  
Saul Klein, a group program manager at Microsoft. ``We're not 
saying that we think this is the answer to self-regulation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One serious problem for the technology is a legal battle with  
Seattle-based Intermind Corp., which earlier this year won a patent 
important to P3P. The company has said it is willing to license the 
technology for a reasonable price. 
</P>
<P>
	``Good software patents are expensive, and we were way ahead of  
the curve,'' said Drummond Reed, the company's chief technology 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web consortium said the group is ``looking seriously ... at  
the validity and applicability of this patent.''

</P>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- John Bibb, retired sports editor for The  
Tennessean, who once was nominated for Pulitzer Prize and covered 
36 straight Masters golf tournaments, died Sunday of cancer. He was 
72. 
</P>
<P>
	Bibb, a member of the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame and a  
two-time president of the Golf Writers Association of America, 
worked for The Tennessean from 1942 until his retirement in 1993. 
He was sports editor for the last 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
	He was nominated for a Pulitzer in 1980 for a series of columns  
calling for a U.S. boycott of the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	Bibb covered numerous U.S. Opens and PGA Championships, the  
British Open and Ryder Cup matches. He covered his first Masters in 
1949. 
</P>
<P>
	Bibb later crossed over into radio. He was a sports commentator  
on WSM's ``Waking Crew'' program and later joined the 
``Roundtable'' program, where he offered views on politics and 
other topics.

</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gary Blonston, chief of the Knight Ridder  
Washington news bureau and a veteran journalist, died Sunday of 
cancer. He was 56. 
</P>
<P>
	During a career that spanned nearly 36 years, Blonston served as  
a reporter, editor and writing coach. He worked at The Miami 
Herald, The Detroit Free Press and the San Jose Mercury News before 
coming to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan Wolman, former Washington bureau chief of The  
Associated Press and now the AP's managing editor, said of 
Blonston: ``He ran one of the best bureaus in town, constantly 
juggling between hard news coverage and the sort of perspective 
pieces that newspapers need from Washington. He had a refined sense 
of irony, just what you need to make sense of it all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blonston was a principal writer on two Pulitzer Prize-winning  
projects. One was during his time at the Free Press, when he came 
under gunfire while covering Detroit's 1967 riots. Blonston also 
worked on the Mercury News' reporting of the 1989 Loma Prieta 
earthquake in the San Francisco Bay area. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1968, Blonston found himself in the middle of rioting  
protesters and police officers outside the Democratic National 
Convention in Chicago. Coughing from tear gas, he dictated his 
story to an editor on deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Blonston also freelanced for newspapers and magazines, on topics  
ranging from politics to prehistoric art. During a 1967 strike at 
the Free Press -- when Blonston was working at Chrysler Corp. -- he 
wrote a book on the history of the Plymouth. In 1996, he published 
``William Morris,'' a book about a famed glass blower. 
</P>
<P>
	Blonston began his newspaper career with The Miami Herald in  
1964, moving to the Free Press two years later. 
</P>
<P>
	He moved to San Jose in 1987, then to Knight Ridder's Washington  
bureau. He became bureau chief in August 1995, supervising a staff 
of 60 reporters and editors. 
</P>
<P>
	Blonston is survived by his wife, Susan Goldberg, a deputy  
managing editor at USA Today, two children from a previous marriage 
and a sister.

	Denney served as the lone test pilot for the company, before  
several veterans joined the business at the end of World War II and 
it became known as Mid-Continent Manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
	The company was soon commissioned by the federal government to  
create complex aircraft structures and nondestructive test 
materials. That funding enabled Denney to merge the business with 
tiny Pasadena-based Automation Instruments in 1952 to form 
Automation Industries Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	While still at the helm of that company, he branched off into  
oil drilling in 1962, forming the independent San Antonio-based 
Venus Oil Co. He later invested in the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in 
Beverly Hills, helping to restore it to profitability before 
selling his share in 1985 for $33 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But he is perhaps best known for orchestrating a score of  
mergers during his three decades as president, chairman of the 
board and chief executive officer of Automation Industries, which 
he sold to General Cable in 1978 for $106 million.

</P>
<P>
	Gustafson sold the Tropicana in 1979, but was under

<HEADLINE> High Tech Execs Back Bush Candidacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Fifty-five executives with ties to the  
high-tech world urged Texas Gov. George W. Bush to run for 
president Monday, saying they liked his views on education, 
litigation and regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need visionary leaders who understand the New Economy,''  
the executives wrote in an advertisement they placed in Monday's 
editions of the San Jose Mercury News' business section. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look forward to a spirited bipartisan debate on the issues  
and encourage George W. Bush to run for president to ensure that 
the United States continues to symbolize the best the future has to 
offer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, a Republican, has formed a presidential exploratory  
committee, but has not said definitively whether he will run for 
the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those on the list of Bush backers are Jim Barksdale,  
president and CEO of Netscape Communications; Bob Herbold, chief 
operating officer of Microsoft Corp.; Jeff Henley, chief financial 
officer of Oracle Corp; and Steve Behm, a vice president of Cisco 
Systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The others are executives at finance, law, semiconductor,  
software and hardware firms. 
</P>
<P>
	They praised Bush for ``creating an environment that stresses  
personal responsibility over government intervention, and 
innovation over regulation.''

<HEADLINE> Court OKs Searches of Car Passengers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Passengers' personal belongings are fair game  
when police officers search a car for criminal evidence against the 
driver, the Supreme Court ruled Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-3 decision reinstated a Wyoming drug conviction and  
expanded the already considerable police power to stop and search 
vehicles without a court warrant. Police officials praised the 
ruling, but defense lawyers condemned it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Officers must be free of unreasonable, confusing and  
unworkable restrictions on what may be searched,'' said Robert 
Scully of the National Association of Police Organizations. He 
thanked the court for ``giving officers the tools they need to do 
their jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Lisa Kemler of the National Association of Criminal Defense  
Lawyers called the decision ``an abomination,'' adding: ``You get 
in a car and, as a passenger, you basically have no rights. Almost 
anything goes, as long as police can come up with some reason to 
say they expected to find evidence of a crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Fine of the Legal Aid Society in New York said the ruling  
wrongly ``introduces an element of guilt by association.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Constitution's Fourth Amendment, which protects against  
unreasonable police searches and seizures, generally requires 
police to obtain court warrants. Since 1925, the Supreme Court has 
carved out numerous exceptions when police targets are in vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	In a key 1996 ruling, the justices said police can stop  
motorists for routine traffic violations such as a faulty brake 
light even if the officers really want to search for illegal drugs. 
Monday's ruling means officers who participate in such stops can 
search all containers in the car if something gives them reason to 
believe they will find drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The court's latest ruling on privacy rights stems from a routine  
traffic stop, a situation that arises countless times daily across 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	A car driven by David Young was stopped for speeding on  
Interstate 25 in Natrona County, Wyo., in the early morning hours 
of July 23, 1995. After a Highway Patrol officer saw a hypodermic 
syringe in Young's pocket, Young acknowledged that he had used it 
to take drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	During the ensuing search, two other officers asked the car's  
two female passengers to get out of the car. One of them, Sandra 
Houghton, left her purse on the car's back seat. Inside it, police 
found drug paraphernalia and liquid methamphetamine. 
</P>
<P>
	She was convicted on a felony charge but appealed.  
</P>
<P>
	The Wyoming Supreme Court threw out her conviction last year,  
ruling that police were justified only in searching the car for 
drugs Young may have had with him -- and therefore could not search 
Houghton's purse. 
</P>
<P>
	Writing for the nation's highest court, Justice Antonin Scalia  
said the Wyoming court was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``Effective law enforcement would be appreciably impaired  
without the ability to search a passenger's personal belongings 
when there is reason to believe contraband or evidence of criminal 
wrongdoing is hidden in the car,'' Scalia said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sensible rule ... is that such a package may be searched,  
whether or not its owner is present as a passenger or otherwise, 
because it may contain the contraband that the officer has reason 
to believe is in the car,'' Scalia said. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that car passengers ``will often be engaged in a common  
enterprise with the driver and have the same interest in concealing 
the fruits or the evidence of their wrongdoing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision, however, did not give police the authority to pat  
down or search the pockets of a passenger when looking for evidence 
linked to the driver. Such tactics were banned by a 1948 Supreme 
Court ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Scalia in reinstating Houghton's conviction were Chief  
Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, 
Anthony M. Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Stephen G. Breyer. 
</P>
<P>
	In dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens wrote that the court had  
created ``a new rule'' that would let police search even a taxi 
passenger's briefcase if they had reason to believe the driver had 
a syringe somewhere in his vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining him in dissent were Justices David H. Souter and Ruth  
Bader Ginsburg.

<HEADLINE> Court OKs Searches of Car Passengers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Police can search the personal belongings of  
all passengers inside a car when lawfully seeking criminal evidence 
against the driver, the Supreme Court ruled today. 
</P>
<P>
	By a 6-3 vote in a Wyoming case, the court expanded the already  
considerable police power to search motor vehicles without a court 
warrant. 
</P>
<P>
	``Effective law enforcement would be appreciably impaired  
without the ability to search a passenger's personal belongings 
when there is reason to believe contraband or evidence of criminal 
wrongdoing is hidden in the car,'' Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for 
the court. 
</P>
<P>
	In dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens said, ``Today, instead of  
adhering to the settled distinction between drivers and passengers, 
the court fashions a new rule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under that rule, Stevens said, police might be able to search a  
taxi passenger's briefcase if they had reason to believe the driver 
had a syringe somewhere in his vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	In other cases today, the court:  
</P>
<P>
	--Said criminal defendants who plead guilty have a constitutional  
right to remain silent at sentencing without judges holding it 
against them, the Supreme Court ruled today. Judges cannot impose 
harsher punishment if such defendants refuse to give details about 
the crime, said the justices' 5-4 decision in a Pennsylvania drug 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ruled prosecutors cannot be sued for having lawyers searched  
and interfering with their ability to advise a client appearing 
before a grand jury, the Supreme Court said today. The court ruled 
unanimously that such action by California prosecutors in the 
Menendez brothers' murder case did not violate a lawyer's 
constitutional right to practice his profession. 
</P>
<P>
	--Agreed to review the death sentence of a convicted Virginia  
killer whose scheduled Tuesday execution it postponed last week. 
The justices said they will decide whether death row inmate Terry 
Williams should get a federal court hearing on his claims that he 
was denied adequate legal help during his sentencing trial.

<HEADLINE> China OKs Four Foreign Insurers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China granted licenses to four foreign insurance  
companies on Monday after saying earlier it would open its tightly 
controlled insurance market to competition from abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	The license issues to the U.S., Canadian and British firms come  
on the eve of Premier Zhu Rongji's departure for a 14-day visit to 
the United States and Canada. He hopes to win a deal in Washington 
on China's entry to the World Trade Organization, and insurance and 
other financial services are a sticking point in the protracted 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's newcomers are the Chubb Group of Insurance Cos. and  
John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co., both of the U.S., Sun Life 
Assurance Co. of Canada and Britain's Prudential Corp. They join 
nine other insurers doing business in China. 
</P>
<P>
	Granting the licenses will help to ``further restructure China's  
insurance mechanism and to open wider China's insurance market,'' 
the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	China requires all foreign life insurance companies to find  
Chinese partners before they can sell insurance in the country. 
Foreign companies aren't allowed to hold a controlling stake and 
life insurance companies are may only sell individual life 
insurance plans. 
</P>
<P>
	China also limits foreign insurance sales to only two cities -  
Shanghai and Guangzhou. But industry executives say insurance 
regulators are prepared to soon open up to 10 more cities for 
foreign insurers.

<HEADLINE> High Court Clarifies Case Transfers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today clarified the deadline  
for transferring cases from state court to federal court, saying 
the 30-day clock begins to run when someone is formally served and 
receives a copy of a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-3 ruling allows an Illinois company to have a  
breach-of-contract lawsuit against it moved from an Alabama state 
court to a federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the company was faxed a copy of the lawsuit two  
weeks before it was formally served, the 30-day clock did not begin 
to run until formal service was completed, the justices said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law gives defendants 30 days after receiving a lawsuit  
``through service or otherwise'' to transfer it to federal court 
when the parties are from different states. 
</P>
<P>
	Writing for the court, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said  
defendants' time to transfer a case to federal court begins when 
they receive formal service and a copy of the lawsuit, or when they 
receive a copy of the complaint sometime after being formally 
served, ``but not by mere receipt of the complaint unattended by 
any formal service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That ``assures defendants adequate time to decide whether to  
remove an action to federal court,'' Ginsburg wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy Bros. of East Moline, Ill., was sued in Alabama state  
court Jan. 26, 1996, by Michetti Pipe Stringing, based in Nisku, 
Alberta, Canada. Michetti accused Murphy of breaking a contract and 
fraud involving a construction project in Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	Michetti faxed a copy of the lawsuit to Murphy's vice president  
the following Jan. 29. Murphy was formally served with the lawsuit 
by certified mail Feb. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	On the following March 13, Murphy had the case transferred to  
federal court on grounds the companies were from different states. 
It made the request within 30 days after receiving formal service, 
but 44 days after getting the faxed copy of the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Michetti asked a federal judge to return the case to state  
court, saying Murphy waited too long after receiving the lawsuit by 
fax. The judge refused, saying the time limit did not begin to run 
until the case was served by certified mail. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed and sent the  
case back to state court. The clock begins running when someone 
receives a copy of a lawsuit ``by any means,'' the court said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court disagreed. Ginsburg's ruling was joined by

<HEADLINE> Capitol Hill Quiet for Another Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress began the second week of its Easter  
recess Monday, leaving for next week any debate on the U.S. role in 
the growing turmoil in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	While some members of the armed services and intelligence  
committees were in Washington to keep abreast of developments in 
the crisis, neither the House nor Senate were in session or will 
hold hearings this week. 
</P>
<P>
	A schedule drawn up at the beginning of the year had the House  
back in session this week, but new Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., 
revised that to give House members the same two weeks off that the 
Senate is enjoying. The Easter break is commonly used to work in 
home districts or take fact-finding trips around the country or 
abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo is expected to be a major topic when they return next  
Tuesday: Appropriators must make quick decisions about the cost of 
the military mission and whether to pay for it through emergency 
spending or by increasing the fiscal year 2000 defense budget. The 
House and Senate have an April 15 deadline for coming up with a 
plan for the 2000 budget.

	NATO Blasts Serb Targets  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO blasted at Serb targets Monday  
that reportedly included an air force building, army barracks and 
the capital's airport, while the allies planned an airlift of 
ethnic Albanian refugees flooding out of Kosovo province. Amid a 
heavy new wave of airstrikes late Sunday and early Monday across 
Serbia, the United States signaled an escalation of firepower to 
halt Serb attacks on Kosovo's Albanian majority. Washington agreed 
to send 24 Apache helicopter gunships, 2,000 troops and a missile 
launching system to Albania to give NATO the ability to directly 
attack Serb troops and tanks in Kosovo, a province of Serbia, 
Yugoslavia's dominant republic. NATO leaders meeting Monday must 
approve use of the weapons.

	Can Antibiotic Stop Heart Attacks?  
</P>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Researchers hope to find out if taking an  
antibiotic will spare heart patients from future heart attacks, 
bypass surgery or even death. In a federally funded study based on 
growing evidence a common bacterial infection may trigger heart 
attacks and worsen, perhaps even cause, atherosclerosis -- narrowing 
of the arteries from plaque deposits. Given that known risk factors 
for heart disease such as smoking, high cholesterol and high blood 
pressure can't account for many cases, doctors increasingly suspect 
infectious agents may be partly to blame for some of the 1.75 
million heart attacks, bypass surgeries and artery-clearing 
angioplasties in this country each year.

8888 of the United Steelworkers of America, said before the final 
hour. The union, which represents many of the yard's 9,200 hourly

insufficient raises in a proposed new contract. In the new 
contract, the union wants an across-the-board hourly pay increase

<P>
	WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- A thunderstorm caused extensive damage  
today at a school and a nearby shopping area. No serious injuries 
were reported. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate confirmation whether the storm included a  
tornado, the National Weather Service said.

<P>
	``Something went through there with gusto,'' said Conrad Rohr, a  
Wichita resident who saw some of the damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Three portable classrooms in trailers at Jefferson Elementary  
School were destroyed, windows were broken in the main school 
building and teachers' cars were overturned, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighteen children eating breakfast in the school cafeteria were  
moved to a heavily bricked section for protection when warning 
sirens blared. The children were unhurt. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Wizards Fire Coach Bickerstaff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Under Bernie Bickerstaff, the Washington  
Wizards became a tentative, underachieving team that froze in the 
fourth quarter, with little hustle for the big rebound or loose 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
	In danger of missing the playoffs for the 10th time in 11 years  
and struggling at 13-19, the Wizards fired Bickerstaff on Monday 
and replaced him with assistant Jim Brovelli. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt this team wasn't moving in the direction that we  
anticipated,'' said general manager Wes Unseld, whose friendship 
with Bickerstaff dates to the 1970s. ``This is one of the toughest 
decisions that I've had to make, but it was my feeling that a 
change was necessary at this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brovelli will serve as an interim coach for the rest of the  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wizards, who lost 90-79 to Miami on Sunday, are in fifth  
place in the Atlantic Division and not in playoff contention. They 
have one of the best backcourts in the league in Mitch Richmond and 
Rod Strickland and a top forward in Juwan Howard, but lack of a 
quality center. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wizards' real nemesis, however, has been the fourth quarter.  
They have held the lead in 20 of their 31 games after three 
periods, but they've go on to lose nine of those 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``What it boiled down to more than anything was I did not think  
we were a loose and relaxed basketball team,'' guard Tim Legler 
said. ``The atmosphere was very tense, and lot of guys were playing 
very defensive, rather than being aggressive and offensive on the 
court. ... I think that's indicative of what's happened this year 
when we've had close games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bickerstaff sometimes left players confused with his novel  
player rotations. Several times this season he would play a starter 
for five minutes, then bench him for the rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of guys that weren't very relaxed in their role and  
weren't sure exactly what was expected of them on a nightly basis. 
... When you're playing this game, if you're not having fun, you're 
not relaxed, no matter who you're playing against, you're going to 
struggle,'' Legler said. 
</P>
<P>
	As the losses mounted, Bickerstaff admitted he wasn't able to  
get his players to produce the intangibles for a fourth-quarter 
victory. But he also said his club simply wasn't as talented as 
teams such as Miami, something that didn't sit well with his 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a missing ingredient,'' Bickerstaff said after  
Sunday's game. ``And the ingredient is you have to look yourself 
and say, `Do we have the innate ability to do those things?' To me, 
it doesn't take skill, it takes an awareness of what needs to be 
done in terms of, `There's a rebound, a loose ball, I have to get 
it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Bickerstaff's dismissal is the fourth coaching change this  
season, following Del Harris (Lakers), Dave Cowens (Charlotte) and 
John Calipari (New Jersey). 
</P>
<P>
	Bickerstaff was in his 10th season as an NBA coach. His record  
was 338-348, including 77-71 with the Wizards. He began his 
coaching career in Washington in 1973, serving as an assistant 
until 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Bickerstaff's best showing as a coach was in 1987, when he led  
the SuperSonics to the Western Conference finals, one of three 
postseason appearances as Seattle's coach. 
</P>
<P>
	He was lured from his job as general manager of the Denver  
Nuggets and hired by the Wizards after the All-Star break during 
the 1996-97 season, leading Washington to its first postseason 
appearance since 1988. The Wizards were 42-40 last season.

<HEADLINE> Example of How 'Marriage Tax' Works </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An example of how the federal tax code  
penalizes married couples who earn comparable salaries. 

</P>
<P>
	A machinist and a school teacher each earn $31,500 a year, or  
$63,000 combined. 
</P>
<P>
	If single, they can each take a standard deduction and a  
personal exemption totaling $6,950, leaving them with a taxable 
income of $24,550 apiece, subject to a 15 percent tax. 
</P>
<P>
	These typical singles would each pay $3,682 in tax, or $7,364  
combined. 
</P>
<P>
	But if the same machinist and teacher marry, they are subject to  
different tax rates and deductions. 
</P>
<P>
	They can only take $12,500 for the personal exemption and  
standard deduction, leaving them with $50,500 that is partly 
subject to a 28 percent tax rate. 
</P>
<P>
	That means the married pair pays $8,635 in tax -- a ``penalty''  
of $1,271.

<HEADLINE> NAACP Wants Stop to Reunion Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- The NAACP and several black college  
students on Monday asked a federal judge to stop Daytona Beach's 
plans to restrict car access to city beaches during Black College 
Reunion this coming weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The traffic plan denies the rights of equal protection and  
assembly to the 100,000 black students expected for three days of 
beachside revelry, the civil rights group said in an emergency 
filing in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan, which would be implemented if there is heavy  
congestion, allows only residents, hotel guests and those 
conducting business on the beach side of town to have access to the 
beach. All others would have to park their cars and take a shuttle 
to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
	No similar traffic plans were enforced for the 500,000 visitors  
who attend Bike Week or the 150,000 visitors at spring break, said 
Crystal Lewis, a black student at Daytona Beach Community College. 
Those events are mainly attended by white visitors, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Black College Reunion began in 1984 and has drawn up to 100,000  
people who transform the main beachside road into a street party. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's reunion weekend erupted in violence when an Orlando  
man was killed and four police officers were wounded during a 
shootout.

<HEADLINE> 60 Die in Indonesia Religious Riots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesian soldiers found 20 bodies  
Monday in houses that had been burned down by rioters, bringing the 
death toll from days of religious violence in the Spice Islands to 
60 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies, which witnesses said were burned beyond recognition,  
were found in Larat, a village on the island of Kai Besar in Maluku 
province, the Antara news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 250 people have been killed and hundreds of buildings  
burned in Maluku -- most on the island of Ambon -- since bloody 
clashes first erupted between Christians and Muslims in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Fighting broke out in the islands southeast of Ambon on  
Wednesday and has since left 60 dead. The military said two 
Christians were killed by Muslims on Sunday in Tual, near Kai 
Besar, 1,750 miles east of Jakarta. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 13,000 people have already fled their homes, seeking  
shelter in government and military installations in Tual. 
</P>
<P>
	Local military chief Lt. Col. Ery Susanto said the navy would  
send several warships to the region to avert an exodus of 
frightened residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia is the world's most populous Islamic country. Nearly  
90 percent of its 210 million people are Muslims. However, Maluku 
has a large Christian population. 
</P>
<P>
	The violence in Maluku comes amid Indonesia's worst economic  
crisis in decades as well as political uncertainty that has 
followed the resignation of authoritarian President Suharto last 
May. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic and sectarian unrest has broken out in several parts of  
the archipelago nation. Last month more than 200 people were killed 
in ethnic fighting on the island of Borneo. 
</P>
<P>
	Fresh violence broke out Sunday and persisted Monday in Borneo's  
worst hit district, Sambas, Antara reported. Some 17 houses were 
set on fire but there was no immediate report on casualties.

<HEADLINE>  Maine's Hockey Team Returns Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- A cross-country trip was well worthwhile  
for the Maine Black Bears. 
</P>
<P>
	The pep band played and about 100 fans cheered and tossed  
confetti Sunday night as the Maine hockey team returned from 
winning its second NCAA championship this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Angus King embraced Coach Shawn Walsh as the weary team  
disembarked from a plane at the Portland International Jetport 
after traveling back from Anaheim, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an unbelievable weekend,'' said goalie Alfie Michaud,  
who turned away 46 shots during the Black Bears' 3-2 overtime 
victory over New Hampshire in the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans were still basking after the win over the archrival  
Wildcats on Saturday night, secured on Marcus Gustafsson's rebound 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``You couldn't ask for a better game. You couldn't write a  
better story. It was the perfect ending,'' said Terry Tucker, who 
traveled from Dayton to greet the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Mathy Matturro, a Maine student, said she was in tears when the  
Black Bears won. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the puck went through the goal, I was bawling. Can you  
say, `hyperventilating?' '' said Matturro, who is a volunteer 
statistician for the team. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears' triumphant return followed postgame celebrations that  
were marred by rowdiness. Students knocked down the goalposts at 
the football field and lit a bonfire on the mall in the center of 
campus. They tossed in several park benches, door frames and 
screens. About 100 students were involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unclear to me how, but somehow a snowmobile got put into  
it, too,'' said university spokesman Joe Carr. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no arrests on campus. Carr said that most of the  
9,500 students celebrated in an orderly fashion. 
</P>
<P>
	Students and fans were glued to their television sets across the  
state Saturday evening as Maine and New Hampshire went into 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was hoping it would be a blowout, and we wouldn't have to  
put up with the tension,'' senior Ryan Eslinger said Saturday 
night. ``You could just feel the tension in the room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last time Maine won the NCAA championship was in 1993. The  
Bears lost to Boston University in the final in 1995 and were then 
barred from tournament play for two years for NCAA violations that 
resulted in Walsh being suspended. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears were sixth in Hockey East last season before returning  
to championship form. 
</P>
<P>
	``This one shows we're back,'' said Chris White, director of the  
24-member pep band. 
</P>
<P>
	The game carried ramifications beyond the realm of sports and  
into the arena of politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire was on the losing side of a bet  
with Maine Sen. Susan Collins. Because the Wildcats lost, he must 
sing the Maine fight song for the Maine State Society in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire coach Dick Umile had no complaint with his  
players' effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a great college hockey game,'' he said. ``These were  
two teams that deserved to be here. Unfortunately, they just got 
one more goal than we did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maine goalie Alfie Michaud, honored as the outstanding player of  
the Final Four, stopped 46 shots, and New Hampshire's Ty Conklin 
stopped 36, with each goalie coming up with spectacular saves. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was great goaltending on both sides,'' Umile said.  
</P>
<P>
	Added Walsh: ``Both of them are terrific goalies. I told Ty  
after the game that he'd be back in a game like this.''

<HEADLINE> Government To Honor Cold War Vets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It was a different kind of conflict, a 46-year  
face-down between adversaries with enough weapons to destroy the 
world but never willing to use them against each other. Its end 
brought no peace treaty, no parade of heroes. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Cold War was a war, the United States won, and the  
victors were ignored, Army veteran Mark Vogl insisted. 
</P>
<P>
	So Vogl began a letter-writing, signature-gathering crusade in  
1994 from his Bay Shore home on New York's Long Island to get 
recognition for the men and women who served. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, his efforts are being rewarded.  
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Department will begin taking applications from those  
who served during the Cold War for a ``Cold War Recognition 
Certificate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``All members of the armed forces and federal government  
civilian personnel who faithfully served the United States during 
the Cold War era'' are eligible, a Pentagon Web site said. 
</P>
<P>
	It also specifies the dates: Sept. 2, 1945, the date Japan  
surrendered after World War II, to Dec. 26, 1991, when Mikhail 
Gorbachev resigned as Soviet president and the Soviet Union was 
disbanded. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 22 million people meet the eligibility  
requirements. An application letter with a document proving service 
during the period is enough to show the applicant served honorably, 
the Pentagon Web site said. 
</P>
<P>
	The certificate is symbolic. No financial reward is involved.  
</P>
<P>
	But Vogl, 43, said it goes a long way toward showing the role of  
those who fought to keep the protagonists at bay as the United 
States and the Soviet Union raced to pump up their nuclear 
arsenals. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is probably the most significant human event since we've  
been alive,'' Vogl said of the Cold War. ``There was no nuclear 
war, Germany was reunited, the possibility of a European 
confederation all of a sudden becomes a real possibility. The whole 
world is different now because of what happened then. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it just sort of went away.''  
</P>
<P>
	Vogl began his lobbying effort with a Cold War recognition  
resolution to his county's chapter of the veterans' group AMVETS. 
The resolution passed and sailed through national AMVET 
ratification at the group's annual convention in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Vogl, whose wife worked for Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., approached  
the congressman about sponsoring legislation. Lazio jumped on 
board, and the recognition gesture was written into the 1997 
defense budget to take effect this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``America's victory in the Cold War was too much like winning  
the World Series in an empty stadium,'' Lazio said. ``There was no 
ticker tape parade, ... yet the people who represented our 
country's military during this period are responsible for a huge 
victory over the Soviet Union that saved mankind from nuclear 
holocaust.''

<HEADLINE> 'Junior' Gotti Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- John A. ``Junior'' Gotti, the son and  
alleged successor of America's best-known Mafioso, pleaded guilty 
today to racketeering, bribery, extortion and other charges in 
exchange for a prison term of up to seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	The plea was entered the day before jury selection was to begin  
in his federal trial. Gotti also was fined $1 million and must 
forfeit $1 million in cash and property that prosecutors say are 
proceeds from his criminal ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Gotti could have been sentenced to 15 years in  
prison and fined millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the younger Gotti was accused of succeeding his father,  
John J. Gotti, at the top of the Gambino crime family after the 
elder Gotti was sent to prison for life in 1992, the case against 
him didn't allege any of the violence associated with the elder 
Gotti. 
</P>
<P>
	Gotti was charged with taking part in a criminal enterprise  
known as the Gambino family, and extortion, robbery, loansharking, 
gambling and bribery. Many of the charges stemmed from an alleged 
extortion scheme at the Manhattan topless club Scores. 
</P>
<P>
	``I conspired with a group of individuals forming an  
association,'' Gotti told Judge Barrington Parker, although he did 
not mention the Gambino family by name. 
</P>
<P>
	He admitted bribing a union official, conspiring with others to  
commit extortion, supervising illegal gambling activities and 
filing a false income tax return. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said the sentence ``substantially  
weakens the Gambino crime family as a major force in organized 
crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gotti, 35, entered the plea after learning that federal  
prosecutors in Brooklyn had planned to indict him on income tax and 
loansharking charges, said defense attorney Gerald Shargel. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government was putting Mr. Gotti in a position where he  
had no choice,'' Shargel said. He said Gotti pleaded guilty to 
bring ``finality and closure'' to the prosecutions. Among the 
charges he pleaded guilty to were the new loansharking charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Gotti, who remains free on $10 million bail, said nothing as he  
exited the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Sentencing was scheduled for July 8. Prosecutors said the term  
will range between five years and ten months, and seven years and 
two months. Defense attorneys said they will not challenge the 
judge's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	In the entire federal indictment against ``Junior,'' there was  
no mention of murder. No cement shoes, no sleeping with the fishes, 
no kiss on the lips followed by a bullet to the head. There wasn't 
even any leg-breaking. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not that kind of mob case,'' said Ronald Goldstock,  
former director of the state Organized Crime Task Force. ``You 
might not get those much anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So many Mafia leaders are in prison and so many mobsters are  
willing to cooperate that it's difficult now to carry out ``the 
kind of blatant criminal activity people associate with organized 
crime,'' Goldstock said. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge had ordered a jury pool of 400. But he turned down a  
prosecution request that the jurors' names be kept secret, saying 
none of the charges involve the sort of violence that warrants an 
anonymous jury. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Gotti, known as the Teflon Don for avoiding conviction  
in three trials, was finally found guilty in 1992 in a racketeering 
case that alleged five murders -- including that of his predecessor, 
Paul Castellano -- and featured the Mafia's highest-ranking 
turncoat, Salvatore ``Sammy the Bull'' Gravano. 
</P>
<P>
	If the younger Gotti's case is less glamorous, so is the  
defendant himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``Junior,'' whose father also was called the Dapper Don for his  
fine suits and silvery hair, has gone to court in sneakers and 
jeans. Unlike his swaggering father, he rushes past the cameras and 
talks to reporters in half-sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier on Monday, Gotti said of his impending trial: ``I'm  
excited. It's like my first day of school. It's like I'm starting 
kindergarten again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Gotti asked to be jailed during the trial so he  
wouldn't have to pay the $24,000 monthly cost of round-the-clock 
security guards that were a condition of his release on bail. He 
withdrew that request Monday because the judge ruled that he didn't 
have to pay for guards during the trial.

<HEADLINE>  Maine's Hockey Team Returns Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- A cross-country trip was well worthwhile  
for the Maine Black Bears. 
</P>
<P>
	The pep band played and about 100 fans cheered and tossed  
confetti Sunday night as the Maine hockey team returned from 
winning its second NCAA championship this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Angus King embraced Coach Shawn Walsh as the weary team  
disembarked from a plane at the Portland International Jetport 
after traveling back from Anaheim, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an unbelievable weekend,'' said goalie Alfie Michaud,  
who turned away 46 shots during the Black Bears' 3-2 overtime 
victory over New Hampshire in the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans were still basking after the win over the archrival  
Wildcats on Saturday night, secured on Marcus Gustafsson's rebound 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``You couldn't ask for a better game. You couldn't write a  
better story. It was the perfect ending,'' said Terry Tucker, who 
traveled from Dayton to greet the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Mathy Matturro, a Maine student, said she was in tears when the  
Black Bears won. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the puck went through the goal, I was bawling. Can you  
say, `hyperventilating?' '' said Matturro, who is a volunteer 
statistician for the team. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears' triumphant return followed postgame celebrations that  
were marred by rowdiness. Students knocked down the goalposts at 
the football field and lit a bonfire on the mall in the center of 
campus. They tossed in several park benches, door frames and 
screens. About 100 students were involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unclear to me how, but somehow a snowmobile got put into  
it, too,'' said university spokesman Joe Carr. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no arrests on campus. Carr said that most of the  
9,500 students celebrated in an orderly fashion. 
</P>
<P>
	Students and fans were glued to their television sets across the  
state Saturday evening as Maine and New Hampshire went into 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was hoping it would be a blowout, and we wouldn't have to  
put up with the tension,'' senior Ryan Eslinger said Saturday 
night. ``You could just feel the tension in the room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last time Maine won the NCAA championship was in 1993. The  
Bears lost to Boston University in the final in 1995 and were then 
barred from tournament play for two years for NCAA violations that 
resulted in Walsh being suspended. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears were sixth in Hockey East last season before returning  
to championship form. 
</P>
<P>
	``This one shows we're back,'' said Chris White, director of the  
24-member pep band. 
</P>
<P>
	The game carried ramifications beyond the realm of sports and  
into the arena of politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire was on the losing side of a bet  
with Maine Sen. Susan Collins. Because the Wildcats lost, he must 
sing the Maine fight song for the Maine State Society in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire coach Dick Umile had no complaint with his  
players' effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a great college hockey game,'' he said. ``These were  
two teams that deserved to be here. Unfortunately, they just got 
one more goal than we did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maine goalie Alfie Michaud, honored as the outstanding player of  
the Final Four, stopped 46 shots, and New Hampshire's Ty Conklin 
stopped 36, with each goalie coming up with spectacular saves. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was great goaltending on both sides,'' Umile said.  
</P>
<P>
	Added Walsh: ``Both of them are terrific goalies. I told Ty  
after the game that he'd be back in a game like this.''

<HEADLINE> Defendants Have Right to Silence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Judges cannot heap stiffer punishment on  
criminal defendants who, after pleading guilty, refuse to give 
details about the crime at sentencing, the Supreme Court said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Holding such defendants' silence against them would impose ``an  
impermissible burden on the exercise of the constitutional right 
against compelled self-incrimination,'' the court ruled 5-4 in a 
Pennsylvania drug case. 
</P>
<P>
	The Constitution's Fifth Amendment states that no one ``shall be  
compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.'' 
In 1965, the nation's highest court ruled that criminal trial 
juries cannot hold defendants' silence against them. 
</P>
<P>
	Writing for the court on Monday, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy  
said, ``Treating a guilty plea as a waiver of the privilege at 
sentencing would be a grave encroachment on the rights of 
defendants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That would let prosecutors indict someone in a drug case without  
specifying the amount of drugs involved, obtain a guilty plea and 
then use the defendant's testimony at sentencing to establish the 
amount of drugs, Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The result would be to enlist the defendant as an instrument  
in his or her own condemnation,'' he said. He added, however, that 
the justices were not deciding whether such defendants' silence at 
sentencing could be viewed as showing a lack of remorse. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy's opinion was joined by Justices John Paul Stevens,  
David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Dissenting were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices  
Antonin Scalia, Sandra Day O'Connor and Clarence Thomas. They 
agreed that defendants who plead guilty can refuse to testify at 
sentencing, but said judges should be allowed to hold it against 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no reason why the Fifth Amendment should shield a  
defendant ``from the natural and appropriate consequences of her 
uncooperativeness at the sentencing stage,'' Scalia wrote for the 
dissenters. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's ruling reversed a lower court decision that said  
defendants who plead guilty forfeit the right to remain silent at 
their sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
	Amanda Mitchell of Allentown, Pa., invoked that right in  
refusing to testify at a sentencing hearing about the extent of her 
involvement in a cocaine-selling ring. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell was charged along with 22 other people. She pleaded  
guilty in 1995 to federal charges of conspiracy and distributing 
cocaine, but she reserved the question of her level of culpability 
for the amount of cocaine she actually distributed. 
</P>
<P>
	At her sentencing, Mitchell refused to answer when the judge  
asked about her level of involvement. The judge sentenced her to 10 
years in prison, saying the testimony of other witnesses 
established that she had distributed more than 13 kilograms of 
cocaine over a two-year period. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge specifically said he drew a negative inference from  
Mitchell's refusal to discuss details of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``I held it against you that you didn't come forward today,''  
the judge said, adding that Mitchell had no Fifth Amendment right 
to remain silent because she waived that right when pleading 
guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed, saying she lacked  
constitutional protection even though her refusal to testify 
created a risk of harsher punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court reversed. ``The government retains the burden  
of proving facts relevant to the crime at the sentencing phase and 
cannot enlist the defendant in this process at the expense of the 
self-incrimination privilege,'' Kennedy wrote.

<HEADLINE> Crude Up, Coffee Down  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crude and its products advanced Monday on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange after U.N. officials said American airstrikes 
on Iraqi targets last week may have damaged a pipeline delivering 
oil. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, coffee futures fell sharply, while beef and  
pork futures rose sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude edged closer to their highest levels in a year after oil  
experts for the United Nations, which is overseeing the sale of 
Iraqi oil for humanitarian purposes, reported there was a drop in 
flow from the Bazarkan oil fields. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq previously had said missile attacks from British and  
American planes in the southern no-fly zone of that country had 
damaged a pipeline control center, although the Clinton 
administration denied any pipeline damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq reported the pipeline operating as of Saturday, but experts  
said it was operating Monday at least 45 percent below normal 
capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	A slowdown in shipments from Iraq would come at a time when  
other OPEC members are moving to reduce daily output in a bid to 
push prices per barrel above $17. Such a sustained rally would put 
prices at their highest in more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude and unleaded gasoline prices have risen at the fastest  
rate since the Gulf War on those moves. Refinery problems on the 
West Coast have also contributed to the increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Light, sweet crude for May delivery rose 31 cents from trading  
Thursday to $16.95 barrel; May unleaded gasoline rose .88 cent to 
53.98 cents a gallon; May heating oil rose .62 cent to 44.02 cents 
a gallon; May natural gas fell .008 cent to $2.030 for each 1,000 
cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee futures tumbled more than 2 percent on the Board of Trade  
of the City of New York as fresh supplies from producers continued 
to arrive at a time when consumption levels generally decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee prices had rebounded recently as roasters took advantage  
of prices at their lowest in nearly three years to replenish 
inventories, but those gains now have led to diminished buying even 
as new supplies of stored Latin American crops roll in. 
</P>
<P>
	May arabica coffee fell 2.75 cents to $1.073 a pound.  
</P>
<P>
	Beef and pork futures moved strongly higher on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange amid expectations the Clinton administration 
soon will begin buying meat and livestock for donation to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has pledged 150,000 tons of beef and 50,000 tons  
of pork to aid cash-strapped Russia in a move that also was meant 
to help producers slash large surpluses that grew over the winter. 
</P>
<P>
	But Chuck Levitt, an analyst at Alaron Trading Corp., noted the  
purchase now will come at a time when supplies are tightest. Demand 
typically rises sharply around this time of year as Americans begin 
the outdoor grilling season. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle rose .55 cent to 67.65 cents a pound; May  
feeder cattle rose 1.10 cents to 74 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
rose 1.15 cents to 54.10 cents a pound; July pork bellies rose .60 
cent to 52.30 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Salon Magazine Undergoes Makeover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The online magazine Salon, an Internet  
pioneer, is undergoing a makeover, obtaining the desirable domain 
address of www.salon.com from a beauty salon owner. 
</P>
<P>
	The new address is one of several changes being announced today  
by Salon, which is published by Salon Internet Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	David Talbot, Salon's editor and founder, said the magazine  
plans an expansion into breaking news. It will also be introducing 
two new sections, focusing on health and people. Obituaries and a 
daily gossip column are being added. The magazine has hired 20 
employees and is opening an office in Washington, D.C., with two 
staff reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Talbot said the domain name is key to revitalizing the  
publication. 
</P>
<P>
	Salon magazine had been residing at three Internet addresses --  
www.salon1999.com, www.salonmagazine.com and www.salon.net -- since 
its November 1995 debut. 
</P>
<P>
	But many potential readers expected to find the magazine at  
www.salon.com. Instead, they found themselves at a Web site owned 
by Roy Frederickson, who owns two beauty salons in Austin, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Talbot finally persuaded Frederickson to sell his domain name  
for a promise of stock, an undisclosed sum of cash and the 
salon.net domain. On Salon magazine's new home page, there is a 
link to Frederickson's page. 
</P>
<P>
	Talbot is counting not only on the new address but on a national  
advertising campaign, a newly designed site and a larger staff to 
help attract visitors to the publication. With the old address, 
Salon had been attracting 1.2 million visitors a month, according 
to Talbot. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Francisco-based magazine posted revenue of $3.5 million  
in its fiscal year ended April 1, derived largely from advertising. 
Talbot said Salon was not yet profitable. 
</P>
<P>
	Salon attracted controversy last September when it reported that  
Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the chairman of the House Judiciary 
Committee who would lead the impeachment effort against President 
Clinton, had once been involved in an extramarital affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan Broder, the magazine's Washington bureau chief,  
resigned over the magazine's decision to reveal the affair. He said 
at the time that ``there was no public issue involved'' in Hyde's 
conduct. Many news organizations knew of allegations about an 
affair dating to Hyde's career before Congress, but decided against 
a story.

<HEADLINE> 'The Matrix' Debuts Atop Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The special effects-ladden action movie ``The  
Matrix,'' debuted atop the weekend box office, grossing $27.6 
million for the biggest opening weekend this year, industry 
estimates showed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Matrix,'' starring Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne,  
came out ahead of two other newcomers, ``10 Things I Hate About 
You'' and ``The Out-Of-Towners.'' It also was the best opening for 
Reeves since 1994, when ``Speed'' took in $14.5 million at its 
debut. 
</P>
<P>
	``10 Things I Hate About You,'' an updated, teen-centered  
version of the Shakespearean classic ``The Taming of the Shrew,'' 
was a distant second with $8.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Out-Of-Towners,'' a loose remake of the 1970 comedy about  
an out-of-town couple in New York City, starring Steve Martin and 
Goldie Hawn, was third with $8.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Analyze This'' and ``Forces of Nature'' tied for fourth with  
$6.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``EDtv,'' about a video store clerk who agrees to let television  
capture every minute of his life, dropped from third to sixth place 
after losing 45 percent of its audience in its second week. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Oscar winners remained in the top 10. ``Shakespeare in  
Love'' was seventh with $3.3 million, while ``Life is Beautiful'' 
was No. 9 with $2.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doug's 1st Movie'' was eighth with $3.1 million. ``The Mod  
Squad'' clung to the top 10 with $2.4 million after losing 60 
percent of its audience in its second week. 
</P>
<P>
	The top 12 films grossed an estimated $77.1 million over the  
weekend, slightly higher than the same weekend last year when 
``Titanic'' was still going strong. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated grosses for Friday through Sunday at North American  
theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final figures 
to be released today: 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``The Matrix,'' $27.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``10 Things I Hate About You,'' $8.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``The Out-Of-Towners,'' $8.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. (tie) ``Analyze This,'' $6.3 million.

<HEADLINE> Tornado Kills Six in Louisiana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BENTON, La. (AP) -- Carrying an armful of hats from the wreckage  
of her house trailer, Hattie Turner glanced nervously over her 
shoulder at dark clouds forming on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to ever see a storm again,'' she said Sunday, a  
day after her home was destroyed by a deadly tornado that ripped 
through northwest Louisiana. ``I don't want to hear the wind or see 
it rain. It's too scary now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turner was one of hundreds of people who lost their homes  
Saturday as the tornado passed through, ripping up trees and 
tossing trailers in this northwest Louisiana community. 
</P>
<P>
	Six people died, and at least nine others remained hospitalized  
Sunday in critical or guarded condition, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, ``we have at least another 100 of what I call  
walking wounded. People that were hurt but didn't need to be 
hospitalized,'' said Bossier Parish Sheriff Larry Deen. 
</P>
<P>
	The tornado, believed to be about a half-mile wide, curved  
through farm and rural land, hitting two mobile home parks as well 
as the upscale subdivision of Palmetto Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Marilyn Duckwater said the tornado -- packing winds of 207 to 260  
mph -- roared in with an unbelievable force, reducing her 
three-bedroom brick house to a pile of soggy rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	``My ears popped, you couldn't even hear the walls or trees  
falling because of the roar of the wind. I can't believe anyone 
survived it,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents scrambled to pick up what they could before darkness  
fell because utility companies still hadn't hooked up the water, 
gas and electricity that was cut off a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``You pick up what you can, see what's left and go on,'' Ken  
Anderson said after surveying the damage to his subdivision. ``It's 
mostly small stuff. Anything big is gone or ruined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lisa Moore's family members stacked a few pieces of furniture  
that once adorned her trailer house. Her mother had already 
salvaged more precious goods, clutching two mud-spattered snapshots 
and a rosary that had belonged to her 25-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore, who was five months pregnant, died when the trailer  
flipped upside down. The twister ripped away the walls, scattering 
the contents across roads and into shrubs and tree branches. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were going to find out if she was going to have a girl or  
boy on Monday,'' said Linda Turner, Moore's step-grandmother. ``Now 
we're just looking for little pieces here and there so we can have 
something left to hold onto.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Christina Harrison, 14, died not far from Moore's house.  
Neighbors said she was sitting on a couch when the storm demolished 
the trailer she lived in. 
</P>
<P>
	The others killed were identified as Betty Dyal, 60, of Benton;  
Kenneth Hewitt, 53, of Bossier City; John L. Taylor, 65, of Waldo, 
Ark.; and Michael Andrews, 41, of Shreveport. 
</P>
<P>
	About 6 p.m. another tornado uprooted trees in rural Taylortown,  
about 20 miles southeast of Benton, emergency officials said. There 
were no reports of injuries or damage. Tornado watches remained in 
effect into the evening for most of north Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	To make matters worse, torrential rain storms hit the area  
Sunday night, flooding streets and submerging cars in Shreveport 
and Bossier City. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials closed Interstate 20 at Dixie Inn, about 20 miles west  
of Shreveport, because the highway was under water. There were no 
immediate reports of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Mazziotti, director of the Bossier Parish Office of  
Emergency Preparedness, said the threat of destruction wasn't over. 
Officials were worried about another band of strong storms expected 
to reach northwest Louisiana by this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``You see this on television and you think, `Wow, those poor  
people,''' said Tom Miles as he looked at the toppled walls of his 
house. ``Then you turn off the TV and forget it. We're the ones in 
those sad pictures now.''

<HEADLINE> Sosa Set to Start Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Sammy Sosa is starting where he left off last  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Cubs star hit his final 1998 home run against the  
Houston Astros' Jose Lima in the Astrodome last Sept. 25, giving 
him a 66-65 lead over Mark McGwire in the race for the home record. 
McGwire then hit five in his final three games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year I was ready, but I think in 1999 I am more ready  
because a lot of people are expecting me and Mark to come back and 
do the same way and I'm really ready to see this through,'' Sosa 
said today as the Cubs and Astros prepared for Tuesday night's 
game, the final season opener in the Astrodome. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa looks muscled up this spring and hit a major league-high 12  
homers, three more than McGwire and Seattle's Russ Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	``My last home run was here last year and tomorrow we start  
again,'' Sosa said, ``but last year is over and I want to start 
again, and have a great year. I have to say that he's ready and I'm 
ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For another record?  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to say it's not going to happen,'' Sosa said.  
``It could happen or it could not. Right now, we're just trying to 
get ready for the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa will face Astros ace Shane Reynolds (19-8, 3.51 ERA last  
season). Steve Trachsel (15-8, 4.46) will start for the Cubs, 
shaken during spring training with the season-ending injury to 
Kerry Wood. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sosa seems pretty hot right now,'' Astros manager Larry  
Dierker said. ``That's the way we left him in September. I'm not 
sure if there's ever a good time to face him but I'm satisfied to 
be facing the Cubs and Brewers this homestand. It gives us a 
preview as far as what we're up against.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Sosa added some weight during the offseason, Cubs manager  
Jim Riggleman thinks it may help. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was by design,'' Riggleman said. ``He maintained  
his strength last year. He felt in previous years he lost weight 
during the season. Last year he maintained it and felt that was the 
formula for success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Sosa hit for average, he trailed McGwire 24-9 in the home  
run, before hitting 20 in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa led just twice -- 48-47 on Aug. 19 and on Sept. 25, when  
Lima surrendered No. 66 to his countryman. Sosa won't get a shot at 
Lima (16-8, 3.70) until Thursday night. Sosa hit four homers 
against the Astros last season, including three off Lima. 
</P>
<P>
	``You look at lineups these days, and the top two guys are the  
McGwires and Sosas coming off last year,'' Reynolds said. ``But 
there are guys all over on every team that you have to watch. With 
these guys, you've got to take them more serious but other guys can 
get you too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lima allowed 34 homers in all, the fourth-highest total in the  
NL. After he gave up Nos. 50 and 51 at Wrigley Field on Aug. 23, 
there was a published report questioning whether Lima grooved a 
pitch for the Cubs star. Both players denied the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll try not to let him hit any more home runs off me; then  
they can't say I grooved it for him,'' Lima said. ``I hope I can 
strike him out three times Thursday and then everyone will have to 
keep his mouth shut.''

<HEADLINE>  Libya Suspects Arrive in Netherlands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- Clearing the way for a trial after  
years of defiance, Libya today handed over two suspects in the 1988 
bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
	The surrender of alleged former intelligence agents Abdel Basset  
Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah means the two men can be 
tried in the Netherlands under Scottish law on charges of planting 
the suitcase bomb that blew up Pan Am Flight 103. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dec. 21, 1988, bombing killed 270 people -- including 189  
Americans -- and led to U.N. sanctions that have isolated Libya from 
the West for the past seven years. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi 
Annan said today he was sending a letter to the Security Council 
president that would trigger the suspension of those sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	``This development marks a vital step forward in what has been a  
long ordeal for all involved, especially for the families of the 
victims, who have suffered an irreparable loss,'' Annan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspects surrendered after intense lobbying by South African  
President Nelson Mandela and Saudi Arabian and U.N. officials. 
Libya promised last month to turn over the men by Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Accompanied by U.N. legal chief Hans Corell, who witnessed the  
handover in the Libyan capital, Tripoli, the pair arrived at the 
Valkenburg military airport in The Hague. They were to be held in a 
prison there or in the port city of Rotterdam pending proceedings 
to extradite them to British custody in the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	Dutch authorities said the extradition process could be  
completed within a week to 10 days, but could take months if the 
suspects decide to fight it. 
</P>
<P>
	Once extradited, the suspects will be arraigned on charges of  
murder, conspiracy to commit murder and violations of international 
aviation laws. They then will be transferred to a cell at Camp 
Zeist, a former U.S. air base near the central Dutch city of 
Utrecht, about 30 miles southeast of Amsterdam, where the trial 
will be held under heavy security. 
</P>
<P>
	The base was under heavy security today, with more than 100  
Scottish police patrolling the grounds, some with attack dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Scottish law, their trial should start 110 days after  
their extradition and arraignment. It is expected to last up to two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial, when it finally gets under way, will make  
international legal history after a decade of doubt that anyone 
would ever be tried for the bombing that killed 259 people in the 
air and 11 people on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said in a statement that he was ``gratified''  
to hear the suspects had arrived in the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	``But most important, today is a day to remember the men and  
women who lost their lives on Pan Am 103. I know their loved ones 
have suffered greatly,'' Clinton said. ``They, too, have labored 
hard to bring justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Families of victims of the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet  
expressed concern Monday that the trial of two Libyans suspects 
will fail to point to the person they believe is responsible for 
the crash -- Moammar Gadhafi. 
</P>
<P>
	``If trying these two is the ultimate goal of this trial, then  
it's a travesty,'' said George Williams, president of Victims of 
Pan Am Flight 103, which represents 160 American families who lost 
relatives in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look for the truth wherever it may lead and we firmly  
believe that this will go all the way to the top of the Libyan 
government -- Moammar Gadhafi,'' he said by telephone from his home 
in Joppa, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	Before leaving Tripoli, the two suspects said they hoped to  
return to their families after being found innocent. They said they 
were leaving Libya of their own accord because they were sure of 
their innocence. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are confident in ourselves,'' said al-Megrahi, 46. ``The  
days will prove that what we are saying is true.'' Fhimah, 42, 
flashed the victory sign and told Arab diplomats: ``We hope to see 
you upon our return.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement from the Foreign Ministry read on Libyan  
television, Libya expressed ``the hope that a negative phase in 
international relations has been resolved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the first time a Scottish court has convened in  
another country and tried a major crime without a jury. Under a 
treaty with the Dutch, part of the base will be considered Scottish 
soil for the duration of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The case also marks the first time the U.N. Security Council has  
imposed sanctions on a sovereign state to force it to surrender two 
of its citizens for trial abroad. Tripoli had long argued the 
suspects could not get a fair trial in Britain or the United 
States.

<HEADLINE> Johnson vs. Brown in Opener Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Coming your way today: the Big Unit and his  
blazing fastball against the sidewinding Georgian and his nasty 
slider. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening day at Dodger Stadium features Randy Johnson of the  
Arizona Diamondbacks against Kevin Brown of the Los Angeles 
Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	A dream matchup, for sure.  
</P>
<P>
	Runs will no doubt be at a premium, just as they were last fall  
when Johnson and Brown squared off in the opener of the NL division 
series between the Houston Astros and San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	The final score? 2-1, Padres.  
</P>
<P>
	``Imagine that,'' Dodgers catcher Todd Hundley said with a  
smile. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to some big bucks, Johnson and Brown have changed teams  
since their last meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brown vs. the Unit; opening day,'' Hundley said. ``It's going  
to be fun. If I was going to go to an opening day, ours is the one 
I'd go to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The game has been a sellout for weeks, and much anticipated  
since Johnson signed a $52.4 million, four-year contract with the 
Diamondbacks on Nov. 30, and Brown became baseball's richest player 
when he signed a $105 million, seven-year deal with the Dodgers 12 
days later. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good for baseball, to have two of the most dominant  
pitchers in the game throw against each other on opening day,'' Los 
Angeles second baseman Eric Young said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never faced him before,'' Dodgers shortstop Mark  
Grudzielanek said of Johnson. ``The biggest thing I think is you 
can't be overwhelmed by him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's easier said than done when the time comes to face the  
6-foot-10 left-hander. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown might not be 6-10, but facing him is no walk in the park,  
either. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no question he's one of the best pitchers in the  
league,'' Grudzielanek said. ``He's tough, he's not making that 
kind of money for nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grudzielanek was speaking about Johnson; he just as easily could  
have been talking about Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	While Johnson has been baseball's dominant left-hander in the  
1990s, mostly with the Seattle Mariners, Brown has been one of the 
toughest right-handers, especially the last three years, when he's 
gone 51-26 with a major league-best 2.33 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, who helped the Florida Marlins and Padres reach the World  
Series in the last two years, was 18-7 with a 2.38 ERA in 1998 and 
could become the first pitcher to appear in three consecutive World 
Series with three different teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, that's his goal for this year.  
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, 10-1 with a 1.28 ERA after the Astros acquired him from  
Seattle last July 31, said he still feels honored to pitch on 
opening day, and expects a playoff-type environment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been in that atmosphere, whether it's been in the  
playoffs or the All-Star games,'' he said. ``I have a job to do and 
I don't get caught up in all of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As far as facing Brown is concerned, Johnson said, ``I've faced  
him once before and just thought it was a very well-pitched game by 
both of us, and I'm imagining it's going to be the same thing on 
opening day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown downplayed the duel.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not pitching against him, although I'll face him at least  
a couple times,'' Brown said. ``I've got to get those other guys 
out. My job's still the same. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks are hoping for significant improvement in just  
their second year of existence, while the retooled Dodgers are 
favored to win the NL West. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm real excited,'' Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said.  
``We've had a great spring. Now, we've got to prove that we're a 
good club.''

<HEADLINE> Cards Put Lankford, Howard on DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Opening day wasn't a thrill for St. Louis  
Cardinals players Ray Lankford and David Howard, who were placed on 
15-day disabled list today. 
</P>
<P>
	Lankford, who hit .293 with 31 homers and 105 RBIs last year,  
has been slow to recover from knee surgery performed in November 
and played only two games as a designated hitter this spring. 
Howard had won the second base job until he pulled a groin muscle 
in his final spring at-bat Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've wanted to start forever and finally was told I was going  
to,'' Howard said. ``Then to do it in the last inning of the last 
spring game, it's really disappointing. I wish I wouldn't have run 
as hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Infielders Placido Polanco and Luis Ordaz, who had been optioned  
to Triple-A Memphis on Saturday, were recalled. They didn't 
actually left the team because the moves had been anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never expect to start a season without problems,'' said  
manager Tony La Russa, who began last year without three starting 
pitchers. ``Right now, even though we've taken a hit or two or 
three, we still have the depth that we can play through it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie J.D. Drew, whose best position is center field, will  
replace Lankford in center for the first week or so. Polanco 
started the opener at second base. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard hit .262 with surprising power this spring -- four homers  
and 10 RBIs in 61 at-bats. He has only 10 homers in 593 career 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	But he's been fragile during his career. This is his eighth  
stint on the disabled list in nine seasons. Last year Howard was on 
the DL twice with a sprained left shoulder and played in only 46 
games, batting .245 with two homers and 12 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	The news wasn't all bad Monday. Shortstop Edgar Renteria, who  
didn't play in a major league spring game due to a bone bruise in 
his right knee, started and batted leadoff.

<HEADLINE> Fish Farming on the Rise in Wis. / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WAUSAU, Wis. (AP) -- Wisconsin's rural landscape is dominated by  
corn fields, silos and dairy farms. But experts say the fastest 
growing sector of the agriculture industry uses tanks, ponds and 
nets. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of fish raised on Wisconsin farms are expected to grow  
nearly 60 percent within five years, in part because the state's 
tradition of Friday fish fries has created a demand for perch 
fillets. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is an industry bulging at the seams to grow. The existing  
farms now are not going to be able to keep up with the demand,'' 
said David Gallon, president of the Wisconsin Aquaculture 
Association. ``Five years ago, people didn't know where to sell 
trout in Wisconsin. Five years later, they can't produce enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A decade ago, Wisconsin had about 150 fish farms. Today, the  
state has about 265 that produce fish for food, bait and 
restocking, said Bud Sholts, director of aquaculture development 
for the state Agriculture Department. About 35 to 40 more are being 
developed and should begin production within a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Surveys suggest production will grow 11 percent in each of the  
next five years, Sholts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You wouldn't believe the interest. I get 40 requests a month  
just to start up,'' he said. ``They range all the way from, 
`Grandpa left me $10 million after taxes,' to entrepreneurs in 
other businesses to farmers that want a second profit center.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Myron Kebus, a veterinarian who worked with the aquaculture  
industry in private practice before joining the state Agriculture 
Department, called aquaculture a ``maturing industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Wisconsin, 62 percent of the fish farms report less than  
$10,000 in gross sales and only 2 percent of the total sales, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is tremendous demand, tremendous potential and there are  
also tremendous challenges,'' Kebus said. ``A lot of people are 
looking at this as an easier form of farming, and I don't know that 
I would say that is a reasonable statement. Fish farmers I know who 
are successful work very hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Libbin started Paragon Aquaculture near Oshkosh in 1995  
and markets about 1,000 pounds of yellow perch each month to 
clients primarily in the Fox Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our niche market is white-tablecloth restaurants,'' he said.  
``Not everybody can afford our product, so we go to those that are 
a little higher end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Libbon said the annual demand in Wisconsin for yellow perch tops  
30 million pounds. Commercially, about 10 million pounds are raised 
on farms or netted from the Great Lakes. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Flyers' Lindros Still in Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Doctors won't know until midweek when  
hospitalized Flyers captain Eric Lindros can return to 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	And it will take several more days to determine if his collapsed  
lung mends fast enough to let him skate in the playoffs that start 
in less than three weeks, Flyers team physician Dr. Gary Dorshimer 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorshimer said those answers depend on what happens after  
doctors at Nashville's Baptist Hospital discontinue the suction in 
a tube in Lindros' chest to determine if the lung can remain 
inflated without the assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	Still in pain from the injury, Lindros had hoped to return for  
the playoffs, refusing to ``rule anything out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though there was speculation Lindros was injured when hit during  
the Flyers' 2-1 win Thursday night at Nashville, he said he felt 
pain but didn't think it was serious. ``I went out and had a 
cheeseburger and fries,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later Thursday and early Friday, Dorshimer said Lindros  
experienced ``a progressive feeling of weakness, tiredness and 
shortness of breath and then eventually lightheadedness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the lightheadedness, a Flyers spokesman disputed a USA  
Today report Monday that Lindros had collapsed in his Nashville 
hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is a matter of semantics. I don't think he  
collapsed, but he was taken by ambulance'' to the hospital, team 
spokesman Joe Klueg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros felt chest pains Friday. Roommate Keith Jones told The  
Philadelphia Inquirer that Lindros was ``a hurtin' pup'' by the 
time Jones called Flyers trainer John Worley, who called the 
ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorshimer said Lindros did not appear to have a broken rib or  
punctured lung, but apparently broke a blood vessel. Blood seeping 
into his chest cavity caused his right lung to collapse.

<HEADLINE> Fujitsu, Hitachi Plan Super-Thin TVs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Fujitsu Ltd. and Hitachi Ltd. will set up a joint  
venture company to make plasma display panels for super-thin 
televisions, a media report said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The venture will make a 50-inch thin television targeted at the  
consumer market from next year, the Nihon Keizai newspaper reported 
in its evening edition. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies will share the cost of building a plant to  
produce the high-resolution displays, which would employ around 800 
workers -- with about 700 of them coming from Fujitsu, the paper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fujitsu, one of Japan's biggest electronics companies, was the  
first in the world to begin making plasma displays in 1996 and now 
manufactures about 10,000 panels a month at a plant in northern 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitachi was planning to get into the business on its own later  
this year but the companies decided to join together to reduce 
costs, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fujitsu's existing plasma TV operations will become a wholly  
owned subsidiary of the new company. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitachi and Fujitsu spokesmen confirmed they would make a joint  
announcement regarding plasma display panels on Tuesday but refused 
to provide further details. 
</P>
<P>
	High prices for plasma TVs -- 42-50 inch models cost between 1  
million ($8,300) and 2.5 million ($20,800) -- have kept them out of 
reach of most consumers so far. The thin televisions are currently 
used mostly for advertising in airports, railway stations and 
department stores. 
</P>
<P>
	The new joint-venture company aims to sell the 50-inch model to  
ordinary consumers for about 500,000 yen ($4,150), the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The global market for plasma displays is expected to grow from  
some 70 billion yen ($583 million) in the fiscal year ended in 
March to more than 1 trillion ($8.3 billion) by fiscal year 2005, 
according to Nomura Research Institute Ltd.

<HEADLINE> US Finds Stainless Steel Is Dumped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration moved a step closer  
to slapping punitive tariffs on Japan, Spain and four other 
countries Monday with a ruling that they illegally price some 
stainless steel in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Shipments of stainless round wire from those countries would be  
subject to tariffs of as much as 36 percent if an independent 
fact-finding agency determines that their pricing practices have 
injured or could injure U.S. producers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department ruling represents the latest in a string  
of victories for the U.S. steel industry, which has yet to lose a 
key ruling in trade complaints filed to combat low-priced imports. 
</P>
<P>
	Those successes paradoxically have made it more difficult for  
domestic producers to put foreign steel products under quotas or 
stronger sanctions to fend off imports blamed for thousands of 
layoffs and bankruptcies at three U.S. companies. Administration 
officials cite the favorable rulings as evidence the normal 
administrative process works. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten U.S. manufacturers sought tariffs a year ago, accusing  
Canada, India, Japan, South Korea, Spain and Taiwan of dumping 
round wire in the U.S. market at prices below production costs or 
home-market prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Stainless steel round wire, used to produce springs, wire rope  
and fasteners in construction and other applications, represents a 
small portion of the overall steel industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Monday's dumping determination by the Commerce  
Department adds to relief the U.S. steel industry could get in 
response to the import surge. 
</P>
<P>
	A crucial decision covering the most common steel product,  
hot-rolled carbon steel, is due this month. The Commerce Department 
already has found evidence of dumping by Japan, Russia and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan and Brazil face steel tariffs in the hot-rolled case,  
while Russia has agreed to curb exports instead of similar tariffs. 
A U.S. comment period for implementing the Russian agreement closed 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. International Trade Commission is to rule by mid-May on  
whether round wire dumping has or could hurt the U.S. industry. 
That's the last step before tariffs are imposed. 
</P>
<P>
	Tariffs proposed by the Commerce Department ranged from 3  
percent for stainless round wire from South Korea to 36 percent for 
the product from Spain's main producer. Japanese round wire could 
be subject to tariffs of up to 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Stainless steel round wire is a $300 million-a-year domestic  
industry, and imports add another $100 million, industry officials 
said. Shipments from the six countries under Commerce Department 
scrutiny account for one-third of all imports. 
</P>
<P>
	The government already has imposed tariffs on stainless wire  
rod, the precursor to round wire, and has found six countries 
guilty of dumping stainless plates in coils, which could lead to 
more tariffs if injury is proven. Other complaints are pending. 
</P>
<P>
	The cases acted on Monday were filed by ACS Industries Inc. of  
Woonsocket, R.I.; Al Tech Specialty Steel Corp. of Dunkirk, N.Y.; 
Branford Wire &AMP; Manufacturing Co. of Mountain Home, N.C.; Carpenter 
Technology Corp. of Reading, Pa.; Handy &AMP; Herman Specialty Wire 
Group of Cockeysville, Md; Industrial Alloys Inc. of Pomona, Calif; 
Loos &AMP; Co. Inc. of Pomfret, Conn.; Sandvik Steel Co. of Clarks 
Summit, Pa.; Sumiden Wire Products Corp. of Stockton, Calif.; and 
Techalloy Co. Inc. of Mahwah, N.J.

<HEADLINE> Wizards Fire Coach Bickerstaff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Under Bernie Bickerstaff, the Washington  
Wizards became a tentative, underachieving team that froze in the 
fourth quarter. A team lacking the needed hustle for coming up with 
the big rebound or loose ball. 
</P>
<P>
	In danger of missing the playoffs for the 10th time in 11 years  
and struggling at 13-19, the Wizards fired Bickerstaff on Monday 
and replaced him on an interim basis with assistant Jim Brovelli. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very difficult. It was something I didn't want to do  
today, but I felt I had to,'' said general manager Wes Unseld, 
whose friendship with Bickerstaff dates to the 1970s, when Unseld 
played in Washington and Bickerstaff was an assistant coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way we were going, philosophically maybe, my thinking was  
different. It just wasn't happening, and it didn't seem to change. 
With 18 games left and a chance to still be in this thing, I 
decided to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unseld said he would start contacting coaching candidates  
immediately, although he did not rule out Brovelli as a long-term 
solution. Brovelli, 57, was 1-1 in his NBA head coaching debut 
earlier this season when Bickerstaff was out with the flu. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes it harder because it's Bernie,'' said Brovelli, who  
wouldn't comment directly on whether he's interested in keeping the 
job. ``He gave me the first opportunity to coach in the league. I'm 
going to miss him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Wizards, who lost 90-79 to Miami on Sunday, are in fifth  
place in the Atlantic Division and not in playoff contention. They 
have one of the best backcourts in the league in Mitch Richmond and 
Rod Strickland and a top forward in Juwan Howard, but lack a 
quality center. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wizards' real nemesis, however, has been the fourth quarter.  
They have held the lead in 20 of their 31 games after three 
quarters, but they have lost nine of those. 
</P>
<P>
	``What it boiled down to more than anything was I did not think  
we were a loose and relaxed basketball team,'' guard Tim Legler 
said. ``The atmosphere was very tense, and lot of guys were playing 
very defensive, rather than being aggressive and offensive on the 
court. ... I think that's indicative of what's happened this year 
when we've had close games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bickerstaff sometimes left players baffled with his novel player  
rotations. Several times this season he would play a starter for 
five minutes, then bench him for the rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things like that tend to confuse you a little bit,'' said  
swingman Calbert Cheaney, whose playing time has varied greatly 
since losing his starting job early in the season. ``Hopefully, we 
can get back to a little more consistency in terms of how players 
are going to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the losses mounted, Bickerstaff admitted he wasn't able to  
get his players to produce the intangibles for a fourth-quarter 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a missing ingredient,'' Bickerstaff said after  
Sunday's game. ``And the ingredient is you have to look yourself 
and say, `Do we have the innate ability to do those things?' To me, 
it doesn't take skill, it takes an awareness of what needs to be 
done in terms of, `There's a rebound, a loose ball, I have to get 
it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	But Bickerstaff also said his team simply wasn't as talented as  
teams such as Miami, something that didn't sit well with his 
players or Unseld. 
</P>
<P>
	``The personnel we have should be in the playoffs,'' Unseld  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brovelli said the Wizards' problem was ``more of mental thing.''  
</P>
<P>
	``We just have to get to a confidence level where we know in the  
fourth quarter that we can change and hopefully finish it out,'' 
Brovelli said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bickerstaff's dismissal is the NBA's fourth coaching change this  
season, following Del Harris (Lakers), Dave Cowens (Charlotte) and 
John Calipari (New Jersey). 
</P>
<P>
	Bickerstaff was in his 10th season as an NBA coach. His record  
was 338-348, including 77-71 with the Wizards. He began his 
coaching career in Washington in 1973, serving as an assistant 
until 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Bickerstaff's best showing as a coach was in 1987, when he led  
Seattle to the Western Conference finals, one of three postseason 
appearances with the SuperSonics. 
</P>
<P>
	He was lured from his job as general manager of the Denver  
Nuggets and hired by the Wizards after the All-Star break during 
the 1996-97 season, leading Washington to its first postseason 
appearance since 1988. The Wizards were 42-40 last season.

<HEADLINE> Mueller Breaks Toe in First At-Bat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- San Francisco third baseman Bill Mueller broke  
his big left toe when he was hit by a pitch in his first at-bat of 
the season today. 
</P>
<P>
	Mueller couldn't get out of the way of Brett Tomko's breaking  
pitch in the first inning of the Giants' opener against the 
Cincinnati Reds. Tomko's fourth pitch to Mueller hit him squarely 
on the back foot, causing him to drop to the ground in pain. 
</P>
<P>
	After a couple of minutes, he got up and hobbled to first base.  
When Barry Bonds pulled the next pitch foul, Mueller took two steps 
toward second base and collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
	He was helped off the field and X-rays revealed the fracture.  
There was no immediate indication how long Mueller would be out. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlie Hayes replaced Mueller at third.  
</P>
<P>
	Mueller, 28, started 126 games at third last season, his third  
with the Giants. He hit .294 with nine homers and 59 RBIs last 
season, both career highs.

<HEADLINE> Case Raises Online Privacy Concerns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The Raytheon employees were discussing business  
issues. Manpower. Finance. Rumors of mergers and acquisitions. 
Things one might overhear at a restaurant or on the golf course. 
</P>
<P>
	But the discussions weren't private. They occurred on an  
Internet forum where anyone could read them. 
</P>
<P>
	Raytheon, claiming that its company secrets were being told to  
the world, got subpoenas forcing Yahoo! Inc., the forum operator, 
to help pierce the anonymity the workers thought they enjoyed when 
they used computer ``handles'' in place of their real names. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! complied and now two workers have reportedly resigned.  
</P>
<P>
	Privacy advocates said Monday the case is a clear illustration  
about how fragile anonymity is on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Raytheon earlier this year sued a total of 21 people for  
discussing corporate business on the forum, one of many sites on 
the Internet that offer places to talk about specific companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Some, if not all, of the defendants are Raytheon employees,  
although their identities aren't all known. 
</P>
<P>
	Topics they discussed included the company's stock price and  
gripes about the chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Chatters used aliases like ``Rayman-mass'' and  
``RaytheonVeteran'' -- names they may have thought would protect 
their true identities. 
</P>
<P>
	When Raytheon filed the suit in February, it had only those  
online handles. But armed with the subpoena, it went knocking on 
Yahoo!'s doors. 
</P>
<P>
	Diane Hunt, a Yahoo! spokeswoman wouldn't say exactly how the  
company responded to the court orders, but she did say the company 
``attempts to comply with validly issued subpoenas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunt said people who use Yahoo! services should be aware that  
while it won't sell or give away users' information, court orders 
are more serious. 
</P>
<P>
	``We notify the members in advance,'' Hunt said. ``In the  
message board terms and conditions, we make it clear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Globe reported Monday that two of the lawsuit's  
targets had left the company, apparently as a result of Raytheon's 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Raytheon spokesman David Polk would not comment on the report,  
nor would he say whether the company would terminate employees 
found to have divulged information on the forum. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to release information as it pertains to  
employees,'' Polk said. ``Each of these cases will be looked at on 
an individual basis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The situation troubles Marc Rotenberg, director of the  
Electronic Privacy Information Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``Companies should not disclose such information, even in  
response to a subpoena without some due process,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rotenberg said he would like to see Internet companies more  
aggressively fight subpoenas requesting information on users. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is personal information that is being held in trust.  
There's a real privacy issue there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	An America Online spokesman confirmed that his company had also  
received a court order commanding it to provide information on the 
Raytheon chatters. Although the substance of the order couldn't be 
immediately confirmed, AOL is the most popular provider of Internet 
accounts, so some of the chatters could have their names registered 
with AOL. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL has a policy similar to Yahoo!'s, but Rich D'Amato said  
whenever AOL receives such a subpoena in a civil case, it always 
notifies the member, giving the person 14 days to try to quash the 
subpoena. Only after that time has expired will the company turn 
over the information. 
</P>
<P>
	The Globe also reported that Microsoft had also been hit with a  
Raytheon subpoena. A message left Monday for a Microsoft spokesman 
was not immediately returned.

<HEADLINE> Probation for Northwestern Bookie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Former Northwestern quarterback Brian Ballarini  
was placed on probation for three years today for his role as a 
bookie in a sports gambling scandal that swept the campus. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hurts me, but it's dragging my parents' good name through  
the mud,'' he told the court, stopping twice to compose himself. 
</P>
<P>
	He pleaded guilty in August to transmitting gambling information  
over the telephone in the mid-1990s. Prosecutors said that once he 
was caught, Ballarini cooperated with their gambling investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	They nevertheless recommended one month behind bars plus  
probation for the 25-year-old former player, saying examples were 
needed to deter others. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Dan Webb told U.S. District Judge Ann Williams  
that other students had played more serious roles in the scandal, 
which reached into the school's football and basketball programs. 
He said Ballarini had never gambled in his life until he got to 
Northwestern. Webb blamed the school for letting a serious campus 
gambling problem fester unchecked. 
</P>
<P>
	Webb also noted that Ballarini wore a wire to help prosecutors  
crack down on Northwestern gambling and had twice appeared before a 
grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	``He made a serious mistake in judgment, but he deserves one  
more chance in life,'' Webb said, in urging Williams not to jail 
Ballarini. 
</P>
<P>
	Webb said Ballarini is ``financially very astute and would like  
to get involved in the securities industry or something like 
that.'' However, he said his client is broke and having trouble 
getting a job. He said Ballarini still owes $15,000 from his 
gambling days. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams ordered Ballarini to submit to three months of  
electronic monitoring and get mental health counseling as part of 
his probation term. 
</P>
<P>
	She also ordered him to continue with his NCAA program to  
discourage campus gambling and perform 200 hours of community 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballarini has lectured on campuses about the dangers of gambling  
and had made a videotape for the NCAA anti-gambling program.

	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Five decomposing bodies were found in a  
Kansas City home today, and police were searching for a 56-year-old 
man who lived there. 
</P>
<P>
	The man was last seen on yesterday. When asked whether the man  
was a suspect, police spokesman Floyd Mitchell said, ``We're 
concerned about his well-being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the bodies were found on the main floor and two in the  
basement of the one-story home, located near the city's Westport 
entertainment district. Police said the bodies had not been 
identified, and the cause of death had not been determined. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Jerry Gallagher said the air conditioning was running when  
police first arrived at the home, making it harder to determine how 
long the bodies had been decomposing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was turned up and cold so the bodies wouldn't rot as  
quick,'' Gallagher said. 
</P>
<P>
	A neighbor, Stephanie Wymore, 41, said she heard what sounded  
like gun shots Friday morning and that there had been no activity 
in the house since then. She said she heard the air conditioner 
turn on just after the shots and run continuously since then. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody's come in, nobody's gone out,'' she said. ``There's  
been nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A neighbor, Judy Vigler, 59, said the home had been occupied for  
about 14 years by two men, a father and stepson, both limousine 
drivers.

<HEADLINE> Va. Workers Strike Newport News </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (AP) -- Work continued today at Newport News  
Shipbuilding despite the first strike in 20 years against the only 
shipyard that builds and refuels the Navy's nuclear-powered 
aircraft carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Local 8888 of the United Steelworkers struck in a  
dispute over wages and benefits when their contract expired at 
midnight Sunday. The union represents 9,200 hourly workers out of 
the yard's total 17,400 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're being very productive. It's quiet and orderly,''  
shipyard spokeswoman Jerri Fuller Dickseski said Monday. She said a 
number of employees reported for work, although she declined to be 
specific. 
</P>
<P>
	Local president Arnold Outlaw said he did not know exactly how  
many workers were on strike but ``I don't think there's very many 
(union) members in the shipyard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Union members picketed outside the shipyard's gates, shouting  
``Scab!'' as cars carrying nonstriking workers drove past at 
midafternoon. About a dozen police officers stood nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	No negotiating sessions had been held since union members voted  
Thursday to reject what the shipyard called its final offer, and 
Ms. Dickseski said none were scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	The union demanded an across-the-board hourly pay increase of  
$3.95 over three years. The current top rate for a mechanic is 
$14.53. 
</P>
<P>
	The shipyard offered wage increases over three years that it  
said would boost the average worker's pay $2.49 an hour, with 
automatic promotions based on experience and skills. 
</P>
<P>
	The last strike at the yard, in 1979, lasted three months.  
</P>
<P>
	The shipyard builds the Navy's Nimitz-class nuclear-powered  
aircraft carriers and repairs and refuels them. Ms. Dickseski said 
the strike had no effect on the shipyard's contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	The yard currently is building the aircraft carrier Ronald  
Reagan, refueling the carrier USS Nimitz and doing some maintenance 
work on the carrier USS Harry S. Truman. The yard also is working 
on the USS Norwall, a submarine scheduled to be deactivated. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Newport News fell 75 cents to $30.25 in trading on the  
New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Indians Already Sell Out Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Cleveland Indians go into the 1999 season  
with a hefty payroll but also financially secure with a bankroll 
from a sold out home schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Since moving to Jacobs Field in 1994, the Indians have never had  
a losing record, and they've been to the World Series twice. The 
Indians have sold out their last 292 home games. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland opens its season Tuesday night at Anaheim. The home  
opener is scheduled for Monday against Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians announced last week that all Jacobs Field tickets  
for the 1999 season, about 3.5 million, have been sold at an 
average ticket price of $19.37. That assures a guaranteed revenue 
source of about $67 million. Ticket sales last year provided about 
38 percent of total revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland will open the season with a payroll of about $69  
million, among the top six in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``We try to budget so as to ensure a profit for just the regular  
season,'' Ron McQuate, Indians director of corporate planning and 
development, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Real estate developer Richard E. Jacobs maintains control of the  
team, largely through his privately held shares in an unusual 
public-private partnership. Cleveland Indians Baseball Co., the 
public portion of the team, sold 4 million shares in its initial 
offering last June. The stock was sold initially at $15 a share, 
but has been selling recently on the NASDAQ market at about $8.50. 
</P>
<P>
	From June, when the public structure of the team took effect,  
through the end of last year, the team produced a profit of nearly 
$7.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But last year leading up to June, the Indians operated at a loss  
of $9.7 million, according to disclosure document filed last week 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Combining the two periods, the 1998 net loss of about $2.5  
million contrasts with a $22.6 million profit in 1997. But it 
wasn't really a loss, McQuate says. 
</P>
<P>
	About $11.5 million subtracted from the public side of the  
ledger was actually the profit paid to Jacobs' private portion of 
the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	McQuate said several unusual factors explain why last year was  
not as profitable as 1997. The Indians in 1997 accounted for 
receiving $9.2 million in expansion fees from the Arizona 
Diamondbacks and Tampa Bay Devil Rays. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians were involved in 18 postseason games in 1997, when  
they advanced to the seventh game of the World Series. They were in 
10 postseason games in 1998. As a result, revenue from postseason 
games was about $4.3 million less last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The team also saw a $2 million drop in merchandise sales,  
largely the result of the lack of a World Series appearance, 
McQuate said.

<HEADLINE> Libyan Pair Will Go on Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Two years ago, Lamen Khalifa Fhimah squarely  
faced a television camera, pulled out the Muslim holy book, the 
Koran, and swore his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
	Fhimah, 42, will almost certainly renew that pious oath when he  
and co-accused Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi, 46, go on trial before 
a Scottish court in the Netherlands on charges of blowing up the 
Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	``I declare I was not part of the issue,'' Fhimah said in  
December 1996 during a rare public appearance he and al-Megrahi 
made on an Arabic television talk show. 
</P>
<P>
	Fhimah went on to say that his mother had died from the stress  
caused by the charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
	Al-Megrahi, a father of four, was equally emphatic in his  
denials. He told television viewers that when he learned of the 
charges against him, he hid it from his wife because she was ill at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We, my children and my family, are still suffering because of  
this,'' said al-Megrahi. 
</P>
<P>
	On Dec. 21, 1988, at Malta's Luqa airport, the two men allegedly  
planted a Samsonite hardback suitcase containing a bomb aboard an 
Air Malta flight to Frankfurt. The suitcase was routed as 
unaccompanied baggage from Frankfurt to London and onto the New 
York-bound Flight 103. 
</P>
<P>
	Nestled in the forward hold of the jetliner, it exploded over  
Scotland. A Scottish warrant says the bombing was the culmination 
of three years of plotting by al-Megrahi and Fhimah. All 259 
passengers and 11 people on the ground in Lockerbie were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. indictment says the two men built the bomb with plastic  
explosives supplied by the Libyan secret service, the Jamahirya 
Security Organization, which the United States accuses of 
international terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department says al-Megrahi is well-connected to the  
Libyan regime of Moammar Gadhafi and says he was head of security 
at Libyan Arab Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Fhimah was manager of the Libya Arab Airlines office in Malta,  
and reportedly had access to Air Malta luggage tags. 
</P>
<P>
	In Malta, the explosives were allegedly kept at the Libyan  
airline office, a Libyan cultural center, and at Fhimah's home. 
</P>
<P>
	On Dec. 7, 1988, al-Megrahi traveled from Libya to Malta, where  
he purchased clothing the bomb was wrapped in, according to the 
indictment and the Scottish warrant. 
</P>
<P>
	Al-Megrahi returned to Libya but again went to Malta on or about  
Dec. 20, the indictment says. It says he returned to Libya on Dec. 
21 and hadn't left the country until being handed over for trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The special trial in the Netherlands by Scottish judges was part  
of a deal negotiated with Gadhafi in return for turning the men 
over. 
</P>
<P>
	Fhimah has acknowledged he worked for the Libyan Arab Airlines  
in Malta but says he left his job three months before the bombing 
and returned to Libya. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am neither an intelligence man nor a politician. I am simply  
a decent employee. Consequently, I want to defend myself and my 
reputation,'' he had said in a Radio Monte Carlo interview in 1991. 
``This is against my principles and the values with which I was 
raised and which do not permit me to kill an innocent soul.''

<HEADLINE> Report Cites China-Clinton Donation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A prominent Democratic fund-raiser claims  
there was a direct link between the head of China's military 
intelligence and illicit financial contributions that allegedly 
went to President Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign, the Los 
Angeles Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Ji Shengde, the head of Chinese military intelligence, sent  
$300,000 in campaign donations to Johnny Chung, a Democratic 
fund-raiser in Southern California, The Times reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a portion of the money reached Democratic coffers, the  
newspaper said, citing sources familiar with Chung's sealed 
statements to federal prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	It is illegal for U.S. political parties or candidates to accept  
contributions from foreign sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung, a Taiwanese-born businessman who is now a U.S. citizen,  
donated nearly $400,000 to Democratic candidates and causes from 
1994 to 1996, but the money was returned after questions arose 
about its legality. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung admitted making nearly $30,000 in illegal contributions to  
Democrats including $20,000 to the Clinton-Gore re-election 
campaign. In December, he was sentenced to five years probation and 
3,000 hours of community service as part of a plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung and Ji were brought together by Liu Chaoying, who was a  
Chung business partner as well as a lieutenant colonel in the 
People's Liberation Army, The Times said. Liu did not respond 
Friday to questions sent by The Times to her office in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	In their first meeting in August 1996, Chung said, he declined  
Ji's money but the general said he was already engaged in similar 
transactions with others serving as conduits for Chinese funds to 
support Clinton's re-election. 
</P>
<P>
	Within a few days, Liu deposited $300,000 into Chung's Hong Kong  
bank account, telling him it was from Ji, sources told the 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal election records show that five weeks after receiving  
the money, Chung donated $35,000 in three checks to the Democratic 
National Committee. The remaining funds went to one of Chung's 
California bank accounts but it is not known how that money was 
used. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic party ``was unaware of any supposed  
relationship'' between Chung and the Chinese government at the time 
of the contributions, said DNC spokesman Rick Hess. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung declined to speak with the newspaper, saying he has  
``already told the whole truth to the grand jury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for China's embassy in Washington, D.C., denied any  
involvement in the 1996 elections. ``All these allegations about 
so-called Chinese government officials' political contributions 
into U.S. campaigns are sheer fabrications,'' said Yu Shuning.

<HEADLINE> Judge OKs Radiation Suit Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- A federal judge on Monday approved a tentative  
$5 million settlement of a lawsuit charging that cancer patients 
were unknowingly subjected to military-sponsored radiation 
experiments in the 1960s and '70s. 
</P>
<P>
	The families that filed the class-action lawsuit claimed  
high-dose radiation hastened the deaths and increased the suffering 
of patients, in effect making them casualties of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed five years ago, alleged that terminally ill  
cancer patients treated at Cincinnati General Hospital between 1960 
and 1971 were given full-body and partial-body doses of radiation 
so researchers could measure its effects. The facility is now known 
as University Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Defendants, including doctors, the federal government and the  
hospital, argued that they attempted to ease suffering and that 
patients died because they already were terminally ill with various 
forms of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one of the patients survives; she was 10 when she received  
radiation treatment for bone cancer in 1969. Many of the 90 
patients died soon after receiving radiation. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Sandra Beckwith said she would hold a  
hearing May 4 to make the settlement final, barring any problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the families would get about $50,000 each, said Robert  
Newman, attorney for about 50 plaintiffs. ``I think everybody 
around the table is pleased and happy it is over,'' he said. A 
probate court would determine how to distribute the money. 
Attorneys have asked for $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers acknowledged that the Defense Department paid  
$651,000 for the test results so it could learn about the effects 
of radiation exposure. They maintained that they thought radiation 
-- still used in treating some cancers -- would be beneficial. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed settlement also would require a memorial plaque at  
the University of Cincinnati campus and an apology from the federal 
government.

<HEADLINE> Tornado Kills Six in Louisiana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BENTON, La. (AP) -- Carrying an armful of hats from the wreckage  
of her house trailer, Hattie Turner glanced nervously over her 
shoulder at dark clouds forming on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to ever see a storm again,'' she said Sunday, a  
day after her home was destroyed by a deadly tornado that ripped 
through northwest Louisiana. ``I don't want to hear the wind or see 
it rain. It's too scary now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turner was one of hundreds of people who lost their homes  
Saturday as the tornado passed through, ripping up trees and 
tossing trailers in this northwest Louisiana community. 
</P>
<P>
	Six people died, and at least nine others remained hospitalized  
Sunday in critical or guarded condition, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, ``we have at least another 100 of what I call  
walking wounded. People that were hurt but didn't need to be 
hospitalized,'' said Bossier Parish Sheriff Larry Deen. 
</P>
<P>
	The tornado, believed to be about a half-mile wide, curved  
through farm and rural land, hitting two mobile home parks as well 
as the upscale subdivision of Palmetto Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Marilyn Duckwater said the tornado -- packing winds of 207 to 260  
mph -- roared in with an unbelievable force, reducing her 
three-bedroom brick house to a pile of soggy rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	``My ears popped, you couldn't even hear the walls or trees  
falling because of the roar of the wind. I can't believe anyone 
survived it,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents scrambled to pick up what they could before darkness  
fell because utility companies still hadn't hooked up the water, 
gas and electricity that was cut off a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``You pick up what you can, see what's left and go on,'' Ken  
Anderson said after surveying the damage to his subdivision. ``It's 
mostly small stuff. Anything big is gone or ruined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lisa Moore's family members stacked a few pieces of furniture  
that once adorned her trailer house. Her mother had already 
salvaged more precious goods, clutching two mud-spattered snapshots 
and a rosary that had belonged to her 25-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore, who was five months pregnant, died when the trailer  
flipped upside down. The twister ripped away the walls, scattering 
the contents across roads and into shrubs and tree branches. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were going to find out if she was going to have a girl or  
boy on Monday,'' said Linda Turner, Moore's step-grandmother. ``Now 
we're just looking for little pieces here and there so we can have 
something left to hold onto.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Christina Harrison, 14, died not far from Moore's house.  
Neighbors said she was sitting on a couch when the storm demolished 
the trailer she lived in. 
</P>
<P>
	The others killed were identified as Betty Dyal, 60, of Benton;  
Kenneth Hewitt, 53, of Bossier City; John L. Taylor, 65, of Waldo, 
Ark.; and Michael Andrews, 41, of Shreveport. 
</P>
<P>
	About 6 p.m. another tornado uprooted trees in rural Taylortown,  
about 20 miles southeast of Benton, emergency officials said. There 
were no reports of injuries or damage. Tornado watches remained in 
effect into the evening for most of north Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	To make matters worse, torrential rain storms hit the area  
Sunday night, flooding streets and submerging cars in Shreveport 
and Bossier City. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials closed Interstate 20 at Dixie Inn, about 20 miles west  
of Shreveport, because the highway was under water. There were no 
immediate reports of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Mazziotti, director of the Bossier Parish Office of  
Emergency Preparedness, said the threat of destruction wasn't over. 
Officials were worried about another band of strong storms expected 
to reach northwest Louisiana by this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``You see this on television and you think, `Wow, those poor  
people,''' said Tom Miles as he looked at the toppled walls of his 
house. ``Then you turn off the TV and forget it. We're the ones in 
those sad pictures now.''

<HEADLINE> Interest Rates Mixed in T-Bill Sale / T-Bills  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on short-term Treasury  
securities were mixed in Monday's auction as yields on three-month 
bills dipped to the lowest level since October. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department sold $6.5 billion in three-month bills  
at a discount rate of 4.265 percent, down from 4.380 percent last 
week. An additional $7.5 billion was sold in six-month bills at a 
rate of 4.345 percent, up slightly from 4.340 percent last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-month rate was the lowest since Oct. 26, when the  
bills sold for 4.070 percent. The six-month rate was the highest 
since March 22, when the rate was 4.420. 
</P>
<P>
	The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors  
-- 4.383 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling 
for $9,892.20 and 4.517 percent for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,780.30. 
</P>

	NATO Hits Targets in Yugoslavia  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO struck fuel depots, bridges and  
army barracks throughout Yugoslavia today, and said it was taking 
particular aim at Serbian ground forces accused of terrorizing 
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. President Clinton promised an 
``undiminished, unceasing and unrelenting'' air campaign, saying it 
would no longer be enough for Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic 
to just stop the killing. Milosevic defiantly promised to rebuild 
the bomb-damaged structures, denouncing NATO ``aggressors'' and 
``criminals.'' Serb media have been reporting some civilian 
casualties in the NATO raids.

	U.S. Seeks Donations for Kosovo Aid  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Appealing directly to Americans to help the  
victims of Slobodan Milosevic's ``expulsion policy,'' President 
Clinton announced a toll-free 1-800 telephone number that people 
can call to donate money for ethnic Albanians expelled from Kosovo. 
The number -- 1-800-USAID-RELIEF -- was up and running this 
afternoon. He said the United States has put $150 million so far 
into humanitarian relief. The first shipments of 500,000 specially 
prepared meals for Kosovar refugees were en route to Italy, to be 
funneled into Albania. Another 600,000 meals were going to 
Macedonia, and tents, sleeping bags and blankets were being shipped 
to both countries from Travis Air Force Base in California and U.S. 
bases in Germany.

	Libya Delivers Pan Am Bomb Suspects

<P>
	CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands (AP) -- The United Nations suspended  
sanctions against Libya after Moammar Gadhafi surrendered two 
suspected Libyan intelligence agents for trial in the deadly 1988 
bombing of a Pan Am jet. The handover ended seven years of 
punishing sanctions against Libya and began what could be a lengthy 
trial process in the Netherlands. The two Libyans were being held 
tonight, awaiting arraignment under Scottish law on charges of 
planting the suitcase bomb that blew up Flight 103 over Lockerbie, 
Scotland, killing 270 people.

Henderson, 21, pleaded guilty to felony murder and kidnapping, 
avoiding the possibility of the death penalty. Authorities said 
Henderson and Aaron McKinney, 21, posed as homosexuals and lured 
Shepard out of a bar last October, kidnapped and pistol-whipped him

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- On the eve of Premier Zhu Rongji's visit, U.S.  
and Chinese trade officials intensified efforts to strike a deal 
granting China its long-sought membership in the World Trade 
Organization. But the Clinton administration insisted any agreement 
would have to meet demands by U.S. manufacturers and farmers for 
access to China's huge market as a way of shrinking America's 
record $57 billion trade deficit with China. Some of the biggest 
sticking points include Chinese barriers to exports of American 
farm products, chemicals and operations by U.S. insurance 
companies.

in mice, at least, the drug endostatin may also greatly slow the 
development of atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries. 
Endostatin has not been tested yet on people.

	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Charlie Hayes hit a three-run homer in the  
eighth inning that provided the final turning point in today's wild 
San Francisco-Cincinnati opener that ended with an 11-8 Giants 
victory. The Reds overcame a four-run deficit with homers by Mike 
Cameron, Mark Sweeney and Sean Casey, pulling ahead 8-6 with a 
six-run sixth inning. But the Giants quieted the crowd of 55,112 
with a pair of homers -- by Ellis Burks and Hayes -- that pulled it 
out.

<HEADLINE> E. Coli Blamed in Minn. Beef Recall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An E. coli outbreak that sickened at least 6  
people visiting a Maine ski resort has been traced to contaminated 
ground beef produced at a Minnesota meat processing plant, 
authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have genetic fingerprints that link E. coli 0157:H7 in  
samples of the meat from Rochester Meats to the patients in Maine 
who have become ill,'' said Beth Gaston, spokesman for the 
Agriculture Department's food safety and inspection office. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking into whether or not other states may be involved  
as well,'' said Tom Skinner, a spokesman for the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	Rochester Meats Inc., of Rochester, Minn., last week recalled  
170,780 pounds of product -- the equivalent of one day's production. 
The company supplies meat for restaurants and institutions across 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials said Monday they were unaware of any link  
between their product and illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``USDA has not confirmed that with us,'' said Rochester Meats  
spokeswoman Joanne Randen. 
</P>
<P>
	The recalled products include frozen ground beef patties, ground  
chuck patties, chopped beefsteak, beef patties, meat for chili, 
beef patty mix and pure beef bulk. 
</P>
<P>
	The meat was produced Dec. 1 and sold in 10-, 15- and 20-pound  
packages. They are marked with the Julian code 8335 and 
Establishment 8999 in the inspection mark. 
</P>
<P>
	Maine officials had a tally of seven E. coli illnesses but USDA  
did not have confirmation that the seventh was a genetic match to 
the Rochester Meats outbreak, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The people became ill while visiting the Sunday River Ski Resort  
in Bethel, Maine, said Dr. Kathleen Gensheimer, state 
epidemiologist for the Maine Department of Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
	The first illness was reported Feb. 11, and three people had to  
be hospitalized, Gensheimer said. The entire group, which included 
four children, has since recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	It is possible that other people became ill but treated  
themselves instead of seeking medical attention, Geinsheimer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You always have to assume that in any scenario. . . one is  
probably only receiving information on those who are seriously ill 
versus those who are mildly ill,'' Gensheimer said. 
</P>
<P>
	There are an estimated 10,000 to 20,000 cases of E. coli 0157:H7  
infection in the United States each year. 
</P>
<P>
	When ingested by humans, the E. coli bacterium can cause serious  
illness and sometimes death, especially in children and the 
elderly. Symptoms include chills and bloody diarrhea. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident is the second meat outbreak in the country in  
recent months. Bil Mar Foods in Zeeland, Mich. recalled 15 million 
pounds of hot dogs and deli meats in December because of possible 
contamination with listeria. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen deaths and six miscarriages and stillbirths have been  
linked to the Bil Mar recall.

<HEADLINE> `Cybersquatters' Face Crackdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The company that assigns Internet addresses is  
reportedly cracking down on ``cybersquatters'' -- people who 
register catchy domain names they hope to resell at a profit. 
</P>
<P>
	Network Solutions Inc., which has an exclusive government  
contract to register Internet addresses, recently purged 18,000 
registrations that it suspected were held by speculators, who 
typically register thousands of names at once, The New York Times 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The company told the newspaper it had the legal right to reclaim  
most names because the registrants had not paid on time. Network 
Solutions charges $70 for a two-year registration of a domain name. 
</P>
<P>
	``These were well-known speculators that had registered  
thousands of domain names,'' Christopher Clough, a spokesman for 
Network Solutions in Herndon, Va., told the newspaper. He said the 
company regularly purged delinquent registrations and specifically 
aimed at domain-name speculators. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate attempt to curb domain-name speculation last  
month, the company enacted a policy of restricting access to ``root 
zone'' files, which can alert speculators about when a domain name 
will become available. 
</P>
<P>
	Network Solutions said it would no longer make the files freely  
available, but instead would license them for specific purposes, 
the Times said. As a result, many businesses that help secure 
domain-name addresses found themselves unable to do business. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Woodward, president of Myinternet.com, a registration  
services company, was one of them, the newspaper said. Last month, 
he discovered that his company suddenly was unable to get access to 
the root zone files. After he threatened to file a lawsuit, his 
access was restored, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> High Court Decides for Prosecutors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prosecutors cannot be sued for having lawyers  
searched and interfering with their ability to advise a client 
appearing before a grand jury, the Supreme Court said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The court ruled unanimously that such action by California  
prosecutors in the Menendez brothers' murder case did not violate a 
lawyer's constitutional right to practice his profession. 
</P>
<P>
	The search of the lawyer was only a ``brief interruption,''  
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote for the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hold that the Fourteenth Amendment right to practice one's  
calling is not violated by the execution of a search warrant, 
whether calculated to annoy or even to prevent consultation with a 
grand jury witness,'' Rehnquist wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal appeals court had ruled that lawyer Paul L. Gabbert  
could sue two Los Angeles County prosecutors who handled the second 
murder trial of Lyle and Erik Menendez in the killings of their 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Gabbert represented Traci Baker, a defense witness in the  
brothers' first trial, in which two juries were unable to reach a 
verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors David Conn and Carol Najera believed that Baker, a  
former girlfriend of Lyle Menendez, had received a letter from him 
instructing her to testify falsely. Baker was served with a 
subpoena in March 1994 requiring her to testify before a grand jury 
and produce any letters from Lyle Menendez. 
</P>
<P>
	When Baker and Gabbert arrived at the courthouse, Conn got a  
warrant to search Gabbert. Because the lawyer was being searched 
while Baker was called to testify, he was not available to confer 
with her when she asked to speak to her lawyer outside the grand 
jury room. 
</P>
<P>
	Gabbert sued Conn and Najera, saying they violated his  
constitutional right to practice his profession. A federal judge 
ruled for the prosecutors based on qualified immunity. Qualified 
immunity protects government officials from civil rights lawsuits 
so long as they did not violate someone's clearly established 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated Gabbert's  
lawsuit, saying the prosecutors were not protected by qualified 
immunity. The prosecutors' actions were not reasonable because they 
were intended to keep Gabbert from consulting with Baker during her 
grand jury appearance, the appeals court said. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors' appeal to the Supreme Court said they should  
not have to face lawsuits over an incident that did not harm the 
lawyer's overall ability to do his job. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the Supreme Court ruled for the prosecutors.  
</P>
<P>
	Rehnquist noted that grand jury witnesses have no constitutional  
right to have a lawyer present in the grand jury room, and added 
that the court need not decide whether there is a right to have a 
lawyer present outside the grand jury room for consultation. 
Gabbert is not entitled to raise that issue on his own, the chief 
justice said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Conn vs. Gabbert, 97-1802.

<HEADLINE> Knight Ridder Bureau Chief Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gary Blonston, chief of the Knight Ridder  
Washington news bureau and a veteran journalist, died Sunday at his 
home of cancer. He was 56. 
</P>
<P>
	During a career that spanned nearly 36 years, Blonston served as  
a reporter, editor and writing coach. He worked at The Miami 
Herald, the Detroit Free Press and the San Jose Mercury News before 
coming to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan Wolman, former Washington bureau chief of The  
Associated Press and now the AP's managing editor, said of 
Blonston: ``He ran one of the best bureaus in town, constantly 
juggling between hard news coverage and the sort of perspective 
pieces that newspapers need from Washington. He had a refined sense 
of irony, just what you need to make sense of it all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blonston was a principal writer on two Pulitzer Prize-winning  
projects. One was during his time at the Free Press, where he came 
under gunfire while covering Detroit's 1967 riots. Blonston also 
worked on the Mercury News' reporting of the 1989 Loma Prieta 
earthquake in the San Francisco Bay area. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1968, Blonston found himself in the middle of rioting  
protesters and police officers outside the Democratic National 
Convention. Coughing from tear gas, he dictated his story to an 
editor on deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Blonston also freelanced for newspapers and magazines, on topics  
ranging from politics to prehistoric art. During a 1967 strike at 
the Free Press -- when Blonston was working at Chrysler Corp. -- he 
wrote a book on the history of the Plymouth. In 1996, he published 
``William Morris,'' a book about a famed glass blower. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in 1942 in Cleveland, Blonston spent much of his childhood  
in central Florida. He earned bachelor's and master's degrees in 
journalism from Northwestern University. He began his newspaper 
career with The Miami Herald in 1964, moving to the Free Press two 
years later. 
</P>
<P>
	He moved to San Jose in 1987, then to Knight Ridder's Washington  
bureau. He became bureau chief in August 1995, supervising a staff 
of 60 reporters and editors. 
</P>
<P>
	Blonston is survived by his wife, Susan Goldberg, a deputy  
managing editor at USA Today, two children from a previous marriage 
and a sister.

<HEADLINE> Shrinks Provide Service at Hotels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- You're in your room at a tony Nob Hill  
hotel, alone on a business trip. Maybe that big deal you flew 3,000 
miles for didn't go off just right. Feeling vulnerable? Confused? 
Depressed? Help can come as quickly as room service. 
</P>
<P>
	Meet Charmian Anderson, a soft-spoken psychologist who, for $2 a  
minute, will do her best to ease your worries and soothe your ego. 
</P>
<P>
	On-call hotel therapists are a dream come true for travelers who  
have never sought out counseling or Woody Allen types skittish 
about leaving behind the securities of home, Ms. Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody knows, it's private. They can talk as long as they  
want,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, only two guests have taken the plunge. But Ms. Anderson  
is convinced her line of work will soon be as common as on-call 
hotel doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can just see that with the pace we live and the technology,  
it begs for this rapid response to serve people. All businesses are 
trying to respond with quality. Whether it's me or someone else, 
it's going to occur.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One client was a traveling investment banker who panicked when  
he learned he had only weeks to raise millions of dollars to save a 
failing company. Another hotel guest was forced to decide on the 
spot whether to take a job that would mean moving back in with her 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pressure was happening, it was there and they needed to  
deal with it right now,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Anderson has hung her shingle at the 20-room Nob Hill  
Lambourne, which tailors itself to the ``healthy executive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are no bedtime chocolates here, but guests can loosen up  
with one of 14 on-call massage therapists, or help themselves to 
vitamin packs left on their pillows. Breakfast includes blue-green 
algae shakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously there's a need'' for an on-call therapist to round  
out the psychological component, said Charlie Robles, the hotel's 
general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``So many people are traveling now. They're away from home or  
telecommuting. They don't have their mentor with them or even a 
boss to say, 'how do you handle this,' and that's what they're 
using her for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chekitan Dev, a marketing professor at Cornell's School of Hotel  
Administration, said on-call hotel therapy is ``an idea whose time 
has come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The business traveler, which is the major lifeblood of hotels  
in major cities, is probably more stressed out than any time in the 
past,'' Dev said. ``Their question is, 'What can you do for me that 
can make me feel better than when I arrived?' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Hotel founder Chip Conley got the idea to sign Ms. Anderson on  
after a guest requested a coach to help prepare for an interview 
and there was no one working there to do it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still in need of therapy. I thought the rest of the world  
was too,'' Conley laughed. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea hasn't exactly taken off in the year since Ms.  
Anderson, who has a busy psychotherapy practice of her own, agreed 
to consult with the guests by phone or in their hotel rooms. The 
hotel changed her title from ``corporate psychologist'' to 
``corporate coach'' to minimize the stigma. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Ms. Anderson sees a need.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know the messes involved in traveling. I know what it's like  
to be in business and have pressures,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Zimmer Fights Injury To Coach Yanks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- The memory of a weekend tiff with owner  
George Steinbrenner already has started to fade. But nothing has 
been able to erase the debilitating pain New York Yankees interim 
manager Don Zimmer feels every day. 
</P>
<P>
	After more than five decades in baseball, Zimmer should be at  
home recovering from arthroscopic surgery on his right knee. 
Instead, he's managing the defending champions as they open their 
season at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer is doing it only because of his friendship with Joe  
Torre, who turned the team over to his bench coach while recovering 
from prostate cancer surgery. Torre is not expected back until May 
or June. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it wasn't for Joe, I wouldn't have done it. I would've  
said, `Leave me as bench coach,''' Zimmer said. ``First of all, I 
wasn't capable of getting out of bed at the time. And I'm crippled 
over it now. I did it for Joe. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Joe went down, Joe wanted me to take the club,'' Zimmer  
added. ``So I'll do the best I can, and the players will do the 
best they can, until Joe gets back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pain in his leg is so bad Zimmer moves only with great  
effort. He uses a bat as a cane, yet still has trouble standing for 
long at the batting cage. Throughout spring training, he let coach 
Chris Chambliss bring the lineup card to home plate. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer spent Monday afternoon at the team hotel ``with one leg  
up on two pillows -- that's really the only relief I get.'' Then he 
headed to the ballpark, knowing he'd be unable to go to the mound 
to remove a pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he'll leave that task to pitching coach Mel  
Stottlemyre. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm embarrassed of hobbling out in the middle of the baseball  
diamond,'' Zimmer said. ``And going out and arguing with an umpire, 
it's going to be rough. If something happens at second base, it may 
take me so long to get there I'll forget what it was about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer's stint as interim manager got a lot messier this past  
weekend when he got caught in the middle of Steinbrenner's battle 
with pitcher Hideki Irabu. It ended with the interim manager 
challenging the permanent owner to fire him. 
</P>
<P>
	The situation began last Thursday when Steinbrenner, infuriated  
that Irabu had failed to cover first base during a spring training 
game, called the pitcher a ``fat ... toad'' and decided to leave 
him behind when the team broke training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	But after Zimmer penciled in Ramiro Mendoza instead of Irabu for  
the start Wednesday at Oakland in the Yankees' third game of the 
season, Steinbrenner announced he was hoping Irabu would start that 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer shot back that he was the manager, and would not be told  
by anyone how to run the club on the field. When Irabu rejoined the 
club Sunday and apologized to the manager and teammates, Zimmer 
reiterated Mendoza would start Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Steinbrenner told The New York Times that he would  
abide by Zimmer's decision on Wednesday's starter. 
</P>
<P>
	``(It) is the call of the manager. Period. Exclamation. I've  
given him the players and it's his job from that point on, whether 
it's Torre or Zimmer,'' Steinbrenner said. 
</P>
<P>
	The owner then summed up the weekend misunderstanding with  
Zimmer by adding, ``I think in the heat of the moment, Zim just 
lost control. I chalk it up as zero.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With that crisis apparently calmed, Zimmer now can focus on the  
difficult task of playing caretaker to a team that -- even with 
five-time Cy Young Award winner Roger Clemens added to the roster -- 
will be hard pressed to match its record 125 wins of last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hardest thing to do in sports is to win when everyone  
expects you to,'' Zimmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Probably nobody ever will improve on 125 wins and 50 losses.  
You'll probably never see it again. You read in the paper and you 
listen to somebody on a sports show and they say, `Well, the 
Yankees are a cinch.' But there's no such thing. We're all going in 
even on Monday. Hopefully, we can win an Eastern Division 
championship, but it won't be easy.''

<HEADLINE> Wynette's Daughters File $50M Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Three of Tammy Wynette's daughters  
Monday filed a $50 million lawsuit blaming the country star's death 
on negligence by her husband and her doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	Daughters Tina Jones, Jackie Daly and Georgette Smith said Ms.  
Wynette died because Dr. Wallis Marsh of Pittsburgh did not monitor 
her condition closely and overprescribed medication. 
</P>
<P>
	They also said Ms. Wynette's fifth husband, George Richey, did  
not seek medical care for her after being urged to do so by Marsh 
on the day of her death. 
</P>
<P>
	Marsh ``inappropriately treated her in a number of different  
ways,'' said Ed Yarbrough, an attorney for the daughters. ``It 
became clear that her husband was very much a party to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Nashville's medical examiner said he would reconsider  
the daughters' request to have Ms. Wynette's body exhumed and an 
autopsy performed. Bruce Levy, who in February denied their request 
and said he was satisfied with Marsh's finding, said he was 
reviewing new information provided by the daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Stand by Your Man'' singer died on April 6, 1998, at her  
Nashville home at age 55. Her body was found by Richey, and Marsh 
flew from Pittsburgh to sign the death certificate. He listed the 
cause of death as a blood clot in the lungs. 
</P>
<P>
	Telephone messages for Richey and his lawyer were not  
immediately returned. A call to Marsh's lawyers also was not 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Richey is not the father of any of the daughters. Ms. Wynette's  
fourth daughter, Gwen Nicholas, is not a party to the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Wynette had 20 No. 1 hits, including ``Stand by Your Man''  
and ``D-I-V-O-R-C-E.''

<HEADLINE> O's Opener Honors Cal Ripken Sr. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The Baltimore Orioles remembered Cal Ripken Sr.  
on opening day. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Monday's game against Tampa Bay, the Orioles unveiled a  
large, orange ``7'' (Ripken's number) in the third-base coaching 
box, where Ripken did most of his work in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the Orioles will wear a two-inch patch of the No. 7  
on the right sleeves of their jerseys this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, who died March 24 of lung cancer at age 63, served 36  
years with the Orioles as a player, scout, coach and manager. He 
also helped shape the career of one of the best players in 
franchise history, Cal Ripken Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	The team honored Ripken Sr., as well as several other members of  
the organization who died during the offseason, with a moment of 
silence before the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Former shortstop Mark Belanger, minor league outfielder Joel  
Stephens and video coach Jeff Nelson were also remembered. A video 
montage of Ripken was displayed on the center-field scoreboard as 
the sellout crowd stood silently.

<HEADLINE> 3 Killed in Medical Chopper Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIAN SPRINGS, Nev. (AP) -- A pilot and two nurses aboard a  
medical helicopter died when their aircraft crashed in snowy 
weather shortly after delivering a patient to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The helicopter had dropped off a patient at Valley Hospital  
Medical Center in Las Vegas but the crew failed to make a routine 
15-minute check-in about 11:30 p.m. Saturday, said hospital 
spokeswoman Rebecca Blair. 
</P>
<P>
	The crew of the air ambulance, a Euro BO-105, was returning to  
base in Pahrump when it was reported down about 12:10 a.m. Sunday, 
said Jerry Acosta, a duty officer with the Federal Aviation 
Administration in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash site was about 35 miles northwest of Las Vegas. ``It's  
a pretty devastating scene,'' said Lt. Richard Alba, spokesman for 
the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash killed pilot James Bond Jr., and flight nurses Kathy  
Batterman and Leroy Shelton, said Ms. Blair, whose medical center 
operates the Flight for Life air ambulance program. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Transportation Safety Board was investigating.  
</P>
<P>
	Bond was born in Bulgaria and trained overseas as a fighter  
pilot and helicopter pilot. He came to the United States in 1986 
and joined Flight for Life last June, the hospital said. 
</P>
<P>
	Batterman began her career at Valley Hospital in June 1981 and  
was one of the original Flight for Life crew members. Shelton 
joined the hospital in 1996, working in the cardiovascular 
laboratory, and only recently joined Flight for Life, according to 
the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The twin-engine Flight for Life helicopters transport ill and  
injured patients and operates in portions of Nevada, Utah, Arizona 
and California. More than 15,000 flights have been made since the 
program began in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flight for Life team includes nine pilots and 12 nurses.  
</P>
<P>
	The last fatal crash involving a Flight for Life helicopter  
occurred in 1983, when three crew members were killed, Ms. Blair 
said.

<HEADLINE>  Tokyo Stock Prices Close Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's main stock index closed higher today after  
the central bank announced a rise in corporate sentiment, but sharp 
early gains were wiped out by profit-taking. The dollar gained 
against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average climbed 44.59  
points, or 0.27 percent, to finish the day at 16,334.78 points. On 
Friday, the average closed down 37.37 points, or 0.23 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.36 yen in late afternoon trading, up 0.70  
yen from late Friday in Tokyo and also above its late New York 
level of 120.55 yen on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In its closely-watched quarterly ``tankan'' survey, the Bank of  
Japan reported business sentiment at large manufacturers improved 
moderately from the previous tankan, prompting hope that the 
economy has bottomed out. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei average was up more than 300 points at one point in  
morning trading after the release of the survey, but share prices 
fell back in the afternoon as traders pocketed profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the moderate upswing in corporate confidence cheered the  
market, and investors are eager to buy on any significant dips, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The data confirms the economy has begun to bottom and that its  
outlook is expected to improve,'' said Masatoshi Sato, manager of 
the investment information group at Kankaku Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The tankan survey measures the percentage of firms seeing  
business conditions improve minus the percentage seeing conditions 
worsen. 
</P>
<P>
	Sentiment at small- and medium-sized manufacturers also  
improved. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen's deterioration against the dollar boosted the shares of  
export-oriented companies, products of which are made cheaper 
abroad by a weaker Japanese currency, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section closed up 3.00 points, or 0.23 percent, to 1,307.17 
points. The TOPIX rose 3.73 points, or 0.29 percent, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 558.7 million shares changed hands on the First  
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, down from 614.58 million 
shares Friday. Advancing issues outnumbered retreaters 801 to 433, 
while 95 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	On the foreign exchange market, the dollar gained on buying by  
overseas funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the release of the central bank survey had little  
effect on currency trading as the results were largely within 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The greenback was also lifted by dollar-supportive comments from  
Japanese Vice Finance Minister for International Affairs Eisuke 
Sakakibara, who reiterated today that the country's foreign 
exchange policy hasn't changed. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar traded as low as 120.43 yen and as high as 121.75 yen  
in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 130.61 yen, up from  
130.32 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.740 percent from Friday's finish of 1.730 percent, 
driving its price down to 100.51 yen from 100.60 yen.

<HEADLINE> Amazon.com, Wal-Mart Settle Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Amazon.com will reassign employees it lured away  
from Wal-Mart Stores and return computer system information to 
settle a lawsuit charging that the online bookseller tried to steal 
trade secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart sued last fall, alleging that Amazon.com hired its  
computer system managers and on-site consultants to learn more 
about the department store chain's information systems, which 
include data on sales, inventory and consumer buying habits. 
</P>
<P>
	That type of information would likely prove very useful to  
Amazon.com, which has been angling to become the Wal-Mart of the 
Internet through acquisitions that will expand the range of 
products it sells. 
</P>
<P>
	In the settlement filed Monday, Amazon.com agreed to reassign  
some of the former Wal-Mart employees to jobs that don't mirror the 
positions they held at Wal-Mart. Amazon.com also agreed to return 
information, brought over by former employees, related to 
Wal-Mart's database of customer and product information. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com already has returned ``thousands of Wal-Mart  
confidential documents,'' said Wal-Mart spokeswoman Betsy 
Reithemeyer. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no admission of wrongdoing by Amazon.com, which also  
agreed not to actively recruit any Wal-Mart employees for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	No damages are to be paid.  
</P>
<P>
	Amazom.com, which maintains it didn't steal trade secrets,  
settled the case to avoid costly and prolonged litigation, 
spokesman Bill Curry said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, doesn't sell a  
lot of products online, it views Amazon.com as a threat to its book 
sales at stores. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the suggestion that Amazon.com is gunning to become  
Wal-Mart's online equivalent may not have gone over so well, said 
Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies Research 
International, a consulting firm based in San Jose, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wal-Mart hasn't spelled out their strategy,'' Bajarin said,  
``but it's very clear if someone is going to be a Wal-Mart of 
cyberspace, they wanted to be it. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides tracking raw sales, profit margin and inventory data,  
Wal-Mart's system also documents what products consumers tend to 
buy together. 
</P>
<P>
	A database that extensive could help Amazon.com know which  
products and services would be most attractive to different 
customers, facilitating the online retailer's plan to expand into 
other areas.

	NATO Blasts Yugoslav Targets  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Keeping up airstrikes, NATO blasted  
fuel depots, bridges and army barracks throughout Yugoslavia today. 
Allied air power also struck at Serb ground forces accused of 
pushing ethnic Albanians out of Kosovo. Conditions remained dire at 
a makeshift refugee camp at Blace, Macedonia, on the border with 
Kosovo, where thousands were living in shelters of plastic and 
blankets. NATO said relief flights carrying 200 tons of food and 
other emergency supplies were on the way.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today said NATO's military  
campaign against Yugoslavia will be ``unceasing and unrelenting'' 
until President Slobodan Milosevic backs down on Kosovo. ``Our plan 
is to persist until we prevail,'' Clinton said. Defense Secretary 
William Cohen said U.S. Army Apache attack helicopters would target 
Serb military and police forces that are now ``open and 
vulnerable'' in Kosovo.

	CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands (AP) -- The United Nations suspended  
sanctions against Libya today after Moammar Gadhafi surrendered two 
suspected Libyan intelligence agents for trial in the lethal 1988 
bombing of a Pan Am jet. The handover began what could be a lengthy 
trial process in the Netherlands. ``Now, at last, the road to 
justice has begun,'' President Clinton said in a statement. The two 
Libyans were being held at this former U.S. airbase, awaiting 
arraignment under Scottish law on charges of planting the suitcase 
bomb that blew up Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 
people, including 189 Americans.

	'Junior' Gotti Pleads Guilty  
</P>
<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- John A. ``Junior'' Gotti, the son and  
alleged successor of America's best-known Mafioso, pleaded guilty 
today to racketeering, bribery, extortion and other charges in 
exchange for a prison term of up to seven years. The plea was 
entered the day before jury selection was to begin in his federal 
trial. If convicted, he could have been sentenced to 20 years in 
prison and fined millions of dollars. Gotti was charged with taking 
part in a criminal enterprise known as the Gambino family, and 
extortion, robbery, loansharking, gambling and bribery.

	Gay Attack Sentence Is Life  
</P>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- One of two men charged in the killing of  
Matthew Shepard pleaded guilty to murder, admitting he tied the gay 
college student to a fence and left him for dead. Russell Henderson 
avoided a possible death sentence with his plea. He was sentenced 
to two consecutive life terms. Authorities said Henderson and Aaron 
McKinney posed as homosexuals and lured Shepard out of a bar last 
October, kidnapped and pistol-whipped him and left him tied to a 
fence.

Wyoming drug conviction and expanded the already considerable 
police power to stop and search vehicles without a court warrant.

Economy,'' the executives wrote in an advertisement they placed in 
today's editions of the San Jose Mercury News' business section. 
Among the Bush backers are Jim Barksdale, president and CEO of

<HEADLINE> Stocks Higher; Dow Up 129.04 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology issues led the stock market sharply  
higher Monday amid signs that the economy's fast rate of growth may 
be moderating. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up  
129.04 at 9,961.55. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite index was up 31.97 at 2,493.37, just shy of  
its record close of 2,510.09 reached Feb. 1. The technology-laden 
index had traded as high as 2,539.40 earlier in the session. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also higher.  
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the Labor Department reported 46,000 new jobs were  
created in February, the smallest increase in three years. The news 
calmed investor fears that the economy was growing too fast and 
that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates to slow it 
down. The report, issued when the market was closed in observance 
of Good Friday, also said the unemployment rate fell to a 29-year 
low of 4.2 percent as wages rose less than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks once again set the tone for the session.  
</P>
<P>
	Among Dow stocks, IBM was up 4 3/8 to 181 3/8 and Hewlett-Packard rose  
3 1/4 to 71 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Nasdaq market, Yahoo! shot up 24 to 203 3/4 as traders  
anticipated a strong earnings report from the Internet company on 
Wednesday. Computer maker Dell was up 2 3/8 at 43 9/16, Sun 
Microsystems gained 3 7/16 to 129 5/8, and Microsoft was up 2 1/16 at 
94 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 17.82 at 1,311.54.  
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 405.9 million shares, 
up from Thursday's 332.92 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 6.20 at 611.19, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 5.61 at 716.91.

a hospital nursery, but the girl's biological mother is fighting 
the agreement and may seek custody of the child. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the agreement provides money for the grandparents who  
share custody of Rebecca Chittum. Her biological mother, Paula 
Johnson, who has custody of the girl Rebecca was switched with, 
believes the grandparents have no right to compensation and plans 
to appeal, her attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no reason to divert any of this money away from this  
child to the grandparents,'' Ms. Johnson's attorney, John Blakely, 
told Circuit Judge Thomas Wood. 
</P>
<P>
	The money would come from the state, which runs the University  
of Virginia Medical Center, where Rebecca and Callie Conley were 
switched in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Johnson took Callie home from the hospital, believing the  
infant was her child, and has been raising her. 
</P>
<P>
	Rebecca went home with Kevin Chittum and Whitney Rogers,  
Callie's biological parents. The couple died in a car crash last 
July 4, around the time the switch was discovered. Rebecca is being 
raised by the parents of Chittum and Ms. Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the switch was never determined.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Johnson has made no firm decision on whether to seek custody  
of Rebecca, ``but it looks like that may happen,'' Blakely said 
outside the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	``If your child were in the care of someone else,'' Blakely  
said, ``and you saw some of the money that you think should be 
going to your child going to people to whom it doesn't belong, 
you'd be upset and wonder whether or not something should be done 
about the placement of that child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No settlement agreement has been reached for Callie, and Ms.  
Johnson's attorneys said they plan to sue the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute over how much money the two children and their  
families deserve for the mix-up has ruined an informal custody and 
visitation agreement among the families. Visitations have ended, 
and feelings have soured to the point that Ms. Johnson refused to 
accept an Easter basket that one of Rebecca's grandparents wanted 
to give to Callie, their biological granddaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	``It kind of shocked me,'' said the grandmother, Brenda Rogers.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Johnson's mother, Jewel Condrey, accepted the basket after  
Monday's hearing, and gave Ms. Rogers a basket she made for 
Rebecca. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement for Rebecca includes $400,000 in a long-term  
annuity that will grow to $1.5 million over 25 years; $200,000 in a 
trust fund for Rebecca and accessible by her grandparents; $125,000 
paid directly to Rebecca's grandparents, and $150,000 in lawyers' 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
	Blakely told the judge that the settlement was insufficient and  
that at least $1 million should go solely to the child.

<HEADLINE> Japan Business Sentiment Improves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese businesses grew slightly more confident  
about the country's economy during the first quarter, but they were 
still far from optimistic about the future, according to a survey 
released by Japan's central bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan said Monday business sentiment at major  
manufacturers improved slightly during the past three months, 
rising to minus 47 in March from December's minus 49, the lowest 
figure since February 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The report suggested Japan's massive economic stimulus measures  
-- including tax cuts and increased government spending -- have begun 
to break its economic slide. But analysts said the improvement has 
not come as quickly as many had hoped. 
</P>
<P>
	``This shows that the government isn't getting too much bang for  
its yen,'' said Andrew Shipley, economist at Schroders Securities 
in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The improvement in business sentiment was the first since June  
1997. The index measures the percentage of firms seeing business 
conditions improve minus the percentage seeing conditions worsen. 
The central bank began conducting what's known as the ``tankan'' 
survey in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturers predicted their outlook would improve further by  
the time of the next survey. 
</P>
<P>
	But there were still plenty of signs that Japan economy has a  
long way to go in its recovery from its worst recession since World 
War II. Big companies surveyed forecast their capital spending 
would decline by 9.4 percent this fiscal year -- worse than their 
projections of a 5.4 percent drop for the last fiscal year, which 
ended March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``A full-fledged recovery has yet to start,'' Koji Tanami,  
Japan's top Finance Ministry official said at a press conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although the tankan showed some bright results such how people  
feel about future business conditions and the forecast for 
corporate profits, it indicated that capital investment has not 
emerged yet,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The tankan report was followed by other economic data that  
showed Japan's economy remains bogged down. 
</P>
<P>
	Average household spending tumbled 3.8 percent in December,  
further dimming hopes for an upswing in consumption, Japan's 
Management and Coordination Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the country's Economic Planning Agency said that the  
February index of leading indicators of the economy stood at 42.9, 
below the boom-or-bust threshold of 50.0 for the second straight 
month.

<HEADLINE> Two Virginia FB Players Indicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -- An Albemarle County grand jury today  
indicted two University of Virginia football players on felony 
charges in connection with a campus brawl. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior defensive back Adrian Burnim was charged with two counts  
of malicious wounding and sophomore tailback Antoine Womack was 
charged with one count of malicious wounding. 
</P>
<P>
	Another man, Kevin D. Cromartie, who isn't a Virginia student,  
was charged with one count of malicious wounding. 
</P>
<P>
	A hearing for the three was set for Aug. 11. Their attorneys  
said they will plead not guilty and request a jury trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges stem from a Feb. 7 fight in which the three were  
among five people accused of beating Virginia students Jonathan 
Dean and Cabal Thornton. 
</P>
<P>
	During an April 1 preliminary hearing, Dean and Thornton  
testified they were returning from a late-night party when five men 
attacked them. 
</P>
<P>
	Dean and Thornton said they were disoriented in the attack and  
unable to tell what happened. Dean, however, said he was sure that 
one of his attackers was Womack, who he said straddled his legs as 
he lay curled up and kicked him repeatedly in the back. 
</P>
<P>
	Thornton testified he tried to intervene on his friend's behalf  
and Burnim punched him in the face. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Burnim would face up to 40 years in prison, Womack  
and Cromartie up to 20 years each. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other football players -- Devon Simmons and John Duckett --  
pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges in the same case. Both 
Simmons and Duckett have been suspended from the football team 
indefinitely.

<HEADLINE>  Japanese Pitchers Face Major Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan has had a hard time of it lately: recession,  
unemployment and sinking corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Now even Japanese pitchers in the major leagues are getting  
hammered. 
</P>
<P>
	Hideo Nomo has fallen from rookie stardom to a Chicago Cubs  
minor league team. Hideki Irabu was denigrated by New York Yankees 
owner and dropped from the five-man rotation last week after 
struggling in spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just can't be helped,'' said fishmonger Masao Nakagawa,  
standing over racks of dried squid in his Tokyo market stall. 
``There are good times, and then there are bad times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The demotions have disappointed Japanese fans who used to watch  
TV specials with delight when a few of their own made it to 
baseball's pinnacle. 
</P>
<P>
	``A cold season for Japanese big league pitchers,'' read a  
headline last week in the national Asahi newspaper. ``For Japanese 
pitchers, jumping to the majors is getting more remote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among Japanese major leaguers, perhaps no one's star has fallen  
as far and as fast as Nomo's. 
</P>
<P>
	The right-hander broke into the big leagues in May 1995 with the  
Los Angeles Dodgers and became an overnight sensation. He won the 
National League Rookie of the Year award and led the league with 
236 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Then it all seemed to fall apart. The Dodgers traded him to the  
New York Mets last year. The Mets gave up on him after he went 0-2 
with a 7.62 ERA this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he's with Chicago's Triple-A Iowa farm team, getting just a  
handful of starts to prove himself before the Cubs decide whether 
to add him to their roster or let him go. 
</P>
<P>
	The reversal of fortune has knocked him the radar screens of  
many Japanese fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't talk much about Nomo these days,'' said Ryuichi  
Matsuda, an 18-year-old college student. 
</P>
<P>
	Irabu, meanwhile, made it to the big time after the Yankees won  
a bidding war in 1997 and signed him to a four-year, $12 million 
contract. The pitcher was 13-9 with a 4.06 ERA last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But Irabu has had a tough spring, going 0-2 with an 8.38 ERA.  
Yankees owner George Steinbrenner called him a ``fat ... toad'' 
last week, complaining about Irabu's weight (252 pounds) and lack 
of hustle. Irabu has been dropped temporarily from the starting 
rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Yankees broke camp in Florida, Irabu asked to remain  
behind ``to think about many things.'' He has since rejoined the 
club and apologized to his teammates for his absence. 
</P>
<P>
	There are a handful of other Japanese pitchers in the majors.  
Masato Yoshii is hanging on as the Mets' fifth starter after 
signing a $5 million, two-year contract in November. Shigetoshi 
Hasegawa is a reliever with the Anaheim Angels. 
</P>
<P>
	Some in Japan point to the American baseball system as a factor  
in their players' downfalls. 
</P>
<P>
	Hiromitsu Ochiai, a former player with the Yomiuri Giants,  
criticizes the way in which the Mets got rid of Nomo, saying a 
Japanese team would never release a player right before the opening 
of a season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The difference is that in Japan, we focus on how to cultivate  
a player,'' he wrote for the Weekly Asahi magazine. ``In America, 
they just try to pick the best among the players they have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kenichi Ida, a 26-year-old worker in a vegetable store in Tokyo,  
suggested that Japanese too small to compete with the bigger 
American players. 
</P>
<P>
	``Japanese body power is different from Americans,'' he said,  
gobbling down an early lunch of rice and seaweed flakes outside his 
store. ``So it's harder for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anyway, he said, baseball is not really on people's minds much  
anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're more interested here in soccer,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Rep. Urges China Donation Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Linking alleged Democratic campaign  
fund-raising abuses with a visit to Washington by China's premier, 
a member of Congress who has investigated the charges is pressing 
President Clinton to demand answers about possible Chinese 
influence on U.S. elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional investigators and the Justice Department should be  
allowed into China to interview principal witnesses, Rep. Dan 
Burton wrote Clinton on Monday. The president plays host this week 
to Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Times reported during the weekend that  
cooperating witness Johnny Chung has told Justice Department 
investigators that China's chief military intelligence officer 
ordered that $300,000 be directed to Chung for political 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton, R-Ind., chairs the House Government Reform and Oversight  
Committee, which has been investigating foreign donations in the 
1996 presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ... urge you to insist that China provide U.S. investigators  
... with bank records ... that would demonstrate the origins of the 
millions of dollars that flowed'' from China to the Democratic 
Party and the Clinton-Gore campaign, Burton wrote.

<HEADLINE> Australia Wants To Host Davis Match </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Tennis Australia will appeal to the  
International Tennis Federation in a bid to get Australia's Davis 
Cup quarterfinal against the United States switched to Melbourne. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Davis Cup rules, Australia would serve as the host of the  
match as the last game between the nations was in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the ITF decided two years ago to celebrate the 100th  
anniversary of the Davis Cup by ensuring a U.S. match would be 
played in Boston, the city where the Cup was born. 
</P>
<P>
	Scheduled for July 16-18, the tie will feature the two most  
successful countries in Cup history and commemorate the first Cup 
match between the United States and Britain in 1900, a 3-0 U.S. 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennis Australia president Geoff Pollard said the appeal would  
be based on the fact that the United States played host to the last 
match in Washington in September 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``Secondly, I believe Australia can stage a better celebration  
in Melbourne Park with a capacity crowd of 15,000 in the world's 
best tennis venue as opposed to a match in Boston with a crowd of 
5,000,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on our record, Australia has as much right to  
commemorate the centenary as the USA and therefore will appeal to 
the ITF to maintain normal home-and-away rights that have been 
integral to the competition throughout its 100-year history.''

<HEADLINE> 8 Immigrants Die of Hypothermia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Eight suspected illegal immigrants have died of  
hypothermia after a snow storm caught them by surprise while they 
prepared to cross the U.S.-Mexico border. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from the U.S. Border Control and other agencies  
rescued more than 50 immigrants late Thursday and Friday in and 
around the Cleveland National Forest, about 40 miles east of San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies of eight men, ages 20 to 32, were found Friday.  
Autopsies attributed their deaths to environmental hypothermia, 
said Dan Matticks, an investigator with the San Diego County 
medical examiner's office. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only one had on a jacket and heavier clothing. The rest of  
them had light clothes, light jackets, tennis shoes, street shoes -- 
not clothing you would want to wear in that type of weather,'' 
Matticks said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said the eight were part of a group that was  
sneaking into the United States illegally. Beefed up border patrols 
have pushed immigrants and smugglers to more dangerous routes, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 50 immigrants who were rescued, eight remained at San  
Diego hospitals, the Mexican consulate in San Diego said. The 
others have been repatriated. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven of the rescued immigrants have been detained by U.S.  
authorities, including three who are believed to be the 
``coyotes,'' or smugglers. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexican authorities working the other side of the border south  
of Tecate had reported finding an additional two people dead and 
more than 80 people stranded by the cold.

<HEADLINE> Deal To Develop Iranian Oil Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- A consortium made up of Canada's Bow Valley Energy  
Ltd. and Elf Petroleum Iran has agreed to develop Iran's offshore 
Balal oil field. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost of the project is estimated at $300 million, and the  
first oil from Balal -- some 40,000 barrels a day -- is expected in 
2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. State Department said Monday that it is ``deeply  
disappointed'' about the decision to develop Balal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. remains strongly opposed to investment in Iran's  
petroleum sector,'' State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said. 
``We have repeatedly urged the governments of France and Canada at 
the most senior levels to discourage this investment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said the administration will review the facts to determine  
whether U.S. sanctions could be applied against the two companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Balal is 60 miles southwest of Lavan Island in the Persian Gulf.  
Reserves there are estimated at 100 million barrels of ``good 
quality oil,'' France's Elf Aquitaine said in a statement Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Elf Petroleum Iran is a subsidiary of Paris-based Elf Aquitaine.  
</P>
<P>
	The consortium is to be reimbursed and paid in crude oil in the  
six-year contract with Iran's national oil company, the statement 
said.

<HEADLINE> Rising Raptors Turn Into Contenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Take one of the NBA's worst teams, add two tough  
old-timers and one scintillating rookie, flip into a new arena, 
then sizzle until red-hot. 
</P>
<P>
	That recipe has transformed the Toronto Raptors into a  
legitimate playoff contender for the first time in their four-year 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	They are playing the first meaningful NBA games ever in Canada --  
and have won a franchise-record six straight, including 
down-to-the-buzzer victories over San Antonio and Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	After three-plus seasons housed in Toronto's cavernous SkyDome,  
the Raptors moved to the new Air Canada Centre on Feb. 21. Since 
then, they've gone 11-2 at home, and Raptors tickets are suddenly 
as coveted as NHL tickets for the playoff-bound Toronto Maple 
Leafs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a vendetta against the entire league because just  
about everybody has beat on us,'' reserve forward John Wallace 
said. ``Now, we're the team doing a little laughing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fans had modest hopes for this abbreviated season, suspecting a  
reprise of the 16-66 record in 1997-98. 
</P>
<P>
	But top draft choice Vince Carter has blossomed rapidly into a  
star, and is the clear favorite for rookie of the year. He leads 
the team in scoring with 17.6 points a game and dominates local 
sports-show highlights with his gyrations around the rim. 
</P>
<P>
	But Carter's brilliance alone wouldn't have gotten the Raptors  
where they are now, in seventh place in the Eastern Conference at 
18-14. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Oakley and Kevin Willis, two tested and tough big men,  
were acquired during the offseason, going from title contenders to 
the seemingly hapless Raptors. 
</P>
<P>
	They injected the team with the most crucial missing ingredient  
-- a strong work ethic, a willingness to wage trench warfare game 
after game, regardless of the score. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakley's statistics aren't glamorous, but he just might be more  
valuable to the Raptors than he ever was to the New York Knicks, 
inspiring gritty play from his mostly young teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	Willis, the former Houston Rocket in his 15th NBA season, has  
struggled with a shoulder injury the past month, but nonetheless 
has been the most solid center the Raptors have ever had. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's there for everybody,'' backup guard Dee Brown said.  
``Kevin lets everyone know when they do a good job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown has been vital to the offense with his 3-point shooting  
off the bench. Starting guard Doug Christie, the longest-serving 
Raptor, is the league leader in steals and No. 2 on the team in 
scoring with 14.7 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
	Butch Carter, in his first full season as a head coach, also has  
made effective use of Wallace and reserve swingman Tracy McGrady. 
Each is averaging more than eight points a game. 
</P>
<P>
	Vince Carter is the one who electrifies the crowds -- mixing  
3-pointers with twisting layups and emphatic dunks, seemingly 
gaining energy in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday night, his defense was pivotal in an 87-85 victory  
over Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Wizards star Mitch Richmond took an inbounds pass with 10  
seconds left and maneuvered for a winning or tying shot. 
</P>
<P>
	But Carter stayed with Richmond to prevent a drive, then leapt  
when Richmond tried a long shot, disrupting the release. The ball 
never hit the rim. 
</P>
<P>
	Willis put his arm around Carter after the game and walked him  
down the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knows his defense has to be there to be a well-rounded  
player,'' Willis said. ``I just wanted to make sure he knew. He 
knows what he can be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Sunday's home-court win over Philadelphia, Oakley was  
asked how it felt to be ahead of the Knicks in the standings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking down on a lot of teams,'' he said. ``We can't  
brag, or this or that. We've just got to play ball every night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Oakley, who becomes a free agent at the end of the  
season, said he was unhappy with the team's offer of a contract 
extension, reportedly $12 million over three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would take a better offer than they offered me before,'' he  
said when asked what it would take for him to remain in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they offered me I think was embarrassing. ... If that's  
what they're going to be offering me, I won't be staying. I would 
rather go somewhere else for less.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Raptors general manager Glen Grunwald wasn't available for  
comment Monday. He's currently on a European scouting trip.

<HEADLINE> MLB Matchup: Johnson Vs. Brown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Coming your way today: the Big Unit and his  
blazing fastball against the sidewinding Georgian and his nasty 
slider. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening day at Dodger Stadium features Randy Johnson of the  
Arizona Diamondbacks against Kevin Brown of the Los Angeles 
Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	A dream matchup, for sure.  
</P>
<P>
	Runs will no doubt be at a premium, just as they were last fall  
when Johnson and Brown squared off in the opener of the NL division 
series between the Houston Astros and San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	The final score? 2-1, Padres.  
</P>
<P>
	``Imagine that,'' Dodgers catcher Todd Hundley said with a  
smile. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to some big bucks, Johnson and Brown have changed teams  
since their last meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brown vs. the Unit; opening day,'' Hundley said. ``It's going  
to be fun. If I was going to go to an opening day, ours is the one 
I'd go to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The game has been a sellout for weeks, and much anticipated  
since Johnson signed a $52.4 million, four-year contract with the 
Diamondbacks on Nov. 30, and Brown became baseball's richest player 
when he signed a $105 million, seven-year deal with the Dodgers 12 
days later. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good for baseball, to have two of the most dominant  
pitchers in the game throw against each other on opening day,'' Los 
Angeles second baseman Eric Young said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never faced him before,'' Dodgers shortstop Mark  
Grudzielanek said of Johnson. ``The biggest thing I think is you 
can't be overwhelmed by him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's easier said than done when the time comes to face the  
6-foot-10 left-hander. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown might not be 6-10, but facing him is no walk in the park,  
either. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no question he's one of the best pitchers in the  
league,'' Grudzielanek said. ``He's tough, he's not making that 
kind of money for nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grudzielanek was speaking about Johnson; he just as easily could  
have been talking about Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	While Johnson has been baseball's dominant left-hander in the  
1990s, mostly with the Seattle Mariners, Brown has been one of the 
toughest right-handers, especially the last three years, when he's 
gone 51-26 with a major league-best 2.33 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, who helped the Florida Marlins and Padres reach the World  
Series in the last two years, was 18-7 with a 2.38 ERA in 1998 and 
could become the first pitcher to appear in three consecutive World 
Series with three different teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, that's his goal for this year.  
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, 10-1 with a 1.28 ERA after the Astros acquired him from  
Seattle last July 31, said he still feels honored to pitch on 
opening day, and expects a playoff-type environment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been in that atmosphere, whether it's been in the  
playoffs or the All-Star games,'' he said. ``I have a job to do and 
I don't get caught up in all of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As far as facing Brown is concerned, Johnson said, ``I've faced  
him once before and just thought it was a very well-pitched game by 
both of us, and I'm imagining it's going to be the same thing on 
opening day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown downplayed the duel.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not pitching against him, although I'll face him at least  
a couple times,'' Brown said. ``I've got to get those other guys 
out. My job's still the same. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks are hoping for significant improvement in just  
their second year of existence, while the retooled Dodgers are 
favored to win the NL West. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm real excited,'' Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said.  
``We've had a great spring. Now, we've got to prove that we're a 
good club.''

<HEADLINE> Twins Guarantee Win in Jays Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Mark it down. The Minnesota Twins will beat  
the Toronto Blue Jays in their season opener. In fact, they've 
guaranteed it. 
</P>
<P>
	Undaunted by a bargain-basement roster that includes 10 rookies,  
the Twins have come up with a gutsy marketing plan that 
``guarantees'' a win each Tuesday night this season. 
</P>
<P>
	If the players don't come through, each fan's ticket stub is  
worth a free seat to a future home game any day except Fridays and 
Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
	Considering the Twins' inexperience, that could make the opener  
a 2-for-1 night for the more than 40,000 fans expected Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Which guy in the front office is playing tomorrow night,'' Ron  
Coomer quipped Monday as he dressed for the Twins' last preseason 
workout. ``They've got to do whatever they've got to do to sell 
tickets. That's fine by me. I don't care what they do. Our job is 
down on the field. We help out as much as we can to do what they 
need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It would help the marketing strategy considerably to beat Pat  
Hentgen on Tuesday and David Wells on Wednesday. But that's a tough 
draw for Minnesota's kiddie corps. 
</P>
<P>
	Hentgen, the 1996 AL Cy Young winner and a 15-game winner in  
1997, slumped to 12-11 with a 5.17 ERA last season. He's looking to 
make Tuesday the start of a more Hentgen-esque season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time you get opening day it's a great honor,'' said  
Hentgen, 82-53 with a 3.88 ERA in six seasons. ``Considering our 
staff right now, I think on paper we've got one of the better ones 
in the AL.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Especially if Wells keeps rolling.  
</P>
<P>
	The burly, bawdy lefty pitched a perfect game against the Twins  
at Yankee Stadium last season and led New York to the World Series 
title. He was bothered by a sore back shortly after the trade that 
sent Roger Clemens to the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells, who will face rookie Mike Lincoln on Wednesday night,  
doesn't like the idea of facing so many young guys to start the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Usually when you first come up and you go against a good team,  
you usually come out on top,'' Wells said. ``But not me. I lost. I 
lost to the Yankees in 1987 and `The Gator' (Ron Guidry). I just 
hope Lincoln's off Wednesday and we kick some butt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lincoln is one of seven Twins who spent all or most of last  
season at Double-A New Britain. He led the Rock Cats in wins (15) 
and innings (173 1-3), and his 3.22 ERA was the lowest among the 
team's starters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rock Cats had an outstanding season, finishing 83-59, and  
the players hope that success and their familiarity with one 
another will help them make the leap to the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know the feeling of winning and losing together. We know  
what one guy can do and what he can't do,'' said Torii Hunter, who 
spent six games with the Twins last season and outplayed Jacque 
Jones and Chris Latham to win the center-field job. ``It's not like 
this team is just made up of players from another organization. We 
grew up together, so we should be able to play together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday night's crowd should be close to the 43,848 who saw the  
'98 opener, the largest crowd for an opener in Minnesota since 
1993. Season ticket sales also are expected to top last year's 
6,043 by about 1,000, thanks mostly to a $99 special. 
</P>
<P>
	The fans seem at least mildly interested in the fresh start  
created by this year's cost cutting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to be in the minor leagues,'' Hunter said.  
``We're hungry. We want to stay here. So gives us a chance. We'll 
give you 100 percent. Nothing less.''

<HEADLINE> Alleged Subway Pusher Fit for Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A man who has said ghosts inhabit and control  
his body is mentally fit to stand trial on charges he killed a 
woman by pushing her in front of a subway train, a judge ruled 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Carol Berkman ruled that Andrew Goldstein, 29, can  
understand the charges and court proceedings and help his lawyer 
present a defense. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said the state's standard for finding a person  
mentally fit is ``not particularly high,'' and Goldstein, who has a 
10-year history of mental illness, is ``not so impaired that he 
cannot participate in his trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goldstein is charged with second-degree murder in the death of  
Kendra Webdale, 32. Goldstein told police and psychiatrists that 
voices told him to shove Ms. Webdale and that an irresistible 
``ghost'' or ``spirit'' took control of his body just before the 
push.

<HEADLINE> Braves' Wohlers Falters in Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The scene was familiar: Mark Wohlers trotting in  
from the Atlanta Braves' bullpen in the ninth inning of a tight 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately for Wohlers, he still doesn't resemble the pitcher  
who once dominated the late innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers, trying to rebound from a disastrous season, walked four  
and gave up two runs in two-thirds of an inning today as the Braves 
lost their opener to Philadelphia 7-4. Afterward, he cursed at 
reporters in the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to dissect everything I do,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	That's hardly a realistic stance. Wohlers, who saved 97 games  
for the Braves from 1995-97, inexplicably lost sight of the strike 
zone last season. He had a 10.18 ERA for the Braves, walking 33 in 
20 1-3 innings, and was even worse after going back to Triple-A 
Richmond -- 36 walks in 12 1-3 innings and a 20.43 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	After struggling in the early weeks of spring training, Wohlers  
seemed to regain in his form as the season neared, earning a spot 
on the 25-man roster. He retired the Cleveland Indians 1-2-3 in the 
final exhibition game to earn his second save of the spring. 
</P>
<P>
	In the opener, Atlanta trailed the Phillies 5-4 going to the  
ninth when manager Bobby Cox summoned Wohlers from the bullpen to 
keep the game close. The reliever received a thunderous, standing 
ovation from the 47,522 fans at Turner Field and needed only one 
pitch to get the first out, Mike Lieberthal's grounder to short. 
</P>
<P>
	Desi Relaford then walked on four pitches and stole second  
before pinch-hitter Kevin Jordan grounded to third. Chipper Jones 
threw out the hitter at first, but Relaford broke for third and 
trotted home when first baseman Ryan Klesko made a high throw back 
across the diamond trying to get the runner. 
</P>
<P>
	The error seemed to unnerve Wohlers, who walked Doug Glanville  
before Marlon Anderson doubled off the center-field wall to bring 
home another run. Wohlers walked the next two hitters, Scott Rolen 
and Rico Brogna, and Cox mercifully emerged from the dugout to 
remove the pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers threw 31 pitches -- only 11 were strikes.  
</P>
<P>
	``We put him in a very important situation and the strike zone  
got away from him,'' Cox said. ``We'll have to wait and see. He 
threw so many good innings during spring training, I'd hate to say 
it all went for naught. We'll get him in some more situations and 
hope we can get him back to where he was during spring training.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves are desperately seeking a closer now that Kerry  
Ligtenberg, who save 30 games as a rookie, is out for the season 
with an injured elbow. John Rocker, who got the final out after 
Wohlers faltered, seems the most likely candidate unless a trade is 
made. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers had a scowl on his face when he emerged from the  
training room and saw some 20 reporters waiting at his locker. He 
was testy from the very first question. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't throw strikes,'' he said. ``That's what happened. I  
felt like I was in a good frame of mind. I thought I was throwing 
good. I just didn't throw strikes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, he said, ``Other guys go through these things. They're  
just not as magnified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers said he appreciated the support of the fans, who still  
cheered (though not as loud) as he left the mound. But he cut short 
the interview session when a reporter, saying he couldn't hear in 
the crowded setting, asked the pitcher to repeat his comments to 
one of the questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers muttered several profanities and stalked away.

<HEADLINE> High Court To Review Death Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to review the  
death sentence of a convicted Virginia killer whose scheduled 
Tuesday execution it postponed last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices said they will decide whether death row inmate  
Terry Williams should get a federal court hearing on his claims 
that he was denied adequate legal help during his sentencing trial. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision is not expected until sometime next year, so today's  
brief order postponed Williams' execution indefinitely. If the 
court eventually rules against Williams, however, Virginia 
authorities would be free to set a new execution date. 
</P>
<P>
	The court on Friday had ordered Williams' execution postponed  
until it could consider his appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the issues the justices are to study is whether Williams  
should be required to prove that he would have received a life 
prison term instead of a death sentence if he had had an effective 
lawyer at the sentencing trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, 43, has been on death row for more than 13 years --  
longer than any of the 40 Virginia prisoners currently housed 
there. He was sentenced to death for the robbery and murder of a 
Danville man in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Williams vs. Taylor, 98-8384.

<HEADLINE> Flyers' Lindros Still in Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Doctors won't know until midweek when  
hospitalized Flyers captain Eric Lindros can return to 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	And it will take several more days to determine if his collapsed  
lung mends fast enough to let him skate in the playoffs that start 
in less than three weeks, Flyers team physician Dr. Gary Dorshimer 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorshimer said those answers depend on what happens after  
doctors at Nashville's Baptist Hospital discontinue the suction in 
a tube in Lindros' chest to determine if the lung can remain 
inflated without the assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	Still in pain from the injury, Lindros had hoped to return for  
the playoffs, refusing to ``rule anything out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though there was speculation Lindros was injured when hit during  
the Flyers' 2-1 win Thursday night at Nashville, he said he felt 
pain but didn't think it was serious. ``I went out and had a 
cheeseburger and fries,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later Thursday and early Friday, Dorshimer said Lindros  
experienced ``a progressive feeling of weakness, tiredness and 
shortness of breath and then eventually lightheadedness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the lightheadedness, a Flyers spokesman disputed a USA  
Today report Monday that Lindros had collapsed in his Nashville 
hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is a matter of semantics. I don't think he  
collapsed, but he was taken by ambulance'' to the hospital, team 
spokesman Joe Klueg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros felt chest pains Friday. Roommate Keith Jones told The  
Philadelphia Inquirer that Lindros was ``a hurtin' pup'' by the 
time Jones called Flyers trainer John Worley, who called the 
ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorshimer said Lindros did not appear to have a broken rib or  
punctured lung, but apparently broke a blood vessel. Blood seeping 
into his chest cavity caused his right lung to collapse.

	Libyan Suspects Handed Over  
</P>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Libya handed over two suspects today for  
trial in the 1988 Pan Am airliner bombing that killed 270 people. 
Lamen Khalifa Fhimah and Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi are to be 
tried under Scottish law in the Netherlands. The move is expected 
to lead to the withdrawal of sanctions against Libya that barred 
international air travel to and from the North African nation. Most 
of the passengers aboard Pan Am Flight 103 were American and 
British, and the United States had insisted for a decade that the 
men be tried in the United States or Britain. It dropped the demand 
last August.

<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO airstrikes hit Serb targets  
today that reportedly included an air force building, army barracks 
and the capital's airport in the 13th day of bombing against 
Yugoslavia. The latest attacks also took out a bridge and both ends 
of a railway tunnel in an area where Serb tanks and troops are 
believed to be on the move. The attacks signal an escalation of 
firepower to halt Serb attacks on Kosovo's Albanian majority.

	US Sends Helicopters to Kosovo

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- NATO leaders will meet later today to discuss  
how to use Apache attack helicopters the United States is sending 
to Kosovo. The choppers will be used to launch direct attacks 
against Serb troops and tanks. The helicopters would be based in 
Albania. The United States also plans to send 18 multiple rocket 
launchers and 2,000 soldiers to protect the weapons and their 
crews. While foggy and rainy weather has hampered NATO air strikes, 
the Apaches fly in all weather conditions. A Pentagon spokesman 
says it would take up to 10 days to deploy the Apaches from their 
base in Germany.

	BEIJING (AP) -- China has banned a prominent dissident from  
returning home to visit the grave of his late father. Wang Xizhe is 
renowned in China's dissident circles, with 25 years of activism. 
He was stopped from boarding a South Korean airlines jet. Wang's 
attempt to go to Beijing was seen as a test of a blacklist of 
exiled activists. In protest, Wang unfurled a sign. ``The right to 
return home cannot be taken away!'' it read in Chinese, according 
to exiled dissidents who spoke with Wang.

<HEADLINE> Protests Held at Gay Death Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- Young people dressed as angels stood  
silently today outside the courthouse where one of the man accused 
of killing a gay student is on trial, trying to block from view a 
group of anti-gay demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the ring of a dozen angels organized by friends of slain  
university student Matthew Shepard, about a dozen anti-gay 
demonstrators from Kansas shouted slogans and waved signs, 
including one that said ``God Hates Fags.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``These ... creatures are sending this nation to hell in a  
handbasket,'' said the Rev. Fred Phelps of Westboro Baptist Church 
in Topeka, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	Phelps and members of his church picketed Shepard's funeral in  
Casper with anti-gay signs. They also demonstrated at a vigil in 
Alabama for Billy Jack Gaither, who may have been murdered because 
he was gay. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the courthouse, jury selection for the trial of Russell  
Henderson was delayed until Tuesday because of an afternoon hearing 
today. Opening arguments were slated for Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson, 21, is charged with first-degree murder, kidnapping  
and aggravated robbery in the attack on Shepard, a University of 
Wyoming student who was found barely alive, bloodied and tied to a 
fence Oct. 7. Shepard died five days later. 
</P>
<P>
	The subject of the hearing was not disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
	It could be for any of a number of issues, including a plea  
bargain, questions about jury selection, or a request for a new 
attorney for Henderson, said Jason Tangeman, attorney for 
codefendant Aaron McKinney. 
</P>
<P>
	A handful of police officers formed a buffer zone between the  
two groups of demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could no longer sit idly by and watch others bring forth  
messages that were nothing more than vindictive and hate-filled,'' 
said Romaine Patterson, 21, a friend of Shepard's who organized the 
angels' counterdemonstration. ``As a young person, I feel it is 
necessary to show the great nation that we live in that there 
doesn't need to be this kind of violence and hatred in our world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney, 21, faces an August trial in Shepard's killing.

<HEADLINE> Padres To Hoist NL Pennant Tomorrow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- After getting their international duties -- and  
first loss -- out of the way, the San Diego Padres have one more day 
of hoopla before getting on with their season of change. 
</P>
<P>
	With a crowd of more than 60,000 expected, the Padres will raise  
the 1998 NL pennant at Qualcomm Stadium and the players will 
receive their league championship rings before their home opener 
Tuesday afternoon against the Colorado Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It should be neat,'' general manager Kevin Towers said. ``You  
don't get that opportunity that often, to put a National League 
championship ring on your finger. It will certainly bring back some 
fond memories, once you get back to Qualcomm and see the sellout 
crowd, and get the music going again, it's going to get the 
adrenaline flying once again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was at Qualcomm Stadium where the best season in club history  
ended with losses in Games 3 and 4 of the World Series to the New 
York Yankees. Gone from that Padres team are Kevin Brown, Greg 
Vaughn, Ken Caminiti, Steve Finley and Joey Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego's most famous offseason acquisition was country singer  
Garth Brooks, who attended spring training as a non-roster player 
in part to help jump-start his baseball-related Touch 'Em All 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	The singing cowboy's gone his separate way, and now it's the  
Padres who could use a kick-start after their anemic showing in an 
8-2 loss to the Rockies on Sunday night in Monterrey, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Padres, including batting star Tony Gwynn, weren't thrilled  
at having to make a 2,000-mile round trip to play the opener as the 
``home'' team. 
</P>
<P>
	``You only have one opener,'' Gwynn said before Sunday's game.  
``In our case we were supposed to open at home. That's what you're 
supposed to do, you're supposed to raise the flag, get your rings, 
kind of celebrate what happened here last year, the start of 
something new this year. We've got to do it on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand baseball going global. I understand planting our  
flag in new places, but our flag's already planted here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres and Rockies were invited to move the game to  
Monterrey by major league baseball, which billed it as the 
International Opener. The Padres were picked in part because 
they're the defending NL champions and because they moved a series 
to Monterrey in 1996, and one to Honolulu in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	But they were hardly ambassadors of good baseball Sunday night,  
allowing 18 hits while collecting just six themselves, including 
Gwynn's RBI single that left him 71 short of 3,000 hits. Andy 
Ashby, who moved up to ace after Brown signed his $105 million 
contract with Los Angeles, was knocked out after failing to get an 
out in the five-run second. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't give us a chance to win,'' Ashby said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies had a great time, as Dante Bichette went 4-for-5  
with four RBIs and a homer, and Mexican hero Vinny Castilla also 
went 4-for-5. Their ace, Darryl Kile, got off to a good start after 
a miserable 1998, helping make Jim Leyland a winner in his debut as 
Colorado's manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Padres left-hander Sterling Hitchcock, MVP of the NL  
championship series win over Atlanta, will start Tuesday for the 
Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock wouldn't discuss his assignment. ``I don't talk before  
I pitch,'' he said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock started last year in the bullpen because the Padres  
didn't have a healthy lefty there, and now he's the No. 2 starter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies will start Pedro Astacio, who is 6-1 with a 2.55 ERA  
in 15 career games against San Diego.

<HEADLINE> US Finds Stainless Steel Is Dumped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration moved a step closer  
to slapping punitive tariffs on Japan, Spain and four other 
countries Monday with a ruling that they illegally price some 
stainless steel in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Shipments of stainless round wire from those countries would be  
subject to tariffs of as much as 36 percent if an independent 
fact-finding agency determines that their pricing practices have 
injured or could injure U.S. producers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department ruling represents the latest in a string  
of victories for the U.S. steel industry, which has yet to lose a 
key ruling in trade complaints filed to combat low-priced imports. 
</P>
<P>
	Those successes paradoxically have made it more difficult for  
domestic producers to put foreign steel products under quotas or 
stronger sanctions to fend off imports blamed for thousands of 
layoffs and bankruptcies at three U.S. companies. Administration 
officials cite the favorable rulings as evidence the normal 
administrative process works. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten U.S. manufacturers sought tariffs a year ago, accusing  
Canada, India, Japan, South Korea, Spain and Taiwan of dumping 
round wire in the U.S. market at prices below production costs or 
home-market prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Stainless steel round wire, used to produce springs, wire rope  
and fasteners in construction and other applications, represents a 
small portion of the overall steel industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Monday's dumping determination by the Commerce  
Department adds to relief the U.S. steel industry could get in 
response to the import surge. 
</P>
<P>
	A crucial decision covering the most common steel product,  
hot-rolled carbon steel, is due this month. The Commerce Department 
already has found evidence of dumping by Japan, Russia and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan and Brazil face steel tariffs in the hot-rolled case,  
while Russia has agreed to curb exports instead of similar tariffs. 
A U.S. comment period for implementing the Russian agreement closed 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. International Trade Commission is to rule by mid-May on  
whether round wire dumping has or could hurt the U.S. industry. 
That's the last step before tariffs are imposed. 
</P>
<P>
	Tariffs proposed by the Commerce Department ranged from 3  
percent for stainless round wire from South Korea to 36 percent for 
the product from Spain's main producer. Japanese round wire could 
be subject to tariffs of up to 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Stainless steel round wire is a $300 million-a-year domestic  
industry, and imports add another $100 million, industry officials 
said. Shipments from the six countries under Commerce Department 
scrutiny account for one-third of all imports. 
</P>
<P>
	The government already has imposed tariffs on stainless wire  
rod, the precursor to round wire, and has found six countries 
guilty of dumping stainless plates in coils, which could lead to 
more tariffs if injury is proven. Other complaints are pending. 
</P>
<P>
	The cases acted on Monday were filed by ACS Industries Inc. of  
Woonsocket, R.I.; Al Tech Specialty Steel Corp. of Dunkirk, N.Y.; 
Branford Wire &AMP; Manufacturing Co. of Mountain Home, N.C.; Carpenter 
Technology Corp. of Reading, Pa.; Handy &AMP; Herman Specialty Wire 
Group of Cockeysville, Md; Industrial Alloys Inc. of Pomona, Calif; 
Loos &AMP; Co. Inc. of Pomfret, Conn.; Sandvik Steel Co. of Clarks 
Summit, Pa.; Sumiden Wire Products Corp. of Stockton, Calif.; and 
Techalloy Co. Inc. of Mahwah, N.J.

<HEADLINE>  White House Holds Easter Egg Roll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Alexander Hamilton was eager to compete in the  
Easter egg roll at the White House. When the whistle blew, the 
3-year-old inched his egg forward with a plastic spoon. Then he 
froze in his tracks and frowned. 
</P>
<P>
	Adult-sized bunnies scampering across the South Lawn, noisy  
children rolling eggs, dads with cameras, the Marine Band -- it was 
all too overwhelming for the tyke from Round Hill, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like that game,'' said Alexander, who stood at that  
moment closer to the White House than his famous namesake ever did. 
</P>
<P>
	Young Alexander defiantly crossed hs arms and refused to budge  
his egg. His mother, Nora Hamilton, finished the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``Come on,'' she whispered. ``Let's see what the bunnies look  
like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dads pushing strollers, moms wearing fuzzy pink bunny ears and  
children toting Easter baskets showed up Monday at the White House 
for the annual Easter egg roll. Standing on a stage decorated with 
brightly colored tulips, President Clinton and first lady Hillary 
Rodham Clinton greeted the crowd of an estimated 30,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The president urged families to pray for troops and refugees  
involved in the Balkan crisis. He also thanked volunteers and the 
White House staff for dyeing 7,200 eggs for the event. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's more than we ask them to prepare for a state dinner,''  
joked Clinton, who wore a navy tie decorated with Easter eggs. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, with children poised at starting lines, the president  
shouted ``On your mark, ready, set go!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The egg roll has been an American tradition since the mid-19th  
century. The celebration took place on the Capitol grounds until 
1878, when it was moved to the White House by Lucy Hayes, wife of 
President Rutherford B. Hayes. 
</P>
<P>
	Drizzle and a chilly breeze dampened the start of this year's  
event, but by noon, the sun had poked through and skies were a 
picture-perfect blue. 
</P>
<P>
	Cameras and camcorders were everywhere. Children were  
photographed in front of the White House, stuffing their mouths 
with candy, dancing to music, rolling in the green grass and 
listening to stories, including one read by actress Jamie Lee 
Curtis. They also posed for snapshots with a bunny wearing a purple 
pinafore and with actors dressed up like Presidents George 
Washington and Teddy Roosevelt. 
</P>
<P>
	Billy Muran, 6, of Brookville, N.Y., rolled his egg to the  
finish line with ease before stirring up some mischief. He took his 
spoon and pummeled his purplish-colored egg into the damp grass. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Duff, 5, of Richmond, Va. didn't roll his egg. He rested it  
in his plastic spoon and slid the spoon across the grass. That 
wasn't the idea, but he got applause for his innovative approach. 
</P>
<P>
	Taron Stiney, 6, of Washington, D.C., wielded his spoon like a  
golf club. A couple of chip shots later and his pink egg rolled 
across the finish line. Busy trying to break open a plastic egg 
filled with a candy prize, Taron had little interest in discussing 
the finer points of his egg-rolling technique. 
</P>
<P>
	``He loves Easter,'' said his mother, Zaraider Stiney. ``What  
kid doesn't?''

<HEADLINE> Ameritech Sells Cellular Units </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Ameritech Corp. is selling its cellular business  
in three states to GTE Corp. for $3.27 billion to help satisfy 
federal stipulations for Ameritech's merger with SBC 
Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale of the businesses in the Chicago and St. Louis areas  
and northwestern Indiana is contingent upon regulatory approval of 
the SBC deal, Ameritech said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department recently gave the green light to that  
deal with the condition that the two Baby Bells sell off wireless 
properties in areas where they have overlapping operations that 
would dominate the market. 
</P>
<P>
	But last week, the government's top telecommunications regulator  
said he has ``serious concerns'' about the deal, which would create 
the nation's largest local phone company. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Communications Commission Chairman Bill Kennard sent  
letters to SBC and Ameritech on Thursday asking to hold talks this 
month to explore ``whether it would be possible to craft 
conditions'' addressing his concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	The properties being sold to GTE will be operated by Georgetown  
Partners, a minority-owned firm that will own a 7 percent stake in 
the businesses being sold. 
</P>
<P>
	``This sale demonstrates that the SBC-Ameritech merger will  
bring substantial new competition into the Midwest (and) broaden 
the ownership of these properties to include greater diversity from 
the community,'' Ameritech chief executive Richard Notebaert said. 
</P>
<P>
	GTE said the acquisitions would make it the largest cellular  
service provider in the United States in terms of subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	Combined with a pending purchase from Bell Atlantic, the  
purchase would give GTE 13 million cellular customers and a 
presence in two-thirds of the largest U.S. markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``These properties will both enhance our ability to bundle  
products and services in areas where we also offer local phone 
service and facilitate expansion into the local phone markets in 
key Midwest cities such as Chicago and St. Louis,'' GTE Chairman 
Charles Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio-based SBC and Chicago-based Ameritech announced  
plans to merge last May. The proposed stock deal, now worth more 
than $60 billion, has the approval of shareholders from both 
companies and several major unions. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal also must be cleared by the Illinois Commerce  
Commission and the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio.

<HEADLINE> Journalist Gary Blonston Dies at 56 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gary Blonston, chief of the Knight Ridder  
Washington bureau whose journalism career spanned more than three 
decades, died Sunday at his home of cancer. He was 56. 
</P>
<P>
	Blonston served as reporter, editor and writing coach in his  
nearly 36 years in the field. He worked at The Miami Herald, the 
Detroit Free Press and the San Jose Mercury News before coming to 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan Wolman, former Washington bureau chief of The  
Associated Press and now the AP's managing editor, said of 
Blonston: ``He ran one of the best bureaus in town, constantly 
juggling between hard news coverage and the sort of perspective 
pieces that newspapers need from Washington. He had a refined sense 
of irony, just what you need to make sense of it all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blonston was a principal writer on two Pulitzer Prize-winning  
projects. One was during his time at the Free Press, where he came 
under gunfire while covering Detroit's 1967 riots. Blonston also 
worked on the Mercury News' reporting of the 1989 Loma Prieta 
earthquake in the San Francisco Bay area. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1968, Blonston found himself in the middle of rioting  
protesters and police officers outside the Democratic National 
Convention. Coughing from tear gas, he dictated his story to an 
editor on deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Blonston also freelanced for newspapers and magazines, on topics  
ranging from politics to prehistoric art. During a 1967 strike at 
the Free Press -- when Blonston was working at Chrysler Corp. -- he 
wrote a book on the history of the Plymouth. In 1996, he published 
``William Morris,'' a book about a famed glass blower. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Iverson, Brown Working on Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Allen Iverson and Larry Brown met Monday to  
try to sort out their differences. 
</P>
<P>
	Sound familiar?  
</P>
<P>
	Once again, the Philadelphia 76ers star and his coach came out  
of it with nice things to say about each other but no indication 
their rocky relationship will change. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson, still out with a severely bruised thigh, did not  
practice and is not expected to play Tuesday night against 
Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	He was on court for a brief shootaround at the end of the team's  
workout at a suburban college, then talked with Brown for 20 to 30 
minutes before both emerged to discuss their latest attempt at a 
truce. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting with a recitation of one-word answers about the  
meeting, Iverson eventually opened up about the most recent 
skirmish between the NBA's leading scorer and an old-school coach 
who appears to be running out of patience. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have any problems,'' said Iverson, who hasn't played  
since a heated exchange with Brown during a game against Cleveland 
on Friday night. ``It's no big thing. It's just something that's 
blown all out of proportion. If y'all think that Larry Brown and 
myself are not going to have any altercations, I mean that's crazy. 
That's ridiculous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown also had words with Iverson's bodyguard after practice  
Monday. The coach kicked Terry Royster out of the locker room after 
the Cleveland game. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson did not play the opening 2:03 of the second quarter  
against the Cavaliers after going 0-for-7 in the first quarter. 
When Brown told Iverson to go back into the game, Iverson, 
according to courtside reporters, muttered an obscenity. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Iverson denied that and recycled an explanation for  
his relationship with Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking at different things on TV and in the paper, and  
they're saying things that I didn't even say,'' Iverson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once you throw my name in the mix with something negative, I  
mean it just explodes,'' he added. ``... That's what y'all need to 
sell papers. That's what y'all need for people to look at your show 
or whatever. Y'all need that energy. Y'all need that negativity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said Iverson always barks something at him when he's taken  
out of a game. What was different this time was a ``second 
response'' from Iverson when the coach tried to put him back in the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time I've taken Allen out since I've been here, I've had  
the same response,'' Brown said. ``And I understand. He just wants 
to play. He doesn't understand how it affects maybe his teammates 
or me. ... I don't think it's going to change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson played for two weeks after hurting his right thigh in a  
collision with the Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal on March 19. He told 
the trainer he couldn't play in the second half against Cleveland, 
and the 76ers lost 85-80 without him. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson skipped the team's one-game road trip to Toronto on  
Sunday, and the 76ers lost 97-82 -- their second straight loss and 
seventh in nine games as they continue to plummet out of the 
playoff picture. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Mahorn denied a report that he and other 76ers players had  
to talk Iverson out of leaving the arena at halftime of the 
Cleveland game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was nothing like that,'' Mahorn said. ``It was just us  
corralling the wagons together and saying, `We're all together for 
the long haul.' It's nothing where anybody's better than the other 
person. We all have to take care of our jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, looking more and more exasperated every day, and general  
manager Billy King have defended Iverson against any suggestion 
that he's healthy enough to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I take offense to people who say that he's not hurt,'' King  
said. ``Basically, they're calling us as an organization liars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson said his leg stiffened when Brown sat him back down  
against the Cavaliers. 
</P>
<P>
	How long Brown and Iverson can coexist this way is the biggest  
question facing the team. Since Brown was hired last year, they've 
quarreled about playing time, coaching style and missed practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson signed a $70.9 million, six-year contract in January,  
proclaiming past differences with Brown over. 
</P>
<P>
	Obviously, they're not.

<HEADLINE> US Eyes More Contraceptive Choices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In Germany, women can use a handheld computer  
to determine when sex most risks pregnancy: It flashes red if the 
woman should avoid intercourse, green if there's little chance 
she's fertile that day. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian women can slip in a little contraceptive sponge before  
sex. European women have access to a hormone-releasing IUD that 
prevents pregnancy for five years, dramatically lowers menstrual 
blood loss and even is touted to shrink fibroids. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't look for such options in a U.S. pharmacy yet, but they may  
be coming in a few years. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say the United States has been left behind as other  
countries embrace new contraceptives that provide women more 
choices in birth control. More than half a dozen new options deemed 
important by family planning experts sell abroad but not here. The 
last unique contraceptive to win U.S. approval was the female 
condom in 1993. In fact, sterilization is the leading American 
birth control. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea that the United States could be so many years behind  
other countries is pretty astonishing,'' said Dr. Felicia Stewart, 
a contraception expert at the Kaiser Family Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Deterrents include lingering bad PR from failed contraceptives  
like the 1970s Dalkon Shield as well as anti-abortion politics. 
Experts also point to lawsuits like those filed by 50,000 users of 
Norplant, six hormone capsules implanted into the arm for five 
years. The suits claim manufacturer Wyeth-Ayerst didn't adequately 
warn about side effects from headaches to ovarian cysts and the 
implanted capsules are hard to remove. Although thousands of 
lawsuits have been dismissed, and the only one yet to reach a jury 
ended in Norplant's favor, sales plummeted during the wrangling. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``the long, long drought'' is easing, said Dr. Michael  
Burnhill of Planned Parenthood, pointing to U.S. studies of 
European-sold contraceptives. ``There is stuff in the pipeline 
now,'' and Americans should have more choices within a few years, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	First, the Today sponge is making a comeback. Although various  
contraceptive sponges sell abroad, Americans have had none since 
Today quit selling in 1995 because its maker broke U.S. 
manufacturing rules. New Jersey's Allendale Pharmaceuticals has 
bought Today from the previous maker and plans to begin selling by 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on the horizon:  
</P>
<P>
	--Unipath Diagnostics Co. has begun U.S. trials of the Persona  
handheld computer, which calculates pregnancy risks depending on 
the day of a woman's menstrual cycle. Studies in Europe suggest 
that with strict use, it's about 94 percent effective. Stewart 
calls it ``a pretty accurate and precise little device'' but warns 
it may require ``an iron will'' because the days women are most 
likely to get pregnant often are when they're most interested in 
sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Unipath recently won U.S. approval for a different computer, the  
ClearPlan Easy, to help women trying to have babies discover their 
most fertile days. It costs about $200. 
</P>
<P>
	--IUDs, which sit in the uterus to block conception, are the  
world's most popular birth control device. But Americans were 
largely scared off by the Dalkon Shield, blamed for painful 
infections, miscarriages and some deaths before it was banned in 
1975. Modern IUDs, including two U.S.-sold versions, have proved 
safe, but scientists hope newer versions sold in Europe, Mirena and 
the Flexi-T, will attract more Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Mirena releases tiny amounts of the hormone levonogestrel onto  
the uterus. Providing five-year contraception, it dramatically 
decreases menstrual blood loss and may reduce life-threatening 
ectopic pregnancies and uterine cancer. Stewart said Europeans 
widely use it in hopes of shrinking fibroids without surgery. The 
New York-based Population Council developed Mirena and licensed it 
to a company that plans to seek U.S. approval this summer, said the 
council's Dr. Elof Johansson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flexi-T, or CS-300 as American scientists call it, was  
created by a German doctor who measured women's uteruses and 
concluded that older IUDs are too big for many, especially those 
who have never given birth. A too-large IUD can cause cramps or 
bleeding. The tinier IUD ``would fit better into the average 
uterus,'' said Dr. Freedolph Anderson of The Jones Institute of the 
Eastern Virginia Medical School. He is hunting 400 more women to 
complete a U.S. study. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Population Council is testing a vaginal ring, a flexible  
plastic ring that steadily emits low levels of hormones. Women 
could slip it in on their own, without the doctor's insertion an 
IUD demands or the critical fit required of a diaphragm, and leave 
it for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	--The FDA in 1996 approved ``Norplant II,'' a two-capsule version  
easier to insert and remove, but Wyeth-Ayerst has yet to market it. 
Meanwhile, Netherlands-based Organon Inc. sells Europeans a 
one-capsule implanted contraceptive called Implanon. Organon 
wouldn't comment, but the Population Council's Johansson said it is 
seeking U.S. sales approval. The council is in final-stage testing 
of its own one-capsule implant. 
</P>
<P>
	The council also is beginning to develop an implant for men that  
would use a chemical to suppress sperm production.

<HEADLINE> Congress May Cut 'Marriage Penalty' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Most Americans have never heard of Vivien  
Kellems. But if they are married and each spouse earns roughly the 
same salary, they should keep her in mind while filling out their 
income tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Kellems, who died in 1975, was a prominent Connecticut  
businesswoman who successfully lobbied Congress in 1969 to change 
the tax code so it would not discriminate against unmarried adults. 
Single people had been at a tax disadvantage to married couples 
since 1948. 
</P>
<P>
	But when one group gains from tinkering with the progressive tax  
code, another loses. Such is the case with the ``marriage penalty'' 
now affecting 21 million couples who pay an average of $1,400 more 
than if they had not tied the knot. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress is weighing at least one proposal to help some married  
couples, hoping to tap the budget surplus to cover the reduced 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Kellems, of East Haddam, Conn., was a manufacturer of cable  
grips who founded War Widows of America with actress Gloria Swanson 
and campaigned against unfair tax treatment for single women. 
</P>
<P>
	She noted millions of women in her generation were unmarried  
because of a post-World War II shortage of potential husbands. 
</P>
<P>
	``What do you do if you can't get a husband? Should you be taxed  
for that?'' she testified before a congressional committee, 
according to ``The Decline (and Fall?) of the Income Tax'' by Yale 
University law professor Michael J. Graetz. 
</P>
<P>
	Decades later, Congress is wrestling with a polar-opposite  
problem: The entry of millions of women into the work force is 
exacerbating the marriage penalty in the tax code. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, the only form one can file to avoid the marriage tax  
penalty is paperwork for divorce,'' said Rep. Jerry Weller, R-Ill., 
sponsor of a bill with 230 co-sponsors aimed at eliminating the 
disparity. 
</P>
<P>
	The penalty is caused by America's progressive tax system, which  
taxes income at different rates based on how much someone earns and 
whether a taxpayer is single or married. 
</P>
<P>
	Without a flat tax rate the same for all taxpayers, it is  
impossible to end all inequities in the code. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government cannot attain marriage neutrality,'' the  
Congressional Budget Office concluded in a recent study. 
</P>
<P>
	Married couples in which both spouses earn roughly similar  
amounts are the most affected by the disparity. In contrast, 
households where one spouse brings home significantly more -- again, 
subject to different tax rates -- gain a marriage ``bonus'' 
averaging about $1,300. 
</P>
<P>
	Graetz argues that this winds up punishing people who decide to  
marry, unless they fit what he calls the ``Ozzie and Harriett'' 
model where one spouse stays home and the other works. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tax law must respond to changes in the economy and the  
society,'' Graetz wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans in Congress have made fixing the marriage penalty  
one of their top tax priorities, and many Democrats also embrace 
the change. 
</P>
<P>
	Budget resolutions passed last month by the House and Senate put  
the penalty at the top of the list for some $800 billion in tax 
cuts the GOP wants over the next decade, using some of the budget 
surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	But whether the change is made this year depends on the outcome  
of the battle between President Clinton and the GOP-led Congress 
over the $1.6 trillion surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	Both say 62 percent of that should be set aside for Social  
Security, but Clinton wants the rest used for Medicare, new 
retirement accounts and more spending instead of the tax relief 
sought by Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Weller's bill -- which counts a dozen Democrats among its  
sponsors -- would get at the marriage penalty two ways: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Increase the 15 percent income tax bracket for married couples  
from $41,200 to $49,300 -- or twice the $24,650 bracket for single 
people. That would give married couples an additional $8,100 
subject to the lower 15 percent rate instead of the 28 percent 
rate. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Increase the standard deduction for married couples from  
$6,900 to $8,300, again twice the amount now enjoyed by singles. 
</P>
<P>
	The change would cost the government an estimated $144 billion  
over five years. It also would continue one tax inequality by 
increasing the ``bonus'' paid to married couples with one main 
breadwinner. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservative pro-family groups ranging from the Christian  
Coalition to the Family Research Council are supporting Weller's 
bill. A joint letter from nine such groups to House Speaker Dennis 
Hastert, R-Ill., said the change would ``recognize and support'' 
the institution of marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Couples who marry should not be penalized as they make the  
daily commitments and sacrifices necessary to support their 
families,'' the letter says.

	UN Ends Sanctions Against Libya  
</P>
<P>
	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- The United Nations today suspended  
sanctions against Libya after the African nation handed over two 
suspects in the deadly bombing of a jetliner over Scotland. The 
sanctions prevented air travel to and from Libya, and isolated it 
from the West for the past seven years. Former Libyan intelligence 
agents Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah are 
accused of planting a suitcase bomb that blew up Pan Am Flight 103 
on Dec. 21, 1988, killing 270 people. They will be tried under 
Scottish law.

	Clinton Reiterates Kosovo Stance  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Expressing U.S. determination in the campaign  
against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, President Clinton 
today reaffirmed his commitment to assist Kosovo refugees and vowed 
to ``persist until we prevail.'' Clinton also said that clearing 
weather in the Balkans was enabling NATO forces to target Serb 
forces moving through Kosovo and dismissed criticism that his 
administration didn't heed military concerns about the likely 
success of using airstrikes to stop Milosevic. The ethnic cleansing 
in the Balkans called for action, Clinton said. 

</P>
<P>
	Cohen Warns Yugoslavia of Attacks  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen says  
Serb military and police forces are ``open and vulnerable'' to 
stepped-up NATO air assaults. Cohen warned the Serbs that NATO 
attacks against Yugoslavia will be greatly expanded in the coming 
days. ``We're going after his tanks, his armored units, his 
artillery, those forces on the ground that are carrying out this 
horrific ethnic cleansing. They are going to be targeted now and 
taken out,'' Cohen said.

	Suspect in Gay Attack Pleads Guilty  
</P>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- A man pleaded guilty today in the slaying  
of gay college student Matthew Shepard, cutting short a trial that 
could have ended with the death penalty. Russell Henderson, 21, a 
high school dropout and roofer, pleaded guilty to felony murder, 
with robbery as the related crime, and kidnapping. He could get two 
life sentences, one on each count. Henderson had been charged with 
first-degree murder, kidnapping and aggravated robbery in the 
beating death of Shepard.

	Defendants Have Right to Silence  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Criminal defendants who plead guilty have a  
constitutional right to remain silent at sentencing without judges 
holding it against them, the Supreme Court ruled today. The 
justices said judges cannot impose harsher punishment if such 
defendants refuse to give details about the crime. The ruling would 
stop prosecutors from indicting someone in a drug case without 
specifying the amount of drugs involved, obtain a guilty plea and 
then use the defendant's testimony at sentencing to establish the 
amount of drugs.

	Ex-Whitewater Prosecutor Testifies  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A prosecutor was called as a witness  
today at the trial of Whitewater figure Susan McDougal. Ray Jahn 
helped convict Mrs. McDougal on fraud charges in 1996. Jahn said he 
didn't want to hurt President Clinton during Mrs. McDougal's trial, 
and in fact hoped to exonerate Clinton. Jahn said as a Democrat, he 
didn't want a criminal probe of the president. Mrs. McDougal says 
Jahn pressured her to give perjured testimony that falsely 
implicated the Clintons in wrongdoing. McDougal is on trial for 
contempt and obstruction, for refusing to answer questions before a 
grand jury.

	Egg Hunt Held at White House

hard-boiled eggs along the lawn to a finish line. For their effort, 
they got a plastic egg filled with candy and other gifts. Prior to

interim head coach. The Wizards are 4 1/2 games out of a playoff spot. 
Bickerstaff was in his 10th season as an NBA coach. His record was

<HEADLINE> Court Won't Revive Waco Libel Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today refused to revive a  
Waco television reporter's libel lawsuit over coverage of a federal 
raid on the Branch Davidian compound in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices, without comment, let stand a Texas Supreme Court  
ruling that threw out John McLemore's lawsuit against Dallas-Forth 
Worth station WFAA-TV. The lawsuit accused the station of airing 
reports implying McLemore had tipped the religious sect about the 
raid. 
</P>
<P>
	The Feb. 28, 1993, confrontation led to a 51-day standoff that  
ended when the compound was consumed by fire, killing Branch 
Davidian leader David Koresh and more than 80 followers. 
</P>
<P>
	McLemore, then a reporter for KWTX-TV, was on the scene when the  
raid erupted in gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
	A Treasury Department investigation cleared McLemore of any  
misconduct. The report said the Davidians were alerted by a postal 
driver, who had been told by a Waco TV photographer that a raid was 
imminent. The photographer said he had not known the postal worker 
was a Koresh follower. 
</P>
<P>
	McLemore sued various news organizations and individuals in  
1994. All the defendants except WFAA were dropped or dismissed from 
the case before it reached the Texas Supreme Court last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The state court ruled that McLemore's coverage of the raid had  
made him a public figure, requiring that he prove the allegedly 
libelous comments about him were made with ``actual malice'' -- with 
knowledge or reckless disregard of falsity. 
</P>
<P>
	Had the court ruled that McLemore was not a public figure, he  
would have to prove only falsity and negligence, an easier legal 
standard to meet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas court ruled that WFAA showed the sued-over reports  
were based sufficient reporting and with the good-faith belief they 
were true. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, McLemore's lawyer argued that he  
never should have been deemed a public figure. 
</P>
<P>
	``A public figure must not only act voluntarily when he enters  
into a public controversy, he must intend to influence its 
outcome,'' the appeal said. ``McLemore may have entered into the 
Branch Davidian raid voluntarily but nothing he said and nothing he 
did had anything to do with the public issues surrounding the 
raid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It added: ``He has not thrust himself into the forefront of a  
public controversy, and he is not a public figure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case is McLemore vs. WFAA-TV, 98-1286.

<HEADLINE> Conn. Serial Killer To Go on Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) -- Twelve years after receiving six death  
sentences, serial killer Michael Ross is going on trial -- again. 
</P>
<P>
	Ross, an articulate Ivy League graduate who has been compared to  
murderer Ted Bundy, has admitted killing eight women, six of them 
in Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, jury selection begins in the penalty phase of a trial  
that began in 1987 but has followed a circuitous route through the 
legal system with various appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge Thomas Miano has vowed to finally bring the  
case to a conclusion, which would mean either the death penalty or 
life in prison for Ross. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury selection starts Tuesday and is expected to take six to  
eight weeks. The trial itself could last two months or longer. 
</P>
<P>
	The case has gone on so long that some witnesses are no longer  
alive, including Roger Baribeault, the father of one of the 
victims. The original prosecutor, C. Robert Satti, is retired and 
may now become a witness. State's Attorney Kevin Kane has had to 
take over the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	Kane's job will be to resurrect a case from what has been left  
behind. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those expected to testify is Michael W. Malchik, a former  
detective with the state police major crime squad who broke the 
case in June 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did I ever expect to be trying the case again 15 years later?  
No,'' Malchik said recently. ``The difficulty is that you basically 
have to try the whole case over again. When it was tried the first 
time, it was before the same jury. We had to put on just a few 
weeks of additional evidence. The jury understood all the facts and 
the guilt. Now, in a way, we have to put on a whole new trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ross' guilt is not in question. He confessed, and on June 5,  
1987, a jury found him guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cornell University graduate captured his victims as they  
walked along quiet, deserted roads, prosecutors said. He raped most 
of them, then flipped them over onto their stomachs and strangled 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1982, 17-year-old Tammy Williams of New York City and Debra  
Smith Taylor, 23, of Griswold were killed. Robyn Stavinsky, 19, of 
Norwich was murdered in 1983. The following year, Wendy Baribeault, 
17, of Jewett City, and two 14-year-old friends, Leslie Shelley and 
April Brunais, both of Griswold, died. 
</P>
<P>
	Ross, who is now 39, also admits to killing two New York women  
and raping a woman in North Carolina, though he has never been 
prosecuted for those crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was convicted in 1987, he received six death sentences  
and two life sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	In July 1994, the state Supreme Court upheld Ross' Connecticut  
convictions but overturned the death sentences. Finding that the 
original trial judge excluded evidence that might have helped Ross 
prove he suffered from a mental illness or defect, the court 
ordered a new penalty phase. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the state law that was in effect at the time of his  
conviction, Ross would be spared the death penalty if the jury 
finds a mitigating factor, like mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Kane will try to prove aggravating factors, in this case that  
the crimes were committed in a ``cruel and heinous'' manner. 
</P>
<P>
	But picking a jury may prove difficult because of the case's  
notoriety. ``I don't think people have forgotten this case in New 
London County,'' Malchik said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last August, Judge Miano issued a gag order on the attorneys in  
the case; both Kane and Public Defender Barry Butler declined to 
comment. Family members of the victims, some of whom are expected 
to testify, also declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Trudy Gregorie, director of victims services at the National  
Center for Victims of Crime in Arlington, Va., said any family in 
their situation would be dreading what lies ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time there is a new development in the case, it brings  
them back to the moment when they found that their loved one had 
been murdered, even if it's 15 years later,'' Gregorie said. ``They 
can never really find any peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ann Cole, a longtime friend of Ross, said Ross, too, is dreading  
the trial. In November, he attempted suicide in his prison cell by 
overdosing on medication. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes he just wishes he would go to sleep and not wake  
up,'' Cole said. ``I'm very concerned that he could have a complete 
nervous breakdown during the trial.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Reporter Reveals Chiquita Source </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- A newspaper reporter who admitted intercepting  
voice mail from Chiquita testified Monday that a former attorney 
for the banana company was a confidential source for his stories. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Gallagher was the lead reporter for The Cincinnati  
Enquirer's series in May 1998 that questioned Chiquita's business 
practices in Central America. The newspaper later renounced the 
series, fired Gallagher, apologized to Chiquita Brands 
International on the front page and paid the Cincinnati-based 
company more than $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In September, Gallagher pleaded guilty to illegally intercepting  
communications and obtaining unauthorized access to Chiquita's 
computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
	He never testified about how he obtained the voice mail  
messages, but agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. On Monday, he 
was called to testify by attorneys representing George Ventura, a 
Salt Lake City lawyer who formerly worked for Chiquita. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura goes on trial April 19 on charges that he helped steal  
the voice mail messages. Attorneys were in court Monday to argue 
about evidence to be allowed in that trial, and whether charges of 
illegal interception of communication should be dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	Under questioning from Ventura's attorney Marc Mezibov,  
Gallagher said Ventura was one of about six people he promised 
confidentiality in return for their help on the Chiquita series. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallagher, 40, could be sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison, but his  
plea bargain notes that there is no mandatory prison term. His 
sentencing was delayed until May 13, after he testifies at 
Ventura's trial.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices rose today in quiet trading.  
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was up 1/8 point,  
or $1.25 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield was unchanged from 
Friday's half-day session at 5.59 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices of short-term and intermediate Treasury securities were  
unchanged, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information

</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.38 percent as the  
discount fell 0.03 percentage point to 4.27 percent. Six-month 
yields were 4.51 percent, as the discount rose 0.02 percentage 
point to 4.35 percent. One-year yields were 4.65 percent as the 
discount was unchanged from late Friday at 4.43 percent.

<HEADLINE> Profits for Fortune 500 Firms Dip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Internet companies may dominate the news these  
days, but they have a ways to go to be a factor in the Fortune 500. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortune magazine's annual ranking of publicly traded U.S.  
companies according to revenue was topped for the 11th straight 
year by General Motors, which took in $161.3 billion in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the Internet companies, America Online came closest to  
making the list, coming in at No. 535 with $2.6 billion in revenue. 
The company that ranked No. 500, container maker Ball Corp., had 
nearly $2.9 billion in revenue, according to the list released 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	While the stock prices of Internet darlings such as auctioneer  
eBay and retailer Amazon.com have given them market capitalizations 
surpassing many Fortune 500 firms, they have yet to generate 
significant revenues, let alone profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Fortune said 1998 would likely mark the beginning of the  
end of the dominance of blue chips such as General Motors and 
Coca-Cola. Younger high-tech companies such as Microsoft, Cisco 
Systems and Dell, with their surging revenues, are wielding more 
influence in corporate America. 
</P>
<P>
	``(1998) will probably be considered a watershed year, the year  
when the New Economy fundamentally parted ways with the old and 
high-tech consolidated its role as the driving force behind the 
growth of big business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cisco jumped 61 slots from No. 253 to 192, while Dell Computer  
shot up from No. 125 to 78. Microsoft, which is the top U.S. 
company in terms of market value, is ranked 109, up from 137 last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, profits at the Fortune 500 companies declined for the  
first time in seven years in 1998 as U.S. companies suffered the 
effects of the economic crisis in Asia, Russia and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	Profits fell 1.8 percent last year, compared to 7.8 percent  
earnings growth in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue growth shrank to 4 percent from 8.7 percent in 1997 as  
U.S. companies found demand for their products and services stifled 
by the ongoing financial problems overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	GM is followed by Ford with $144.4 billion, Wal-Mart with $139.2  
billion, Exxon with $101.7 billion and General Electric with $100.5 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM was sixth with $81.7 billion, followed by Citigroup with  
$76.4 billion, Philip Morris with $57.8 billion, Boeing with $56.1 
billion and AT&AMP;T with $53.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Chrysler, a perennial top-10 finisher, disappeared from the list  
as its merger with Daimler-Benz, made it a foreign company and 
therefore ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
	Several other megamergers shook up the rankings, with no less  
than 33 of the 47 new arrivals reaching the list by way of a 
merger, the magazine said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the largest deals were the Citibank-Travelers Group  
combination that propelled Citigroup into the No. 7 slot from 
Citibank's 1997 rank of 21 and the merger with MCI that sent 
WorldCom from No. 210 to No. 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-seven companies were bumped from the list. Two of the most  
notable were Reader's Digest, which fell from No. 490 to 529, and 
Borden, which slipped from 414 to 585. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest employer among the 500 was Wal-Mart with 910,000  
workers, followed by GM with 594,000.

<HEADLINE> Coast Guard Urges Fishing Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Responding to four accidents that killed 11 clam  
fishermen, the Coast Guard is recommending sweeping safety 
proposals, including licenses for skippers and mandatory boat 
inspections. 
</P>
<P>
	The December and January deaths of the East Coast clam fishermen  
signal ``the time is right'' to greatly increase safety 
precautions, Rear Admiral R.C. North wrote in an attachment to a 
task force report released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The report concludes most commercial fishing fatalities --  
including the recent deaths -- are preventable. 
</P>
<P>
	Poor compliance with already inadequate safety standards -- along  
with low use of voluntary safety measures such as boat inspections 
-- often lead to dangerous conditions on the boats, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Operator licenses, crew competency certificates and mandatory  
inspections are among the task force's recommendations. All would 
require congressional approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress has declined to pass the licensing requirements three  
times before. Some lawmakers have said the commercial fishing 
industry is already highly regulated. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can try to make it better,'' said William Adler, a  
lobsterman. ``But you can also make it such a nightmare that these 
fishermen just can't operate.''

<HEADLINE> Indians Already Sell Out Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Cleveland Indians go into the 1999 season  
with a hefty payroll but also financially secure with a bankroll 
from a sold out home schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Since moving to Jacobs Field in 1994, the Indians have never had  
a losing record, and they've been to the World Series twice. The 
Indians have sold out their last 292 home games. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland opens its season Tuesday night at Anaheim. The home  
opener is scheduled for Monday against Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians announced last week that all Jacobs Field tickets  
for the 1999 season, about 3.5 million, have been sold at an 
average ticket price of $19.37. That assures a guaranteed revenue 
source of about $67 million. Ticket sales last year provided about 
38 percent of total revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland will open the season with a payroll of about $69  
million, among the top six in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``We try to budget so as to ensure a profit for just the regular  
season,'' Ron McQuate, Indians director of corporate planning and 
development, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Real estate developer Richard E. Jacobs maintains control of the  
team, largely through his privately held shares in an unusual 
public-private partnership. Cleveland Indians Baseball Co., the 
public portion of the team, sold 4 million shares in its initial 
offering last June. The stock was sold initially at $15 a share, 
but has been selling recently on the NASDAQ market at about $8.50. 
</P>
<P>
	From June, when the public structure of the team took effect,  
through the end of last year, the team produced a profit of nearly 
$7.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But last year leading up to June, the Indians operated at a loss  
of $9.7 million, according to disclosure document filed last week 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Combining the two periods, the 1998 net loss of about $2.5  
million contrasts with a $22.6 million profit in 1997. But it 
wasn't really a loss, McQuate says. 
</P>
<P>
	About $11.5 million subtracted from the public side of the  
ledger was actually the profit paid to Jacobs' private portion of 
the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	McQuate said several unusual factors explain why last year was  
not as profitable as 1997. The Indians in 1997 accounted for 
receiving $9.2 million in expansion fees from the Arizona 
Diamondbacks and Tampa Bay Devil Rays. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians were involved in 18 postseason games in 1997, when  
they advanced to the seventh game of the World Series. They were in 
10 postseason games in 1998. As a result, revenue from postseason 
games was about $4.3 million less last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The team also saw a $2 million drop in merchandise sales,  
largely the result of the lack of a World Series appearance, 
McQuate said.

<HEADLINE> Wind Delays Launch of Rocket </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Boeing called off the launch of its  
new Delta III rocket tonight because the wind was blowing inland. 
</P>
<P>
	Launch controllers feared that in the event of an accident,  
clouds of toxic rocket fuel and chunks of rocket might endanger 
populated areas. They said they would try again Tuesday. 
</P>

	The inaugural launch of the Delta III, last August, ended in a  
fireball 70 seconds into the flight. The rocket tilted, broke apart 
and exploded over the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing officials said they have changed the computer program for  
the Delta III's flight control and double-checked all systems. The 
rocket holds a communication satellite intended to serve Asia and 
the Pacific region.

<HEADLINE> Nevada Executes Double Murderer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) -- Authorities rejected pleas by the  
Philippine government Monday and executed a Filipino man convicted 
of killing two U-Haul employees with a hammer and crowbar during a 
1994 robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	Alvaro Calambro, 25, died by injection. His last words,  
according to Prisons Director Bob Bayer, were: ``I regret it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calambro had refused to file his own appeal. Philippine  
officials argued that the execution would violate the Vienna 
Convention treaty because they weren't immediately notified of 
Calambro's arrest in 1994, leaving him with inadequate legal 
representation. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Frankie Sue Del Papa said the U.S. Supreme  
Court has made clear that a foreign national imprisoned in the 
United States must raise alleged treaty violations in a timely 
manner, and that didn't happen in Calambro's case. 
</P>
<P>
	Calambro and Duc Huynh were convicted of killing Peggy Crawford  
and Keith Christopher during a $2,400 robbery at the U-Haul 
business. Both were beaten to death with a tire iron and hammer. 
</P>
<P>
	Huynh also got a death sentence, but hanged himself at Ely State  
Prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight men have been executed in Nevada since the death penalty  
was reinstated in 1977. One woman and 83 men remain on Nevada's 
death row.

<HEADLINE> Davis Cup Is a Tough Sell in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Even with his big victory, Jim Courier knew it was  
not enough. The Davis Cup does not stir the passions of American 
sports fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's too much competition in America, sportswise,  
for that realistically to change in the near future,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Courier's two singles victories carried the United States to a  
3-2 decision over Britain in the first round. His match Sunday was 
the clincher, a 6-4, 6-7 (3-7), 6-3, 1-6, 8-6 decision over Greg 
Rusedski in Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
	The American victory came on the same day the baseball season  
opened. The NHL was moving toward the playoffs and the NBA was in 
the thick of its schedule. The Masters was waiting in the wings. 
</P>
<P>
	But even in ideal conditions, the Davis Cup is a tough sell in  
the United States. And not only with fans. Two of its best players, 
Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi, took a pass on the U.S.-Britain 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Henman, who with Rusedski formed a two-man British team,  
can't understand why Sampras no longer plays Davis Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's great to be a part of it, but at the end of the  
day it's his decision,'' Henman said. ``If he doesn't want to be 
part of it, if anything, it's his loss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henman, who practices with Sampras and has teamed with him in  
doubles, says the Davis Cup matched playing Wimbledon, an event 
Sampras has won five times. 
</P>
<P>
	Courier's singles partner, Todd Martin, in the wake of what The  
Daily Telegraph called the ``most memorable Davis Cup tie in 
Britain since the war,'' said he sympathized with calls to modify 
the Davis Cup. One suggestion is to play every two years instead of 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are still flaws,'' Martin said. ``After this there's  
three months ... before the next tie, and that's a flaw.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But I don't see how this can't excite people about tennis,  
especially about the Davis Cup,'' he added 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. captain Tom Gullikson, who must constantly lobby the top  
players for the Davis Cup, said Courier and Martin would play in 
the quarterfinals in July in Boston against Australia -- even if 
Sampras and Andre Agassi come aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys have the first option, absolutely,'' Gullikson  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	And, like Martin, Gullikson admits the Davis Cup needs help.  
</P>
<P>
	``On the ATP Tour they could advertise that they (players) play  
Davis Cup for their country,'' he added. ``They sometimes spout off 
tour records. This should be a part of the introduction at 
tournaments. You want to promote the fact that they play for their 
country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, with a record 31 Davis Cup victories and  
28 times a runner-up, the event has lost its glow. Not so in 
Britain, which hasn't won the cup since 1936 and is back in the 
World Group (the Davis Cup elite 16) for the first time since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	This may have been a defeat, but the British media played it  
with banner headlines, full-page photos, some page one news 
treatment and blanket television coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Britain's aces beaten but not defeated,'' The Times said on  
its front page, sharing space with two stories on NATO air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Britain's cup of tears,'' said a headline topping Monday's The  
Daily Telegraph sports section. 
</P>
<P>
	``Britain broken on the Rock,'' The Guardian said in reference  
to Courier. 
</P>
<P>
	The London tabloids were rougher.  
</P>
<P>
	``What a Choker,'' said The Mirror alongside a photo of a  
dejected Rusedski. ``Choked to Brits,'' said the rival The Sun. 
</P>
<P>
	Montreal-born Rusedski, who took British citizenship four years  
ago and has been criticized for not sounding and acting British 
enough, accepted the blame. 
</P>
<P>
	``I basically let the team down by not winning one singles  
match,'' said Rusedski, who used the very English game of lawn 
bowling, similar to the Italian game boccie, to explain his 
feelings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to be close,'' he said. ``But only bowls, not in  
tennis.''

<HEADLINE> Man Who Spread AIDS Virus Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAYVILLE, N.Y. (AP) -- A man accused of infecting least 13 young  
women with the AIDS virus through unprotected sex was sentenced 
Monday to four to 12 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Nushawn Williams, 22, struck a plea bargain after only two  
victims agreed to testify. Some of the other women never came 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said Williams traded drugs for sex with young  
women and teens he approached in schools and parks. 
</P>
<P>
	The case spread fear across rural western New York when it  
became public in October 1997. State confidentiality laws prevent 
people who are HIV positive from being identified. But prosecutors 
persuaded a judge to disclose Williams' identity and allow for his 
photo to be distributed. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who is already serving a prison sentence for selling  
crack, pleaded guilty to statutory rape for having sex with a 
13-year-old girl. He also pleaded guilty to reckless endangerment 
for having unprotected sex with another teen-ager. She later 
contracted the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams claimed he didn't believe the public health nurse who  
told him he was HIV-positive, so he continued having unprotected 
sex. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not an evil person,'' defense attorney Richard Slater  
said. ``He's been painted as an evil person. He feels badly that 
he's ill. He expressed to me the concern he may not live out his 
sentence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams pleaded guilty to a similar reckless endangerment  
charge involving a 15-year-old girl in New York City and is 
awaiting sentencing.

<HEADLINE> Cancer Drug May Fight Heart Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- An experimental drug that has shown promise  
against cancer also appears to have the potential to prevent heart 
disease -- the top killer in much of the industrialized world, 
researchers reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug, endostatin, caused a sensation last year when the same  
Harvard team said it could wipe out cancer in lab mice by choking 
off the blood supply in tumors. 
</P>
<P>
	In today's issue of the American Heart Association journal  
Circulation, researchers presented evidence that endostatin may 
also greatly slow the development of atherosclerosis, a hardening 
of the arteries through the buildup of fatty deposits. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug has not yet been tested on people. But the research  
raises the possibility that a new category of drugs -- blood vessel 
inhibitors -- may be useful against both heart disease and cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Heart disease, like cancer, involves unwanted tissue growth --  
the accumulation of cholesterol, blood cells and smooth muscle 
cells in lumps known as plaque. Plaque growing in the heart 
arteries is the chief cause of heart attacks and angina pain. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts have long noticed that plaque often has its own network  
of tiny blood vessels called capillaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``By blocking them, perhaps we can alter the progression of the  
disease,'' said Dr. Karen Moulton, who conducted the current study 
in the lab of Dr. Judah Folkman, the Harvard Medical School 
researcher who pioneered the study of angiogenesis, the growth of 
new blood vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	Endostatin is a natural protein that blocks blood vessel  
formation. Without blood, cancer in lab animals often stops growing 
and disappears. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 16-week experiment involving 73 mice, researchers tested  
endostatin on animals that were fed a high-cholesterol diet. They 
found that those on the drug averaged 85 percent less plaque 
buildup in their hearts' aortas than untreated animals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very exciting concept,'' said Dr. Stephen Epstein of  
Washington Hospital Center in Washington. ``If the data can be 
validated by other labs, it represents a whole new paradigm for 
strategies to prevent atherosclerosis and its complications.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Epstein acknowledged that the discovery also presents  
``a very important conundrum,'' because drugs that promote blood 
vessel growth, rather than block it, are already one of the hottest 
areas of heart disease research. 
</P>
<P>
	Epstein and others are testing the use of growth proteins that  
trigger the body to sprout new blood vessels. When injected into 
the heart, these proteins induce the growth of a new blood supply. 
This nourishes heart muscle that is starved by clogged arteries. 
</P>
<P>
	Some human testing suggests this treatment can relieve the  
effects of badly blocked arteries. But Epstein said the latest work 
raises the possibility that it could also make the underlying 
disease worse by promoting the growth of plaque. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Dr. Jeffrey Isner of St. Elizabeth's Medical Center in  
Boston said his own animal experiments show no evidence that 
stimulating the growth of blood vessels will speed up 
atherosclerosis or do anything else bad. 
</P>
<P>
	Moulton speculated that both treatments could eventually find a  
place in controlling heart disease. Blood vessel inhibitors like 
endostatin might be given at a relatively early stage of disease, 
just as cholesterol-lowering statins are now used to keep blood 
vessels healthy. The blood vessel stimulators would be reserved for 
relieving arteries that are already badly clogged. 
</P>
<P>
	At EntreMed Inc. in Rockville, Md., which is developing  
endostatin, spokeswoman Mary Sundeed said the company is 
concentrating on the cancer uses of the drug and has no plans to 
test it against heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
	She said initial safety testing of endostatin in cancer patients  
should begin this summer at the University of Wisconsin and M.D. 
Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.

<HEADLINE> What's the News in Washington? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The coded first message sent pulsing over the  
wire from the U.S. Capitol to Baltimore could once be quoted by 
every school child: ``What hath God wrought?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reply, bounding across the 35 miles of wooden poles and  
metal wires, seemed far more practical and to the point. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's the news in Washington?'' it asked.  
</P>
<P>
	Operators in a room at the U.S. Capitol and at a railroad depot  
on Pratt Street in Baltimore soon began providing answers -- at 
least to the second question: News from Congress went out and news 
from Baltimore, which was host to the 1844 Democratic National 
Convention, came back. 
</P>
<P>
	When Samuel Finley Breese Morse opened the wire between the  
Capitol and Baltimore on May 24, 1844, he already knew he had 
successfully harnessed a force of nature, a development 
foreshadowed by Benjamin Franklin's experiments with electricity in 
the 18th century. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, Morse, then 53, knew that after a dozen years of  
experiments he could, in fact, transmit messages over long 
distances, leapfrogging both space and time. 
</P>
<P>
	The challenge was to prove to the public and to Congress, which  
had paid $30,000 to build the line to Baltimore, that the Morse 
magnetic telegraph had practical applications. 
</P>
<P>
	That became clear almost immediately.  
</P>
<P>
	Among the first messages received in Washington was news that  
the Democrats had nominated Sen. Silas Wright of New York for 
second place on the fall ticket with dark horse James Knox Polk. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright was in the Capitol. He declined the vice presidency by  
telegraph. 
</P>
<P>
	But could the system be trusted? Could the odd little device be  
telling the truth? 
</P>
<P>
	In Baltimore, the convention's presiding officer reported that  
delegates so much doubted the validity of Wright's electronic 
refusal that they adjourned for a day to await ``reliable'' 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	A committee, sent by rail from Baltimore, reported that Wright  
had indeed refused to be nominated as vice president. George 
Mifflin Dallas later was nominated, and he and Polk went on to win 
the vice presidency and presidency, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	``The exchange demonstrated the telegraph's validity ... As the  
news came over the wire, Morse gathered up messages and posted them 
in the Capitol Rotunda ...,'' said Donald A. Ritchie, the associate 
historian of the Senate, in ``Press Gallery,'' a 1991 history of 
``Congress and the Washington Correspondents'' published by Harvard 
University Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Most people knew an important bridge had been crossed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Information will be literally winged with the rapidity of  
lightning,'' the Baltimore weekly, Niles National Register, 
reported on June 22. ``Both space and time is annihilated ....'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Morse, Congress proved more difficult to move than electric  
pulses. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, the proposal that Congress pay to demonstrate the new  
technology nearly drowned in ridicule. 
</P>
<P>
	The lowest moment came when the House failed by only six votes  
to approve an amendment that would have diverted half the money to 
a study of the message-sending potential of hypnotism. 
</P>
<P>
	There was less difficulty in the Senate, but as its session  
neared an end, the telegraph bill appeared hopelessly buried and 
its late-night resurrection a near-miracle. 
</P>
<P>
	``My personal funds were reduced to the fraction of a dollar,  
and had the ... bill failed from any cause, there would have been 
little prospect of another attempt on my part to introduce my new 
invention to the world,'' Morse wrote a friend. 
</P>
<P>
	But even when the demonstration proved an unqualified success,  
the government declined to buy Morse's patents or to sponsor a 
national telegraph system. Officials refused to believe the system 
could ever pay for itself. 
</P>
<P>
	In private hands, the telegraph proved to be a technological  
milestone, the forerunner of the telephone, radio, television and 
eventually the Internet. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Riot Police Patrol Israeli Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAZARETH, Israel (AP) -- Riot police patrolled the town of Jesus'  
boyhood after clashes erupted between Christians and Muslims over a 
planned millennium pilgrimage site on a spot where Muslims want to 
build a mosque. 
</P>
<P>
	The violence marred Easter Sunday celebrations in Nazareth, a  
city of 60,000 in northern Israel that has long prided itself on 
its tolerance but has seen growing tensions between the Muslim 
majority and the Christian minority in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sunday's clashes, seven people were injured, 30 cars were  
damaged and six Muslim stone-throwers were arrested, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	``My house was attacked with stones today,'' said Salim Suliman,  
a 68-year-old Christian shopkeeper. ``I never imagined that this 
would happen. We always lived in tolerance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, thousands of young Muslim men gathered at the  
disputed downtown site near the Church of the Annunciation where 
the Christian mayor wants to build a plaza for millennium pilgrims. 
</P>
<P>
	Muslims say the land belongs to the Islamic Trust, or waqf, and  
demand that a mosque be built there. Last year, Muslim activists 
set up a protest tent where they have been holding daily prayers. 
</P>
<P>
	During the confrontations, some Muslims hurled insults and  
curses at Christian worshippers leaving the church where Roman 
Catholic tradition holds that the Angel Gabriel appeared before 
Mary and told her she was pregnant. Other youths, wielding clubs, 
smashed windshields of cars with crosses dangling from the mirrors. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of Israeli riot police were deployed to end the fighting  
but made little effort to halt the violence. At one point, 
policemen stood and watched as Muslim youths smashed the window of 
a Mercedes. Police said Muslim protesters responded to the arrests 
by pelting troops with stones outside the mosque. Israeli forces 
then fired tears gas, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Overnight, police patrolled the streets of Nazareth to prevent a  
renewed outbreak of violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Muslim activists want to build a mosque and Islamic studies  
center on the spot where city planners had hoped to build a 
Venetian-style plaza for tourists. The dispute is in court, and the 
plaza construction is on hold. 
</P>
<P>
	Rafieh Shihaberi, a 53-year-old Muslim engineer from Nazareth,  
said the religious tensions are destructive but the mosque must be 
expanded. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is happening in Nazareth is not in the interest of either  
Muslims or Christians,'' Shihaberi said.

<HEADLINE> Duval Takes Day Off from Golf  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- Too bad Monday was only a practice round at  
the Masters. David Duval took the day off. 
</P>
<P>
	While most everyone else was getting a look at the new rough and  
the two new tee boxes at Augusta National, Duval arrived at the 
clubhouse with little fanfare, seated backward in the back of a 
golf cart. That seemed only appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	During the first three months of the season, Duval has left  
everyone in his wake. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish he would play a little less, so maybe I might win  
one,'' Justin Leonard said. ``What he's done is incredible. If 
there was somebody whose respect he didn't have before this year, I 
think he's gained it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval's latest conquest was Sunday in the BellSouth Classic,  
where he went from two strokes down to a two-stroke victory over 
the last four holes in which the full measure of his game was on 
display -- brilliant chipping, solid putting, long drives and 
remarkable calm. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's definitely got something going on in his head that most  
people don't have,'' said Mark Calcavecchia. ``That could be the 
peaceful feeling he's talking about, the thing where you hit it, 
find it and hit it again. He knows he's good enough that he can 
keep plugging away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was his fourth victory this year, and second time he had won  
back-to-back. No one else has won more than once this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Calcavecchia watched it all unfold on the television in  
Augusta's clubhouse, where he stopped for lunch before playing nine 
holes in fading sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is he going to win every tournament?'' Calcavecchia said.  
``Four wins in the '90s is good, let alone four wins in 3 1/2 months. 
That's unbelievable. He's got to be the man to beat. I can't 
imagine he's going to suffer any kind of letdown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That proved to be a popular sentiment on Monday. The Duval  
Express was as hot a topic Monday as the crew-cut rough that frames 
the fairways and the 17th tee box that has been moved back 25 
yards, finally making the best players in the world realize why 
President Eisenhower wanted to chop down the pine tree that looms 
over the left side of the fairway. 
</P>
<P>
	Winning four tournaments in a year is heady stuff. Since 1980,  
only Nick Price in 1994 has won more often in a full season. Duval 
still has about 16 events left this year, including the four 
majors. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been hotter than a firecracker,'' said Fuzzy Zoeller.  
``He has a lot of talent, and it was just a matter of time before 
it started happening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With his victory in The Players Championship two weeks ago,  
Duval rose to No. 1 in the world ranking, ending Tiger Woods' reign 
at 41 weeks. He still lacks a major championship, and being the 
heavy favorite at Augusta doesn't always guarantee a green jacket. 
</P>
<P>
	The last player who came to the Masters on this kind of a roll  
and managed to win was Fred Couples in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``He hasn't won a major yet,'' Couples said. ``But he's won 11  
of the last 34 times he's played. That's borderline ridiculous. I 
don't know of anyone else who's done that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last player to put together such a stretch was Tom Watson in  
1980. To find someone who has already won four times going into the 
Masters, go all the way back to the Johnny Miller in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	``Has he really won four already?'' Jim Furyk asked. ``I don't  
think anyone is surprised because David has been playing well and 
he really doesn't have any weaknesses. Then again, it's 
incredible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller finished in a tie for 15th in the Masters that year, but  
he bagged his four victories before he even got to the Florida 
swing. Duval comes into the Masters riding the confidence of having 
won the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think my head is where it needs to be,'' Duval said. ``I  
think my golf swing is where it needs to be. It is in a good spot 
right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All he needs now is rest, which is why he didn't even bother to  
bring his clubs down Magnolia Lane when he registered. Duval always 
takes Monday off, and there's no reason to change that this week. 
</P>
<P>
	More than anything, Duval attributes his success this year to  
his frame of mind. He won in Hawaii, took a week off to go 
snowboarding in Idaho, then came back and shot a 59 on Sunday to 
win the Hope Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	He took off three weeks in March, showed up at The Players  
Championship and won the biggest tournament of his career to date, 
then moved on to Atlanta for another victory speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you make sure you're rested when you're playing, and that  
you are ready to play and you're looking forward to playing, I have 
found that to be the most important thing for me to play well,'' he 
said. ``I need to be in a position where I want to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is in that position now -- at the top of his game, in the most  
important arena in golf, facing a field that is not about to hand 
him a green jacket without a fight.
