If this were one of those Mafia films Americans like so much, we'd
have reached the point where Don Corleone pulls us aside and
whispers in our ear in Italian, ``No fare lo stupido.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't be stupid.
</P>
<P>
   The saga of Salvatore ``Sammy the Bull'' Gravano, currently
playing on TV sets throughout Arizona and the United States should
not be confused with The Godfather, Goodfellas or Casino. It's not
an episode of The Sopranos, for which the actual hit man Gravano
was invited to appear on the show as a make-believe hit man.
</P>
<P>
   I understand how some of you may be confused.
</P>
<P>
   Just remember, after filming the scene from The Godfather in
which Luca Brasi is choked to death with piano wire, the actor
being strangled, Lenny ``Bull'' Montana, simply rose from the floor
and went on to play variations of the same character in numerous
movies and television shows.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, not one of the 19 murder victims linked to
Gravano ever made another living appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, after Gravano turned state's evidence and helped
convict John Gotti and 36 other New York mobsters, our federal
government cut him a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Uncle Sam, Sammy the Bull spent less then five years
in prison, after which he was set up with a new identity, a new
house and a new business. And, if local authorities are correct,
this was of enormous assistance to Gravano when he decided to start
selling designer drugs to Arizona kids.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Gravano's criminal syndicate targeted ``normal''
teenagers at local music clubs. They say the operation was financed
by Gravano, who had money in the bank from his deal with the
government and from the book about his life, Underboss, by Peter
Maas.
</P>
<P>
   Supposedly, Gravano's people sold more than 30,000 Ecstasy pills
a week, some laced with heroin and methamphetamine.
</P>
<P>
   To our children.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Gravano told The Republic's Dennis Wagner, ``What
would be so interesting about me? Running a legitimate business.
Being monitored by the government . . . I think it's boring.''
</P>
<P>
   At that time, the FBI tried to protect Gravano, asking The
Republic not to publish an article about him, even after Gravano
told The Republic, ``Have my values changed? No. You can't change
what you are inside. A leopard doesn't change his spots.''
</P>
<P>
   Our government relocated this guy here. Where we live. Without
telling us.
</P>
<P>
   Our government protected him and allowed him to prosper.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano and others remain in jail after their arraignment
Monday. A few weeks ago, at his first court appearance, Gravano
seemed almost confused by the $5 million bond set for him, saying,
``There is no violence in this case that I'm charged with, that I'm
aware of . I'm part of the community. I'm in business. I run a
couple of businesses in Arizona. I never ran from a case in my life
and this is, basically, in my history of crime, this is a minor
thing. Even if it's proven, which I don't think it could be
proven.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans of Mafia movies probably could picture Ray Liotta making
that speech in Goodfellas. Or maybe Joe Pesci in Casino.
</P>
<P>
   No fare lo stupido.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't them. It wasn't Robert De Niro or Al Pacino or Marlon
Brando.
</P>
<P>
   It was Salvatore ``Sammy the Bull'' Gravano, the real deal, and
the most important thing he said _ for which we can thank our
government _ was this:

   ``I'm part of the community.'' &QL;

STERN'S `BEACH' NOT EXACTLY A GREAT PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ 
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Babes in bikinis, tasteless humor, Howard Stern as executive
producer _ a combo like that should have every 15-year-old boy in
America (and everyone who thinks like one) salivating.
</P>
<P>
   So why won't they be laughing at the new FX series ``Son of the
Beac''h? Simple. It's not very funny.
</P>
<P>
   Please don't mistake this as an anti-Stern rant. I am a somewhat
reluctant fan of his radio show. But with the exception of a couple
of gleefully tasteless scenes, ``Son of the Beach'' falls flat.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Stack, whom you may remember as the star of the funnier
``Night Stand with Dick Dietrick,'' if you remember him at all,
stars as ``Beac''h's pasty-white, dumpy-lifeguard hero. He
supervises other lifeguards with more curves than brains _ the men
and the women. The evil mayor is out to get him, for reasons that
aren't really clear; she enlists a spy to help her in the first
episode, titled ``With Sex You Get Egg Roll.''
</P>
<P>
   The obvious comparisons to ``Baywatch'' are purely coincidental,
Stern said in a conference call recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``This show has as much to do with ``Baywatch'' as ``Get Smart''
had to do with 007,'' he said. ``It's its own program. It's a
ridiculous notion that we're doing ``Baywatch.'' It's a beach full
of lifeguards, which points up the ridiculousness of beach shows
and lifeguards. But other than that, I don't think I can draw a
comparison.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: Don't sue.
</P>
<P>
   The first episode has its moments. It's funny when a caption
says, ``Somewhere in the Orient'' and ``Orient'' gets scratched out
and replaced by ``Asia.'' It's funny when Stack's character makes a
joke about his childhood that we can't repeat here. And it's funny
that the evil mayor's evil son is named Cody _ also the name of the
son of Stern's archenemy, a certain soon-to-be-former co-host of
``Live With Regis and Kathie Lee.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, well . . .
</P>
<P>
   Stack, who is also a producer and writer for the show, said he
got the idea for ``Son of the Beach'' while watching ``Police
Squad,'' the series that spawned the ``Naked Gun'' movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``That gave us the impetus for this show,'' he said, ``which was
`Let's just do something that just is funny.' There's nothing
redeeming. We're not trying to make a message. We just want to make
something funny. It's like a throwback to shows like ``F-Troop''
and ``Hogan's Heroes,'' except with really hot women.''
</P>
<P>
   If ``Son of the Beach'' is to make any noise at all _ an
unlikely notion _ it will be for any controversy its
double-entendre-heavy humor is able to stir, especially among
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show is fun and light and there is nothing politically
correct about it,'' Stern said. ``We don't even care if women are
not satisfied in this program.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a given they won't be. The trouble this show will have is
when no one else is, either. &QL;

INDIANA COMPANY FAILS IN BID TO BUY ASSETS OF GUY'S FOODS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN MARGOLIES  
c. 2000 Kansas City Star An Indiana company's bid to buy the assets
of bankrupt Guy's Foods has fallen through after it was unable to
come to terms with the principal lender of Guy's, LaSalle National
Bank of Chicago.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fort Wayne-based General Products and Services Inc., which does
business under the Seyfert's and Ultima Foods brand names, had
offered to assume $14.3 million in Guy's debt in exchange for the
snack maker's assets. But at a bankruptcy court hearing Monday,
representatives of the parent company of Guy's said Guy's had
started negotiations with another group, headed by Northland lawyer
and former Missouri legislator Randall Robb.
</P>
<P>
   ``General Products and Services wasn't able to conclude a
financing agreement with LaSalle, so we didn't go forward with its
bid,'' said lawyer Steve Sutton, who is representing Guy's in the
bankruptcy proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton said Guy's would seek bankruptcy court approval of the
Robb group's bid as ``the highest and best offer.'' The group,
which includes other, unspecified investors, has offered $14.35
million for the assets of Guy's. The bid is conditioned on reaching
a financing agreement with LaSalle.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Frank Koger scheduled another hearing, at
9 a.m. Friday, to consider the bid, which requires bankruptcy court
approval.
</P>
<P>
   Robb is a former member of the Missouri House of
Representatives, to which he first won election in 1976 as a
Democrat representing part of Clay County. In August 1984 he was
narrowly defeated in the Democratic primary for the 17th District
seat in the Missouri Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Robb did not return phone calls Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Family Snacks Inc., which operates Guy's, filed for Chapter 11
protection Feb. 14, citing $5.75 million in losses over the
previous 16 months. The 62-year-old company employs 1,000 workers,
including 600 at its 325,000-square-foot complex in Liberty, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   The company's plant, after shutting down for a few weeks,
resumed production in late February after LaSalle agreed to
continue funding the operation. Guy's, which makes potato chips and
other salty snack foods, owes LaSalle more than $11 million in
principal.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Robb group, one other would-be buyer emerged at
Monday's hearing. Sutton said Guy's had been approached by a group
from St. Joseph, Mo., about a possible asset purchase. But Sutton
said the group's $14.435 million offer was contingent on receipt of
offshore money, making it less attractive to Guy's.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of General Products say they remain interested in
purchasing the assets of Guy's. A lawyer for the company, Laurence
Frazen, said General Products was continuing to pursue a financing
agreement with LaSalle. The bank apparently was not satisfied with
the amount of working capital General Products has at its disposal.
</P>
<P>
   General Products also faces another potential obstacle. United
Food and Commercial Workers Local 211, which represents most of the
Guy's labor force, says the proposed sale to General Products would
permit the Indiana company to reject the union's collective
bargaining agreement with Guy's. The union has moved for an
injunction barring the sale.
</P>
<P>
   In response, lawyers for Guy's say the agreement would remain in
effect if General Products buys the company.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two of the nation's largest newspaper companies, the Tribune Co.
and Times Mirror Co., both built around newspapers that helped
define the brawling, partisan days of 19th-century journalism,
announced Monday that they would merge. The deal ends 119 years of
ownership of The Los Angeles Times by the Otis and Chandler
families.
</P>
<P>
   The new company would seek to replicate in cities like New York
and Los Angeles the Tribune's success in offering many kinds of
media to the Chicago market. The idea is to create a network of
regional media hubs where advertisers are matched with audiences
through newspapers, television broadcasts and Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which will retain the Tribune Co. name, will own 11
daily newspapers, 22 television stations and four radio stations.
The company's newspapers would have a combined circulation of 3.6
million copies, ranking third among newspaper companies after
Gannett and Knight Ridder. Tribune's television stations reach 38.4
million households.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed acquisition of Times Mirror by the Tribune Co. was
greeted with deep skepticism by investors; Tribune shares, which
had closed Friday at $37.1875, fell swiftly to $27.75 as trading
opened, and closed at $30.8125, down 17 percent. Shares of Times
Mirror soared $37.6875, to close at $85.625.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the Tribune's corporate heirs of Robert McCormick and
Joseph Patterson, whose pugnacious conservatism often enraged their
barrel-chested union town of Chicago, are buying out and the
corporate heirs of Gen. Harrison Gray Otis and Harry Chandler, who
used The Los Angeles Times as a political hammer, helping fashion
the southern California desert into the nation's second-largest
city.
</P>
<P>
   Tribune's offer of $6.45 billion in the stock and cash deal _
not including the assumption of $1.8 billion of Times Mirror debt _
also puts an abrupt end to the mercurial five-year stewardship of
the Times Mirror chairman, Mark H. Willes. A former cereal company
executive, he brought an almost religious fervor to his quest to
streamline the company, challenging the newspaper industry to
reinvent itself, increase its audience, and toss out its
shibboleths _ notably the historic separation of the news and
business divisions.
</P>
<P>
   The essential details of the deal were arranged by members of
the Chandler family, without Willes' knowledge, according to both
Willes and Thomas Unterman, the former chief financial officer of
Times Mirror who was a primary adviser to the Chandler family
trusts.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts dismissed the flight from Tribune stock as a
short-sighted reaction, particularly considering the success the
company has achieved in its hometown. Peter P. Appert, an analyst
at Deutsche Bank, said ``the 30-percent-plus profit margins it has
had in Chicago demonstrate the leverage that can be achieved owning
both broadcast and a major newspaper in one market. This gives it
the same potential in Los Angeles and New York.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies overlap in several markets. Tribune bought KTLA in
Los Angeles, now a Warner Bros &UR; . &LR;  affiliate, in 1985. Tribune owns
WTIC, a Fox affiliate in Hartford, Conn., the location of Times
Mirror's Hartford Courant, and WPIX in New York. Newsday, the
second largest among Times Mirror newspapers with a circulation of
575,000, is based in suburban Long Island, within WPIX's viewing
area.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulations prohibiting dual ownership of a daily
newspaper and a broadcast television station are not expected to be
a problem, at least not immediately. If a company that owns a
television station in a market later acquires a daily newspaper in
that market, it can wait until its existing license expires before
seeking a waiver. None of the licenses in Hartford, New York or Los
Angeles expire before 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Appert said he believes that the dual-ownership rules are likely
to be shelved well before then.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Friday's closing stock prices, the offer for Times
Mirror consists of $3.79 billion in common stock and $2.66 billion
in cash. The cash represents a tender for about 28 million shares
at $95 per share, The remaining 40.8 million shares would be
exchanged, with Tribune offering 2.5 shares for each share of Times
Mirror.
</P>
<P>
   In the deal, Tribune was always the suitor. The courtship began
last spring when John Madigan, Tribune's chief executive,
approached Willes to discuss some types of partnership, Willes said
in an interview Monday. But when Madigan raised the prospect of a
merger, Willes said he passed on the offer because he did not
believe that a merger would be acceptable under the terms of the
Chandler Trust, which represents the interests of the Chandler
family in the company. Within days of that discussion, Willes sent
a letter to Madigan telling him so. The two did not discuss the
idea again, said Willes and several other people close to the
talks.
</P>
<P>
   Then in October, there was a major distraction for Times Mirror
executives, as a decision by Kathryn M. Downing, Willes' handpicked
successor as publisher of the L.A. Times, provoked a firestorm
within the newsroom. Downing, without the knowledge of the top
editor Michael Parks, agreed with the owners of Staples Center the
new downtown arena that the Times would share the profits of a
special Sunday magazine devoted to coverage of the center's
opening.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the ensuing furor, Downing apologized for the apparent
conflict, which she agreed endangered the newspaper's editorial
credibility. Willes also said the move was a mistake, but continued
to back Downing.
</P>
<P>
   That storm was beginning to die down in January, when Madigan
and Fuller approached two Times Mirror trustees, William Stinehart
Jr. and Warren B. Williamson, and asked if they could meet. The two
agreed and, over lunch at the California Club, a restaurant in
downtown Los Angeles, Madigan made a case for combining the two
companies. Stinehart and Williamson, said people close to the
talks, were intrigued by the idea and agreed to present it to
members of the Chandler family.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, they also hired bankers from Morgan Stanley to
explore other opportunities. But after a review of possible
partners, Unterman, the adviser to the family, said ``there was no
comparable match with the same breadth or size.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second week of February, a group of trustees went to
Chicago for a day-long presentation by the Tribune Co.'s senior
management. Using charts and graphs, the Tribune executives argued
that combining the Tribune's mix of television and newspaper assets
with Times Mirror's newspapers made sense. As importantly, said
people close to the talks, Tribune executives were suggesting that
they were willing to pay a hefty premium.
</P>
<P>
   The profit potential of the dual newspaper-and-television cities
was ``what caught the Chandler family's interest,'' said Unterman.
Once the trustees returned to Los Angeles, a legal team began
researching whether such a merger was doable under the terms of
their trust.
</P>
<P>
   But Times Mirror was not the only partner the Tribune Co. was
interested in. The company was also holding discussions with
television broadcaster Chris Craft Industries, a 50 percent
stakeholder in the UPN Network. Such a merger would bolster the
Tribune's broadcasting holdings. But ultimately the Tribune Co.
decided against a Chris Craft deal, said a person close to the
talks, because broadcasting properties were easier to buy and an
acquisition would have a negative impact on the company's future
earnings. The Tribune's attention quickly turned to Times Mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, trustees for the family trust unanimously voted
to pursue Tribune Publishing's offer, which then included a mix of
stock and cash. (The family preferred stock because the transaction
would be tax-free for them.) But it was only on Feb. 28 that
Stinehart, at the trustees urging, approached Willes about their
intent, said people close to the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was totally surprised,'' said a person involved in the
talks. ``He was deeply hurt and antagonistic to the idea.'' But
within two weeks, the deal was done and the boards met well into
Sunday night to approve the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, as Tribune executives spent the day in Los Angeles
answering the questions of analysts and reporters, Times Mirror
journalists from the L.A. Times and Newsday, not to mention The
Baltimore Sun, questioned each other, and their bosses, about their
future. There was concern in some quarters, according to one Times
journalist, about whether the Tribune Co. would offer the same
benefits as Times Mirror.
</P>
<P>
   But amid the gossip, speculation and worry was an undercurrent
of sorrow. ``It is a sad thing, in the sense that endings are
always somewhat sad, and this is the end of an important historical
era,'' said Tim Rutten, the city/county bureau chief at the Times.
``The Chandlers have been an important force in the life of Los
Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``there is a part of Los Angeles still governed
by the ethos of developer _ the quick buck, opportunism and
dynamism that goes with it. We're never been very good here at
stewardship. This is a melancholy example of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Unease was widespread. One reporter in a Newsday bureau, who
asked not to be identified, said, ``We could also be getting a new
publisher sitting in Melville, and that could mean changes all down
the line.'' Newsday's headquarters is in Melville, N.Y., on Long
Island.
</P>
<P>
   Tribune executives said in a conference call that they planned
no immediate changes in the executive ranks at any Times mirror
newspaper. And Willes made it clear he had no intention of staying
with the new company.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Madigan, Willes said, ``John has done a really
wonderful job of running that company. I've been used to being CEO
long enough that I'd just as soon not be something other than
CEO.''
</P>
<P>
   Willes, who had been openly emotional in his meetings with
employees during the day, said that his personal disappointment was
that he would not preside over what he believed would be a robust
renewal in the Times' profits, which had fallen below expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frankly an enormous personal disappointment that I didn't
have a couple more years to let everybody see how profound the
changes have been and how strong the base is on which were
growing.'' He added, ``What I would like my legacy to be is that I
cared so deeply and so profoundly about the role of newspapers in
society that I was willing to take whatever brickbats or criticism
anybody had to hurl at me, for the sake of finding ways to extend,
significantly extend, both the reach and the breadth and the depth
of what we do.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   While planning continues for the national expansion, Benchmark also
is spending $16 million to renovate existing stores near 87th
Street in Lenexa and to build a store at 135th Street and Antioch
Road.
</P>
<P>
   Construction of the new, 100,000-square-foot Benchmark Town &AMP;
Country store is scheduled to begin late this fall, Davidow said.
The store will be aimed at the high-end furniture market.
</P>
<P>
   In total, the company is spending about $30 million to create 1
million square feet of retail and warehouse space in Johnson
County, Kan. The company's total of 340 employees should top 500 by
the end of the year, Davidow said.
</P>
<P>
   The Davidow name has been around the Kansas City furniture
business for more than 70 years, but brothers Bob and Jerry started
in 1969. Their first business was manufacturing tractor seats,
before they turned to retailing with Foam City, which sold foam and
materials to recover furniture.
</P>
<P>
   They've come a ways since then. Bob Davidow says Benchmark is
projecting revenue of about $100 million in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Benchmark is ranked No. 94 on the Furniture Today
magazine list of the nation's top 100 furniture stores, with
furniture sales estimated at $39 million and total sales at $57
million.
</P>
<P>
   That's not a bad spot, considering most of the retailers on the
list are national chains with multiple stores.
</P>
<P>
   It's what you don't see at Benchmark that makes the concept
work.
</P>
<P>
   Although the roomlike furniture setups, wide aisles and
restaurants seem to impress customers as they stroll the store,
technology keeps it running.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without technology, we couldn't do it,'' Bob Davidow said.
``We couldn't manage the numbers. Things are happening in real
time, and we have to have the technology to keep up.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the technology is obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Among the first things a customer sees when entering the store
are computers with interactive displays with the store layout.
Customers seeking help inside the store can press a button that
pages a salesperson. If no one comes within 45 seconds, other
clerks are automatically beeped. If no one comes at that point, Bob
Davidow is paged.
</P>
<P>
   Salespeople carry laptop computers connected to a company
intranet by wireless modem. Customers can sit on the sofa they've
chosen while a salesperson applies for credit for their purchase
and processes the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We notice these things now because they're new and it's
whiz-bang,'' Davidow said. ``It's not going to be new and different
like that long. It's going to be part of every landscape.''
</P>
<P>
   The heart of Benchmark's business plan is a computer system that
keeps track of furniture inventory, and a warehouse that tracks
where that inventory is located.
</P>
<P>
   Customers interested in an item can pull a tag and take it to a
nearby computer to see if the item is in stock. That tag also is
scanned by a salesperson at purchase. And it's scanned again when
the customer arrives at the kiosk entrance to the warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Once the tag is scanned at the kiosk, the computer assigns the
customer a delivery dock and alerts workers in the warehouse,
telling them where the item is and which dock to deliver it to.
Every purchase is delivered within 15 minutes, Davidow said.
</P>
<P>
   The evening after the sale, the computer links with computers
owned by furniture manufacturers to tell them to send merchandise
to restock the warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   One part of the warehouse is dedicated to packaging Internet
shipments. On a recent day, warehouse workers were opening,
inspecting and repackaging Internet shipments to Boston, Florida
and California.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire industry is waiting to see how business-to-consumer
and business-to-business commerce is going to work out,'' said
Epperson, the analyst at Mann Armistead &AMP; Epperson.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't deliver furniture in a box the way you do with a CD
or a book. Getting it into the consumer's home, that's the problem.
Consumers won't accept any imperfection.''
</P>
<P>
   And furniture almost always comes with some imperfection, part
of the shipping process.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a huge advantage Benchmark has,'' Epperson said. ``They
know how to handle the furniture.''
</P>
<P>
   The order-by-Internet, same-day-pickup plan makes just as much
financial sense for the company. Online retailer Furniture.com, for
instance, spent $3.6 million on shipping in 1999 while selling only
$10.9 million in furniture. The bottom line: The company lost $43.7
million.
</P>
<P>
   Other furniture retailers say they either welcome or are
unconcerned about the challenge from the Benchmark superstore
concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``Competition is good. It draws more customers to the area,''
said Jim Loftus, general manager of the Olathe Rhodes Furniture
store across the highway from the Benchmark complex. ``Furniture
typically isn't a one-stop shopping event.''
</P>
<P>
   In Omaha, Batt said the new Benchmark complex wouldn't hurt his
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to sit here and say we're going to have
trouble,'' Batt said. ``People like to come up here and stay the
weekend and go shopping with us.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about how big you are. It's about customers saying,
`Don't waste my time. Don't have me wait in line.' It's not about
building monuments. It's not a one-up contest. It's a `take care of
the customer' contest.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Dukelow, manager of Thomasville Home Furnishings By Ed
Marlings in Shawnee, Kan., is seeing competition for the first time
for the Thomasville line of furniture. But it doesn't bother him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at it as a positive,'' Dukelow said. ``His
influx of advertising dollars will draw more interest to the
market. I've always been jealous of his advertising budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Orman recently opened T. Orman's Furniture and Flooring in
south Overland Park, Kan., at a location where he and his brother
used to run a furniture store together. He said T. Orman's wouldn't
be affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``His business is almost the antithesis of ours,'' Orman said of
Benchmark. ``His store will bifurcate the market. He will draw
those people who want instant gratification and aren't worried
about quality. We will continue to draw those people who want to
put some emotional investment into their purchase.''

BENCHMARK OWNERS HOPE TO SPREAD FURNITURE SUPERSTORE CONCEPT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HAYES  
c. 2000 Kansas City Star OLATHE, Kan. _ Bob Davidow has built what
may be the largest furniture store in the country in an old
printing plant and some former farm fields in Olathe.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The new Benchmark furniture complex southwest of 119th Street
and Interstate 35 drew between 8,000 and 10,000 customers during
its opening weekend March 4 and 5. Customers apparently liked what
they saw, spending more than $1 million during the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Davidow and his brother, Jerry Davidow, want to take on the
rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   As the Davidows and their families opened the final phase of the
725,000-square-foot furniture ``campus'' in Olathe, they already
were meeting with potential partners to build even larger stores in
15 other U.S. cities.
</P>
<P>
   The Davidows want to use the network of stores, accompanying
warehouses and the Internet to build a $3 billion-a-year ``click
and brick'' business that would capture 5 percent of the $60
billion U.S. retail furniture market within six years.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Davidow says the click-and-mortar approach _ allowing people
to shop on the Internet, drive to the store to check out the
furniture and take it home with them _ is the best way for the
furniture industry to grow in the Internet economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new model for the furniture industry,'' Davidow
said. ``E-commerce sites that don't incorporate a physical location
will never work. We'll win because we offer both.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where would you rather shop: a Web site where you order a
product and it might come in six weeks or three months, probably
damaged or the wrong color, or someplace where you can see it
online and pick it up the same day?'' Davidow said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Benchmark stores in Johnson County, the national
stores will carry the name BeHome, the address of the furniture
retailer's Web site. BeHome.com, which went online in 1995, was the
first furniture retailer on the Internet and one of the earliest
e-commerce sites.
</P>
<P>
   Davidow says the company plans to build the BeHome stores on the
outskirts of metropolitan areas with populations of 3 million or
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll have to drive to get to us. We're a destination
store,'' Davidow said. ``The goal is to be within a three-hour
drive of 80 percent of the U.S. population.''
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for Benchmark to choose a financial partner and a
location for its first superstore by the end of the year and open
the store in mid- to late 2001. The plan calls for all 15 stores to
open within six years.
</P>
<P>
   Each store//warehouse complex will have 1 million square feet _
600,000 square feet of retail space and a 400,000-square-foot
warehouse. Each would cost about $65 million, Davidow said.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, each store would gross between $180 and $200 million in
sales annually, with a profit of between $22 and $24 million, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   News of Davidow's plan took furniture suppliers by surprise when
he announced it during an industry breakfast meeting a few days
before the Olathe store opened. The expansion plans were featured
on the covers of the retail furniture industry's two leading trade
magazines last week.
</P>
<P>
   But Davidow has always had the industry's attention, said Jerry
Epperson, retail furniture's leading industry analyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within the industry, if you were to pick up the phone and call
25 people and ask them what's really going on in the furniture
industry, 23 of the 25 would tell you to call Bob Davidow,'' said
Epperson, of Richmond, Va. ``They'd say, `All I know is what Bob
told me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It's not just any old furniture store where you can eat at a
restaurant that serves a pretty mean grilled salmon sandwich with
curried mayonnaise or a portabello mushroom sandwich with grilled
onions.
</P>
<P>
   But Benchmark in Olathe isn't just any old furniture store.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Dexter's Restaurant, which more or less gets lost
inside the Benchmark campus. It offers made-to-order dishes, not
cafeteria food. It is managed by former Hyatt Regency Crown Center
hotel executive Dexter Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   The 230-seat restaurant includes four tables equipped with
computers and Internet access. ``If people want to check our prices
online, they can,'' Davidow said. ``We can take it.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's only one of four food stops in the furniture store, all
operated by Myron Green Food Service Inc. The restaurants alone
employ about 30 persons.
</P>
<P>
   A coffee bar near the restaurant offers scones, bisciotti and
``cascading cappuccino.'' Across the store is Bob and Jerry's _ an
old-fashioned ice cream parlor that won't put Ben &AMP; Jerry's out of
business, but is a bit of a nod to Benchmark's corporate sense of
humor.
</P>
<P>
   And then, of course, there's furniture. Lots of furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Working with St. Louis-based furniture manufacturer Furniture
Brands International, Benchmark built a 160,000-square-foot store
(about the size of a SuperTarget store) to showcase that company's
product line.
</P>
<P>
   The new store was so large it even surprised Lynn Chipperfield,
senior vice president of Furniture Brands.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can turn 360 degrees and everywhere you look is our
product,'' Chipperfield said.
</P>
<P>
   Adjoining the new store is Benchmark Express, which carries
lower-priced furniture and also houses Benchmark's home office
center.
</P>
<P>
   Benchmark bought and remodeled the former Ringier America Inc.
printing plant and opened Benchmark Express six years ago. Last
year the company converted warehouse space in the rear of the
building into retail space. The facility now is about 240,000
square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Davidow says it takes 45 minutes _ without stopping to shop _ to
cover the entire Benchmark campus.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of hundred yards behind the store is a
state-of-the-art, computerized, 325,000-square-foot warehouse with
67 cargo doors _ 34 for customers to take merchandise away and 33
for truckers to bring furniture in.
</P>
<P>
   Davidow thinks long delays in furniture delivery hurt the
business in the 1980s and 1990s. ``People just weren't satisfied
waiting weeks and weeks and then having their furniture come in
damaged, or the wrong color,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking that cycle means keeping an inventory of about $20
million worth of furniture. ``It takes a lot of stock to be able to
say you'll have everything available the same day,'' Davidow said.
</P>
<P>
   The Olathe facility probably has the distinction of being the
largest furniture store in the country, overshadowing even the
Nebraska Furniture Mart in Omaha, Neb. The sprawling Omaha store,
owned by Berkshire Hathaway Inc., bills itself as ``the largest
single home-furnishings retailer in North America.''
</P>
<P>
   Note to Berkshire billionaire Warren Buffett: Better rethink
that.
</P>
<P>
   The Olathe Benchmark complex has 400,000 square feet of retail
furniture space. Nebraska Furniture Mart has about 500,000 square
feet of retail space _ but more than 100,000 is used for
electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Advantage Benchmark.
</P>
<P>
   Bragging rights are fun, but in the long run ``I'm not sure that
it means anything,'' Davidow said.
</P>
<P>
   His competitors also are downplaying the size issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Davidow has never done anything understated,'' said Robert
Batt, executive vice president of Nebraska Furniture. ``Now it's a
matter of carrying it out.''

COUNTRY MUSIC STAR FROM KANSAS GIVES BACK TO HER COMMUNITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM PERRIN  
c. 2000 Kansas City Star WELLSVILLE, Kan. _ Chely Wright has
performed at venues from coast to coast and even overseas. This
weekend, she's scheduled to sing at the Grand Ole Opry, the country
music mecca in Nashville.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But on Monday she was in Wellsville, performing a free
mini-concert in a gym full of students, school employees and
townspeople at Wellsville School, where she graduated in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the weirdest phenomenon,'' said Wright, whose father,
Stan, still lives nearby in Spring Hill, Kan. ``Looking at all the
people around who taught me algebra or punched my lunch ticket, I
no longer feel like the country music star who has traveled around
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The occasion for Wright's visit was to announce her new
charitable foundation's first donation _ about $6,000 worth of
musical instruments, sheet music and money to Wellsville schools.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation, ``Reading, Writing &AMP; Rhythm,'' was formed to
benefit music programs in small-town schools. Wright is hoping to
make two more donations of similar size later this year to schools
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want any kid to miss out on (participating in music
programs) because they don't have money,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, 29, performed three of her singles, ``Shut Up and
Drive,'' ``Single White Female'' and ``It Was,'' which is No. 15 on
the Billboard magazine country chart. ``Single White Female'' was
her first No. 1 single.
</P>
<P>
   Wright had the crowd on its feet and clapping throughout her
acoustic set. She took questions from students and talked about how
she enjoys sharing memories of Wellsville in media interviews.
</P>
<P>
   After the visit to the school, Wright, some associates and
fan-club members made a few stops around town where she talked to
old friends.
</P>
<P>
   Wright was born in Kansas City, Mo., but attended Wellsville
schools from kindergarten through 12th grade. She said she was
involved in band, choir and journalism in high school.
</P>
<P>
   She was a member of the girls basketball team that played in a
state tournament in 1988. Earlier that season, when the 3-point
basket was adopted, she became the first Wellsville athlete to make
one in a game.
</P>
<P>
   But music was always her main interest, and she left for
Nashville, Tenn., to begin her career after graduating. Monday, she
encouraged students to believe in themselves and pursue their
dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope what Chely said today, young people will take with
them,'' Stan Wright said. ``It can happen for anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   She's keeping pretty good company these days. She is one of five
nominees for the Academy of Country Music's female vocalist of the
year, along with Faith Hill, Martina McBride, Jo Dee Messina and
Shania Twain. The winner will be announced May 3.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Johnson, a sophomore who plays tuba in the school band,
said not all his classmates are country fans, but most everyone has
at least one of Wright's recordings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of shocking to see someone like her come from this
town,'' he said. ``I guess she actually cares. It's nice that she
came back and she's proud of her hometown.''

FBI'S 10 MOST WANTED LIST CELEBRATES 50 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK MORRIS  
c. 2000 Kansas City Star KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ With a nod to its roots
in Kansas City's colorful criminal past, the FBI's 10 Most Wanted
Fugitives list celebrates its golden anniversary Tuesday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thomas James Holden _ the list's first of 458 members _ had a
long local history that included an escape from the federal
penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kan., in 1930 and his recapture in
1932 on a Kansas City golf course.
</P>
<P>
   After his official release from prison, Holden landed on the
FBI's first top-10 list when he murdered his wife and her two
brothers after a Chicago drinking party. FBI agents arrested him in
1951 near Beaverton, Ore., when a resident recognized him from a
picture in a local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's anniversary observes half a century of media and
public assistance in putting violent criminals in jail,'' said
Larry McCormick, special agent in charge of the Kansas City FBI
office.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI's top-10 list got its start in 1949 when a reporter
asked the FBI for a roster of the ``toughest guys'' it wanted to
capture.
</P>
<P>
   Impressed with public reaction to the resulting story in the
Washington Daily News, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover formally
initiated the program on March 14, 1950.
</P>
<P>
   That bond forged between citizens, the bureau and the press
remains the list's greatest strength, FBI officials said.
</P>
<P>
   About one-third of the 429 top-10 arrests have come after
citizens referred information to the bureau, McCormick said. In
recent years, the bureau has attributed 13 arrests to the
television program ``America's Most Wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   As a public relations tool, the program works because it gets to
the point, said Bob Bernstein of Bernstein-Rein Advertising Inc. He
wouldn't change a thing about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a simple, clean format,'' Bernstein said. ``It goes right
to the heart of the issue and (FBI officials have) stayed focused
with it. If you keep something that goes to the point and stays
with the issue, it transcends the time barrier.''
</P>
<P>
   The list has changed over the years. Lists in the 1950s were
made up primarily of bank robbers, burglars and car thieves.
</P>
<P>
   Social revolutionaries populated the lists of the turbulent
1960s, which also featured the first appearance of James Earl Ray
for the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. Ray
appeared again on the list nine years later following his escape
from a Tennessee prison.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI's emphasis on organized crime and terrorism in the 1970s
continues on the list today, with the addition last summer of
accused terrorist Osama bin Laden and alleged East Coast mobster
James J. Bulger.
</P>
<P>
   Serial murderers such as Ted Bundy or particularly notorious
killers, such as Andrew Cunanan, also have found a place on recent
lists.
</P>
<P>
   During the past 50 years, 23 of the top-10 fugitives committed
their crimes in Missouri and Kansas. Eighteen top-10 criminals were
arrested in Missouri and Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Robert J. Mahoney, chairman of Rockhurst University's
sociology department, said the list is a good reflection of the
nation's law enforcement priorities at any particular moment and a
way to bring attention to an issue.
</P>
<P>
   Why else, Mahoney noted, would bin Laden have been included?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not likely he's going to turn up in New Jersey,'' Mahoney
said. ``The point of it is to draw attention to the issue of
terrorism. This does have some consequences. It puts pressure on
somebody like bin Laden and puts attention on him worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   Several factors are considered before putting a fugitive on the
list, according to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Nominees from all 56 FBI field offices are reviewed by the
bureau's Criminal Investigative Division and Office of Public and
Congressional Affairs in Washington, D.C. Proposed ``top-tenners''
then are forwarded to the FBI director for final approval.
</P>
<P>
   Potential candidates must be a ``particularly dangerous menace
to society'' or have a long history of serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the FBI must believe that national publicity will help the
bureau arrest the fugitive. That publicity already has gone beyond
print and broadcast media and even international boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   A central attraction at the bureau's Web site, www.fbi.gov, the
list already has notched its first arrest resulting from Internet
publicity.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, a Web surfer sparked an intense manhunt in Guatemala
for bank robbery suspect Leslie Isben Rogge after his picture
showed up on theInternet. Rogge quickly surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to new technology, the 10 Most Wanted list remains
effective, shedding its G-Man quaintness and is heading into
cyberspace.

   EUROPE-GENES-FOOD (The Hague, Netherlands) _ In Europe, the
debate over genetically modified food is as much about theater as
it is about science. Polls show that few Americans realize that
nearly two-thirds of the products on supermarket shelves contain
ingredients from genetically altered plants. But British tabloids
routinely call such ingredients ``Frankenfood,'' and pollsters say
only 1 percent of Britons think genetically modifying plants has
any value at all. By Donald G. McNeil Jr.

   JAPAN-IMMIG (Sagamihara City, Japan) _ Little known to its
inhabitants, who include a sprinkling of Chinese and Southeast
Asians, this otherwise unremarkable town an hour outside of Tokyo
could soon be known as a forerunner of Japan's 21st century
immigration boom. Shrinking faster than any other nation, this
country's population is projected to decline by 17 percent during
the next half century. Government experts, demographers and
economists say that as Japan loses people _ and workers _ the only
way for it to maintain its lofty living standards is to quickly
begin accepting immigrants in far greater numbers and to abandon
the age-old comfort of its near-uniform ethnicity. By Howard W.
French.

has been quietly transforming itself in recent years into what top
executives say is a new media company, which is funneling old media
content and ideas into television, cable, radio and internet

than 16 television stations, reaching more than a third of U.S.
households. There were four radio stations, an entertainment unit,
a venture capital arm, and an educational publishing unit. The
company was an early investor in America Online and Yahoo, and owns

FERNANDEZ'S SAVE ON PENALTY SHOT SPARKS STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Don't go down too early. Whatever you do don't go
down too early.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas Stars goalie Manny Fernandez said that to himself as New
York Rangers winger Radek Dvorak came swooping in on a penalty shot
with 29.5 seconds remaining in the second period Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had looked like a fool earlier by going down too early on
(Petr) Nedved's goal,'' Fernandez said, explaining his thinking.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't go down. Dvorak, unlike Nedved, didn't score. A half
of a period later, Stars winger Jamie Langenbrunner did.
</P>
<P>
   And just like that, what easily could've and probably should've
been a Stars loss instead became a 4-3 Stars victory against a
desperate and hungry Rangers bunch at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fought all period to try to get it back to tied and go into
the third 3-3. That would've been a real back breaker,'' Stars
center Mike Modano said of Dvorak's penalty shot. ``Manny made a
big save.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Fernandez's blocker save allowed his teammates to squeak
into the locker room deadlocked instead of down. Langenbrunner's
goal, his second of the night, allowed them to squeak out of New
York with their second victory in as many nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's a typical Dallas win right there,'' Stars
captain Derian Hatcher said. ``Lately.''
</P>
<P>
   The typical part is they've been atypical. The usual defensive
wall has shown a few cracks.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars played the first period as if they were ``stuck in the
mud,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. They were outshot 14-8. They
were outscored 2-1. Exactly 2:49 had expired in the second period
when the Rangers took a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Hatcher wasn't kidding when he said these are the kind of
games the Stars win lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another team lets down, gets comfortable, and I think, that's
when we take advantage of that team,'' Hatcher said.
</P>
<P>
   Stars winger Scott Thornton took advantage of a pretty Joe
Nieuwendyk pass to slice New York's lead to 3-2 at 7:03 of the
second period. The game-tying goal came as a result of the
forechecking by the Stars' fourth line of Kirk Muller, Roman
Lyashenko and Jon Sim with the actual goal coming from Sim at 16:10
of the second period.
</P>
<P>
   The game was once again tied. The Stars were on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   But there was Dvorak breaking down the ice all by himself. Well,
until Stars defenseman Sergei Zubov hauled him down. The referee
didn't hesitate, his arm going up immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was ready to take him the first time around, but I guess we
had the rematch going,'' Fernandez joked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually was just happy he didn't wind up from the red line.
That probably could've gone in.''
</P>
<P>
   Because while Fernandez stopped Dvorak's shot _ one of his 31
saves _ with his blocker, he wasn't doing so well with the easier
stuff. The reason the Rangers had a 3-1 lead was because Fernandez
struggled near the end of the first and beginning of the second
period.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kind of gave them a couple of freebies early and then
stoned them from there,'' Hitchcock said. ``He was good at the end,
eh?''
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a guy subbing for usual starter Ed Belfour, who
hasn't played since being charged with misdemeanor assault and
resisting arrest on Wednesday. His best save wasn't even on the
penalty shot. He made another two in the final 10 seconds to
preserve the victory.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was created by Langenbrunner, who scored the Stars'
first and last goals. The game winner was a beauty, too, sneaking
between Rangers goalie Mike Richter and the post at 11:43 of the
third period. The play began when Modano chipped the puck away from
two Rangers along the boards, allowing Langenbrunner to skate in
pretty free. nn

STERN'S `BEACH' NOT EXACTLY A GREAT PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILLY GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Babes in bikinis, tasteless humor, Howard Stern as executive
producer _ a combo like that should have every 15-year-old boy in
America (and everyone who thinks like one) salivating.
</P>
<P>
   So why won't they be laughing at the new FX series ``Son of the
Beac''h? Simple. It's not very funny.
</P>
<P>
   Please don't mistake this as an anti-Stern rant. I am a somewhat
reluctant fan of his radio show. But with the exception of a couple
of gleefully tasteless scenes, ``Son of the Beach'' falls flat.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Stack, whom you may remember as the star of the funnier
``Night Stand with'' ``Dick Dietrick,'' if you remember him at all,
stars as ``Beac''h's pasty-white, dumpy-lifeguard hero. He
supervises other lifeguards with more curves than brains _ the men
and the women. The evil mayor is out to get him, for reasons that
aren't really clear; she enlists a spy to help her in the first
episode, titled ``With Sex You Get Egg Roll.''
</P>
<P>
   The obvious comparisons to ``Baywatch'' are purely coincidental,
Stern said in a conference call recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``This show has as much to do with ``Baywatch'' as ``Get Smart''
had to do with 007,'' he said. ``It's its own program. It's a
ridiculous notion that we're doing ``Baywatch.'' It's a beach full
of lifeguards, which points up the ridiculousness of beach shows
and lifeguards. But other than that, I don't think I can draw a
comparison.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: Don't sue.
</P>
<P>
   The first episode has its moments. It's funny when a caption
says, ``Somewhere in the Orient'' and ``Orient'' gets scratched out
and replaced by ``Asia.'' It's funny when Stack's character makes a
joke about his childhood that we can't repeat here. And it's funny
that the evil mayor's evil son is named Cody _ also the name of the
son of Stern's archenemy, a certain soon-to-be-former co-host of
``Live With Regis and Kathie Lee.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, well . . .
</P>
<P>
   Stack, who is also a producer and writer for the show, said he
got the idea for ``Son of the Beach'' while watching ``Police
Squad,'' the series that spawned the ``Naked Gun'' movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``That gave us the impetus for this show,'' he said, ``which was
`Let's just do something that just is funny.' There's nothing
redeeming. We're not trying to make a message. We just want to make
something funny. It's like a throwback to shows like ``F-Troop''
and ``Hogan's Heroes,'' except with really hot women.''
</P>
<P>
   If ``Son of the Beach'' is to make any noise at all _ an
unlikely notion _ it will be for any controversy its
double-entendre-heavy humor is able to stir, especially among
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show is fun and light and there is nothing politically
correct about it,'' Stern said. ``We don't even care if women are
not satisfied in this program.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a given they won't be. The trouble this show will have is
when no one else is, either. &QL;

DINOSAURS' EVOLUTION CONTINUES EVEN TODAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
 (EDITORS: ALSO MOVED IN THE ``E'' CATEGORY) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dinosaurs keep evolving. It doesn't matter that they died out en
masse 65 million years ago, that not a single giant lizard remains
alive, even in some remote and steamy Amazonian plateau. None of
that matters: They evolve anyway.
</P>
<P>
   They evolved from cold-blooded sluggards to warm-blooded
amphetamine addicts. They grew feathers. The carnivores bent over
from the anthropomorphized Godzilla posture they used to have to
something a lot more like a gigantic clucking hen.
</P>
<P>
   Such changes shouldn't be surprising. As scholarship advances,
our images of the dinosaurs have had to step forward, too. But it
isn't only paleontology that has caused the changes in our sense of
prehistoric life. It is also politics.
</P>
<P>
   We have a more inclusive sense of culture these days, so the
primarily European and North American bias we have had in the past
about our Mesozoic predecessors has changed to make room for Asia,
Africa and South America.
</P>
<P>
   When I was a boy, fascinated by everything dinosaurian in the
1950s, there were about 20 or so beasts that made up the
``canonical'' list of dinosaurs. They included brontosaurs,
stegosaurs, tyrannosaurs, triceratops and a variety of oddly
ornamented hadrosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   These were the basic animals that populated our vision of a
misty, green tropical prehistory. They are the beasts of ``King
Kong, Lost World'' and dozens of other pop culture permutations of
the terrible lizards.
</P>
<P>
   They also were the fossils found in Wyoming, Utah and New
Jersey. They were ``our'' dinosaurs, and they somehow seemed more
important for that.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there were always more genera of fossil than the popular
ones. And with a recent explosion in dino digs, the number of
official dinosaur genera has increased to something like 350. And
that is just genera: Several of them also include multiple species.
By one count, there are 15 species of triceratops.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in the popular awareness of dinosaur genera _ as
evidenced in many of the recent books on the subject for the
general reader _ is as much a change in our openness to diversity
as it is the number of new fossils found.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, a few ``representative types'' were enough to
define the prehistoric world. But now, those types _ and their
origins _ seem too limited.
</P>
<P>
   And further evidence of this are the many names for dinosaurs
that sound multiculti on the tongue: jubbulpuria (India);
yangchuanosaurus (China); austrosaurus (Australia); majungasaurus
(Africa); riojasaurus (Argentina). There is even an antarctosaurus.
</P>
<P>
   And from the Navajo Reservation in northern Arizona comes the
segisaurus, from Tsegi Canyon.
</P>

   Just open the new book, ``Walking With Dinosaurs: A Natural

<P>
   No doubt there is a long way to go before the laplatasaurus of
South America supplants the more familiar North American
apatosaurus (formerly the brontosaurus) in third-graders'

will find newer, sexier and more politically diverse dinosaurs
showing up.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Plans are being laid for a visit by George W. Bush,
the Republican presidential candidate, to Europe ahead of this
year's election. The aim would be to help him get to know some of
the leading figures on the world stage, but also to reinforce
Bush's stature.
</P>
<P>
   The challengers in the presidential election, irascible and
independent-minded John McCain and the sleepy if smart Bill
Bradley, have now withdrawn. That leaves Republican George W. Bush,
the governor of Texas and Democrat Al Gore, vice president. Both
are mainstream, slightly dull figures with highly-polished
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   As Molly Ivins, doyenne of the Texas press put it last week:
``Oh, pooh, the fun's over.'' Or as Gail Collins put it in the New
York Times, ``Maybe it will be good for our character. It's really
superficial, you know, this desire for a chief executive with
charisma.''
</P>
<P>
   But the race between the two candidates is very close, and Bush
has lost what was a double-digit margin in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is slightly ahead, according to the latest opinion polls.
At 43 percent to 40 percent, according to NBC and the Wall Street
Journal, the gap is within the polls' margin of error; but the
trend is clear.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has a potentially more serious problem: he is simply not
seen as presidential material by many people. When voters were
asked about ``the right experience and the ability to do the job of
president,'' nearly half preferred Gore; less than a third picked
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel battle-tested and that's what a lot of people wanted to
see,'' said Bush last week. ``I think the people saw I could get
whipped and bounce back.'' But he has a broader problem of stature
which the campaign has not resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams are gearing up for the campaign now, with months to
go until the party conventions. Some time before then _ perhaps in
May _ both campaigns are considering international tours, including
visits to Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is already well-known on the international stage; for Bush,
a trip abroad is a more important venture.
</P>
<P>
   In part, it is his evident lack of knowledge of international
affairs that has hurt him. Bush is a fine man, but apparently he
thinks that Canada is run by a plate of chips and cottage cheese.
</P>
<P>
   The governor was campaigning in Michigan when a reporter
delivered the news that the Canadian prime minister, Jean Poutine,
had endorsed him. ``I'm honored,'' said Bush. ``I appreciate his
strong statement. He understands our belief in free trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, the prime minister of Canada is Jean Chretien. Poutine is
a favorite dish of the Quebecois, an unpalatable mess which few
beyond Canada care to sample.
</P>
<P>
   Ignorance of these matters is hardly crippling in itself _ few
Americans take much notice of politics up north, let alone Canadian
cuisine, and the Canadian prankster who tried it on with Bush has
had plenty of success with many other politicians.
</P>
<P>
   The point is that cheap shots at Bush's knowledge of foreign
affairs are becoming all too common.
</P>
<P>
   His uneasy relationship with spoken English does not help.
``When I was coming up, it was a dangerous world and we knew
exactly who the they were. It was us versus them, and it was clear
who them was. Today, we're not so sure who the they are. But we
know they're there,'' he said on one memorable occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is madmen in the world, and there are terror,'' he said
on another.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, by contrast, has little to worry about in terms of the
legacy of the campaign. One of his weaknesses going into the
election was that (like many vice presidents) he had come to be
seen as ineffectual, but the campaign has started to change that.
</P>
<P>
   His fight against Bradley showed him to be tough and
resourceful, even vicious at times. He will be attacked for being
part of President Bill Clinton's administration, but by contrast he
has few weaknesses when it comes to experience.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has relatively little track record in politics by
comparison. He has been governor of Texas since 1994, but the post
carries fewer responsibilities than in many other states. The
state's legislature meets only every other year; it is not an
especially arduous job.
</P>
<P>
   The real problem for Bush is that he seems lightweight. The
jokes and cartoons of him play on the image; one columnist last
week referred to the contest between the two candidates as the
pinhead versus the sleaze, meaning Gore.
</P>
<P>
   While the latter description will please Bush, the former won't.
The Democrats had hoped since last year to paint Bush as an ``Empty
Suit,'' and that view seems to be gaining ground.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, by contrast, may be no John Kennedy but he does at least
have a certain solidity.
</P>
<P>
   Bush ``whined his way through several states yearning for his
family, his dog and his own no-steam shaving mirror back home,''
says columnist Collins. ``Mr. Gore just seems to be real, real good
at enduring discomfort. In the age of indulgence, we've got a stoic
running for president.''
</P>
<P>
   There is one other question about Bush's stature. In the last
twelve presidential elections, the shorter candidate has won only
twice, in 1972 and 1976. Bush is five feet eleven inches, a little
taller in his cowboy boots. Gore is six feet one inch. Even a visit
to see Tony Blair can't change that. &QL;

IT WASN'T ON HIS OWN TERMS, BUT MARINO AT PEACE WITH DECISION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If it's true that you can judge a man by the company he keeps,
what should history make of Dan Marino?
</P>
<P>
   His NFL passing records are so gaudy as to invite chuckles.
Marino threw 48 touchdown passes in the 1984 season. The number is
exactly as many as Troy Aikman has thrown _ total _ in the past
three Cowboys seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was Marino who said goodbye to football Monday on what
was anything but his own terms.
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota Vikings had called, and coach Dennis Green had
tempted the 17-year veteran last week with talk about a
championship waiting to be won. Sure, Marino said Monday, ``you get
excited when a coach calls you.''
</P>
<P>
   But the coach of the Miami Dolphins never called, nor did the
former head coach. The ``Dan thing,'' as new Dolphins coach Dave
Wannstedt called it, lingered in the South Florida air like swamp
gas.
</P>
<P>
   Marino announced the proper decision Monday. At age 38, and with
remnants of a pinched neck nerve and an old Achilles' injury in his
past, Marino didn't need to be wearing a purple Vikings jersey,
running for his life in the shotgun, trying to learn somebody's new
system.
</P>
<P>
   At the tail end of his Broadway marquee career, Joe Namath
ignominiously slipped into a Los Angeles Rams uniform. Johnny
Unitas tried to play out the string as a San Diego Charger. Both
moves produced more winces than memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it comes down to a football decision and a health
decision,'' Marino told a news gathering in Davie, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   In the audience beside the media were more than a dozen former
teammates and coaches, including his former coach, Hall of Famer
Don Shula. Marino has such poise and presence that he thanked
nearly every one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say I've been blessed with a career greater than I could
imagine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to miss it. I'm going to miss everything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, despite the footprints that Wannstedt left in running
away from the issue, the Dolphins didn't want Dan Marino anymore.
His health and rumored declining skills had been an issue with
Wannstedt's predecessor, and his 1999 season was a washout. He
arrived in Texas Stadium on Thanksgiving Day, after being out five
games with the neck injury, and the Cowboys intercepted Marino five
times en route to a 20-0 stroll.
</P>
<P>
   Could he have returned? Well, Marino plays golf with the boss,
owner Wayne Huizenga, so anything was possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I could've,'' Marino said, fumbling for the right words.
``But circumstances, last year, things like that ... I felt I
probably wouldn't be a Dolphin after that last game. ''
</P>
<P>
   Conspicuous by his absence from the news conference was the
``circumstances'' himself, Jimmy Johnson. Maybe Johnson felt he was
not invited. Maybe he hadn't been reading the newspapers for the
past 62 days.
</P>
<P>
   To not attend Marino's retirement announcement was tacky, at
best, and mostly inexcusable.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Marino, a class act to the end, took the high road.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about Johnson, Marino answered, ``I would just have
to say that our relationship was up and down at times. We had some
great days together, some fun times. Sometimes I wasn't very happy
here, while he was coaching. And that's just being honest.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson looked upon Marino as an anchor, dragging down his Super
Bowl cruise ship. Dolphins fans, on the other hand, looked at
Marino with nothing but reverence.
</P>
<P>
   Marino's charitable work within the community included helping
to finance a wing of a new children's hospital. He is as revered in
South Florida as Shula.
</P>
<P>
   NFL perfectionists will argue that because he never won a Super
Bowl, Marino's career work was an incomplete canvas, and thus to be
footnoted accordingly. A national publication last November rated
him no higher than sixth on the list of NFL's great quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Bowl victory, Marino sighed Monday, just wasn't meant
to be. He said that he is at peace with his decision to retire.
</P>
<P>
   It was the proper conclusion, but the Dolphins aided and abetted
it poorly.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Dan thing'' will leave a taint on the new Dolphins regime
all the way to the Super Bowl _ should they ever, ever get there.

DINOSAURS' EVOLUTION CONTINUES EVEN TODAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
 (EDITORS: RETRANSMITTING  /  ALSO MOVED IN THE ``L'' CATEGORY) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dinosaurs keep evolving. It doesn't matter that they died out en
masse 65 million years ago, that not a single giant lizard remains
alive, even in some remote and steamy Amazonian plateau. None of
that matters: They evolve anyway.
</P>
<P>
   They evolved from cold-blooded sluggards to warm-blooded
amphetamine addicts. They grew feathers. The carnivores bent over
from the anthropomorphized Godzilla posture they used to have to
something a lot more like a gigantic clucking hen.
</P>
<P>
   Such changes shouldn't be surprising. As scholarship advances,
our images of the dinosaurs have had to step forward, too. But it
isn't only paleontology that has caused the changes in our sense of
prehistoric life. It is also politics.
</P>
<P>
   We have a more inclusive sense of culture these days, so the
primarily European and North American bias we have had in the past
about our Mesozoic predecessors has changed to make room for Asia,
Africa and South America.
</P>
<P>
   When I was a boy, fascinated by everything dinosaurian in the
1950s, there were about 20 or so beasts that made up the
``canonical'' list of dinosaurs. They included brontosaurs,
stegosaurs, tyrannosaurs, triceratops and a variety of oddly
ornamented hadrosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   These were the basic animals that populated our vision of a
misty, green tropical prehistory. They are the beasts of ``King
Kong, Lost World'' and dozens of other pop culture permutations of
the terrible lizards.
</P>
<P>
   They also were the fossils found in Wyoming, Utah and New
Jersey. They were ``our'' dinosaurs, and they somehow seemed more
important for that.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there were always more genera of fossil than the popular
ones. And with a recent explosion in dino digs, the number of
official dinosaur genera has increased to something like 350. And
that is just genera: Several of them also include multiple species.
By one count, there are 15 species of triceratops.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in the popular awareness of dinosaur genera _ as
evidenced in many of the recent books on the subject for the
general reader _ is as much a change in our openness to diversity
as it is the number of new fossils found.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, a few ``representative types'' were enough to
define the prehistoric world. But now, those types _ and their
origins _ seem too limited.
</P>
<P>
   And further evidence of this are the many names for dinosaurs
that sound multiculti on the tongue: jubbulpuria (India);
yangchuanosaurus (China); austrosaurus (Australia); majungasaurus
(Africa); riojasaurus (Argentina). There is even an antarctosaurus.
</P>
<P>
   And from the Navajo Reservation in northern Arizona comes the
segisaurus, from Tsegi Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Just open the new book, ``Walking With Dinosaurs: A Natural
History'' (DK Publishing, $25), and there on a single page you find
leaellynasaura, muttaburrasaurus and koolasuchus, names with a
decidedly third-world flavor on the tongue.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt there is a long way to go before the laplatasaurus of
South America supplants the more familiar North American
apatosaurus (formerly the brontosaurus) in third-graders'
imaginations, but open up any recent book on the subject and you
will find newer, sexier and more politically diverse dinosaurs

   The thing about thrillers is that so many of them are bad.
Abysmal, even. It's a genre so plagued by hack writers and
bush-league prose that when you find one like this, you want to
call it by another name. But a thriller it is _ the long, patient
kind, with underplayed dialogue and characters who sidestep
stereotype every time it shows up to claim them. The protagonist is
Charlie Ravich, a former Vietnam fighter pilot and POW now in his
late 50s who faces crisis in his private life and in his
multimillion-dollar corporate affairs. Harrison spends much of his
book establishing a thin connection between Charlie and a young
woman named Christina Welles, who has just been released from
prison and who, with her former boyfriend, is suspected of stealing
from a mobster who really, REALLY, wants his money back. There's
sex. There's violence (we don't want to spoil your fun if you have
a taste for it, but for the sake of the squeamish, we'll mention a
little torture scene involving an electric drill and a circular saw
_ and that's not the last of it). If you can take the gore, this
book is enough to give a weak genre a good name. &QL;

 &UR; ``CINEMA SOUTHWEST'' &QL; 
 &UR; By John A. Murray (Northland, $21.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The photo on the cover is of John Ford making a scene from ``The
Searchers'' in 1956, but that's just the predictable side of
filmmaking in the American Southwest. Think of the alternatives. In
1965, Max Von Sydow, as Jesus, delivered the Sermon on the Mount on
Utah's Green River Overlook in ``The Greatest Story Ever Told.''
Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda camped in Anasazi ruins on their way
east in ``Easy Rider.'' Robert Duvall turned his life around on the
Texas prairie in ``Tender Mercies,'' and in ``Bonnie and Clyde,''
Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway robbed an actual bank in the rural
community of Pilot Point, Texas _ the same bank that the real
Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow had robbed about 40 years earlier.
In this book, due out at the end of the month, Murray looks at the
Southwest and its starring role in so many American films. Included
are some great photographs _ our favorite, we confess, is of John
Wayne (in ``She Wore a Yellow Ribbon'') looking grandly out at that
mist-shrouded Big Daddy of film locations, Monument Valley. &QL;

 &UR; ``EATING WELL FOR OPTIMUM HEALTH'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Andrew Weil (Knopf, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's a chapter here in which Weil sets out to devise what he
calls ``the worst diet in the world,'' which after a few paragraphs
sounded so suspiciously like our own bill of fare that we began to
wonder whether Weil had us under surveillance. It was humbling, but
more fun to read than, say, the section called ``A Healing Story:
From French Fries to Kale,'' or ``The Macronutrients: An
Overview.'' But we are not hopeless, no siree. We love broccoli. We
love salmon. Unfortunately, we have learned from Weil that not all
salmon are equal, that we need to worry not only about our own
diets but about the diets of the fish we eat, which is one step
further down the food chain than we care to go. Eggs are another
research project. ``Eggs of chickens,'' Weil writes, ``(are) good
sources of omega-3 fatty acids if they come from free-range
chickens or chickens whose diets are supplemented with omega-3-rich
algae.'' Are we up to this task? No, but we know that Weil has made
many converts-to-wellness, so rush to the store: His new book is
out, with the author looking hale and hearty on the cover.

   &UR; ``TIGERS IN THE SNOW''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Peter Matthiessen (North Point, $27) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most of us know that the tiger is beautiful, but we also have
been raised with an unshakable idea of its fierceness, the
fearsome, predatory aggression of Shere Khan in Rudyard Kipling's
``The Jungle Book.'' But Matthiessen points out that the hunter,
Jim Corbett, in his book ``The Man-eaters of Kumaon,'' refers to
the tiger as ``a large-hearted gentleman of bottomless courage.''
That's what this book aims to give you _ a new look at the tiger,
at its history, its endangered habitats, its dwindling numbers, its
extreme vulnerability to poachers, and finally, at the efforts of
researchers and wildlife biologists to study and preserve it. The
book also conveys the quiet majesty of the animal, largely through
the author's eloquent interest and regard for it. With an
introduction and color photographs by Maurice Hornocker, tiger
expert and co-founder of the Siberian Tiger Project. Matthiessen's
fans should also look for ``The Peter Matthiessen Reader''
(Vintage, $14), in which editor McKay Jenkins assembles excerpts
from the author's books of non-fiction, including ``The Snow
Leopard'' and ``Men's Lives.'' &QL;

 By ANDREW MARSHALL  
 c.2000 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Plans are being laid for a visit by George W. Bush,
the Republican presidential candidate, to Europe ahead of this
year's election. The aim would be to help him get to know some of
the leading figures on the world stage, but also to reinforce
Bush's stature.
</P>
<P>
   The challengers in the presidential election, irascible and
independent-minded John McCain and the sleepy if smart Bill
Bradley, have now withdrawn. That leaves Republican George W. Bush,
the governor of Texas and Democrat Al Gore, vice president. Both
are mainstream, slightly dull figures with highly-polished
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   As Molly Ivins, doyenne of the Texas press put it last week:
``Oh, pooh, the fun's over.'' Or as Gail Collins put it in the New
York Times, ``Maybe it will be good for our character. It's really
superficial, you know, this desire for a chief executive with
charisma.''
</P>
<P>
   But the race between the two candidates is very close, and Bush
has lost what was a double-digit margin in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is slightly ahead, according to the latest opinion polls.
At 43 percent to 40 percent, according to NBC and the Wall Street
Journal, the gap is within the polls' margin of error; but the
trend is clear.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has a potentially more serious problem: he is simply not
seen as presidential material by many people. When voters were
asked about ``the right experience and the ability to do the job of
president,'' nearly half preferred Gore; less than a third picked
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel battle-tested and that's what a lot of people wanted to
see,'' said Bush last week. ``I think the people saw I could get
whipped and bounce back.'' But he has a broader problem of stature
which the campaign has not resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams are gearing up for the campaign now, with months to
go until the party conventions. Some time before then _ perhaps in
May _ both campaigns are considering international tours, including
visits to Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is already well-known on the international stage; for Bush,
a trip abroad is a more important venture.
</P>
<P>
   In part, it is his evident lack of knowledge of international
affairs that has hurt him. Bush is a fine man, but apparently he
thinks that Canada is run by a plate of chips and cottage cheese.
</P>
<P>
   The governor was campaigning in Michigan when a reporter
delivered the news that the Canadian prime minister, Jean Poutine,
had endorsed him. ``I'm honored,'' said Bush. ``I appreciate his
strong statement. He understands our belief in free trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, the prime minister of Canada is Jean Chretien. Poutine is
a favorite dish of the Quebecois, an unpalatable mess which few
beyond Canada care to sample.
</P>
<P>
   Ignorance of these matters is hardly crippling in itself _ few
Americans take much notice of politics up north, let alone Canadian
cuisine, and the Canadian prankster who tried it on with Bush has
had plenty of success with many other politicians.
</P>
<P>
   The point is that cheap shots at Bush's knowledge of foreign
affairs are becoming all too common.
</P>
<P>
   His uneasy relationship with spoken English does not help.
``When I was coming up, it was a dangerous world and we knew
exactly who the they were. It was us versus them, and it was clear
who them was. Today, we're not so sure who the they are. But we
know they're there,'' he said on one memorable occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is madmen in the world, and there are terror,'' he said
on another.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, by contrast, has little to worry about in terms of the
legacy of the campaign. One of his weaknesses going into the
election was that (like many vice presidents) he had come to be
seen as ineffectual, but the campaign has started to change that.
</P>
<P>
   His fight against Bradley showed him to be tough and
resourceful, even vicious at times. He will be attacked for being
part of President Bill Clinton's administration, but by contrast he
has few weaknesses when it comes to experience.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has relatively little track record in politics by
comparison. He has been governor of Texas since 1994, but the post
carries fewer responsibilities than in many other states. The
state's legislature meets only every other year; it is not an
especially arduous job.
</P>
<P>
   The real problem for Bush is that he seems lightweight. The
jokes and cartoons of him play on the image; one columnist last
week referred to the contest between the two candidates as the
pinhead versus the sleaze, meaning Gore.
</P>
<P>
   While the latter description will please Bush, the former won't.
The Democrats had hoped since last year to paint Bush as an ``Empty
Suit,'' and that view seems to be gaining ground.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, by contrast, may be no John Kennedy but he does at least
have a certain solidity.
</P>
<P>
   Bush ``whined his way through several states yearning for his
family, his dog and his own no-steam shaving mirror back home,''
says columnist Collins. ``Mr. Gore just seems to be real, real good
at enduring discomfort. In the age of indulgence, we've got a stoic
running for president.''
</P>
<P>
   There is one other question about Bush's stature. In the last
twelve presidential elections, the shorter candidate has won only
twice, in 1972 and 1976. Bush is five feet eleven inches, a little
taller in his cowboy boots. Gore is six feet one inch. Even a visit
to see Tony Blair can't change that. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN _ In the wave of half-freedoms that have followed the
recent pro-reformist elections in Iran, the dark and sinister
political role of ex-president Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani _ once
the most powerful man in the Islamic Republic _ is at last being
revealed in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   Rafsanjani, who first disclosed the Iran-Contra scandal, is
being linked to at least six senior Iranian government officials
who, during his presidency, ordered the secret execution of more
than 80 dissidents, intellectuals and criminals.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-president, it now transpires, also appointed members of
his own family to high positions in the lucrative oil ministry in
Iran.
</P>
<P>
   As the political star of Rafsanjani falls through the firmament
_ he has just failed in his attempt to become speaker of the new
parliament _ so the revelations about his 10-year presidency and
its nepotism are being uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   The names of at least seven men with whom he dealt _ some of
whom are said to have issued ``fatwas'' ordering the death of
dozens of innocent Iranians during Rafsanjani's rule _ are known in
Iran but have never been published before.
</P>
<P>
   They include Ali Fallahian, former head of intelligence; Ali
Razini, who was head of judiciary powers in Tehran _ he is now a
member of the ``special'' clergy court; and Mustafa Pourmahamadi,
the former deputy intelligence minister in charge of international
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The ``death squad'' committee also included Ruhollah Hosseinian,
who is currently head of Iran's ``documentation center''; two
ayatollahs _ said to have signed a decree ordering the murder of
``apostates'' _ and Said Emami, the ex-deputy intelligence minister
in charge of ``operational'' affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Emami was found dead _ murdered with a potassium injection _
while in prison for allegedly ordering the murders of intellectuals
during the presidency of Rafsanjani's successor, Mohamed Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   Emami's dispatch occurred only days before his trial in which he
was expected to name the high-ranking murderers. Many in Tehran
believe that Rafsanjani was himself a member of the secret
``killer'' committee.
</P>
<P>
   The murder victims include the translator and writer Saidi
Sirjani, killed by injection in 1994; Ahmed Mirallai, another
writer who was knifed to death; Ahmed Taffozoli, who died in a car
``accident''; and Ibrahim Zalzade, a journalist who was also
knifed.
</P>
<P>
   Also among the murder victims was a middle-aged woman, Fateme
Ghaemmaghami, the mother of three children who was believed to have
been involved with a member of the execution committee.
</P>
<P>
   At least three Sunni Muslim clerics were also liquidated, one of
them knifed to death in Kermanshah. An Armenian Orthodox priest was
also killed after his name appeared on the intelligence ministry
execution list.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the murders were particularly gruesome; at least one
victim is said to have been cut into pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Iranian journalists have already been asking what Rafsanjani
knew about the ``fatwas'' for the execution of intellectuals,
although the Independent is the first newspaper to print the names
of those known to be on the execution committee.
</P>
<P>
   Akbar Gangi, the most prominent investigative journalist in
Tehran, has written a book about the committee _ without giving
names _ called ``The Dungeon of Ghosts'' in which he refers to
another cleric as ``the eminence grise.''
</P>
<P>
   Gangi has already received death threats by phone and fax. ``My
friends have said to me that the only way of protecting myself is
to give an interview,'' he told the Independent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The information I have about the murders is exact and very
sensitive _ 90 to 100 people were killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally earnest if less grave questions are being asked about
Rafsanjani's family.
</P>
<P>
   His son Yasser, it is now clear, worked in the procurement
section of the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) while also
running a private company connected to NIOC. Rafsanjani's nephew,
Ali, was a deputy minister of oil while another son, Mehdi, was
employed in the national gas company, NAFT-va-GAS.
</P>
<P>
   Stories of Rafsanjani's personal wealth _ he is the son of a
pistachio farmer _ have spread throughout Iran and were one reason
for his failure to gain more than 25 percent of the vote in last
month's elections.
</P>
<P>
   He spends several weeks a year in a luxury villa north of Tehran
where gazelles graze amid parkland and hills guarded by special
security police. &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The newsroom of the Los Angeles Times seemed like
a mausoleum to reporters Monday morning, and all around town the
obituary to the century-long reign of the Chandler family was being
written with the announcement that the Times Mirror Co. had been
sold to Chicago-based Tribune Co.
</P>
<P>
   The takeover _ $6.46 billion in stock and cash plus $1.8 billion
in debt _ hit many like a California quake, realigning power and
rocking community institutions.
</P>
<P>
   From City Hall and Bunker Hill high-rises to journalistic
enclaves across the country, the reaction was one of disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan lamented the sale of ``a venerable Los
Angeles institution,'' former Times news executive Noel Greenwood
called the merger ``the final chapter of Mark Willes and the
Chandler family,'' while billionaire businessman Eli Broad
expressed dismay that Los Angeles would become the largest U.S.
city not to have a locally owned major daily newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I'd see the day that the Los Angeles Times was
owned by anyone other than the Chandlers or some other local
interests,'' Broad said. ``I hope the Chicago Tribune people are
smart enough to put their executives out here so they can learn
about Los Angeles and represent it and not try to run it from
Chicago.''
</P>
<P>
   Otis Chandler, the former publisher who is credited with
building the Los Angeles Times into a respected national newspaper,
told the Times in today's editions that he didn't know about the
deal until late Sunday night, after it was approved. He said he
began hearing possible rumors Friday of a takeover by The Tribune
Co., but said he made no effort to confirm the rumors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't surprised by the announcement,'' Chandler said,
``because I was not happy with current management of the Times and
Times Mirror, and my assumption was the board of directors and the
family weren't happy either, and under those circumstances, to move
forward in this mega-merger world, one has to consider merging.''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with staff fears of loss of jobs and local control, Times
executives offered assurances but few answers in staff meetings.
</P>
<P>
   However, John Madigan, chairman, president and chief executive
of Tribune Co., promised that the merger will be good for Los
Angeles and for journalism and that ``no layoffs are planned.''
</P>
<P>
   But he noted in a Reuters news service interview, ``We have not
been inside the doors of the Times Mirror properties yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we will get along fine. Our cultures are compatible.
This is the biggest thing we have ever done. ... This positions us
in the major markets as probably the leading media company.''
</P>
<P>
   County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky said if the sale is
consummated after a 20-day open bidding period and gets federal
antitrust approval, it will mean ``the passing of an era in terms
of corporate citizenship.''
</P>
<P>
   While the 1.1 million-circulation Times will certainly remain a
major paper, Yaroslavsky said it is troubling and symptomatic of
modern Los Angeles that another major corporation is leaving.
</P>
<P>
   With BP Amoco's pending acquisition of Atlantic Richfield Co.,
Times Mirror is the ``last domino'' in long list of Fortune 500
companies to leave downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be if you wanted to build Disney Hall, you went to
15 or 20 corporations, got them energized and got the job done,''
Yaroslavsky said. ``But those companies don't exist here anymore,
they aren't locally rooted and we suffer to a significant degree as
a result.''
</P>
<P>
   By agreeing to sell the Times and the company's other papers and
enterprises, through its controlling stock interests and out of its
own trust, the Chandler family is ending 118 years of ownership and
control.
</P>
<P>
   For good and ill, the Chandlers stamped their journalistic, real
estate, cultural and philanthropic image on the region as no other
Southern California dynasty has before or after. Often accused of
unprincipled boosterism and greed, the Chandlers left a legacy that
includes the Owens Valley aqueduct, development of the San Fernando
Valley and the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``If not for the Chandlers, there would not be the city of Los
Angeles as we know it,'' said Patt Morrison, a Times columnist
known for her hats and humor. ``It would be like conceiving of the
earth without gravity.''
</P>
<P>
   Morrison said her morning trip to the dentist was less painful
than the newsroom Monday.
</P>
<P>
   One senior staffer said the announcement was greeted with the
kind of sentimentality and sadness reserved for the passing of
great icons: ``There is sadness in the sense that people here are
part of a grander cultural institution, and it's sad to see that
change. It is sad to see a change in the sense of place and sense
of history that the Times and Times Mirror have had. There's a lot
of confusion and uncertainty.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Willes, the controversial chairman and CEO of Times Mirror,
reportedly burst into tears and wept as he left the board meeting
Sunday night after the deal was approved.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he told employees he will leave within 90 to 180
days, when the merger is completed.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN _ In the wave of half-freedoms that have followed the
recent pro-reformist elections in Iran, the dark and sinister
political role of ex-president Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani _ once
the most powerful man in the Islamic Republic _ is at last being
revealed in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   Rafsanjani, who first disclosed the Iran-Contra scandal, is
being linked to at least six senior Iranian government officials
who, during his presidency, ordered the secret execution of more
than 80 dissidents, intellectuals and criminals.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-president, it now transpires, also appointed members of
his own family to high positions in the lucrative oil ministry in
Iran.
</P>
<P>
   As the political star of Rafsanjani falls through the firmament
_ he has just failed in his attempt to become speaker of the new
parliament _ so the revelations about his 10-year presidency and
its nepotism are being uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   The names of at least seven men with whom he dealt _ some of
whom are said to have issued ``fatwas'' ordering the death of
dozens of innocent Iranians during Rafsanjani's rule _ are known in
Iran but have never been published before.
</P>
<P>
   They include Ali Fallahian, former head of intelligence; Ali
Razini, who was head of judiciary powers in Tehran _ he is now a
member of the ``special'' clergy court; and Mustafa Pourmahamadi,
the former deputy intelligence minister in charge of international
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The ``death squad'' committee also included Ruhollah Hosseinian,
who is currently head of Iran's ``documentation center''; two
ayatollahs _ said to have signed a decree ordering the murder of
``apostates'' _ and Said Emami, the ex-deputy intelligence minister
in charge of ``operational'' affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Emami was found dead _ murdered with a potassium injection _
while in prison for allegedly ordering the murders of intellectuals
during the presidency of Rafsanjani's successor, Mohamed Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   Emami's dispatch occurred only days before his trial in which he
was expected to name the high-ranking murderers. Many in Tehran
believe that Rafsanjani was himself a member of the secret
``killer'' committee.
</P>
<P>
   The murder victims include the translator and writer Saidi
Sirjani, killed by injection in 1994; Ahmed Mirallai, another
writer who was knifed to death; Ahmed Taffozoli, who died in a car
``accident''; and Ibrahim Zalzade, a journalist who was also
knifed.
</P>
<P>
   Also among the murder victims was a middle-aged woman, Fateme
Ghaemmaghami, the mother of three children who was believed to have
been involved with a member of the execution committee.
</P>
<P>
   At least three Sunni Muslim clerics were also liquidated, one of
them knifed to death in Kermanshah. An Armenian Orthodox priest was
also killed after his name appeared on the intelligence ministry
execution list.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the murders were particularly gruesome; at least one
victim is said to have been cut into pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Iranian journalists have already been asking what Rafsanjani
knew about the ``fatwas'' for the execution of intellectuals,
although the Independent is the first newspaper to print the names
of those known to be on the execution committee.
</P>
<P>
   Akbar Gangi, the most prominent investigative journalist in
Tehran, has written a book about the committee _ without giving
names _ called ``The Dungeon of Ghosts'' in which he refers to
another cleric as ``the eminence grise.''
</P>
<P>
   Gangi has already received death threats by phone and fax. ``My
friends have said to me that the only way of protecting myself is
to give an interview,'' he told the Independent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The information I have about the murders is exact and very
sensitive _ 90 to 100 people were killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally earnest if less grave questions are being asked about
Rafsanjani's family.
</P>
<P>
   His son Yasser, it is now clear, worked in the procurement
section of the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) while also
running a private company connected to NIOC. Rafsanjani's nephew,
Ali, was a deputy minister of oil while another son, Mehdi, was
employed in the national gas company, NAFT-va-GAS.
</P>
<P>
   Stories of Rafsanjani's personal wealth _ he is the son of a
pistachio farmer _ have spread throughout Iran and were one reason
for his failure to gain more than 25 percent of the vote in last
month's elections.
</P>
<P>
   He spends several weeks a year in a luxury villa north of Tehran
where gazelles graze amid parkland and hills guarded by special
security police. &QL;

MARINO RETIRES WITH 25 NFL RECORDS, BUT NO RING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seventeen was enough for Miami Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino.
</P>
<P>
   Despite having never won a Super Bowl, the NFL's all-time
leading passer passed on a chance to return for an 18th season.
Marino made his retirement official Monday, four days after
reaching the decision during a family meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to miss it,'' Marino said, pausing to compose
himself. ``I'm going to miss everything about it. I'm going to miss
the relationships with the players. I'm going to miss the fans. I'm
going to miss the great friends I've made over this time. I'm going
to miss all the good times we've had together. Most of all, I'm
going to miss Sunday afternoons.''
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota Vikings had offered Marino a one-year contract and
a starting job. Instead, he opted to retire with the team that
drafted him 27th in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins owner Wayne Huizenga announced that the team will honor
Marino by retiring his No. 13, placing a statue of him outside Pro
Player Stadium and naming a street for him.
</P>
<P>
   Marino said loyalty to the Dolphins, his unwillingness to be
separated from his wife and five children and health concerns were
factors in his decision.
</P>
<P>
   Marino, who turns 39 in September, has endured 291 sacks and
eight operations in his career. Last season he missed five games
with a neck injury, which affected his arm strength when he
returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, I really struggled with this,'' Marino said. ``This has
been the toughest month of my life as far as dealing with playing
football or retiring. After the season, I pretty much thought that
I was not going to play anymore, and I felt that way for a while. I
think it was because of the physical aspects of the game. It kept
coming back to how my legs felt during last season and going
through the neck injury and not knowing whether I was going to be
able to throw the football.''
</P>
<P>
   Throwing the football is what Marino did better than anyone in
history. He leaves with 25 NFL records, including attempts (8,358),
completions (4,967), yards (61,361) and touchdowns (420), and is
tied for five others.
</P>
<P>
   But while Marino was good, he was never lucky enough to win a
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, he threw for 5,084 yards and 48 touchdowns, NFL
regular-season records that still stand, but the Dolphins lost to
the San Francisco 49ers, 38-16, in Super Bowl XIX. Miami has lost
in the AFC Championship Game twice in the 15 seasons since.
</P>
<P>
   ``That (a Super Bowl title) was the only reason really to
continue to play,'' said Marino, who was 155-103, including
playoffs, as a starter. ``That has been a dream of mine my whole
career. I'm not going to have that chance, but it does not take
away from what I've done personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Huizenga, who became the team's sole owner in 1994, hugged
Marino and apologized for the Dolphins having never won a
championship for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``But just because you didn't win a Super Bowl doesn't mean that
you're not a champion, because we all know otherwise,'' Huizenga
said.
</P>
<P>
   Marino admitted he ``sometimes wasn't happy'' during Jimmy
Johnson's four seasons as head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson retired Jan. 16, a day after the Dolphins suffered the
worst loss in team history, a 62-7 playoff defeat to the
Jacksonville Jaguars. It ended a tumultuous season for Marino and
Johnson, who had frequently criticized his quarterback for poor
decisions and costly turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Marino, who had been scheduled to make $7.5 million in 2000,
voided his contract in February and became a free agent. Then, the
Dolphins signed free- agent quarterback Jay Fiedler to a
three-year, $3.8 million contract to compete with Damon Huard for
the starting job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a sense of loss that's huge right now, because I know
I'm not going to be out there playing anymore,'' Marino said.
``...I will not play football again.'' nn

   In a statement to employees, he thanked them for making Times
Mirror a ``very valuable company.'' Under the terms of the merger,
shareholders _ including many Times employees _ will get to
exchange their Times Mirror shares at a premium rate, about twice
the $47 a share they were selling for on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are the last in a line of dedicated and extraordinary
people who made our company great,'' Willes wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Newsroom discontent with Willes and Publisher Kathryn Downing
reached a boiling point when a profit-sharing deal with Staples
Center forced the Times to defend its journalistic standards.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Weinstein, legal affairs reporter at the Times, said on
the ``Which Way L.A.'' radio program, ``I am not going to cry over
his departure after he has driven up the stock and is making
millions.''
</P>
<P>
   Downing held three staff meetings Monday, telling staff members
that the principles of editorial independence and integrity would
be maintained. The Times, she added, will be a separate subsidiary
of Tribune, with a separate board of directors, including Chandler
family members.
</P>
<P>
   She said Times Mirror's corporate structure, which includes 170
people, is redundant to the Tribune's, but did not say what would
happen to employees.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Hill, president and CEO of the Times Mirror Foundation,
said the Tribune Co. has a strong philanthropic ethic, and that she
anticipates the foundation and the Times' giving, which totaled
about $5.8 million in the L.A. area last year, will continue. The
Tribune Co.'s foundation arm contributed about $5 million in the
region last year, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many staff members said they were worried that the Times'
international and national bureaus, which were created by Otis
Chandler in the 1960s and have added to the paper's prestige, would
be absorbed by the Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the chicken eating the alligator,'' said one staff
member, who shared many staffers' view that The Times is superior
to the Chicago Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   Greenwood, a former senior editor with 25 years' experience at
the Times, said Willes ``did what he was hired to do. He made them
even more obscenely wealthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Bellows, former editor of the now-defunct Los Angeles
Herald-Examiner and a former senior editor at the Times, said,
``It's a shame how money is running everything nowadays. It used to
be that a newspaper was a quasi public service, but it depends on
the stock price now. It doesn't bode well for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   City Editor Bill Boyarsky, who's been at The Times since 1970,
said there was widespread apprehension in the newsroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is very worried,'' he said.

RANGERS' SHORTFALL WON'T BE IN ROTATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ Watching the Texas Rangers take batting
practice Monday morning, Toronto manager Jim Fregosi hinted at some
logical skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, they plan to do it this season with pitching and
defense?'' he asked. The tone of doubt was obvious, particularly
since Fregosi already knew the answer to his question.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing unusual about any of that this spring. Outside of the
Rangers' camp in the Charlotte County swamps, there's not exactly a
roll call needed of baseball types who believe this is a team that
can suddenly wean itself off the long-standing tradition of
bats-outta-hell.
</P>
<P>
   But another voice at Charlotte County Stadium Monday morning
belonged to Rangers pitching coach Dick Bosman, entering his sixth
season on the job.
</P>
<P>
   Normally scrambling for staff answers three weeks into spring
training, Bosman said something totally out of character. ``We've
been good,'' he volunteered, ``and we're going to be good.''
</P>
<P>
   Clip and save. Ironically, however, the afternoon exhibition
game with the Blue Jays added a tad of credence to Bosman's show of
optimism. Even for mid-March, the six innings worked by Kenny
Rogers were so crisp, an old-timer like Fregosi offered a verbal
tip of the cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rogers is ready for the season right now,'' Fregosi said. ``He
could have gone nine (innings) easy.
</P>
<P>
   In a 6-1 victory for the Rangers, the only thing that apparently
kept Rogers from a complete game was a 60-pitch limit in his third
Florida outing. The lefty threw 59, which for six innings is a
dominating performance of pitch location and pitching know-how.
Plus, the Toronto lineup was sprinkled with some large bats.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring's big picture, the four definite rotation members
(Rogers, Esteban Loaiza, Darren Oliver and Rick Helling) have now
given up only eight earned runs in 27 innings, and five of those
are from Helling. The leading candidate to fill in for the
rehabilitating Justin Thompson is Mark Clark, who thus far has done
a 180-degree spin from his awful 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us have been around long enough to know what happens
down here has to be tempered with caution,'' Bosman said. ``But
given continued health, what we are seeing thus far will translate
into the regular season. With these guys, it's not a guessing game.
They've all been around for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   In time, the Rangers plan on Thompson being the rotation No. 1.
That's what the Juan Gonzzlez trade was all about. But there will
be no rushing Thompson's recovery from shoulder surgery in August.
Him being ready by the first of May is the ``cautious'' timetable.
</P>
<P>
   But it is interesting that Rogers almost immediately became the
No. 1 while Thompson is out. Manager Johnny Oates hasn't named him
the Opening Day starter, but Oates did set up his Florida rotation
that way. That probably says more about Helling's erratic 1999
season than anything Rogers has accomplished in a long major-league
career that came full circle when free-agent Rogers re-signed with
the Rangers this winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Kenny's attitude and approach,'' said Bosman, before
Rogers' performance against the Blue Jays. ``I just think he's
wiser and smarter for the places he's been and what he's had to
endure. I see that, and I've been struck by it.''
</P>
<P>
   When last spotted in October, Rogers was walking home the
winning run in Game 6 of the National League Championship Series.
The Braves went to the World Series. The Mets didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who knew me when I was with the Rangers before probably
thought I'd come in here this spring full of anger,'' said Rogers,
smiling. ``Not that something like that doesn't nick your
confidence a bit, but you learn to deal with stuff. I've never been
afraid of failing, but what I've had to learn is how to become
stronger when I do fail.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a challenge-em-with-the-fastball kind of pitcher, the
35-year-old Rogers now almost refers to himself as a junk-baller.
``There are going to be people see me pitch and wonder how does he
get anybody out with that stuff,'' he said after Monday's outing.
``But when I had the good fastball, I wish I'd have known then what
I know now. You don't have to overpower hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fregosi was looking at it from the other dugout Monday.
``Kenny has become a pitcher, and it's hard for a guy who used to
throw as hard as he did to make the transition,'' Fregosi said. ``I
give him credit for that. Frank Tanana is one of the few who made
that transition. Kenny will eat up a lot of innings this season.''
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of Bosman, the Rogers fastball has also returned
this spring and was evident Monday with six strikeouts. The
velocity isn't the same, but as a surprise pitch on the inside
corner ... well, that's called pitching.
</P>
<P>
   And a lot of people still have to be convinced the Rangers have
enough of it. nn

KINGS TRADE AUDETTE, KABERLE TO ATLANTA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Donald Audette, who lost his spot on the second
line because of injuries and inconsistency, wanted a trade and got
one Monday when the Kings sent him and minor leaguer Frantisek
Kaberle to Atlanta for power forward Kelly Buchberger and winger
Nelson Emerson.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings had been trying to move Audette since mid-season and
had few takers. He had come from Buffalo last season after missing
half a season in a contract dispute. Audette has scored at least 24
goals five times in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Audette, who scored just one goal in 11 games since returning
from a badly sprained left ankle, had requested the club trade him
after his ice time began to dwindle. In 49 games this season,
Audette had 12 goals and 32 points.
</P>
<P>
   Audette, who scored 19 goals in 51 games last year after being
acquired in midseason from Buffalo for an eighth-round pick, was
scratched from Monday's game against Vancouver. It was his third
healthy scratch in the last five games.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Audette, 30, played right wing on the first line.
But when the club traded for Ziggy Palffy in July, Audette's time
with the Kings appeared in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   New coach Andy Murray moved Audette to left wing on the second
line, pairing him with center Bryan Smolinski and right winger Glen
Murray.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got Ziggy, I knew I wanted him and Glen as the
right-wings on my first two lines,'' Murray said. ``I thought if
Donald worked hard, he might become a solid player on the checking
line. But that can be a difficult transition.
</P>
<P>
   Audette was eligible for unrestricted free agency at the end of
the season and wasn't expected back. He is earning $2.3 million
this year, steep for a third-line player. If the Kings had
attempted to retain his rights, Audette would have earned an
automatic 10-percent raise.
</P>
<P>
   Kaberle, 26, opened the season in a regular rotation on the
Kings power play. But he wore down in January and was sent to
minor-league Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   In 37 games, Kaberle had no goals and nine assists.
</P>
<P>
   QUICK WHISTLES: Emerson is a close friend of Kings captain Rob
Blake from their college days at Bowling Green. Emerson has 14
goals and 33 points but is a minus-24, which is common on an
expansion team....
</P>
<P>
   Enforcer Steve McKenna, a healthy scratch the last nine games,
played Monday night and received a five-minute fighting penalty
midway through the first period for mixing it up with Vancouver's
Brad May.
</P>
<P>
   For McKenna, it was an important game. He has played 38 games
this season and needs 40 for the Kings to protect him in this
summer's expansion draft. The Kings want McKenna to play in Europe
this summer to sharpen his skills beyond fighting. He has no goals
and four assists this season. &QL;

COWBOYS RETAIN TEAGUE WITH FOUR-YEAR DEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Dallas Cowboys took another step in their
deliberate approach to free agency Monday by re-signing free safety
George Teague to a four-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   Financial terms of the agreement were not announced. However, a
source said it's a salary-cap friendly contract _ roughly $650,000
against the cap in 2000 _ that is consistent with Cowboys owner
Jerry Jones' new-found philosophy of incentive-laden deals with
modest up-front bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys vice president Stephen Jones said the team made Teague a
priority not just because they like the experienced he brings to
the defense and the leadership he provides in the secondary but
also because they feel the seven-year veteran was the best safety
on market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted Teague back,'' Jones said. ``He made a lot of big
plays for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Teague played with the Cowboys in 1996 before going to Miami as
a free agent. He came back to Dallas in 1998 and has started
alongside strong safety Darren Woodson the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   He has said that he preferred to remain in Dallas and is coming
off a solid 1999 season, when he finished fourth on the team in
tackles with a career-high 102. He also intercepted three passes,
returning two for touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Getting Teague back was one of the team's few stated off-season
objectives. The Cowboys achieved two of their goals last month when
they acquired receiver Joey Galloway and signed a veteran
cornerback (Ryan McNeil) to replace the soon-to-be-departed Deion
Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   The main objectives left on their free-agent agenda include
re-signing defensive tackle Alonzo Spellman and getting a backup
quarterback to replace Jason Garrett (New York Giants).
</P>
<P>
   They will likely now turn their attention to Spellman, who made
a free-agent visit to Green Bay Packers last week. Spellman has
said he wants to return to the Cowboys, but he is not ruling out
leaving.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are also in the market for moderately priced players
at inside linebacker and tight end. They have expressed interest in
Tennessee free-agent tight end Jackie Harris but have yet to extend
an offer. COWBOYS ON TELEVISION IN PRESEASON
</P>
<P>
   The NFL released its 2000 preseason national television
schedule, and the Cowboys will be featured in two of the league's
11 nationally televised games.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 5, ESPN will televise the American Bowl in Tokyo, Japan,
which will match the Cowboys against the Atlanta Falcons. ESPN will
also carry the Cowboys' home game against the Super Bowl champion
St. Louis Rams on Aug. 24. The rest of the preseason schedule will
be announced at a later date. BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ The Cowboys signed Brandon Tolbert, an exclusive-rights free
agent, to a one-year deal Monday. Tolbert, a linebacker, spent the
1999 season on injured reserve.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Cowboys are expected to sign free-agent receiver Connie
Moore to a one-year deal Tuesday. nn

L.A. TIMES LATEST HQ TO LEAVE DOWNTOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JASON TAKENOUCHI 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The pending sale of Times Mirror Co. to the
Chicago-based Tribune Co. would strip downtown Los Angeles of one
of its last two major corporate headquarters, underscoring the
Greater San Fernando Valley's emergence as the region's business
capital.
</P>
<P>
   The Times Mirror sale would leave Atlantic Richfield Co. _
itself waiting for approval of a merger with London-based BP Amoco
_ the last Fortune 500 company to call downtown home after the
departure of many corporations and all the banks.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, three corporations on last year's Fortune 500 list
call the Greater San Fernando Valley home _ Foundation Health
Systems and Litton Industries in Woodland Hills and the Walt Disney
Co. in Burbank.
</P>
<P>
   A few other Valley-based firms _ including Sylmar's MiniMed and
Chatsworth's MRV Communications _ have market capitalization about
the same as Times Mirror's, emphasizing the growing importance of
the Valley to the city's economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Valley is quite well positioned with all these corporate
headquarters, and the challenge is to keep them,'' said Jack Kyser,
chief economist with the nonprofit Los Angeles Economic Development
Corp. ``You have to go out and treasure your corporate
headquarters.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of some of the Valley's largest companies said the key
to keeping them here is their employees.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping workers close to work _ and thus more likely to stay
with the firm _ played a significant role in Unova Inc.'s decision
last year to relocate its headquarters from Beverly Hills to
Woodland Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes more sense to stay in the area where the majority of
your good people are,'' said David Brooks, manager of corporate
public relations for the $2.1 billion manufacturer of automatic
identification systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an attractive area to live and work, and we wanted to
keep our team here.''
</P>
<P>
   Unova is far from the only company that has chosen to stay in
the San Fernando Valley to keep its best employees.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Gregg, president of the medical device maker MiniMed Inc.,
said his company turned down offers to move to other cities _ and
even other states _ when it decided to move its headquarters from
Sylmar to Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to stay in the Valley was prompted by a number of
factors, including a first-of-its-kind deal with California State
University, Northridge, which owns the 30-plus-acre site of
MiniMed's future headquarters. But keeping the company's work force
was another major factor, Gregg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a well-trained, educated labor pool that would be
difficult to replace at another locale. We've spent a lot of money
educating the employees.''
</P>
<P>
   San Fernando Valley business leaders say the area's work force
should keep major companies' headquarters here.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the labor pool is here, this will always be an
attractive place for businesses,'' said Bonny Herman, longtime
president of the Valley Industry and Commerce Association.
</P>
<P>
   Herman said there could be problems on the horizon, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government should but can't figure out how to deal with the
aging industrial stock or build enough affordable housing.''
</P>
<P>
   But those issues might not be enough to discourage the firms
that already call the Valley home.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always look for a combination of factors, and the Valley
seems to have it,'' said David Olson, senior vice president of
investor relations for Woodland Hills-based Foundation Health
Systems Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a wonderful experience here. I don't think there's
any sign that we're going to be moving.''

EVANS SHOWS RANGERS HIS DEFENSIVE SKILLS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ The Rangers' third-base competition
heated up a little more Monday. Tom Evans had another terrific day,
this time on defense.
</P>
<P>
   Evans made three diving backhanded stops to get outs on ground
balls down the line in the Rangers' 6-1 victory against the Toronto
Blue Jays at Charlotte County Stadium. Evans, who is competing with
Mike Lamb, also made a nice barehanded play on a slow chopper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny,'' Evans said. ``Sometimes you can go three games
and get maybe one ball, or no balls. Then sometimes you get into a
game where you get a chance to make plays like that.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't lost on Evans that the plays were made in front of the
Blue Jays, the team that put him on waivers last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun,'' Evans said, smiling. ``There are still a few guys
over there who are my friends.''
</P>
<P>
   More important is what manager Johnny Oates thinks, and he was
beaming after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know exactly what I've got at third base, but I like
what I've seen,'' Oates said. ``(Evans) made some very nice plays
over there, very nice.'' DAVIS EMERGING
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Doug Davis, one of the Rangers' top minor-league
starting pitchers, has emerged as a possible replacement for Mike
Venafro in the Rangers' Opening Day bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Davis pitched a scoreless ninth inning Monday and has allowed
only one earned run in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a gut feeling, but I think Doug Davis is ready to
pitch in the big leagues,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Venafro is sidelined with a strained ligament in his left middle
finger, and the Rangers aren't sure if he'll be ready Opening Day.
Oates likes at least two left-handers in the bullpen and the top
three behind Venafro are Mike Mu$oz, Matt Perisho and Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has 69 starts and four relief appearances in the minors
but said, ``Anyway I can get to the major leagues the fastest is
what I want to do.'' PORT CHARLOTTE MEETING
</P>
<P>
   Rangers executive vice president John McMichael is scheduled to
meet with Charlotte County officials Wednesday morning about the
Rangers' spring-training lease, which expires at the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, who have formed an unofficial partnership with the
Los Angeles Dodgers, are exploring Las Vegas, Arizona and Vero
Beach, Fla. But general manager Doug Melvin likes Port Charlotte,
and the Rangers aren't ruling out extending the lease.
</P>
<P>
   That could be made possible by a bill pending in the Florida
legislature that would provide state funds to upgrade
spring-training facilities. The Rangers have made it clear their
facility needs improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a plus for Charlotte to have those kind of revenue
streams,'' McMichael said. ``We're interested in hearing more about
it.'' ANOTHER TRY FOR DIAZ
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Diaz, Cuban defector and second-base hopeful for the
Rangers, spent Monday at the American consulate in the Dominican
Republic, resubmitting his visa application.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, who signed Diaz on Feb. 28, were hoping to have him
in camp by now, but visa problems have forced him to remain in the
Dominican Republic. Rangers scouting director Chuck McMichael said
if the visa situation isn't cleared up soon, Diaz won't get a
chance to showcase his talent in major-league camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we go to Plan E,'' McMichael said. BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Left fielder Rusty Greer underwent tests on his injured right
ankle in Dallas on Monday, but the Rangers aren't expecting the
results until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Rangers sent 11 players back to the minor-league camp,
including three first-round draft picks: pitchers Jonathan Johnson
(1995) and R.A. Dickey (1996), and first baseman Carlos Pe$a
(1998). Also sent back were pitchers David Elder, Corey Lee, Juan
Moreno and Matt Miller, catchers Reed Secrist and Luis Taveras,
infielder Jason Grabowski and outfielder Pedro Valdes. nn

WHEN PLAYERS CAN'T MAKE CUT, THERE'S OFTEN A FINE LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ariz. _ A ritual as familiar here as sunburn was done
Monday at Mariners spring training: roster cuts.
</P>
<P>
   No departures were unexpected. Or explained. Or grieved.
</P>
<P>
   But when elite athletes appear to be hitting and pitching as
well as the established pros, what is the baseball cleaver that can
separate major-leaguer from top minor-leaguer?
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at speed, arm, defensive ability, athleticism,
hustle, attitude, and there's no difference between the
major-leaguers and these guys (just cut),'' said manager Lou
Piniella of the position player trim. ``But you break them down
offensively, they don't hit certain pitches as well as
major-leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why they're at Triple-A. They have holes.''
</P>
<P>
   In the baseball lexicon, a hole is a place in the swing where
batters do poorly. Many hitters who put up big numbers in the minor
leagues don't know they have holes until they reach major league
spring training, or get a seasonal callup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up here, you have advance scouts and a great video system,''
Piniella said. ``When a guy hurts you with the bat, you pay
attention to him. You find how he hits against four or five
different pitchers. If the guy has holes, they will be found.''
</P>
<P>
   That's primarily why five solid, young outfielders were sent
down to the minors Monday _ Shane Monahan, Chad Alexander, Rich
Butler, Mike Murphy and Mike Neill.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few of the hitters we sent out, their strengths were hitting
the ball down and in,'' Piniella said. ``For example, if you're a
left-handed hitter in the majors, the first thing the opposing
manager, pitching coach and advance scout will tell the pitcher is,
`Don't throw the ball down and in to a left-handed hitter.'
</P>
<P>
   ``For a good major league hitter, the down-and-in zone might be
a .400 average for them. The down-and-away or up-and-away might be
.250, .260. But in the guys we cut, those zones drop off the
charts.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what separates Dan Rohrmeier from, say, John Olerud _ two
big, strong, veteran first basemen, one a batting champion, one a
career minor-leaguer.
</P>
<P>
   For 11 seasons, Rohrmeier tore up the minors. In 1997 in Class
AAA Tacoma, he was the Mariners' minor league player of the year.
He broke long-held team records in doubles, home runs and RBIs.
During his career in the minors, he had 152 home runs and 770 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   His major league career stats? Three hits in nine at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   He's now playing in South Korea's top league, where at 34 last
year he hit 45 home runs, won the triple crown and made more than
$400,000.
</P>
<P>
   Rohrmeier is among the vast majority of pro baseball players who
can do well right up to the point where, as Roger Jongewaard, vice
president of scouting, put it, ``they can't adjust their own
weaknesses to major league pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   As a player, Piniella knew the problem, having spent six years
in the minors before getting the hang of hitting at 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to redo myself and learn to cover up my holes,'' he
said. ``I had to learn to hit to all fields and cut down on my
strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most hitters, there's a flaw in plate coverage, or in the
stance, and they have to figure those things out. A hitting coach
can't do it for them.''
</P>
<P>
   In pitching, two assets separate the talents into major league
and minor league, according to Mariners pitching coach Bryan Price:
consistent delivery and ownership of an out pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Major league pitchers don't pitch out of character and don't
get away from their strengths,'' he said. ``They don't back down,
don't give the hitters too much credit.''
</P>
<P>
   The out pitch is one a pitcher throws when a hitter knows it's
coming, and still flails like a three-armed octopus.
</P>
<P>
   The best pitchers have more than one that can fetch that
precious strike. Freddy Garcia has a fastball, curve and changeup.
Gil Meche has a fastball, slider and change. Newcomer Kevin Hodges
has a power sinker drawing raves, and Kazu Sasaki has a forkball
that hitters haplessly pound into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Moyer? Any pitch, any time, for a strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' Price said, ``is special.''
</P>
<P>
   Roster cuts also have much to do with the personnel load at the
major league level. In the outfield, for example, the Mariners,
after cuts, have six with chubby guaranteed contracts, and are
still looking for help.
</P>
<P>
   When the major league chance does come, still more can't handle
the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``A solid prospect can go to Triple-A and put up good numbers
and hit a comfort zone,'' bench coach John McLaren said.
``Sometimes when they get the major league opportunity, they put
extra pressure on themselves, then they have a couple bad at-bats,
and believe they can't handle it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opportunity doesn't knock often, and some guys just aren't
ready.''
</P>
<P>
   At the elite level, baseball is a game of sufficient difficulty
that it is fairly remarkable anybody can play it well.
</P>
<P>
   Those who do, earn millions. Those who don't, are minor legends
in Tacoma and Seoul.

L.A. SCHOOL PLAN TO CREATE MINIDISTRICTS, CUT BUREAUCRACY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID R. BAKER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Declaring Los Angeles' troubled school system must
change or collapse, interim Superintendent Ramon C. Cortines
unveiled detailed plans Monday to cut 834 administrative jobs and
carve the district into 11 semi- independent pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the minidistricts, three of which would be created in
the San Fernando Valley, would have its own superintendent and
13-member appointed advisory council of parents and community
members. Each local district would make literacy its primary focus
and each would have substantial authority over its own budget.
</P>
<P>
   Cortines said the changes would give parents and individual
schools more power over education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents will have more access to where the action is,'' he
said. ``And also, we as educators will not be able to escape our
clients.''
</P>
<P>
   Cortines said the changes, expected to save the district about
$46 million a year, were necessary to eliminate the bureaucracy and
political agendas he said have hampered teaching and learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The adults in this district have failed the children in this
district,'' Cortines said. ``Our children are not dumb.''
</P>
<P>
   Cortines will formally present the reorganization plan to the
school board today. If board members approve, the changes would
take effect July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Although a vote on the plan isn't scheduled until April 11,
several board members on Monday called it a necessary step to save
the beleaguered school system.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of comprehensive overhaul the district
needs,'' board member Caprice Young said.
</P>
<P>
   Several district officials also hoped the dramatic changes would
stave off efforts to break up the 711,000-student district
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping the fact that we have a reform-minded school board
and leadership willing to take action will drive people to say,
Let's give this a chance,'' board member Valerie Fields said. ``If
it doesn't, then maybe we'll need more draconian steps.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal did not win over all the district's critics.
</P>
<P>
   San Fernando Valley businessman Bert Boeckmann, who is
spearheading a drive to break up the school district, said the
reorganization plan would not dissuade him. The Los Angeles Unified
School District, he said, is too immense and set in its ways to
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling would be they're trying to step in the right
direction,'' he said. ``I just don't think they'll arrive there.''
</P>
<P>
   School board member David Tokofsky warned that unless strictly
monitored, the creation of 11 local districts could produce more
bureaucracy _ not less.
</P>
<P>
   Gerardo Guzman, president of the San Fernando Valley Mexican
American Political Association, said the plan did little to change
basic conditions in schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're playing musical chairs,'' he said. ``They're not
putting more books in the classrooms. They're not opening more
bathrooms.''
</P>
<P>
   Guzman also said the minidistrict covering the Northeast Valley
was too large. It would serve 77,000 students _ the most of any
subdistrict. Cortines said the plan allows for reconfiguring the
districts after four or five years.
</P>
<P>
   The new Los Angeles Unified that Cortines envisions would be
leaner and looser than the current organization.
</P>
<P>
   The number of administrators working in the central offices
would be cut nearly in half. Some departments would dissolve _
their responsibilities taken up by the new minidistricts
</P>
<P>
   while others would be reshaped.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the resonsibility for student achievement would rest in
the 11 minidistricts. The 11 local superintendents, however, would
still report to a downtown superintendent and school board with
authority over the entire system.
</P>
<P>
   What remains of the district's downtown headquarters would focus
on providing ``tactical support'' to assist the efforts of
individual schools. The renamed Central Support System also would
handle policy questions as well as retain control over building
schools and policing existing campuses.
</P>
<P>
   The changes outlined Monday also include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Cutting 333 jobs from the central administration. Cortines
said he hopes to avoid layoffs, instead eliminating positions
through retirements or perhaps early retirement incentive packages.
</P>
<P>
   _ Moving 501 jobs from the district's downtown headquarters to
the minidistricts. Many of these jobs would cover functions now
handled downtown, such as business and food services.
</P>
<P>
   _ Forming advisory committees to help govern each district. Each
13-member panel would include at least eight parents, one high
school student and local business and community leaders. Each local
superintendent also would be allowed to appoint up to six
ex-officio members, including teachers and administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Should the board approve the plan, administrators would need to
apply for new jobs within the new organizational structure.
</P>
<P>
   Some district officials privately expressed relief Monday that
the district might have an opportunity to purge itself of
unproductive bureaucrats. Some department heads were unable to tell
Cortines precisely how many employees they had.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   But the process will not be easy. Many administrators have
rights to other jobs they can fill if their current positions are
cut _ rights spelled out in their contracts. Some might choose, for
instance, to become school principals.
</P>
<P>
   Cortines said he hopes to work out a way that such
administrators will be able to exercise their ``bumping rights''
without disrupting schools that either are successful or improving.
</P>
<P>
   Such uncertainty made for a nervous atmosphere in the district's
headquarters Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always some level of anxiety. Change isn't easy for a
lot of people,'' said Dan Isaacs, assistant superintendent of
school operations, who expects his office to be split up and its
responsibilities divided among the new, local districts. He said he
hadn't decided which position to apply for if the reorganization is
approved. In the meantime, he and his staff will continue their
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do your job,'' Isaacs said. ``I've been here too long not
to.''

RED FIRE ANT FOUND IN L.A.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A red fire ant has been discovered in a San
Fernando Valley garden, marking the first appearance of these
potentially deadly pests in the city, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The lone ant was found Jan. 18 in suburban Van Nuys, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an extremely serious problem,'' Agricultural
Commissioner Cato Fiksdal said. ``The ants swarm in the hundreds,
and each of those stings is reported to be extremely painful and
cause blisters.''
</P>
<P>
   County agricultural officials did not find any more at the home,
but they warned that more could appear later, said Richard Iizuka,
deputy agricultural commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   County officials speculate that common Argentinean ants at
nearby mounds may have killed off a small population of red
imported fire ants, but they won't know for sure until the
temperatures warm up and ants start coming out of their mounds
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is the possibility we'll find other fire ants when we go
back,'' said Daniel Papilli, a county agricultural inspector.
</P>
<P>
   The county Board of Supervisors is expected to vote today
whether to approve spending $627,000 to hire six workers to kill
the pests, which sting and can be deadly.
</P>
<P>
   The insect entered the Southern United States in the 1920s and
has since spread to 11 Southeastern states. Its first California
appearance was in 1997 at San Joaquin Valley orchards, making its
way to Orange County in October 1998 and Los Angeles County in
Azusa last March.
</P>
<P>
   County agricultural officials are fighting the fire ants at 172
locations in the county, including in Arcadia, Azusa, Cerritos, La
Mirada, La Verne, Pico Rivera, Rosemead, South El Monte, Torrance,
Walnut, West Covina and Whittier.
</P>
<P>
   Fire ants were blamed for the recent deaths of two elderly
people in a Mississippi nursing home, and they attacked a baby in
Arcadia in September.
</P>
<P>
   The dark red ants build gopher-like mounds 18 inches or higher
and aggressively defend the area.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next five years, the county plans to use two types of
insecticides to kill the ants, both considered harmless to people
unless eaten in large quantities.
</P>
<P>
   Agricultural officials encourage those who believe they have red
imported fire ants at their homes to call the pest hotline at (800)
491-1899 or visit the state Web site at www.cdfa.ca.gov.

PAYTON'S 40-POINT EFFORT STYMIES GRIZZLIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, B.C. _ Fighting for better playoff position, Gary
Payton and the rest of the Sonics are doing their best to
compensate for an injured Vin Baker.
</P>
<P>
   There was an emotional loss at home Sunday to the Toronto
Raptors.
</P>
<P>
   But forgive Payton for interrupting the stretch run of this
regular season with a different motivation.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics' high-strung point guard never needs to be aroused on
a basketball court, although a newspaper ad that read: ``Come see
Bibby turn the Glove inside out'' did just that.
</P>
<P>
   Payton scored 40 points and handed out 11 assists Monday night
as the Sonics dispatched Mike Bibby and the Vancouver Grizzlies
113-103 at General Motors Place.
</P>
<P>
   ``All he did was light a fire,'' Payton said, referring to a
local radio personality who showed him the promotion at the team's
practice Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy thought he was having fun by showing it to me. So I
said I'm going to make it funny for everybody in Vancouver. I don't
have anything against (Mike) Bibby. It was just the ad.''
</P>
<P>
   The advertisement touting the game ran in both local newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, Payton helped to send Vancouver to its ninth
straight loss. The Sonics, meanwhile, rebounded nicely from a 99-97
loss to Toronto in which Payton was harassed so much by double
teams that he shot a dismal 8-for-23 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   He made 14 of 27 shots and 12 of 15 free throws against the
Grizzlies, finishing just one shy of the career-high 41 points he
set earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the guy who showed him the paper that I want to have a
word with,'' Vancouver coach Lionel Hollins said. ``Gary Payton was
a monster. He was the difference. He accounted for most of their
offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton exploded for 15 points in a decisive third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The score was tied 60-60 when the Sonics ran away from the
Grizzlies with a 21-4 run. Brent Barry's 3-pointer ignited the
spurt. Payton then scored 11 points, most of which came via layups
off turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Payton's three-point play with 4:07 left in the period put the
Sonics ahead 81-64. They took a 92-80 lead into the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver got back within 102-98 with 4:07 left in the game
after forward Shareef Abdur-Rahim got hot.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Sonics scored the next six points. After Payton
made two free throws, he found Horace Grant wide open under the
basket for a layup, and Rashard Lewis hit a short jumper in the
lane.
</P>
<P>
   That mini-barrage put the Sonics ahead by 10 points and sealed
the win with 1:45 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics (39-26) moved back in front of idle Minnesota for
sixth place in the Western Conference playoff standings, with their
next seven games at home in KeyArena. Vancouver is in town on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't wake a sleeping dog,'' Barry said. ``But seriously,
I think (Payton) was more motivated because he didn't play his best
game on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker remained in street clothes for the second consecutive game
because of a strained left hamstring. Jelani McCoy started in his
place.
</P>
<P>
   Sonics coach Paul Westphal favored the same small lineup he used
against the Raptors and it was effective. Lewis and Ruben Patterson
played together with Payton, Barry and Grant down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson had 15 points and eight rebounds, while Grant finished
with 13 points and 11 boards. The Sonics forced 18 turnovers and
shut down Vancouver center Bryant ``Big Country'' Reeves in the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves scored 25 of his team-high 31 points in the first two
quarters and tied a club record with eight field goals in the
opening period. He eventually sank 11 consecutive shots, another
club record, before missing an 8-footer over Grant's outstretched
arms just before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Reeves' showing, the Sonics led 60-58 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Big Country was Shaq for awhile,'' Westphal said.
``He came back down to earth in the second half, and our defense
kicked in the third quarter and let us get a little bit of a
margin. Then Gary pretty much took care of the rest. We got good
performances from a lot of people, but Gary was unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had fun with it,'' Payton said. ``I don't worry about people
stopping me because they have to come out and stop me.''

HOUSING DEMAND IN SAN FERNANDO VALLEY KEEPS SIZZLING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREGORY J. WILCOX 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ Sales of single-family homes in the San Fernando
Valley jumped 12.1 percent during February despite the 36th
consecutive month of rising prices, inventories approaching
historical lows and sloppy shopping weather, an industry tracker
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Escrow closed last month on 789 previously owned single-family
homes, an increase of 85 from the number sold in February 1999,
said the monthly market compilation from the Southland Regional
Association of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   The median price hit $225,000, up $15,000 from February 1999.
Prices last declined on an annual basis in February 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The San Fernando Valley's median peaked at $245,000, reaching
that level three times in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing remarkable strength in the market right now,''
said John Karevoll, an analyst with Acxiom/DataQuick.
</P>
<P>
   Including the condominium sector, sales increased 15 percent on
an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
   The February sales performance outdid all posted for that month
since 1989 and 1990, the association reported.
</P>
<P>
   Sales had been softening recently, so February's numbers caught
some industry watchers off guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I was surprised by the heavy sales activity,'' said
Realtors group President Mitch Davis.
</P>
<P>
   He estimates that prices will rise by 5 percent to 6 percent for
all of this year over 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also note the Los Angeles region is one of the hottest
in the nation for price appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   Karevoll said prices are close to historical highs in Orange and
San Diego counties, and it could happen in the Valley by summer.
</P>
<P>
   Nima Nattagh, an analyst at First Americal Real Estate Solution,
said February's strong performance should not be considered
trend-setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``January and February, and to some extent December, are
difficult months to analyze and come up with some sort of a
consistent projection,'' he said. ``We'll probably see some
slowdown in the market, although I don't think it will be any cause
for concern.''
</P>
<P>
   One worry, though, is the inventory. Fewer new homes are being
built these days while the region's population continues to
increase.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the number of new listings declined 12.5 percent to
1,434 and total active listings plunged 18.1 percent to 3,395.
</P>
<P>
   Both Link and Davis can't recall a time in the past 20 years
when the number of properties for sale was so low.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason why condominium sales jumped 25.6 percent last
month to 285 units. These are getting more expensive, too, with the
median price at $131,000, an 11.5 percent gain in the past 12
months.
</P>
<P>
   And price appreciation in both sectors is not yet closing big
numbers of buyers out of the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we're seeing activity in every price range and
geographic area,'' Karevoll said. ``We're constantly being asked if
the entry-level market is still functional, and it is. The
entry-level market in the whole county is very active.''

VIZCAINO SAYS HE'S BEEN CAUGHT SHORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ For the second consecutive spring, Jose
Vizcaino was told he would have a chance to win the Dodgers'
shortstop job.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, he lost out to Mark Grudzielanek. This year, an
unhappy Vizcaino believes he was never given a chance.
</P>
<P>
   While Alex Cora, Juan Castro and Kevin Elster battle for the
starting shortstop job, Vizcaino feels as if he's been left out of
the equation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to try for a shortstop job,'' Vizcaino said. ``It's
what (general manager) Kevin Malone told my agent, and that's not
what has happened. I'm just here to be a backup, a utility player.
It's not like I was fighting for a job. I came here to work hard
and play every day, and that's not what it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bothers me. If you told me what my role was going to be
before I came here, that's different.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone said all player personnel decisions are left up to the
uniformed personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said Cora, the front-runner for
the spot, Elster, Castro and Vizcaino were all in the mix. But it's
no secret Johnson likes Vizcaino's versatility, which makes him an
ideal utility player.
</P>
<P>
   Vizcaino played shortstop, second base and third base last
season, and his switch-batting capability only accentuates his role
as a vital utility player.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the one thing about the way I manage a team is, No.1, I
let everybody go play,'' Johnson said. ``By their performance, and
by the needs of the team, that defines roles. The players define
their own roles. For me, like I told him last year, you're more
valuable to me being in that utility role. And I still see him that
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know early on he wanted me to give him the job, but then I
was going to be short a guy that could do what he could do. I think
it may have been hard for him to take last year, but I think he
understood it. Even when we talked (last year), he said
Grudzielanek deserves to be playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Vizcaino, 32, understands his value as a utility player, but
he's still bothered by his lack of playing time at shortstop.
Through the Dodgers' first 13 Grapefruit League games, Vizcaino
played 10 innings at shortstop. Castro played 17, Elster was at 32
and Cora had 43. By contrast, Vizcaino has played 12 innings at
third and eight at second.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's it, you come to me and tell me,'' Vizcaino said.
``You tell me this is how it is. That's different. You can't tell
me this is how it's going to be and then you come here and it's
different. I understand that, but just tell me right away what
you're going to do so I can be prepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to know what my role is going to be. It's nice to
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, with his focus on trying to win the shortstop job,
Vizcaino has done most of his work in the spring at shortstop. He
said he hasn't taken many balls at second or third base.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers talked during the winter about trading Vizcaino. The
Atlanta Braves were one of several teams interested in acquiring
him, numerous industry sources said, but the sticking point was the
$3.5 million Vizcaino's due this season.
</P>
<P>
   Vizcaino, a 10-year veteran, was signed to a three-year
free-agent deal after the 1997 season and was supposed to be the
starting shortstop. But he missed the final three months of the
1998 season with a severe ankle sprain, and with the Dodgers making
a playoff push, they traded for Grudzielanek.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring Vizcaino battled Grudzielanek for the starting
shortstop job, but Grudzielanek, favored by management in the
competition, won the spot.
</P>
<P>
   Vizcaino, in turn, fell into the utility role. He started 40
games at shortstop, 15 games at second base and five games at
third. The opportunity arose to claim the starting shortstop job
when Grudzielanek spent five weeks on the disabled list with a
broken hand, but Vizcaino hit .214 during the spell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year I didn't know until the end,'' Vizcaino said. ``This
year, I knew since the beginning. I figured it out.'' &QL;

MARCH MADNESS WHITTLED DOWN
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Bob Huggins is whining. Lute Olson is smiling. The
East is a beast. The South is least. Indiana State is going back to
Salt Lake City. Southwest Missouri got shunned _ what a pity.
Michigan State's the team to beat. Louisiana State's the team to
fear. Aside from that, nothing's clear.
</P>
<P>
   Tark must have seen his shadow, because March Madness arrived a
week early.
</P>
<P>
   If the NCAA Tournament is anything like Championship Week, it'll
be quite a ride to Indianapolis. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
EAST
</P>
<P>
   In Winston-Salem: Duke smashes Lamar. Kansas' coaching beats
DePaul's lack of. Florida edges underrated Butler, and Illinois
spanks Penn.
</P>
<P>
   One of the tastiest second-round games of the tournament is
Florida-Illinois, matching Illini coach Lon Kruger against the team
he took to the 1994 Final Four. He stomps on Gators counterpart
Slick Billy Donovan.
</P>
<P>
   Duke sticks it to Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   In Buffalo: Sure, Pepperdine got dinged with an 11th seed, but
look at it this way: The Waves have the guard play and athleticism
to beat Indiana. Problem is, the Hoosiers have A.J. Guyton, who
beats the Waves by himself.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon beats Seton Hall in the game of the day. Oklahoma State
dismantles Hofstra, and Temple does the same to Lafayette.
</P>
<P>
   In the second round, Temple's zone stymies Oregon's attack, and
Oklahoma State coach Eddie Sutton beats Bob Knight.
</P>
<P>
   In Syracuse: Here it is, the upset of the tournament: Kruger
outcoaches Coach K, Duke's freshmen struggle and Illinois stuns the
Blue Devils. Two days later, every Duke player declares for the NBA
Draft. Two weeks later, Coach K signs eight McDonald's
All-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In the other Sweet 16 game, Temple grinds Oklahoma State 38-36.
``We can't allow 38 points and expect to win,'' Sutton says.
</P>
<P>
   Temple beats Illinois and takes lovable coach John Chaney to his
first Final Four. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SOUTH
</P>
<P>
   In Birmingham: Hours before the game, Missouri coach Quin Snyder
dials his old boss, Coach K, and gets the blueprint for beating
North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Utah State (Bernard) Rock and (Troy) Rolle over Connecticut in
the biggest non-upset upset of the first round. The Aggies haven't
lost since January; UConn hasn't lost since Saturday. (Note: No.12
seeds have won a first-round game 11 straight years.)
</P>
<P>
   Stanford celebrates UConn's ouster and names its score against
South Carolina State. Tennessee beats Louisiana-Lafayette.
</P>
<P>
   In the second round, Missouri hangs with Stanford for 35
minutes, then Cardinal guard David Moseley takes control. Tennessee
beats Utah State.
</P>
<P>
   In Nashville: The team to watch is Miami, with its smothering
defense and senior guards Johnny Hemsley and Vernon Jennings. (Yes,
the guys who almost beat UCLA two years ago.) In a tough, sloppy
game, the Hurricanes end Arkansas' season.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State beats Appalachian State and Tulsa beats UNLV.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati coach Bob Huggins is right: The Bearcats shouldn't be
a No.2 seed. They should be a No.4. Without Kenyon Martin, they're
nothing more than a bunch of athletes with no concept of structured
offense. After beating UNC-Wilmington, the Bearcats fall to Tulsa
in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Miami upsets Ohio State and Columbus sighs: Only five months
until football.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin: Stanford beats Tennessee as Moseley continues his Art
Lee impersonation (sans choke gesture). Miami plows past Tulsa.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the nation's best defenses meet in the regional final.
The difference is Miami's guards, who smother Moseley and Casey
Jacobsen. With no perimeter game, the Cardinal becomes
one-dimensional. Mark Madsen and Jarron Collins can't win playing
two-against-five. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
MIDWEST
</P>
<P>
   In Cleveland: Easiest upset pick of the first round is Samford,
which beat St. John's a few months ago, over Syracuse. Samford
considers joining the Big East, then realizes there's more
competition in the TAAC (Trans America Athletic Conference).
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky, without suspended guard Desmond Allison (DUI),
outlasts St. Bonaventure, and Michigan State hammers Valpo. Saint
Louis continues its amazing run as coach Lorenzo Romar beats one of
his coaching idols, Utah's Rick Majerus.
</P>
<P>
   In the second round, Michigan State pounds Saint Louis and
Kentucky beats Samford.
</P>
<P>
   In Minneapolis: UCLA's first-round loss to Detroit Mercy last
year was easy to see. Not so this season. The Bruins have more
weapons, and Ball State will let them play.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland pounds Iona. With Chris Porter seated in row 10 (next
to his agent), Auburn beats Creighton. Iowa State crushes Central
Connecticut State.
</P>
<P>
   In the second round, Iowa State ends Auburn's tumultuous month
and UCLA upsets Maryland, avenging an embarrassing loss to the
Terps in last seasons' Puerto Rico Shootout.
</P>
<P>
   In Detroit: Michigan State, experienced, tough and versatile,
sends Kentucky home. UCLA's eight-game winning streak ends as
Cyclones guard Jamaal Tinsley not All-American Marcus Fizer makes
the decisive baskets down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Behind Mo Peterson and Mateen Cleaves, Michigan State beats Iowa
State to become the only repeat Final Four entry. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
WEST
</P>
<P>
   In Salt Lake City: Selection committee chairman Craig Thompson
said Arizona's victory over Stanford proved the Wildcats deserved a
No.1 seed without injured center Loren Woods (out for the
tournament).
</P>
<P>
   But didn't Arizona lose at Oregon and !ital!Oregon State!off!
two weeks ago? Lute Olson has done a masterful job this season, but
the Wildcats aren't a No.1, not without Woods. As usual, the
committee sees what it wants to see.
</P>
<P>
   That said, Arizona crushes Jackson State.
</P>
<P>
   The juiciest game of the tournament is the second-round
Arizona-Fresno State matchup, since Olson and Jerry Tarkanian
despise each other. But Wisconsin cancels the lovefest by beating
Tark despite 45 points from Courtney Szczerbiak Alexander. (You can
look it up.)
</P>
<P>
   Indiana State _ playing its first game in Salt Lake City since
Larry Bird's Sycamores lost to Michigan State in the legendary 1979
title game upsets Texas, which hasn't won an important game outside
Austin in 12 years. (You can look that up, too.)
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana State swiftly defeats Southeast Missouri State.
</P>
<P>
   In the second round, Wisconsin crawls past the frustrated
Wildcats, 17-15. LSU beats ISU to advance to the S16.
</P>
<P>
   In Tucson: Guard Erick Barkley is suspended for the first half,
quits the team at halftime, then returns for the last five minutes
and leads St. John's past Northern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga, seeded 10th in the West (just like last year), loses to
Louisville. (Where have you gone, Quentin Hall?) Oklahoma pounds
Winthrop. Purdue beats Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   In the second round, St. John's beats Louisville and Purdue
upsets Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   In Albuquerque: Louisiana State rallies in the final minutes to
beat Wisconsin, and St. John's beats Purdue.
</P>

SHAQ GETS 40 AS LAKERS STREAK REACHES 19
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ There was no need for added dramatic effect, no motive
for attaching another encore to a virtuoso performance that has
already reached peak levels many times over. But Shaquille O'Neal
was not ready to retreat backstage, or to the infirmary.
</P>
<P>
   Not before another thundering crescendo and a final bow.
</P>
<P>
   So O'Neal dropped 40 points on the Denver Nuggets on Monday for
a 118-108 Lakers victory at Pepsi Center. And only afterward did
anyone let on that he was nearly held out because of a nagging
right hamstring that has apparently bothered him for a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big fella, he amazes me at every turn,'' said teammate
Glen Rice, who added 20 points.
</P>
<P>
   It was a timely performance too, coinciding with an equally
incredible feat: The win extended the Lakers' streak to 19 games,
third best in NBA history. They can tie the second-best mark with a
win Thursday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The effects of O'Neal's injury showed up in his rebounds (nine)
and blocked shots (one), but nowhere else. He scored 18 points in a
second half that he wasn't supposed to play and eight points in the
fourth quarter, in which he also made all six of his free-throw
attempts.
</P>
<P>
   He finished 14 for 20 from the field, 12 for 16 from the line
and was last seen searching for a Kinko's, because he needs to add
a new page to that MVP application.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a guy with a hamstring injury, and to be able to
go out there and gut it out and put up the type of performance that
he did tonight, just says a lot about how much he's grown and the
determination,'' Rice said. ``We wondered (if O'Neal would play),
and we figured that the big guy would go out there and whether it
be eight minutes or 10 minutes, he's going to give it his all. He
got it going on and it loosened up on him and he just stayed out
there and continued to play.''
</P>
<P>
   For 44 minutes, in fact. All of it was needed as the Lakers
fought back low energy (after a comeback win the night before
against Sacramento), high altitude and the uptempo, athletic
Nuggets.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers never trailed in the second half, but they never
could put the Nuggets away, either, as six Denver players scored in
double figures, led by Chris Gatling's 25 and Keon Clark's 18.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Phil Jackson said it was ``debatable whether we would
play'' O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought maybe we'd start him the first half, and the second
half just for a few minutes,'' Jackson said, ``and once he got
going, he wanted to stay and played a great game for us out there
offensively. He wasn't mobile enough to rebound and do some of the
things we like him to do defensively, but the rest of his game was
great _ assist level (seven), etc.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all of it, and Kobe Bryant's 22 points, the Nuggets were
within five points, 107-102, with 2:30 left. But O'Neal hit four
free throws down the stretch and fed Brian Shaw on consecutive
layups, the latter a 3-point play, to make it a double-digit lead
again. Shaw finished with a season-high 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all right,'' said O'Neal. ``I'm a little sore. Probably
take the next couple days off, stretch it, but I'm OK.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, who said he's been sore since the Miami game on March 5,
said he was fine once he got warmed up. He's now averaging 42.3
points in the last four games, all with the hamstring injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sucked it up,'' he said. ``Cause I have heart. And I'm on a
mission.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers moved another step in that mission with their 10th
straight road win, improving their NBA-best record to 53-11.
They'll go for consecutive win No. 20 at Washington on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   All along, they've tried to ignore the streak, but they will
embrace that milestone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'd be nice,'' Bryant said, ``because this whole season we've
achieved some things that other teams have not achieved. So it'd be
nice to have that.'' &QL;

AFTER CELEBRATING, PEPPERDINE GETS DOWN TO BUSINESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif _ There was only token evidence around campus
Monday indicating Pepperdine was playing in the NCAA Tournament.
The first was the bus outside Firestone Fieldhouse with the sign on
the side reading: ``Bound 4 the Big Dance.''
</P>
<P>
   The other was the larger-than-usual media gathering at the
Waves' late-afternoon practice. Otherwise, it was business as usual
as Pepperdine began serious preparation for Indiana, its
first-round opponent in Friday's East Regional in Buffalo, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Tipoff is set for 7 p.m. PST.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th-seeded Waves (24-8) practiced Sunday night after
learning who their opponent would be, but the air of euphoria
lingered over landing in the tournament. By Monday they were back
in a normal routine, putting in a game plan for the sixth-seeded
Hoosiers (20-8), who finished fifth in the Big Ten.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the regular routine will last much longer. Pepperdine
travels early Wednesday morning to Buffalo, eliminating a normal
practice day. That's the disadvantage teams from the West face when
they play in the East region. Everyone else, including Indiana, can
practice in the morning and travel in the afternoon on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   That puts added significance on the Waves' two home practices
this week. After Tuesday, their next workout comes in Buffalo a day
before the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get a lot of things accomplished (Monday and
today),'' Waves coach Jan van Breda Kolff said. ``But at this stage
of the season, we've played 32 games, we've played against teams
with similar styles to Indiana. You don't really need six days of
practice to get ready.''
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!It's good to be the Prince:!off! Perhaps no one was more
relieved when Pepperdine made the tournament than senior Tommie
Prince, whose college career has had many twists, to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-5 forward originally signed with UCLA out of Compton
Dominguez High in 1995 but was not admitted into school when his
SAT test score was invalidated. He enrolled at Arizona State in
August of 1995, and redshirted his first year as a Prop 48. In
March of 1996, Prince was arrested along with teammate Gee Gervin
and Rico Harris for an alleged sexual and physical assault of a
female student. The charges were later dropped, but Prince left
Tempe and transferred to Pepperdine in time for the 1996-97 season.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a strange ride, but here he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had butterflies throughout the whole (selection process)
situation, but I felt pretty good about the season we had as far as
the wins we had,'' Prince said. ``But it's definitely a plus for me
to be here, considering everything I've been through. To make it in
my senior year, I couldn't have hoped for anything better.'' &QL;

BEACH, BABES AND BRAZEN ASSAULTS ON PC 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone with half a brain and a sliver of sensitivity would be
outraged, offended and otherwise huffy about ``Son of the Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   So I giggled in gales.
</P>
<P>
   The guilty high lasted about 15 minutes, until the new FX cable
series, produced by Howard Stern, began reprocessing the same
jokes.
</P>
<P>
   By my reckoning, that still leaves me with a quarter of a brain,
good enough for TV work. I gave up on sensitivity a long time ago,
as many readers have kindly noted.
</P>
<P>
   The show, premiering Tuesday, is a ``Naked Gun''-style spoof of
``Baywatch,'' starring the decidedly unbuff Tim Stack (remember
``Nightstand With Dick Dietrick''?) as Notch Johnson, the world's
greatest lifeguard.
</P>
<P>
   Notch's dimmer light is fixed on a permanent low setting, but
he's still several watts brighter than his fellow lifeguards.
</P>
<P>
   They're dumb blonde B.J. Cummings (Playboy Playmate Jaime
Bergman), German beef boy Chip Rommel (Roland Kickinger) and
inner-city recruit Jamaica St. Croix (Leila Arcieri). The lone
representative of normal intelligence is junior lifeguard Kimberlee
Clark (Kim Oja).
</P>
<P>
   The all-out assault on political correctness includes broad
swipes at Asians, Germans, blondes, fat people, sick children,
gays, Kathie Lee Gifford and Gifford's darling son, Cody.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Kathie Lee jokes don't fall technically into the
politically incorrect category. Like I said, a quarter of a brain.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, there are dozens of genitalia jokes with a juvenilia
slant. Notch's last name, a slang term for penis, is worn to
flaccidity before the third commercial break.
</P>
<P>
   The show's first gust of vulgarity, though, is funny for anyone
susceptible to tasteless, brazenly stupid humor. That'd be me.
</P>
<P>
   It begins with a couple of Central Casting Asian thugs shipping
a group of young women off to America for servitude as prostitutes.
When one washes ashore, starving, in Southern California, Notch and
his gang _ did I mention Steve, the humping dog? _ try to help.
</P>
<P>
   B.J.: ``I only wish we knew what Cambodians (she pronounces it
Cam-bo-DEE-ans) like to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Cut to Steve, the dog, scurrying for cover.
</P>
<P>
   Notch does some checking and reports to the castaway, ``My
snitch tells me your sisters are working in a massage parlor.''
</P>
<P>
   B.J.: ``Thank God they're not prostitutes.''
</P>
<P>
   And so on. We needn't get into the matter of B.J.'s last name.
Oh, what the heck. ``It's a nickname,'' she chirps. ``I got it from
the men's volleyball team.''
</P>
<P>
   As the lifeguards go about rescuing the newly arrived Asian
women, the villainous Mayor Anita Massengil (Lisa Banes), who hates
Notch for some reason, tries to sabotage his annual Lifeguard Show
for Sick Kids.
</P>
<P>
   Massengil's accomplice is her equally malevolent gay son, Cody
(Jason Hopkins). Apologies to Kathie Lee.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with broad spoofs is that the laughs can turn to
yawns in a hurry. ``S.O.B.'' barely lasts 15 minutes until it
empties the joke bin, begins to repeat itself and finally wilts
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   What does that portend for ``S.O.B.'' in Weeks 3, and 4, and 5?
It could mean viewers flexing their forefingers on their remotes
while the show's writers belabor doggie scatology. Buh-bye.
</P>
<P>
   And anyway, isn't ``Baywatch'' pretty much its own spoof?
</P>
<P>
   Stern isn't the ``S.O.B.'' creator _ Stack claims that honor _
but the radio star has involved himself as executive producer and
avid script reader. One scene, focusing erotically on the slo-mo
application of sunblock, has Stern oiled all over it.
</P>
<P>
   Stern has also been flogging the thing mercilessly on his
syndicated radio program.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, a caller to the radio show told Stern that Los
Angeles traffic had been snarled by a man threatening to jump onto
a freeway from a ramp.
</P>
<P>
   Stern didn't miss a beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it's not Tim Stack,'' he said. ``I need him for another
seven (episodes).''

KINGS WIN 3-2 IN OT TO CAP BIG DAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ These are heady days for the Kings, who are a good
team that suddenly became better.
</P>
<P>
   On the night they moved ahead of Phoenix in the Western
Conference playoff race with a 3-2 overtime victory against
Vancouver, the Kings improved their postseason possibilities Monday
by acquiring rugged right wing Kelly Buchberger and smooth-skating
Nelson Emerson from the Atlanta Thrashers.
</P>
<P>
   It cost them disgruntled Donald Audette, who had fallen out of
the mix through injuries and inconsistency. Audette didn't play
against Vancouver, but before he left for Atlanta, he wrote a big
``Good Luck'' on the blackboard in the Kings dressing room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure is a lot of stuff going on,'' said Jozef Stumpel, who
scored his third game-winning goal on the Kings' seven-game
homestand. ``It's great. Everybody is excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Stumpel scored when a shot by Sean O'Donnell glanced off his
skate and past Canucks goaltender Felix Potvin. The play was
reviewed for several minutes, but the Staples Center crowd of
17,309 knew this was too good a day to lose a goal on a
technicality.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Rob Blake even scored a power-play goal, the Kings'
first in four games (1 for 20). And turns out he and Emerson are
old college buddies from their days at Bowling Green.
</P>
<P>
   The victory moved them into second place in the Pacific Division
and past Phoenix, which lost. If the Kings, who face the Mighty
Ducks on Wednesday in Anaheim, hold the No.5 spot in the Western
Conference, they could be looking at a first-round playoff date
with the Detroit Red Wings. Sixth probably would mean facing
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, a player of Buchberger's grit and playoff experience
was deemed critical by general manager Dave Taylor, who also sent
minor-league defenseman Frantisek Kaberle to the Thrashers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spoke to Kelly and he is very excited about coming,'' Taylor
said. ``He brings great pluses to our team, not just in the
playoffs but down the stretch. He is a tremendous leader and we'll
need that the rest of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Kings leading scorer Ziggy Palffy gave them a 2-1 lead with just
74 seconds left in the second period, but Alexander Mogilny scored
midway through the third period to send the game into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   But in a season where each games seemed so critical, the action
took a back seat to the Kings boardroom.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor had been trying to unload Audette, whose scoring and
attitude had dipped from last season. Emerson is expected to take
his place on the Kings' second line with center Bryan Smolinski and
winger Glen Murray. He also becomes the Kings' second option after
Blake as point man on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   But the key to the deal is Buchberger (pronounced Book-burger),
who will replace winger Marko Tuomainen on the third (checking)
line. Before being selected by Atlanta in last summer's expansion
draft, he played 11 full seasons with the Edmonton Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   Seven times, he reached the playoffs and played on three Stanley
Cup championship teams (1987, 1988, 1990). Goaltender Stephane
Fiset (Colorado 1996) is the only other King to play on a Stanley
Cup champion.
</P>
<P>
   Buchberger, 33, isn't much of a scorer. He has just 87 goals in
862 career games, with a career-high 20 during the 1991-92 season.
This year, Buchberger played 67 games for Atlanta, with five goals
and 17 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings were hoping to avoid taking on any multiyear contracts
but inherited two with Buchberger and Emerson.
</P>
<P>
   Buchberger is earning $800,000 this season but has two more
years to run on his contract. Emerson is making $1.7 million this
year and has three left after this season.
</P>
<P>
   Audette is earning $2.2 million this year and is eligible for
unrestricted free agency after the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The salaries are pretty much a wash this year,'' Taylor said.
``We take on a little more in the next few years, but we think this
brings us closer to where we want to go.'' &QL;

BALL STATE LOOKS MUCH LIKE UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ All the possible opponents, all the disparate
styles and philosophies, all the distinctive problems and
personalties, and for its first-round opponent UCLA draws ... its
fraternal twin.
</P>
<P>
   Mid-season swoons? Ball State knows all about them. Fast
finishes to make the NCAA Tournament? Ball State's was blinding.
Gifted freshman? Ball State's got one. Stellar late-season guard
play? Ball State has it.
</P>
<P>
   Victory over Purdue? Ball State's got one of those, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be a great game,'' said Purdue assistant coach Jay
Price, whose team lost to UCLA by two points and to Ball State by
20. ``Ball State is very athletic, and they play with a lot of
emotion. They have scorers. They play decent defense, and they're
hard-nosed. They won't be intimidated by UCLA.''
</P>
<P>
   Both teams started well. UCLA was 8-2; Ball State was 10-1. Both
lost six of seven games during conference play and seemed destined
for the NIT. Both regrouped, then finished with a rush. The Bruins
won their final six games. Ball State has won 11 of its last 12,
including three in the Mid-American Conference tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals (22-8) haven't won an NCAA game since 1990, but
they're eager to join the MAC's tournament success. Its members
have won first-round games in four of the last five years:
Miami-Ohio beat No.5 seed Arizona in 1995 and No.7 Washington last
year; Eastern Michigan beat No.8 seed Duke in 1996; and Western
Michigan beat No.6 Clemson in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The MAC is very underrated as a conference,'' Price said.
``We've played a lot of MAC schools, and they all have good coaches
and good players. Their starting fives are good. Depth is the one
place they tend to struggle. But Ball State is deep.''
</P>
<P>
   As are the Bruins. The similarities don't end there. UCLA
freshman forward Jason Kapono leads the team in scoring and was
named Pac-10 co-freshman of the year. Ball State freshman forward
Theron Smith is the Cardinals' top rebounder (7.7 per game) and
No.2 scorer (12.4 per game), and he was named MAC freshman of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a high-Division I player,'' Price said. ``He could
definitely play in the Big Ten.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as junior guard Earl Watson fueled UCLA's late-season
charge he's averaging six assists and 2.7 turnovers during the
winning streak so did Ball State senior guard Duane Clemens guide
the Cardinals to the MAC title.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, 6-feet, is an athletic left-hander who averaged 21.6
points in the MAC tournament and played the season with his
grandfather's obituary folded in his sock.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's taken every big shot for us,'' Cardinals point guard
Mickey Hosier said. ``He's a skinny kid, but he finds a way to put
the ball in the basket. He's our leader, and we're going to ride
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as UCLA's February slump strengthened its resolve, so did
Ball State's January spiral create the cohesion needed for its
remarkable finish. The problems began with two consecutive
triple-overtime defeats (to Eastern Michigan and Miami-Ohio).
</P>
<P>
   ``That really affected us, and then we played four games in
(nine) days,'' Hosier said. ``But we had a week off to practice and
get our confidence back, and we started rolling.''
</P>
<P>
   Although similar, the teams are not identical.
</P>
<P>
   Ball State is tough and tenacious every game. UCLA is prone to
lethargy.
</P>
<P>
   Ball State is an excellent 3-point shooting team with a passable
inside attack. UCLA is an inconsistent 3-point shooting team that
favors its frontcourt.
</P>
<P>
   Ball State's big men do not have NBA talent. UCLA's do.
</P>
<P>
   Ball State does not have four McDonald's All-Americans. UCLA
does.
</P>
<P>
   ``UCLA is capable of putting it together and talented enough to
make a Final Four run,'' Ball State coach Ray McCallum said. ``A
lot of times teams go through adversity and come together.''
</P>
<P>
   He should know. &QL;

 &HT;    Cover your disaster
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Getting slammed by a tornado, or any other natural
disaster, is bad luck. But neglecting common-sense precautions is
bad judgment.
</P>
<P>
   You can deal with emotional trauma later on, if big winds or
other disasters come your way. Now is the time to protect all those
financial arrangements that mean so much to your household.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's tornado season began this month, and the peak dangers
will last through May. After that comes hurricane season. Fires and
burglaries are never out of season.
</P>
<P>
   Such disasters, by definition, are unpredictable. Georgia's
first nasty storm of this season came on Valentine's Day, killing
18 people and destroying more than 450 homes in the far south part
of the state.
</P>
<P>
   It's that unpredictability you want to guard against. ``Some
people are very thorough, but for a lot of us, it's something we
always mean to get around to,'' said Marilyn Self, the American Red
Cross' director of disaster education. ``It's something we'll get
to when we're not quite so busy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the realm of personal finance, the steps are easy to list:
Inventory your possessions. Make sure they are adequately insured.
Safeguard your financial records.
</P>
<P>
   An inventory is crucial _ the record that shows what you own
even if most of it gets blown away.
</P>
<P>
   Your property inventory is the best document you will have if
you need to make a big, comprehensive claim with your insurance
company. If all of your property has blown away, your inventory is
the best proof you can offer to an insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   You should make a visual record, photographs or a videotape, of
every room in the house. Don't forget to record the contents of
cabinets and closets. ``Many times, people underestimate their
claims because they just don't remember all the things they have,''
Self said.
</P>
<P>
   The visual record is a supplement to written lists. It may help
if you organize and build your list room-by-room.
</P>
<P>
   If you need a kick-start, check the resource list for Internet
sites that will help get you organized. Another alternative is in
personal finance software, such as Quicken, that includes an
inventory section.
</P>
<P>
   Pay particular attention to expensive items, such as antiques,
collectibles, electronics and appliances. For them, record purchase
dates and prices, plus serial numbers or appraisals where
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be careless about preserving your inventory. ``We suggest
keeping it not in your house but in an extremely safe place,'' said
spokesman Dave Colmans of the Georgia Insurance Information
Service. Safe-deposit boxes are the first choice, though some
people send this record to out-of-town family members.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance _ getting it or upgrading it _ is the second step.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important point is to make sure your coverage has
kept up with the cost of your property,'' Colmans said.
</P>
<P>
   To keep up with inflation in housing prices, many homeowners pay
extra fees to get replacement value coverage on their home.
</P>
<P>
   That goes for contents as well the house. ``Otherwise, your
coverage will be what amounts to depreciated costs,'' said Colmans.
``Your television is worth almost nothing after five years, for
example.''
</P>
<P>
   Note that insurance policies usually set limits on how much they
will pay for losses of jewelry, fine art, camera equipment or
computers. If you have more than the limit, ask about the cost of
extra coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Renters should recognize that the landlord's insurance covers
his building, not your apartment full of property. Only one in four
renters has bothered with insuring his or her goods, which is a
mistake. ``We saw a real increase in interest after that day last
year when there were lightning strikes and apartment buildings were
burning in several places on the same day,'' Colmans observed.
</P>
<P>
   Flood insurance doesn't come with basic homeowners and renters
policies. You'll have to buy that extra, if flooding is a
possibility on your property.
</P>
<P>
   On auto insurance, comprehensive coverage is what pays for
storm, fire or flood damage. You may also want a provision to pay
for a rental car while yours is being repaired.
</P>
<P>
   Preserving your records is relatively simple, though it may
require you to make extra copies of crucial paperwork. Some items
go into an evacuation box; others go to a safe-deposit box.
</P>
<P>
   The evacuation box is a sturdy container at home, one you can
snatch up and take with you. Documents should be filed in
waterproof plastic bags.
</P>
<P>
   A safe-deposit box is for papers and computer backups that you
can't afford to lose but don't expect to need immediately. Your
household inventory records go there, along with stock
certificates, perhaps some keepsakes and all the items on the
checklist.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few more items to consider:
</P>
<P>
   _ An emergency fund. The traveler's checks in your evacuation
box will get you into a motel. Thoughtful people often stash away a
larger amount of savings, often enough to cover three months of
living expenses, in case of job losses or other disasters. A
tornado might well qualify.
</P>
<P>
   _ A where-everything-is list. This would tell your family the
locations of bank accounts and other assets, wills, documents
stating your last wishes, insurance policies and persons to
contact. Your list typically should be left with an attorney or
trusted family member.
</P>
<P>
   _ Medications. If there are some you truly can't live without,
it's best to keep a small supply away from your home.
</P>
<P>
   _ A good book on the basics is Janet Bamford's ``Smarter
Insurance Solutions.'' It costs $19.95. You can order it by calling
(800) 233-4830.
</P>
<P>
   _ For a useful pamphlet with detailed advice, go to www.nefe.org
and search for ``Before Disaster Strikes.'' Or call the American
Red Cross at (404) 876-3302.

 &HT;    Old hotel wears history well
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CEDAR KEY, Fla. _ I swallowed the last bite of tiramisu and
scraped back my chair along the bare boards of the hotel dining
room floor. ``I'm going to check out the bar,'' I said. If my
dinner companions, both of whom have known me since high school,
were a bit surprised at my abrupt leave-taking, they didn't let on.
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, wandering into bars is not a habit of mine, but this
one I had to see. The Neptune Bar in the 140-year-old Island Hotel,
boasts that it's the only one in all of Levy County without a
television. Throughout dinner I'd been trying to picture a place
where folks go to practice the almost extinct art of conversation
rather than to stare bug-eyed at a speeding spheroid and indulge in
little more chat than to intermittently yell, ``GO, YOU HAIRY
DAWGS!''
</P>
<P>
   On my way through the lobby, I stopped to help Hannah and Annie,
the resident German shepherds, search for the red rubber ball
they'd lost under a low table. During dinner, we had commented on
how well behaved the girls were _ occasionally peeking around the
corner into the dining room but never setting foot inside.
</P>
<P>
   I fished out the ball and Hannah thanked me with a nuzzle.
Annie, the pup, grabbed it and ran.
</P>
<P>
   Just around the corner, the Neptune Bar was even better than I'd
hoped _ the kind of a place we'd all like to have in our
neighborhoods, where folks stop in for a drink, a chat, and maybe
even a hand or two of friendly bridge _ kibitzers encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   And no television.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, behind the bar is an elaborate mural of its namesake,
the ancient Roman god of the sea. Painted in 1948 by Helen Tooker,
it shows the royal denizen of the briny with a trident in his left
hand and a bare-breasted mermaid on his lap.
</P>
<P>
   When new owners took over the hotel in 1992, the Neptune had to
be rebuilt because a previous proprietor, a New England school
marm, had closed the bar to the public and (to the disgust of the
natives) turned it into a coffee and juice bar. Some regulars were
so incensed that they buried the owner in effigy in front of the
Post Office. ``A dubious honor,'' according to one historian,
``that had been previously awarded only to politicians who lost in
the local city commission elections.''
</P>
<P>
   A longtime patron of the pub volunteered his carpentry skills to
help restore it. His romance with the Neptune goes all the way back
to his boyhood when he had sneaked a peek around the door for a
glimpse of the mermaid _ the first naked lady he'd ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1950, the mural was stained by water leaking from
upstairs guest rooms when the roof was blown off in a hurricane.
And in 1993, when the painting was removed for restoration, bullet
slugs were found embedded in the wall behind it, grim evidence of
its lively past.
</P>
<P>
   Florida songwriter and balladeer Jimmy Buffet, a frequent
visitor to the Island Hotel, used to give impromptu concerts in the
Neptune. Once, he sat outside on the balcony singing to folks
passing by on Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   Famous names live on in the hotel's register: writer Pearl Buck,
singers Vaughn Monroe and Tennessee Ernie Ford, actresses Frances
Langford and Myrna Loy.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Boone, best known for his small-screen Paladin role,
spent time here, too, writing each morning and holding court in the
Neptune Bar come evening.
</P>
<P>
   The Island Hotel, built of massive 12-inch oak supports and
seashell tabby walls 10 inches thick, has withstood hurricanes,
tidal waves, and even the Civil War. Historians suggest it survived
the see-saw occupation, first by Union and then by Confederate
troops (the owner at that time was a Confederate
</P>
<P>
   major) because of its usefulness as a barracks and warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Personifying the 140-year-old structure, one historian describes
it as a building with uneven floors, expanding and contracting with
the seasons, and having all the aches and pains of an elderly lady.
</P>
<P>
   And a grand lady she is, too. She wears her history well.

 &HT;    Pontiac Sunfire GT not lacking in spirit
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The ``pocket rocket'' segment of the auto market is
supposed to be history because of changing tastes, safety concerns
and fuel costs, but Pontiac blithely soldiers on with its Sunfire
GT, a spirited sprinter with attitude.
</P>
<P>
   The latter comes from an aggressive front end with low-slung fog
lamps, aero body-side trim and a teensy rear spoiler. Lively
performance comes from a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine worth 150
horsepower and 155 pounds-feet of torque mated to a smooth
German-built, five-speed Getrag shifter.
</P>
<P>
   The Sunfire, with a base price of $14,420, is Pontiac's
entry-level offering, but the numbers move on up to $16,210 for the
GT and $21,610 for the GT convertible. The EPA labels the coupe and
droptop a subcompact but gives the $14,010 four-door a compact tag.
Either way, it's a small car.
</P>
<P>
   The Sunfire GT is fun, though, as long as you stay away from
speed limits _ the GT's not a stealth machine _ and heavy traffic.
It gives good road feel with enough steering-wheel feedback to
satisfy drivers who decry numbed-down steering. The
performance/economy compromise is a good one with the GT pegged at
23 mpg regular unleaded in the city and 33 on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Pontiac's efforts to upscale the Sunfire, it is
essentially a pumped-up Chevrolet Cavalier _ so, in coupe guise,
that means it's your basic two-adult car. Sitting in the rear is no
fun, but, hey, the entire rear seat back does fold down to provide
good cargo room. (It doesn't lock, not even on convertibles, which
can be an irritant).
</P>
<P>
   Few cars come with more options than the Sunfire, which does
make it possible to cater to individual tastes. The youth market,
which the Sunfire targets, is certain to appreciate the 200-watt,
eight-speaker Monsoon stereo system that tops the list of audio
offerings. A point Pontiac pushed is the RDS, or Radio Data
Systems, receiver that displays secondary signals on the FM band.
It'll identify stations and the format and pick up other text
messages such as weather forecasts, sports scores and even name
that tune.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the GT does lack the refinement of some of its
competitors. It's a bit of a throwback, sure, but give Pontiac
credit for making an honest effort to give entry-level buyers more
than basic transportation.
</P>
<P>
   2000 PONTIAC SUNFIRE GT
</P>
<P>
   Test vehicle: 2000 Pontiac Sunfire GT front-drive coupe
</P>
<P>
   Price as tested: $18,600 (base: $16,210, plus $510 delivery)
</P>
<P>
   Drivetrain: 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine with 16 valves (150
horsepower), five-speed manual overdrive transmission
</P>
<P>
   Safety features: dual front air bags, side-impact beams, power
anti-lock brakes
</P>
<P>
   Options on test vehicle: package with 200-watt, eight-speaker
stereo, power mirrors and windows, keyless entry, cruise control,
$1,325; power sunroof, $555
</P>
<P>
   EPA figures: 23 mpg regular unleaded city, 33 mpg highway

 &HT;    Meat becoming misty memory at our dinner table
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Tony Roma's, long did I lust for you.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know what made me so covetous. Maybe it was the animal
in me as inheritor of the cave and the club. You specialize in
Flintstones food _ ribs _ meat off the bone. Such a primal feast.
Is this not why we have canine teeth?
</P>
<P>
   And now that you're in Waco, Tony, our love affair will never
be. Given a choice of meat or my family, I chose the latter, and
we're getting along just fine.
</P>
<P>
   My oldest son gave up meat almost three years ago. About a year
ago, after researching her son's vegetarian inclination, my wife
gave up meat, too. Her motivation was part nutrition, part animal
cruelty. Whatever, it stuck.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves two omnivores in the family, little brother and big
Daddy. But we rarely eat meat in any context because we've become
accustomed to doing without it. I will not swear off flesh, for no
other reason than I will not alter my chili, and I reserve for my
future an occasional burger or bratwurst with kraut. But by and
large I can get by without meat, and will.
</P>
<P>
   More and more families we know are just like us, with one or
more no-meat eaters. Commonly it is the young people swearing it
off and parents figuring out they don't need it either. Often,
adults who get accustomed to a low-fat diet come to realize they
have gone neo-vegetarian.
</P>
<P>
   How to account for Monday's Associated Press report that for the
first time since the 1980s meat consumption is going up, rather
than down? I don't know. I just know a whole bunch of families that
haven't been contributing to that trend.
</P>
<P>
   Navigating the meatless lifestyle has been an adventure, such as
finding substitutes that simulate some of life's staples.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, one of the things our son missed when he swore off
meat was chicken noodle soup. His mother went looking for a
meatless substitute broth and found it. Now his occasional craving
is for fake chicken _ or ficken _ soup.
</P>
<P>
   Morningstar Farms has found itself a niche in producing meatlike
entrees out of vegetable matter. It does burgers and sausages and
fake hot wings.
</P>
<P>
   This Thanksgiving, though, when she graciously committed herself
to preparing turkey for the flesh eaters in the family, my wife
looked high and low for something she'd read about in the paper _
tofu turkey _ for the others. Her search for tofurkey was in vain.
</P>
<P>
   I was waiting for this product, and wondering if someone had
figured out how to fake giblets.
</P>
<P>
   I have spent a lot of time in the last two years poring over can
labels looking for traces of meat in food. It's amazing how often
something that needn't have it _ vegetable soup, for instance _ has
beef or chicken by-products smuggled into it.
</P>
<P>
   The food industry seems to be largely oblivious to the fact that
more and more people just won't eat meat.
</P>
<P>
   As frustrating as shopping is, even more frustrating are
restaurants that give nary a thought to the fact that many
customers don't want meat. Too often, for many non-meat eaters, the
choice comes down to baked potatoes and salads.
</P>
<P>
   And fast-food? Get real. One of the savviest moves in the
industry was Wendy's introduction of pitas a couple of years ago.
Not only did Wendy's tap the quest of many to eat less fat, but for
those who don't eat meat the product was a godsend.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants seem to be missing a lick when they fail to adjust
to the numbers who eat no meat. Here's one family that goes only
where it has options.
</P>
<P>
   As for Tony Roma's, it still sounds appetizing. But it will have
to be ``Fony Romas _ A place for fibs'' to get my whole crew
through the door.

procurement specialists and producers of consumable supplies like
tissue and soaps, is now making its service reachable by hand held
mobile devices. The service is headed by Ravi Kalakota, who has
left teaching duties at Georgia State University to devote full

capability, Kalakota said, Hsupply now allows busy executives to
approve, check the status of, and even place orders for operating
supplies instantly. The company is also developing regional
distribution points to shorten supply lines to customers. Asked if
teaching was now behind him, Kalakota, who now employes 70 people
in his Lake Hearn office, said ``let's say I have taken e-business

 &HT;    Cover your disaster
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Getting slammed by a tornado, or any other natural
disaster, is bad luck. But neglecting common-sense precautions is
bad judgment.
</P>
<P>
   You can deal with emotional trauma later on, if big winds or
other disasters come your way. Now is the time to protect all those
financial arrangements that mean so much to your household.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's tornado season began this month, and the peak dangers
will last through May. After that comes hurricane season. Fires and
burglaries are never out of season.
</P>
<P>
   Such disasters, by definition, are unpredictable. Georgia's
first nasty storm of this season came on Valentine's Day, killing
18 people and destroying more than 450 homes in the far south part
of the state.
</P>
<P>
   It's that unpredictability you want to guard against. ``Some
people are very thorough, but for a lot of us, it's something we
always mean to get around to,'' said Marilyn Self, the American Red
Cross' director of disaster education. ``It's something we'll get
to when we're not quite so busy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the realm of personal finance, the steps are easy to list:
Inventory your possessions. Make sure they are adequately insured.
Safeguard your financial records.
</P>
<P>
   An inventory is crucial _ the record that shows what you own
even if most of it gets blown away.
</P>
<P>
   Your property inventory is the best document you will have if
you need to make a big, comprehensive claim with your insurance
company. If all of your property has blown away, your inventory is
the best proof you can offer to an insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   You should make a visual record, photographs or a videotape, of
every room in the house. Don't forget to record the contents of
cabinets and closets. ``Many times, people underestimate their
claims because they just don't remember all the things they have,''
Self said.
</P>
<P>
   The visual record is a supplement to written lists. It may help
if you organize and build your list room-by-room.
</P>
<P>
   If you need a kick-start, check the resource list for Internet
sites that will help get you organized. Another alternative is in
personal finance software, such as Quicken, that includes an
inventory section.
</P>
<P>
   Pay particular attention to expensive items, such as antiques,
collectibles, electronics and appliances. For them, record purchase
dates and prices, plus serial numbers or appraisals where
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be careless about preserving your inventory. ``We suggest
keeping it not in your house but in an extremely safe place,'' said
spokesman Dave Colmans of the Georgia Insurance Information
Service. Safe-deposit boxes are the first choice, though some
people send this record to out-of-town family members.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance _ getting it or upgrading it _ is the second step.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important point is to make sure your coverage has
kept up with the cost of your property,'' Colmans said.
</P>
<P>
   To keep up with inflation in housing prices, many homeowners pay
extra fees to get replacement value coverage on their home.
</P>
<P>
   That goes for contents as well the house. ``Otherwise, your
coverage will be what amounts to depreciated costs,'' said Colmans.
``Your television is worth almost nothing after five years, for
example.''
</P>
<P>
   Note that insurance policies usually set limits on how much they
will pay for losses of jewelry, fine art, camera equipment or
computers. If you have more than the limit, ask about the cost of
extra coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Renters should recognize that the landlord's insurance covers
his building, not your apartment full of property. Only one in four
renters has bothered with insuring his or her goods, which is a
mistake. ``We saw a real increase in interest after that day last
year when there were lightning strikes and apartment buildings were
burning in several places on the same day,'' Colmans observed.
</P>
<P>
   Flood insurance doesn't come with basic homeowners and renters
policies. You'll have to buy that extra, if flooding is a
possibility on your property.
</P>
<P>
   On auto insurance, comprehensive coverage is what pays for
storm, fire or flood damage. You may also want a provision to pay
for a rental car while yours is being repaired.
</P>
<P>
   Preserving your records is relatively simple, though it may
require you to make extra copies of crucial paperwork. Some items
go into an evacuation box; others go to a safe-deposit box.
</P>
<P>
   The evacuation box is a sturdy container at home, one you can
snatch up and take with you. Documents should be filed in
waterproof plastic bags.
</P>
<P>
   A safe-deposit box is for papers and computer backups that you
can't afford to lose but don't expect to need immediately. Your
household inventory records go there, along with stock
certificates, perhaps some keepsakes and all the items on the
checklist.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few more items to consider:
</P>
<P>
   _ An emergency fund. The traveler's checks in your evacuation
box will get you into a motel. Thoughtful people often stash away a
larger amount of savings, often enough to cover three months of
living expenses, in case of job losses or other disasters. A
tornado might well qualify.
</P>
<P>
   _ A where-everything-is list. This would tell your family the
locations of bank accounts and other assets, wills, documents
stating your last wishes, insurance policies and persons to
contact. Your list typically should be left with an attorney or
trusted family member.
</P>
<P>
   _ Medications. If there are some you truly can't live without,
it's best to keep a small supply away from your home.
</P>
<P>
   _ A good book on the basics is Janet Bamford's ``Smarter
Insurance Solutions.'' It costs $19.95. You can order it by calling
(800) 233-4830.
</P>
<P>
   _ For a useful pamphlet with detailed advice, go to www.nefe.org
and search for ``Before Disaster Strikes.'' Or call the American
Red Cross at (404) 876-3302.

 &HT;    Pontiac Sunfire GT not lacking in spirit
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The ``pocket rocket'' segment of the auto market is
supposed to be history because of changing tastes, safety concerns
and fuel costs, but Pontiac blithely soldiers on with its Sunfire
GT, a spirited sprinter with attitude.
</P>
<P>
   The latter comes from an aggressive front end with low-slung fog
lamps, aero body-side trim and a teensy rear spoiler. Lively
performance comes from a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine worth 150
horsepower and 155 pounds-feet of torque mated to a smooth
German-built, five-speed Getrag shifter.
</P>
<P>
   The Sunfire, with a base price of $14,420, is Pontiac's
entry-level offering, but the numbers move on up to $16,210 for the
GT and $21,610 for the GT convertible. The EPA labels the coupe and
droptop a subcompact but gives the $14,010 four-door a compact tag.
Either way, it's a small car.
</P>
<P>
   The Sunfire GT is fun, though, as long as you stay away from
speed limits _ the GT's not a stealth machine _ and heavy traffic.
It gives good road feel with enough steering-wheel feedback to
satisfy drivers who decry numbed-down steering. The
performance/economy compromise is a good one with the GT pegged at
23 mpg regular unleaded in the city and 33 on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Pontiac's efforts to upscale the Sunfire, it is
essentially a pumped-up Chevrolet Cavalier _ so, in coupe guise,
that means it's your basic two-adult car. Sitting in the rear is no
fun, but, hey, the entire rear seat back does fold down to provide
good cargo room. (It doesn't lock, not even on convertibles, which
can be an irritant).
</P>
<P>
   Few cars come with more options than the Sunfire, which does
make it possible to cater to individual tastes. The youth market,
which the Sunfire targets, is certain to appreciate the 200-watt,
eight-speaker Monsoon stereo system that tops the list of audio
offerings. A point Pontiac pushed is the RDS, or Radio Data
Systems, receiver that displays secondary signals on the FM band.
It'll identify stations and the format and pick up other text
messages such as weather forecasts, sports scores and even name
that tune.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the GT does lack the refinement of some of its
competitors. It's a bit of a throwback, sure, but give Pontiac
credit for making an honest effort to give entry-level buyers more
than basic transportation.
</P>
<P>
   2000 PONTIAC SUNFIRE GT
</P>
<P>
   Test vehicle: 2000 Pontiac Sunfire GT front-drive coupe
</P>
<P>
   Price as tested: $18,600 (base: $16,210, plus $510 delivery)
</P>
<P>
   Drivetrain: 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine with 16 valves (150
horsepower), five-speed manual overdrive transmission
</P>
<P>
   Safety features: dual front air bags, side-impact beams, power
anti-lock brakes
</P>
<P>
   Options on test vehicle: package with 200-watt, eight-speaker
stereo, power mirrors and windows, keyless entry, cruise control,
$1,325; power sunroof, $555
</P>
<P>
   EPA figures: 23 mpg regular unleaded city, 33 mpg highway

   MBA-TREND _ MBA students at Emory worked with CNN to develop and
refine the Turner South concept that finally went on the air. Can
show the relation between live experiences like that and new kind
of business school graduate. With Turner, Emory voices, including
students. Can do for Wednesday. (Holsendolph, Atlanta

   DELTA-COM _ ITC DeltaCom has announced a deal in which the
company can use IBM to provide customers with Internet support,
including the capability of sending certified mail via the Net. The
service will be provided through e-DeltaCom, the new company
created recently by West Point-based ITC DeltaCom to focus on data

   and restaurant supplies is expanding its service to reach
customers on the move. Hsupply.com, which brings together
procurement specialists and producers of consumable supplies like
tissue and soaps, is now making its service reachable by hand held
mobile devices. The service is headed by Ravi Kalakota, who has
left teaching duties at Georgia State University to devote full
time to developing the new web site. With the new wireless
capability, Kalakota said, Hsupply now allows busy executives to
approve, check the status of, and even place orders for operating
supplies instantly. The company is also developing regional
distribution points to shorten supply lines to customers. Asked if
teaching was now behind him, Kalakota, who now employes 70 people
in his Lake Hearn office, said ``let's say I have taken e-business
research to another stage, and we plan to devote the better part of
the next 10 years refining procurement sites like Hsupply.''

   DEATH-ROW (San Francisco) _ Death row inmate Darrell Rich will
not be allowed to participate in a Native American sweat lodge
ceremony to purify his soul before his scheduled execution early
Wednesday. By JIM HERRON ZAMORA.
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-HOUSING (San Francisco) _ Citing California's tightening
housing market, a coalition of state business, labor, housing
advocates and legislators are pushing legislation that would
increase affordable housing in the state's high job growth areas.
By RICHARD PAOLI.
</P>
<P>
   LEAP-CHAIR (San Francisco) _ Basketball coach Bobby Knight likes
to throw them, executives like to spin in them as they count their
money, and TV stars like to have sex in them _ at least during
``sweeps'' months. But chairs are rarely a hot topic for
watercooler chats. Mostly they just sort of sit in the background.
A $35 million chair may change all that. That's how much it cost
Steelcase to design its Leap chair, a four-year project aimed at
changing the basic foundation of the office chair. By DAVE MURPHY.
</P>
<P>
   POLITICAL NEWS (``p'' category)
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-CALIF (San Francisco) _ That California voters so strongly
embraced several Republican-backed ballot initiatives is a reminder
of just how conservative voters in the Golden State can be. This is
the state, after all, of Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon, the state
that overwhelmingly rejected affirmative action, shut off services
to illegal immigrants, and snubbed gay and lesbian marriages. This
may be good news for Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive
Republican presidential nominee. By ZACHARY COILE and ROBERT
SALLADAY.
</P>
<P>
   LIFESTYLE/FEATURES (``l'' category)
</P>
<P>
   HERBAL-REMEDIES (San Francisco) _ The California Department of
Health is warning that herbal remedies may be toxic. The agency has
found dozens of imported herbal products contaminated with lead,
mercury, arsenic or dangerous chemicals. And it has identified
cases in which mishandled or mislabeled ingredients led to
life-threatening injuries and deaths. By ERIN McCORMICK.
</P>
<P>
   FOOD (``d'' category)
</P>
<P>
   FOOD-WINE-WEEK (Undated) _ This week's featured wine, the 1997
Ravenswood ``Napa Valley'' Zinfandel, costs about $15.99, and the
price tag is quite reasonable for a wine of this quality. By
MICHAEL LONSFORD. (For release Friday, March 17.)
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL (``t'' category)
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-COLUMN (Houston) _ Every day has cause for jubilation in
Louisiana. And this year is no different. The emphasis in 2000 is
on the rich musical heritage of a state that has produced Louis
``Satchmo'' Armstrong and Britney Spears, Mahalia Jackson and Tim
McGraw, Fats Domino and Harry Connick Jr. By HARRY SHATTUCK.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ If you've been hearing the latest
stuff about computers taking over the world, and you're worried
your iMac might conspire with your Palm Pilot and murder you in the
night, I suggest you take a vacation and do some reading. By ROB
MORSE.
</P>
<P>
   SALTER-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ I figure a lot of you might have
heard about the anti-gay marriage ballot measure, known as the
Knight Initiative, which voters just enacted, overwhelmingly, out
here in California. I figure this because my mother (who lives in
Indiana) told me that Don Imus (who lives in New York) talked about
the proposition (22) on his daily radio-TV show. Mom said Imus
thought Californians were pretty mean-spirited to make such a big
deal out of denying lesbians and gays the right to
officially-recognized coupledom, or marriage. By STEPHANIE SALTER.
</P>
<P>
   GUERRILLA-SCIENCE (Medford, N.J.) _ Actor Christopher Reeve is a
proponent of it. Michael J. Fox recently announced his retirement
from a hit TV series to become a full-time activist for it. A
number of individuals and families affected by amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS), or Lou Gehrig's Disease, have started their own
initiatives on its various fronts. ``It'' has been called
``guerrilla science''_ a war on incurable, often deadly, diseases.
Though the terms are ilitaristic, the goals are to save, not take,
lives. By DALE O'REILLEY.

 &HT;    FIRMS TRY TECHNO-SPORTS TO BOLSTER SCIENCE AND MATH
 &HT;    1130&AMP;add. With BOTBALL-WEB. Moving in (w) Washington and (f)
financial categories for release Sunday, March 19.

<P>
   SILVER SPRING, Md. _ Hundreds of Botball fans roared in the
bleachers as foot-high robots created by teens and pre-teens
scattered pingpong balls across a white tabletop.
</P>
<P>
   ``If every science classroom had this level of enthusiasm, we'd
be turning out world-class scientists by the dozens,'' said Lou
Mayo, a planetary scientist who works for Raytheon Corp. at the
Goddard Space Flight Center.
</P>
<P>
   His firm and Goddard are among the many employers testing the
notion that techno-sports can lure the next generation of workers
into studying more science and math.
</P>
<P>
   On each Botball table, kid-built robots that looked like
souped-up Mars rovers crashed into each other, retreated, twisted
and surged forward. The machines scored points by clambering onto a
slab of plastic foam or reaching up to sweep the correct color of
pingpong balls from an array on an overhead shelf.
</P>
<P>
   The robots started, operated and stopped themselves without
remote controls. They were designed, built and programmed by teams
from middle schools and high schools in the Baltimore-Washington
area.
</P>
<P>
   After each 90-second match, winners and losers in last weekend's
regional tournament scurried back to the kids-only pit area at the
other end of the gym.
</P>
<P>
   Parents, teachers and coaches hovered nervously behind the
velvet-covered ropes around the pit area. They watched some
students settle down at laptop computers to tweak programs in the
robots' computers and recalculate friction formulas. Others changed
gear ratios, recharged batteries and replaced parts that had broken
off.
</P>
<P>
   After six hours, The Claw, a robot created at North Bethesda
Middle School in Montgomery County, Md., ended up in second place
behind LegoMyRobot(cq), a pair of robots from Thomas Jefferson, a
science high school in Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   At a post-victory news conference, David Sibert, 18, of
Alexandria, said, ``I think we won because we didn't build one big
robot. We used our parts to make a pair of simple, sturdy robots,
each with one simplified task.''
</P>
<P>
   His team won a trip to Austin, Texas, in August for the national
finals at the convention of the American Association for Artificial
Intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Seven weeks before the regional showdown, sponsors bought each
team a Tupperware tub full of loose plastic and metal parts, wire,
batteries, motors and light-reading sensors. Each tub also held two
unprogrammed computers _ a tiny RCX embedded in a Lego brick and a
mousetrap-sized Handy Board, which can control more motors and
sensors than the RCX.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors said they chipped in roughly $2,000 per team in order
to create good will, support education and enlarge their pool of
potential employees.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Nurvala of the Northern Virginia Technology Council said
that on occasion, a sponsor will offer a summer internship to one
of its players.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we don't want the kids to drop out of school and go to
work for our members right away,'' he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do want them to think about taking the right kind of
courses,'' he said, such as advanced algebra, trigonometry,
calculus and physics.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will prepare them for all sorts of careers with a
technology component, even if they don't go into programming or
building space vehicles,'' Nurvala said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Education Department, senior researcher Clifford Adelman
said, ``Algebra 2 will get you into college, and research shows
that going one step beyond algebra 2 will double the odds that you
will earn a bachelor's degree.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet pollsters confirm the paradox that while most youngsters
want to go to college, a high percentage of the students with those
dreams want to stop taking math and science as soon as they can.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some schools, particularly in poor areas, don't even
offer the most challenging courses.
</P>
<P>
   And with the advent of state-mandated tests, principals often
want their teachers to concentrate on preparing students for those
basic exams.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the nation's biggest and best-known high tech firms _
IBM, GTE, Intel, Cisco, BellSouth and others _ have been working
directly on those problems for years. The firms and related
foundations subsidize educational experiments and try to influence
state and federal policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're interested in re-inventing education,'' said Robin
Willner, director of corporate social policy at IBM Corp. ``We want
every student to learn enough math and science to cope with the
modern world, whether they work for us, are our customers or are
citizens contributing to strong, stable communities.''
</P>
<P>
   However, reformers haven't detected much change. For example,
only about 16 percent of high school students take four years of
science and math.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel and Cisco and Microsoft: We're all dabbling in this, but
we don't know what to do,'' complained Craig Barrett, president and
chief executive officer of Intel. He estimated that his firm alone
spends more than $100 million on education efforts each year.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Gordon, author of ``Skill Wars: Winning the Battle for
Productivity and Profit,'' said, ``If we did have enough young
people interested in becoming chip makers, aerospace designers,
photocopy machine repair workers and electricians, we'd still lack
the schools to train them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sidestepping the hassle over curricular content, many
technology-oriented businesses and trade associations are offering
more support to after-school activities like Botball.
</P>
<P>
   The fast-growing techno-sport began in Florida in 1997. It is
governed by the KISS Institute for Practical Robotics, a national
professional group that recently moved its headquarters to the
University of Oklahoma. KISS is derived from the slogan ``Keep it
simple, stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years earlier, a nonprofit group in Manchester, N.H.,
called FIRST started another national robotics competition, in
which high school students pair up with engineers from corporations
or universities to build heavy-duty robots weighing up to 400
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   FIRST means ``for inspiration and recognition of science and
technology.'' Its cable-televised finals will be conducted at
Disney World in Orlando, Fla., in June.
</P>
<P>
   For youngsters 12 through 19 who prefer virtual reality, the
worldwide ThinkQuest (cq) competition provides an opportunity to
join international teams that use the Internet to build Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   With finals to be held this November in Cairo, Egypt, ThinkQuest
offers more than $1 million in scholarships and prizes for creators
of educational Web sites in five categories: arts and literature,
science and mathematics, sports and health, social sciences and
interdisciplinary.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good way for employers to target students,'' said
Maudie Hampden, 16, a freshman at Simon's Rock College in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   She was still studying at Orlando's Edgewater High School last
year when she, a girl from India and a boy from the Netherlands won
$25,000 apiece for their Web site on electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Hampden doubts that ThinkQuest could be integrated into the high
school curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes too intense an effort to expect it of anyone in
school, even in a design curriculum,'' Hampden said. ``We three
each had to work literally hundreds of hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Working on the Web site taught her ``networking skills and team
dynamics, and leadership in allotting work loads in different time
zones,'' Hampden said. She and one teammate, Alok Ladsaria (cq) of
Bombay, ``are working on a business plan for a start-up to create
multimedia educational tools for the Internet.''

velvet-covered ropes around the pit area. They watched some
students settle down at laptop computers to tweak programs in the
robots' computers and recalculate friction formulas. Others changed
gear ratios, recharged batteries and replaced parts that had broken
off.
</P>
<P>
   After six hours, The Claw, a robot created at North Bethesda
Middle School in Montgomery County, Md., ended up in second place
behind LegoMyRobot(cq), a pair of robots from Thomas Jefferson, a
science high school in Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   At a post-victory news conference, David Sibert, 18, of
Alexandria, said, ``I think we won because we didn't build one big
robot. We used our parts to make a pair of simple, sturdy robots,
each with one simplified task.''
</P>
<P>
   His team won a trip to Austin, Texas, in August for the national
finals at the convention of the American Association for Artificial
Intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Seven weeks before the regional showdown, sponsors bought each
team a Tupperware tub full of loose plastic and metal parts, wire,
batteries, motors and light-reading sensors. Each tub also held two
unprogrammed computers _ a tiny RCX embedded in a Lego brick and a
mousetrap-sized Handy Board, which can control more motors and
sensors than the RCX.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors said they chipped in roughly $2,000 per team in order
to create good will, support education and enlarge their pool of
potential employees.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Nurvala of the Northern Virginia Technology Council said
that on occasion, a sponsor will offer a summer internship to one
of its players.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we don't want the kids to drop out of school and go to
work for our members right away,'' he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do want them to think about taking the right kind of
courses,'' he said, such as advanced algebra, trigonometry,
calculus and physics.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will prepare them for all sorts of careers with a
technology component, even if they don't go into programming or
building space vehicles,'' Nurvala said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Education Department, senior researcher Clifford Adelman
said, ``Algebra 2 will get you into college, and research shows
that going one step beyond algebra 2 will double the odds that you
will earn a bachelor's degree.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet pollsters confirm the paradox that while most youngsters
want to go to college, a high percentage of the students with those
dreams want to stop taking math and science as soon as they can.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some schools, particularly in poor areas, don't even
offer the most challenging courses.
</P>
<P>
   And with the advent of state-mandated tests, principals often
want their teachers to concentrate on preparing students for those
basic exams.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the nation's biggest and best-known high tech firms _
IBM, GTE, Intel, Cisco, BellSouth and others _ have been working
directly on those problems for years. The firms and related
foundations subsidize educational experiments and try to influence
state and federal policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're interested in re-inventing education,'' said Robin
Willner, director of corporate social policy at IBM Corp. ``We want
every student to learn enough math and science to cope with the
modern world, whether they work for us, are our customers or are
citizens contributing to strong, stable communities.''
</P>
<P>
   However, reformers haven't detected much change. For example,
only about 16 percent of high school students take four years of
science and math.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel and Cisco and Microsoft: We're all dabbling in this, but
we don't know what to do,'' complained Craig Barrett, president and
chief executive officer of Intel. He estimated that his firm alone
spends more than $100 million on education efforts each year.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Gordon, author of ``Skill Wars: Winning the Battle for
Productivity and Profit,'' said, ``If we did have enough young
people interested in becoming chip makers, aerospace designers,
photocopy machine repair workers and electricians, we'd still lack
the schools to train them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sidestepping the hassle over curricular content, many
technology-oriented businesses and trade associations are offering
more support to after-school activities like Botball.
</P>
<P>
   The fast-growing techno-sport began in Florida in 1997. It is
governed by the KISS Institute for Practical Robotics, a national
professional group that recently moved its headquarters to the
University of Oklahoma. KISS is derived from the slogan ``Keep it
simple, stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years earlier, a nonprofit group in Manchester, N.H.,
called FIRST started another national robotics competition, in
which high school students pair up with engineers from corporations
or universities to build heavy-duty robots weighing up to 400
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   FIRST means ``for inspiration and recognition of science and
technology.'' Its cable-televised finals will be conducted at
Disney World in Orlando, Fla., in June.
</P>
<P>
   For youngsters 12 through 19 who prefer virtual reality, the
worldwide ThinkQuest (cq) competition provides an opportunity to
join international teams that use the Internet to build Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   With finals to be held this November in Cairo, Egypt, ThinkQuest
offers more than $1 million in scholarships and prizes for creators
of educational Web sites in five categories: arts and literature,
science and mathematics, sports and health, social sciences and
interdisciplinary.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good way for employers to target students,'' said
Maudie Hampden, 16, a freshman at Simon's Rock College in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   She was still studying at Orlando's Edgewater High School last
year when she, a girl from India and a boy from the Netherlands won
$25,000 apiece for their Web site on electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Hampden doubts that ThinkQuest could be integrated into the high
school curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes too intense an effort to expect it of anyone in
school, even in a design curriculum,'' Hampden said. ``We three
each had to work literally hundreds of hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Working on the Web site taught her ``networking skills and team
dynamics, and leadership in allotting work loads in different time
zones,'' Hampden said. She and one teammate, Alok Ladsaria (cq) of
Bombay, ``are working on a business plan for a start-up to create
multimedia educational tools for the Internet.''

 &HT;     By ROB MORSE

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If you have been hearing the latest stuff about
computers taking over the world, and you are worried your iMac
might conspire with your Palm Pilot and murder you in the night, I
suggest you take a vacation and do some reading.
</P>
<P>
   You could buy the latest issue of Wired and read ``Why the
Future Doesn't Need Us,'' by Sun Microsystems co-founder Bill Joy,
who contends that the human race is threatened by advances in
robotics, nanotechnology and genetic engineering.
</P>
<P>
   Or you could read something much better written and more
prescient. Go on line or, better, go to a real bookstore and find a
short story by E.M. Forster called ``The Machine Stops.''
</P>
<P>
   The author of ``A Passage to India'' and ``A Room With a View''
wrote this science fiction story in 1909, and it presents a much
more interesting technological dystopia (a utopia you don't want)
than the one nearly a hundred years later in Wired.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, you don't have to put up with Joy's
self-absorption (he's lived in Aspen for the last decade, after
all) and his name-dropping. One day there may be computers as
intelligent as humans, but I doubt there ever will be computers as
egocentric.
</P>
<P>
   Joy is selling us the idea that computers could self-replicate
and take control of the world, or genetically engineered diseases
could kill us. He begins his argument by dropping the most
attention-getting name of all.
</P>
<P>
   He quotes mad bomber Theodore Kaczynski, who wrote in his
manifesto that computer systems could become so powerful that human
beings will be incapable of making the decisions to keep them
running.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that stage the machines will be in effective control,''
wrote Kaczynski. ``People won't be able to just turn the machines
off, because they will be so dependent on them that turning them
off would amount to suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost a century ago the gentle Forster was far ahead of both
Kaczynski and Joy.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Machine Stops,'' which understandably has a modern cult
following, Forster created a future world in which human beings
live underground in small rooms, hardly moving from their chairs,
their comfort perfectly maintained by the Machine man has invented.
</P>
<P>
   People are isolated, but communicate instantaneously with each
other all over the world, as they do on the Internet now. They can
adjust the light or climate in their rooms simply by speaking, just
as Bill Gates does in his dumb ``smart'' mansion. They've come to
hate nature. They worship the Machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We created the Machine, but we cannot make it do our will
now,'' says one of Forster's characters, a rebellious one.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the Machine stops, dooming those who have become
dependent upon it.
</P>
<P>
   As Forster wrote, ``beautiful naked man was dying, strangled in
the garments he had woven.''
</P>
<P>
   If that's too 1909 poetic for you, think of those garments as a
2000 web of electrons.
</P>
<P>
   Some people survive Forster's dystopia, though _ those who
rejected the Machine and were sentenced to live above ground.
Intriguingly enough, those inheritors of the Earth are called the
Homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Joy recognizes that technological dystopias are hardly new, and
cites science fiction by Ray Bradbury and Kurt Vonnegut (but not
Forster's technological dystopia, one of the earliest). Joy
realizes that utopian techies will accuse him of being a Luddite,
despite his credentials as an ``architect of computer systems.''
</P>
<P>
   A builder of the Machine, in other words.
</P>
<P>
   His argument is that the human race can make itself obsolete
through the combination of genetic engineering, robotics and the
ability to engineer at the molecular level. To the threat of
nuclear weapons, we can add the threat of self-replicating plagues
or machines.
</P>
<P>
   Joy calls these instruments of ``knowledge-based mass
destruction,'' or KMD. He advocates the voluntary
``relinquishment'' by scientists of dangerous genetic,
nanotechnological and robotic (GNR) research, much as the United
States unilaterally renounced the development of biological
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   This may be hard, as Joy recognizes, because most GNR research
is done by highly competitive private companies. This is 2000, and
let's be realistic. The value of those companies' stock is more
important than the theoretical survival of our species.
</P>
<P>
   Is the human race threatened by what goes on in the flat
buildings of the Silicon Valley? The human race is always thinking
of some way to kill itself, so it's not a bad worry.
</P>
<P>
   So far, computer technology has mainly endangered our wrists,
our eyesight and, in the Silicon Valley, the ability to buy a home
at a reasonable price. Those who reject the Machine are threatened
with homelessness, as Forster foresaw.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe that devices that crash all the time can
get organized enough to make us obsolete. The fears raised by Joy
may be the ultimate arrogance of the computer technician _ that
he's helped create what could be Doomsday Machine 5.0.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, we don't know where technology is going. All we
know is that new technology is coming, and humans are pre-wired to
first fear it, then accept it, no matter how awful it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Machine develops _ but not on our lies,'' as Forster
wrote. ``The Machine proceeds _ but not to our good.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, I'm not shooting my balky iMac quite yet.
</P>

SOUTH DAKOTA, OTHER STATES BRUTALIZE PROBLEM CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is

(gm) 
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   c.2000 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   Being
tough on crime has become an excuse to brutalize children.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rehabilitation of juvenile offenders is no longer the goal,
punishment is. Teen-agers have been beaten, abused, raped,
impregnated and sometimes even killed by guards in state detention
centers around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Currently there are investigations of such abuses in Maryland,
Georgia, Delaware, Texas, Illinois, California, Louisiana,
Virginia, Florida, Arizona and South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Virginia's Juvenile Justice Director Gerald Glenn
instituted training in new kicking and striking techniques for
officers in the state's eight juvenile detention centers. The
officers were trained to use the ``whip kick,'' ``elbow strike,''
``shin rake,'' ``instep stomp'' and ``forearm body blow'' against
juveniles they think pose a threat. The new philosophy sanctions
the striking of children in custody.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia's Department of Juvenile Justice came under scrutiny
last year for the death of a 16-year-old retarded boy who died
while in restraints in a youth detention center in Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia is closing its paramilitary boot camps after the U.S.
Department of Justice rebuked the state, calling the camps ``not
only ineffective but harmful'' to the juveniles in custody.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's boot camps aren't the only ones investigated for
brutalizing children. South Dakota's juvenile corrections system
and its boot camps are currently under scrutiny by the Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   In South Dakota, even ``children in need of supervision''
(CHINS) have been placed under the control of the Department of
Corrections for such ``offenses'' as truancy, running away from
home and poor grades. These children _ some as young as 13 _ have
been placed in boot camps and mistreated.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1999, Gina Score, a 226-pound, 14-year-old girl was
forced to run 2.7 miles at the boot camp Plankinton on her first
day at the corrections facility. She collapsed and died of
hyperthermia. She had been left lying in the sun for more than
three hours before an ambulance was called to take her to a
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Investigations into this incident uncovered other abuses at the
Plankinton boot camp. Several girls were forced to run in shackles
until their ankles bled.
</P>
<P>
   A guard put a handcuff over his fist and punched a teen-age boy
in the face, breaking the child's tooth. The boy was in restraints
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The Argus Leader, the Sioux Falls newspaper, in November
reported on a number of incidents at the State Training School at
Plankinton, which includes the boot camp: ``Teen-age girl inmates
strip-searched by male guards. Others sprayed with pepper spray
while naked. Still others handcuffed spread-eagled to beds.''
</P>
<P>
   The story failed to report that other teen-age girls had their
clothes cut off by male guards while they were spread-eagled in
handcuffs. According to one parent, her daughter was blindfolded so
she couldn't recognize the guards involved.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. William Janklow, who created the boot camps in South Dakota
after he took office in 1995, calls these incidents a problem with
``rogue guards.'' In an interview with the Argus Leader, Janklow
claimed he ``never ever had an inkling'' about the problems at
Plankinton.
</P>
<P>
   But the boot camp in Plankinton isn't the only problem in the
juvenile justice system in South Dakota. The boot camp in Custer
also has a record of abusing its teen-age wards. A counselor there
has been accused of molesting six young boys.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the governor nor his spokesman, Bob Mercer, returned
numerous telephone calls requesting an interview last week,
although both were present in the office, according to the
governor's secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Gramkow, a resident of Sioux Falls, frustrated at the
way her 14-year-old daughter had been treated in the Plankinton
facility, began the Parents Who Care Coalition for parents of
children caught up by the state's Department of Corrections.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 130 parents are now active members who are
attempting to educate state legislators about the abuses occurring
in the juvenile justice system in South Dakota. So far, their three
main proposals for legislation have been killed: a children's
rights bill, a parent's rights bill, and a bill that would separate
CHINS from juvenile offenders.
</P>
<P>
   When Gramkow visited her daughter at the Plankinton facility,
she found her daughter had multiple bruises on both arms. One, she
said, looked as if it had been the result of being struck with a
club.
</P>
<P>
   Months later, a group of teen girls in a suicidal rage broke
light bulbs and cut up their arms. The guards merely watched, said
Gramkow. She said one girl attacked her daughter and cut up her
arms and wrists. The girls didn't get medical treatment for their
lacerations for more than four hours.
</P>
<P>
   How did Gramkow's daughter enter the nightmare world of South
Dakota juvenile corrections? She was a runaway. Now she's scarred
for life _ emotionally and physically.
</P>
<P>
   Edith Barden of Spearfish has a 14-year-old granddaughter in the
juvenile corrections system. The granddaughter's crime was truancy
and poor grades in school. The granddaughter's mother, according to
Barden, is an alcoholic and the child would sometimes stay home to
care for her.
</P>
<P>
   From the child's own compassion and love for her mother, she
became a truant and subsequently her grades suffered.
</P>
<P>
   And now she is in a hospital in Yankton because she attempted
suicide after being told she wouldn't be allowed to go home until
she was 21 years old. They can do that in South Dakota _ hold a
child for an indeterminate period of time.
</P>
<P>
   Deb Phillips of Rapid City is the western coordinator for the
Parents Who Care Coalition. Her 13-year-old daughter entered the
juvenile corrections system when she became truant and a runaway.
She was sent to the boot camp in Custer.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Guettler lives in Spearfish. Her daughter was put in the
Juvenile Services Center in Rapid City because she skipped school
and missed 20 days. The Guettlers were forced to sign a paper,
which turned their daughter over to the state, under the threat of
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Guettler's daughter has a drug and alcohol problem. State
corrections officials wanted her in a boot camp, not a treatment
center. The daughter also has a severe ear infection, but the
officials at the Custer boot camp would not allow her to see a
doctor for the problem.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 24, the Youth Law Center filed a class action lawsuit in
a federal district court against the South Dakota Department of
Corrections and the superintendent of the State Training School at
Plankinton. The lawsuit alleges numerous abuses and inhumane
treatment of children while they were in state custody.
</P>
<P>
   On March 6, the international watchdog group Human Rights Watch
sent a letter to Gov. Janklow urging him to take steps to ensure
that state policy respects children's fundamental rights and end
their inhumane treatment.
</P>
<P>
   These stories illustrate the depth and breadth of the problem in
one state. This is how South Dakota treats its problem children.
The governor has been quoted as calling them ``scum.'' And, as the
governor sets the tone of his administration, the children are
treated accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem of the mistreatment of our children is much
deeper and broader than any one state. This nightmare has swept
across our nation.
</P>
<P>
   The brutalization of children in state custody is the product of
a corrupt philosophy _ a philosophy without compassion, without an
understanding of the troubles faced by children, without trust or
respect and without a faith in their potential for rehabilitation.

the United States, is where the problem lies. The country is
undergoing its greatest social and demographic changes in a

changes. Curiously, the oldest man running for president, John
McCain, was the one who most clearly understood the future. But now

</P>
<P>
   ``Super Tuesday'' saw more than just the triumph of the two
establishment candidates. It saw the triumph of the ultimate
establishment: dynasticism. Political dynasties are in retreat in
most of the rest of the world. The Nehrus no longer rule India.
Britain is retiring its hereditary peers. Indonesia has kissed the
Suhartos goodbye. But in the country that was born of a revolution
against George III, the next presidential election will be fought
between two crown princes, George II and Albert II. &QL;

   Art boosters in Texas have long boasted that their state was a

really able to convince New York or California to take them
seriously _ until now. On March 23, the 2000 Biennial Exhibition
opens at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. The show
will feature nine artists from the Lone Star State, the largest
number of Texas artists ever in a Biennial, and the largest from
any one state outside of New York and California. &QL;

   Anyone who thinks this year's American election campaign is

Life of Henry A. Wallace,'' and think again. When Henry Wallace,
Franklin D. Roosevelt's third-term vice president, had the temerity
to break away from the Democratic Party and run on the Progressive
ticket in 1948, he was ruthlessly demonized as a wild-eyed fanatic
bent on destroying the American way of life. &QL;

   For now, there is only one serious candidate left in the running
for the leadership of Germany's Christian Democratic Union (CDU).
After the withdrawal on March 5 of Volker Ruhe, Angela Merkel, the
party's general secretary, has become the hot favorite among the
rank and file. But in the eyes of the CDU leadership and of its
conservative Bavarian sister party, Mrs. Merkel suffers from two
grave drawbacks: she comes from the former communist east, and _
god forbid _ she is a woman. &QL;

<P>
   And then there were two. ``Super Tuesday'' has left America,
predictably, with a choice between Al Gore and George W. Bush. They
won by showing that they are regular party animals. And that, for
the United States, is where the problem lies. The country is
undergoing its greatest social and demographic changes in a
century. Neither political party has come to terms with these
changes. Curiously, the oldest man running for president, John
McCain, was the one who most clearly understood the future. But now
he is gone, and it's back to ``politics as usual.'' &QL;

   Since the death of General Franco in 1975, Spain has been a

whoever wins the general election on March 12. Spain under Jose
Maria Aznar is generally riding high. Politically stable,
economically prosperous, it is gaining respect in the world. Odd,
then, that Aznar is not assured another term. History, it seems,
determines that Spain's heart still beats on the left. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ Nearly half of the ice covering the Arctic has
melted, warns an authoritative report to be published in May.
</P>
<P>
   An alarming disappearance of ice is occurring at both poles and
from glaciers worldwide as global warming proceeds, and in decades
there could be none left at all on the Arctic ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The report, from the Worldwatch Institute, in Washington,
describes how entire ice shelves have already disintegrated in the
Antarctic and how a fifth of the glaciers in the eastern Himalayas
have vanished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earth's ice cover is melting at an astonishing rate,'' it
says. The melting had ``accelerated rapidly'' over the past decade
as more and more polluting ``greenhouse gases'' contaminated the
atmosphere, increasing global warming and preparing the way for
raised sea levels and more flooding.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Government announced a radical program to cut
Britain's emissions of the gases to a level that goes beyond what
is legally required, in an attempt to breathe new life into
faltering international negotiations over combating climate change.
</P>
<P>
   John Prescott, Britain's deputy prime minister, warned of more
disasters, like the recent floods in Mozambique, as global warming
increases.
</P>
<P>
   The Worldwatch report says that every two years an area the size
of Denmark vanishes from the ice sheet that covers the Arctic Ocean
around the North Pole. Meanwhile, the remaining ice has lost nearly
half its thickness.
</P>
<P>
   The overall volume of the ice has shrunk by 40 percent over the
past 30 years, and it could all be gone ``in a matter of decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Three Antarctic ice sheets have ``fully disintegrated'' and two
more are ``expected to break up soon.''
</P>
<P>
   The World Glacier Monitoring Service has also reported
``extreme'' losses of ice from the world's mountains over the past
few years. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Bill Hanlon and Warren Ward were out hunting on a
glacier in the far north of Canada last summer when they stumbled
on a human hip protruding from the ice.
</P>
<P>
   They looked down to see the perfectly preserved body of a
prehistoric man, wearing a cloak made of arctic squirrel skins.
Scattered around him were a walking stick, a wooden spear, a bone
knife, a leather pouch with half-eaten food, and a broad-rimmed
straw hat, just as he had dropped them when he fell into a crevasse
12,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the beginning of the 1990s a different glacier _ this
one just a few yards inside Italy in the Alps _ disgorged another
prehistoric hunter, his shoes stuffed with straw to keep out the
cold.
</P>
<P>
   The icemen have come back to humanity, after thousands of years,
because the glaciers that entombed them are melting all over the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Lester Brown, president of the authoritative Worldwatch
Institute, says: ``Our ancestors are emerging from the ice with a
message for us: Earth is getting warmer.'' This spring his
institute will publish a striking catalogue of the world's
shrinking ice cover.
</P>
<P>
   Glaciers now are smaller than at any time in the past 5,000
years while the ice covers at both poles are melting.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwatch reports that the Arctic ice cap is shrinking by
24,000 sq. km every year. Worse, it is now on average five-foot
thick compared with nine feet just 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall,'' the report says, ``the Arctic sea ice has lost some
40 percent of its volume in less than 30 years. If the melting
continues at this pace, experts predict the ice pack could be gone
in a matter of decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the map of Antarctica has been changed forever over
the past decade as three great ice-sheets _ the Wordie, the Larsen
A and the Prince Gustav shelves _ have disappeared entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Two more _ the Larsen B and the Wilkins shelves _ have lost a
seventh of their combined area in the past 18 months and, the
report says, ``are expected to break up soon.''
</P>
<P>
   The melting of this floating ice, at both poles, will not raise
sea levels since it already displaces the equivalent amount of
water. But there are some signs that land-based ice is disappearing
too.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the southern and eastern edges of the Greenland Ice
Sheet, which contains eight percent of the world's ice, have been
thinning by more than three feet a year for the past six years.
</P>
<P>
   The Antarctic ice cap has so far remained stable. But the Pine
Island Glacier, thought by some scientists to be the key to the
future of the smaller, West Antarctic Ice Sheet, has retreated by
1.2 km a year over the past four years and is thinning by more than
10 feet annually.
</P>
<P>
   If the West Antarctic Ice Sheet were to melt, sea levels around
the world would rise by nearly 20 feet, submerging vast areas of
the land.
</P>
<P>
   One third of the present sea level rise _ between 10 cm and 25
cm over the past century _ has been caused by melting glaciers; the
rest comes from the way the oceans expand as they warm up. They are
increasingly thinning and retreating up the mountainsides.
</P>
<P>
   Glaciers both in the Alps and the Caucasus have lost half their
ice over the past 100 to 150 years. Half of Spain's glaciers have
disappeared, along with two-thirds of those in the Glacier National
Park in Montana in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   And the melting is accelerating. The Gangotri Glacier in the
Himalayas is receding twice as fast as 25 years ago, the Speka
Glacier in Uganda by three times as much. And the Quelccaya Glacier
in the Peruvian Andes is now retreating 10 times as fast as just a
decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   The report estimates that the world could lose up to a quarter
of all its glacier ice by 2050 and half by 2100, leaving the only
large remaining patches in Alaska, Patagonia and the Himalayas.
</P>
<P>
   Already some effects are being felt. The retreat of the
Quelccaya Glacier threatens water supplies for Lima's 10 million
people, while the melting of Himalayan glaciers is leading to
spring floods followed by water scarcity in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   As ice disappears it ceases to reflect heat back into space,
causing global warming to speed up. And scientists increasingly
believe that as more and more fresh water gets into the Atlantic,
the Gulf Stream may be directed southwards, paradoxically making
Britain and northwest Europe very much colder as the rest of the
world heats up.
</P>
<P>
   The melting of the world's ice is only the latest of a host of
signs that global warming is already under way. Eight of the 10
hottest years on record have occurred in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Violent weather, long predicted to accompany the climate change,
is increasing: the amount of damage done by storms in 1998 alone
exceeded the total for the whole of the 1980s and, as the
Independent on Sunday reported last summer, two Pacific islands
have disappeared beneath the waves.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the world dithers. Governments have yet to put the final
touches to the Kyoto Agreement of two years ago, designed to be the
first small step towards cutting back the pollution that causes
global warming.
</P>
<P>
   It is far from certain that they will agree to them at a crucial
meeting in November: the U.S., with 4 percent of the world's people
while producing 20 percent of its carbon dioxide, still shows
little sign of accepting the agreement. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 950, OR CONTINUE TO 1,100WORDS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   For once Britain is in the lead. Last week ministers unveiled
plans to cut Britain's emissions of greenhouse gases by 21.5
percent by the year 2020, almost twice as much as they agreed to
under the Kyoto Agreement, making it the only country in the world
to go further than obliged to do.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days ago British Prime Minister Tony Blair met business
leaders to talk over the practicalities. And Deputy Prime Minister
John Prescott and Environment Minister Michael Meacher, who pushed
through the agreement two and a half years ago, are gearing up to
try to repeat the trick in November.
</P>
<P>
   But still the world is moving at a glacial pace. Perhaps,
environmentalists hope, the news of the speed at which the world is
melting might just break the diplomatic ice. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Plans are being laid for a visit by George W. Bush,
the Republican presidential candidate, to Europe ahead of this
year's election. The aim would be to help him get to know some of
the leading figures on the world stage, but also to reinforce
Bush's stature.
</P>
<P>
   The challengers in the presidential election, irascible and
independent-minded John McCain and the sleepy if smart Bill
Bradley, have now withdrawn. That leaves Republican George W. Bush,
the governor of Texas and Democrat Al Gore, vice president. Both
are mainstream, slightly dull figures with highly-polished
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   As Molly Ivins, doyenne of the Texas press put it last week:
``Oh, pooh, the fun's over.'' Or as Gail Collins put it in the New
York Times, ``Maybe it will be good for our character. It's really
superficial, you know, this desire for a chief executive with
charisma.''
</P>
<P>
   But the race between the two candidates is very close, and Bush
has lost what was a double-digit margin in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is slightly ahead, according to the latest opinion polls.
At 43 percent to 40 percent, according to NBC and the Wall Street
Journal, the gap is within the polls' margin of error; but the
trend is clear.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has a potentially more serious problem: he is simply not
seen as presidential material by many people. When voters were
asked about ``the right experience and the ability to do the job of
president,'' nearly half preferred Gore; less than a third picked
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel battle-tested and that's what a lot of people wanted to
see,'' said Bush last week. ``I think the people saw I could get
whipped and bounce back.'' But he has a broader problem of stature
which the campaign has not resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams are gearing up for the campaign now, with months to
go until the party conventions. Some time before then _ perhaps in
May _ both campaigns are considering international tours, including
visits to Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is already well-known on the international stage; for Bush,
a trip abroad is a more important venture.
</P>
<P>
   In part, it is his evident lack of knowledge of international
affairs that has hurt him. Bush is a fine man, but apparently he
thinks that Canada is run by a plate of chips and cottage cheese.
</P>
<P>
   The governor was campaigning in Michigan when a reporter
delivered the news that the Canadian prime minister, Jean Poutine,
had endorsed him. ``I'm honored,'' said Bush. ``I appreciate his
strong statement. He understands our belief in free trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, the prime minister of Canada is Jean Chretien. Poutine is
a favorite dish of the Quebecois, an unpalatable mess which few
beyond Canada care to sample.
</P>
<P>
   Ignorance of these matters is hardly crippling in itself _ few
Americans take much notice of politics up north, let alone Canadian
cuisine, and the Canadian prankster who tried it on with Bush has
had plenty of success with many other politicians.
</P>
<P>
   The point is that cheap shots at Bush's knowledge of foreign
affairs are becoming all too common.
</P>
<P>
   His uneasy relationship with spoken English does not help.
``When I was coming up, it was a dangerous world and we knew
exactly who the they were. It was us versus them, and it was clear
who them was. Today, we're not so sure who the they are. But we
know they're there,'' he said on one memorable occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is madmen in the world, and there are terror,'' he said
on another.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, by contrast, has little to worry about in terms of the
legacy of the campaign. One of his weaknesses going into the
election was that (like many vice presidents) he had come to be
seen as ineffectual, but the campaign has started to change that.
</P>
<P>
   His fight against Bradley showed him to be tough and
resourceful, even vicious at times. He will be attacked for being
part of President Bill Clinton's administration, but by contrast he
has few weaknesses when it comes to experience.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has relatively little track record in politics by
comparison. He has been governor of Texas since 1994, but the post
carries fewer responsibilities than in many other states. The
state's legislature meets only every other year; it is not an
especially arduous job.
</P>
<P>
   The real problem for Bush is that he seems lightweight. The
jokes and cartoons of him play on the image; one columnist last
week referred to the contest between the two candidates as the
pinhead versus the sleaze, meaning Gore.
</P>
<P>
   While the latter description will please Bush, the former won't.
The Democrats had hoped since last year to paint Bush as an ``Empty
Suit,'' and that view seems to be gaining ground.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, by contrast, may be no John Kennedy but he does at least
have a certain solidity.
</P>
<P>
   Bush ``whined his way through several states yearning for his
family, his dog and his own no-steam shaving mirror back home,''
says columnist Collins. ``Mr. Gore just seems to be real, real good
at enduring discomfort. In the age of indulgence, we've got a stoic
running for president.''
</P>
<P>
   There is one other question about Bush's stature. In the last
twelve presidential elections, the shorter candidate has won only
twice, in 1972 and 1976. Bush is five feet eleven inches, a little
taller in his cowboy boots. Gore is six feet one inch. Even a visit
to see Tony Blair can't change that. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN _ In the wave of half-freedoms that have followed the
recent pro-reformist elections in Iran, the dark and sinister
political role of ex-president Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani _ once
the most powerful man in the Islamic Republic _ is at last being
revealed in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   Rafsanjani, who first disclosed the Iran-Contra scandal, is
being linked to at least six senior Iranian government officials
who, during his presidency, ordered the secret execution of more
than 80 dissidents, intellectuals and criminals.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-president, it now transpires, also appointed members of
his own family to high positions in the lucrative oil ministry in
Iran.
</P>
<P>
   As the political star of Rafsanjani falls through the firmament
_ he has just failed in his attempt to become speaker of the new
parliament _ so the revelations about his 10-year presidency and
its nepotism are being uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   The names of at least seven men with whom he dealt _ some of
whom are said to have issued ``fatwas'' ordering the death of
dozens of innocent Iranians during Rafsanjani's rule _ are known in
Iran but have never been published before.
</P>
<P>
   They include Ali Fallahian, former head of intelligence; Ali
Razini, who was head of judiciary powers in Tehran _ he is now a
member of the ``special'' clergy court; and Mustafa Pourmahamadi,
the former deputy intelligence minister in charge of international
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The ``death squad'' committee also included Ruhollah Hosseinian,
who is currently head of Iran's ``documentation center''; two
ayatollahs _ said to have signed a decree ordering the murder of
``apostates'' _ and Said Emami, the ex-deputy intelligence minister
in charge of ``operational'' affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Emami was found dead _ murdered with a potassium injection _
while in prison for allegedly ordering the murders of intellectuals
during the presidency of Rafsanjani's successor, Mohamed Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   Emami's dispatch occurred only days before his trial in which he
was expected to name the high-ranking murderers. Many in Tehran
believe that Rafsanjani was himself a member of the secret
``killer'' committee.
</P>
<P>
   The murder victims include the translator and writer Saidi
Sirjani, killed by injection in 1994; Ahmed Mirallai, another
writer who was knifed to death; Ahmed Taffozoli, who died in a car
``accident''; and Ibrahim Zalzade, a journalist who was also
knifed.
</P>
<P>
   Also among the murder victims was a middle-aged woman, Fateme
Ghaemmaghami, the mother of three children who was believed to have
been involved with a member of the execution committee.
</P>
<P>
   At least three Sunni Muslim clerics were also liquidated, one of
them knifed to death in Kermanshah. An Armenian Orthodox priest was
also killed after his name appeared on the intelligence ministry
execution list.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the murders were particularly gruesome; at least one
victim is said to have been cut into pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Iranian journalists have already been asking what Rafsanjani
knew about the ``fatwas'' for the execution of intellectuals,
although the Independent is the first newspaper to print the names
of those known to be on the execution committee.
</P>
<P>
   Akbar Gangi, the most prominent investigative journalist in
Tehran, has written a book about the committee _ without giving
names _ called ``The Dungeon of Ghosts'' in which he refers to
another cleric as ``the eminence grise.''
</P>
<P>
   Gangi has already received death threats by phone and fax. ``My
friends have said to me that the only way of protecting myself is
to give an interview,'' he told the Independent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The information I have about the murders is exact and very
sensitive _ 90 to 100 people were killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally earnest if less grave questions are being asked about
Rafsanjani's family.
</P>
<P>
   His son Yasser, it is now clear, worked in the procurement
section of the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) while also
running a private company connected to NIOC. Rafsanjani's nephew,
Ali, was a deputy minister of oil while another son, Mehdi, was
employed in the national gas company, NAFT-va-GAS.
</P>
<P>
   Stories of Rafsanjani's personal wealth _ he is the son of a
pistachio farmer _ have spread throughout Iran and were one reason
for his failure to gain more than 25 percent of the vote in last
month's elections.
</P>
<P>
   He spends several weeks a year in a luxury villa north of Tehran
where gazelles graze amid parkland and hills guarded by special
security police. &QL;

   TEHRAN _ Sunday morning, two men on a 1000cc motorbike _ beloved
by the security services in Iran _ tried to murder the
editor-in-chief of ``Sob e-Emrous'' newspaper which has repeatedly
questioned the activities of former president Ali Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
   Saeed Hajjarian, a member of Tehran's municipal council, was
shot in the face and shoulder. One of the assailants got off his
motorbike to shoot the editor again on the pavement outside his
office but the bullet, lodged in the back of his neck, did not kill
him.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday (Monday), The Independent disclosed the existence of a
``death list'' compiled by senior clerics and intelligence ministry
officials during Rafsanjani's presidency which resulted in the
murder of up to 100 intellectuals, journalists and petty criminals
in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Tehran newspapers have reprinted a garbled version of The
Independent's report _ which included the names of intelligence
officers on the ``death'' committee _ as it appeared in Turkish
newspapers but have otherwise suppressed details of the dispatch.
</P>
<P>
   Hajjarian is a close friend and adviser of the reformist
president, Mohamed Khatami, whose rule was endorsed in last month's
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami personally condemned the attempted assassination Sunday
as the work of ``terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   Hajjarian's columnist Akbar Gangi, the most prominent
investigative journalist in Iran, was quoted in The Independent
last week as asking why Rafsanjani claimed he did not know about
the killings during his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Gangi referred to the ``death list'' officials as ``the Dungeon
of Ghosts'' upon whom light should be thrown in order to establish
their identities.
</P>
<P>
   In Iran, 1000cc motorcycles can only be used, by law, by members
of the security forces.
</P>
<P>
   Like the president's brother Mohamed-Reza _ now the leader of
the largest reformist party in parliament _ Hajjarian was one of
the students who took over the American Embassy in Tehran in 1980.
He was in fact one of the founders of the Intelligence Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Although breathing with the help of a respirator and initially
in a coma, Hajjarian was Sunday night said to be improving but
still in danger.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranian Ministry of Culture, which is in the hands of
Khatami's supporters, said Sunday that Hajjarian's would-be
assassins were ``opponents of freedom'' but that ``bullets cannot
halt the establishment of democracy in Iran.'' President Khatami
said that the gunmen had ``no place among the people.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Dungeon of Ghosts,'' it seems, is still in being. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Warren Buffett, the world's most famous investor,
announced on Saturday that 1999 was his worst year ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the worst absolute performance of my tenure and,
compared to the S&AMP;P, the worst relative performance as well,'' he
said in his famous letter to shareholders, which is full of flashes
of wit and wisdom as usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even Inspector Clouseau could find last year's guilty party:
your chairman.''
</P>
<P>
   Though some of the companies in which Buffett has invested had a
rough year, the main reason for the results lay in his insurance
subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Berkshire Hathaway, his company, is now less an investment
vehicle and more a conglomerate, with the reinsurer General Re and
the car insurance company Geico at its core.
</P>
<P>
   Net earnings for 1999 dropped to $1.557 billion, or $1,025 per
share, from $2.830 billion, or $2,262 per share in 1998. Class A
Berkshire Hathaway shares closed Friday at $41,300 _ the lowest
level since May 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett placed the blame on the company's underperforming equity
investments. ``What most hurt us during the year was the inferior
performance of Berkshire's equity portfolio _ and responsibility
for that portfolio, leaving aside the small piece of it run by Lou
Simpson of Geico, is entirely mine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several of our largest investees badly lagged the market in
1999 because they've had disappointing operating results.''
</P>
<P>
   The main investments _ in American Express, Coca-Cola, the
mortgage company Freddie Mac, Gillette, the Washington Post and
Wells Fargo _ remain virtually the same, with slight reductions in
his holdings of Wells Fargo and Freddie Mac.
</P>
<P>
   His stake in Coca-Cola has plunged in value from $13.4 million
to $11.7 million, while American Express recorded a hefty gain.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the value of his portfolio is roughly unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still like these businesses and are content to have major
investments in them,'' Buffett said. ``But their stumbles damaged
our performance last year, and it's no sure thing that they will
quickly regain their stride.''
</P>
<P>
   But the report makes no reference to Disney, once a core
investment. In 1998, he had 51 million shares in the company worth
$1.5 billion. It is no longer listed among Berkshire's top holdings
with year-end market values of $750 million or more. That means
that he has sold at least half of his stake.
</P>
<P>
   But it is in Berkshire Hathaway's own subsidiaries that the real
problems have occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our per-share investments changed very little, but our
operating earnings, affected by negatives that overwhelmed some
strong positives, fell apart,'' he said. The main factor was a
massive $1.4 billion loss on its reinsurance business, as well as a
big decline on car insurance profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a huge _ and, I believe, aberrational _ underwriting
loss at General Re,'' Buffett said. And he warned: ``We do not
expect our underwriting earnings to improve in any dramatic way
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Berkshire's much-publicized problems have caused a huge drop in
its share price, as investors became concerned that Buffett was
staying out of technology stocks, and rumors spread that he was
ill.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett said that he had relatively modest hopes for the next
few years, compared with the stellar results of the last few
decades when the company outperformed the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Berkshire, truly large superiorities over that index are a
thing of the past. They existed then because we could buy both
businesses and stocks at far more attractive prices than we can
now, and also because we then had a much smaller capital base.''
</P>
<P>
   Buffett once again underlined that the brave new world of tech
stocks was not for him. ``Our problem _ which we can't solve by
studying up _ is that we have no insights into which participants
in the tech field possess a truly durable competitive advantage,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He reiterated that he believed equity prices were vastly
overvalued at the moment and he hinted that a contraction in his
equity investments might be ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the prices of the fine businesses we already own
are just not that attractive. In other words, we feel much better
about the businesses than their stocks.'' &QL;

   PODGORICA _ Montenegro's leaders have issued a stark warning to
the West that their embattled republic is being destabilized by
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic as a pretext for a full-scale
invasion by the Yugoslav army.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the Independent, both the president, Milo
Djukanovic, and the prime minister, Filip Vujanovic, warned of the
dangers of another Balkan conflagration this spring.
</P>
<P>
   But Europe was also urged to lift more of its sanctions against
Yugoslavia as part of a comprehensive strategy to reward the
opposition in Serbia, thereby boosting its internal prestige.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic said that Montenegro is ``very much on the alert''
and warned that Milosevic ``would like to see a nervous move as a
pretext to radicalize this crisis to its end.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From time to time,'' he argued, ``Mr. Milosevic steps up the
crisis and I would say that this is one of his strongest phases.''
</P>
<P>
   In Podgorica the real fear is that an economic noose is being
tightened around them.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Villa Gorica, Montenegro's official government
house, Vujanovic said that Belgrade's ``brutal'' strategy is to use
economic hardship to prompt civil unrest which will provide a fig
leaf for military intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``His intention,'' said Vujanovic ``is to destabilize Montenegro
in two stages: first economically and socially and then he will use
economic and social dissatisfaction, provoking people to go out
into the streets and make demonstrations in which conflicts will
arise.
</P>
<P>
   ``These conflicts could,'' he added, ``be used by Milosevic to
interfere with his army.''
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro remains part of the Yugoslav federation but has
regularly defied Belgrade and even adopted the deutschmark as its
official currency.
</P>
<P>
   In return Milosevic started to choke the economy of the small
republic of around 650,000 people which is reliant on Serbia for 60
percent of its food supplies and 70 percent of its medicines.
</P>
<P>
   Although the standard of living is higher in Montenegro than in
Serbia, attempts to bolster the economy have so far failed.
</P>
<P>
   When Montenegro agreed to open its borders to Albania, Belgrade
responded by setting up regular police blockades of the routes from
Serbia into Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   In another apparent move to intimidate Montenegro, Belgrade has
announced several weeks of military maneuvers and, according to
sources in Podgorica, begun a new round of recruitment into his
paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
   Political instability has again dented Montenegro's hopes of
attracting foreign visitors to its spectacular coastline which once
supported a thriving tourist trade.
</P>
<P>
   In another blow to local hoteliers, Montenegro's adoption of the
deutschmark has made Montenegro too expensive for most Yugoslav
visitors this summer.
</P>
<P>
   With mounting concern about security of the region, Europe gave
its most public demonstration of support for Montenegro on Friday
when Chris Patten, European Commissioner for Foreign Affairs,
became the first western politician to cross the border into
Montenegro since the Kosovo war.
</P>
<P>
   Announcing 5 million euros of new financial support for the
country, Patten said that some of Milosevic's decisions ``suggest
that he is up to his old malign tricks.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Madeleine Albright, the U.S. secretary of state, who met
Djukanovic in Sarajevo last week, Patten is anxious to dissuade
Montenegro from attempting full independence fearing that this
would provoke violent opposition from sections of the population in
the north which is loyal to Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Vujanovic said he was satisfied with assurances, given to the
Montenegran president by Albright, that any Yugoslav invasion would
be resisted by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ``These messages should be reiterated all the time
because they are hard for Milosevic is understand. Even when he
hears them, he forgets.'' &QL;

   The  &UR; New York Times News Service &LR;  is planning an expanded
weather package, with a planned starting date of Monday, March 20,
to be transmitted Sunday, March 19. The package, consisting of a
weather map as a graphics file and a text file to accompany the
map, is available to graphics clients of the News Service.
</P>
<P>
   The new map grows to 4 columns in width (52 picas), from 3, and
is 6 inches deep; the old was 4\ inches deep. This new size permits
the insertion of cloud cover information, previously a separate
map, and the addition of many new cities (see list below).
</P>
<P>
   The map is available both in color and in black and white.
Because the map is much more detailed, we have devised an entirely
new palette of colors to make it easier to read the added
information.
</P>
<P>
   A sample of the new map is available at Wieck, Newscom,
Presslink and AP's GraphicsNet.
</P>
<P>
   A summary of this information is included in each day's Graphics
Budget.

   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ I figure a lot of Americans might have heard
about the anti-gay marriage ballot measure, known as the Knight
Initiative, that voters just enacted, overwhelmingly, in
California.
</P>
<P>
   I figure this because my mother (who lives in Indiana) told me
that Don Imus (who lives in New York) talked about California's
Proposition 22 on his daily radio/TV show.
</P>
<P>
   Mom said Imus thought Californians were pretty mean-spirited to
make such a big deal out of denying lesbians and gays the right to
officially recognized coupledom, or marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said love is love and if people want to get married, we
should let 'em,'' she said. ``It was kind of surprising because the
I-man tends to make fun of just about everybody but the little kids
with cancer who come to his ranch.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, I couldn't agree more with Don Imus. Proposition 22, the
so-called ``definition of marriage'' measure, was a sad, nasty and
totally avoidable exercise in divisiveness.
</P>
<P>
   What I'd ask you folks outside of California to remember,
though, is something most Americans forget when we hear about a
voter referendum passing or failing in somebody else's state:
</P>
<P>
   ``California'' did not vote for Proposition 22.
</P>
<P>
   What happened was that 4,162,017 Californians voted for it.
That's a majority, for sure, and laws are made by majority rule.
But a not-inconsequential number of people punched ``No'' on the
measure _ 2,618,337, to be exact.
</P>
<P>
   As one of those 2.6 million-plus people, I'll be damned if I'll
be lumped in with Californians who feel compelled to tell the world
that, ``Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or
recognized in California.''
</P>
<P>
   Paint all of California with the broad brush of intolerance and
exclusivity, and you paint me and 2,618,336 other like-minded
souls.
</P>
<P>
   You paint a Daly City man named Livius Guiao, who wrote a letter
to the editor: ``I cringe when I think of what the (pro-Proposition
22) message might be.''
</P>
<P>
   You paint a San Francisco man named Charles Burch, who wrote:
``Which group or movement in history do you admire that defined its
own rights on the premise that those same rights should be denied
to others?''
</P>
<P>
   You paint a Santa Rosa woman named Susan Lamont, who wrote that,
thanks to the latest election: ``Now, more than ever, it is
embarrassing to be a Californian.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking umbrage at several of the ballot measures approved last
week, Lamont sarcastically suggested that voters stop pussyfooting
around and do what they really want to do.
</P>
<P>
   For gays, she wrote, ``let's revive the stocks. State Sen. Pete
Knight, R-Palmdale, can throw the first tomato at his own son.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamont was referring to the lawmaker who was responsible for
getting Proposition 22 on the ballot. Four times he had failed to
get such a marriage declaration passed in the state Senate, so he
took his crusade to the voters.
</P>
<P>
   That Knight has a gay son and a gay brother who died of AIDS
caused a lot of people to wish he'd chosen a therapist's office
instead of the March 7 primary election to work out his personal
issues around homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't. And more than 4 million Californians supported
him. So the whole state is stuck, for now, with a ban on same-sex
marriages.
</P>
<P>
   All I'm saying is, before any of you non-Left Coasters think
about boycotting us for our homophobia or _ worse _ decide you
might move here because you HATE gay people and think you've found
Valhalla-by-the-Pacific, don't.
</P>
<P>
   That especially goes for you, Imus.

HIALEAH APPROACHES THE FINISH LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In what is certainly the beginning of the end for storied
Hialeah Park, this season's 63-day Hialeah meeting, which begins
Friday, will be held at Gulfstream Park.
</P>
<P>
   After a week of speculation, Hialeah chairman John Brunetti made
the official announcement March 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 23 years, peace has come to Florida racing,'' said
Brunetti. ``There were too many complications to do it for more
than one year. There are regulatory matters to be worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are obvious challenges to overcome,'' said Doug Donn,
president of Gulfstream Park, which opened Jan. 3 and was slated to
close Thursday. ``We will be like a landlord. We will run the
physical plant, and maintain the turf course and main track.
Hialeah will run the race meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   When the ``Hialeah at Gulfstream'' meeting opens, Donn will step
down as Gulfstream president to become chairman. David Romanik,
chief counsel for Gulfstream, will become president and general
manager, and run the daily operations.
</P>
<P>
   Hialeah was once the sparkling jewel of Florida racing,
unchallenged in its supremacy. In the 1970s, Gulfstream began to
creep up, and by the mid '80s, Gulfstream had surpassed Hialeah. A
fierce battle over the prime dates, January through March, ensued.
At one point, the two tracks alternated the best dates. Then came
deregulation. In 1993, the Florida tracks agreed to the current
arrangement on dates, which includes Calder running from May

<P>
   The bottom line on all this is that Florida racing fell off the
map when Gulfstream closed, not to return until Gulfstream
reopened. The switch will be a financial boon to both horsemen and
bettors. By agreement, Hialeah's horsemen received $113,500 per day
in purses, but Gulfstream, with much higher handle potential, will
pay far more. In a misguided attempt to make up for sluggish
business, Hialeah long has had an onerous takeout structure, the
highest in thoroughbred racing. That, too, has been changed.
</P>
<P>
   It is not official that racing at Hialeah is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``For now, we don't want to go beyond a one-year deal,'' said
Brunetti. However, the situation is obvious, and it is the
charismatic Frank Stronach, who bought Gulfstream then turned his
attention to Hialeah, that made it happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I, for one, feel that this is a new beginning and something I
have hoped for the last 10-15 years,'' said Brunetti.
``Unfortunately, the opportunity did not arise until now. But, with
the vision and cooperation of Mr. Frank Stronach, we are
proceeding. We don't have all the answers to all the questions, but
he and I are committed to try our best on all issues. The future
looks bright, and I look forward to the challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: Stronach eventually will buy out Brunetti.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gulfstream Park looks forward to working with Hialeah Park in
making this new `Hialeah at Gulfstream' race meet a success, and a
positive step in the right direction for all of South Florida
racing,'' said Lonny Powell, executive vice president of Magna
Entertainment, which is the leisure arm of the financial empire
built by Stronach. ``Even though our leasing of our facility to
Hialeah is currently agreed upon for one season, we consider it to
be symbolic of the desire of our company and its chairman to work
with all segments of the Florida thoroughbed industry, including
Calder, the horsemen, and the breeders.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen what will happen to Hialeah, but it could
be transformed into a park, museum, and training center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flamingos stay,'' said Brunetti.

   No sense beating around the bush with March Madness.
</P>
<P>
   The first game of the first round, between St. Bonaventure and
Kentucky, tips off Thursday at 12:20 p.m. on CBS (Channel 4). The
second game, starting around 3 or so, is Syracuse-Samford.
</P>
<P>
   The first-round night action starts at 7:55 p.m., with Maryland
vs. Iona, followed by St. John's and North Arizona around 10:30.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, CBS will switch to as many games as possible,
depending on the excitement, but as it stands, Central
Connecticut's game against Iowa State Thursday will be shown in the
Hartford area, but not Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's first-round women's game between Boston College and
Nebraska will not be shown on television, but you can monitor it on
BC's Web site, www.bceagles.com.

</P>
<P>
   The war of the mikes rages on, as NBA ratings on NBC are down 42
percent, even with Vince Carter, from last year. The NBA and NBC
are trying to get coaches to wear microphones; and coaches are just
saying no.
</P>
<P>
   The latest embarrassment occurred Sunday when both Toronto
Raptors coach Butch Carter and Seattle SuperSonics coach Paul
Westphal refused. ``I just can't do it,'' Westphal told KJR radio.
``It's an unfair restriction on my ability to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   To its credit, NBC aired a discussion about the idea during its
halftime show. Hannah Storm said that NBA commissioner David Stern
is in favor of it in part because viewers at home want to hear the
same things that people seated at courtside hear. Stern said
coaches have worn mikes for 20 years and the coaches association is
making ``a bad mistake'' in trying to ``push back the clock.''
</P>
<P>
   Storm explained that the coaches' comments during games are
screened for profanity and coaches are allowed to turn off the
mikes during sensitive times as long as they wear them for the
majority of the game.
</P>
<P>
   So much for objective journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Carter explained his decision on NBC. ``I talked to Charles
Oakley and Antonio Davis,'' Carter said. ``They asked me not to
wear it. They thought it was an invasion. My general manager asked
me to wear the mike. I cannot afford to lose the respect of my
players. If I have to, I will pay the fine myself.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC analyst Peter Vecsey also took the company line.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years coaches and players have been getting away with
denying us access,'' he said. ``When I first started covering the
league 30 years ago, I was allowed in practices, I was allowed on
team buses, on team planes. Maybe that's why they won't allow
anybody in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got increasingly worse over the years. Now I think the
league is coming down on them a little hard. But it's not that
hard. They're trying to turn something benign, these coaches and
players _ some players _ into a controversy. To me that's just an
overreaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Isiah Thomas had a more practical assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may end up getting the access that you want in terms of
being in the huddle and everything else, but you may not get the
information that you're looking for, because a lot of the coaches
and a lot of the players, once they see the microphone _ just like
anyone else _ you know you talk different and you say things
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Vecsey had the last word:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some of these coaches are so insecure and so paranoid
and such control freaks they're trying to control all the
information. Just relax. It's not going to be a big deal here. None
of this stuff is going to get out that you're so worried about.
Maybe they're worried about getting exposed that they can't
coach.''
</P>
<P>
   No word yet on whether the NBA will fine Westphal or Carter the
$100,000.

   St. John's point guard Erick Barkley explained his tiff with
teammate Bootsy Thornton to All Sports 1510's Dave Harbison. ``It's
just the devil coming into our home and just trying to do things to
us that weren't the truth and people trying to take us down, but we
all came together as a family and just stuck it to the person
whoever it was trying to do this,'' Barkley said after St. John won
the Big East crown. ``You know life goes on and I'm sure everyone's
just ready to play basketball.'' . . . ESPN2 airs ``Big League
Challenge,'' a home run contest, for 10 consecutive weeks beginning
next Monday at 5:30 p.m. Participating sluggers will be Mark
McGwire, Jose Canseco, Barry Bonds, Rafael Palmeiro, Jason Giambi,
Nomar Garciaparra, Alex Rodriguez, Shawn Green, Mike Piazza, Manny
Ramirez, Chipper Jones, and Andruw Jones. ``Our goal is to maintain
the charm and simplicity of the 1959 Home Run Derby series while
incorporating the technology of 2000,'' said Tim Scanlon, ESPN
coordinating producer. The show will use Bat Track, ESPN's
exclusive bat-speed measurement system, as well as Maskcam . . .
ABC's regional coverage of the NHL this Saturday includes
Bruins-Penguins at 3, and network officials said there will be
frequent break-ins to Colorado-Detroit so Boston viewers can see
Ray Bourque in action for the Avalanche. The Bruins game goes to 10
percent of the country while the Avalanche game will be shown in 57
percent. The third game is Rangers-Flyers . . . Former
``SportsCenter'' anchor Jack Edwards will be lead play-by-play
announcer for Major League Soccer telecasts on ESPN, ESPN2, and ABC
. . . The Patriots are scheduled to play the San Francisco 49ers on
ABC's first Monday night preseason game, the Hall of Fame Game July
31.

BIG THINGS EXPECTED OF GARCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JUPITER, Fla. _ They dress next to each other in the Red Sox
clubhouse here, and soon their families will be year-round
neighbors in a Fort Myers subdivision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just two doors away,'' Rich Garces said of moving into Derek
Lowe's slice of southwest Florida. ``I told him I'd teach him some
Spanish. He'll probably try to get me to play some golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe and Garces come into this season as the long and thick of
the Sox relief corps. The 6-foot-6-inch Lowe is all legs and
angles, with a pterodactyl's wing span. Garces, meanwhile, has the
shape and consistency of an arepa, the corn-flour tortilla so
popular in his native Venezuela. He's listed in the Sox media guide
at 215 pounds, but as one Sox staffer cracked earlier this spring,
``That's his birth weight.'' He's much closer to 260 than 215.
</P>
<P>
   But after a season in which Garces put more notches in the win
column (5) than he did in his belt, and his earned run average of
1.55 was a fraction of his weight, Garces figures to be a big man
in the pen for more than the obvious reasons. With Lowe promoted to
closer, Garces will be asked to assume a greater share of the setup
role Lowe performed with such aplomb last season.
</P>
<P>
   He may have begun to stake his claim to that job during Game 4
of the ALCS against the Yankees last October, when Jimy Williams
summoned him to face Scott Brosius and Chad Curtis with the bases
loaded in the eighth inning of a one-run game. Brosius popped out
to first and Garces struck out Curtis, ending the threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best game I ever had in my life,'' said Garces, who is
still only 28 years old but first appeared in the big leagues for
Minnesota in 1990, a decade ago. ``It was a dream come true, a game
I'll never forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the days when Sox general manager Dan Duquette, annoyed
that Garces had added a dozen pounds during camp, left him behind
and put him on the disabled list with a phantom groin strain. That
happened in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan jokes around with me now,'' Garces said. ``He asks me how
I'm doing, how's my pitching. I'm very slow. I'm not kidding
myself. But the most important thing is to keep my arm in shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes people wonder, `That guy is big, he's fat, can he do
the job?' But I did the job. My father and my mother are big, three
times bigger than me. My brothers are all big. It's not easy for
me. But as long as I'm here and working out every day, it's OK,
because I'm going to be big, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Garces, who was coming off elbow surgery, did not join the Sox
last season until July, and even then his promotion was a mixed
blessing. His wife, Lisabeth, was about to have the couple's third
child, but instead of flying back to Venezuela, Garces joined the
Sox in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little sad about missing my daughter's birth,'' Garces
said, ``but Jimy called me into his office and said, `We need you
here. You're the guy we think can do the job here. That's why we
called you up, and we hope you'll help us get to the playoffs.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That was good he said that. It gave me confidence, and look
what happened. I'm very proud of what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Garces appeared in 30 games for the Sox, all but one after the
All-Star break. Besides his five wins, he had two saves. Lefties
hit just .197 against him, righties only .150. He gave up just one
home run in 40 2/3 innings, and only 3 of the 17 runners he
inherited scored.
</P>
<P>
   He abandoned his circle changeup in favor of a split-fingered
fastball that he found very effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I faced a lot of lefties _ Tino Martinez, Robbie
Alomar, Jim Thome _ and I put them away with the split,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Garces did not make the trip here Monday for Boston's 8-6 win
over the Expos in 10 innings, but he'll be in the bullpen behind
Pedro Martinez Tuesday in Fort Myers when the Sox play the Toronto
Blue Jays. In his first three appearances, he has yet to allow a
run, giving up two hits while striking out four in four innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The games that I've pitched, I've been focused on every
pitch,'' said Garces, who will share setup duties for now with Rod
Beck and lefthanded specialist Rheal Cormier. ``Last year was the
first time I've ever been to the playoffs, and every single game
was so important. It was so exciting, and that's why I want to go
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Depending on Garces and new neighbor Lowe, the Sox just might.

<P>
   GUADALUPE VALLEY, Mexico _ As Victor Torres swished the amber
liquid between his teeth, an expression of joy spread over his
face.
</P>
<P>
   A French-trained winemaker, Torres knew he had a sweet nectar of
exquisite caliber in the making.
</P>
<P>
   Are we talking France here? Maybe Napa Valley?
</P>
<P>
   Neither. Torres is among a new breed of winemakers in the
Guadalupe Valley, a pocket of surprisingly fertile land on the
Pacific Ocean side of Mexico's Baja California. The valley is only
about 50 miles southeast of the border city of San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Blessed by a cooling coastal fog that takes the hot edge off the
region's near-desert terrain, the valley is starting to produce
award-winning wines that are gaining a toehold at upscale
restaurants and among wine lovers on both sides of the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be the Napa Valley of Mexico,'' said Torres, the
winemaker for Chateau Camou, one of about a half-dozen wineries
that have started to produce premiere wines in the valley over the
last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Just down the road from Chateau Camou, winemaker Hans Backhoff,
who grew up in this area, also praises the soil, sun and chilly
nights that create a nourishing micro-climate for grapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the influence of the sea. That's what makes this valley
so special,'' Backhoff said, as he poured a sample of Merlot aging
in a French oak barrel at his winery, Monte Xanic (pronounced,
``Mon-TAY Sha-NEEK'').
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans consume less than half a bottle of wine per person per
year, a figure that's a fraction of what consumers drink in
countries that have a love affair with the grape. Argentineans, for
example, consume around 50 liters per person annually.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans still produce far more of the ever-popular tequila and
beer. But wine consumption is indeed increasing, buoyed by a taste
for fine wine among Mexican professionals and Baja's homegrown
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Guadalupe Valley is about 10 miles east of the Baja beach
town of Ensenada, which is touting Mexico's new ``wine country'' as
a great place to visit while eating lobster enchiladas and swimming
and surfing. Hotels are stocking fliers on the Guadalupe Valley
now, and offering tours for tasting and to attend a number of
annual festivals. Cruise ships that dock in Ensenada are also
encouraging visitors. The valley's wines are featured now in fine
restaurants in Acapulco, Cancun, Mexico City and a growing number
of American cities.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the oldest winery in this hemisphere started in
Mexico, where in the 1520s Mexico's Spanish conquistadors ordered
1,000 vines planted for every 100 Indians forced to work for them.
</P>
<P>
   Then Spain, fearing competition from its colony, subsequently
banned vineyards from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Wine grapes were eventually born again in Mexico, but for
centuries vintners have produced mostly grapes for brandy or for
wine that was mediocre.
</P>
<P>
   Now vintners in Baja California, where most of Mexico's wine
grapes are grown, are getting serious about quality rather than
quantity.
</P>
<P>
   That's the mission of the Guadalupe Valley vintners, including
the oldest of the bunch, Bodegas de Santo Tomas, which was
established in 1888.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 Santo Tomas winemakers teamed up with American friends
in Northern California, a region that was also once considered an
upstart in a world of wines dominated by Europeans. The joint
venture, which first produced 5,000 cases that were released in
1998, was the brainchild of Santo Tomas and Wente Bros., a
century-old winery in the Livermore Valley east of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Christened Duetto, the wine is a blend of 50 percent Mexican and
50 percent California grapes. It is bottled in Mexico, and thus
escapes tariffs on U.S. wine imports that are hovering at about 8
percent now. A high-quality red wine mix of Cabernet Sauvignon,
Cabernet Franc and Merlot, Duetto's first vintage sold out in a
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico has the quality of the grapes. They have everything to
produce a good wine. That's for sure,'' said Marc Bourreli, Wente's
director of Latin American exports.
</P>
<P>
   This year, for the first time, 1,000 cases of Duetto will be
released in the U.S. market for retail sale and stocking at
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Torres and Backhoff's wines are also heading north.
</P>
<P>
   Backhoff, a British-trained food scientist, said he made wine as
a hobby in Baja California before getting together a group of
investors in 1987 and opening up Monte Xanic. Housed in a classic
stone building, the winery has a tasting room featuring white and
red wines that are now on wine lists in restaurants in New York,
Colorado, Arizona, California and Florida. Backhoff's wines have
picked up awards at a number of California festivals in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   The Henry Wine Group is distributing Monte Xanic now to
retailers and the Napa Valley-based Chalone Wine Group is offering
bottles of the wine to its shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Backhoff said he and his partners thought of the name of their
winery after spring rains prompted beautiful desert flowers to
bloom throughout the valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want a French name,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So they chose Xanic, which in an Indian language means ``the
first flower that blooms after the rain,'' Backhoff said. ``It's
Mexican. But it doesn't sound like tequila or tacos.''
</P>
<P>
   The vineyard is 175 acres, he added, and some of the vines are
40 years old. Part of the vineyard was previously owned by a family
of Russian descent, which took up grape growing like other Russian
immigrants to Baja California at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Xanic's wines range from US$15 to US$100. Only about 3 percent
of the product is exported, but Backhoff expects exports to climb
to 6 percent this year. Tariffs are low on Mexican wine imports to
the United States and if Mexican vintners export their wines, they
get a substantial tax break at home.
</P>
<P>
   Chateau Camou's wines are being carried by the United States'
Wine Warehouse and can be found in Chicago, Washington and this
year, the company hopes, Texas. Prices range from US$6 to more than
US$100 for wines that have won awards in French competitions in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The winery, which was founded in 1985, is constructing a new
mission-style building and its tasting room is also open for
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Torres said he is particularly proud of his white wines _
Chardonnay and Chenin Blanc _ which many experts believe Mexican
soil simply cannot produce.
</P>
<P>
   One of Torres' white wine blends, Flor de Guadalupe, recently
beat California whites in a competition north of the border, Torres
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that was one of our lower-end wines,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Torres is equally proud of the French techniques he uses, such
as gently agitating the wine periodically with a stick while it
ferments in French oak barrels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why change something that's worked for more than 200 years?''
Torres said. ``We're trying to combine tradition with modern
techniques.''

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Pope John Paul II comes to the Holy Land next week
as an elderly pilgrim determined to change the world.
</P>
<P>
   He begins his visit Monday in Jordan, then visits Israel and the
Palestinian territories until the following Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He will see the Mount Nebo in Jordan, where Moses looked upon
the promised land. He will pray above the Bethlehem cave where
tradition says Christ was born. He will deliver mass above the Sea
of Galilee, in the hills where Christ gave the speeches that became
known as the Sermon on the Mount.
</P>
<P>
   The journey presents a monumental moment in the already
remarkable life of this pontiff.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II, at 79 years of age, is the most media savvy
and well-traveled of all the popes. He scores high in U.S. public
opinion polls despite stands on issues with which many Americans
disagree _ against abortion, the death penalty and contraception.
</P>
<P>
   Long ago an amateur actor, the pope now steps onto a stage that
has the most holy sites in Christianity as its backdrop _ in the
very places Christ himself walked. It is his first trip here as
pope.
</P>
<P>
   With the pope in the twilight years of his pontificate, this
91st trip abroad could be the hallmark of a legacy that is hinged
on the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The pope has declared the year 2000 a ``Jubilee'' and ``Holy
Year.'' He asks that Catholics begin the third millennium since
Christ's birth by reflecting on their past, and building a new
future.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, the first of the Catholic Lenten period of
penitence, the pope took the unprecedented step of asking
forgiveness from God for a sweeping list of sins committed by
followers of the church.
</P>
<P>
   This week's trip is part of that renewal or, as the pope calls
it, the ``purification of memory.'' Ultimately, he aims for nothing
less than sweeping away centuries of bitterness between Jews and
Catholics _ and within different branches of Christianity itself.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere are the divisions more clear than here. Israelis and
Palestinians are still logjammed in a tense peace process. Arab
Christians _ some 180,000 of them _ are an uncomfortable minority
between the Jewish state and Muslim-dominated areas under control
of the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Some Jews accuse the Church of ignoring the Holocaust. Some
Muslims bear grudges from the Church's medieval crusades. Greek
Orthodox Christians here view the Catholic Church with suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Amid it all, the pope brings his message of reconciliation with
the hopeful enthusiasm of a pilgrim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a strong desire to go personally to pray in the most
important places which, from the Old to the New Testament, have
seen God's interventions,'' the pope wrote in June of last year.
``I say to everyone: Let us set out in the footsteps of Christ!''
</P>
<P>
   He came here in 1965, before he was pope, and commemorated the
``unforgettable experience'' in poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Some say it took the warming relations between Israel and its
Arab neighbors to make the new trip possible. Others protest that
the time is still not right, since many issues between Israelis and
Palestinians remain unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   But, the pope has talked about the Jubilee year since he
ascended to the papacy in 1978. Now appearing to suffer from
Parkinson's disease, it may be that no political circumstance could
have stopped him from making the trip _ which he insists is not
political.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be an exclusively religious pilgrimage in its nature
and purpose, and I would be saddened if anyone were to attach other
meanings to this plan of mine,'' he wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   But politics are super-imposed on any high-profile trip to the
region, and the pope's is no exception.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians worry his visits to Arab areas of east Jerusalem _
under Israeli security protection _ will be seen as a recognition
of Israeli occupation there. Israelis fear his trip to
Palestinian-controlled areas will be tantamount to a recognition of
Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is inevitable that it is going to be politicized. What will
please the Palestinians will upset the Israelis, and whatever
pleases the Israelis will upset the Palestinians,'' said Harry
Hagopian, executive director of the Jerusalem liaison office for
the Middle East Council of Churches.
</P>
<P>
   But Archbishop Pietro Sambi, the Vatican's representative to
Israel, suggested the pope's visit could ease the political
bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the pope speaks of a spiritual pilgrimage, he is not
talking about just coming to say prayers,'' Sambi said. ``He means
to make a new consensus, a sense of responsibility, a principle of
truth and justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The ground is more fertile for that than it was during the only
other papal visit to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, Pope Paul VI visited for a day. Relations were so
chilly between the Vatican and Israel that he insisted on a special
entry point into the country rather than recognize any of Israel's
official border points.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, Israeli officials still bristled at the Church's
silence during the Holocaust. Church doctrine seemed to blame Jews
for the death of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Church officials were sympathetic to Israel's Arab
neighbors. They worried that cozy relations with Israel would
endanger Christian communities in Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1960s, the church officially retracted the
accusations of Jewish involvement in Christ's death. Then, Pope
John Paul II went even further.
</P>
<P>
   He has sought forgiveness for Catholics' misdeeds during the
Holocaust and has condemned anti-Semitism dozens of times. While
church teachings used to call the Jews treacherous, this pope has
dubbed Judaism the ``elder brother'' among the Christian, Jewish
and Muslim faiths.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi David Rosen, head of the Israel office of the
Anti-Defamation League, said the pope has ``turned upside down the
whole traditional attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, with the way paved by the Oslo peace process, Israel
and the Vatican exchanged their first ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
   Of primary concern to the Vatican are the followers of the pope
in the region. There are about 70,000 Arab Christians in Israel and
the Palestinian areas who are Roman Catholics or Greek Catholics,
known also as Melkites.
</P>
<P>
   They comprise a little less than half the Christians in Israel
and the Palestinian areas _ including Greek, Syrian, Armenian
Orthodox and some Protestants. They have been overwhelmed by the
growth in the Jewish and Muslim populations.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty years ago, Christians made up about 9 percent of the
population, but now they are about 2 percent. Christians emigrate
at higher rates than non-Christians do.
</P>
<P>
   The pope is expected to encourage the local Christians to stay
in the place where Christianity began.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe he will have special blessings,'' said 77-year-old
Labibeh Abdel-Noor, leaving a Roman Catholic Mass in Jerusalem's
Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Sunday. The pope is scheduled to
hold a Mass in the church, believed by Catholics to be where Christ
was crucified and entombed, on March 26.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five years ago, Abdel-Noor was among the crowds that
greeted Paul VI. Just maybe, she said, this pope's visit can bring
people closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people can start to get united, it is easier to have
peace. We pray for peace,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But, the pope's message could be less well-received by those of
the majority religions.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials welcome the visit and say it will be a
breakthrough in Christian-Jewish relations. They have laid out more
than $10 million in roadwork and construction for the visit.
</P>
<P>
   A poll this month showed most Israelis see the visit positively.
</P>
<P>
   But, a fringe of right-wing Israelis have threatened to disrupt
the visit if they can. Signs and graffiti in Jerusalem have labeled
the pope a ``pagan'' who should be shunned.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Chief Rabbi Israel Meir Lau said he hopes the pope will
use a visit to the Yad Vashem Holocaust museum to apologize for the
silence of Pope Pius XII during the Holocaust. He said the pope's
Lenten confession of sins, which did not mention the Holocaust,
showed ``serious historical myopia.''
</P>
<P>
   An apology for Pius XII is extremely unlikely. He is in the
running for sainthood and popes are considered infallible under
Catholic doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   But, the pope has asked for 15 minutes to speak at Yad Vashem
and is using the event to meet Jews from his hometown in Poland who
fled the Holocaust. Some were among the pope's childhood friends.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, officials of the Palestinian Authority _ which
controls the Palestinian areas _ have warmly welcomed the visit,
while some Muslims chose to bear their own grudges. One Muslim
leader called for the pope to apologize for the Crusades.
</P>
<P>
   For most of his trip, the pope will be surrounded by 18,000
police in the largest security operation in Israeli history. Entire
neighborhoods will be closed when the pope is nearby, prompting
concerns that the isolation will frustrate local Christians and
deprive the pope of the crowd contact from which he draws strength.
</P>
<P>
   Two of his ``Pope Mobiles'' are being flown in and a smaller one
has been constructed to navigate the narrow streets of Jerusalem's
Old City. He will spend his nights in the house of the Vatican
delegation here, an old mansion with Arab tile floors and a small
chapel. A helicopter pad was built nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's itinerary includes time alone at Holy sites for
meditation. He will also give a Mass before about 100,000 near the
Sea of Galilee, and another to an expected 7,000 in Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
   The pope is also visiting the Holocaust museum and a Palestinian
refugee camp _ two sites that are not destinations for religious
pilgrimage. They are his nod to the trip's tense political
backdrop, where he can show sympathy for suffering on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's trying to present a model for how you go about
reconciliation,'' said the Rev. Drew Christiansen, a Jesuit advisor
for international affairs to the United States Catholic Conference.
``It's a moment of grace and, God willing, everyone will be open to
the grace _ wherever they stand.''

   GUADALUPE VALLEY, Mexico _ As Victor Torres swished the amber
liquid between his teeth, an expression of joy spread over his
face.
</P>
<P>
   A French-trained winemaker, Torres knew he had a sweet nectar of
exquisite caliber in the making.
</P>
<P>
   Are we talking France here? Maybe Napa Valley?
</P>
<P>
   Neither. Torres is among a new breed of winemakers in the
Guadalupe Valley, a pocket of surprisingly fertile land on the
Pacific Ocean side of Mexico's Baja California. The valley is only
about 50 miles southeast of the border city of San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Blessed by a cooling coastal fog that takes the hot edge off the
region's near-desert terrain, the valley is starting to produce
award-winning wines that are gaining a toehold at upscale
restaurants and among wine lovers on both sides of the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be the Napa Valley of Mexico,'' said Torres, the
winemaker for Chateau Camou, one of about a half-dozen wineries
that have started to produce premiere wines in the valley over the
last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Just down the road from Chateau Camou, winemaker Hans Backhoff,
who grew up in this area, also praises the soil, sun and chilly
nights that create a nourishing micro-climate for grapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the influence of the sea. That's what makes this valley
so special,'' Backhoff said, as he poured a sample of Merlot aging
in a French oak barrel at his winery, Monte Xanic (pronounced,
``Mon-TAY Sha-NEEK'').
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans consume less than half a bottle of wine per person per
year, a figure that's a fraction of what consumers drink in
countries that have a love affair with the grape. Argentineans, for
example, consume around 50 liters per person annually.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans still produce far more of the ever-popular tequila and
beer. But wine consumption is indeed increasing, buoyed by a taste
for fine wine among Mexican professionals and Baja's homegrown
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Guadalupe Valley is about 10 miles east of the Baja beach
town of Ensenada, which is touting Mexico's new ``wine country'' as
a great place to visit while eating lobster enchiladas and swimming
and surfing. Hotels are stocking fliers on the Guadalupe Valley
now, and offering tours for tasting and to attend a number of
annual festivals. Cruise ships that dock in Ensenada are also
encouraging visitors. The valley's wines are featured now in fine
restaurants in Acapulco, Cancun, Mexico City and a growing number
of American cities.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the oldest winery in this hemisphere started in
Mexico, where in the 1520s Mexico's Spanish conquistadors ordered
1,000 vines planted for every 100 Indians forced to work for them.
</P>
<P>
   Then Spain, fearing competition from its colony, subsequently
banned vineyards from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Wine grapes were eventually born again in Mexico, but for
centuries vintners have produced mostly grapes for brandy or for
wine that was mediocre.
</P>
<P>
   Now vintners in Baja California, where most of Mexico's wine
grapes are grown, are getting serious about quality rather than
quantity.
</P>
<P>
   That's the mission of the Guadalupe Valley vintners, including
the oldest of the bunch, Bodegas de Santo Tomas, which was
established in 1888.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 Santo Tomas winemakers teamed up with American friends
in Northern California, a region that was also once considered an
upstart in a world of wines dominated by Europeans. The joint
venture, which first produced 5,000 cases that were released in
1998, was the brainchild of Santo Tomas and Wente Bros., a
century-old winery in the Livermore Valley east of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Christened Duetto, the wine is a blend of 50 percent Mexican and
50 percent California grapes. It is bottled in Mexico, and thus
escapes tariffs on U.S. wine imports that are hovering at about 8
percent now. A high-quality red wine mix of Cabernet Sauvignon,
Cabernet Franc and Merlot, Duetto's first vintage sold out in a
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico has the quality of the grapes. They have everything to
produce a good wine. That's for sure,'' said Marc Bourreli, Wente's
director of Latin American exports.
</P>
<P>
   This year, for the first time, 1,000 cases of Duetto will be
released in the U.S. market for retail sale and stocking at
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Torres and Backhoff's wines are also heading north.
</P>
<P>
   Backhoff, a British-trained food scientist, said he made wine as
a hobby in Baja California before getting together a group of
investors in 1987 and opening up Monte Xanic. Housed in a classic
stone building, the winery has a tasting room featuring white and
red wines that are now on wine lists in restaurants in New York,
Colorado, Arizona, California and Florida. Backhoff's wines have
picked up awards at a number of California festivals in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   The Henry Wine Group is distributing Monte Xanic now to
retailers and the Napa Valley-based Chalone Wine Group is offering
bottles of the wine to its shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Backhoff said he and his partners thought of the name of their
winery after spring rains prompted beautiful desert flowers to
bloom throughout the valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want a French name,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So they chose Xanic, which in an Indian language means ``the
first flower that blooms after the rain,'' Backhoff said. ``It's
Mexican. But it doesn't sound like tequila or tacos.''
</P>
<P>
   The vineyard is 175 acres, he added, and some of the vines are
40 years old. Part of the vineyard was previously owned by a family
of Russian descent, which took up grape growing like other Russian
immigrants to Baja California at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Xanic's wines range from US$15 to US$100. Only about 3 percent
of the product is exported, but Backhoff expects exports to climb
to 6 percent this year. Tariffs are low on Mexican wine imports to
the United States and if Mexican vintners export their wines, they
get a substantial tax break at home.
</P>
<P>
   Chateau Camou's wines are being carried by the United States'
Wine Warehouse and can be found in Chicago, Washington and this
year, the company hopes, Texas. Prices range from US$6 to more than
US$100 for wines that have won awards in French competitions in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The winery, which was founded in 1985, is constructing a new
mission-style building and its tasting room is also open for
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Torres said he is particularly proud of his white wines _
Chardonnay and Chenin Blanc _ which many experts believe Mexican
soil simply cannot produce.
</P>
<P>
   One of Torres' white wine blends, Flor de Guadalupe, recently
beat California whites in a competition north of the border, Torres
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that was one of our lower-end wines,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Torres is equally proud of the French techniques he uses, such
as gently agitating the wine periodically with a stick while it
ferments in French oak barrels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why change something that's worked for more than 200 years?''
Torres said. ``We're trying to combine tradition with modern
techniques.''

 &HT;    PAPAL VISIT TO HOLY LAND A PERSONAL PILGRIMAGE WITH GLOBAL

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Pope John Paul II comes to the Holy Land next week
as an elderly pilgrim determined to change the world.
</P>
<P>
   He begins his visit Monday in Jordan, then visits Israel and the
Palestinian territories until the following Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He will see the Mount Nebo in Jordan, where Moses looked upon
the promised land. He will pray above the Bethlehem cave where
tradition says Christ was born. He will deliver mass above the Sea
of Galilee, in the hills where Christ gave the speeches that became
known as the Sermon on the Mount.
</P>
<P>
   The journey presents a monumental moment in the already
remarkable life of this pontiff.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II, at 79 years of age, is the most media savvy
and well-traveled of all the popes. He scores high in U.S. public
opinion polls despite stands on issues with which many Americans
disagree _ against abortion, the death penalty and contraception.
</P>
<P>
   Long ago an amateur actor, the pope now steps onto a stage that
has the most holy sites in Christianity as its backdrop _ in the
very places Christ himself walked. It is his first trip here as
pope.
</P>
<P>
   With the pope in the twilight years of his pontificate, this
91st trip abroad could be the hallmark of a legacy that is hinged
on the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The pope has declared the year 2000 a ``Jubilee'' and ``Holy
Year.'' He asks that Catholics begin the third millennium since
Christ's birth by reflecting on their past, and building a new
future.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, the first of the Catholic Lenten period of
penitence, the pope took the unprecedented step of asking
forgiveness from God for a sweeping list of sins committed by
followers of the church.
</P>
<P>
   This week's trip is part of that renewal or, as the pope calls
it, the ``purification of memory.'' Ultimately, he aims for nothing
less than sweeping away centuries of bitterness between Jews and
Catholics _ and within different branches of Christianity itself.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere are the divisions more clear than here. Israelis and
Palestinians are still logjammed in a tense peace process. Arab
Christians _ some 180,000 of them _ are an uncomfortable minority
between the Jewish state and Muslim-dominated areas under control
of the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Some Jews accuse the Church of ignoring the Holocaust. Some
Muslims bear grudges from the Church's medieval crusades. Greek
Orthodox Christians here view the Catholic Church with suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Amid it all, the pope brings his message of reconciliation with
the hopeful enthusiasm of a pilgrim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a strong desire to go personally to pray in the most
important places which, from the Old to the New Testament, have
seen God's interventions,'' the pope wrote in June of last year.
``I say to everyone: Let us set out in the footsteps of Christ!''
</P>
<P>
   He came here in 1965, before he was pope, and commemorated the
``unforgettable experience'' in poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Some say it took the warming relations between Israel and its
Arab neighbors to make the new trip possible. Others protest that
the time is still not right, since many issues between Israelis and
Palestinians remain unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   But, the pope has talked about the Jubilee year since he
ascended to the papacy in 1978. Now appearing to suffer from
Parkinson's disease, it may be that no political circumstance could
have stopped him from making the trip _ which he insists is not
political.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be an exclusively religious pilgrimage in its nature
and purpose, and I would be saddened if anyone were to attach other
meanings to this plan of mine,'' he wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   But politics are super-imposed on any high-profile trip to the
region, and the pope's is no exception.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians worry his visits to Arab areas of east Jerusalem _
under Israeli security protection _ will be seen as a recognition
of Israeli occupation there. Israelis fear his trip to
Palestinian-controlled areas will be tantamount to a recognition of
Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is inevitable that it is going to be politicized. What will
please the Palestinians will upset the Israelis, and whatever
pleases the Israelis will upset the Palestinians,'' said Harry
Hagopian, executive director of the Jerusalem liaison office for
the Middle East Council of Churches.
</P>
<P>
   But Archbishop Pietro Sambi, the Vatican's representative to
Israel, suggested the pope's visit could ease the political
bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the pope speaks of a spiritual pilgrimage, he is not
talking about just coming to say prayers,'' Sambi said. ``He means
to make a new consensus, a sense of responsibility, a principle of
truth and justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The ground is more fertile for that than it was during the only
other papal visit to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, Pope Paul VI visited for a day. Relations were so
chilly between the Vatican and Israel that he insisted on a special
entry point into the country rather than recognize any of Israel's
official border points.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, Israeli officials still bristled at the Church's
silence during the Holocaust. Church doctrine seemed to blame Jews
for the death of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Church officials were sympathetic to Israel's Arab
neighbors. They worried that cozy relations with Israel would
endanger Christian communities in Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1960s, the church officially retracted the
accusations of Jewish involvement in Christ's death. Then, Pope
John Paul II went even further.
</P>
<P>
   He has sought forgiveness for Catholics' misdeeds during the
Holocaust and has condemned anti-Semitism dozens of times. While
church teachings used to call the Jews treacherous, this pope has
dubbed Judaism the ``elder brother'' among the Christian, Jewish
and Muslim faiths.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi David Rosen, head of the Israel office of the
Anti-Defamation League, said the pope has ``turned upside down the
whole traditional attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, with the way paved by the Oslo peace process, Israel
and the Vatican exchanged their first ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
   Of primary concern to the Vatican are the followers of the pope
in the region. There are about 70,000 Arab Christians in Israel and
the Palestinian areas who are Roman Catholics or Greek Catholics,
known also as Melkites.
</P>
<P>
   They comprise a little less than half the Christians in Israel
and the Palestinian areas _ including Greek, Syrian, Armenian
Orthodox and some Protestants. They have been overwhelmed by the
growth in the Jewish and Muslim populations.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty years ago, Christians made up about 9 percent of the
population, but now they are about 2 percent. Christians emigrate
at higher rates than non-Christians do.
</P>
<P>
   The pope is expected to encourage the local Christians to stay
in the place where Christianity began.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe he will have special blessings,'' said 77-year-old
Labibeh Abdel-Noor, leaving a Roman Catholic Mass in Jerusalem's
Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Sunday. The pope is scheduled to
hold a Mass in the church, believed by Catholics to be where Christ
was crucified and entombed, on March 26.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five years ago, Abdel-Noor was among the crowds that
greeted Paul VI. Just maybe, she said, this pope's visit can bring
people closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people can start to get united, it is easier to have
peace. We pray for peace,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But, the pope's message could be less well-received by those of
the majority religions.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials welcome the visit and say it will be a
breakthrough in Christian-Jewish relations. They have laid out more
than $10 million in roadwork and construction for the visit.
</P>
<P>
   A poll this month showed most Israelis see the visit positively.
</P>
<P>
   But, a fringe of right-wing Israelis have threatened to disrupt
the visit if they can. Signs and graffiti in Jerusalem have labeled
the pope a ``pagan'' who should be shunned.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Chief Rabbi Israel Meir Lau said he hopes the pope will
use a visit to the Yad Vashem Holocaust museum to apologize for the
silence of Pope Pius XII during the Holocaust. He said the pope's
Lenten confession of sins, which did not mention the Holocaust,
showed ``serious historical myopia.''
</P>
<P>
   An apology for Pius XII is extremely unlikely. He is in the
running for sainthood and popes are considered infallible under
Catholic doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   But, the pope has asked for 15 minutes to speak at Yad Vashem
and is using the event to meet Jews from his hometown in Poland who
fled the Holocaust. Some were among the pope's childhood friends.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, officials of the Palestinian Authority _ which
controls the Palestinian areas _ have warmly welcomed the visit,
while some Muslims chose to bear their own grudges. One Muslim
leader called for the pope to apologize for the Crusades.
</P>
<P>
   For most of his trip, the pope will be surrounded by 18,000
police in the largest security operation in Israeli history. Entire
neighborhoods will be closed when the pope is nearby, prompting
concerns that the isolation will frustrate local Christians and
deprive the pope of the crowd contact from which he draws strength.
</P>
<P>
   Two of his ``Pope Mobiles'' are being flown in and a smaller one
has been constructed to navigate the narrow streets of Jerusalem's
Old City. He will spend his nights in the house of the Vatican
delegation here, an old mansion with Arab tile floors and a small
chapel. A helicopter pad was built nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's itinerary includes time alone at Holy sites for
meditation. He will also give a Mass before about 100,000 near the
Sea of Galilee, and another to an expected 7,000 in Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
   The pope is also visiting the Holocaust museum and a Palestinian
refugee camp _ two sites that are not destinations for religious
pilgrimage. They are his nod to the trip's tense political
backdrop, where he can show sympathy for suffering on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's trying to present a model for how you go about
reconciliation,'' said the Rev. Drew Christiansen, a Jesuit advisor
for international affairs to the United States Catholic Conference.
``It's a moment of grace and, God willing, everyone will be open to
the grace _ wherever they stand.''
</P>

A GRAY AREA IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- He has raised political money in California
pretty much the way George W. Bush has raised it throughout the
country _ without apology and on a scale essentially without
precedent.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bush, he's also done it without serious legal challenge,
though ethicists and reformers howl at the sheer excess.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Bush, California Governor Gray Davis is an
experienced Democratic pol down to his shoes. And he does not share
the ``passion'' his man, Vice President Al Gore, says he has
developed in his effort to supplant John McCain as the leading
advocate of campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   To the contrary, Davis just finished a busy election season in
which he opposed the attempt to rewrite the state's anything-goes
election finance laws by referendum.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Proposition 25's demise, the governor may now
support an effort by the state's Democratic leaders to write
legislation focusing on limits on currently unregulated
contributions. But it is nowhere near the top of his priorities
list.
</P>
<P>
   It's Davis's detached, cold, borderline cynicism about the
national shouting match over political cash that makes him
interesting these days.
</P>
<P>
   The word Davis uses often to describe the argument about
limitless gifts of soft money and ``independent'' expenditures on
the side by interest groups and wealthy individuals is
``irrelevant.'' He figures that what matters most to California
voters is the health of the state's economy, which having made a
successful transition out of its Cold War dependance on aerospace
is no longer lagging behind the country's prosperity. That also
means continuing to clean up the air and keep the coast free of any
more oil rigs; it means a dropping crime rate and a continuing push
for more gun control; and it means defending a woman's right to
choose.
</P>
<P>
   With that mix, Davis figures Gore starts the campaign 8 to 10
points ahead of Bush here and the numbers back him up.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign finance reform, to Davis, is of consequence only if
campaign finance abuses can be connected to something in government
that is not happening that people strongly want to happen. Were
Gore and Bush to agree on some mutual restrictions on money this
fall (don't hold your breath), that wouldn't bother the governor;
nor would passage of new regulations by Congress or his own state's
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   But Davis says without flinching that he has seen no evidence
that reform is a top priority for the public.
</P>
<P>
   Where California is concerned, he and other Democrats make an
additional point. Bush may or may not score points going around the
country repeating two words that have magical status for his
handlers _ ``Buddhist temple.'' In this state, they figure every
time that happens, another Asian-American decides to vote for Gore.
This increasingly important segment of the voting population, once
up for grabs, has been realigning Democratic ever since the uproar
over the campaign sins of 1996 began exceeding the hard evidence of
malfeasance.
</P>
<P>
   But Davis's point about campaign money not meaning anything
without an issue connection that matters to ordinary people can be
answered. Taxes, HMO reform, tobacco industry crackdown, the
environment, and the minimum wage come to mind just for starters.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, things would be happening if special interests did
not continually trump the national interest, with campaign cash the
basic medium of exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Davis may have an unassailable point about what matters most to
voters, but the fact is that campaign finance reform can be made to
matter precisely by making the connection the governor tends to
dismiss.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office last year, Davis has become a walking
advertisement for reform. While his governance gets very high marks
and he couldn't be more popular, he wasted no time raising some $13
million for his political fund, an obscene amount that is on a
comparative par with Bush's now-dissipated $70 million. To make it
worse, Davis's money _ entirely within the law _ comes from every
corporation and union with an agenda.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the money was raised in case the referendum that failed
last week had passed, and it will give Davis a huge headstart
should a reform measure pass later this year. And an initiative
adopted by the voters four years ago and tied up in the courts,
whose limits are positively draconian, may yet emerge intact.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has a point. Here and nationally, nothing tops the Big
Four issues he believes Gore can win on (the economy, crime and gun
control, choice, and the environment). Reform or nonreform, it pays
to focus on issues that matter most to people and never to lose
that focus.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not an argument for failing to pick up John McCain's
fallen standard. Davis's stance works for him, but it is not
president-worthy.

A SIGN-OFF OF THE TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those pesky little tails that form our phrasal verbs _ help out,
back up, roll over _ can cause no end of trouble, if trouble's what
you're looking for. They trigger people's redundancy alarms,
resulting in headlines like ``Public servants step to the plate'' _
yes, it's real _ instead of the idiomatic step up to. They can
masquerade as prepositions, sowing grammatical confusion among
those who don't want to end their sentences with you-know-what.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes sign off on, with a brand-new strategy for confusing
us. ``In the good old days,'' writes Robert Skole of Boston, ``sign
off indicated the end of a radio program.'' Now, there's a new
usage: ``Kennedy personally signed off on the Hilsman cable,''
Boston Redevelopment Authority officials signed off on an insider
condo deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did the BRA hacks sign and approve the deal? Did President
Kennedy personally sign and approve the cable? Or did they do the
opposite?'' asks Skole. ``Did they say `I'm not getting involved _
I'm signing off'?''
</P>
<P>
   He isn't just picking nits here. In fact, sign off on has had
two shades of meaning _ to rubber-stamp an order and to accept
ultimate responsibility for it _ during most of its short life. In
the 1970s and '80s, both senses are current: ``You wouldn't believe
the kinds of things I have to sign off on,'' laments a Washington
bureaucrat about the trivial paperwork on his desk; but ``I now
forbid submission of legislation . . . unless my office signs off
on it,'' says a state governor, plainly meaning ``the buck stops
here.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, William Safire dismisses sign off on as military
bureaucratese, a way of deferring to a higher authority. And Paul
Dickson, in the 1990 edition of his ``Slang,'' defines it as ``To
sign or initial; to pass along. To approve something without
assuming responsibility for it; to not disagree with higher
authority.'' But the ``take final responsibility'' meaning is in
continuous use as well.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 1990s, the balance shifts. Sign off on makes it into
a dictionary, the American Heritage third edition (1992), as
``Informal: to express approval formally or conclusively.''
Oxford's Concise English Dictionary (1999) also admits it, with the
label ``US informal.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not obvious why sign off on should be labeled informal,
when sign over, sign away, sign on to, sign out, and other kin are
treated as standard. Probably it's just a matter of time, and the
newbie will be accepted in forthcoming editions, reflecting its
growing dominance.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, we could just say approve. But approval is abstract,
while sign off on, even if it's used figuratively, suggests the
flourish of a pen and a signature in ink. That's why we love our
Germanic verbs, with their natural talent for two-part and
three-part inventions.

INTEL, AMD GET NOSE TO NOSE AND LET THE CHIPS FLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; SUNNYVALE, Calif. _ There's nothing Silicon Valley loves more
than a good old-fashioned chip war.
</P>
<P>
   And riveting the Valley today is a dogfight between the
industry's two biggest players _ Intel Corp., the $30 billion
chipmaker, and its much smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc.,
or AMD.
</P>
<P>
   Competition is nothing new to the Valley, where companies are
admonished to either eat someone's lunch or be someone's lunch.
What makes this contest interesting is the sheer audacity of AMD in
taking on Intel, one of the fiercest competitors in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, AMD, which hasn't had a profitable year since 1995,
seems to be scoring big. Last week, AMD made headlines by beating
Intel in introducing an ultrafast one-gigahertz chip.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a yappy little dog making a run at a pit bull,''
said Keith Diefendorff, editor in chief of the Microprocessor
Report, an industry newsletter. ``It's amazing that they've even
come close and have even beaten Intel. It's quite astonishing,
really.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's the story in a nutshell: While both companies were
founded in the late 1960s at the dawn of Silicon Valley, Intel has
since buried its rivals with better talent, better designs, and
legendary drive, becoming the undisputed king-of-the-hill and
owning more than 80 percent of the $24 billion PC chip market.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, AMD has struggled to remain alive by focusing on less
expensive chips. In the mid-1990s, AMD's scrappy chief executive
and founder, Jerry Sanders, decided to bet his company on a new
chip design that he hoped would let AMD compete head to head with
Intel. The gamble was huge, involving expenditures in the billions
of dollars to develop the chips and build state-of-the-art
factories.
</P>
<P>
   ``They bet their entire company on this,'' said Diefendorff.
</P>
<P>
   What resulted was the Athlon line of chips, which began shipping
in June. For the first time, AMD had a viable answer to Intel's
high-end microprocessors, which are the brains in computers. ``We
had never before been in the high-performance space before the
Athlon,'' said Stephen A. Lapinski, AMD's director of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   AMD began to see its market share creep up, particularly at the
high end of the market. In January 1999, Intel commanded 97 percent
of the sales in the United States for chips used in personal
computers that sold for $1,500 to $2,000, while AMD had 3 percent,
according to Stephen Baker, director of hardware analysis at PC
Data in Reston, Va. By January 2000, Intel's share was down to 53.5
percent, while AMD claimed 46.5 percent, Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   And last week, AMD was able to pull off its greatest coup by
introducing the fastest chip on the market _ the one-gigahertz
Athlon processor _ two days before Intel.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something nobody has been able to challenge Intel on,''
said Baker. ``It's a great marketing coup.''
</P>
<P>
   But a marketing victory may be the only meaningful prize AMD
will get for its troubles, some analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``AMD won the race but only by the narrowest of margins,''
Diefendorff said. ``It's so narrow that in the big scheme of
things, it's not going to be very significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Diefendorff points to weaknesses in the Athlon chip that slow
down its overall performance. The biggest problem, perhaps, is that
the chip's cache, or internal memory, sits slightly apart from the
processor, forcing information to travel to the processor and
slowing down the chip by slivers of a second. Intel's cache sits on
the processor itself, saving time.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we put our processor on a racetrack, it will have higher
performance in total,'' said Ralph Bond, an Intel spokesman, of the
Intel Pentium gigahertz compared to the Athlon gigahertz. ``We
wound up with the fastest processor in the world, but we didn't
have the fastest news release in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, AMD has reason to crow. Just as Bill Bradley forced Vice
President Al Gore to fine-tune his campaign, AMD has made Intel
more fleetfooted. The result: Consumers have benefited because
products such as the gigahertz chip have come out months ahead of
schedule and prices have come down faster than if Intel were
unopposed, analysts say. Aside from that, the rivalry has made for
good theater in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Said Diefendorff: ``You can't deny AMD's got guts.''

RECESSION IN JAPAN SHRINKS GDP, NIKKEI 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Japanese economy, which has struggled for eight years under
a start-and-stop recovery, has again taken a turn for the worse.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's Economic Planning Agency reported Monday that the
economy contracted 1.4 percent in the October-December quarter,
officially sending the world's second-biggest economy back into
recession.
</P>
<P>
   Economists said the decline highlighted Japan's difficulty
shaking off a slump triggered by a pop in the stock market and real
estate bubble more than a decade ago. Japan's economic slump,
officially dating since 1992, is the worst and longest endured by
an industrial country in the post-World War II period.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economic number indicates the worst isn't over yet,'' said
William Wendler, vice president of Rowe Price-Fleming
International, an investment adviser to mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to bad economic news, the Nikkei index of 225 stocks
plunged 560.47 Monday, or almost 3 percent, to close at 19,189.93.
</P>
<P>
   Other Asian markets followed, including Hong Kong's Hang Seng
index, which declined 735.18, or more than 4 percent, to 17,096.68.
</P>
<P>
   Despite strong gains in the Nikkei in 1999 _ gains driven by a
run-up in Japan's technology sector _ Japan's main stock index has
returned to only half of its all-time high of 38,915.87, achieved
in December 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth-quarter slowdown reported Monday compounded the
effects of a third-quarter contraction. The official definition of
recession is two consecutive quarters of economic decline.
</P>
<P>
   The basic problem inf Japan's economy has been a failure of
consumer spending to ignite and gain momentum.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three months of 1999, consumer demand declined 1.6
percent, while housing investment, another measure of consumer
confidence, tumbled 5.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth-quarter decline came as the effects of a huge public
works spending package and tax cuts passed in late 1998, which
stimulated demand by a national of 120 million people, began to
wear off, Japan experts said. Public investment, which includes
spending on public works, fell by 5.4 percent in the final quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to soften the bad news, government officials have been
saying the economy could pull out of its slump this year as the
financial sector and old-line Japanese businesses begin to see
benefits from a sweeping restructuring of the nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
   One of Japan's major newspapers, Nihon Keizai Shimbun, quoted a
government official over the weekend who said the government this
month would report the economy shows ``signs of staging a
self-sustaining recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are restructuring changes going on in the private and
government sector, and this we have to overcome so we expected some
hard times,'' said Ryuichi Hattori, head of economic affairs for
the Consulate General of Japan in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The government expects the economy to grow in the January-March
quarter, Hattori said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, growth has eluded Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The recession started in the third quarter of 1992, after a
collapse in stock and real estate prices began to drag down the
entire economy and weaken the banking sector, which had heavily
invested in stocks and property. Since then, the economy has
struggled through four recessions, which are punctuated by periods
of weak growth and hopes of a full-fledged recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Economists see bright signs in the government's latest economic
report, which said there was a 4.6 percent increase in capital
spending by businesses last quarter. It was the best quarter for
capital spending since mid-1995; Japanese companies followed the
example of their US counterparts by investing in computers and
information technology. Industrial production and machinery orders
have also increased over the past several months.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Posen, a Japan expert and senior fellow at the Institute
for International Economics in Washington, said the corporate
outlays were encouraging. He said a pickup in corporate spending
typically precedes a pickup in consumer spending as a country pulls
out of recession.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he noted that a decline in consumer spending was the
result of positive steps by Japanese companies to restructure,
which included cutting back on employee bonuses, overtime, and
wages overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers are definitely bad, but people shouldn't look at
them as though we're going back into a terrible state,'' Posen
said.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's minister of finance, Kiichi Miyazawa, made a similar
argument to the Diet in January, saying that Japan must reduce its
reliance on public-sector stimulus to the economy and ``pass the
baton from public to private demand and put the economy back onto a
path toward full recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hiromi Murakami, research associate for the Economic
Strategy Institute in Washington, said he was more pessimistic. He
argued the Japanese government needs to do more to foster economic
recovery, especially by restructuring an economy increasingly
viewed as rigid and outmoded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan has been suffering for such a long time,'' said
Murakami. A general election this year could prolong the
government's gridlock. The Liberal Democratic Party, which is
viewed as antireform and protective of farming and small-business
interests, is trying to hold onto its coalition in the lower Diet,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Government spending programs, such as those enacted two years
ago and again recently, ``can be a temporal effect like we saw in
early 1999, but it doesn't seem like the fundamental economic
recovery.''

 &HT;    Atlantan's furniture wins national awards
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, March 16.
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Michael Gilmartin first began making furniture in
the 1970s, it was anything goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just shot from the hip with lots of organic forms,'' the
Atlanta artist said. ``Now, what I'm trying to do is introduce lots
of sweeping curves to really balance the pieces out.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, it's working. For the past two years, Gilmartin's
pieces have won prestigious national Awards for Design Excellence
presented by Design Journal, the most recent for his AVOS Armchair.
The piece, featured in the February issue, is made of a special
Douglas fir plywood and reminiscent of the work of modern designer
Charles Eames.
</P>
<P>
   ``I designed the chair back in the '80s around the `A' and `V'
shapes,'' said Gilmartin, who is among 250 craft artists chosen to
show their work in this weekend's American Craft Council Craft Show
at the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   The artist uses laminated, 13-ply-per-inch aircraft plywood made
specially for him. Not only is the material extremely stable for
sculpting, but it ages in the warm tones of cherry. The wood's
striation effect is enhanced by an oil-and-urethane finish.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmartin, 49, draws much of his inspiration from the modern
designers of the 20th century. ``They wanted to make pieces that
speak about today,'' he said. ``What I'm trying to do is to make
those pieces accessible to more people.''
</P>
<P>
   The artist operates a one-man studio in an old warehouse
district off Huff Road. It's a business that began more than 20
years ago when he moved to Atlanta from Philadelphia, shortly after
earning a master's of business administration degree. Despite the
advanced degree, ``I never got a real job,'' Gilmartin said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a friend asked him to form a business, and Gilmartin
built a career of designing and building custom furniture for homes
and businesses _ so custom that clients go to his studio to be
``fitted'' for his chairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ergonomics is a buzzword, but the beauty of my chairs is that
you can shift your weight in them,'' he said, citing their
contoured backs and adjustable seats.
</P>
<P>
   Two of his most popular designs are the Gilmartin Chair, a
rocker that won a 1998 Award for Design Excellence, and the AVOS,
which beat out more than 1,600 entries in last year's residential
seating category.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent over two weeks judging this category, and if it were
not for a deadline, it would have been two months,'' said John
Moses, publisher of Design Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmartin has made about 15 of the AVOS chairs. It takes six to
eight weeks to produce one, and it sells for $3,450. The Gilmartin
rocker, now part of the permanent collection of the Mint Museum in
Charlotte, sells for $3,895.
</P>
<P>
   The artist doesn't claim a favorite item to craft. ``The AVOS
chair is fun to do, though, because of the stark linearity of it,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   And as modern furnishings continue to experience a revival in
popularity, the design is bound to enjoy appeal among fans of fine
crafts. ``Most people want something that looks good and that they
can use,'' Gilmartin said.

 &HT;    Metal's sleek styling is showing up all over the house giving
any decor a dose of design impact
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday March 16.
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Metal is back with a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   After years of being limited to patio furniture and contemporary
pieces that blended best with modern decor, designers are creating
metal furnishings in every form imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   From tables to chairs, to bed frames, breakfast bars, desks,
lamps and candleholders, metal is one of the hottest materials in
the home furnishings market.
</P>
<P>
   But we're not talking about any metal. This is the season of
silver tones. The trend toward steel, aluminum, pewter, zinc and
polished iron is so strong it has spilled over into the paint
department. Designers are using faux metallic paint with a matte or
textured finish to give wood furniture and accessories the look of
metal.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the longest time, brass and glass were the mainstay,''
said Jackie Hirschhaut, vice president of the American Furniture
Manufacturers Association in High Point, N.C. ``But metal will be
very prevalent in the year 2000. We'll have 2,400 exhibitors this
year at High Point (the world's largest wholesale furniture
market), and I can assure you there will be plenty of metal
furniture within that mix.''
</P>
<P>
   Metal furniture and accessories accounted for $2.5 billion in
national furniture sales in 1999, or about 10 percent of the
industry total, and the figure is expected to grow.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the popularity of metal can be seen in the local
furniture industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market has been very positive in Atlanta,'' said Jimmy
Huff, vice president of Huff Furniture in Buckhead. ``We've seen an
increase in sales in the last three years, basically because
there's more designs to choose from.''
</P>
<P>
   Business is so good that Gloria Ventura, a metro Atlanta artisan
who specializes in iron and aluminum works, stopped designing metal
fabrications for developers two years ago to focus solely on
furniture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would consider Atlanta a traditional town, but metal
furniture sells very nicely,'' Ventura said. ``That's the style for
the millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Strader, who owns Mercury Metals in Decatur, Ga., with his
twin brother, Todd, said the demand for metal is so strong that
lately he's been making more furniture than sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The furniture and other metal is what pays the bills,'' he
said, ``but there's no demand for sculptures. People will spend
$2,000 on a chair, but when it comes to a sculpture, forget about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason for metal's heavy appeal is the price. A stainless
steel lamp, for example, can run from $79 to $1,500 at a furniture
or department store, making it affordable for consumers of various
income levels.
</P>
<P>
   Pottery Barn, based in California, has retro-inspired metal
office furniture in its spring collection. One of the
fastest-selling items in the group is a pair of zinc picture
frames, priced at $12.
</P>
<P>
   ``The frames are so popular it's hard to keep them in stock,''
said Lesley McClendon, who manages the chain's Lenox Square store.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers like metal furnishings because they are durable and
come in smooth, sculpted lines that add to a room's architectural
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   They also like them because they fit into a variety of
decorating schemes, be it traditional, contemporary or eclectic,
and they blend well with wood and fabric. Finishes can be shiny and
smooth, brushed, rough or slightly rusty and dull, for a
distressed, antiquish look.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Klein, an Atlanta entrepreneur, has collected metal
objects and furniture since the mid-'70s. He says the newer pieces
he has purchased, such as a dining room table and stainless steel
chair, have a decidedly different look from his earlier items.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was extremely modern back then, where now it's a little
more traditional and the design has gotten more sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's comfortable, but each piece stands on its own and makes a
statement. That's why I like it,'' said Klein.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Brotman, a professional tennis player in Alpharetta, Ga.,
accessorized his home with metal art and tables because he likes
the way metal contrasts with his furniture.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my furniture is basically wood, but I've accessorized it
with metal because it gives it more of a clean, lofty look.
Everything I've bought I look at as a piece of art. It looks like
one-of-a-kind stuff,'' said Brotman.
</P>
<P>
   B U Y I N G T I P S
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Solid metal furniture is more durable than furniture made from
metal piping. Generally, the heavier the metal, the sturdier the
object.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Metal should be smoothly welded at the joints.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Nicks indicate poor quality and could rust.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The base or legs of the furniture should have shoes, or
gliders, to prevent damage to the carpet or floor.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A finish, such as a powder or polyurethane coating, will
prevent rusting and give the furniture a smoother look and feel.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hand-forged metal is more expensive than a welded or hammered
item because of the craftsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Stainless steel, pewter and gunmetal are usually more
expensive than aluminum, chrome, zinc, regular steel and unfinished
iron.
</P>
<P>
   H O W T O C A R E F O R M E T A L
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't let an unfinished metal base come in contact with water
because it will rust.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Clean finished or unfinished metal with a soft, dry cloth.
Occasional cleaning with a damp cloth is suitable for finished
objects.

HARD WORK WINS VOSKUHL RESPECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The two Jakes have lived with each other for four seasons now.
One Jake goes about his business on the University of Connecticut
campus, going to class, hanging out, driving the coeds crazy.
</P>
<P>
   The other Jake has been the starting center for coach Jim
Calhoun's Huskies for four years. He has played 136 games, starting
133 of them. No one has started more games in UConn history. And
few have ever worked harder than Jake Voskuhl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazing,'' Calhoun said about the 6-foot-11-inch, 245-pound
man-child who roams in the pivot and helped bring a national
championship to Storrs in last year's magical season. ``His
development from where he was as a freshman to where he is now is
remarkable. And it's going to continue. He's going to be playing
somewhere next year and a lot of years after.''
</P>
<P>
   For Voskuhl, that can wait. He's still got a few games at UConn
to play, starting Friday when the Huskies play Utah State in an
NCAA first-round game in Birmingham, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers that Voskhul puts up don't dazzle you; he is
averaging 6.2 points and 6.4 rebounds a game for his career.
Offensively, he's still a work in progress that may never be
completed. He has never had a 20-point game in his UConn career,
although he disputes a story floating around campus that he never
reached 20 points even in high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not true,'' Voskuhl said with a laugh, shaking his
head. ``I scored 20 points a couple of times in high school.
Somehow that story got started and my dad kind of pushed it along.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he did score 20 in one game,'' said Voskuhl's high
school coach, Butch Sigler. ``In his defense, I must say he did
have a lot of 18s and 12s (points and rebounds).
</P>
<P>
   ``Jake's all about winning and team. Scoring's never been a big
thing to him. In high school, he played a similar role he plays for
UConn. He does all the little things that help you win.''
</P>
<P>
   You would think that since the 20-point barrier seems to loom so
large, Voskuhl would remember the date and circumstances of when he
broke it. Mysteriously, he does not.
</P>
<P>
   But that, too, is Voskuhl, always ready to have some fun, even
at his own expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's out there,'' said Calhoun, who has yelled at and
counseled Voskuhl ever since seeing him in an AAU tournament in Las
Vegas. ``He just does his own thing. But he's a pretty tough kid.''
</P>
<P>
   What Calhoun liked was the intangible confidence that is bred
into players in winning programs.
</P>
<P>
   Voskuhl is a classic case in point. He came to UConn from Strake
Jesuit Prep School in Houston, which won four consecutive state
championships, compiling an overall record of 105-15. Voskuhl was a
two-time All-State selection.
</P>
<P>
   At UConn, he is part of a team that has won 108 games, two Big
East regular-season titles, two Big East tournament titles, and an
NCAA championship.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Voskuhl was something different at UConn. He was
tall, he was blond, and he was from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``A matinee idol,'' Calhoun said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Voskuhl hears this compliment and laughs, coming close to
blushing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got one girlfriend,'' he said. ``That's all I'm going to
say.''
</P>
<P>
   Voskuhl has always been reticent about talking about himself.
That is for others to do. He is deeply religious, which helped him
cope a year ago when a nagging foot injury plagued him through the
latter stage of the regular season and much of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Voskuhl's collegiate career is winding down, he looks
back in amazement at how quickly it has passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe that it's gone this quickly,'' said Voskuhl,
who has quietly become one of the leaders on a team that had a
``rough trip'' this season. ``This season has worn us down.''
</P>
<P>
   In February, the Huskies went into a bit of a tailspin, losing
four games (they lost only nine all season).
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just one of those things,'' said Voskuhl. ``We didn't
have everyone on the same page. I think we straightened that out.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason was Voskuhl. He developed more consistency on
offense, scoring in double figures five straight games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been a real consistent presence for us down low,'' said
guard Albert Mouring. ``And we've needed him to do that. We all
knew he could do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Voskuhl can and will do it, but that is not what UConn needs
from him. Mouring, forward Kevin Freeman, and guard Khalid El-Amin
will provide the offense.
</P>
<P>
   Voskuhl is more of a role player, one who can energize his
teammates by providing moments of instant offense or defense.
</P>
<P>
   His career, like his life, is in a state of transition. He knows
he can play at the next level but is in no hurry. The past two
summers, he has attended the Pete Newell Big Man camp in Hawaii,
one of the more prestigious summer camps. He said that helped him,
but what has helped him even more is simply maturing as a player
and a person.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see it in him over the past couple of years,'' said
UConn associate head coach Dave Leitao. ``He's more assertive. He's
still doing the things he has done here since Day One, but he's got
more confidence. He doesn't let bad games affect him as much.''
</P>
<P>
   The end of his college career is near, but Voskuhl isn't quite
ready to walk away from it yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think too many teams want to play us,'' he said. ``And
I say that with not any kind of arrogance. People just know we know
how to win games. We've won a championship. We know what to do when
the game is close. We feel we're going to win every game we play.''
</P>
<P>
   Pure Voskuhl. Calhoun calls him a rah-rah guy, but one who isn't
vocal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just his attitude,'' said Calhoun. ``Everything is always
upbeat. You feel good when you are around him.''
</P>
<P>
   Voskuhl speaks so matter-of-factly that it doesn't sound like a
boast. It sounds like, well, Jake.
</P>
<P>
   Both of them.

FISHING INDUSTRY SEES SHARKS RAW DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts fishermen thought they were being smart
when they started selling Cape sharks to the British for fish and
chips in the 1990s, turning New Bedford into America's
shark-fishing capital. Regulators had even urged them to net these
unwanted ``trash fish'' to ease pressure on the beleaguered cod.
</P>
<P>
   But now US Commerce Secretary Richard Daley is considering a
plan that would all but shut down the $8 million fishery amid
mounting evidence that the sharks, better known as spiny dogfish,
are in danger. Once again, say scientists, fishermen have caught
too many, driving another fish species to the brink of collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The management plan has set off a bitter dispute between
conservationists and fishermen, who say they feel double-crossed
after federal officials encouraged the dogfish industry.
Massachusetts' senators and three members of Congress have
temporarily blocked the closure, arguing that more research is
needed to prove the dogfish are as bad off as biologists say.
</P>
<P>
   The federal plan ``basically puts these (dogfish) processors out
of the business and it's going to snuff out a lot of the day
fishermen,'' said Harvey B. Mickelson, attorney for the American
Dogfish Association, which represents three dogfish processing
plants in New Bedford as well as shark fishermen from Massachusetts
to North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   However, conservationists say that fishermen and New England
regulators can blame themselves because they blocked more modest
restrictions in earlier years.
</P>
<P>
   Now, conservationists say that Senators John F. Kerry and Edward
M. Kennedy and congressmen are protecting a local industry at the
shark's expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The short-term economic interests of one state are now
threatening an entire East Coast shark population, as well as the
shark conservation record of the nation,'' said Sonja Fordham,
fisheries project manager at the Center for Marine Conservation in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Dogfish, which seldom grow more than 3 feet long, have none of
the menace associated with sharks, but, like sharks, the females
take a long time to mature _ 12 years _ and then they carry their
fetuses for two years before giving birth. As a result, say
scientists, they have difficulty recovering from heavy fishing
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   But that hardly seemed like a problem in the late 1980s when
dogfish were annoyingly common, often caught in nets that had been
set for cod or other fish. As New England fishing grounds crashed,
state and federal officials alike urged fishermen to find a market
for dogfish and other ``underutilized species,'' sometimes hosting
buffets for consumers to try these delicacies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on dogfish because the National Marine Fisheries Service
said some eight or nine years ago that they are a wonderful
underutilized resource. Go and develop a market,'' said fishermen's
attorney Mickelson.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts fishermen took the advice to heart, accounting for
55 percent of the 49 million pounds of US dogfish landed in 1998.
Three of the four major processing plants are in New Bedford, while
47 to 90 percent of the fish landings in Chatham, Scituate, and
Plymouth were dogfish, virtually all of it bound for Europe and
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   However, scientists say that 10 years of unrestricted fishing
for dogfish has had a devastating effect, mainly because the
females are larger and fetch the highest price in the market. The
quantity of sexually mature females has dropped by more than 80
percent since 1990, imperiling the next generation of fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't sustain a fishery very long if you target the
pregnant females,'' said John Musick, head of the vertebrate
ecology program at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science and an
authority on dogfish.
</P>
<P>
   But Fordham said efforts to regulate the dogfish catch over the
past five years have run into resistance from fishermen and the New
England Fishery Management Council, which jointly regulates Cape
shark fishing along with the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management
Council.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, last January, Secretary Daley approved a plan from the
two councils that set such low limits on the dogfish catch that it
would end direct fishing for the shark on May 1. The plan then sets
tight fishing limits for rebuilding the dogfish population over the
next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Senators Kennedy and Kerry, along with US
Representatives William Delahunt, Barney Frank, and James McGovern,
intervened, asking Daley to delay action on the plan until
mid-March.
</P>
<P>
   The members of Congress argued that, despite the supposed
crisis, dogfish are still enormously abundant, accounting for 40
percent of fish caught by federal scientists last summer. They also
pointed out that the New England Fishery Management Council
reversed its support for the plan after initially submitting it.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Daley, the members of Congress agreed on the need
for ``a very substantial reduction in the dogfish catch,'' but the
current plan will have a ``very severe impact . . . on one of the
few remaining . . . viable fisheries in New Bedford.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, with Daley's dogfish decision imminent,
representatives of the two regional fishing councils are scheduled
to meet in Annapolis, Md., to disuss a new conservation plan for
him to consider, with the New Englanders pushing for less
restrictive fishing limits.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't impress Fordham of the Center for Marine
Conservation. ``We are going to create a collapse that is going to
take decades to repair. That's just a huge shame, and a waste of
public resources,'' she said.

DENOUNCING NBC'S `GOD' IS CLOSE MINDED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Conservatives are a funny lot, aren't they?
</P>
<P>
   Not ha-ha funny because, let's face it, some conservatives are
as humorous as a root canal. But funny as in odd, as in peculiar,
as in there's just no making some folks happy.
</P>
<P>
   See, you'd think they would be the last folks to condemn a
television show that considers why a just, loving God would allow
evil to persist; how, if we're created in the image of our Maker,
we're occasionally such worthless toadies; and whether this world
we've so misused and abused is worth saving.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think, in a medium infiltrated by witches, mafiosos, and a
liberal president, they would be pleased as punch to have a program
starring God. Yet there they were condemning NBC's new animated
comedy, ``God, the Devil, and Bob,'' even before it debuted last
week. At least nine stations in such holier-than-thou states as
Utah, Mississippi, Idaho, Indiana, and Louisiana refused to air the
show last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Created by Matthew Carlson, a former seminarian, the animated
comedy (Tuesdays, 8:30 p.m., NBC) features the voices of James
Garner as God, Alan Cumming as the Devil, and French Stewart as
Bob, a Detroit autoworker randomly selected to prove that humankind
deserves to be spared from Almighty annihilation. God, who here
looks a lot like Jerry Garcia, loves Lite beer and Pop Tarts, hates
megastores and having His name taken in vain, and will pull a
double rainbow out of His bag of tricks to cheer up his minions.
</P>
<P>
   In its first show, which skewered money-grubbing televangelists
and portrayed Hell as a place where Guy Lombardo endlessly plays
``Auld Lang Syne,'' God encouraged simple acts of kindness, and
better communication and understanding between parents and their
children. Rev. Ellwood Kieser, a Los Angeles priest and a
consultant on the program, called it ``a good show for a family to
watch together and discuss'' because ``it pulls people into a
religious realm, into a God-centered universe.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Other religious groups are raining verbal fire,
including Nihad Award, executive director of the Council on
American-Islamic Relations in Washington, D.C, who denounced the
show as the ``kind of tasteless and trivial portrayal of God that
does a disservice to the millions of American television viewers
who have deeply felt religious beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   The reaction to ``God, the Devil and Bob,'' which drew nearly 15
million viewers last week, isn't that far off from what happened in
1997 when ABC's ``Nothing Sacred,'' premiered. A smart, promising
drama, it featured Kevin Anderson as a young inner-city priest, and
offered a reflection on spirituality and religion in modern times.
But ``Nothing Sacred'' was immediately condemned and dogged by such
groups as the Catholic League until its abrupt cancellation during
its first season.
</P>
<P>
   Such people and groups, self-appointed judges of what's best for
the rest of us, are forever closed to anything offering a
challenging consideration of religion or God, even if such programs
have at their core the most basic and reverent viewpoints. It seems
TV will be forever damned to nothing more complicated than
``Touched by an Angel,'' which has less spiritual maturity than an
episode of ``Davey and Golitah.''
</P>
<P>
   Why is it that programs interested in exploring spirituality in
a contemporary context, and even making it more accessible, are
instantly targeted by conservatives as enemies of organized
religion? They complain that TV is a godless wasteland of bimbos,
himbos, and wrestlers, yet whenever someone tries to present
religious issues, whether in a comedy or drama, they are cast out
like a bunch of Judases. And come to think of it, where was all
this righteous indignation when marriage, an institution some of
these same folks hold so dear they feel the need to legislate its
definition, was mocked when Fox's ``Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire?'' allowed two knucklehead strangers to get
hitched?
</P>
<P>
   Now, is ``God, the Devil and Bob'' a great show? Well, no. But
it's all of a week old, and there's just enough there to hint that
it could get better. If its creators are up to the task, it could
become the sort of smart, thought-provoking comedy with more on its
mind that cheap, easy laughs.
</P>
<P>
   But only if it's allowed to _ and given what happened to
``Nothing Sacred,'' that may be too much to ask. Yet given time,
some people, especially those who criticize such shows without
actually watching them, might find these programs' views of God and
spirituality aren't all that foreign to their own.

HAPPINESS IS A POSITIVE THOUGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA WEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not always easy to be happy. A Japanese proverb describes
the pursuit as ``clutching a shadow or chasing the wind.'' And
Woody Allen in the movie ``Annie Hall'' darkly notes: ``Life can be
divided into the horrible and miserable.''
</P>
<P>
   But, in a departure from decades of research on depression,
psychologists are now actively studying what makes us happy. Dubbed
``positive psychology,'' researchers ask questions such as: Do
happy people tend to share similar attitudes or life circumstances?
Does wealth create happiness? How do we define happiness and how do
we get there?
</P>
<P>
   Martin Seligman, a University of Pennsylvania psychology
professor who is widely regarded as the father of positive
psychology, believes that an optimistic outlook is a key component
to happiness and that it can be learned. Indeed, Seligman is the
author of the popular 1990 book, ``Learned Optimism.''
</P>
<P>
   After 30 years of research on the topic, Seligman asserts that
optimistic people tend to distance themselves from and minimize the
causes of their misfortune, instead taking credit for the good
things that happen to them. Pessimists, on the other hand, blame
themselves for their misfortune and ascribe good events to chance,
he says.
</P>
<P>
   If your boss is brusque with you one day, you could either chalk
it up to the boss's bad day or believe the event occurred because
you're a worthless person.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must not just fix what is wrong in people, but find what is
strong about them,'' said Seligman, who coined the phrase positive
psychology during his 1998 tenure as president of the American
Psychological Association.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers have looked at the role that friendships,
marriage, religious affiliation and money play in achieving
happiness. And new studies are investigating the brain activity of
happy people.
</P>
<P>
   The American Psychological Association dedicated a special
millenium issue of its journal to ``Happiness, Excellence and
Optimal Human Functioning.'' And the psychiatric community is
taking notice as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's catching people's fancy,'' said Dr. George Vaillant,
director of psychiatric research at Brigham and Women's Hospital in
Boston, who published an article last month on the role that
altruism and humor play in a joyful life. ``It's looking at the
positive end of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Positive psychology is also seen as a modern-day solution for
emotional woes that aren't severe enough to require Prozac or years
on an analyst's couch. They say positive psychology is akin to
cognitive therapy, which helps people change their negative thought
patterns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appeals to people. It makes sense,'' said Phil Levendusky,
director of psychology at McLean Hospital in Belmont. ``It doesn't
have you languishing in memories of your early childhood, such as
what happened when your diapers were changed. It's contemporary
problem-solving. It's practical, pragmatic and it works.''
</P>
<P>
   But the profession is far from in agreement on the matter. When
Seligman was asked what he would recommend for a hypothetical
nephew suffering from severe depression, he said he would advise
cognitive therapy _ with no antidepressant medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``(That's) the dark ages,'' said Bessel A. van der Kolk,
professor of psychiatry at the Boston University School of Medicine
and medical director of its trauma center. ``Before
anti-depressants, people would be in the hospital for months.''
</P>
<P>
   Van der Kolk also said positive-psychology enthusiasts go too
far in minimizing the role of past trauma in people's lives, which
often must be talked about freely before a depressed person can get
better.
</P>
<P>
   Even some researchers who study happiness bristle at the broad
definition of positive psychology; Seligman and others include the
study of courage and love in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The label of positive psychology can go very far,'' said
Norbert Schwarz, a psychology professor at the University of
Michigan. ``It becomes warm and fuzzy and hard to understand.''
</P>
<P>
   So, while the academics duke it out about what happiness is and
isn't, and how you achieve it, what do ordinary people have to say
about the matter? Ed Diener of the University of Illinois, in an
article called ``Subjective Well-Being,'' found that happy people
report mild-to-moderate pleasant emotions most of the time, rather
than intense positive moments some of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``One lesson from these findings is that if people seek ecstasy
much of the time, whether it be in a career or in a love
relationship, they are likely to be disappointed,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   And now researchers are getting closer to describing what the
happy brain might look like.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 15 years, Richard Davidson, a professor of
psychology and psychiatry at the University of Wisconsin in
Madison, has conducted studies on brain activity of happy and
depressed people. The left prefrontal cortices of self-described
happy people were bursting with nerve-cell activity while those who
were depressed had more active right prefrontal lobes.
</P>
<P>
   People with active left prefrontal cortices, he said, were found
to be the kind who ``jumped out of bed each day.''
</P>
<P>
   He said measuring brain activity may help clinicians confirm if
a treatment _ say drugs or cognitive therapy _ is working for a
depressed patient.
</P>
<P>
   His work has led some people to wonder if a ``happiness drug''
that stimulates the left prefrontal cortex could be developed.
Meanwhile, Davidson said researchers are looking at whether
external magnetic fields might one day be used to stimulate this
area of the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers are looking at how the typical ups and downs
of a day influence happiness, and how chance events fit it into the
picture.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz of the University of Michigan found that people who came
upon unclaimed dimes at a copy machine (planted by researchers)
reported greater levels of overall satisfaction with their lives
than those who did not find coins. (Their upbeat mood, however,
lasted for only 20 minutes.)
</P>
<P>
   The study had another twist. When researchers asked participants
about their happiness levels _ but first asked them if they'd
discovered dimes at a copy machine and heard them say yes _ the
coins lost their ability to influence mood. It seems chance events
failed to influence mood once the participants were made conscious
of the event.
</P>
<P>
   For Schwarz, the dime study shows just how people's happiness
levels fluctuate throughout the day based on random events. We can
gain more control over our moods, he explained, if we acknowledge
that there are random forces that influence them.
</P>
<P>
   David Myers of Hope College in Holland, Mich., in an article
last month called, ``The Funds, Friends and Faith of Happy
People,'' found that age, gender and income (except that of those
who were very poor; they were unhappy) did not correlate with a
person's sense of happiness.
</P>
<P>
   He found it was more revealing to know about someone's ``traits
and the quality of their work and leisure experiences.'' In
numerous studies over the last two decades, he found people were
most happy when they had spiritual faith of some kind and the
support of a network of close relationships, including marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Myers said these studies confirm the view that depression's grip
on the modern American psyche has much to do with individuals
losing traditional social networks.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, marriage is not always joyful. Myers found that
people who identified themselves in ``not-very-happy marriages''
were less happy than those who were single or divorced.
</P>
<P>
   And now, positive psychology is making its way into the
workplace. Business psychologist Michael Mercer of Barrington,
Ill., said many businesses test optimism using questionnaires
during the interview process. Because people in sales, for
instance, may require an extra dose of ego-protecting optimism to
be effective, employers may offer sales jobs to those highest on
the optimism scale.
</P>
<P>
   Positive psychology has clearly triggered a wide range of
research, and psychologists continue to work to define the field
and its goals. Seligman said he hopes the field keeps its broad
focus, because he believes that positive virtues, such as honesty,
compassion and wisdom, should be studied so society knows how to
encourage these characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   Said Seligman: ``This is not just happy-ology.''

   MEDFORD, N.J. _ The actor Christopher Reeve is a proponent of
it. Michael J. Fox recently announced his retirement from a hit
television series to become a full-time activist for it. A number
of individuals and families affected by amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS), or Lou Gehrig's Disease, have started their own
initiatives on its various fronts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'' has been called ``guerrilla science'' _ a war on
incurable, often deadly, diseases. Though the terms are
militaristic, the goals are to save, not take, lives. The weapons
are ideas, money and research.
</P>
<P>
   Reeve, representing people with paralyzing spinal cord injuries,
has made no secret of his determination to walk again. He's not shy
about using his celebrity and show business friends to raise
awareness and the money needed for research he, advised by medical
specialists, deems most promising.
</P>
<P>
   Fox intends to do the same for Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   People with ALS don't have anyone that famous to focus attention
on the disease. We did _ actor David Niven. But he chose to keep
his disease secret until after his death.
</P>
<P>
   But average, everyday people with ALS are tired of waiting for
someone rich or famous. And all of us with incurable diseases are
tired of waiting for the pharmaceuticals companies or the
government to discover treatments or cures.
</P>
<P>
   The major drug companies are not even looking because there are
not enough of us with any one neurological disorder to make it
financially worth their while. Colds, obesity and allergies are
what guarantee drug sales. Or the big diseases like cancer and
heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   The government, for the first time this year, has budgeted $3
million for motor neuron (the nerves that communicate with the
muscles) disease research, but the government process, and that of
major organizations like the ALS Association, is, of necessity,
slower. In the interest of fairness and to spread as wide as
possible a net, requests for proposals are made and then a panel of
experts reviews and rates the proposals before grants are made.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Abendroth, chairman of the ALS Association's Research
Committee, objects to being called slow. (In fact, any money I
raise personally, through my own research fund, I trust the ALS
Association to direct to the most promising work.)
</P>
<P>
   ``ALSA's approach to finding answers to this disease parallels,
but is much broader than, the various new private initiatives,''
Abendroth said. ``Although we believe that our multiple approach to
research is the most effective, ALSA is more than willing to work
with the new private initiatives in the expectation that we can
learn from each other, not duplicate or waste precious ALS research
dollars, and assure that all avenues of research are used to find
the answers for this disease.''
</P>
<P>
   But the private initiatives are faster. The people heading them
up have a special sense of urgency because they or a loved one are
affected personally by the diseases.
</P>
<P>
   They frequently come from a ``can-do'' business environment
where once a problem is identified, goals are quickly set,
resources gathered and the problem is attacked.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is not fairness, it's results, so the process is to
raise money, quickly and continuously, shortcut the scientific and
governmental bureaucracies and seek out the top scientists whom
they then attract, fund and motivate.
</P>
<P>
   One of the researchers who has been a prime target is Dr.
Jeffery Rothstein of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.
Rothstein said, ``My lab, and ... a few other large ALS labs, have
benefited greatly from this approach. We tend to use these
privately funded initiatives to begin new work on `high-risk,
high-impact' projects, those that will aggressively explore new
therapies ... without waiting for the slower, but still very
important NIH or ALSA-supported grants.''
</P>
<P>
   NIH is the National Institutes for Health, the government's
medical research branch. Dr. Kenneth Fischbeck, chief of
neurogenetics at the neurology arm of the NIH, speaking at a recent
research seminar in Philadelphia, said that his division's
leadership recognizes the federal government must supplement the
private research initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The private initiatives can be pro-active and aren't hampered
by the lengthy grant review process, which the NIH requires in the
interest of fairness and peer review, but which can slow down
funding for new and promising research approaches,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Fischbeck and Rothstein urge caution, however. In
Rothstein's opinion, the people behind the private initiatives can
be aggressive, understandably so under the circumstances, and try
to intrude on or direct the research. They may also push to publish
results prematurely. Fischbeck is concerned that some of the
efforts may be redundant, or that expectations may be too high.
</P>
<P>
   Christina Clark (her son has ALS) of Michigan heads one of those
family foundations, ALS BioTeam (Foundation for Interdisciplinary
Motor Neuron Medicine). She objects to the term ``guerrilla
science.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark says, ``It implies, negatively, that we have suited up as
scientists. We make no such claim. Rather, we make informed
decisions about the use of our funds. We are investors, in some
instances offering strategic and management support. We are
`guerrilla strategists,' perhaps, `guerrilla activists,' perhaps,
bringing urgency into the priorities of ALS research and accepting
higher risks.''
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the label, the fact remains that the pushy private
initiatives have lighted fires under researchers, the government
and traditional organizations like ALSA _ fires that are fueled by
the hopes of thousands of people who are fed up with the words,
``I'm sorry. There's nothing we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   I cannot begin to describe the excitement you feel, as an
individual with one of the ``hopeless'' diseases, when you hear
someone like Rothstein speak about research with stem cells
actually regrowing those vital motor neurons, or when you see a
piece such as the recent one on the NBC Nightly News about a family
fighting for their sister's life, raising hundreds of thousands of
dollars for promising research (Project ALS, in New York), or when
a television ad shows Reeve ``walking.''
</P>
<P>
   False hope is an oxymoron. Real hope is just across the
laboratory table.
</P>

   DELHI _ Which is it to be, Mr. Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   The American president comes to India on March 20, the first
such visit for 22 years, and the subcontinent's two most
strenuously forward-looking cities, Bangalore and Hyderabad, are
competing furiously for his attention.
</P>
<P>
   Both are in the south of India, and are both vying to become the
most important centers of India's booming software industry but he
will only visit one of them. Which will it be?
</P>
<P>
   Bangalore is the obvious choice. The original home of India's IT
industry, the one home-grown industry since independence which has
truly shown signs of growing into a world beater.
</P>
<P>
   Bangalore is also the home of India's richest man, Wipro chief
executive Azim Premji, who is now hot on the heels of Microsoft's
Bill Gates for the title of richest man in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Indians dub Bangalore ``the garden city.'' It also has a balmy
climate and the glimmerings of a modern lifestyle for its
burgeoning middle class, notably a number of pubs where hard-driven
software engineers go to unwind.
</P>
<P>
   Amid these pleasant surroundings, the city's software companies
have increased their exports from 50 million rupees in 1991-2 to 32
billion in 1998-9, making it without question the IT capital of
India.
</P>
<P>
   Hyderabad, by contrast, is an upstart, with less than one-tenth
the value of Bangalore's software exports.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the competition for Clinton's attention has been fierce, and
there have recently been some indications that Hyderabad may clinch
it. If it does, two men can share the credit: Bill Gates and
Chandrababu Naidu.
</P>
<P>
   Bangalore's problem is that the IT companies have made their
homes there despite rather than because of Karnataka state's
politicians and policies.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its natural endowments, Bangalore, like most Indian
cities, is strikingly ill-governed. The power supply is inadequate
and erratic, with wild fluctuations in voltage; the air, which
should be perfumed by the millions of flowers, instead is poisoned
by the fumes of the thousands of rickshaws which run in place of
proper taxis.
</P>
<P>
   The last chief minister, J.H. Patel, didn't help much: he freely
confessed to the prime minister's task force on information
technology that he didn't understand the difference between
software and hardware.
</P>
<P>
   In Hyderabad, by contrast, the state's chief minister,
Chandrababu Naidu, is working overtime to ensure it becomes India's
first truly modern city, where high technology firms will function
with ease.
</P>
<P>
   By convincing Bill Gates, among other important foreigners, that
he really means it, and can pull it off, Naidu has gone a long way
to achieving his goal. Clinton's visit, if it transpires, will be
another milestone along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, Microsoft opened a research and development center
on the top floor of Cyber Towers, Naidu's answer to Bangalore's
Electronics City. It was Microsoft's first research-and-development
facility outside corporate headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Cyber Towers looks set to succeed more smoothly than Bangalore's
equivalent. And the city displays a lucid appreciation of what IT
companies expect and need: totally dependable services, including
electricity, drinkable tap water, banks with ATMs, even speedy,
localized customs clearance.
</P>
<P>
   If it resembles a little node of extraterritoriality, almost a
colony, Naidu, recently voted man of the millennium by one national
newspaper, isn't bothered. The important thing is to give the lead.
</P>
<P>
   The speed with which he is transforming Hyderabad into a sort of
Indian Osaka or Shanghai is stunning.
</P>
<P>
   But although Naidu's achievement in Hyderabad displays much more
political muscularity than is the Indian norm, both he and his
recently elected opposite number in Bangalore, S.M. Krishna,
confront similar basic problems.
</P>
<P>
   Their substantially middle-class cities both sit amid vast
poverty-stricken hinterlands. The chief ministers babble of bytes
and hobnob with men worth billions. But millions of the people who
voted them into power have barely enough to eat, plough their
fields with the aid of bullocks, have no electricity and few
amenities of any sort.
</P>
<P>
   Many commit female infanticide or secretly sell girl babies to
escape the dowry trap.
</P>
<P>
   Literacy rates are low in both states. The north of Andhra
Pradesh, the state of which Hyderabad is capital, is racked by a
long-running insurgency by left extremists.
</P>
<P>
   India's permanent nightmare is of absolute polarization: of what
locally they call ``the creamy layer'' getting as rich as
middle-class consumers in the West _ richer, if you throw maids and
chauffeurs into the calculation _ while the outcasts, the bonded
laborers and poor farmers sink into permanent misery, or migrate to
the cities and scavenge what they can from the city's rubbish. &QL;

GRAVE DEBATE: EXHUMATION ORDERED OF BODY CLAIMED TO BE THAT OF
JESSE JAMES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL HANNA 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRANBURY, Texas _ For many here, there's no doubt that the famed
outlaw Jesse James is buried in Granbury Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Even if history books say he died at the hands of Bob Ford on
April 3, 1882, in St. Joseph, Mo., they see the exhumation _ and
DNA testing _ as clinching proof that the accounts from their
childhood are true.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly don't think it's even a possibility that it's not
him because I've talked to the grandsons,'' said Mary Kate Durham,
75, an authority on local history, referring to three retirees who
live in Oklahoma, Arkansas and Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't agree with the tests, the grandsons might dig
him up and bury him somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Hood County Judge Linda Steen signed an exhumation
order, removing the last hurdle to exhuming a body buried here in
1951. The remains are those of J. Frank Dalton, who told Granbury
residents that he was James. If so, he would have been 104 when he
died.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family's position to me is they want to know who they are
and they have a right to that,'' said Steen, who counts herself
among those convinced that the real Jesse James is buried in
Granbury.
</P>
<P>
   Steen's predecessor, Don Cleveland, did not grant a similar
request in 1996, saying that the family did not provide a
compelling reason for an exhumation.
</P>
<P>
   The county judge's order comes despite DNA testing of remains
exhumed in 1995 from what historians and relatives have identified
as Jesse James' grave in Kearney, Mo. Experts said that results are
consistent with what is known of the 19th-century outlaw.
</P>
<P>
   Bud Hardcastle, an Oklahoma used-car salesman who represents the
purported grandsons, contends that the tests, by George Washington
University forensic scientist James Starrs, were inconclusive.
Moreover, he said, a tooth found in a museum, rather than one taken
from the grave, was used to determine the DNA match.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes as planned, the Granbury grave will be opened within
30 to 60 days, Hardcastle said.
</P>
<P>
   He asserts that James faked his death to elude authorities and
moved to Texas under the assumed name of Dalton. When Dalton died
in 1951, a ``visual'' autopsy by the Hood County sheriff listed at
least 16 bullet wounds, rope burns on a 17 1/2-inch neck, scarred
and burned feet, and the tip of the left index finger ``sawed
off.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Hood County seat, possessing the remains of the notorious
outlaw is a source of pride to some and a source of bemusement to
others.
</P>
<P>
   Jeannine Macon, owner of the Brazos River Trading Co., said
she's curious to see the results of DNA tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to find out if these stories are true,'' Macon said.
</P>
<P>
   Macon, who moved from Dallas 28 years ago, said it's possible
that James died in Granbury but concedes that there may have been
some embellishment along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people like a story. They enjoy folklore and take it
with a grain of salt,'' Macon said. ``Texans are famous for telling
tall tales.''
</P>
<P>
   Jesse James is not the only infamous character who locals insist
had passed time in Granbury.
</P>
<P>
   John St. Helen, an unsuccessful Granbury saloon keeper, claimed
when he was close to death that he was really John Wilkes Booth,
the assassin of President Lincoln. St. Helen recovered and fled
Hood County, eventually dying in Oklahoma. A court denied a 1966
request to exhume remains from Booth's grave in Baltimore for DNA
testing.
</P>
<P>
   According to local legend, bandit queen Belle Starr maintained a
hideaway in northwest Hood County where she trafficked in horses
that she repeatedly sold and stole. Not far away in Hico, William
``Billy the Kid'' Bonney is supposedly buried under the alias
Brushy Bill Roberts _ not at Fort Sumner, N.M., as history holds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Elvis sightings _ everybody loves a mystery,'' said
Carolyn Brennecka of the Jesse James Farm and Museum, which is on
the James farm six miles outside Kearney, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man in Granbury has probably been the most famous
imposter,'' Brennecka said. ``Whatever way this comes out, there
will probably be more claims surfacing later. But what we know is
this is the birthplace of Jesse James. Whatever tests they come up
with, they can't take that away.''

   BINGE-DRINKING (Washington) _ The Harvard survey that
popularized the term ``binge drinking'' to define excessive alcohol
consumption among college students now reports an increase in
frequent binge drinkers on campus. That's defined as downing four
or five drinks in a row on three or more occasions in two weeks.
But there's good news as well. The percentage of students
abstaining from alcohol is also on the rise. By DAN FREEDMAN.

At stake in the census are billions of dollars in federal and state

has reached $100,000, a full-scale criminal investigation is under

the episode has touched so many people; I just lost my own beloved
bichon to cancer and the empty house is painful to bear. By

   PRIMARY _ Voters are heading to the polls in six Southern states
to vote in presidential primaries today. The total available
delegates in the contests puts both Al Gore and George W. Bush in
position to win enough delegates to clench their party nominations.

   BALD-PRESIDENT _ On March 1, George W. Bush was cornered. David
Letterman was razzing him about international politics.
Specifically, about how the Republican presidential candidate
didn't know the leaders of some foreign countries. The punch line?
He asked Bush if he knew the name of the president of the Hair Club
for Men. Bush's response: ``You're not talking about ... Sy
Sperling, are you?'' While the audience laughed in New York,
Sperling almost fell off his treadmill in his Hillsboro Beach home.
``I flipped out. I couldn't believe it,'' Sperling says. ``I mean,
I know people know who I am, but this was
</P>
<P>
   amazing. I guess advertising works!'' But Sperling started
thinking about Bush's response. He started thinking about hair not
an uncommon thing to do, in his business. He made a connection, and
got the word out to The Media. ``There just may be a direct link
between having hair and becoming president,'' says an urgently
faxed press release from Hair Club for Men. ``It's a formula: The
candidate with most hair wins.... It's been documented that since
the dawn of the television age, every elected president since
Kennedy, and including Kennedy, has had hair.'' (Hutchins, Palm
Beach Post). WITH PHOTOS.

&HT;     CALIFORNIA URGES CAUTION IN USE OF HERBAL REMEDIES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIN McCORMICK  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In Sacramento, an acupuncturist was sold the
wrong Chinese herb for a tea meant to help her arthritis. She wound
up in a coma and, when she woke up, her hands and legs were
partially paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   In Novato, a woman swallowed some capsules of an imported herbal
cold medicine and got so sick that doctors thought she had
leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   And in San Diego, a 2-year-old baby was hospitalized with
seizures after taking an Asian patent medicine, contaminated with a
potentially deadly chemical.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing numerous stories like these, state officials
caution that while imported herbal remedies can offer real
benefits, they also can be toxic.
</P>
<P>
   The California Department of Health has found dozens of imported
products contaminated with lead, mercury, arsenic or dangerous
chemicals. And it has identified cases in which mishandled or
mislabeled ingredients led to life-threatening injuries and deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``These medicines are coming into the U.S. as food products and,
by and large, food products are not tested,'' said Richard Ko, a
pharmacologist for the state health department, who has spearheaded
a campaign to detect contaminated imports. ``There needs to be a
change in the law in how we regulate these herbal products.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Asian remedies have rapidly gained popularity
in the United States, both inside and out of the Asian community.
But because the products are billed as natural, consumers may not
realize they need to treat them with caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``People assume that, because herbs are natural, they're safe,''
said Kerry Hartsough of the California Department of Consumer
Affairs, which licenses acupuncturists, who must be trained in
herbal medicine. ``There are a lot of things in nature that can be
deadly.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, Asian medicine has been practiced by herbalists
who mix each remedy individually from raw herbs. But such medicines
have become so popular, they are now being mass produced in foreign
factories _ and this has resulted in new types of contamination
problems.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, health experts have found that herbs used safely
in teas for hundreds of years become dangerous when manufactured
into pills and powders.
</P>
<P>
   In others, they have identified pollutants or drugs that in the
United States could only be sold by prescription. Finally, some
herbs wind up being dangerous simply because they are
misidentified.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, for instance, a 61-year-old Sacramento
acupuncturist was partially paralyzed after drinking an herbal tea
to help her arthritis. She had been sold the wrong herb. Instead of
taking the harmless flowering plant, Clematis Chinesis, she drank a
poisonous herb that is used as an ointment to treat genital warts.
The two plants look nearly identical.
</P>
<P>
   Ko believes most imported herbs and medicines are safe. The
problem for customers is that there is no easy way to identify the
contaminated ones.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current regulatory process, when products arrive in
the United States there is no routine, quality control testing to
verify their labeled contents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big problem,'' said Yvonne Lau, president of the
Oakland-based Mayway Herb Co., which became so concerned about the
uneven quality of herbs being exported from China that it
contracted with a Hong Kong university to conduct purity checks on
products it imports.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone gets sick, it gives Chinese medicine a bad name,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   In a few cases, injuries have resulted from mistakes made in the
United States, because people are not required to have any training
to dispense herbal medicines.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, a 25-year-old San Francisco woman died after drinking a
medicinal tea mixture purchased at an herb store to help her
sustain a pregnancy. The woman, who wanted to avoid another
miscarriage, began vomiting immediately after drinking the tea and
died within 2 1/2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Ko and other state toxicologists analyzed the tea. They found
that when laboratory rats were given components of the brew, they
died in as little as two and a half minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, they learned that an herb store clerk had
inadvertently put a wrong ingredient in the woman's tea mixture _ a
highly poisonous toad venom used in small doses in skin ointments.
</P>
<P>
   Cases like this have resulted in a call for stricter standards
on who can handle the most dangerous types of herbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very uncomfortable that people can prescribe a full line
of Chinese formulas without any training,'' said Lloyd Wright, a
Palo Alto acupuncturist who sat on the state Acupuncture Board for
five years. ``You're asking for trouble eventually.''
</P>

<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The state has documented dozens of cases in which products were
contaminated with toxins before importation from Asia.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the San Diego toddler, a product with a label
claiming it would treat vomiting and fever in infants turned out to
be contaminated with borneol, a highly toxic chemical that can
cause liver or kidney damage or death. The child survived.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the California health department analyzed 260
Asian patent medicines, products that contain premixed combinations
of herbs pressed into pills or capsules.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators discovered toxic ingredients in nearly a third of
the products. Twenty-four contained high levels of lead, 35
contained the poisonous heavy metal mercury and 36 were
contaminated with arsenic. Additionally, 17 products were spiked
with pharmaceutical drugs. One even had measurable amounts of the
poison strychnine.
</P>
<P>
   Ansenpunaw tablets, imported from China and advertised as ``a
brain tonic and sedative medicine,'' contained 1,000 times more
mercury than U.S. standards deem safe for consumption. Another
product, ``Double Dragon Pills,'' which listed such ingredients as
cow's bone glue and sea horse, had 30 times more lead than is
considered acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Lau said her company has had to reject some raw herbs grown in
China because they were contaminated in the farming process.
</P>
<P>
   ``China has a lot of industry and a lot of pollution,'' she
said. ``If your herb field is right next to a factory, the plants
just suck up the pollution.''
</P>
<P>
   In several cases, foreign manufacturers have been caught adding
pharmaceutical drugs to supposedly natural products exported to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the federal Food and Drug Administration stopped the
importation of five products purporting to be natural remedies for
diabetics, after a Marin County man suffered episodes of low blood
sugar while using one of them. An investigation revealed the
Chinese products had been spiked with a prescription drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these things should be regulated,'' said Dr. Kevin
Kobalter, a Marin endocrinologist who discovered the illegal
diabetes drugs when his patient started having problems. ``We need
to know what's in them and know it's pure.''

   BUSH-REFORM (Austin, Texas) _ For Gov. George W. Bush, reform
has been a matter of legislative proposals rather than an
overriding political philosophy, which might explain why few people
in Texas would have picked the word reformer when asked to describe
the governor. For Bush, success has come when changes have been
modest or when he has not had to buck political interests or

unusual corporate job changes in years, Lewis E. Platt, 58, left
Hewlett-Packard last year after 33 years, including a seven-year
term as chief executive, and promptly took the top job at
Kendall-Jackson Wine Estates. While Mr. Platt's new job certainly
seems romantic, his switch has also brought a management problem
that the textbooks do not discuss: how does an executive who has
already climbed his way to the top, and grown used to the trappings
that come with one of corporate America's plum jobs, start anew?
The question is particularly relevant because both the average age

   Food and dining stories from The N.Y. Times News Service for
Wednesday, March 15:

<P>
   NY-HUNTS-POINT (New York) _ The Hunts Point Terminal Market, the
giant wholesale produce market in the South Bronx, is the
waystation for the bulk of the fresh vegetables and fruits offered
in the city's restaurants and greengrocers _ the palest endive,
wrapped in tissue, the most tender baby artichokes and clusters of
moist green peanuts, still perfumed with the rich earth they left
in the Everglades the night before. And it is not just the domain
of professional buyers. Although the public is officially
discouraged from shopping there, persistent souls are tolerated if
they come prepared, and the thrill of a bargain there is enhanced
by the awe of being at a crossroads of world commerce, like Times
Square or the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. By Matt Lee and
Ted Lee.

   NY-RESTAURANTS-SMOKE (New York) _ For New Yorkers, smoking in
restaurants with more than 35 seats has been banned since 1995.
Anti-smoking advocates, content to have won the war over the dining
room, have shifted their crusade to the bar. But while fewer diners
may be consuming first or second-hand smoke, a newly hardened
resistance is digging in. Social and serial smokers are puffing
away at an underground network of restaurants that would rather
risk an inspection than alienate valued customers. By Rick Marin.

&HT;     CALIFORNIA'S CONSERVATIVE STREAK MAY BODE WELL FOR BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ZACHARY COILE and ROBERT SALLADAY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a strange way, the best news Texas Gov.
George W. Bush may have received from the California primary came
the next day, when 175 young people were arrested in San Francisco
protesting the passage of a tough-on-crime initiative that targets
teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   That California voters so strongly embraced Proposition 21, and
other Republican-backed measures on last week's ballot, was yet
another reminder of just how conservative voters in California can
be. This is the state, after all, of Ronald Reagan and Richard
Nixon, the state that overwhelmingly rejected affirmative action,
shut off services to illegal immigrants, and snubbed gay and
lesbian marriages.
</P>
<P>
   Looking toward November, political analysts say the presumptive
Democratic Party nominee for president, Vice President Al Gore, has
the advantage over the Republican Bush in California. Many voters
here agree with Gore on issues such as gun control and protecting
the right to have an abortion. Despite President Clinton's
scandals, he and Gore remain tremendously popular. And most
Republican candidates in California have fared dismally in recent
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for Bush, there are some hopeful signs. Republicans, excited
by a close contest, voted in much greater numbers in the March 7
primary than Democrats. And GOP strategists believe that if the
Texas governor runs as a centrist, he could break the Democrats'
lock on California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe George W. has a very difficult task here in
California,'' said Republican consultant Allan Hoffenblum. ``But I
hope the Democrats continue in their smugness, because once you
take the electorate for granted in California, they surprise you.''
</P>
<P>
   The primary results show that Gore has plenty to be smug about:
He won big in the primary among the traditional Democratic voters _
women, union members, Hispanics and blacks. In exit polls, the vice
president received twice as much support as Bush from moderates and
centrists, the key swing vote in November's election.
</P>
<P>
   The strong showing by Gore has led some analysts to speculate
that the Texas governor will write off California and focus on
states more attuned to his conservative message _ and where
advertising costs far less.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is California strategically the place he wants to do it?''
said Susan Rasky, a political scientist at the University of
California at Berkeley. ``He may be better off ceding it to Gore
(and) putting together an electoral majority without California.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore supporters are dismissive of Bush's chances in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. Bush cannot win California. You heard it here
first,'' said Garry South, Gov. Gray Davis' chief strategist who is
an unpaid adviser to the Gore campaign. ``We haven't had a winning
top-of-the-ticket Republican who wasn't pro-choice since 1988. Not
for president, not for governor, not for senator. That is a strike
against him right there, and that could be the kiss of death in and
of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republican strategists believe Bush can succeed in
California if he doesn't waver again from the ``compassionate
conservative'' message he used early in his bid for the presidency.
He turned sharply to the right to halt the momentum of Arizona Sen.
John McCain, the self-declared reformer who threatened Bush by
reaching out to moderate Republicans and independents in states
such as New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the nomination effectively his own, Bush is veering
back toward the center.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he finds his voice again and returns to compassionate
conservatism, which best exemplifies his record in Texas, and
communicates a message of less government ... in a way that
manifests tolerance and inclusion, then that is a compelling
message in the fall,'' said Steve Merksamer, a veteran Republican
strategist.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advertising emphasizes education and the overhaul of
managed care, and television spots show Bush with a variety of
ethnic groups. In speeches, Bush talks about how he reached out to
a variety of voters in Texas, where he received nearly 40 percent
of the Hispanic vote in his 1998 re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show more California voters identify themselves as
conservative than liberal, but by and large they are voting for
moderate Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you dig a bit deeper, you'll find that they are Clinton
Democrats _ for welfare reform, tough on crime, fiscally
conservative, but socially libertarian,'' said Del Ali, the
pollster for Research 2000 of Rockville, Md., which has conducted
surveys in California.

   WASHINGTON _ Plans are being laid for a visit by George W. Bush,
the GOP presidential candidate, to Europe ahead of this year's
election. The aim would be to help him get to know some of the
leading figures on the world stage, but also to reinforce his
stature. For Bush, a trip abroad is essential; his ignorance of
foreign affairs has become increasingly, and embarrassingly,
evident. Bush may be a fine man, but apparently he thinks that
Canada is run by a plate of chips and cottage cheese. &QL;

glacier in the far north of Canada last summer when they stumbled
on a human hip protruding from the ice. They looked down to see the
perfectly preserved body of a prehistoric man who had fallen into a
crevasse 12,000 years ago. The icemen have come back to humanity,
after thousands of years, because the glaciers that entombed them
are melting _ at an alarming rate _ all over the world. Glaciers
now are smaller than at any time in the past 5,000 years, while the
ice covers at both poles are melting. &QL;

political role of ex-president Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani _ once

revealed in Tehran. Rafsanjani is being linked to at least six

and intellectuals. The names are known in Iran but have never been

absolute performance of my tenure and, compared to the S&AMP;P, the
worst relative performance as well,'' he said in his famous letter
to shareholders, which is full of his usual flashes of wit and
wisdom. ``Even Inspector Clouseau could find last year's guilty
party: your chairman,'' Buffett acknowledged. &QL;

   TEHRAN _ Sunday morning, two men on a 1000cc motorbike shot and
critically wounded the editor-in-chief of an Iranian newspaper
which has repeatedly questioned the sinister activities of former
president Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. The victim, Saeed
Hajjarian, is a close friend and adviser of the reformist
president, Mohamed Khatami. And the motorbike? In Iran, 1000cc
motorcycles can only be used, by law, by members of the security

   WASHINGTON _ Plans are being laid for a visit by George W. Bush,
the GOP presidential candidate, to Europe ahead of this year's
election. The aim would be to help him get to know some of the
leading figures on the world stage, but also to reinforce his
stature. For Bush, a trip abroad is essential; his ignorance of
foreign affairs has become increasingly, and embarrassingly,
evident. Bush may be a fine man, but apparently he thinks that
Canada is run by a plate of chips and cottage cheese. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ Bill Hanlon and Warren Ward were out hunting on a
glacier in the far north of Canada last summer when they stumbled
on a human hip protruding from the ice. They looked down to see the
perfectly preserved body of a prehistoric man who had fallen into a
crevasse 12,000 years ago. The icemen have come back to humanity,
after thousands of years, because the glaciers that entombed them
are melting _ at an alarming rate _ all over the world. Glaciers
now are smaller than at any time in the past 5,000 years, while the
ice covers at both poles are melting. &QL;

 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A coalition representing businesses, labor,
housing advocates and legislators has announced a package of bills
to increase affordable housing in areas of California with high job
growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``In California, the mismatch between what people are earning
and what it takes to buy a home is staggering,'' said Allan
Zaremberg, president of the California Chamber of Commerce and a
chief member of the coalition supporting the Job Center Housing
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   High prices and low housing production over the past decade,
according to Zaremberg, compel many workers to seek lower-priced
homes at greater distances from their work or, in some cases, even
to seek work in other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The California Department of Finance estimates that a
``healthy'' jobs-to-housing ratio is one new home for every 1.5
jobs created. In San Francisco, the ratio is one new unit of
housing for every 6.54 jobs created.
</P>
<P>
   Based on 10-year forecasts for employment and housing, the Bay
Area will have a shortage of more than 320,000 homes by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad irony of our time that thousands of the union
construction workers ... are helping to build homes they cannot
afford to buy,'' said Jim Earp, executive director of the
California Alliance for Jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Proposed legislation in the Job Center Housing package would:
</P>
<P>
   _ Establish rewards for communities with rapid job growth to
approve new housing.
</P>
<P>
   _ Establish a fair system to resolve construction disputes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Require full disclosure of impacts of local growth-control
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   _ Promote timely use of redevelopment funds.
</P>
<P>
   _ Create a commission to study developing previously
contaminated sites.
</P>
<P>
   _ Increase funding for low- and moderate-income housing.

BRIDGING THE GAP BETWEEN CRIB AND BED  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Resending for the Times-Argus; moved 3/9.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Moving your toddler from the crib to a bed is like opening
Pandora's box: You can be in for a real surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not unusual to go from having a great sleeper to chaos
almost overnight,'' says pediatrician Richard Ferber, the nation's
preeminent children's sleep specialist. ``The child who never even
thought of getting out (of the crib) is now popping out of bed all
the time.'' The best age for the move is between 3 and 4, says
Ferber. Unfortunately, few parents wait that long, and even though
there may be a practical reason to do it, if a child is too young,
a move only creates new problems on top of the old ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unrealistic to expect a 2-year-old to have the
self-control to stay in a bed. It's not part of her developmental
equipment yet,'' says psychologist Jodi A. Mindell, author of
``Sleeping Through the Night'' (HarperPerennial). Her daughter is
33 months old ``and I don't see a big bed in her future any time
soon,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The most common reason parents move a toddler is to free the
crib for a new baby. ``That fuels the insecurity a child already
feels at having a new sibling, making her particularly needy,''
says Mindell.
</P>
<P>
   She says parents can buy up to three more months in the crib for
the toddler by finding a makeshift or alternative bed for the baby.
If that's not possible, move a toddler out of the crib at least six
weeks before the baby arrives. Whatever you do, she says, tell him,
``You're such a big boy, you need a big boy bed!'' not ``We need
the crib for the baby.'' One transition at a time Moving a child at
about the same time she's toilet training is almost always a bad
idea, even though it makes sense for her to have easier access to
the bathroom at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having both transitions at once robs a child of control at a
time when independence and control are developmentally what they
are pushing for,'' says pediatrician Shari Nethersole of Children's
Hospital in Boston. ``He's bound to resist.'' Her advice is to
complete one transition before tackling the other; logistically, it
makes sense if the move to the bed comes first.
</P>
<P>
   One way to gauge whether a toddler has the necessary control is
to try leaving him alone in a room for a few minutes during
playtime. ``Is he a kid who gets into trouble instantly,'' asks
Mindell, ``who cries because you've left or follows you out?'' If
the answer is yes, he's not ready.
</P>
<P>
   Sally Cronin wonders if she moved her daughter too soon. When
Madison was 18 months and climbed out of her crib, Cronin panicked:
``I didn't think she was safe.'' She and husband Tom took the crib
down immediately.
</P>
<P>
   In the near-year that has passed since then, Madison has slept
the night in her bed only once, the night before this interview.
Not that she was a great sleeper before that; she was often sick
and cried a lot, so Sally or Tom would bring her to their bed. But
her increased mobility has made matters much worse. That her
parents don't consistently return her to her bed doesn't help,
either, but Cronin wonders, too, if Madison was just too young.
</P>
<P>
   The day after she stayed in her bed for the first night she was
so proud of herself, she told her mom, ``I woke up and didn't come
in your room!'' Cronin found that interesting. ``She knows that's
what we want,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she just couldn't do it before.'' Exploring
alternatives The problem for parents like Cronin is often that they
don't realize they have alternatives, says Nethersole. For
instance, she recommends lowering the rails, putting a hefty layer
of cushions on the floor, and teaching a toddler to climb safely.
That's what our pediatrician recommended when my son was 18 months
and hurled himself out of the crib headfirst. It was almost as if
Eli just wanted to be empowered to climb, rather than to get out of
the crib: He never dived again and never climbed down at night
(during the day was a different story), and we didn't move him to a
bed for close to a year.
</P>
<P>
   The reason to delay the move as long as possible, of course, is
safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can get into a lot of trouble wandering the house alone
at night,'' says Nethersole.
</P>
<P>
   Delaying also enables us to maintain control. Once in a bed,
even a youngster who was previously an excellent sleeper can have
difficulty settling down for the night. With the newfound freedom,
he's more aware of and enticed by activity in the rest of the
house. ``They pop in and out of bed and you can't enforce
anything,'' says Ferber, whose book, ``Solve Your Child's Sleep
Problems'' (Simon and Shuster), is the bible on the subject. Ferber
is director of the Center for Pediatric Sleep Disorders at
Children's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   His solution is a gate, either at the top of the stairs or on
the bedroom door. Many parents resist, saying it feels too
zoo-like, but Ferber says it actually feeds into a youngster's
developmental need. Here's why: What begins as a rule - ``It's your
job to stay in bed'' - typically escalates into threats and
punishment - ``If you don't stay in bed, no TV tomorrow!'' -
because parents get so frustrated at lack of compliance. The
problem, as Cronin suggests, is that a child under 3 is not capable
of complying.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may cognitively grasp that you'll be angry, but the open
door beckons and they can't control the impulse,'' says Ferber. At
the same time, however, ``they don't enjoy the chaos when parents
are angry and yelling,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if anything, it makes them feel more insecure and
unsafe, pushing them to act out even more in an effort to get you
to set a limit that makes them feel safe again.
</P>
<P>
   The gate is that limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the parent's job to offer the control the child can't
provide himself,'' says Ferber. He says a gate can turn bad nights
into good ones within two nights.
</P>
<P>
   When beds don't measure up For some children, it's not the
newfound access to the rest of the house that's the problem. They
simply don't like the bed.
</P>
<P>
   Katie Faulkner was 2 when she began to outgrow her crib. Her
parents wisely waited six more months to move her, until she was
bumping into the sides while she slept. Even so, she rarely sleeps
the night in the bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had a comfort level with the crib that hasn't been matched
by the bed,'' says her dad, Mark.
</P>
<P>
   Nethersole says that's not unusual. ``The crib is familiar and
cozy. Kids feel snuggled there - safe,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Guardrails can provide that security for some children, but they
may not provide as much protection as parents think. Cronin says
Madison moved around so much on a twin bed she was afraid she'd
roll off, even with the rails. She bought a slightly smaller junior
bed that was lower to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   One trick to ease transition is to keep the crib up after you
move the bed in so a child chooses where she wants to sleep. As
long as you have the space for both and can tolerate the back and
forth - naps in the bed, nights in the crib, etc. - this is a
respectful way to give a child control, says Mindell.
</P>
<P>
   For a child who is truly miserable with the bed, for whom
bedtime is a nightly struggle, and who has gone from being a good
sleeper to a bad one, Mindell would bring the crib back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick is in the spin you put on it,'' she says. Not ``I
guess you're not a big girl'' or ``You can't handle this,'' but:
``Oh look! Your crib missed you, too! It came back!'' Hopefully, of
course, it won't come to that. When we don't rush children and set
limits for them, says Mindell, the transition to a bed can be as
smooth as, well, silk sheets.
</P>

important as voting. For some ideas on how to do that, check out

   &QL; 
TIPS FOR PARENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Place the bed in the same position in the room as the crib so a
child's perspective on the room doesn't change.
</P>
<P>
   A child isn't too old for a crib until 4.
</P>
<P>
   A consistent routine that includes reading makes bedtime easier.
Keep the routine the same when you move him.
</P>
<P>
   If possible, involve a child in choosing the bed or sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about the attributes of a bed. ``This bed is special; it's
just for you. It's so big and comfortable and it can still be cozy:
Look how much your stuffed animals like it!'' Some children never
pop in and out of bed during the night. Be careful not to plant the
idea that they can. Not: ``The rule is you can't get in and out of
bed,'' but: ``When you go to bed, call us if you need us, just like
before.'' Shutting a child behind a closed door for the night is
not safe.
</P>
<P>
   Some guardrails are not safe because they leave a large space
between the bottom rung and the mattress. A child's arm, leg, or
head could get caught.
</P>
<P>
   It can take a month for a child to get used to the bed.
</P>
<P>
   Tell a child who doesn't like a gate, ``Let's try it without the
gate and see if you need this help or not.'' If a child is having
sleep problems, don't assume it's because she hates the crib, and
don't make this a reason to move her. Try instead to figure out
what makes sleep an issue and work on that directly. For instance,
is there an underlying tension in the family? Does she have
difficulty with other separations? Do you use the crib as a
discipline technique so that she has negative associations with it?

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Dancing around religion and
politics
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ My wife had been talking with a Pentecostal
preacher, and the subject of dancing came up.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wasn't in favor of dancing, being a Pentecostal
preacher.
</P>
<P>
   She said she didn't dance, being a Baptist.
</P>
<P>
   He did amend his opinion for this exception: It's all right when
you are moved by the Spirit, as was King David in the Old
Testament.
</P>
<P>
   My wife was telling me about their talk. She knows I like to
dance. It's just her way of rubbing me the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   I told her whenever I think of King David, I think of George
Bush, the elder. I explained:
</P>
<P>
   As you may recall from Sunday school, David fell in love with
Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah the Hittite, a faithful soldier in the
king's army.
</P>
<P>
   To get rid of him, David had Uriah sent to the front lines of
the hottest battle. After he was killed, David married Bathsheba.
</P>
<P>
   But God sent the prophet Nathan before King David to accuse him.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan did so by relating a story of a rich man who had extended
flocks of sheep but who grew jealous of one poor man who possessed
only a single ewe, which he loved dearly.
</P>
<P>
   It was the rich man, Nathan told David, who had arranged to have
the other killed so that he could take the ewe.
</P>
<P>
   ``And David's anger,'' the Bible says, ``was greatly kindled
against the man; and he said to Nathan, As the Lord liveth, the man
that haith done this thing shall surely die ...
</P>
<P>
   ``And Nathan said to David, Thou (ital)art(endital) the man.''
</P>
<P>
   Skipping ahead, George Bush's first nomination for president
came in 1988 at the GOP convention in New Orleans. I was there and
remember it well.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who sometimes could come across as namby-pamby, gave a
powerful acceptance speech, listing one by one the qualities that
America needed in a president _ leadership, strength of purpose,
integrity, etc. _ punctuating each with this stirring proclamation:
</P>
<P>
   ``I (ital)AM(endital) that man!''
</P>
<P>
   I've always wondered if the speech writer was paraphrasing the
prophet Nathan.
</P>
<P>
   If so, it's funny how you could take a damnation and turn it
into an affirmation.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's not so funny, politics being politics.
</P>
<P>
   But I did think it hilarious every time Bush would declare, ``I
(ital)AM(endital) that man!'' _ as if, it seemed to me, he were
bragging about having bedded Bathsheba.
</P>
<P>
   That's what I told my wife. I know she likes George Bush. That's
just my way of rubbing her the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   My wife was quiet for a moment. Then she said this: that perhaps
it would be better if from now on we didn't discuss politics or,
for that matter, the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   Gee.
</P>
<P>
   Can't talk about religion. Can't talk about politics.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't leave much.
</P>
<P>
   Might as well. Can't dance.

VISITING THE BIG DRIP _ VICTORIA FALLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VICTORIA FALLS, Zimbabwe _ Boston has the Big Dig. Zimbabwe has
the Big Drip (a.k.a. Victoria Falls). They are huge phenomena, and
maybe kindred spirits because their common theme seems to be
``eternally yours.''
</P>
<P>
   However, this gargantuan African jungle waterfall probably has
the better chance of moistly making it into the 22d century, even
though the Dig's overflow (in price) is currently pretty
impressive, and might take that long to be covered.
</P>
<P>
   Named for a lady of virtually permanent presence, Queen
Victoria, as were innumerable places of imposing natural and human
architecture during her 64 years on the British throne, the Drip is
surely the most glorious of them all. Noisy as an unending
cannonading salute to her majesty, and more majestic than anything
her poets laureate could have conjured, this wilderness Victoria _
Vicky of the Vines? _ descends with a crash surpassing the stock
market of '29. Yet that brute force splinters and reforms as silken
clouds wafting heavenward like angels' negligees.
</P>
<P>
   Am I getting carried away here? Swept over the brink like the
wide Zambezi River? Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   A Jekyll-Hyde waterway, the Zambezi meanders placidly,
unsuspectingly to the edge . . . and then helplessly takes the
plunge, morphing into a foaming monster that seethes and rages 328
feet straight down the volcanic rock face.
</P>
<P>
   Gushing, rushing, flushing . . . .
</P>
<P>
   The rush of tons upon tons of water is transfixing for the
witness. Hypnotic. Mesmerizing. It is even cleansing, as the sight
of so much free-spirited water ought to be, a rinsing-out of the
neural mush.
</P>
<P>
   Unhesitatingly, this lusty hydrobabe, Vicky, throws herself in
your face. Full-frontal fluidity, and you can't take your damp eyes
off her. You're up-close and so personal that she's utterly
overpowering, twice as tall as Niagara Falls and a lot broader.
Your ringside location is no more than 150 to 200 feet away as you
make contact _ eyeball to high fall _ across a steep chasm.
</P>
<P>
   Splashing, dashing, bashing . . . .
</P>
<P>
   There's no stopping her perpetual commotion _ the hustle,
bustle, and muscle of this down-and-flirty goddess seducing your
senses. Water, water everywhere, and every drop makes you blink.
Actually, the falls is a two-country split with the shorter east
end next door as the property of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
   Although Victoria Falls is a tourist town where the T-shirt,
knick-knack, and postcard flourish in the usual manner, the falls
itself is considerably removed from commercialism in a
well-preserved World Heritage enclave, probably not much different
from 1855 when Scottish clergyman David Livingstone was supposedly
the first non-native to take in the vista. What is different is
that he's still surveying the scene he baptized in the name of his
queen _ as a statue. Since he was none other than the renowned
missionary-explorer, you may mutter, ``Dr. Livingstone, I
presume!'' while nodding to his bronze visage.
</P>
<P>
   Checking into the old, elegant Victoria Falls Hotel, a pillared
masterpiece of creamy stone left over from the days of Empire when
Zimbabwe was Rhodesia, you are urged to the immaculate gardens in
the rear for a ``first glimpse.''
</P>
<P>
   Glimpse of what? A forest fire, perhaps, as smoke rises above
the tree line a mile distant?
</P>
<P>
   Esther Gwekwerere, an excellent guide, laughs. ``Nothing's
burning. That's the mist the falls sends up. Some days it's so
dense you can't see the falls at all. But we'll be all right today.
Can't you hear them? The local people call it `the smoke that
thunders' ''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah _ there is a far-off throb, a prelude to the divine deluge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like the purring of cheetahs,'' she says. ``Let's go. As we
move closer they will roar more like a pride of lions.''
</P>
<P>
   The pride of Zimbabwe is looming, booming, fuming. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Steam soars as though from a kettle of witch's brew. Decibels
increase to an incessant, throaty, deafening ``Wuuuuuhh!'' Esther
has seen the falls almost daily for 15 years, yet remains eager,
stimulated. ``It's different every time. Depends on the season, the
weather, the day. You want ear plugs?'' she asks with a grin.
</P>
<P>
   Rumbling, grumbling, tumbling . . ..
</P>
<P>
   Your water bill is $10 US. A sawbuck (for foreigners) to get
through the modest gate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do I think I left the water running at the hotel?'' says
my friend Aurelio.
</P>
<P>
   Why do I think I should call a plumber?
</P>
<P>
   Quickly a walk through the trees brings us abruptly to the
initial confrontation, Devil's Cataract, pouring forth fiendishly
as an individual separated from the mainstreaming. A drenched,
slippery stairway leads down the cliff to a platform where you feel
inundated. Esther offers umbrellas. No thanks. So it's a re-take of
Goldie Hawn beneath the water bucket on ``Laugh-In''? But, what the
heck _ we didn't have time for a shower before catching the very
early plane from Harare.
</P>
<P>
   Soaking, smoking, stoking . . ..
</P>
<P>
   A helicopter's-eye-view is available. Exciting and informative,
it takes in the whole big picture, the falls in entirety for the
1.2-mile distance plus the Zambezi's Zs: the zigzagging gorges that
the river has dug while recovering from its cataclysmic fall and
coursing toward Mozambique, subsequently the Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't have the intimacy of the walk near the wild side,
along a paved path that winds through a rain forest. A tangled,
tropical canopy of olives, strangler figs, ebony acacias, palms,
red milkwoods, and maiden hair ferns, it is infiltrated by
gossiping vervet monkeys and birds of many colors and songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baboons love the figs,'' says Esther, ``but let's have a few
they missed.'' A sweet snack. ``Lions have been known to show up to
gaze at the falls. And warthogs.''
</P>
<P>
   The path, moving eastward, exits the thicket at regular
intervals to arrive at observation posts and more head-on stares at
vigorous Vicky. She is an ever-lowering curtain, rippled like
chenille.
</P>
<P>
   Spraying, spewing, spitting . . ..
</P>
<P>
   At one point the audio remains solidly on loudest but the video
is blanked impenetrably by a whiteout, a frothy coverup. Spooky,
even on this sunny day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry,'' says Esther. ``It'll be clear the rest of the
way.''
</P>
<P>
   And it is. Horseshoe Falls, the principal aquatic avalanche, is
cascading brilliantly, impersonating a ski slope.
</P>
<P>
   Spilling, milling, thrilling . . ..
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, don't cry over spilt water,'' Aurelio chides me as I
kerchief my face.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not weeping. It's just the spray. But I know I'm gaping and
gawking. ``Zakanaka!'' I yip, having learned from Esther the Shona
word for beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Here the water seems to descend lazily, in slow motion,
declining to batter the river below as much, so you can tell that
it's pullman green. Misted trees and grass glisten silver in the
sunshine, and rainbows dance across the gorge like painted halos.
In this sector the delicate plumes of water are entrancing, liquid
loveliness taking on shapes of sprites and nymphs that frolic with
the rainbows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're waterlogged,'' says Aurelio. ``Overhydrated.''
</P>
<P>
   There is more to Vicky, but not in this country past Danger
Point, the rim of Zimbabwe. A deep cut separates Zimbabwe from
Zambia, and we can walk no farther east. Retracing our steps
slowly, we're in no hurry to leave.
</P>
<P>
   A taxi will take us over the Victoria Falls Bridge (location of
an idiot's delight bungee jump, 200 feet for $100) and into Zambia.
Ten bucks is the price of admission to this end of the falls, too,
buying a visa.
</P>
<P>
   As rainbows abound, the Zambian waterworks are no less fabulous
as Vicky, high, wide, and handsome, spreads herself wondrously
across borders. It's a wetter and louder stroll beside the Eastern
Cataract because the dipping, tilting path among hanging vines and
date palms is closer to the edge and the gap narrower. Ambling in a
rainstorm (even though it's not raining _ just misting mightily )
you are more cautious than before because the path (called Knife
Edge), slopes, and is banana-peel slick. Moreover, no fences
separate it from the precipice as they do over in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, when a Swede lost his footing and plummeted
fatally from the cliff and into the swirl called Boiling Pot, the
Swedish government offered to build railings. The Zambians said no
thanks, feeling that would be cheating, and opted to keep the
setting as natural as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally wonderful is the Big Drip. Never has H2O been more
ravishing.
</P>
<P>
   Dripping, ripping, gripping . . ..

TO SUCCEED, YOU MUST BE MARRIED TO `THE MASSACHUSETTS MAFIA' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH   HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Their names are familiar. They control lots of money in
the neighborhood. They want first dibs on hot deals. And they don't
want you coming around again if performance is poor the first time
around.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and if you are performing, they want to own a piece of you
forever.
</P>
<P>
   People in the finance world call them ``the Massachusetts
Mafia.'' They're the handful of high-profile venture capital firms
that tend to dominate early-stage financing. They're the Who's Who
of start-up money, and every entrepreneur tries to wow them.
</P>
<P>
   Charter members of the club include Charles River Ventures,
Matrix Partners, North Bridge Venture Partners, Polaris Venture
Partners, and Battery Ventures. A few others that make the cut are
Greylock Management Corp., Alta Partners, and OneLiberty Ventures.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, these firms like to get in early, wield a
heavy influence on the companies in which they invest, and reap big
returns. They compete not just with their deep pockets but with the
management help and important talent introductions they offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money is a commodity,'' said Andrew Payne, chief executive of
Revenio Inc., a marketing software company in Burlington. ``It's
the people that are special.''
</P>
<P>
   Payne wanted investors who would roll up their sleeves with him,
not those who wanted a more complete plan upfront: ``That's the old
world _ entrepreneurs, please form line here.''
</P>
<P>
   Revenio's first-round backers _ to the tune of $16 million _ are
none other than Charles River and Matrix. Payne went to the funding
table with the advantage of a track record. A founder of software
success Open Market Inc., he is called ``one of the brightest
talents'' in the industry by Charles River Principal Ted
Dintersmith. The firm waited a year to back his project.
</P>
<P>
   After more high-fat breakfast meetings than he cares to recall,
Payne says he ultimately judged the VCs on their experience and
contacts. Angel investors _ individuals who make early-stage
investments _ can't offer the same jump-start, he suggests. ``It
wasn't a step that I felt would speed us up.''
</P>
<P>
   Renan Levy, chief executive of eSupportNow, a Medford-based
provider of online customer service and sales, says he talked to
fewer than 10 venture firms before settling on Polaris and Atlas
Ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking at tier one,'' he says. ``There are probably
five to 10 strong companies that, anywhere you go, you hear their
names.''
</P>
<P>
   Levy, too, had prior experience with a large company. When he
started eSupportNow, he went from managing 1,500 people to juggling
multiple duties as a one-man show. ``I was shoveling the snow in
front of the building. I was fixing the (light) bulbs, and making
sure the heat was working,'' Levy says.
</P>
<P>
   As he grew, people choices were important to him _ even when it
came to venture capital. ``You need to have the right chemistry
with the people,'' he says. ``They're going to be on your board.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Ingari, chief executive of Wheelhouse Corp., a Burlington
company that helps companies with online marketing strategy, landed
funding in a snap because of his prior experience as chief
executive of Shiva Corp. He got $8.3 million from Charles River and
Silicon Valley bigwigs Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers.
</P>
<P>
   But before starting Wheelhouse, he helped start-ups get
financing, so he knows the drill well.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every town, there's a hierarchy of firms,'' Ingari says.
``Entrepreneurs often make the mistake that if they can't get into
Charles River or Polaris or Greylock, they can't live. It's just
not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Skip ``the Mafia'' if your research shows they shun your
business sector, or if they're already married to your biggest
rival. There are plenty of other good firms, Ingari notes, ``This
is a very, very strong venture capital town.''

</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley's Bowman Capital is leading the deal. Locally,
Charles River and Bessemer Ventures were early backers.

   Taqua chief David Michaud says his company's next-generation

IT'S MAPLE SUGARING TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the sweetest time of year in New England _ maple sugaring
season.
</P>
<P>
   In Vermont, which leads the nation in maple syrup production
with 31 percent of the total crop, Governor Howard Dean officially
started the season this week with a tree-tapping ceremony at the
Trapp Family Lodge in Stowe.
</P>
<P>
   Once you try the real stuff, you'll never go back to the
supermarket flavoring on your pancakes. And maple syrup season is a
grand time to get a taste for the real stuff.
</P>
<P>
   From now through mid-April, sugarhouses throughout New England
will be welcoming visitors to see how the syrup is produced _ it
takes 40 gallons of maple sap to make one gallon of syrup _ and to
sample the product on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to make a quick getaway to watch this 300-year-old
tradition taking place. (The season is quiet, so you should have no
trouble finding room at some delightful country inns.) Trees are
tapped and buckets are hung from them to catch the syrup flow. The
syrup is then taken to a sugarhouse where it is boiled to produce
the final product.
</P>
<P>
   One of the treats when visiting a sugarhouse is to sample
``sugar on snow'': Syrup is thickened on a stove, then poured
quickly over fresh snow or ice crystals to create a tasty product
rather like taffy in its consistency. Besides the pure syrup, other
products include maple candy or maple cream, a table spread that is
delicious on breads or pastries.
</P>
<P>
   At Vermont's tree tapping, festivities begin at 9:30 a.m. at the
Trapp sugarhouse, with Dean, joined by members of the Lamoille
Maple Sugarmakers Association, tapping the first tree at 11 a.m.
Vermont has lots of sugarhouses. Vermont Welcome Centers, located
on major highways upon entering the state, have brochures on
locations and events as well as information on great places to
stay.
</P>
<P>
   Maple lovers will not want to miss St. Albans' 32d annual
Vermont Maple Festival, April 28-30. For more information on maple
season in Vermont, call 800-VERMONT and ask for a listing of farm
products, or check out www.state.vt.us/agric/vtfarms!/maple.htm.
</P>
<P>
   While Vermont is not that far away, right here in the Bay State,
there are plenty of sugarhouses. In Shrewsbury, Green Hill Farm
(508-842-2588) offers not only maple products but horse-drawn
sleigh rides to the sugarbush. A maple museum and sugarhouse tour
are found at Maple Corner Farm in Granville (413-357-8829). For
those who want to know more about maple sugaring and locations of
sugarhouses, call the Massachusetts Maple Producers Association at
(413) 628-3912 or log onto www.massmaple.org.
</P>
<P>
   The Salem Cross Inn in West Brookfield (508-867-2345) offers
Maple Gatherings each week during the sugaring season. These
multicourse dinners feature maple in creative entrees and
appetizers.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, the Rosewood Country Inn has a March 17-19
getaway that offers two nights' lodging, a chance to visit area
sugarhouses, sleigh rides, breakfasts, and more beginning at $129 a
person. Call 800-938-5273.

   St. Patrick's Day &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   St. Patrick's Weekend is a grand time to visit Boston, perhaps
the most Irish city in America. For March 17-19, there are lots of
things to do. Among them: a Faneuil Hall Marketplace party March
17; a St. Patrick's Cruise with Odyssey Cruises for Irish food,
music, and stepdancers;the annual Boston City Hall Plaza party
(with the ``best Irish coffee'' contest 11:30 a.m.-4 p.m.) March
18; and the St. Patrick's Parade on March 19 beginning at 1 p.m.
Other ideas for the weekend include following the Irish Heritage
Trail (for a map and information, on the Internet go to
www.IrishHeritageTrail.com), visiting the John F. Kennedy Library &AMP;
Museum, which honors the first Irish Catholic president (the museum
is showing a film about Kennedy's Irish ancestry); and viewing the
Irish Famine Memorial at the corner of School and Washington
streets. If you want to make a weekend of it, the Boston Park Plaza
Hotel has a St. Patrick's overnight that includes an Irish dinner,
breakfast, and a gift.
</P>
<P>
   For more on the weekend, call 888-SEE-BOSTON or visit
www.BostonUSA.com.
</P>
<P>
   March 17 is a legal holiday in Boston (Suffolk County), not for
St. Patrick but to mark Evacuation Day, when the Redcoats evacuated
the city 225 years ago. The local commander for George Washington
was General John Sullivan of Limerick. Guess what the password for
the Continental troops was that day? Limerick. In South Boston,
where the parade will be held, there's a towering monument marking
the spot where the cannons were placed to force the British out.
And when the first parade was held in 1901, many Bostonians were
against a St. Patrick's parade, so the parade was authorized ``as a
public commemoration of the evacuation of Boston in 1776.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyoke, in Western Massachusetts, claims the second-largest St.
Patrick's Parade in the United States. It takes place March 19.

RECESSION IN JAPAN SHRINKS GDP, NIKKEI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Japanese economy, which has struggled for eight years under
a start-and-stop recovery, has again taken a turn for the worse.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's Economic Planning Agency reported Monday that the
economy contracted 1.4 percent in the October-December quarter,
officially sending the world's second-biggest economy back into
recession.
</P>
<P>
   Economists said the decline highlighted Japan's difficulty
shaking off a slump triggered by a pop in the stock market and real
estate bubble more than a decade ago. Japan's economic slump,
officially dating since 1992, is the worst and longest endured by
an industrial country in the post-World War II period.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economic number indicates the worst isn't over yet,'' said
William Wendler, vice president of Rowe Price-Fleming
International, an investment adviser to mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to bad economic news, the Nikkei index of 225 stocks
plunged 560.47 Monday, or almost 3 percent, to close at 19,189.93.
</P>
<P>
   Other Asian markets followed, including Hong Kong's Hang Seng
index, which declined 735.18, or more than 4 percent, to 17,096.68.
</P>
<P>
   Despite strong gains in the Nikkei in 1999 _ gains driven by a
run-up in Japan's technology sector _ Japan's main stock index has
returned to only half of its all-time high of 38,915.87, achieved
in December 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth-quarter slowdown reported Monday compounded the
effects of a third-quarter contraction. The official definition of
recession is two consecutive quarters of economic decline.
</P>
<P>
   The basic problem inf Japan's economy has been a failure of
consumer spending to ignite and gain momentum.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three months of 1999, consumer demand declined 1.6
percent, while housing investment, another measure of consumer
confidence, tumbled 5.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth-quarter decline came as the effects of a huge public
works spending package and tax cuts passed in late 1998, which
stimulated demand by a national of 120 million people, began to
wear off, Japan experts said. Public investment, which includes
spending on public works, fell by 5.4 percent in the final quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to soften the bad news, government officials have been
saying the economy could pull out of its slump this year as the
financial sector and old-line Japanese businesses begin to see
benefits from a sweeping restructuring of the nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
   One of Japan's major newspapers, Nihon Keizai Shimbun, quoted a
government official over the weekend who said the government this
month would report the economy shows ``signs of staging a
self-sustaining recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are restructuring changes going on in the private and
government sector, and this we have to overcome so we expected some
hard times,'' said Ryuichi Hattori, head of economic affairs for
the Consulate General of Japan in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The government expects the economy to grow in the January-March
quarter, Hattori said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, growth has eluded Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The recession started in the third quarter of 1992, after a
collapse in stock and real estate prices began to drag down the
entire economy and weaken the banking sector, which had heavily
invested in stocks and property. Since then, the economy has
struggled through four recessions, which are punctuated by periods
of weak growth and hopes of a full-fledged recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Economists see bright signs in the government's latest economic
report, which said there was a 4.6 percent increase in capital
spending by businesses last quarter. It was the best quarter for
capital spending since mid-1995; Japanese companies followed the
example of their US counterparts by investing in computers and
information technology. Industrial production and machinery orders
have also increased over the past several months.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Posen, a Japan expert and senior fellow at the Institute
for International Economics in Washington, said the corporate
outlays were encouraging. He said a pickup in corporate spending
typically precedes a pickup in consumer spending as a country pulls
out of recession.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he noted that a decline in consumer spending was the
result of positive steps by Japanese companies to restructure,
which included cutting back on employee bonuses, overtime, and
wages overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers are definitely bad, but people shouldn't look at
them as though we're going back into a terrible state,'' Posen
said.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's minister of finance, Kiichi Miyazawa, made a similar
argument to the Diet in January, saying that Japan must reduce its
reliance on public-sector stimulus to the economy and ``pass the
baton from public to private demand and put the economy back onto a
path toward full recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hiromi Murakami, research associate for the Economic
Strategy Institute in Washington, said he was more pessimistic. He
argued the Japanese government needs to do more to foster economic
recovery, especially by restructuring an economy increasingly
viewed as rigid and outmoded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan has been suffering for such a long time,'' said
Murakami. A general election this year could prolong the
government's gridlock. The Liberal Democratic Party, which is
viewed as antireform and protective of farming and small-business
interests, is trying to hold onto its coalition in the lower Diet,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Government spending programs, such as those enacted two years
ago and again recently, ``can be a temporal effect like we saw in
early 1999, but it doesn't seem like the fundamental economic
recovery.''

&HT;     A GIANT LEAP IN ERGONOMIC COMFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAVE MURPHY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Basketball coach Bobby Knight likes to throw
them, executives like to spin in them as they count their money,
and television stars like to fool around in them. But chairs are
rarely a hot topic for water cooler conversations. Mostly they just
sort of sit in the background.
</P>
<P>
   A $35 million chair may change all that. That is how much it
cost Steelcase to design its Leap chair, a four-year project aimed
at changing the basic foundation of the office chair.
</P>
<P>
   But the Leap doesn't come cheap. A typical model has a list
price of about $1,000, which no doubt would make Knight throw a
fit. He could toss around dozens of folding chairs and a few
expletives for that price.
</P>
<P>
   If you think your boss would react pretty much the same way if
you requested such a chair, consider the big argument in favor of
the Leap: ergonomics. In an era when more workers are using
computers for hours at a time, anything that reduces the risk of
repetitive stress injuries, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, could
save a company far more than $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   According to 1997 figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics, people with carpal tunnel syndrome were absent from
work for a median of 25 days. By comparison, the typical worker who
had an amputation missed 18 days.
</P>
<P>
   Bad ergonomics can lead to other injuries and assorted
headaches, backaches and neck aches, of course. Even when those
ailments don't cause people to miss work, they can disrupt their
focus and sap their energy.
</P>
<P>
   Can the Leap prevent some of those injuries? It is too early to
tell, since the chair has been around only since August, but it's
clearly better than any ``ergonomic'' chair I've seen. A co-worker
and I tested the Leap for a few weeks, and here are the
similarities and differences between it and a typical ergonomic
chair, which costs about one-third as much:
</P>
<P>
   The arms on both chairs can be raised and lowered separately,
but the Leap's armrests have three advantages. They are padded, you
can move them closer to your body and you can turn them at an angle
so that your hands are closer together than your elbows are.
</P>
<P>
   Having support for your arms limits the risk of RSI. In most
chairs, though, the armrests are fixed at a 90-degree angle to the
keyboard, and they have to be far enough apart to accommodate your
hips. That means your arms are often at a different angle than 90
degrees, especially if you are using the smaller keyboard of a
laptop computer.
</P>
<P>
   In the Leap, you can move the base of the seat forward or back
without changing the rest of the chair. That helps shorter people,
who often have trouble with a typical chair; if they sit against
the backrest, as they should, their legs are usually uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   The front part of the seat also can be adjusted up or down
without affecting the rest of the seat. That allows the back of
your legs to get a little support, but not any uncomfortable
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The backrest of the ergonomic chair can be tilted, but the
Leap's back reclines only if you lean against it. On the Leap, you
can adjust how much resistance you get as you lean back, as well as
setting the maximum for how far you want to go. Unlike some chairs,
you never have that momentary fear that you are about to fall
backward.
</P>
<P>
   As you lean back, the base of the seat also slides forward,
allowing you to keep the basic support in your lower back.
</P>
<P>
   The ergonomic chair has a fixed pad for lumbar support, but the
back of the Leap lets you adjust the firmness of that pad. The Leap
also has extra pads for both the left and right sides of your back
that can be raised and lowered independently, giving support
wherever you want it for the lower or middle part of your back.
</P>
<P>
   My colleague who tried the chair, Christine Delsol, had just
returned from a few weeks off work with RSI. Delsol said she would
have liked the Leap's arm pads to adjust forward and backward as
well as side to side, and she would have preferred another support
pad for the upper back, but added that the chair is far better than
what she normally uses.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Wilder, director of shared services at Arthur Andersen
in San Francisco, recently bought about 900 of the chairs for
Andersen employees here.. There, too, the response has been
favorable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just about everybody in our office uses a computer _ either a
desktop or laptop,'' Wilder said. ``The adjustability is what they
really like. It's for all sizes of users.''
</P>
<P>
   Steelcase also makes the Criterion chair, which has been the
best-selling chair in the world, said Leap Product Manager Ken
Tameling. He is certain the Leap will pass it, even though the
Criterion sells for about 25 percent less. ``It's the
fastest-selling chair that we've ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   The chair we tried was a mid-price model. Some with fewer
features list for about $700, while others with more upscale design
and upholstery _ but the same ergonomic features we had _ can cost
twice that.
</P>
<P>
   Details about the chair are available on Steelcase's Web site
(www.steelcase.com).
</P>
<P>
   Is the Leap worth the leap in the price of a chair? If you spend
hours each day typing on a computer, it could be just what the
doctor ordered.

OLDER DOGS GETTING BACK ON TRACK WITH NEW TRICKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Natural Microsystems is in the process of reinventing itself.
</P>
<P>
   The small Framingham, Mass. high-tech company has been around
since 1983 without much to show for its efforts. Profits have been
skimpy. The stock has been up and down. The downs have been awfully
low.
</P>
<P>
   But for the past few years Natural Microsystems has been
repositioning itself to get in on the boom in telecommunications.
Wall Street likes what it sees. The stock has gone from $3 last
April to $76.25 Monday and at least one analyst says there is more
to come. ``There is no reason this stock shouldn't reach $100 by
the end of the year,'' said Ted Jackson of US Bancorp Piper
Jaffray.
</P>
<P>
   Natural Microsystems is not an isolated case. While most of the
glory in high-tech has gone to start-ups, a few older companies
have managed to share in the wealth. Call them old dogs who have
learned new tricks. Like Natural Microsystems, they are small
companies that have struggled. More often than not, Wall Street has
ignored them. But by changing direction, sometimes radically, they
have managed to catch the latest waves in technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them are smart and some are lucky,'' said Phil Fine, a
money manager with Loomis Sayles.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, Interleaf certainly fits the bill. The Waltham software
company was facing delisting of its stock when it decided in 1997
to bet its future on XML, a hot new technology for Web publishing.
The stock, which dipped to $2 at the beginning of 1999, was trading
for $77.375 Monday.
</P>
<P>
   NetOptix Corp. of Sturbridge had tried and failed a series of
high-tech ventures before getting into the business of fiber-optic
communications. Its stock was trading at $159.875 Monday, up from
less than $4 a year ago. Both NetOptix and Interleaf recently have
been acquired, although neither deal has closed.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, Interleaf, NetOptix, and Natural Microsystems all
lost money last year. None are bona fide success stories yet. But
on Wall Street, what counts is not where you've been, but where
you're going.
</P>
<P>
   For Natural Microsystems, that emphasis on the future is a good
thing because the company's past is nothing to write home about.
For most of its life the firm supplied telecommunications products
to businesses. By 1997 sales had reached $75 million. But chief
executive Robert Schecter decided bigger opportunities lay
elsewhere. Instead of selling to business customers, the company
had to sell gear to the Lucents, Nortels, and Siemens of the world,
the giant firms that are building the communications networks of
the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be the arms merchants to those guys,'' said
Schecter.
</P>
<P>
   A Lotus veteran, Schecter had some experience with reinvention.
He was at Lotus when the software giant transformed itself from a
spreadsheet company to a communications company. That experience
taught him a lesson: Change is hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Transitions are doable,'' said Schecter, ``but to pull them
off you have to go through some ugly times and recognize that not
everyone who was with you at the beginning will be with you at the
end.''
</P>
<P>
   Natural Microsystems has experienced all of that. The company
had to retool its sales force and all its products. Its old
business tailed off as expected, but the new business took longer
to get going than anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   The result: major losses in 1998 and 1999 as Schecter spent
money on the new ventures before revenues materialized. Herbert
Tinger, an analyst with First Albany, said many on Wall Street,
himself included, urged the company to cut costs to help the bottom
line. Schecter stuck to his guns. ``He made the right decision,''
Tinger admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Schecter is proud of the fact that most of his core engineering
crew stuck with him ``as we managed our way through the abyss.''
</P>
<P>
   The pain has produced some gain. The stock price is way up, a
big plus for employees like Schecter, who last February, bought
6,000 shares at about $6 apiece. (Gain as of Monday: $420,000).
</P>
<P>
   Company revenue has turned up sharply in the past two quarters,
so has the backlog, and analysts think Natural Microsystems could
return to profitability as early as the second quarter of this
year.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of risks ahead. Schecter concedes that his
company has to prove it can execute its new plan. Orders from the
telecom giants are ramping up but they will need to climb
considerably for Natural Microsystems to achieve the 60 percent
annual growth Schecter envisions.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, at least, Wall Street is convinced this is one
old dog that has learned a new trick. Good boy.

DENOUNCING NBC'S `GOD' IS CLOSE MINDED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Conservatives are a funny lot, aren't they?
</P>
<P>
   Not ha-ha funny because, let's face it, some conservatives are
as humorous as a root canal. But funny as in odd, as in peculiar,
as in there's just no making some folks happy.
</P>
<P>
   See, you'd think they would be the last folks to condemn a
television show that considers why a just, loving God would allow
evil to persist; how, if we're created in the image of our Maker,
we're occasionally such worthless toadies; and whether this world
we've so misused and abused is worth saving.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think, in a medium infiltrated by witches, mafiosos, and a
liberal president, they would be pleased as punch to have a program
starring God. Yet there they were condemning NBC's new animated
comedy, ``God, the Devil, and Bob,'' even before it debuted last
week. At least nine stations in such holier-than-thou states as
Utah, Mississippi, Idaho, Indiana, and Louisiana refused to air the
show last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Created by Matthew Carlson, a former seminarian, the animated
comedy (Tuesdays, 8:30 p.m., NBC) features the voices of James
Garner as God, Alan Cumming as the Devil, and French Stewart as
Bob, a Detroit autoworker randomly selected to prove that humankind
deserves to be spared from Almighty annihilation. God, who here
looks a lot like Jerry Garcia, loves Lite beer and Pop Tarts, hates
megastores and having His name taken in vain, and will pull a
double rainbow out of His bag of tricks to cheer up his minions.
</P>
<P>
   In its first show, which skewered money-grubbing televangelists
and portrayed Hell as a place where Guy Lombardo endlessly plays
``Auld Lang Syne,'' God encouraged simple acts of kindness, and
better communication and understanding between parents and their
children. Rev. Ellwood Kieser, a Los Angeles priest and a
consultant on the program, called it ``a good show for a family to
watch together and discuss'' because ``it pulls people into a
religious realm, into a God-centered universe.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Other religious groups are raining verbal fire,
including Nihad Award, executive director of the Council on
American-Islamic Relations in Washington, D.C, who denounced the
show as the ``kind of tasteless and trivial portrayal of God that
does a disservice to the millions of American television viewers
who have deeply felt religious beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   The reaction to ``God, the Devil and Bob,'' which drew nearly 15
million viewers last week, isn't that far off from what happened in
1997 when ABC's ``Nothing Sacred,'' premiered. A smart, promising
drama, it featured Kevin Anderson as a young inner-city priest, and
offered a reflection on spirituality and religion in modern times.
But ``Nothing Sacred'' was immediately condemned and dogged by such
groups as the Catholic League until its abrupt cancellation during
its first season.
</P>
<P>
   Such people and groups, self-appointed judges of what's best for
the rest of us, are forever closed to anything offering a
challenging consideration of religion or God, even if such programs
have at their core the most basic and reverent viewpoints. It seems
TV will be forever damned to nothing more complicated than
``Touched by an Angel,'' which has less spiritual maturity than an
episode of ``Davey and Golitah.''
</P>
<P>
   Why is it that programs interested in exploring spirituality in
a contemporary context, and even making it more accessible, are
instantly targeted by conservatives as enemies of organized
religion? They complain that TV is a godless wasteland of bimbos,
himbos, and wrestlers, yet whenever someone tries to present
religious issues, whether in a comedy or drama, they are cast out
like a bunch of Judases. And come to think of it, where was all
this righteous indignation when marriage, an institution some of
these same folks hold so dear they feel the need to legislate its
definition, was mocked when Fox's ``Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire?'' allowed two knucklehead strangers to get
hitched?
</P>
<P>
   Now, is ``God, the Devil and Bob'' a great show? Well, no. But
it's all of a week old, and there's just enough there to hint that
it could get better. If its creators are up to the task, it could
become the sort of smart, thought-provoking comedy with more on its
mind that cheap, easy laughs.
</P>
<P>
   But only if it's allowed to _ and given what happened to
``Nothing Sacred,'' that may be too much to ask. Yet given time,
some people, especially those who criticize such shows without
actually watching them, might find these programs' views of God and
spirituality aren't all that foreign to their own.

DRESS WACKILY AND WIN A CRUISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who wears wacky Bermuda shorts? If you do, you could win a
Boston-to-Bermuda cruise for two aboard the Norwegian Majesty.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,462-guest Majesty _ the only ship offering Bermuda cruises
round trip from Boston _ will return to Boston's Black Falcon
Terminal to begin its season of weekly Bermuda cruises beginning
April 7. So put on your wackiest pair of Bermuda shorts (even if
you have to create them), snap a photo (or use one you already
have), and send it to Mary Ann Campisano, Boston Globe Travel
Advertising Department, PO Box 2378, Boston, MA 02107-2378. Entry
deadline is April 17, and a week or two afterward we'll run a photo
of the winner (oh, the fame of it all).
</P>
<P>
   Here's what that winner will get: one seven-day cruise for two
to Bermuda, including an ocean-view stateroom and complimentary
meals and on-board entertainment. (The cruise must be taken by Oct.
15. The winning package excludes air fare, port charges, tips,
shore excursions, and other personal expenditures. You can't
transfer the cruise or redeem it for cash. The winner must be at
least 18.) The Majesty, by the way, was stretched last year by
being cut in half and having a new midsection added.
</P>
<P>
   So send in those photos. And remember: the wackier the better! &QL; 
 &QL; 
And speaking of the Majesty: Harvey Robbins's All-Star Oldies But
Goodies Cruise takes place aboard the Norwegian Majesty May 21-28.
In addition to a lot of entertainment, a free ``Day of Beauty'' at
the Ashley Paige Day Spa will be given with every cabin booked. For
details and prices, call 978-256-6472. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Travel Trivia: In what direction does the Nile River flow? (Answer
at end of column.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quotable: ``My road leads me seaward to white dipping sails'' _
John Maesfield, British poet, journalist, and playwright. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Travel tales: Many cruise ships give departing guests color-coded
tags to put on their luggage. Thus, on the morning of departure,
there are announcements like, ``All passengers with green tags may
now leave the ship.'' One passenger, we are told, became so
flustered upon receiving his tags that he interrupted a meeting to
tell cruise people that his yellow tag had him scheduled to go to
Amarillo, Texas, and he didn't live anywhere near there! The
employees patiently explained that the tags were bilingual, and
that the Spanish word for ``yellow'' is ``amarillo.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Costly champagne: When Celebrity Cruises' Millennium makes its
maiden voyage in Europe in June, the ship's wine cellar will
proudly display three bottles of 1907 Heisdeck Monopole champagne.
The bottles, salvaged from a Swedish merchant ship in 1998, were
bought by Celebrity at auction for $7,050. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Advice to go: Before a cruise ship arrives in a given port, there
is usually a shore-excursion talk aboard the vessel, and passengers
are always urged to attend. An example of why attending is a good
idea occurred during a British Isles cruise on a Princess ship.
During a talk, which was rebroadcast on stateroom televisions, the
shore excurison manager mentioned several times that Guernsey in
the Channel Islands has its own currency, which cannot be exchanged
for American or English money aboard ship. She thus urged
passengers to ask for their change in English currency. Sure
enough, the day after the ship left the island, a passenger tried
to swap his Guernsey cash aboard ship and was told this could not
be done. ``Why didn't someone tell me?'' he moaned. Well, someone
did. More than once. &QL; 
 &QL; 
A penny saved . . .: A poll shows that 60 percent of truly wealthy
cruisegoers _ those with a net worth of more than $5 million _
choose midpriced lines, not the luxury ships. The rich, however,
are six times as likely to take a cruise. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Did you guess it? Northward. Its flow in that direction is ``one of
the most famous attributes of this most famous of rivers,'' says
Miriam-Webster Inc.

AKAMAI PUTS BOSTON ON THE MAP FOR VENTURE FUNDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ For a glimpse of the shine Akamai Technologies Inc. has
put on the Boston area's high-tech image, look no further than
Technology Square, once a quiet and dingy outpost of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Black Lincoln Town Cars pull up to the square each morning.
Venture capitalists and Web gurus chat on cell phones between
meetings. Saabs and Mercedes, toys of the newly wealthy, fill the
nearby garage.
</P>
<P>
   There are no espresso bars _ yet. This unglamorous spot between
Cambridge's Kendall and Central squares for years boasted only drab
1960s architecture and a greasy cafeteria for employees of MIT and
Polaroid Corp.
</P>
<P>
   But it is home to MIT's vaunted Lab for Computer Science, a
place where the school's best and brightest have batted out big
ideas for 36 years. It's where Akamai was born, and where the hot
Internet traffic-routing company has established its headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Investors say Akamai has changed Boston. In particular, its
initial public offering last fall was the event that put this area
on the map for those underwriting the next generation of Net
development.
</P>
<P>
   Its searing IPO Oct. 29 raised MIT's profile as a hotbed of
new-economy innovation. And its headstart in the realm of boosting
Web speed belied those who
</P>
<P>
   dismissed this region as Silicon Valley's kid brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Akamai is a big deal,'' said Mark Langner, an analyst at J.P.
Morgan Securities in San Francisco. ``Aggressiveness and risk
taking _ Akamai's got all that. That's not always true of East
Coast companies.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Today &LR; , Akamai (pronounced ``Ah-kah-my'') is busy making its
brand a verb. Sites from Yahoo and AOL to marthastewart.com have
``akamaized,'' or signed up for the firm's system of directing Web
traffic more efficiently. Insiders are called ``Akamites,'' and the
``Akamighty'' are a few executives in the top ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai is a kind of Net traffic cop. It routes Web traffic
around the world through 2,000 servers, speeding up content
delivery time by two to 10 times the norm. And it prevents crashes
that can occur when a site is bombarded by an unusual number of
visits.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Benik, an analyst at the Yankee Group, a Boston
telecommunications and Internet research firm, said Akamai's
coming-out created the kind of excitement seldom seen in Boston.
But, he added: ``If we lived in San Francisco, this happens twice a
week there.''
</P>
<P>
   Few could have predicted the phenomenon that would grow out of
some complex math equations cooked up by an MIT professor and a
couple of graduate students. Two years since they were runners-up
in the school's $50,000 Entrepreneurship Competition, their company
is valued at $27.5 billion, and they're sitting on a stock that's
rocketed 1,000 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This tale of a quickly amassed fortune is not lost on the
venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, and investment bankers. If
stodgy New England was seen as sleeping through the
business-to-consumer boom, success stories such as Akamai have
cemented an impression that the region is serious about this year's
B2B Internet rage.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody in the investment world is looking for an Akamai.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Dagres is the general partner at Battery Ventures in
Waltham who stumbled upon Akamai's founders. One of many bounty
hunters who roam MIT's halls, he met Tom Leighton, professor of
applied mathematics, and students Daniel Lewin and Jonathan Seelig,
as they prepared for the $50k contest. They invited Dagres to be
their adviser, he said. He met with them several times and helped
them hone their pitch. By summer, he told them he thought they were
on to something.
</P>
<P>
   But Dagres wasn't in it alone for long. When September arrived,
he found himself in a horse race. Leighton &AMP; Co. had several
high-profile venture firms vying to finance them. Dagres wanted in.
He dug into the plans and numbers and signed on. He accompanied the
crew as they pitched their first customers, Disney and Playboy.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the competition for the first round of financing
came down to four names. The entrepreneurs wanted Battery and a
second firm. That second firm backed out, Dagres said, and ``to
this day, they probably get up in the  &UR; morning  &LR; and have to hide
the sharp things.''
</P>
<P>
   Akamai was the prize beyond any venture financier's wildest
dreams. Most VCs aim to make 10 times their money on an investment.
In the high-flying market of the past year, it's not uncommon to
have seen returns exceeding 100 percent. But Battery turned $8
million into more than $2.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   If ever there were motivation to keep a company on track,
Battery's got it. Those stock profits are only on paper so far. The
first opportunity IPO investors will have to sell their Akamai
shares comes April 26, at the end of the six-month lock-up period.
And analysts say venture firms rarely dump significant holdings all
at once.
</P>
<P>
   How long can Akamai _ Hawaiian for intelligent, clever, and cool
_ ride the crest of the Net infrastructure wave? Perhaps a while,
analysts and venture investors say.
</P>
<P>
   David Readerman, director of Internet strategy at Thomas Weisel
Partners in San Francisco, cites Akamai's ``first mover
advantage.'' By being first to the game and signing on such giant
customers as Lycos, Nasdaq, Time Inc., and Ticketmaster, Akamai is
going to be dominant for now, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the company faces some competition, and some challenges down
the road. One company that has also been aggressive in speeding
Internet delivery has been Inktomi, which recently struck a
strategic alliance with Sandpiper Network. Its technologies are
somewhat different from Akamai's, yet analysts say they all could
be vulnerable at some point as high-speed data delivery becomes
cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   Being a public company has bolstered Akamai's growth. The firm
jumped to 227 customers from 44 in the fourth quarter. Revenue hit
$4 million in 1999, up from ground zero in 1998, and analysts are
looking for $54 million this year. Akamai had 464 employees in
mid-February, from 227 in late September.
</P>
<P>
   There's likely to be stability at the top of the company for at
least a few years, because of ``strong financial incentives'' built
into chief executive George Conrades's pay, a venture capital
executive close to the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Like most start-ups, Akamai is not yet profitable. By the end of
1999, it had accumulated losses of $58.6 million. In a filing with
securities regulators, Akamai said it needs to grow revenues
rapidly in order to reach profitability. Company executives
declined to be interviewed, citing a government-imposed ``quiet
period'' as they complete an acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Investors say they would rather Akamai continue to grow and
expand its capabilities than turn a profit right away.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai already has agreed to buy two firms since going public.
Both deals were aimed at improving the richness of the content the
company can deliver via the Web.
</P>
<P>
   InterVU Inc., a provider of live radio and broadcasting services
over the Net, was snapped up last month for $2.8 billion. In a
January deal, Akamai acquired Network 24 Communications for $200
million, giving it access to the company's fast telecommunications
connections for Web broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai also is investing $5 million in Seattle's Loudeye
Technologies Inc., which improves sound and video sent over the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   Yankee Group's Benik said Akamai's future may depend on its
abilities to integrate new technologies such as these.
</P>
<P>
   He said a long-term threat will be that bandwidth, the
high-speed transmission of data, is getting cheaper. That means
that Akamai's customers may at some point be able to send their
data over the Web just as efficiently without Akamai's delivery
services.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, Akamai has struck alliances with Apple
Computer, Microsoft Corp., and Cisco Systems Inc. All three are
important to Akamai's future, the company says in regulatory
filings, because they involve technology development and large
revenue streams. Last year, Apple accounted for 22 percent of
Akamai's revenue; Yahoo for 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai's shares have enjoyed a stunning ride to a lofty $296
level, fueled by Nasdaq's technology rally. Most Wall Street
analysts who follow Akamai still rate it a ``buy,'' despite the
run-up.
</P>
<P>
   While that's encouraging to investors, there is perhaps no
flattery more honest than that from rivals. Akamai last week was
named company of the year the Massachusetts Telecommunications
Council, a group of 300 companies.
</P>
<P>
   To win, executive director Katherine Raphaelson said, a firm
must have ``managed a changing market, stayed at the leading edge,
and made great strides in innovation.'' She noted: ``Akamai had by
far the most votes.''

OCEAN PRINCESS SPARKLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Slowly and quietly, the Ocean Princess eased out of its docking
space at St. Thomas in the US Virgin Islands. And as the 77,000-ton
vessel moved, all one could hear was Angla singing ``A Time to Say
Goodbye.'' From our balcony 10 decks above the water, I could see
passengers on Celebrity Cruises' Galaxy lined up watching our
ship's movements. No tugs were in sight, as this vessel maneuvered
with its bow and stern thruster.
</P>
<P>
   Soon we had turned around, heading into the sunset as we left
the Virgin Islands, our final stop on a wonderful seven-day cruise
aboard the world's newest cruise ship.
</P>
<P>
   Time slipped by so quickly. It was hard to believe that a
vacation that began on a snowy, blustery day was now winding down
in the warmth of the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   A cruise has a way of taking hold of you, freeing you from the
everyday cares, and comforting you with fine dining, new
friendships, new discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Voyager of the Seas, this ship has no ice skating
rink (I went to the Caribbean to escape snow and ice), no golf
course (it does have a golf simulator), no rock climbing wall (I'd
rather walk on one of the island beaches), and it's not so large
that you feel intimidated.
</P>
<P>
   On a ship like this, it's easy to make friends. On an island
tour my wife and I heard someone say, ``Worcester.'' ``Are you from
Worcester?'' I asked. ``Close by,'' was the answer. Soon we were
joining the couple for before-dinner drinks in an atrium lounge
aboard the ship.
</P>
<P>
   That's one of cruising's assets. You can meet people and get
together again and again in a relaxing atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   While this was the inaugural sailing of the Ocean Princess, it
was like returning home because this ship is the final one in this
class of ships that began with the Sun Princess, some five years
ago. Princess has embarked on a mammoth building program, with four
``grand class'' ships of 110,000 tons plus and two ships of 85,000
tons coming out in the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   When I sailed on the Sun Princess, I thought that the ship
designed to carry 1,900 passengers had a human scale about it _
lots of intimate public spaces. It didn't have the world's largest
casino, or theater, or anything else, just lots of space, lots of
people-friendly space in particular.
</P>
<P>
   Having sailed with Princess before, we were invited to the
Captain's Circle, a gathering of 906 passengers who had previously
cruised with Princess. I like cruising, and while Princess now
sails just about around the world, I also like to try other lines,
sampling their style. So it was amazing at this gathering to see
two people honored _ one for having sailed 42 times with Princess,
and the other for an almost unbelievable 111 cruises.
</P>
<P>
   Cruising can take hold of you. And most lines boast of the
number of repeat passengers. Obviously Princess has found a high
percentage of those who ``return home.''
</P>
<P>
   Making the cruise even more inviting is Princess's high
percentage of staterooms with private balconies. Believe me, it's
worth the extra price to be able to relax or dine on your own
private veranda. Sometimes it's a bit disconcerting, though. In
Martinique, we ordered breakfast on our balcony, only to discover
when we pulled the curtains that the European cruise ship Mistral
was docked not only 50 or so feet away, but the bridge with all the
officers still on duty was directly across from our balcony. We
were eye to eye with the Mistral's captain. But, hey, we were on
vacation. And looking across, I could see Mistral passengers on
their private decks also dressed in robes.
</P>
<P>
   There are 975 staterooms; 603 have outside views. Of these, 408
have balconies. Our minisuite had a bedroom area along with a
separate living room, a bath with a whirlpool spa, a separate
shower, lots of marble, a separate toilet area, two televisions,
two telephones, a walk-in closet, a safe, terry-cloth robes, and a
refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   The Ocean Princess sails on seven-day cruises out of San Juan,
offering a day at sea followed by visits to Trinidad, Barbados,
Antigua, Martinique, and St. Thomas. Trinidad was a new port for
both us and Princess. When the ship is docked along Port of Spain's
waterfront, the island presents a not-too-attractive picture.
Outside the city, though, it's quite nice. We took an island tour,
followed by a visit to a bird sanctuary where we spotted about 15
brilliant red scarlet ibises, the national bird. Others raved about
a rain-forest tour, and while no carts were available for golfing,
it was inexpensive to play and to hire caddies.
</P>
<P>
   On board, the ship offers all the amenities one could ask for.
There are four pools, expansive areas for sunbathing, quiet corners
to curl up on deck and read, a sports deck for basketball, etc.,
within the funnel structure, large children's areas (there were 200
children on board this school vacation week), a large ocean-view
gym, a spa, a fully equipped medical center, a card room, shops,
and a business center with a service for sending and receiving
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   When my wife went off to the library (well stocked and with
deep, comfortable leather chairs), I knew just where it was: the
same location as on the Sun Princess. That's what's nice about
sailing on a similar class ship (others in this class are the Dawn
and Sea Princess): You know where things are, you're at home, and
can relax even more.
</P>
<P>
   In the evening, it was a lively scene. People were out strolling
(there's a nice open promenade deck) and heading to shows forward
and aft _ Princess has two nicely appointed theaters with two
different shows at the same time. Sometimes it's difficult to
decide which to attend. But since there's no admission or cover
charge, it's easy to take in a little of each show. And, besides,
walking between the two theaters after dinner is good for the
system. Although I'm not a gambler, I really liked the casino, not
only for its looks but also for its location, on Deck 8 above the
main traffic flow between lounges and theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Of the many nice lounges on the ship, we liked the Wheelhouse
Bar with its rosewood-paneled walls and nautical feel, as well as
the music, of course.
</P>
<P>
   As anyone who has taken a cruise will tell you, ``You'll never
go hungry.'' On the Ocean Princess you never have to worry about
when to dine _ meals are served 24 hours a day, and the food is
excellent.
</P>
<P>
   The ship has two main dining rooms with two sittings at set
hours. There is a good selection of meals for everyone, from
vegetarians to beef eaters. In addition to the regular menu, steak,
chicken, and fish, along with Caesar salad, are always available.
</P>
<P>
   Horizon Court, on Deck 14 overlooking the ocean, offers food 24
hours a day. It has nice buffet breakfasts and lunches, and in the
evening a bistro menu with table service into the wee hours.
Outside there's a place for hamburgers and hot dogs. And Princess
hasn't forgotten the pizza lovers. Fabio's, at the top of the
atrium, is the place for pizza _ sorry, no takeout, no room
service.
</P>
<P>
   The ship is nicely decorated with a vast collection of art. An
interesting mural behind the passenger service's desk is by Boston
artist Laurie Kaplowitz. The art contrasts dramatically with pieces
put up for almost daily auctions. We were enticed to attend with
promises of possibly winning thousands of dollars in art.
</P>
<P>
   Art auctions have become very popular on ships. But my feeling
is similar to that of buying at duty-free shops in the Caribbean.
Unless you have a good understanding of the products, and are
familiar with pricing at home, avoid them.

HAPPINESS IS A POSITIVE THOUGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA WEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not always easy to be happy. A Japanese proverb describes
the pursuit as ``clutching a shadow or chasing the wind.'' And
Woody Allen in the movie ``Annie Hall'' darkly notes: ``Life can be
divided into the horrible and miserable.''
</P>
<P>
   But, in a departure from decades of research on depression,
psychologists are now actively studying what makes us happy. Dubbed
``positive psychology,'' researchers ask questions such as: Do
happy people tend to share similar attitudes or life circumstances?
Does wealth create happiness? How do we define happiness and how do
we get there?
</P>
<P>
   Martin Seligman, a University of Pennsylvania psychology
professor who is widely regarded as the father of positive
psychology, believes that an optimistic outlook is a key component
to happiness and that it can be learned. Indeed, Seligman is the
author of the popular 1990 book, ``Learned Optimism.''
</P>
<P>
   After 30 years of research on the topic, Seligman asserts that
optimistic people tend to distance themselves from and minimize the
causes of their misfortune, instead taking credit for the good
things that happen to them. Pessimists, on the other hand, blame
themselves for their misfortune and ascribe good events to chance,
he says.
</P>
<P>
   If your boss is brusque with you one day, you could either chalk
it up to the boss's bad day or believe the event occurred because
you're a worthless person.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must not just fix what is wrong in people, but find what is
strong about them,'' said Seligman, who coined the phrase positive
psychology during his 1998 tenure as president of the American
Psychological Association.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers have looked at the role that friendships,
marriage, religious affiliation and money play in achieving
happiness. And new studies are investigating the brain activity of
happy people.
</P>
<P>
   The American Psychological Association dedicated a special
millenium issue of its journal to ``Happiness, Excellence and
Optimal Human Functioning.'' And the psychiatric community is
taking notice as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's catching people's fancy,'' said Dr. George Vaillant,
director of psychiatric research at Brigham and Women's Hospital in
Boston, who published an article last month on the role that
altruism and humor play in a joyful life. ``It's looking at the
positive end of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Positive psychology is also seen as a modern-day solution for
emotional woes that aren't severe enough to require Prozac or years
on an analyst's couch. They say positive psychology is akin to
cognitive therapy, which helps people change their negative thought
patterns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appeals to people. It makes sense,'' said Phil Levendusky,
director of psychology at McLean Hospital in Belmont. ``It doesn't
have you languishing in memories of your early childhood, such as
what happened when your diapers were changed. It's contemporary
problem-solving. It's practical, pragmatic and it works.''
</P>
<P>
   But the profession is far from in agreement on the matter. When
Seligman was asked what he would recommend for a hypothetical
nephew suffering from severe depression, he said he would advise
cognitive therapy _ with no antidepressant medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``(That's) the dark ages,'' said Bessel A. van der Kolk,
professor of psychiatry at the Boston University School of Medicine
and medical director of its trauma center. ``Before
anti-depressants, people would be in the hospital for months.''
</P>
<P>
   Van der Kolk also said positive-psychology enthusiasts go too
far in minimizing the role of past trauma in people's lives, which
often must be talked about freely before a depressed person can get
better.
</P>
<P>
   Even some researchers who study happiness bristle at the broad
definition of positive psychology; Seligman and others include the
study of courage and love in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The label of positive psychology can go very far,'' said
Norbert Schwarz, a psychology professor at the University of
Michigan. ``It becomes warm and fuzzy and hard to understand.''
</P>
<P>
   So, while the academics duke it out about what happiness is and
isn't, and how you achieve it, what do ordinary people have to say
about the matter? Ed Diener of the University of Illinois, in an
article called ``Subjective Well-Being,'' found that happy people
report mild-to-moderate pleasant emotions most of the time, rather
than intense positive moments some of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``One lesson from these findings is that if people seek ecstasy
much of the time, whether it be in a career or in a love
relationship, they are likely to be disappointed,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   And now researchers are getting closer to describing what the
happy brain might look like.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 15 years, Richard Davidson, a professor of
psychology and psychiatry at the University of Wisconsin in
Madison, has conducted studies on brain activity of happy and
depressed people. The left prefrontal cortices of self-described
happy people were bursting with nerve-cell activity while those who
were depressed had more active right prefrontal lobes.
</P>
<P>
   People with active left prefrontal cortices, he said, were found
to be the kind who ``jumped out of bed each day.''
</P>
<P>
   He said measuring brain activity may help clinicians confirm if
a treatment _ say drugs or cognitive therapy _ is working for a
depressed patient.
</P>
<P>
   His work has led some people to wonder if a ``happiness drug''
that stimulates the left prefrontal cortex could be developed.
Meanwhile, Davidson said researchers are looking at whether
external magnetic fields might one day be used to stimulate this
area of the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers are looking at how the typical ups and downs
of a day influence happiness, and how chance events fit it into the
picture.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz of the University of Michigan found that people who came
upon unclaimed dimes at a copy machine (planted by researchers)
reported greater levels of overall satisfaction with their lives
than those who did not find coins. (Their upbeat mood, however,
lasted for only 20 minutes.)
</P>
<P>
   The study had another twist. When researchers asked participants
about their happiness levels _ but first asked them if they'd
discovered dimes at a copy machine and heard them say yes _ the
coins lost their ability to influence mood. It seems chance events
failed to influence mood once the participants were made conscious
of the event.
</P>
<P>
   For Schwarz, the dime study shows just how people's happiness
levels fluctuate throughout the day based on random events. We can
gain more control over our moods, he explained, if we acknowledge
that there are random forces that influence them.
</P>
<P>
   David Myers of Hope College in Holland, Mich., in an article
last month called, ``The Funds, Friends and Faith of Happy
People,'' found that age, gender and income (except that of those
who were very poor; they were unhappy) did not correlate with a
person's sense of happiness.
</P>
<P>
   He found it was more revealing to know about someone's ``traits
and the quality of their work and leisure experiences.'' In
numerous studies over the last two decades, he found people were
most happy when they had spiritual faith of some kind and the
support of a network of close relationships, including marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Myers said these studies confirm the view that depression's grip
on the modern American psyche has much to do with individuals
losing traditional social networks.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, marriage is not always joyful. Myers found that
people who identified themselves in ``not-very-happy marriages''
were less happy than those who were single or divorced.
</P>
<P>
   And now, positive psychology is making its way into the
workplace. Business psychologist Michael Mercer of Barrington,
Ill., said many businesses test optimism using questionnaires
during the interview process. Because people in sales, for
instance, may require an extra dose of ego-protecting optimism to
be effective, employers may offer sales jobs to those highest on
the optimism scale.
</P>
<P>
   Positive psychology has clearly triggered a wide range of
research, and psychologists continue to work to define the field
and its goals. Seligman said he hopes the field keeps its broad
focus, because he believes that positive virtues, such as honesty,
compassion and wisdom, should be studied so society knows how to
encourage these characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   Said Seligman: ``This is not just happy-ology.''

WARMING UP TO BODY TEMPERATURES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Why do body temperatures vary so much among the various
species? Why do reptiles and fish, which also ingest food, have
such low body temperatures? Metabolism governs body temperature,
but why the great differences?
</P>
<P>
   F.H. Chelsea, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Animals all need some warmth to survive. In general, the
warmer they are, the faster the chemical reactions that make them
alive, and the faster they can move and react. For example, an
iguana at 35 degrees Celsius can run three times as fast as one at
20. Iguanas and other lizards, however, are not very good at
generating their own heat and to get warm they have to hope for a
sunny day and find a nice warm rock on which to sit. Mammals
evolved an alternative to the lizards'
``hope-for-a-sunny-day-and-sit-on-a-rock'' strategy: Generate a lot
of heat internally. This keeps the body's reactions going at a good
rate, but needs more careful regulation to avoid overheating, and
things like sweating and panting had to evolve concurrently. Fish
are stuck in a large amount of water at a pretty constant
temperature and they just go with the flow _ tropical fish have
warmer blood, and arctic fish have even developed blood that
contains antifreeze-like substances.

CRUISE SHIPS TRAVEL EVERYWHERE THESE DAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the start of a new century, it's a good time to seek new
horizons in your vacation plans.
</P>
<P>
   Cruising is providing new and far greater opportunities for new
destinations to broaden your horizons.
</P>
<P>
   It is the season to think about Europe, Baltic and Mediterranean
countries, the Pacific, South America, and, a long-time favorite,
Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   With more ships setting sail _ this year ships will debut _
there are added reasons and opportunities for taking a cruise
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   While the Caribbean is still the number one cruise destination
in the world, there's reason to consider distant ports of call.
With a cruise vacation, it is as easy to tour the Mediterranean as
the Caribbean. And, in some cases, there is added value to the
vacation dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Along the Mediterranean lie some of civilization's greatest
moments, greatest monuments to the past. It's a destination many
dream of seeing, but hold off for reasons of time or money.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the Royal Olympic Voyager sets sail on one of the
greatest journeys of discovery. This 25,000-ton ship is heading for
some of the greatest destinations in the world, on three
continents, taking just a week to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, it will only be a taste of what is offered, but what a
taste _ Athens; Turkey for Ephesus (one of the ancient world's
greatest cities, which even in ruins is magnificent); the isle of
Santorini, Greece; Alexandria, Egypt, for Cairo and the pyramids;
Ashdod, Israel, for Jerusalem; Istanbul; and Rhodes and Mykonos in
Greece. It will be a journey of a lifetime in seven relaxing days.
</P>
<P>
   That is a journey that could only be taken on a cruise ship. The
Voyager will be the world's fastest ship. Once on board, passengers
will never have to pack or unpack for each continent, each port of
call. The ship will offer every amenity one could ask for _ there's
even a Turkish bath on board. Adding to the experience will be
on-board, world-class lecturers to bring each destination to life.
</P>
<P>
   The Voyager is just one of the many ships that will be sailing
in Mediterranean waters. Holland America will sail its Rotterdam on
a series of 12-day cruises in the western Mediterranean. Classical
Cruises will offer a sailing ship, the Panorama, on cruises around
the Greek Islands. Costa Cruises' seventh ship, the CostaAtlantica,
will debut in July with a sailing from Venice to ports in Greece
and Turkey. The world's largest sailing vessel, the Royal Clipper,
will be sailing from Cannes, France, to Mediterranean ports.
</P>
<P>
   A sampling of other cruises in Europe this summer:
</P>
<P>
   Abercrombie &AMP; Kent's Explorer will cruise northern Europe.
Celebrity Cruises' new Millennium will depart from Amsterdam on
14-night cruises to St. Petersburg, Russia, and Baltic ports. The
Club Med 2, a tall-masted sailing vessel, will cruise the
Mediterranean, Norwegian fiords, and the Baltic. Costa Cruise Lines
will also offer sailings in the Black Sea aboard the CostaAllegra.
The CostaRiviera will offer seven-day sailings to France, Spain,
Italy, and Tunisia. The CostaRomantic will head for the Norwegian
fiords. Crystal Cruises' Symphony will feature 11- 13-night
itineraries in the Mediterranean, western Europe, and the Baltic
Sea.
</P>
<P>
   First European Cruises' Mistral will offer seven-night sails to
the Greek Isles from Venice; the Azur sails to Greece, Israel,
Egypt, Tunisia, Corsica, and Malta. Holland America's Maasdam will
offer cruises to European capitals and to northern Europe. Linblad
Special Expeditions' Caledonian Star will offer sailings throughout
Europe and into the Arctic waters.
</P>
<P>
   Orient Lines will have its Crown Odyssey in the Mediterranean
and Aegean, and the Marco Polo in the Baltic. Princess Cruises will
have its Crown Princess sailing 10-night Baltic cruises and the
Royal Princess will cruise to London, Iceland, and the Norwegian
fiords while the Grand Princess will offer 12-night cruises between
Barcelona and Istanbul. Radisson Seven Seas Cruises will have its
Radisson Diamond on Riviera and Baltic cruises. The Song of Flower
will ply the Mediterranean and Baltic seas.
</P>
<P>
   Renaissance Cruises will offer 10-night cruises in the
Mediterranean. Royal Caribbean International will have its Legend
of the Seas and Splendour of the Seas in Europe. Seabourn Cruise
Lines will have the Seabourn Sun in the Black, Mediterranean, and
Baltic seas. The Seabourn Goddesses I and II will offer five- to
seven-night cruises in the Mediterranean and Adriatic, while the
Seabourn Legend, Pride, and Spirit will also cruise throughout
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Silversea Cruises will offer 10- 12-night cruises throughout
Europe aboard its Silver Cloud and Silver Wind. Swan Hellenic's
Minerva will offer sailings in Europe, the Mediterranean, and Black
seas. Windstar Cruises will offer seven-day sailings between Nice
and Rome, Lisbon and Barcelona, and the Greek isles.
</P>
<P>
   And Cunard will once again be the only line offering regular
trans-Atlantic service. The Queen Elizabeth 2 will also offer
sailings out of Boston this year. Cunard is offering free air fare
on both the QE2 sailings and the Caronia.
</P>
<P>
   The Caronia, formerly the Vistafjord, recently underwent a $5
million refurbishment. It will sail 12- 14-day European cruises.
Cunard is also offering savings of 25 to 38 percent on Caronia
sailings. With both the air fare and ship savings, bookings,
including a deposit, must be made by March 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carona is a wonderful ship that is unfamiliar to cruise guests
in America,'' said Larry Pimentel, Cunard president. ``She has Old
World charm and a warm, hospitable British style that are
reminiscent of Europe's finest hotels. She's an excellent choice
for travelers who are not attracted to the glitter and glitz of the
newer crop of megaships.''
</P>
<P>
   Alaska will again have a mighty armada sailing its waters. From
big to small vessels, the choice is yours.
</P>
<P>
   Offering a small-boat experience is Alasks's Glacier Bay Tours
and Cruises. The line offers six- and seven-night cruises out of
Juneau. American Safari Cruises has eight-night itineraries between
Juneau and Sitka. Clipper Cruise Line will have its Yorktown
Clipper sailing the Inside Passage. Cruise West will offer
seven-night cruises between Skagway and Seattle and Juneau and
Ketchikan. Its Spirit of Columbia and Spirit of Glacier Bay will
have three-night sailings to Prince William Sound. Spending its
first summer in Alaska will be Radisson Seven Seas Cruises' Seven
Seas Navigator, with seven- to 11- night cruises. Lindblad Special
Expeditions will have its Sea Bird and Sea Lion vessels offering
seven-night sailings between Juneau and Sitka.
</P>
<P>
   Larger cruise ships plan these sailings:
</P>
<P>
   Carnival will have seven-night cruises in Alaska aboard the
Jubilee. Celebrity is sending its Galaxy on seven-night Inside
Passage cruises out of Vancouver, and the Mercury will sail
seven-night cruises between Vancouver and Seward. Chrystal Cruises
will place its Harmony in Alaskan waters for a series of 10-
12-night cruises with embarkation in either San Francisco or
Vancouver. Norwegian Cruise Line's Norwegian Wind will offer
cruises departing from Vancouver, and the Norwegian Sky will do
seven-night cruises from Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the biggest operators of cruises in Alaska are Holland
America and Princess. Both lines also offer extensive land stays
that can be combined with the cruise.
</P>
<P>
   In the Pacific, cruises about the Hawaiian Islands and the
Society Islands from Tahiti are offered
</P>
<P>
   Quark Expeditions will take its polar icebreaker, the Yamal, on
voyages above the Arctic Circle. In China, there are cruises along
the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
   One interesting experience for travelers considering cruising
around distant lands is Royal Caribbean Internation's Royal
Journeys program. The program, offered on sailings of the Legend of
the Seas, explores the world's oceans. During the cruise,
passengers have the option of taking an extended land stay at
various ports, and rejoining the ship a few days later. Passengers
also have the option of arriving early at the port of departure to
explore that area.

<P>
   BENTON LAKE SCHOOL DISTRICT, Mont. _ At the Benton Lake School,
there is only one male student, and only seven in all. Other
children are imported for Christmas plays. And teacher Dawn Dawson
moonlights as the janitor.
</P>
<P>
   But every day, several parents commute 40 miles roundtrip to
give their children a slice of education's newest hot commodity: a
small school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about individual attention,'' says Dawson.
</P>
<P>
   While Montana parents may have a penchant for really small
schools, a similar concept is playing out in Massachusetts as
charter schools and officials shaking up traditional schools strive
to offer students a smaller setting and a more personal touch.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bay State's small school movement _ always loyal to
local control _ is quickly colliding with new state standards that
dictate everything from minutes in a school day to fourth-grade
math tests. How can schools try out better teaching methods if they
have to worry about MCAS? teachers say.
</P>
<P>
   Look at Montana, some national educators say. State standards
are vague and local control is firm. Yet, students consistently
score in the top tier on national academic tests _ despite being in
the 13th poorest state in the nation. Ask almost anyone in Big Sky
country and they say the reason is clear _ the smaller the school,
the better. And less government intervention is even better.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Montana, we like to say what our community is about, our
schools,'' said Larry Stollfuss, school superintendent for Benton
Lake and other rural schools in the 4,000 square-mile Chouteau
County in the central plains of Montana. ``And we don't like anyone
telling us what to do. And we do fine, that's why parents come
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Montana, which can easily fit all six New England states in its
borders, is far from city traffic and overcrowded schools squeezed
for space. There is rarely a line at a restaurant, and a busy town
is one with one traffic light. With less than 1 million residents
and 160,000 public school students, almost every school, even in
big cities, is smaller than the 1,100-student Reading High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how big your school is, parents always want a small
one,'' Stollfuss said.
</P>
<P>
   While Benton Lake's story is extreme, officials say parents from
Helena to Missoula are transferring students to smaller public
school districts, usually in rural districts within driving
distance.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1900s, Montana's rural schools _ each little more
than a teacher's apartment, a classroom, a stage and hardwood
floors sketched with basketball boundary lines _ opened to educate
the children of homesteaders who were spreading across the plains.
</P>
<P>
   Existing even before most towns, there were some 3,000
independent Montana school districts in the 1930s. While a
controversial consolidation movement that continues to this day
lowered that number to around 450, a hodgepodge of tiny districts
still exist. Some sit smack on the edge of city limits; others have
their own elementary school districts, yet feed into one, two or
even three separate high school systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education is a personal matter. And the more it looks like
manufacturing and production, the less likely you are to have an
education,'' said Craig Howley, a Ohio University researcher. He
recently co-published a report showing Montana's small schools in
some cases can override the effect of poverty on student
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a simple lesson, keep schools as small as you can,''
Howley said.
</P>
<P>
   Benton Lake School, next to an underground nuclear missile silo
and with only two homes dotting the horizon, is about as small as
it gets. One classroom. Seven desks, differing only in size. There
are three students in kindergarten and one each in grades 3, 4, 6,
and 7.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at her desk, Dawson, 26, answers a barrage of questions
from other students while trying to teach 5-year-old twins Kristen
and Savannah Huggins to count past 110. She helps Seth Maly with
his multiplication tables, without missing a word of Meagan
Huggins's oral book report on ``Flubber.''
</P>
<P>
   Shayne Maly is one of those parents who makes the long commute
from Great Falls so his two children can go to Benton Lake,
originally built for farm children scattered across the
wheat-brushed landscape. The school is so remote, it's not
officially in a town.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son was getting D's and F's last year in the city, and this
year, he's doing great,'' Maly said. ``The big schools don't give
them as much attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Dawson gets lonely, but rarely scared, in the building that sits
off ``Bootlegger Trail,'' a dirt road used by liquor smugglers
traveling from Canada.
</P>
<P>
   She is governed by a three-member board that meets with her the
first Monday of every month.
</P>
<P>
   There is a fierce determination to keep Benton Lake and other
rural schools running, even though fewer and fewer students are
from the area. Every now and then, the district is threatened to be
swallowed up by Great Falls or Fort Benton, another town about 20
miles away. The school was even closed for a year because of a lack
of students in the early 1990s, but reopened in 1993 with four
students, one being the teacher's son.
</P>
<P>
   ``The school is the town in a way,'' said Stollfuss. ``It's
everything to this area and people don't want to go to Great Falls
or anywhere else. They fight like hell to keep these schools
open.''
</P>
<P>
   Money plays into the equation too. It's often less expensive for
Benton Lake and other rural districts to run their own schools than
become part of a larger district where education taxes may be
higher. Rural school overhead is low _ most buildings are paid for
and new teachers make only around $18,500 a year _ and bureaucracy
is nonexistent. Most taxpayers can get away with paying only a few
hundred dollars for education every year.
</P>
<P>
   Even in districts where funds could be saved by consolidation,
the concept of a small school is held so dear that few want to make
the trade-off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drive from the base every day to bring my three children,''
said Toni Huggins.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Brian, is being transferred to New Mexico next year
and she already envisions anonymous schools and teachers that don't
know her children's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small is always better for children,'' Huggins said. ``I see
it here.''

   The New York Times News Service is planning an expanded weather
package, with a planned starting date of Monday, March 20, which
will be transmitted on Sunday, March 19. The package, consisting of
a weather map as a graphics file and a text file to accompany the
map, is available to graphics clients of the News Service. The new
map grows to 4 columns in width (52 picas), from 3, and is 6 inches
deep; the old was 4 inches deep. This new size permits the
insertion of cloud cover information and the addition of many new
cities.
</P>
<P>
   The map is available both in color and in black and white.
Because the map is much more detailed, we have devised an entirely
new palette of colors to make it easier to read the added
information. A sample of the new map is available at Wieck,
Newscom, Presslink and AP's GraphicsNet.

ULYSSES S. GRANT 
Triumph Over Adversity, 1822-1865 
By Brooks D. Simpson 
Houghton Mifflin, 576 pp., illustrated, $35 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the acknowledgments beginning his new biography, ``Ulysses S.
Grant: Triumph over Adversity, 1822-1865,'' the historian Brooks D.
Simpson nods to the mountain facing him. He thanks William S.
McFeely for his support and the early counsel ``that the best way
for me to say what I wanted to say about Ulysses S. Grant was to
write my own book.''
</P>
<P>
   McFeely's beautifully written 1981 biography of the general won
a Pulitzer Prize and remains a primary reference for insight into
Grant's life and career. And it is only one _ though perhaps the
best _ of numerous books about one of the pivotal figures of
19th-century America.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, there is Grant's autobiography, dictated in the final
months of his life in 1885. An immediate popular success,
``Personal Memoirs'' is an American classic, rich in personal and
political anecdotes and in detailed critiques of military campaigns
and individual battles. Thus, it is hard to conceive that anyone
could make a notable contribution to Grant-related literature at
the outset of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Simpson succeeds with this first volume of a two-part
biography, partly because of the extraordinary events of Grant's
life, partly because of Simpson's talents as a storyteller, and
partly because of his astute decision to focus on the family and
political dynamics that surrounded his subject.
</P>
<P>
   Here, Grant's growth, from his birth as the first child of a
loving if demanding father, and of a quiet, serious mother, to his
acclamation as victor of the Civil War, is a tale of resolute
determination in the face of ceaseless demands. Some innate melding
of kindness, stubbornness, and courage, evidenced early by young
Grant's talent for taming and riding horses, carried him though
financial hardship, bloody battle, and jealous intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, Grant also showed an unusual willingness to
accommodate others _ provided it served his longer-term goals.
Christened Hiram Ulysses (though called ``my Ulysses'' as a boy by
his father), he quickly consented to Ulysses S. Grant after a
clerical error renamed him on his appointment to the US Military
Academy.
</P>
<P>
   West Point itself was not the young man's idea; he ended up
there because his father was looking for a free education for
Ulysses after he refused to go into the family tannery business.
Neither envisioned a military career for the cadet who was willing
to be called Sam Grant.
</P>
<P>
   Sensitive to teasing since boyhood, Grant adopted a quiet
unpretentiousness and graduated, not surprisingly, very near the
middle of his class. After an incident in which he was ridiculed by
a street urchin, he lost any ease in full-dress uniforms, and he
avoided them for the rest of his life. Even after he had become a
four-star general, his appearance belied his achievements, and he
tried to pass unnoticed in camp, on the battlefield, and in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   His reserved nature prompted many adversaries to underestimate
his determination, and many allies _ Abraham Lincoln and William
Tecumseh Sherman among them _ to feel unthreatened by his success.
Numerous instances recounted by Simpson show that Grant's humility
was genuine, none more so than the legendary surrender at
Appomattox, when he quietly greeted a resplendently formal Robert
E. Lee in open tunic, long coat, and muddy boots _ and showed great
sympathy for the conquered Confederate general and his tattered
infantry.
</P>
<P>
   Before reaching that surrender, of course, Grant had survived
many attacks on his character and his abilities, despite regular
battlefield victories and steady progress toward his ultimate goal
of smashing the Confederacy. Although it describes the major
engagements with the enemy, ``Triumph over Adversity'' is not a
dissection of Grant's military tactics. Simpson holds the battle
analysis to a minimum _ don't look here for detailed maps and
second guessing _ and concentrates instead on the relationships
that shaped Grant as a man and leader.
</P>
<P>
   The general's life was full of prickly characters, from his
conniving father and contrarian father-in-law, to his loving but
often distant wife, to a legion of malevolent, ambitious Army
officers and politicians caught up in an unscripted drama of life
and death on a national stage.
</P>
<P>
   Grant's sure grasp of the social and military issues and
personalities slipped but few times once he received his
commission. He had, for example, admirable and steadfast policies
toward blacks as citizens and soldiers almost from the outset of
the conflict, even as the North debated whether the war was about
secession or slavery.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Grant came to regret his General Order No. 11
banning Jews from his command. The order was widely condemned as
anti-Semitic, and his wife referred to it as ``that obnoxious
order.'' On the military side, the brilliant strategist of the
Virginia campaign was the same man who ordered a disastrous frontal
assault at Cold Harbor that left hundreds of dying men trapped
between the lines for days.
</P>
<P>
   This latest biography confirms again the greatness of Grant: His
story is epic in every retelling; his humanity is complex and
fascinating. Simpson's second volume will be welcome if it is as
engaging and stylish as the first.

IN `BANDWIDTH'-MAD MARKET, BILLIONS FLOW IN BET ON SYCAMORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   McDonald's. CBS. Philip Morris. Compaq. Merrill Lynch. Pepsico.
Sycamore Networks of Chelmsford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   That's a list of companies Wall Street thinks are worth $40
billion, give or take a few billion. And no, little 300-employee
Sycamore is not a typographical error.
</P>
<P>
   In an ascent astonishing even by Internet-age standards,
Sycamore went public last Oct. 22 and its share price quintupled at
the end of the first day's trading to give it a $14 billion market
capitalization. Five months later, its stock value has rocketed up
another $27 billion. Within the last two weeks, Sycamore, which
makes optical networking systems for Internet carriers, has
eclipsed Gillette as the state's second-highest valued company,
after data storage giant EMC.
</P>
<P>
   Sycamore is typical of the new breed of Internet companies
valued as much, if not more, for their promise than their
performance. Investors have bid up their stocks in the hopes that
one _ maybe Sycamore, maybe someone else _ could become the next
Cisco Systems or Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine what Sycamore could do for a second act
beyond merely living up to the epic expectations of investors and
surviving what seems like the inevitable shakeout facing richly
valued companies in every Net-related sector.
</P>
<P>
   But what is making Wall Street delirious are industry analysts'
projections that optical networking will become a market worth tens
of billions of dollars annually within three to five years _ with
Sycamore at the heart of it.
</P>
<P>
   The theory seems to be that, in a world where the Internet is
reshaping everything from business to entertainment to human
communication, demand for ``bandwidth'' _ carrying capacity on the
fiber-optic cables that link the world _ will only continue to
explode.
</P>
<P>
   Given the strength and breadth of its technology and the track
record of its founders, whose past start-ups include Cascade
Communications, Sycamore is widely seen as having as good a chance
as rivals, if not considerably better, at dominating this
insatiable market.
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Hannigan, an analyst with Forrester Research, said of
Sycamore: ``It is not ordained that Lucent, Nortel, or Cisco are
going to be dominant in this space. These guys (Sycamore) have a
shot, a good shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Sycamore's business is to provide the gear and management
systems that allow carriers to bring as much traffic as they can
handle to their networks, and to do it more cheaply than the
``legacy systems'' of traditional conduits for data such as AT&AMP;T or
MCI WorldCom.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, ``wave-division multiplexing'' and other
technologies have radically boosted the capacity of existing
fiber-optic cables. One of Sycamore's specialties is systems to
better manage that capacity, somewhat analagous to converting a
private street into a toll road serving thousands of different
vehicles daily.
</P>
<P>
   Sycamore may also be one of the first companies to market with
products supporting ``bandwidth on demand,'' or the capacity for
carriers to offer companies only the data-transfer capacity they
need when they need it.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine what ESPN.com, for example, might pay for the power to
add capacity to support increased traffic to its Web site during
college basketball March Madness, then shut it down the day after
the championship. Or what any other company would pay to get only
the data capacity it needs this minute instead of reserving a ``fat
pipe'' of capacity for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Among investors, much of the enthusiasm for Sycamore can be
traced to respect for its chairman and cofounder, Gururaj ``Desh''
Deshpande, who formed the company in February 1998 with optical
networking whizzes Rick Barry and Eric Swanson from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Lincoln Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Deshpande founded Cascade Communications Inc. of
Westford, a data networking company which in six years grew to $500
million in revenues and 900 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Cascade was bought in June 1997 by Ascend Communications for
$3.7 billion. Ascend, in turn, was bought by Lucent Technologies
for just under $20 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Deshpande ``has the Midas touch here in Massachusetts,'' said US
Representative Edward J. Markey, the senior Democrat on the House's
telecommunications subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Sycamore officials said they were unable to speak for this
article because they are in a ``quiet period'' imposed by the
Securities and Exchange Commission before their planned upcoming
secondary stock offering of up to 17.2 million shares, including
2.6 million that may be sold by insiders and early investors.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Sycamore has scored some big credibility-boosting
contracts that seem to carry far more weight with investors than
its reported $7.4 million loss on revenues of $48.6 million during
the August 1999 to January 2000 period.
</P>
<P>
   Enron Broadband Services, a unit of the Houston-based energy
giant, in January announced a three-year pact with Sycamore worth
up to $200 million. Williams Communications in November said it
would buy $400 million of Sycamore gear over four years. French and
Scandinavian telecom giants are also big buyers.
</P>
<P>
   At a forum at Boston College last week, MCI WorldCom chairman
Bernard Ebbers _ whose company is an investor in Sycamore _
estimated MCI could spend as much as $100 billion over the next
four years adding network capacity to meet bandwidth demand and
will be looking to Sycamore for a big chunk of that.
</P>
<P>
   Also, in January, Sycamore cemented its leadership position by
spearheading the creation of a 100-company consortium developing
open technical standards for optical networking. Such a move has
been compared to phone companies agreeing on a dial tone.
</P>
<P>
   The Interstate 495 belt in Massachusetts is home to a bevy of
optical networking companies that collectively are seen as far
ahead of Silicon Valley, New Jersey, and other optical hotbeds.
Among the many Bay State companies in the sector are Appian
Communications Inc. and Coriolis Inc. of Boxborough, Tenor Networks
Inc. of Acton, and Quantum Bridge Communications Inc. of North
Andover.
</P>
<P>
   The fiber-optic market generally consists of four parts:
long-haul traffic, metropolitan loops, individual connections to
businesses and homes, and switches and other devices that move
traffic among those three segments. Sycamore, unlike many of its
niche competitors, is involved or will be involved in every segment
of the market as well as the software-based systems for running
networks.
</P>
<P>
   Like a gambler buying every ticket in a lottery to ensure he
hits the jackpot, Wall Street collectively seems to be snapping up
every optical networking stock _ including Sycamore, Redback, JDS
Uniphase, Juniper, Ciena, and others _ in faith that at least one
will dominate the market in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   And along the way, whichever one is the ultimate winner may well
use its fabulously appreciated stock to take over several of the
runners-up _ a theory bolstered by Cisco's $7 billion purchase of
Sycamore rival Cerent Corp. last August. Cisco, in fact, may emerge
as one of Sycamore's toughest competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The last five years have seen a revolution in the world's
communications networks in terms of capacity within businesses and
their connections to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   That revolution is now spreading to the core of the Internet, as
carriers begin to upgrade their long-haul pipes to handle the huge
increase in capacity and demand at the enterprise level.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire public network is being rebuilt,'' said Forrester's
Hannigan. ``Sycamore is right in the middle of it, and their value
proposition is a huge increase in capacity and a huge increase in
efficiency.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gwynne, marketing vice president of Quantum Bridge
Communications in North Andover, Mass., a 100-person optical
start-up that focuses on the ``last mile'' connections, said: ``The
whole global telecommunications infrastructure is being replaced
right now with high bandwidth, and Sycamore is the leader in this
space.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwynne, whose company plans to go public sometime next winter
but might be a logical takeover target for Sycamore, said of the
stock price: ``I would invest in it. I know exactly why people are
crazy over it. I'd buy the stock. I'd buy more. It's right on, if
not a little bit low.''
</P>
<P>
   But other voices urge caution.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Wery, the San Francisco executive vice president of the
communications practice at Renaissance Strategy Inc., a global
consulting firm, said while Sycamore is ``the best of breed in that
bucket in a whole industry that is hot . . . there is not enough
room for all these companies to succeed and to achieve the growth
objectives that Wall Street has for them.''
</P>
<P>
   While he would not give numbers specific to different optical
networking companies, Wery said many of the hot optical stocks
assume a 40 or 50 percent growth in revenues every year for the
next five to seven years even before the firms begin amassing
enough profits to justify current valuations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be some true casualties along the way. You will
have only a few winners, and some very bad losers,'' Wery said. But
he added: ``These valuations may be relevant to a few, and Sycamore
may be one of them.''

FISHING INDUSTRY SEES SHARKS RAW DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts fishermen thought they were being smart
when they started selling Cape sharks to the British for fish and
chips in the 1990s, turning New Bedford into America's
shark-fishing capital. Regulators had even urged them to net these
unwanted ``trash fish'' to ease pressure on the beleaguered cod.
</P>
<P>
   But now US Commerce Secretary Richard Daley is considering a
plan that would all but shut down the $8 million fishery amid
mounting evidence that the sharks, better known as spiny dogfish,
are in danger. Once again, say scientists, fishermen have caught
too many, driving another fish species to the brink of collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The management plan has set off a bitter dispute between
conservationists and fishermen, who say they feel double-crossed
after federal officials encouraged the dogfish industry.
Massachusetts' senators and three members of Congress have
temporarily blocked the closure, arguing that more research is
needed to prove the dogfish are as bad off as biologists say.
</P>
<P>
   The federal plan ``basically puts these (dogfish) processors out
of the business and it's going to snuff out a lot of the day
fishermen,'' said Harvey B. Mickelson, attorney for the American
Dogfish Association, which represents three dogfish processing
plants in New Bedford as well as shark fishermen from Massachusetts
to North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   However, conservationists say that fishermen and New England
regulators can blame themselves because they blocked more modest
restrictions in earlier years.
</P>
<P>
   Now, conservationists say that Senators John F. Kerry and Edward
M. Kennedy and congressmen are protecting a local industry at the
shark's expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The short-term economic interests of one state are now
threatening an entire East Coast shark population, as well as the
shark conservation record of the nation,'' said Sonja Fordham,
fisheries project manager at the Center for Marine Conservation in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Dogfish, which seldom grow more than 3 feet long, have none of
the menace associated with sharks, but, like sharks, the females
take a long time to mature _ 12 years _ and then they carry their
fetuses for two years before giving birth. As a result, say
scientists, they have difficulty recovering from heavy fishing
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   But that hardly seemed like a problem in the late 1980s when
dogfish were annoyingly common, often caught in nets that had been
set for cod or other fish. As New England fishing grounds crashed,
state and federal officials alike urged fishermen to find a market
for dogfish and other ``underutilized species,'' sometimes hosting
buffets for consumers to try these delicacies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on dogfish because the National Marine Fisheries Service
said some eight or nine years ago that they are a wonderful
underutilized resource. Go and develop a market,'' said fishermen's
attorney Mickelson.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts fishermen took the advice to heart, accounting for
55 percent of the 49 million pounds of US dogfish landed in 1998.
Three of the four major processing plants are in New Bedford, while
47 to 90 percent of the fish landings in Chatham, Scituate, and
Plymouth were dogfish, virtually all of it bound for Europe and
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   However, scientists say that 10 years of unrestricted fishing
for dogfish has had a devastating effect, mainly because the
females are larger and fetch the highest price in the market. The
quantity of sexually mature females has dropped by more than 80
percent since 1990, imperiling the next generation of fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't sustain a fishery very long if you target the
pregnant females,'' said John Musick, head of the vertebrate
ecology program at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science and an
authority on dogfish.
</P>
<P>
   But Fordham said efforts to regulate the dogfish catch over the
past five years have run into resistance from fishermen and the New
England Fishery Management Council, which jointly regulates Cape
shark fishing along with the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management
Council.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, last January, Secretary Daley approved a plan from the
two councils that set such low limits on the dogfish catch that it
would end direct fishing for the shark on May 1. The plan then sets
tight fishing limits for rebuilding the dogfish population over the
next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Senators Kennedy and Kerry, along with US
Representatives William Delahunt, Barney Frank, and James McGovern,
intervened, asking Daley to delay action on the plan until
mid-March.
</P>
<P>
   The members of Congress argued that, despite the supposed
crisis, dogfish are still enormously abundant, accounting for 40
percent of fish caught by federal scientists last summer. They also
pointed out that the New England Fishery Management Council
reversed its support for the plan after initially submitting it.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Daley, the members of Congress agreed on the need
for ``a very substantial reduction in the dogfish catch,'' but the
current plan will have a ``very severe impact . . . on one of the
few remaining . . . viable fisheries in New Bedford.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, with Daley's dogfish decision imminent,
representatives of the two regional fishing councils are scheduled
to meet in Annapolis, Md., to disuss a new conservation plan for
him to consider, with the New Englanders pushing for less
restrictive fishing limits.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't impress Fordham of the Center for Marine
Conservation. ``We are going to create a collapse that is going to
take decades to repair. That's just a huge shame, and a waste of
public resources,'' she said.

INTEL, AMD GET NOSE TO NOSE AND LET THE CHIPS FLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; SUNNYVALE, Calif. _ There's nothing Silicon Valley loves more
than a good old-fashioned chip war.
</P>
<P>
   And riveting the Valley today is a dogfight between the
industry's two biggest players _ Intel Corp., the $30 billion
chipmaker, and its much smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc.,
or AMD.
</P>
<P>
   Competition is nothing new to the Valley, where companies are
admonished to either eat someone's lunch or be someone's lunch.
What makes this contest interesting is the sheer audacity of AMD in
taking on Intel, one of the fiercest competitors in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, AMD, which hasn't had a profitable year since 1995,
seems to be scoring big. Last week, AMD made headlines by beating
Intel in introducing an ultrafast one-gigahertz chip.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a yappy little dog making a run at a pit bull,''
said Keith Diefendorff, editor in chief of the Microprocessor
Report, an industry newsletter. ``It's amazing that they've even
come close and have even beaten Intel. It's quite astonishing,
really.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's the story in a nutshell: While both companies were
founded in the late 1960s at the dawn of Silicon Valley, Intel has
since buried its rivals with better talent, better designs, and
legendary drive, becoming the undisputed king-of-the-hill and
owning more than 80 percent of the $24 billion PC chip market.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, AMD has struggled to remain alive by focusing on less
expensive chips. In the mid-1990s, AMD's scrappy chief executive
and founder, Jerry Sanders, decided to bet his company on a new
chip design that he hoped would let AMD compete head to head with
Intel. The gamble was huge, involving expenditures in the billions
of dollars to develop the chips and build state-of-the-art
factories.
</P>
<P>
   ``They bet their entire company on this,'' said Diefendorff.
</P>
<P>
   What resulted was the Athlon line of chips, which began shipping
in June. For the first time, AMD had a viable answer to Intel's
high-end microprocessors, which are the brains in computers. ``We
had never before been in the high-performance space before the
Athlon,'' said Stephen A. Lapinski, AMD's director of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   AMD began to see its market share creep up, particularly at the
high end of the market. In January 1999, Intel commanded 97 percent
of the sales in the United States for chips used in personal
computers that sold for $1,500 to $2,000, while AMD had 3 percent,
according to Stephen Baker, director of hardware analysis at PC
Data in Reston, Va. By January 2000, Intel's share was down to 53.5
percent, while AMD claimed 46.5 percent, Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   And last week, AMD was able to pull off its greatest coup by
introducing the fastest chip on the market _ the one-gigahertz
Athlon processor _ two days before Intel.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something nobody has been able to challenge Intel on,''
said Baker. ``It's a great marketing coup.''
</P>
<P>
   But a marketing victory may be the only meaningful prize AMD
will get for its troubles, some analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``AMD won the race but only by the narrowest of margins,''
Diefendorff said. ``It's so narrow that in the big scheme of
things, it's not going to be very significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Diefendorff points to weaknesses in the Athlon chip that slow
down its overall performance. The biggest problem, perhaps, is that
the chip's cache, or internal memory, sits slightly apart from the
processor, forcing information to travel to the processor and
slowing down the chip by slivers of a second. Intel's cache sits on
the processor itself, saving time.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we put our processor on a racetrack, it will have higher
performance in total,'' said Ralph Bond, an Intel spokesman, of the
Intel Pentium gigahertz compared to the Athlon gigahertz. ``We
wound up with the fastest processor in the world, but we didn't
have the fastest news release in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, AMD has reason to crow. Just as Bill Bradley forced Vice
President Al Gore to fine-tune his campaign, AMD has made Intel
more fleetfooted. The result: Consumers have benefited because
products such as the gigahertz chip have come out months ahead of
schedule and prices have come down faster than if Intel were
unopposed, analysts say. Aside from that, the rivalry has made for
good theater in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Said Diefendorff: ``You can't deny AMD's got guts.''

A HUMAN RESOURCE FOR SURFING THE NET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; One of the next contestants in the dot-com derby will feature
an ``intelligent agent'' for searching the Internet, combined with
state-of-the-art speech-recognition technology especially useful in
wireless Net access.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically: An actual human being who talks to you on the
phone.
</P>
<P>
   Five-month-old Quixi.com, a New York-based start-up going live
across the country in about 10 weeks, is cofounded by Newton, Mass.
native Robert Pines. It aims to cut through Internet hype and
technology overload by offering, for $20 a month, all the calls you
want to speed-dial to a personal assistant who will do your Net
surfing for you and also complete calls and e-mails for you.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all the hoopla over using your wireless phone to get onto
the Net, Quixi promises what many may find to be a satisfying
technological leap backward: Use the phone to call someone to go on
the Net and find or buy what you are looking for, rather than drive
off the road or walk into a mailbox while you try to scroll down a
tiny screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It truly lets you do e-commerce wherever you are,'' said
Pines, a 1986 Harvard graduate whose mother is former state Senator
Lois G. Pines.
</P>
<P>
   Pines likes to call Quixi the country's first ``personal
bandwidth'' company. ``We're definitely going against the trend on
the technology side, but we think the human being is the best
interface,'' said Pines. ``Other technologies don't necessarily
save you time. We get things done for you by providing a real
person to do the work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a lot to do _ offload some of it on us'' is a line
Pines and cofounder Evan Marwell, also a Harvard grad, use to
explain the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, for $19.95 a month, Quixi subscribers will get
unlimited access to three services: Find, Shop, and Connect. Find
and Shop are ways to get access to people who will search the Net
for information you need _ the closest steakhouse to your Houston
hotel, for example _ and buy the flowers you should have bought
your spouse for your anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Quixi Connect is like a flesh-and-blood version of Wildfire, the
phone-and-messaging virtual ``assistant'' offered by Wildfire
Communications of Lexington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   By giving Quixi your Rolodex, you can call in and say, please
connect me to Alice and Lisa, or send this e-mail to John. Pines
envisions Quixi being especially popular for people driving home at
night or for some of the 5 million US personal digital assistant
owners who may be running through an airport and can't flip open
the machine.
</P>
<P>
   The great and perhaps unanswerable question until it hits the
market is how many people are willing to pay $240 a year to have an
Internet serf at their beck and call, plus an old-fashioned ``Get
me Watson on the phone'' secretary to whom you hand over your
entire address book.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, many new-economy Americans say they would prefer
having more time than more money.
</P>
<P>
   If you've ever used one of the new Internet-enabled wireless
phones to try to order a book from Amazon.com, for example, or get
directions to the Airport Sheraton in an unfamiliar city, you may
find it easy to imagine you could get the job done much faster by
using the phone like a phone and calling someone to do it _
especially using the keypad to write and send an e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Quixi sees as one big customer base the 15 million of the 85
million US cell phone owners who use them more than 200 minutes a
week. But there is no reason you couldn't use it from any phone to
make exploiting the Net quicker and easier. Forrester Research has
estimated that nearly 40 percent of Net shoppers quit before
completing transactions they want to do because of the hassle.
</P>
<P>
   Pines has already made a fortune by founding a company called
InfonXX in Bethlehem, Pa. that provides directory assistance to
wireless telephone companies including Bell Atlantic Mobile,
AirTouch, AllTel, and some Cellular One franchises. To support
Quixi, an elite corps among the 2,000 InfonXX operators will be
trained as Internet Sherpas.
</P>
<P>
   Marwell and Pines already know a few things about the economics
of running a call center, where the 10 percent of pain-in-the-neck
customers may account for 50 percent of costs.
</P>
<P>
   Some big-name investors, including Flatiron Partners and
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, have shoveled $27.5 million into the
company. Much of the venture funding will go into a buzz-promoting
billboard campaign in New York and Los Angeles this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just say we think we can make this work,'' Pines said.

THE GOOD TIMES ROLL IN LOUISIANA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By Harry Shattuck 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Most folks would face a serious challenge in following
up the biggest yearlong party of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Not our neighbors to the east.
</P>
<P>
   Every day has cause for jubilation in Louisiana. So what do
residents do as an encore to the hundreds of special events that
comprised FrancoFete '99, commemorating the tricentennial of the
state's first permanent settlement?
</P>
<P>
   They simply strike up the band. And we're all invited to listen.
</P>
<P>
   Or, better yet, participate.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
FOCUSED ON THE MUSIC &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis this year, from Monroe to Houma, is on the rich
musical heritage of a state that has produced Louis ``Satchmo''
Armstrong and Britney Spears, Mahalia Jackson and Tim McGraw, Fats
Domino and Harry Connick Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Among other claims to fame (and keep in mind that Louisianans
aren't shy about making claims):
</P>
<P>
   _ The nation's first opera was performed in New Orleans in 1796;
</P>
<P>
   _ The name ``jazz'' was first given to the music of New Orleans
about a century ago;
</P>
<P>
   _ Guitarist Huddie ``Leadbelly'' Ledbetter became renowned as a
``father of the blues,'' singing his way out of prisons (in
Louisiana and Texas) during the early 20th century;
</P>
<P>
   _ Elvis Presley got his start at the Louisiana Hayride in
Shreveport in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrations this year include the Festival International de
Louisiane (April 26-30) in Lafayette; the New Orleans Jazz and
Heritage Festival (April 28-30 and May 4-7) in New Orleans; the
Cajun Fun Fest (May 4-7) in New Iberia; the Red River Revel (Sept.
30-Oct. 7) in Shreveport; and September zydeco festivals in
Opelousas, Lake Charles and St. Martinville.
</P>
<P>
   Or you could check out the Great Southern RV Park Bluegrass
Festival (April 20-22) in Angie; Mudbug Madness (May 25-28) in
Bossier City; or the Southern Pickin' and Ginnin' Festival (Sept.
16) in Rayville.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than 600 fairs and festivals are devoted all or in part
to Louisiana music,'' says Dwight Landreneau, assistant secretary
for the Louisiana Department of Culture, Recreation and Tourism's
Office of State Parks.
</P>
<P>
   The parks system is heavily involved, too. ``All of our sites
offer an historical interpretation of music,'' Landreneau says.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel State Historic Site, situated near Marthaville (about a
half-hour drive from Natchitoches) and home to the Louisiana
Country Music Museum, will host the Louisiana Fiddlers'
Championship on April 1.
</P>
<P>
   Plans are being formulated to stage an opera at
Longfellow-Evangeline State Historic Site in St. Martinville.
Eighteen miles to the southeast, Lake Fausse Pointe State Park is a
popular venue for Cajun bands.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CAJUN INFLUENCE WORLDWIDE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'm itching to mosey over to Eunice, near Lafayette, where an
informal get-together occurs every Saturday at the Savoy Music
Center, headquarters for master accordion maker (and player) Marc
Savoy and his wife, Ann, an accomplished guitarist.
</P>
<P>
   There, locals and visitors _ 40-50 people on an average
Saturday, as many as 200 on some occasions _ gather from 10 a.m.
until noon for an all-acoustic jam session, pausing only long
enough to enjoy free coffee and boudin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody plays together, and our only rule is that the oldest
person in attendance gets to decide what to play,'' Marc Savoy
says. ``I don't know if the heat is responsible, or maybe the
peppers we use to spice our food, but the music is always
energetic.''
</P>
<P>
   On one Saturday, Savoy says, ``We had 17 fiddlers show up.
Another time, a large contingent of Japanese tourists stopped by,
and they brought horns and instruments I've never seen before. They
sat in with us and played Cajun music.''
</P>
<P>
   Their influence was long-reaching. ``We've sold several
accordions to Japanese citizens,'' Savoy says. ``Cajun music is big
in Japan. I know of three Japanese Cajun bands, including the
Yokohama City Aces.''
</P>
<P>
   For regulars, the Savoy stop often is the second on a day-long
agenda that begins with a traditional Cajun breakfast (``Boudin and
beer,'' says Landreneau, laughing.) and musical accompaniment at
Fred's Lounge in nearby Mamou.
</P>
<P>
   There is no telling where an afternoon session will break out.
``The great thing about our part of Louisiana is that musicians are
very accessible,'' Savoy says. ``If you go to a person's house,
knock on the door and say, `I'd like to have a jam session on your
back porch,' chances are it'll happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning at 6 p.m. on Saturdays, Eunice's famed Liberty Theater
is the setting for more music _ and a celebration of the area's
French language and heritage _ on the ``Rendezvous des Cajuns''
live radio broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The music you hear is in its purest form, carried down from
Marc and Ann's ancestors,'' Landreneau says. ``But one great thing
about our state is that the music changes in each area.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the echoes of Cajun and zydeco; jazz and bluegrass; R&AMP;B,
gospel and opera, be certain of this, too: Louisianans already are
planning well into the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just leading up to 2003 and the 200-year anniversary of
the Louisiana Purchase,'' Landreneau says. ``That'll be our biggest
celebration yet.''

Communist Party, who disagree with Putin's views on relations with

   RUSSIA'S ELECTIONS: Despite the hype surrounding Vladimir Putin,
almost 50 percent of Russians are expected to vote for other
candidates in the upcoming presidential elections. Twelve
candidates are running in the race, and some of the strongest
opposition to Putin comes from rank-and-file members of the
Communist Party, who disagree with Putin's views on relations with
the United States and on economic issues such as land reform. In a
Communist bulwark town, regular Russians give their views about
politics and why they stand behind their man, candidate Gennady
Zyuganov.

 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A federal judged ruled that death row inmate
Darrell Rich could not participate in an American Indian spiritual
ceremony to purify his soul before his scheduled execution early
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker issued his ruling Monday,
agreeing with arguments made by the state that guards could not
maintain adequate security during the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Foster, one of Rich's spiritual advisers, said, ``This
is an issue of denial of religious freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Rich, 45, was convicted of killing three women and a girl and
attacking five other women during a two-month rampage ending in
August 1978. His final crime was to throw 11-year-old Annette Selix
from a 105-foot bridge, killing her.
</P>
<P>
   Rich's execution was scheduled at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After he was imprisoned, Rich discovered that his biological
father was part Cherokee. He adopted American Indian religious
rituals and now refers to himself as Darrell Edward Young Elk.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Gov. Gray Davis denied clemency for the convicted
rapist-murderer.

   NY-HUNTS-POINT (New York) _ The Hunts Point Terminal Market, the
giant wholesale produce market in the South Bronx, is the
waystation for the bulk of the fresh vegetables and fruits offered
in the city's restaurants and greengrocers _ the palest endive,
wrapped in tissue, the most tender baby artichokes and clusters of
moist green peanuts, still perfumed with the rich earth they left
in the Everglades the night before. And it is not just the domain
of professional buyers. Although the public is officially
discouraged from shopping there, persistent souls are tolerated if
they come prepared, and the thrill of a bargain there is enhanced
by the awe of being at a crossroads of world commerce, like Times
Square or the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. By Matt Lee and

   NY-RESTAURANTS-SMOKE (New York) _ For New Yorkers, smoking in

Anti-smoking advocates, content to have won the war over the dining

may be consuming first or second-hand smoke, a newly hardened
resistance is digging in. Social and serial smokers are puffing
away at an underground network of restaurants that would rather
risk an inspection than alienate valued customers. By Rick Marin.

   GRANBURY, Texas _ For many here, there's no doubt that the famed
outlaw Jesse James is buried in Granbury Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Even if history books say he died at the hands of Bob Ford on
April 3, 1882, in St. Joseph, Mo., they see the exhumation _ and
DNA testing _ as clinching proof that the accounts from their
childhood are true.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly don't think it's even a possibility that it's not
him because I've talked to the grandsons,'' said Mary Kate Durham,
75, an authority on local history, referring to three retirees who
live in Oklahoma, Arkansas and Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't agree with the tests, the grandsons might dig
him up and bury him somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Hood County Judge Linda Steen signed an exhumation
order, removing the last hurdle to exhuming a body buried here in
1951. The remains are those of J. Frank Dalton, who told Granbury
residents that he was James. If so, he would have been 104 when he
died.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family's position to me is they want to know who they are
and they have a right to that,'' said Steen, who counts herself
among those convinced that the real Jesse James is buried in
Granbury.
</P>
<P>
   Steen's predecessor, Don Cleveland, did not grant a similar
request in 1996, saying that the family did not provide a
compelling reason for an exhumation.
</P>
<P>
   The county judge's order comes despite DNA testing of remains
exhumed in 1995 from what historians and relatives have identified
as Jesse James' grave in Kearney, Mo. Experts said that results are
consistent with what is known of the 19th-century outlaw.
</P>
<P>
   Bud Hardcastle, an Oklahoma used-car salesman who represents the
purported grandsons, contends that the tests, by George Washington
University forensic scientist James Starrs, were inconclusive.
Moreover, he said, a tooth found in a museum, rather than one taken
from the grave, was used to determine the DNA match.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes as planned, the Granbury grave will be opened within
30 to 60 days, Hardcastle said.
</P>
<P>
   He asserts that James faked his death to elude authorities and
moved to Texas under the assumed name of Dalton. When Dalton died
in 1951, a ``visual'' autopsy by the Hood County sheriff listed at
least 16 bullet wounds, rope burns on a 17 1/2-inch neck, scarred
and burned feet, and the tip of the left index finger ``sawed
off.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Hood County seat, possessing the remains of the notorious
outlaw is a source of pride to some and a source of bemusement to
others.
</P>
<P>
   Jeannine Macon, owner of the Brazos River Trading Co., said
she's curious to see the results of DNA tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to find out if these stories are true,'' Macon said.
</P>
<P>
   Macon, who moved from Dallas 28 years ago, said it's possible
that James died in Granbury but concedes that there may have been
some embellishment along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people like a story. They enjoy folklore and take it
with a grain of salt,'' Macon said. ``Texans are famous for telling
tall tales.''
</P>
<P>
   Jesse James is not the only infamous character who locals insist
had passed time in Granbury.
</P>
<P>
   John St. Helen, an unsuccessful Granbury saloon keeper, claimed
when he was close to death that he was really John Wilkes Booth,
the assassin of President Lincoln. St. Helen recovered and fled
Hood County, eventually dying in Oklahoma. A court denied a 1995
request to exhume remains from Booth's grave in Baltimore for DNA
testing.
</P>
<P>
   According to local legend, bandit queen Belle Starr maintained a
hideaway in northwest Hood County where she trafficked in horses
that she repeatedly sold and stole. Not far away in Hico, William
``Billy the Kid'' Bonney is supposedly buried under the alias
Brushy Bill Roberts _ not at Fort Sumner, N.M., as history holds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Elvis sightings _ everybody loves a mystery,'' said
Carolyn Brennecka of the Jesse James Farm and Museum, which is on
the James farm six miles outside Kearney, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man in Granbury has probably been the most famous
imposter,'' Brennecka said. ``Whatever way this comes out, there
will probably be more claims surfacing later. But what we know is
this is the birthplace of Jesse James. Whatever tests they come up
with, they can't take that away.''

JUDGE RULES SCHOOL VOUCHERS VIOLATE FLORIDA'S CONSTITUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Florida judge ruled Tuesday that the use of taxpayer money for
private school tuition is a violation of the state constitution.
The ruling curtails the nation's boldest experiment in using market
pressure to improve failing schools.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, which the state said it would appeal, was the
second major legal setback for voucher proponents in recent months,
following a federal judge's ruling that Cleveland's voucher program
contravenes the First Amendment's separation of church and state,
</P>
<P>
   Florida's was the first statewide voucher program and the first
to tie voucher eligibility to schools' performance on standardized
tests. It serves as a model for a national voucher plan proposed by
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumptive Republican
presidential nominee, and has been copied by several of the 25
state legislatures currently considering new voucher initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ruling puts a stake in the heart of the voucher
movement,'' said Bob Chase, president of the National Education
Association, the teachers' union whose Florida affiliate was
involved with the lawsuit challenging vouchers. It sends a strong
signal to states across the nation that vouchers are no substitute
for a quality public education.''
</P>
<P>
   The 53 children in Pensacola, Fla., who are currently using
vouchers to attend private schools will be allowed to finish out
the semester, but the state will not pay their tuition next year.
The ruling also stops the program from expanding to as many as
60,000 students in 78 schools who would have become eligible for
vouchers in June if their schools were graded ``F'' for the second
time in four years.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tragedy because this beacon of hope that has been
offered to parents as a way for their children to get a better
education has, at least temporarily, been snuffed out,'' said John
F. Kirtley, a Tampa venture capitalist who is on the board of
Floridians for School Choice, a pro-voucher group.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The ruling by Judge L. Ralph Smith Jr. of the Circuit Court of
Florida focuses on a provision of the Florida state constitution
that declares education a ``fundamental value'' of the state and
says it is a ``paramount duty'' to provide a ``uniform, efficient,
safe, secure and high quality system of free public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Voucher proponents had argued that since the state already
spends millions of dollars a year sending disabled and other
students with special needs to private schools, it could also do so
to help students escape low-performing schools. But Smith said that
since in the voucher program, private schools would be providing
the same services available in the public ones, it ``supplants the
system of free public schools mandated by the constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   While the ruling may be a catastrophic blow to Florida's
program, its impact nationally is limited because it turns on a
narrow provision of the state constitution, rather than the broader
question of whether vouchers, which are typically used at parochial
schools, violate the federal Constitution's separation of church
and state. A federal judge in Cleveland declared in December that
that city's voucher program is illegal on those grounds, a decision
that has been appealed and is expected to soon land before the U.S.
Supreme Court.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``This is a blip in the voucher movement,'' said Clint Bolick, a
lawyer for the Washington-based Institute for Justice, a
conservative group that helped defend the lawsuit. ``There has not
been a single lawsuit yet where we have not had at least a
momentary setback. We have developed some serious stamina. At the
end of the day we have not lost a single voucher program.''

FOR A WINERY, VALUE IS ALL IN THE FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Dining)  
 (af)  
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When he graduated from Holy Cross College in 1973, Mike Benziger
could have gone home to White Plains and built a nice life for
himself. He could have joined Park-Benziger, the wine importing
house founded in New York by his grandfather Joe 40 years earlier
and run by his father, Bruno.
</P>
<P>
   But no. He chose to go to California for postgraduate work in
skiing and surfing. To fill in the time between the slopes and the
Pacific, he worked in a wine shop, using the knowledge he had
acquired from the family business. He promptly fell in love with
California wine.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few years, he had lured his entire family west to share
his enthusiasm, including his parents and his six brothers and
sisters. Together, they founded the Glen Ellen Winery in 1981 on an
85-acre parcel of vineyard land just north of the town of Sonoma,
an hour's drive north of San Francisco. It turned out to be one of
the more successful gambles of the last two decades in the
California wine boom.
</P>
<P>
   Tasting, and drinking, about a dozen of the latest Benziger
releases recently, I was reminded of how innovative the Benzigers
have been. Starting with a handful of premium wines made from their
own grapes, they saw an opportunity that no one else in the
business had discerned when a huge surplus of good but inexpensive
varietal wines came on the market in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Glen Ellen and M.J. Vallejo labels, they produced
large quantities of varietal wines _ wines made from specific grape
varieties _ selling in the $4 to $5 range. By the late 1980s, Glen
Ellen, with a wine category that became known as ``fighting
varietals,'' which aggressively challenged the tradition of
expensive varietal wines, was the largest winery in Sonoma County,
with annual revenues of $135 million.
</P>
<P>
   But this was not what the Benzigers had come west to achieve.
And with a production of 4 million cases a year, they were also
getting into the ring with heavyweights like E.&AMP;J. Gallo, and to
stay in the high-volume low-cost game, they would have needed huge
infusions of capital.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, they sold the Glen Ellen business to Heublein for $80
million, changed the winery name to the Benziger Family Winery and
downsized the business to today's 180,000 cases. Now they were
going for quality rather than quantity.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when wine prices are appallingly high, the Benzigers
have managed to keep theirs within reason. Their wines represent
good value. I recently tried several 1997s, including a Sonoma
County merlot at $17 and a Sonoma cabernet sauvignon, $17. Both are
fruity, well-structured wines that match competitors costing at
least $10 more a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   I particularly liked a 1997 California pinot noir, $21, and also
tasted a 1998 Carneros Chardonnay, $13, and a 1997 Sonoma County
zinfandel, $21.
</P>
<P>
   In addition I tasted several wines of less-known varieties
produced in small quantities and available only at the winery,
including a white Burgundy, which I liked; a sangiovese; and a
petite sirah from the ``Imagery Collection.'' There is also a small
line of reserve wines and an even smaller group of single-vineyard
wines: three cabernet sauvignons and a chardonnay from California
and, from Oregon, a pinot noir and a pinot gris, none of which I
have tried yet.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to these small-batch wines, the standard Benziger
wines usually include grapes from many vineyards. The 1997 Sonoma
cabernet sauvignon, for example, includes 33 lots of grapes from 18
ranches.
</P>
<P>
   In California, grape growers call their farms ranches. A single
ranch may include several well-known vineyards. Each year, Benziger
buys 300 lots of grapes from more than 60 California ranches, from
Paso Robles in the south-central coastal region to Mendocino in the
north. This is in addition to the grapes grown in the 85-acre
Sonoma Mountain Estate home vineyard and its 65-acre Willamette
Valley Vineyards in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   With much fanfare, the family opened a small brewery in 1997 on
the Sonoma estate to produce 100,000 cases of premium beer for the
Sonoma Valley and San Francisco. It closed after a year. Mike
Benziger, the winery president, said, ``We opened for business just
as the microbrewery fad was peaking.''
</P>
<P>
   The brewery is being converted into a second winery that the
Benzigers say will allow them to increase production to 500,000
cases a year. It is set to open next month.
</P>
<P>
   The Benzigers are proud of their reasonable prices but are not
opposed to raising some of them. The top cabernet sauvignon sells
for around $45. ``I'd like that to go up,'' Mike Benziger said,
``and I'd like our vineyard-designated wines to range between $35
and $70 a bottle. But we've got to earn that.''
</P>
<P>
   As family wineries go, not even the Gallos can claim as large an
active clan. Only the Fetzers, who once had 10 children involved in
running their vineyards, can match the Benzigers.
</P>
<P>
   Of the other Benziger brothers, Bob handles business
development, Joe and Jerry are winemakers. Of the sisters, Patsy
manages a winery apprentice system, Chris is Midwest regional sales
manager and Kathy is Eastern sales manager. Patsy's husband, Tim
Wallace, is chief executive officer. Helen Benziger, mother of the
seven, manages VIP services. Bruno Benziger died in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   With husbands, wives and children, there are, Mike Benziger
said, ``more than two dozen Benzigers living in the Sonoma Valley
and involved in one way or another with the winery. Our strategy is
to stay family and stay small.'' With all those Benzigers making
and selling wine, that isn't going to be easy. &QL;

MUST RIESLING GROW DRIER?

   (Dining)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Though wine writers often extol the glory of fine
German rieslings, the American public has responded with a great
collective yawn. Many reasons are cited: the German labels are too
complex, the descriptive terminology is incomprehensible, the wines
are too sweet.
</P>
<P>
   The Rheingau region in southwest Germany has moved toward making
drier wines more in step with what the public is perceived to be
demanding. Count me among the riesling lovers, but I do not prefer
the drier style.
</P>
<P>
   The dry German rieslings I've tasted tend to be austere and
tight. But retain the sweetness, along with the lush flavors of the
grape and enough acidity to offset the sugar, and you have a wine
that transcends terms like dry and sweet. A better description for
the best German wines would be ``balanced.''
</P>
<P>
   German wines are rated by the sugar content of the grapes. Those
with a normal amount of sugar are called kabinett. Those that are
allowed to ripen further, and thus have more sugar, are known as
spatlese.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, kabinett wines have a slight amount of sweetness and
spatlese wines more, but that's not always so. Spatlese grapes are
sometimes fermented until the sugar is transformed into alcohol,
resulting in a spatlese that is dry and powerful rather than light
and sweet.
</P>
<P>
   The American fear of sweet wines, I think, comes from drinking
bad ones, like the syrupy stuff that stuck to the Passover table.
But tastes change. A century ago, rieslings from the Rheingau were
considered among the world's most glorious wines.
</P>
<P>
   When I was growing up, if people gave any thought to German wine
at all, it was to concoctions like liebfraumilch. Maybe tastes will
change again.

IT'S A SHAME THAT SO FEW GO TO SCHOOL OPEN HOUSES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA FRAZIER ANDERSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hey, where were you guys? There must have been some really
important stuff going on this past week because I was expecting to
see a bunch of you and hardly anyone showed up.
</P>
<P>
   Oh sure, the faithful few were present but they were the same
faces that I see at every event. What's going on?
</P>
<P>
   I know Dennis Rodman got booted from the Mavericks, so I don't
think you had trouble tearing yourself away from the television.
Super Tuesday went exactly as predicted, so there was no political
David and Goliath to snare your attention. And the weather was
great this past week. So I just don't understand what happened.
</P>
<P>
   The public schools of our community hosted their traditional
open house this past week, and I'm just guessing, but it appeared
that fewer than half of the parents attended the two that I
attended. The halls were so empty you could see your shadow on the
floor. I've seen more people at school board meetings yelling and
screaming than I saw in those classrooms trying to establish a
relationship with the educators before problems arise.
</P>
<P>
   Now, hold on before you get your bloomers in a knot. I know many
of you had legitimate reasons for not attending. No, I have not
attended every single open house that my two sons were involved in.
Some of you had to work or you were out of town. Others had
conflicts in their schedules, and no one can be in two places at
the same time. A few people were ill or had transportation
problems. Some of you didn't even know about it because your child
didn't bring the notice home. I understand. I can't think of
everything, but I realize that there are valid excuses for missing
these events occasionally. Nevertheless, that laundry list doesn't
account for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yes, I work hard too. I went to two open houses this week and
both occurred after a nine-hour workday (and I am not including
lunch). I had a committee meeting, a board meeting and one son's
birthday week. Before and after my day job, I worked on three major
projects and typed a paper for my husband when I wasn't returning
calls, answering e-mails and responding to my pager.
</P>
<P>
   So what? So we're all busy and we're all tired.
</P>
<P>
   But guys, you should have been there.
</P>
<P>
   At my youngest son's school, the kids had each made a stuffed
doll using old clothes and huge, decorated grocery bags for the
head. The girls glued strings of yarn to the bags and curled it to
look like locks of hair. The dolls were sitting at the kids' desks
in their homerooms, all bright eyes and smiles just like I imagine
it must be when the first bell rings each day.
</P>
<P>
   In front of the dolls, was a mountain of our students' best work
in a notebook. On top of the notebook, was a lovely card made in
computer class that said, ``Mom and Dad, Welcome to our Open
House.'' It's not exactly Mardi Gras, but those children worked
really hard preparing for our visit to their classes.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the evening, we got to take the dolls home.
Imagine the disappointment of the youngsters who returned to school
the next day to find their desks exactly as they had left them,
complete with the lovely card to Mom and Dad.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers and principal were there, also tired I'm sure. Yet
they were smiling and saying pleasant things about the children.
This is our second round through the fifth grade, but I want the
teachers to see me when things are going right and not just when
there's a problem.
</P>
<P>
   My parents were educators and I'm telling you, it's better for
your child and you if you show some interest in education before
report cards are passed out. Teaching is hard work, and being a
student is hard work. Don't you enjoy it when someone admires and
appreciates your efforts, especially when they go out of their way
to do it? Of course, you do. We all do.
</P>
<P>
   So, next time, put the date of open house on your calendar early
like you do other important events. Let's fill the schools on that
night like we fill the stadiums when our favorite team makes the
playoffs. Not only is it important, but it's also free and open to
the public.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shallots are like lingerie: a graceful and necessary
underpinning, more appreciated in France than in America, and
increasingly showing up in full view.
</P>
<P>
   The shallot, a member of the onion family that can be peeled,
sliced and chopped without driving the cook to tears, has long been
a crucial component in classic French sauces like bearnaise, Bercy,
bordelaise, beurre blanc, mignonnette, vinaigrette and marchand de
vin.
</P>
<P>
   But now, chefs in New York and elsewhere are showcasing
shallots, roasting, glazing and caramelizing them whole and using
them to garnish salads, vegetables, meat, fish and poultry.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Boulud, the chef and an owner of Daniel and a native of
Lyon, France, has noticed the change in attitude among his American
colleagues. ``Maybe it's because more of them are doing bistro
food,'' he said. ``But I also think they have a better
understanding of the subtleties and refinements of cooking. A
shallot is a step above an onion, and it will sustain its flavor
better in a reduction.''
</P>
<P>
   Shallots ``round out a dish,'' said Kevin Penner, the chef at
Della Femina, who uses them in a mussel risotto and as a confit
with a buffalo fillet. ``They add that onion component that defines
Western cooking, but with more sweetness and less acidity than
onions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Bieber, the chef at Eli's Restaurant, said regular onions
``tend to melt away,'' so he prefers richly caramelized shallots in
his custardy pudding. ``I never used them that much before,'' he
said. ``But I find they add a fuller flavor to a dish.'' Besides,
he added, ``shallots are more easily available now.''
</P>
<P>
   Even supermarket shoppers would agree. Shallots were once as
scarce as fresh ginger in American markets. In the first volume of
``Mastering the Art of French Cooking,'' published in 1964, Julia
Child said that the white part of scallions could be used as a
substitute for shallots, or even left out entirely. But as anyone
who has cooked with shallots knows, omitting their assertively
sweet pungency diminishes a dish.
</P>
<P>
   Most shallots sold in the United States are imported from
France, where they have been cultivated since Charlemagne's time.
Brittany, which grows 75 percent of France's more than 40,000 tons
each year, is the world's largest producer. Exports to America from
France have increased from none in 1980 to 4,525 tons last year,
according to the French National Center for Statistical Research, a
government agency.
</P>
<P>
   Though there are dozens of kinds of shallots, the ones most
frequently sold in America have tawny skins surrounding a pale
mauve bulb. Lately, markets have tended to offer larger and fresher
ones, with a single bulb instead of a cluster, making them much
easier to peel. Shallots are often pear-shaped or rounded, but some
from France are slender ovals.
</P>
<P>
   They can also be pale gold, like the organic ones grown in
upstate New York. Echalotes grises, prized in France, have a
particularly rich flavor and a tough grayish skin. And big, sweet
lavender oval ``torpedo'' shallots, a cross between shallots and
onions, are imported from Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   In Southeast Asia, where shallots are used with abandon, small
reddish ones, similar to the kind sold in Chinatown, are preferred.
In India, members of certain Buddhist sects who do not eat garlic
use shallots instead.
</P>
<P>
   In Asia, shallots are used raw or deep-fried to give a stronger
flavor and a crunchy texture, said Jean-Georges Vongerichten, who
once worked in Thailand. ``And they're usually sliced differently
in Asia _ the long way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   James Chew, a chef and caterer who once worked with
Vongerichten, said shallots are used by the cupful in Vietnam and
Thailand in salads and in dishes like fried rice and mee krob, a
noodle mixture.
</P>
<P>
   Several Asian shops in Chinatown sell jars and cans of crisp
deep-fried shallots imported from Thailand. They do wonders for a
sour cream dip, on top of a string bean casserole or strewn on a
baked potato or a salad.
</P>
<P>
   Whole unpeeled shallots are easy to roast, brushed with oil and
wrapped in foil like garlic. They can be slowly caramelized in
butter with a little sugar, made into a tangy sweet-and-sour pickle
with sugar and vinegar, or cooked until they are soft for a kind of
savory marmalade. At Firebird the chef, Ari Nieminen, roasts them
with apricots to make a jamlike condiment.
</P>
<P>
   Shallots range from 99 cents to $5.99 a pound for organically
grown ones. French shallots are sold in many markets for $2 to $3 a
pound, even though they are subject to a 100 percent tariff imposed
by the government last July in retaliation for the European ban on
American beef with hormones.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Paffenroth, who owns Paffenroth Gardens in Warwick, N.Y.,
sells his shallots for $2 a pound at the Union Square Greenmarket
on Saturdays. He said the green shallot tops are popular among
Asians. Mike Kaloski, a farmer in Cutchogue, N.Y., grows shallots
that are sold in the summer for $1.50 to $2 a pound at farm stands
on the East End of Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Colicchio, the chef at Gramercy Tavern, likes Paffenroth's
shallots because they are small. ``The big ones may be easier to
peel, but the little ones are nicer to bake,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Boulud said that in summer, when shallots have just been
harvested, they have the best flavor for roasting whole. Penner
also prefers freshly harvested shallots, favoring those grown on
Long Island. ``The fresher the better,'' he said. ``When I lived in
East Hampton, I grew my own.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   With shallots so widely available now, not just in summer but
all year, it pays to have a few on hand, kept in a cool, dry place
like potatoes and onions. And when a recipe calls for shallots,
there will be no need to substitute or omit. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In September 1897, the Arctic explorer Robert E.
Peary sailed into New York harbor aboard the Hope with six
Greenland Eskimos to be studied at the American Museum of Natural
History at the request of the anthropologist Franz Boas. Among the
Eskimos were Minik, 6 or 7 years old, a merry boy with a
mischievous expression, and his widowed father, Qisuk.
</P>
<P>
   The next day 20,000 people visited the Hope, paying Peary 25
cents to see the Eskimos, who were still in their Arctic furs.
Eventually they were taken to the museum, where visitors were also
allowed to view them. They lived in the basement, where Minik
seemed happiest playing amid the familiar objects in the Arctic
exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   But the Eskimos, who are commonly referred to as Inuit these
days, had no resistance to the germs in New York. Four, including
Qisuk, died of tuberculosis and another returned to the Arctic,
leaving only Minik.
</P>
<P>
   To appease the grieving boy, Boas staged a funeral for his
father in the garden of the museum on Central Park West. It was a
mock ceremony, with a log wrapped in furs to simulate a body. In
fact the Eskimos had been sent to Bellevue Hospital for dissection.
The flesh was stripped from their bones, which were then bleached
and stored in the museum. Eventually Minik discovered the ruse and
began a lifelong effort to retrieve his father's remains, only to
be rebuffed by the museum at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   Minik's story is told in ``Give Me My Father's Body,'' a book by
Kenn Harper, an Arctic historian and businessman, that is to be
published for the first time in the United States in April by
Steerforth Press.
</P>
<P>
   Harper, 55, initially published the book himself in 1986,
selling copies from his general store in Iqaluit on Baffin Island
to the west of Greenland.
</P>
<P>
   The book reveals new details about Minik's life, including
Minik's account of what happened to him. Harper contends that until
the 1960s the museum lied about still having the remains of Minik's
father and the other Eskimos. Harper portrays Peary, whose claim to
be the first man to reach the Arctic has been disputed, as
egotistical and duplicitous. The Eskimo deaths were a public
relations disaster for Peary, who washed his hands of Minik.
</P>
<P>
   Harper provides new information about Peary's business dealings
with the museum. Peary said his explorations were done ``in the
interests of science.'' But Harper says that the Peary family
papers and the museum's archives reveal that Peary grew rich
selling artifacts to support his expeditions, passing the sales off
as donations with the complicity of the museum's president, Morris
K. Jesup, a wealthy railroader and banker. With Jesup's knowledge,
Harper contends, Peary also illegally imported duty-free furs and
ivory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had also felt a morbid affinity for the bodies of other
Eskimos he knew by name,'' Harper writes of Peary. The year before
Minik arrived, Peary sold the museum the bones of an Eskimo family
he had befriended, Qujaukitsoq, his wife and little girl. Peary had
uncovered their bodies from their graves after they died.
</P>
<P>
   To Harper, who is married to an Inuit and speaks the Eskimo
language Inuktitut, Minik's story ``shows the arrogance and greed
and lack of respect for native people and their culture that was
rampant in the Golden Age of Arctic exploration.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Museum of Natural History was complicit in all of this, in
sponsoring and subsidizing the explorers and in pretending to show
respect for the cultures and native peoples it studied,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The museum counters that the injustices done to Minik and the
other Eskimos were a result of the beliefs of an earlier time. Ian
Tattersall, a curator in the department of anthropology at the
museum, said recently: ``To judge what went on in that time by the
values of today is not very productive. All we could do was take
whatever action we could to put things right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Give Me My Father's Body'' is being published as hundreds of
American museums are cataloging their aboriginal remains to comply
with the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of
1990, which provides for the return of skeletal remains and objects
to native groups. Canadian and Greenlandic Eskimos are not covered
by the act, although Canadian native groups have lobbied for the
return of remains that were taken at the turn of the century.

</P>
<P>
   The American Museum of Natural History is involved in a dispute
with the Clackamas Indians over ownership of the 15-ton Willamette
Meteorite in the new Rose Center for Earth and Space. The meteorite
was donated to the museum after it was bought from an iron company
near Portland, Ore. The Clackamas, who are part of the Confederated
Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community, have asked that it be
returned, arguing that it is a sacred object. Last month the museum
filed suit in U.S. District Court in Manhattan in an effort to keep
the meteorite, saying that it had been part of the landscape of the
area from which it was taken.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Years after Minik arrived in New York, he told a newspaper
reporter from The World about the day he first spotted Peary's ship
sail around Cape York in Greenland: ``I had never seen anything
bigger than my father's kayak. The big ship brought to our little
village more white men than we had ever seen. I lived in a little
igloo with my father. My mother was dead, and I had no brothers or
sisters. And so I loved my dear father very much.''
</P>
<P>
   He told The San Francisco Examiner: ``He was dearer to me than
anything else in the world, especially when we were brought to New
York, strangers in a strange land. You can imagine how closely that
brought us together; how our disease and suffering and lack of
understanding of all the strange things around us ... made us sit
tremblingly waiting our turn to go, more and more lonesome and
alone, hopelessly far from home.''
</P>
<P>
   After his father's death, Minik was put in the care of William
Wallace, the museum's superintendent of buildings, who lived in the
Highbridge section of the Bronx and also had a home in Cobleskill,
N.Y. Then in 1901, Wallace resigned in a scandal over missing
money. Though impoverished, he continued to care for Minik,
appealing unsuccessfully to Jesup for help in feeding, educating
and clothing him.
</P>
<P>
   Under Wallace's care, Minik learned English and attended a Bronx
high school. He caught pneumonia repeatedly but nonetheless
excelled at baseball. He was dogged by an ineluctable sorrow, the
feeling always of being an outsider. When he enrolled at Manhattan
College, he wrote, he felt he was ``a freak to those about me.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1907 Minik discovered that his father had never been buried
and that his bones were in the museum. ``His coffin is a showcase,
his shroud a piece of glass,'' an article in The World said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can never be happy till I can bury my father in a grave,''
the article quoted Minik as saying. ``It makes me cry every time I
think of his poor bones up there in the museum in a glass case,
where everybody can look at them. Just because I am a poor Esquimau
boy, why can't I bury my father in a grave the way he would want to
be buried?''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of his life, Minik begged the museum for the return
of his father's body but was always rebuffed. The museum said it
knew nothing about the bones and told employees to deny that they
were there. Finally Minik, through an intermediary, petitioned
President Theodore Roosevelt to get back the remains. Peary
persuaded the White House to disregard his pleas.
</P>
<P>
   In 1909 Peary, apparently afraid that Minik might reveal that
Peary, a married man, had fathered two children with an Eskimo
woman, allowed Minik, then about 18, to accompany him back to the
Arctic.
</P>
<P>
   Minik relearned his native language and was a guide and
translator. He hoped to lead an Inuit expedition to the North Pole.
He married an Eskimo, but the marriage failed. He grew homesick for
the United States and in 1916 he returned. For some time he was
unable to find work, but eventually he became a lumberjack in
Pittsburg, N.H. There he befriended Afton Hall, another lumberjack,
and was taken in by Hall's family. It was perhaps the happiest
period of his life. But in 1918 the Spanish flu swept the camp, and
Minik died and was buried there. He was believed to be 27 or 28.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, Harper, the author of an Eskimo dictionary, began
hearing about Minik in Qaanaaq, a coastal village in northwestern
Greenland. A former mother-in-law of Harper's from a previous
marriage had known Minik when she was a child. He began researching
Minik's life in newspaper accounts and in the Danish Royal
Archives, the U.S. National Archives and the American Museum of
Natural History's files. In 1992 a reporter for The Toronto Globe
and Mail and a retired Canadian correspondent for The Washington
Post discovered Harper's self-published book and reported that the
remains of Qisuk and the others were still in the museum.
</P>
<P>
   That year the museum sent an emissary, Edmund Carpenter, a
wealthy donor and collector of aboriginal artifacts, to Greenland
to find someone to request the bones' return. Eventually a Lutheran
pastor in Qaanaaq did, and in 1993 they were interred in a church
cemetery at Qaanaaq. Harper describes the laying of a plaque above
the grave by Queen Margrethe II of Denmark and her husband, Prince
Henrik, in 1997. The plaque says in the Eskimo language, ``They
have come home.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   The museum denied that it returned the bones because of press
accounts about Harper's book. ``I don't think I knew about the book
when this thing arose,'' Tattersall, the curator said. ``We did an
audit of our collection and found that we did have some materials
that would not be appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The museum says that Minik's father's bones were never on
display. ``You can tell that from the bones themselves,'' he said.
``They have to be drilled to support the whole skeleton.''
</P>
<P>
   Minik's body remains buried in New Hampshire. He once said that
the bright lights of Broadway had attracted him more than the
northern lights, Harper writes. When he died in New Hampshire among
friends, it may have been the happiest he had ever been.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of aboriginal skeletons are still stored in American
museums. For example, the remains of Qujaukitsoq, his wife and
little girl, which Peary sold to the natural history museum in
1896, are still there, Harper points out, filed under Accession No.
99/105-111.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Canty, a museum spokeswoman, acknowledged that the bones of
seven people were stored in the museum under that number. ``There's
no specific information in the accession file about these
individuals,'' she said. ``Obviously we would seriously consider
returning them if we had information about them. There does need to
be someone who has requested them and who will see that they are
properly cared for once they are returned.''

 &HT;    CONGRESS SET TO FOSTER BROADBAND COMPETITION
 &HT;    410&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS

<P>
   FAIRFAX, Va. _ Congress is likely approve a bill that would let
all businesses offer high-speed Internet access to U.S. homes on an
equal basis, the co-chairmen of the House Internet Caucus predicted
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by a series of mega-mergers, chances for passage of the
Internet Freedom Act have markedly improved in recent months, said
Reps. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., and Rick Boucher, D-Va., who are
steering the measure through the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very close to getting the legislation out of the
committee and onto the House floor,'' Boucher told reporters after
speaking to the Global Internet Summit at George Mason University.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rate our chances for final passage this year at 50-50 or
better,'' Goodlatte said. House passage of the bill, which
Goodlatte forecast would occur in June, ``will motivate the Senate,
which has been in a wait-and-see posture,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The House Commerce Committee is also considering the bill. But
Boucher said that whether or not that panel acts, the measure will
reach the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   The lucrative broadband market is ripe for explosive growth in
coming years.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester Research, a leading analyst of Internet trends,
estimates that the number of high-speed Internet home subscribers
will more than double, to about 6 million, by year's end and will
reach 27 million by 2003. Most of these services are being provided
by cable or telephone outlets, which remain regulated by the
Federal Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The pending bill would impose antitrust penalties against cable
and telecom firms that ``knowingly and willfully fail to provide''
open access to their would-be competitors. It also makes it
unlawful for broadband access providers to compete unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be very cautious about what role the government
should play in the development of the Internet,'' Goodlatte argued.
``As lawmakers, we have to stand aside and let industry
self-regulation work to the maximum extent possible.''
</P>
<P>
   By letting consumers load Web pages almost instantly and enjoy
advanced features such as online video over a full-time connection,
high-speed access is seen as the key to making the Internet a part
of everyday life much like the telephone and television are today.
That, in turn, could unlock the full commercial potential of the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of broadband deregulation was hailed by Ivan
Seidenberg, chairman and chief executive officer of Bell Atlantic
Corp.. Seidenberg joined the two Virginia lawmakers on the summit
panel, along with Steve Case, who heads America Online Inc., the
world's leading Internet service provider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regulation is needed to protect consumers,'' Seidenberg said.
``But the model of regulation needs to be changed lest it create
disincentives for (the telecommunications industry) to do what they
need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the regulatory scene shifted in Congress in
the wake of the merger agreement between Case's AOL and Time Warner
Inc. By combining Time Warner's cable modem services and
proprietary content with AOL's 22 million online subscribers, the
merged company is poised to become a broadband powerhouse. Its top
officers recently pledged to offer open access to its fat Internet
pipes to all would-be entrants in the market.
</P>
<P>
   In a deregulated climate, increased competition would aid such
competitors as Seidenberg's Bell Atlantic, as well as other
regional telecom firms, to step up their efforts to deliver
Internet connections at up to 50 times faster than current dial-up
service.
</P>
<P>
   And building these fatter pipes to the Web will create a need to
fill them with content, as Case pointed out to his summit audience.

RISOTTO YOU STIR LESS AND FLAVOR MORE 
</HEADLINE>
   This is the third of eight columns by Christian Delouvrier, the
executive chef at Lespinasse in Manhattan. They are being written
with Melissa Clark.  
 (Dining)

 By CHRISTIAN DELOUVRIER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To many cooks, risotto is a dish with heavy
connotations: it takes time and attention _ lots of attention _ and
often emerges from all that simmering and stirring in a slightly
leaden state.
</P>
<P>
   What you want from risotto is more ethereal: something that is
luxuriously rich, yet airy and light. And if you can get there
without all the work, so much the better.
</P>
<P>
   I can assure you, it is possible.
</P>
<P>
   First, no restaurant has time to make risotto the traditional
way, which requires 20 straight minutes of standing at the stove as
you saute the rice and then slowly add hot broth. The usual chef's
shortcut calls for cooking the rice partway, then chilling it and
finishing the dish by simmering and stirring just before serving.
</P>
<P>
   My method is not like that at all; in fact, I've actually
eliminated the stirring altogether. My final cooking time is less
than six minutes, and I get such terrific results _ firm grains
suspended in a creamy sauce _ that even if I had the time, I
wouldn't go back to the traditional method.
</P>
<P>
   I learned my shortcut from some colleagues who had worked in the
South of France. They apparently picked it up from some Italian
cooks they met there. Since then, I've seen this method used in
kitchens here and in France.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the day, we simmer arborio rice in white wine, then let
it cool. When an order for risotto comes into the kitchen, we
simply finish the rice by simmering it in a good chicken broth,
then adding a touch of Parmesan cheese along with whatever
flavorings we are using that day. A spoon never comes near the pot
except to dish up the finished risotto.
</P>
<P>
   I take the dish a step further by embellishing it with a
cloudlike ring of foamed liquid spooned over the top at the last
minute. While the foam reinforces the flavors in the risotto, it
also does something far more important: it lifts the earthiness of
the rice and contributes to the sensation of lightness.
</P>
<P>
   Turning liquids into foams is a technique I began to see in
Paris restaurants several years ago. Usually used as a playful
garnish, foams can also add a lot of flavor to a dish, especially
if you start out with an intense liquid.
</P>
<P>
   For example, with a black truffle risotto, I make a foam of
chicken broth scented with black truffle oil; for a tomato risotto,
I infuse the broth with pesto and basil oil. You can experiment
with oils infused with other flavors in the foam, like citrus,
other herbs or spices, or you can flavor the broth itself.
</P>
<P>
   I prepare the foams using a commercial immersion blender fitted
with a ruffled blade, which is a perfect whipping tool. At home,
you can get the same results with a standard immersion blender if
you add frozen butter to the broth as you whip it.
</P>
<P>
   Risotto is a perfect base for showcasing seasonal ingredients.
By itself, it has a relatively neutral taste. Any addition gives it
more dimension. Right now, that means fresh black truffles. Their
magnificent fragrance and lingering flavor are best set off by a
starch, which makes risotto a perfect partner. I also love the way
the dish has the stark black and white color scheme of a
chessboard.
</P>
<P>
   As the weather warms, I look forward to a springtime risotto
with asparagus and lemon. I prepare butter with Meyer lemon juice
and zest and use that for both the risotto and the foam. I add
blanched, sliced asparagus and zest from the lemon to the rice at
the end of cooking. To give the foam an added boost, I add lemon
oil.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer, I use beautiful ripe tomatoes in my risotto. As
good as they are on their own, I intensify the flavor _ and
eliminate some of the moisture that would otherwise dilute the
risotto _ by roasting them in an herb-infused olive oil as you
would with confit.
</P>
<P>
   The possibilities for flavoring risotto are nearly endless, as
long as you stick to a few basic principles. One is to keep
whatever you may add small, not much bigger than the grains of
rice.
</P>
<P>
   Another is to precook the vegetables and stir them into the
risotto at the end of cooking just to heat them up.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, you can switch to vegetables like butternut squash
and puree them before folding them in at the last minute. &QL;

   BLACK WINTER-TRUFFLE RISOTTO &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: about an hour &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces arborio rice (about 3/4 cup)
</P>
<P>
   { cup white wine
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   2 ounces fresh or jarred black winter truffles
</P>
<P>
   2{ cups strong chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons creme fraiche
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon black truffle oil
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine rice and wine.
Simmer mixture until wine is absorbed. Let cool.
</P>
<P>
   2. Cut 2 tablespoons butter into 1/2-inch dice and place in
freezer. Reserve remaining butter at room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   3. Using a stiff brush, clean truffles. If using jarred
truffles, rinse well. Using a truffle slicer, mandoline or sharp
knife, slice 8 thin slices off largest truffle. Coarsely chop
remaining truffles. Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   4. Return rice to stove and add 1 1/4 cups chicken broth to pan.
Simmer until rice is al dente and most of the liquid is absorbed,
about 6 to 7 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   5. While rice is cooking, prepare foam. In another saucepan,
simmer remaining chicken broth. Add creme fraiche and truffle oil
and remove pan from heat. Using an immersion blender, whip mixture,
adding frozen butter cubes gradually. Continue to whip until
mixture is very foamy, about 2 minutes.
</P>

<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Make the tomato confit: Preheat oven to 200 degrees. In an 8
x 8-inch pan, combine olive oil, garlic, coriander, bay leaf and
thyme. Place tomatoes, cut side down, into oil. Cover pan with
foil, poking a hole or two to let steam escape. Bake tomatoes for 2
hours, until very tender and skins pull away from flesh easily.
Cool. Peel tomatoes and chop. Discard oil and seasonings. Makes

Simmer until rice is al dente and most of the liquid is absorbed,
about 6 to 7 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   5. While rice is cooking, prepare foam. In another saucepan,
simmer remaining chicken broth and pesto. Strain through a fine
sieve into a clean bowl and add creme fraiche and basil oil. Using
an immersion blender, whip mixture, adding frozen butter cubes
gradually. Continue to whip until mixture is very foamy, about 2
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   7. Stir one-third cup tomato confit and cheese into rice and
season with salt and pepper to taste. Divide risotto among four
bowls. Rewhip foam if necessary, and spoon it atop risotto and
around inside edges of bowls. Serve immediately.

 &HT;    CONGRESS SET TO FOSTER BROADBAND COMPETITION
 &HT;    410&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAIRFAX, Va. _ Congress is likely approve a bill that would let
all businesses offer high-speed Internet access to U.S. homes on an
equal basis, the co-chairmen of the House Internet Caucus predicted
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by a series of mega-mergers, chances for passage of the
Internet Freedom Act have markedly improved in recent months, said
Reps. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., and Rick Boucher, D-Va., who are
steering the measure through the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very close to getting the legislation out of the
committee and onto the House floor,'' Boucher told reporters after
speaking to the Global Internet Summit at George Mason University.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rate our chances for final passage this year at 50-50 or
better,'' Goodlatte said. House passage of the bill, which
Goodlatte forecast would occur in June, ``will motivate the Senate,
which has been in a wait-and-see posture,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The House Commerce Committee is also considering the bill. But
Boucher said that whether or not that panel acts, the measure will
reach the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   The lucrative broadband market is ripe for explosive growth in
coming years.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester Research, a leading analyst of Internet trends,
estimates that the number of high-speed Internet home subscribers
will more than double, to about 6 million, by year's end and will
reach 27 million by 2003. Most of these services are being provided
by cable or telephone outlets, which remain regulated by the
Federal Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The pending bill would impose antitrust penalties against cable
and telecom firms that ``knowingly and willfully fail to provide''
open access to their would-be competitors. It also makes it
unlawful for broadband access providers to compete unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be very cautious about what role the government
should play in the development of the Internet,'' Goodlatte argued.
``As lawmakers, we have to stand aside and let industry
self-regulation work to the maximum extent possible.''
</P>
<P>
   By letting consumers load Web pages almost instantly and enjoy
advanced features such as online video over a full-time connection,
high-speed access is seen as the key to making the Internet a part
of everyday life much like the telephone and television are today.
That, in turn, could unlock the full commercial potential of the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of broadband deregulation was hailed by Ivan
Seidenberg, chairman and chief executive officer of Bell Atlantic
Corp.. Seidenberg joined the two Virginia lawmakers on the summit
panel, along with Steve Case, who heads America Online Inc., the
world's leading Internet service provider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regulation is needed to protect consumers,'' Seidenberg said.
``But the model of regulation needs to be changed lest it create
disincentives for (the telecommunications industry) to do what they
need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the regulatory scene shifted in Congress in
the wake of the merger agreement between Case's AOL and Time Warner
Inc. By combining Time Warner's cable modem services and
proprietary content with AOL's 22 million online subscribers, the
merged company is poised to become a broadband powerhouse. Its top
officers recently pledged to offer open access to its fat Internet
pipes to all would-be entrants in the market.
</P>
<P>
   In a deregulated climate, increased competition would aid such
competitors as Seidenberg's Bell Atlantic, as well as other
regional telecom firms, to step up their efforts to deliver
Internet connections at up to 50 times faster than current dial-up
service.
</P>
<P>
   And building these fatter pipes to the Web will create a need to
fill them with content, as Case pointed out to his summit audience.

FOOD SITE MATURES WITH GRACE AND BEANS WITH LONG LINEAGE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Minn., Calif., France)  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A good Web site for food, www.sallys-place.com, keeps getting
better. In the last two years it has added well-known guest
writers, restaurant surveys of 15 cities, and a tie-in with sites
specializing in women's issues. Sally's Place, the Internet home of
Sally Bernstein, a San Francisco area food writer, is known for
substantial articles on food and travel, along with restaurant
reviews for 65 cities all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein began the site almost five years ago, an eon in
Internet time. Two years ago, Sally's Place had a folksy look, with
a drawing of a town square for a home page. Today, the home page
gets right down to business, with clear links to departments and
feature articles. But there at the top is a picture of Bernstein in
cheerful red. She wants visitors to her site ``to relate to me as
an individual,'' she explains by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The feature articles in this season include a survey of string
beans, with recipes, by Betty Fussell, a cookbook author and a new
contributor. Others are Anne Willan of La Varenne Cooking School in
Paris, and Bruce Aidells, the sausage maker and co-author with
Denis Kelly of ``The Complete Meat Cookbook.''
</P>
<P>
   A Purim article by Janice Shamberg offers a recipe for
hamantaschen. GraceAnn Walden, a San Francisco Chronicle columnist,
gives the lowdown on dim sum (get a table near the kitchen), with
thumbnail reviews of Chinese restaurants specializing in dim sum on
both coasts.
</P>
<P>
   Scrolling down to ``Food,'' the visitor will find categories
like dining directory (for restaurant reviews), recipes, ethnic
cuisine, farmers' markets and chef's corner (covering kitchen tools
and cooking schools).
</P>
<P>
   In a change that reflects the growing corporatism of the
Internet, Bernstein has affiliated her site with the Web site
womensforum.com, a mall of 60 sites, half a dozen of those about
food. The mall does advertising and public relations for its
tenants and helps with software suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   Now a pull-down menu at Sally's Place will take the Net surfer
to sites like the Ex-Wives and Second Wives clubs, Bridal Zine and
the Women's Resource Center. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Hill of Beans  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Butterscotch Calypso bean, also called the Steuben Yellow
Eye, was developed in the 1600s and was probably the original
Boston baked bean. The Chestnut Lima Bean, also known as the
Christmas Lima, was popular into the 1920s and has burgundy and
white markings, which it keeps even when cooked. The pale green
flageolet, first produced in 19th-century France, was a favorite of
the chef Escoffier and became a staple of French and Mediterranean
cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   These are some of the heirloom beans collected and sold by
Indian Harvest of Bemidji, Minn. (www.indianharvest.com), which
specializes in exotic rices, beans and grains. Heirloom beans, as
the company defines them, are grown from seed that is handed down
from generation to generation. Indian Harvest sells most of its
beans, including Butterscotch Calypso, Chestnut Lima and Green
Flageolet, for $6.95 for 1.5 pounds and $12.95 for three pounds. A
heritage sampler for $21.95 contains eight-ounce bags of eight
other uncommon varieties. Beans and rice together form a complete
protein, making them an equivalent to meat, which means the site is
a good resource for cooks looking for alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   The grains and rice are also far from typical supermarket fare,
for instance, black barley from Ethiopia ($7.95 for 1.5 pounds) and
black Japonica rice and Himalayan red rice ($8.95 for 1.5 pounds).
Eight-ounce packages of those plus four others are available in an
exotic grain sampler for $22.95.
</P>
<P>
   The site also sells multigrain blends, bowls, cookers and
steamers and has recipes and cooking tips for its far-flung
products.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Say you're having dinner somewhere hot on a hot date,
and things are moving to the next level, when a cancerous cloud
wafts across your table. Four people at the next booth seem to have
lighted up a pack of Marlboros simultaneously. A waiter hurries
over _ and hands them an ashtray. Your date begins to cough.
</P>
<P>
   This was not supposed to happen in New York anymore. Smoking in
restaurants with more than 35 seats has been banned since the
Smoke-Free Air Act was passed in 1995. Even anti-smoking advocates,
content to have won the war over the dining room, have shifted
their crusade to the bar. But while fewer diners may be consuming
first- or secondhand smoke, a newly hardened resistance is digging
in. Social and serial smokers are puffing away at an underground
network of restaurants that would rather risk a health inspection
than alienate valued customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't enforce the law,'' said Raju Mirchandani, who owns two
East Side bistros, Le Bateau Ivre and L'Ivre. ``I prefer to leave
it on a courtesy basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Mirchandani said 90 percent of his clientele smokes, ``so the
majority rules.'' He has had inspectors come in and post the
necessary signs. ``But in most cases, people ignore them, and we
look the other way.'' And nobody complains? ``You get the odd
person who snarls at the smoke, but they don't say anything. They
just don't come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Friedman is one of those people: the passive nonsmoker.
The last time he was victimized by other people's smoke, he said he
``did the sort of wimpy eye-rolling, but that was it.''
</P>
<P>
   It happened at Waterloo Brasserie, the Belgian restaurant at
Washington and Charles Streets, where the clothing usually matches
the mussel shells. Friedman, who writes cookbooks for a living, was
next to a table of four, who fired up and had an ashtray handed to
them by their waiter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to smoke,'' he said. ``I really don't care. But these
people were on top of us. And neither they nor the waiter asked
us.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Waterloo's owners, Aymen Bourjini, said he allows smoking
but tries to secure the consent of nonsmoking diners. ``The later
crowd wants to smoke,'' he said. ``We let them around 11:30 or
12.''
</P>
<P>
   At a City Council hearing convened three weeks ago to assess how
effective the Smoke-Free Air Act has been, Dr. Neal L. Cohen, the
commissioner of health, announced that in 1999 his inspectors found
751 violations in the five boroughs, down from 895 the previous
year. The list runs the gustatory gamut from McDonald's and
Sushiden to Harry Cipriani.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that statistic means less smoking or simply relaxed
enforcement is debatable. None of the restaurant owners interviewed
for this article said they had received a notice of violation. And
some who had, denied it. ``We do not permit smoking, ever, except
at the bar,'' said Hassan Elgarrahy, general manager of Harry
Cipriani, despite the Health Department citation.
</P>
<P>
   Where the rich, famous or putatively hip gather, you will often
find smoke. It tends to be a late-night thing. The menu at the new
71 Clinton, with fewer than 35 seats, on the Lower East Side, even
encourages it, declaring, ``Smoking permitted after dinner hours''
on the same line where it prohibits cell phones. Places cultivating
European or louche ambience have to allow smoking by their louche
European (or American) patrons. The relationship between the smoker
and the smoked upon at such establishments is distinctly
hierarchical: a tyranny of the minority. The smokers are the cool
ones, cowing nonsmokers into silent fuming. For many New Yorkers,
the desire not to seem unsophisticated is even stronger than the
instinct to complain. And so, much off-the-books smoking goes
unreported.
</P>
<P>
   Anna Kriston, 26, an Austrian businesswoman who has lived in New
York for three and a half years, has a personal Zagat's of
smoke-friendly restaurants. A favorite is Les Halles, on Park
Avenue South, where she has dinner once or twice a week. Les Halles
was in the brasserie business 10 years before it was fashionable to
be. The walls look genuinely nicotine-stained, not as if one of
Keith McNally's decorators had spent hours touching them up.
</P>
<P>
   One recent night there, Kriston was with a group of friends:
Moroccans, Europeans, some Americans. Many of them began smoking,
as is their wont, and were supplied with ashtrays. She said she
usually waits until late in the evening, when the place starts
emptying out. But this time it was only about 10, maybe 10:30.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We normally ask around, but I guess we'd had a lot of wine,''
Kriston said.
</P>
<P>
   Camelia Cassin, the manager at Les Halles, said her smoking
section by the bar is so small _ just four tables _ that late at
night she relaxes the rules. ``I have no problem with letting
people smoke,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When the rules are not broken, they are sometimes creatively
interpreted. The law allows smoking in the bar area of any
restaurant. The management of L'Actuel, the glamorous brasserie on
East 50th Street, extends the definition of bar to include lounge
tables in the front. There Sonny Mehta, the editor in chief of
Aldred A. Knopf, sat one afternoon last month, smoking through
lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Christophe Lhopitault, an owner and the general manager of
L'Actuel, said he is eager to accommodate smokers and nonsmokers
alike. ``We have a smoking section, but we won't use it if we have
too many nonsmokers,'' he said. ``If I get any complaints, I'll ask
the smoker not to smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Health Department's complaint line gets news of a smoking
violation, it is supposed to dispatch an inspector. As with other
health code violations, the restaurant's management has the option
of defending itself at a hearing or just paying a fine, which runs
from $200 to $2,000, for repeat offenders. (In California, which
extended its no-smoking laws to bars two years ago, the fines start
at $100 for a first offense and go up to $7,000 for a fourth.)
</P>
<P>
   But even $2,000 is small potatoes, considering the big tabs
smokers rack up. ``They stay longer, they drink more,'' Mirchandani
said. ``They're better customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Some New York restaurateurs say that inspections may be
happening less now. Mirchandani said smoke-friendly establishments
like his ``haven't been busted as much as they used to be busted.''
He thinks the city has lightened up on lighting up. ``I don't think
it's compliance,'' he said of the decreased number of violations.
``I think they've eased up.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Health Department had backed off, John Gadd, a
spokesman, said, ``Inspections are done on a routine basis and in
response to complaints.''
</P>
<P>
   A restaurant owner in a trendily bohemian section of Brooklyn,
who asked not to be named because he did not want inspectors
snooping around, said that 95 percent of his clientele smokes. ``I
lie and say we're under 35 seats,'' he said, adding, ``I've never
had a serious complaint, and I've never had the Health Department
check me out.''
</P>
<P>
   The owner, a smoker himself, is part of a this-ain't-California
brigade. ``For me, the idea that I could eat a steak and have an
appetizer and a glass of wine and have a cigarette in between is a
nice idea,'' he said. ``Otherwise, it just becomes this food thing,
and you eat it quickly and go out to a bar to smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   If he went to the Morrell Wine Bar and Cafe in Rockefeller
Center, his presence would be noisily noted by the ventilation
system, which makes a sound like a bug zapper when ingesting large
quantities of smoke. ``I don't want to be drawing in smokers,''
said Deirdre Regan, the general manager.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-smoking movement, led by Coalition for a Smoke-Free New
York, has unwittingly ensured that cigarettes have regained their
status as instruments of transgression. Christopher Buckley, the
author of the 1994 novel ``Thank You for Smoking,'' observed that
restaurant smoking has become ``a recherche pleasure, and slightly
dangerous: you might be asked to leave.''

A SURPRISE CANDIDATE FOR ROASTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (Dining)  
 (af)  
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lamb shoulder is a bony cut of meat that can easily
be turned into a boneless roast by someone with the proper
experience. I'm not suggesting that you are that someone _ neither
am I _ but any butcher, including those who work in supermarkets,
can and will perform this task pretty quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a round, tied piece of meat with lovely crevices
into which you can stuff a simple seasoning mixture, like garlic
and parsley. This is a traditional combination for seasoning lamb,
and rightly so, because the flavors marry so well.
</P>
<P>
   What is not traditional, or at least not common, is roasting
lamb shoulder. I first had the dish at a bistro in Paris, and it
was lovely _ tender inside, crisp outside, and richly flavored.
When I decided to tackle it myself and asked colleagues for their
advice, I confirmed what I already knew: everyone braised lamb
shoulder. Outside my bistro experience, I'd never had it roasted
either.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this isn't surprising, because like the corresponding
cuts of pork and beef, lamb shoulder is fattier _ and more
flavorful _ than cuts from the hindquarter. Braising _ cooking
slowly in liquid _ renders the fat. It also tenderizes tougher
cuts, like chuck or brisket of beef.
</P>
<P>
   But lamb does not need to be braised to be tender.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the temperature is kept relatively low _ 300 degrees
is best _ roasting renders the fat just as well as braising. A
short boost of oven heat during the last 15 minutes or so of
roasting guarantees a browned, crisp exterior unlike anything you
can get from braising.
</P>
<P>
   The ideal degree of doneness is just short of well done, a stage
at which the meat achieves the best combination of tenderness,
flavor and leanness.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is no denying that the shoulder is a fatty cut, so
it pays to ask the butcher to remove as much surface fat as
possible. (In my experience, it also pays to phone ahead, or to
plan to spend some time shopping while the butcher does his thing.)
Most shoulders weigh in at three to four pounds after boning,
making this simple roast enough to serve six to eight people. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BONELESS LAMB ROAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: About 2 hours &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 cup parsley leaves
</P>
<P>
   4 medium or 2 large cloves garlic
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   About 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 3- to 4-pound boned lamb shoulder, trimmed of surface fat. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Mince parsley and garlic
together until quite fine (a small food processor will work for
this). Add a big pinch of salt, some pepper and enough olive oil to
make a slurry. Smear this on and into lamb, making sure to get it
in every nook and cranny possible. Put lamb in a roasting pan lined
with foil (to facilitate cleanup).
</P>
<P>
   2. Roast for about 1{ hours, basting with pan juices every 30
minutes or so. When internal temperature reaches 140 degrees, turn
heat to 400 degrees and roast about 10 minutes more, or until
internal temperature is 150 degrees and exterior has browned
nicely.
</P>
<P>
   3. Let roast sit for about 10 minutes, then carve and serve with
some of its juices.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: At least 6 servings.

<P>
   Q: Where can I purchase a ``Trailer Trash Barbie-type fashion
doll'' other than eBay?
</P>
<P>
   _ K.S., Arlington, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: The mail-order retailer Poor White Trash is selling a
``trailer trash doll'' for $48.
</P>
<P>
   The doll, the subject of several media reports, is a
Barbie-style doll complete with a cigarette, a blackened tooth,
curlers in her hair, a beer can and a ``dirty-faced baby on hip.''
</P>
<P>
   The company also sells a Ken-style doll that wears women's
clothing; a street-walking Barbie-style doll; and ``Dukes of
Hazzard'' memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   To order, write to Box 1239, Los Altos, CA 94023-1239, or visit
the Web site www.powhitetrash.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Sycamore School Road in Fort Worth does not have a school on
it today. What was it named after?
</P>
<P>
   _ J.T., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: The road takes its name from a one- or two-room school that
was located at the corner of Sycamore School and Crowley roads for
50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Billy W. Sills, a volunteer archivist for the Fort Worth ISD,
found records on the school dating back to 1884. ``That area was
known as the Sycamore School District No. 64,'' Sills said. ``It
was probably named for Sycamore Creek.''
</P>
<P>
   The school appears to have closed in 1940, Sills said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: On a recent episode of ``Once and Again,'' a book of poetry
was discussed, and I think the name was ``North River Wind'' or
something like that. Is it a real book?
</P>
<P>
   _ P.F., via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: According to fans of the show on the rec.arts.tv Internet
discussion group, the poem featured on the show was ``George
Gray,'' from the book ``Spoon River Anthology'' by Edgar Lee
Masters.
</P>
<P>
   The book, first published in 1914, contains 244 monologues by
real and imagined inhabitants of Spoon River, Ill.

<P>
   After a long day at school, Vanessa comes home and tosses her
backpack on the couch. She plops down on the floor, grabs her
keyboard and _ instantly _ she's in the middle of a chat with TV
star Jennifer Aniston about who should be president. In a flurry of
dancing fingers, she's zapping e-mails to Aniston and other
participants from around the world, voicing her views.
</P>
<P>
   The next minute, she's watching an animated soap opera in which
the characters are as varied and well, as real, as the people she
knows at school. Vanessa looks at the time and realizes she needs
to do her history homework, so she clicks over to her browser to
research the life of a local historical figure. All of this, from
her television.
</P>
<P>
   Think this is a teeny-bopper Web dream of the future? So wrong.
It's VOXXY, an interactive cable network geared to teen-age girls,
and a new dimension in grrrl entertainment that's coming to a
living room _ yours, maybe _ as soon as this year.
</P>
<P>
   VOXXY _ derived from the Latin word ``vox,'' meaning voice, and
the letters ``xx,'' which stand for the female chromosomes _ will
begin streaming its programming to the Web in late spring. Computer
software-supported boxes placed atop television sets, to be
introduced toward the end of this year, will allow viewers to watch
TV and interact on the Web at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``VOXXY is not just a Web site,'' says the network's co-founder,
Hillary Carlip. ``It's a fully interactive cable channel.'' VOXXY's
goal is to offer cutting-edge entertainment for young
Internet-savvy users, going beyond the realm of a Web site or cable
channel to provide a full package of smart, empowering
entertainment that will appeal to a diverse group of girls.
</P>
<P>
   Former MTV and network-television producer Kristi Kaylor teamed
up with Carlip, author of ``Girl Power: Young Women Speak Out,''
and Maxine Lapiduss, a Hollywood producer who has written for
``Ellen'', ``Roseanne'' and ``Home Improvement,'' to form an
alliance that has spawned this ambitious leap into high-tech girl
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   So what exactly is VOXXY? The key words to describe the network
appear to be ``smart'' and ``authentic.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlip describes the network as a place for girls who want
thought-provoking entertainment. ``We've found that there's really
not a place (on television) for smart girls,'' she says. ``A lot of
girls grew up on the Internet with a mouse in hand; they're living
and thriving on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she says, many teens can't relate to shows like
``90210'' and ``Dawson's Creek.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to give girls authentic programming where everyone
isn't a size 2 and perfect, and where everything isn't wrapped up
perfectly at the end of every episode,'' Carlip says.
</P>
<P>
   For example, she says, ``That's What Friends Are For,'' a dating
show, embodies the spirit of VOXXY. Instead of female contestants
asking questions directly to male contenders, the bachelor's mom,
best friend and ex-girlfriend will be quizzed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show is really interactive with viewers at home and on the
show,'' co-founder and VOXXY President Kaylor adds. Viewers _
possibly ex-girlfriends! _ may participate by sending V-mails
(that's what e-mails are called in VOXXY land) that instantly
appear on a plasma screen for the contestant to view. This, says
Kaylor, gives contestants a chance to get the real scoop before
making a choice.
</P>
<P>
   Other scheduled programming includes an animated teen soap
opera, live concerts and a bilingual sitcom produced by Galan
Entertainment. VOXXY will also promote satellite sites such as
www.girlpower.com, based on Carlip's nationally recognized book
that voices the hopes and dreams of girls ages 13 to 19 through
their stories, poems and letters. The site currently posts reviews
and excerpts from ``Girl Power: Young Women Speak Out,'' and Carlip
is in the process of gathering renowned authors to create writing
exercises for the Web site. The writers will be available for
online critiquing sessions.
</P>
<P>
   VOXXY's co-founders are also counting on star power to be a draw
for teens. This year, Jennifer Aniston of ``Friends'' fame agreed
to create 13 half-hour episodes of original programming, during
which she will interact with girls on a wide range of issues.
</P>
<P>
   Aniston was at the top of their wish list, both Kaylor and
Carlip say, because of what they see as the actress's genuineness
and her eagerness to make a difference in young girls' lives.
</P>
<P>
   It's important for girls to see that Aniston is just like them
in many ways, Kaylor says. ``Even though she's a star and has a
really cute boyfriend (Brad Pitt), she's still just a person, and
that's empowering.''
</P>
<P>
   Another key to VOXXY, say the women behind it, is that the
concept of girl empowerment spreads across racial and economic
lines in terms of programming content.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have characters of all sizes,'' Kaylor says. ``We have
black, Asian and Latino characters. It's not just your white,
middle-class girls. We're really trying to reach every girl
possible to make it a home and a community.''
</P>
<P>
   So that's what VOXXY is, but how will the high-tech network
work?
</P>
<P>
   VOXXY will begin as a strictly Web-based production. The
programming, heavy in short video streams, will be best viewed with
a high-speed computer modem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're building the Web experience for high-end users,'' says
Dewey Reid, creative director at Red Sky Interactive, the computer
software and network company that's creating VOXXY'S layout. But he
says that people with slower modems will still be able to enjoy
VOXXY's content _ they'll just miss out on some of the video
streams.
</P>
<P>
   Those with at least a 56K modem will have a good viewing
experience, while people with a Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) _ a
faster Internet connection _ will have a better one. (For the
high-tech challenged: DSL uses existing two-wire copper telephone
wiring and in most cases doesn't require an additional phone line.
It is available through Southwestern Bell, GTE, Charter
Communications, Internet America and AT&AMP;T.)
</P>
<P>
   Currently, AT&AMP;T is working to complete VOXXY's boxes, which are
to be set on top a TV; they should be available at the end of this
year or the beginning of 2001. Once construction of the set-top
boxes is finished, VOXXY will blossom into a dual experience,
combining Internet and television elements.
</P>
<P>
   VOXXY viewers will be able to attach keyboards to their
television, watch VOXXY's programming and log onto the Internet
from the same location. Those who don't have the set-top boxes will
simply use the television and Internet separately.
</P>
<P>
   Will VOXXY change the world with its grrrl empowerment message?
Probably not. But if the plans live up to expectations, the network
looks like a strong step in the direction of quality entertainment
for young women.
</P>
<P>
   ``VOXXY is a new generation of `Web TV,''' Kaylor says. ``We're
taking it a step beyond with unique ways for girls to empower
themselves. We came together to give girls a voice.''

&HT;     FREQUENT BINGE DRINKING IS UP ON CAMPUS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAN FREEDMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More and more college students are moving away from
moderate drinking and into either heavy drinking or total
abstention, according to a Harvard School of Public Health survey
released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The study of some 14,000 students at 119 four-year colleges
nationwide last year classified 22.7 percent of the respondents as
``frequent'' binge drinkers. Those are men consuming five drinks or
more in a row at least three times over two-weeks, or women
consuming four drinks or more with the same frequency over the same
time period.
</P>
<P>
   That 22.7 percent represents nearly a three-percentage-point
rise from the survey's 1993 figure of 19.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, the population of tea-totaling college
students rose from 15.4 percent of respondents in 1993 to 19.2
percent in 1999, a rise of nearly four percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is growing polarization on drinking among college
students,'' said Henry Wechsler, a Harvard psychologist who
directed the study, speaking at a press conference in Boston.
``Nearly every college is thinking about this problem and
confronting it one way or another, but despite all the attention
there has been no national improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Wechsler first popularized the term ``binge drinking'' in a
study of Massachusetts college students published in 1992 in the
Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, binge drinking among college youth has become a
major issue on campus. Instances of students dying after heavy
drinking have received wide publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Among them: A University of Virginia senior who died in 1997
after consuming beer and margaritas and falling down a flight
stairs, and a Massachusetts Institute of Technology freshman who
drank himself to death at a fraternity party the same year.
</P>
<P>
   Colleges and universities have responded with educational
programs and policies aimed at making it harder for students to
obtain quantities of alcoholic beverages.
</P>
<P>
   A second Harvard survey of 734 college administrators also
released Tuesday found that 96.6 percent reported instituting
alcohol education programs. Also, 98.2 percent reported banning
beer kegs in dorms; 87 percent banned kegs in fraternities and
sororities; 89.6 percent restricted advertising at home sports
events, and 62 percent offered students alcohol-free dorms or dorm
floors.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these efforts, the overall binge-drinking level has
remained steady since 1993 at 44 percent, said Wechsler. That's
about two students in five.
</P>
<P>
   This category of binge drinking is defined as a man drinking
five drinks in a row at least once over two weeks or a woman
consuming four drinks over the same time period. It is distinct
from ``frequent'' binge drinking, which entails consuming the same
amounts at least three times in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``My disappointment is that given all the attention placed on it
(by colleges and universities), it has remained remarkably
stable,'' Wechsler said.
</P>
<P>
   Many college students fall into binge drinking because they are
away from home and anxious to test the limits of their new-found
freedom, said Joel Wiegert, a University of Nebraska student and
self-described former binge drinker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the experimenter It was a scary time,'' he told the news
conference. Under the influence, Wiegert said, he insulted people,
said ``dumb things'' and broke a table.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to break away from a campus culture where ``drinking
is the focus of what's going on,'' Wiegert said. ``A party without
beer doesn't make much sense in that culture.''
</P>
<P>
   But gradually Wiegert stepped away from it, thanks to his
parents and the university's anti-alcohol educational efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Wiegert said he still likes ``to go out and have a beer with
friends but five or six, or 10 or 15 is not for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey showed that frequent binge drinking affects not just
those who are doing it. Among non-binge drinkers and abstainers, 58
percent reported being interrupted while studying or sleeping by
student carousing, 50 percent said they had taken care of a drunken
fellow student, and 29 percent reported being insulted or
humiliated.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem, Wechsler said, is the easy availability of
relatively inexpensive alcohol, as well as bars near campuses that
lure students with specially priced drinks. And the students who
qualify in the survey as frequent binge drinkers mostly view
themselves as moderate drinkers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor is the easy availability of phony ID cards
showing a student is 21 or older.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the major growth industries among some young
people,'' said Phillip Jones, vice president for student services
at the University of Iowa, who also took part in the press
conference. ``The ID problem is horrendous.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the answer to campus binge drinking is ``we have to
keep at it,'' Wechsler said. ``We can't suffer from attention
deficit disorder by worrying about it for a time and then
forgetting it.''
</P>
<P>
   Administrators must get municipal and community leaders in
college towns involved, Wechsler added. In the second survey, only
39.9 percent of administrators reported reaching cooperative
agreements with surrounding communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This cannot be done by universities alone,'' Wechsler said.

&HT;     ROAD RAGE CLAIMS A CUDDLY VICTIM 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When a furious motorist grabbed Leo the bichon
frise from his owner's car and hurled him into oncoming traffic in
San Jose, Calif., millions of Americans were horrified.
</P>
<P>
   It was a particularly vicious, senseless example of road rage.
What kind of monster would take out revenge for a fender-bender on
a harmless, adorable lapdog?
</P>
<P>
   White, fluffy Leo has posthumously become a celebrity, a
full-scale criminal investigation has been launched and reward
money offered for the killer has reached $100,000. In this country,
we take our pets seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of our pet population vary, but perhaps 54 million
dogs frolic in households across America, outnumbered only by
domestic cats, of which there are some 68 million. The feline
numerical superiority may be due to their tidier nature and the
fact they do not require leashes and regular walks. But it cannot
be because they offer more emotional gratification.
</P>
<P>
   A cat can be a friendly lap-sitting, purring companion, so long
as this happens strictly on his own terms. But a dog is an entire
lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Leo's death caused a national sensation because dog owners
everywhere empathized with the suffering of this owner as she
watched her beloved pet crushed on a busy highway. We know that in
the normal course of events we will always outlive our dogs, who
have an average life span of 12 years. But that doesn't make the
loss easier to bear when the time comes.
</P>
<P>
   I just lost my own bichon frise to cancer. His caring and
competent veterinarian, Dr. Wesley Bayles, cried with us when
Charlie gave in to the malignant tumor.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie was 13 years old and he ran the household, which
revolved around the fact that he loved being loved and reciprocated
at every opportunity. He stuck so close to us when we were home he
was constantly underfoot; we concluded he must think his name was
Movecharlie because that's what we said to him so often.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie demanded attention and we were happy to give it. He and
his resident brother, a tabby cat named Teddy, had a regular
routine of chasing, paw-waving, barking, meowing and generally
putting on a show for humans. Later, like buddies, they would lie
down next to each other and sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie's senior years were full of tail-wagging and curiosity
about the world around him, particularly about other dogs met and
sniffed on our walks. But he was no good as a watch dog. He was so
friendly that when a burglar broke into the back door, Charlie
didn't sound an alarm; the burglar brought doggie treats and a
grateful Charlie generously pointed out the direction to the
silverware.
</P>
<P>
   My husband and I were goofy about our bichon; we miss him
horribly. He thought he was people, and we did too.
</P>
<P>
   We are not alone in the dedicated pampering of a pooch.
Americans tend to treat their pets almost like their children,
seeking the best for them in food, grooming and health care. Pricey
dog fashions _ coats, sweaters, collars _ were on display last year
at a Canine Couture show in New York. There are dog spas, dog gyms,
doggy day care and doggy menus at some carry-out cafes.
</P>
<P>
   The grocery store shelves of dog and cat food in my neighborhood
run along a whole aisle, catering to every taste. The pet food
industry is big business. Millions of Americans buy their dogs
Christmas presents, usually the edible variety. Lapdogs get bows in
their hair.
</P>
<P>
   Dogs are so popular that it is traditional for American
presidents to own dogs to humanize their image. President Clinton
didn't get a dog until well into his second term, when he acquired
Buddy, a chocolate Labrador. The delay was a mistake; Clinton
needed help and a cat named Socks didn't quite measure up.
</P>
<P>
   There is also an emerging field of animal rights law, which
seeks to set judicial standards for the humane treatment of both
domestic pets and animals in the wild by giving them ``legal
personhood.'' This sounds like a bit much to me, but the outrage
over Leo's death suggests why it may have some cultural traction.
</P>
<P>
   There are always people who dislike dogs, perhaps because they
have been bitten. It happens.
</P>
<P>
   But I feel sorry for them. We dog lovers would rather enjoy our
four-legged friends for a limited span than never to have had the
joy of their company at all. We may spoil them, but a wonderful
time is had by all.

<P>
   As I type these words on a late afternoon, I can see the Chicago
River just outside my office window in the gloam of a Monday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   To the east, the river is a sturdy shade of steel gray-blue _
but under the Michigan Avenue Bridge, that fine color gives way to
an artificial green.
</P>
<P>
   It's quite putrid. We're talking about a green usually found
only in Jo Anne Worley's closet, circa ``Laugh-In.'' Think lime
meets chartreuse and they both spill their drinks. If your daughter
came home from college with her hair this shade, you'd cut off her
tuition support.
</P>
<P>
   The city dyes the river every year as part of our ever-expanding
St. Patrick's Day festivities, which include thousands of beer
promotions at local taverns (``Win your own genuine Irish pub!'');
dozens of ``St. Patrick's Day Sales'' at all kinds of stores;
several skyscrapers (including the Hancock Building and Sears
Tower) bathing their crowns in green lights; two huge parades;
dozens of concerts, dances and parties.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yeah, and some people go to church.
</P>
<P>
   For the year 2000 we're actually getting a St. Patrick's Day
week. March 17 doesn't arrive until Friday, but Mayor Daley won't
allow weekday parades in the city unless it's a legal holiday _ so
we had the Chicago march last Saturday, followed the next day by
the South Side Irish Parade.
</P>
<P>
   This gives us plenty of time to nurse our hangovers and rest our
``Danny Boy'' vocal chords so we can return strong and rowdy for
the 17th. (Or to continue hibernating while growling about all the
overserved boobs who turn this March Madness into ``Amateur
Night.'')
</P>
<P>
   Not that there's typically any serious trouble related to
Chicago's version of Mardi Gras. In fact, considering the volume of
alcohol consumed and the sheer numbers of revelers at the various
parades and inside the bars, it's a miracle that St. Patrick's Day
isn't marred by rampant hooliganism. You're more likely to see two
big red-haired lugnuts singing and hugging than swinging and
slugging each other.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one disturbing trend that surfaces every year at
this time, and it's reason enough to keep me out of the pubs for
the most part. Something so insanely goofy that I cringe just
thinking about it.
</P>
<P>
   I'm talking about American guys doing Irish accents.
</P>
<P>
   We don't imitate Pope John Paul II on Casimir Pulaski Day and
unless we're John Rocker-heads we sure don't lampoon Martin Luther
King's dialect on the day named in his honor; we don't do Italian
or Mexican accents on the designated dates on which we honor those
great cultures.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish voice, though _ too many Chicago-area men can't resist
doing it. Even worse, some of them lapse into it while in the
presence of Irish natives.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen it happen, more than once. A guy who was born in
Little Company of Mary Hospital, attended St. Thomas More grade
school and went to Brother Rice or Mt. Carmel followed by a stint
at DePaul _ in other words, he's never lived anywhere but here _
will be talking in his normal ``Chi-caw-guh'' voice when he's
introduced to someone from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   Six beers later, the Chicago guy is sounding like Brendan Behan
on a bender, calling the waitress ``lass'' and ordering ``another
four pints for me and the lads,'' even though everybody at the
table is drinking Bud Light. It's ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone thinks the Irish accent is easy to do, but it's not.
For proof of that, consider that many trained and famous American
thespians have butchered the voice, from Tom Cruise in ``Far and
Away'' to Richard Gere in ``The Jackal'' to Julia Roberts in
``Michael Collins'' to Brad Pitt in ``The Devil's Own'' to Danny
Noonan's girlfriend in ``Caddyshack.''(I still can't figure out why
she was an Irish girl.) They're all so cartoonishly overwrought
that you half-expect to hear them say, ``Always after me Lucky
Charms!'' and be done with it.
</P>
<P>
   If any of the aforementioned is ever given a lifetime
achievement award, don't expect to see their Irish schtick in the
highlight montage, unless someone is trying to get some easy
laughs.
</P>
<P>
   So if most pros can't wrap their voices around the Irish accent,
what chance to the amateurs have? Let it go, boys.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, it's almost always a male tendency. As we've noted here
before, women rarely do impersonations or accents in public because
they know how nutty it makes them sound, whereas men insist on
doing their ethnic voices and their celebrity impersonations
because they're, well, stupid men.
</P>
<P>
   Have all the fun you want with this extended faux-holiday, but
unless you're trying to be a buffoon, don't sport the ``Kiss Me,
I'm Irish'' button all day, don't say ``Top 'o the mornin' to ya!''
to anyone, don't order the green-tinted beer, don't wear the gag
Leprechaun-print tie to work _ and leave the Irish accent in the
shower.

 &HT;    
 By RICK LYMAN  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    ``I do look back on my life for certain lessons that I have
learned,'' said Otis Chandler, the man who was publisher of The Los
Angeles Times for 20 years, from 1960 to 1980.
 &HT;    ``I do look back with great appreciation for the kind of life
I've led, which has been fascinating. But I tend to live in the
moment and look forward to the future. So I don't sit in an office
surrounded by Los Angeles Times photos and memorabilia and Pulitzer
Prizes. No, I don't.''
 &HT;    Which makes it all the more surprising that Otis Chandler has
emerged, after a self-imposed silence of almost a decade, as
something of a latter-day hero to many newspaper journalists around
the country, a prophet lamenting in the wilderness.
 &HT;    For more than a quarter-century, beginning with his unexpected
rise at age 33 to the position of publisher of The Los Angeles
Times, which had been run by his father and grandfather and
great-grandfather before him, Chandler was a figure of the first
importance in the nation's second most important metropolis.
 &HT;    Late last year Chandler spoke out, chastising his successors at
The Los Angeles Times and charging that its bottom-line, Wall
Street-oriented management had compromised the reputation and
editorial integrity of his family's paper. His words echoed through
hundreds of newsrooms.
 &HT;    And they played against a backdrop of great change and anxiety
in the newspaper business, as increasing corporate ownership has
led to an era of cost-cutting and an obsession with stock prices.
 &HT;    During his 20 years as publisher Chandler was instrumental in
transforming The LA Times from a dreadful newspaper into one of the
two or three best in the country.
 &HT;    If his power came with a certain reputation for oddness _
fueled, perhaps, by a clear preference for outdoor derring-do over
the trappings of media mogulhood, as well as an assortment of
rich-guy hobbies like racing Porsches and hunting big game _ well,
that just made him more interesting, harder to categorize.
 &HT;    Then in 1980, he relinquished the job unexpectedly, though he
continued to serve for the next five years as chairman of the
parent company.
 &HT;    By the 1990s, his trips to Los Angeles were increasingly rare,
mostly to attend board meetings (he remained a director until 1998)
or to visit his celebrated but by then infirm mother, Dorothy
Buffum Chandler, who died in 1997.
 &HT;    Chandler hasn't been inside the Los Angeles Times building since
his final annual shareholder's meeting two years ago, and he says
he no longer feels welcome there. Many of the people in its
newsroom these days have never laid eyes on him.
 &HT;    ``The truth is, Otis was a symbol from the day he took over The
Times until the day he left, and still is today,'' said Bill
Thomas, editor of the paper for almost 18 years, during much of the
period that it was being transformed.
 &HT;    Chandler, now 72, stepped onto the public stage again in
November to end his silence about the way The Los Angeles Times was
being run. The management team headed by Mark H. Willes, a former
General Mills executive with no newspaper experience, had vowed to
``reinvent'' the newspaper, soar its circulation and raise the
price of the stock.
 &HT;    Willes came to the paper in 1995 as CEO; in '97, Willes
appointed himself publisher, a title he kept until 1999, when he
gave it to Kathryn M. Downing, the former head of the company's
legal-book publishing division. Downing likewise had no newspaper
experience.
 &HT;    Chandler says he kept silent about what was going on for so long
because he thought the new management deserved a chance. He
overlooked what he felt was its naivete and arrogance, especially
the talk of ``reinventing'' the paper.
 &HT;    But only after it was revealed that Willes and Downing had
approved a profit-sharing scheme with the owners of the Staples
Center, a new local sports arena, in which the advertising revenues
from a special edition of the paper's Sunday magazine about the
center would be shared with the subject of the stories, did he
decide that the integrity of his newspaper had been placed at risk.
 &HT;    ``When I saw the Staples thing come down, I just lost it,''
Chandler said. Chandler, who rarely grants interviews, says he had
been paying close attention to the Willes regime for some time _ to
the closing of Times-Mirror's New York Newsday and Baltimore
Evening Sun, as well as to cutbacks in staff and news space at The
Los Angeles Times.
 &HT;    ``I'd been looking at all these things, and I'd been saying, I'm
not going to criticize,'' Chandler said. ``We had just gone out and
hired this wonderful new CEO, and he's seen fit to hire a woman
publisher who's never been on a newspaper, but maybe she'll learn,
be quick on the job training, maybe they'll get their act
together.''
 &HT;    As long as the issues were merely financial, as long as the
prestige of the paper was not being seriously called into question,
Chandler kept quiet. But it was beginning to wear on him.
 &HT;    Then the Staples Center fiasco erupted. ``He has always cared
deeply about how The Los Angeles Times was regarded on the East
Coast,'' said David Shaw, the paper's Pulitzer-winning media
writer, who conducted an internal investigation of the Staples
incident, resulting in a 14-page special section. ``Once editorial
integrity was being questioned, he couldn't stay silent.''
 &HT;    ``It's been kind of cooking for quite a while,'' said Chandler's
sister, Mia Chandler Frost. ``He's been trying to bite his
tongue.''
 &HT;    Two weeks after the special Staples edition of the Sunday
magazine appeared, and a week after Downing told the staff she had
no intention of resigning, Chandler decided to act. He telephoned a
surprised Bill Boyarsky, the city editor.
 &HT;    He began to dictate, and Boyarsky transcribed. As the afternoon
progressed and copies of the statement were faxed back and forth
between Chandler and Boyarsky, word began to get around the
newsroom.
 &HT;    Michael Parks, the paper's top editor, and several other editors
asked Boyarsky not to read Chandler's statement aloud. But at 5:45,
a message went out to the entire staff.
 &HT;    ``Quite a crowd gathered,'' Boyarsky said. ``Most of them had
probably never seen him or certainly had never worked for him. But
they knew who he was and what he had done.''
 &HT;    Chandler's statement, Boyarsky said, signaled to them that
``they were fighting one of the great, great battles of modern
journalism.''
 &HT;    And although the statement was greeted with thunderous applause,
it stirred Downing to issue an ill-considered statement of her own
calling Chandler ``angry and bitter'' and lamenting that it was
``too bad when some people get old, they get bitter.''
 &HT;    To his detractors it was self-serving and came much too late.
But to his supporters it was invigorating proof that, despite his
long silence, Chandler was still there, still fighting the good
fight.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    ``I do look back on my life for certain lessons that I have
learned,'' said Otis Chandler, the man who was publisher of The Los
Angeles Times for 20 years, from 1960 to 1980.
 &HT;    ``I do look back with great appreciation for the kind of life
I've led, which has been fascinating. But I tend to live in the
moment and look forward to the future. So I don't sit in an office
surrounded by Los Angeles Times photos and memorabilia and Pulitzer
Prizes. No, I don't.''
 &HT;    Which makes it all the more surprising that Otis Chandler has
emerged, after a self-imposed silence of almost a decade, as
something of a latter-day hero to many newspaper journalists around
the country, a prophet lamenting in the wilderness.
 &HT;    For more than a quarter-century, beginning with his unexpected
rise at age 33 to the position of publisher of The Los Angeles
Times, which had been run by his father and grandfather and
great-grandfather before him, Chandler was a figure of the first
importance in the nation's second most important metropolis.
 &HT;    Late last year Chandler spoke out, chastising his successors at
The Los Angeles Times and charging that its bottom-line, Wall
Street-oriented management had compromised the reputation and
editorial integrity of his family's paper. His words echoed through
hundreds of newsrooms.
 &HT;    And they played against a backdrop of great change and anxiety
in the newspaper business, as increasing corporate ownership has
led to an era of cost-cutting and an obsession with stock prices.
 &HT;    During his 20 years as publisher Chandler was instrumental in
transforming The LA Times from a dreadful newspaper into one of the
two or three best in the country.
 &HT;    If his power came with a certain reputation for oddness _
fueled, perhaps, by a clear preference for outdoor derring-do over
the trappings of media mogulhood, as well as an assortment of
rich-guy hobbies like racing Porsches and hunting big game _ well,
that just made him more interesting, harder to categorize.
 &HT;    Then in 1980, he relinquished the job unexpectedly, though he
continued to serve for the next five years as chairman of the
parent company.
 &HT;    By the 1990s, his trips to Los Angeles were increasingly rare,
mostly to attend board meetings (he remained a director until 1998)
or to visit his celebrated but by then infirm mother, Dorothy
Buffum Chandler, who died in 1997.
 &HT;    Chandler hasn't been inside the Los Angeles Times building since
his final annual shareholder's meeting two years ago, and he says
he no longer feels welcome there. Many of the people in its

CLINTON AND BLAIR URGE ACCESS TO GENOME MAPPING RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Calling the effort to decode the human genome ``one of the most
significant scientific projects of all time,'' President Clinton
and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain issued a joint statement
Tuesday saying the genome data ``should be made freely available to
scientists everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders praised the academic researchers who are making
their genome data publicly available and said, ``We commend other
scientists around the world to adopt this policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement is a high-visibility endorsement of the policy
pursued by the public consortium of scientists decoding the
sequence of the three billion chemical units that comprise the
human genetic blueprint. The consortium is largely financed by the
U.S. National Institutes of Health and the Wellcome Trust of
London, a large medical charity.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium is competing intensely with its rival, the Celera
Corp. of Rockville, Md. Celera jumped into the race only in May
1998 and has already put itself in a position where it might be
able to claim victory. Both sides seem prepared to publish rival
`draft' sequences of the genome sometime this summer, with more
complete versions coming later.
</P>
<P>
   Celera and its president, Dr. J. Craig Venter, have long been in
competition with the leading scientists of the public consortium,
chiefly Dr. John Sulston of the Sanger Center in Britain and Dr.
Robert Waterston of Washington University in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Sparring between the two sides became so intense that in recent
merger talks between the two sides, now aborted, the public
consortium proposed as an article of agreement that ``The current
antagonism and excessive competition should be replaced with a more
collaborative spirt.''
</P>
<P>
   One matter of principle underlying the rivalry concerns public
access to the human genome data. Sulston and Waterston, together
with their financial backers, feel strongly that the human genome
should be made freely available to all researchers so as to speed
medical progress. They regularly place their new DNA sequences in
public data banks, and have urged Celera to do likewise.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative for the joint statement seems to have come from
the Wellcome Trust in London and to be aimed principally at Celera,
the consortium's rival. But Dr. Michael Dexter, director of the
Trust, said his concern was with overbroad patents being granted on
the genome sequence that might obstruct researchers' access.
</P>
<P>
   He said the raw sequence, the string of chemical units making up
the genome, was not patentable and that the Trust ``would fight any
patents based on sequence if they obstruct academic work and
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Venter has always said that Celera would make available a
consensus sequence of the human genome, a position he reiterated in
a statement Tuesday. Celera's business plan depends in part on
patenting new human genes it discovers and also on becoming a
principal holder of genomic information, charging fees for
companies to search and analyze its data base of human and other
genomes.
</P>
<P>
   Two other companies, Human Genome Sciences and Incyte, claim to
have captured much of the value of the human genome already through
a short-cut method that detects human genes.
</P>
<P>
   Only 3 percent of the DNA in the human genome encodes working
genes, the rest being largely useless filler material. Picking the
genes out is no trivial matter and the computer programs designed
to do so still work very inefficiently.
</P>
<P>
   But human cells can recognize the genes, and regularly make
transcripts of the genes whose information is required to make
proteins. These transcripts, known as messenger-RNAs, can be
captured and analyzed. Just a small portion of their sequence is
sufficient to identify the corresponding part of the gene from
which they come. These little snippets of genes, known as expressed
sequence tags or ESTs, are the basis of gene-searching approaches
used by Human Genome Sciences and Incyte.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Haseltine, president of Human Genome Sciences, said
Tuesday that his company had already identified 95 percent of the
human genes by the EST approach and had filed patents on 7,500
medically useful human genes. So far 2,500 of these patents have
been published, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Dexter and Dr. Rachel E. Levinson, a senior official at the
White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said the joint
statement issued Tuesday acknowledged intellectual property rights.

`ITALIAN FOOD ARTISANS': FOODS THAT SCORN THE EFFICIENCY EXPERT

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's partly an attractive guide to Italian ingredients and
partly a collection of thumbnail biographies of the people who
produce them. But most of all, ``Italian Food Artisans'' by Pamela
Sheldon Johns (Chronicle Books, $24.95) provides behind-the-scenes
descriptions with alluring photographs to show how more than a
dozen traditional Italian foods are made.
</P>
<P>
   The author also outlines the qualities that set those foods
apart from their commonplace industrial versions.
</P>
<P>
   She writes, for example, of a fourth-generation company in
central Italy, Rustichella d'Abruzzo, which makes dry pasta with
handcrafted bronze molds, resulting in pasta with a roughened
texture that makes sauce cling invitingly to it. Unlike commercial
pasta, which is usually dried at high temperatures for about 12
hours, this pasta is slowly air-dried for more than four days,
which maintains the flavor of the wheat.
</P>
<P>
   Hand-made details and the time to do things right _ both of
which are costly and avoided by big companies _ are lavished on
many of the products described in the book, including deeply
flavorful cured meats, fine balsamic vinegar, rustic caciocavallo
cheese and fruity estate-bottled extra virgin olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   Reading about culatello, a type of prosciutto that is adored by
connoisseurs but is not yet imported into the United States, I
wanted to book a trip to Parma.
</P>
<P>
   In a chapter about fresh truffles, Johns explains not only the
white ones, for which Italy is famous, but also the black variety,
which is gathered in Umbria. She gives advice about using truffles
and how to select truffle oils and pastes.
</P>
<P>
   The author, who works for the Avignonesi winery in Montepulciano
and who conducts culinary tours of Italy, pairs faces with the
foods.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Antonino Caravaglio from Salina, an Aeolian island
off Sicily, gathers and preserves capers in a fresh sea salt. The
capers contribute their salty tang to a lemon-dressed seafood
salad, to a spicy all-purpose red sauce, which takes minutes to
make, and to a luscious peperonata mixture of onions, bell peppers
and tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Those are some of the mostly simple, regional recipes the author
gives for each of the foods. There are even restaurant recipes,
like one for the pasta Laura Galli makes at her Osteria Giusti in
Modena.
</P>
<P>
   Wedges of pizza rustica made with an olive oil crust and a
cheese and salami filling were delicious warm from the oven with a
glass of white wine. But an orange-scented olive oil cake was a bit
greasy and heavy, better the day after it was baked and even better
made with only one cup of oil and one cup of milk, instead of a cup
and a half of each.
</P>
<P>
   Johns understands the marketplace and appreciates that consumers
have come to depend on products, like commercial balsamic vinegar,
that are not made in traditional fashion. She gives the appropriate
uses for supermarket balsamic, in cooking and salad dressings, and
offers a tip on how to judge it: avoid brands that list additives.
</P>
<P>
   She also recognizes that there are other foods, including
prosciutto di Parma, that have become somewhat industrialized
without sacrificing high standards.
</P>
<P>
   This useful book also lists salamis and cheeses by region and
has a buying guide to food products in Italy and the United
States. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A few years ago, when we were new to this city, we
were desperate for raw peanuts to boil and eat as a snack as we did
growing up in South Carolina. But they seemed as scarce here as
fresh bagels in Beaufort. Fried's, the dried-fruit and nut dealer
next door to our Ludlow Street tenement, had hundreds of pounds of
peanuts _ all roasted. ``Try Hunts Point,'' the counterman advised,
then added, ``Wear your work boots.''
</P>
<P>
   We were dubious _ go shopping at the city's produce terminal? _
but we picked a wholesaler from the Yellow Pages and called anyway.
``Peanuts? Not us,'' he said. ``Try Armata.'' The clerk who
answered at E. Armata Inc. said the first fresh peanuts of the
season had just arrived from South Florida. And he encouraged us to
come up and buy: ``Get a pass at the gate and find us at Building
A. Anytime after 4 a.m.''
</P>
<P>
   And that was how we discovered the giant wholesale produce
market in the South Bronx _ the source of the palest endive,
wrapped in tissue; the most tender baby artichokes on their way to
a date with Jean-Georges Vongerichten; and clusters of moist green
peanuts, still perfumed with the rich earth they had left in the
Everglades the night before.
</P>
<P>
   The Hunts Point Terminal Market _ a razor-fenced thunder dome of
musclemen and machinery _ is the way station for the bulk of the
fresh vegetables and fruits offered in the city's restaurants and
greengrocers. But it is not solely the domain of professional
buyers. Although the public is officially discouraged from shopping
there, persistent souls are tolerated if they go prepared, and the
thrill of a bargain is enhanced by the awe of being at a crossroads
of world commerce, like Times Square or the floor of the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Hunts Point generates $1.5 billion in sales a year, according to
Myra Gordon, the executive director. It is the world's largest
wholesale produce market in volume, although its size, 125 acres,
is a fraction of Rungis in Paris or La Merced in Mexico City. And
it is likely to grow: in April, the city is expected to recommend
that the Fulton Fish Market in Manhattan move to a site beside it.
</P>
<P>
   Hunts Point could not be more different from the farm stands
where we bought raw peanuts down South, or even from the Fulton
Market, with its postcard-worthy paving stones and 18th-century
facades.
</P>
<P>
   Hunts Point looks startlingly like a prison, set among the scrap
metal yards and abandoned warehouses. A 14-foot-tall sheet-metal
fence topped by coils of razor wire stretches to the horizon. A
guard stationed at the gate sells day passes for $2. (We shouldn't
have been surprised: Hunts Point has long had a rough reputation,
and in February, seven federal food inspectors pleaded guilty to
taking bribes in a kickback scheme that allowed some wholesalers to
cheat the growers who supplied them.)
</P>
<P>
   Inside the gate, it is a dreary arena of asphalt, boxcars and
tractor-trailers. It is hard to imagine this desolate setting as
the source of the bunch of spinach at the corner greengrocer, the
basil in the marinara at a neighborhood trattoria, the rhubarb in a
four-star tart. And yet each of those items spends quality time in
a refrigerated storeroom at one of the market's 59 wholesalers.
</P>
<P>
   On that first visit, navigating among the four huge buildings,
each as long as a freight train, we made our way to Armata, past
forklifts loaded head-high with crates swooping in and out of
curtained doorways, teetering and honking in an endless loop of
narrow misses. Thousand-pound pallets of onions crashed to the
concrete docks as buyers, seemingly oblivious of the clangor,
inspected the produce stacked outside each storeroom. The
cold-weather uniform here is hooded sweatshirts, quilted jackets
and insulated coveralls. Work boots, it turned out, are necessary _
to tread the sludge of pulverized produce and brake fluid
underfoot.
</P>
<P>
   Even before we saw Armata's sign, we spotted an open bushel of
peanuts nestled between a crate of bright-orange Israeli persimmons
and a hundred-pound burlap bag of Idaho potatoes. The salesman was
efficient, neither brusque nor polite. We inquired about a bag. He
nodded, barked a command to an unseen employee, made a stroke of a
pen on a form and passed it to the cashier. We handed over $32
(cash, of course). The salesman was already on to the next buyer, a
Korean grocer, when the dock hand emerged from the storeroom with
our 50-pound bag of peanuts slung over his shoulder. We returned to
the car with an almost illicit glee. We'd cheated both geography
and commerce, and scored a taste of home for less per pound than we
would have spent at a South Carolina farm stand.
</P>
<P>
   We have since found other, admittedly more expensive, sources
for fresh peanuts in Chinatown, but we still shop Hunts Point.
Buying in bulk makes sense when something is prohibitively
expensive or when we're canning and preserving (pickled peaches are
among our favorites in fall) or cooking for a throng (we served
pina coladas in coconuts from a $15 sack of 40 from the Dominican
Republic).
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, we were cooking with sour orange juice. The case
we got for $11.50 at the wholesale market weighed more than 20
pounds. At Dean &AMP; DeLuca, sour oranges are $3 a pound, more than
five times as much.
</P>
<P>
   The market's Internet site
(www.terminalmarkets.com/huntspoint.htm) includes Agriculture
Department reports on the going prices at Hunts Point. We always
check it before setting out, to determine whether it's worth the
trip. This week, for example, the page will tell you that a bushel
bucket of Texas savoy spinach will cost about $11, and 12 six-ounce
containers of California red raspberries are around $18.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   As intrepid as we feel, we're not the only ``civilians''
shopping at Hunts Point. Purveyors told us about cooperatives of
three or four families who alternate trips to the market. And then
there was the brave woman we saw on two recent visits, cruising the
docks on a bicycle with a basket modified to carry a single crate.
</P>
<P>
   The chaos we encountered on our first visit was actually the end
of the working day _ the lull, we learned on subsequent forays. The
market is open for business constantly from midday Sunday until
Friday afternoon; an intricate choreography of delivery and pickup
allows roughly 300,000 pounds of produce to move in and out each
day.
</P>
<P>
   Produce arrives at Hunts Point from all over North America by
truck and is flown in from more than 50 countries like New Zealand,
Chile and the Netherlands. Though it was conceived to serve the New
York area, Hunts Point buyers distribute its produce as far as the
Canadian border, Florida, Chicago and Barbados.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday mornings, before the market opens, refrigerated
tractor-trailers pull into the compound from places as far off as
Nogales, Ariz. (a transfer point for Mexican produce), and as near
as Kennedy Airport, delivering loads of Sonoran cucumbers and
blueberries just landed from Argentina. Those trucks depart by 6
p.m. to make way for boxcars full of durable vegetables like
onions, carrots, potatoes and broccoli _ what the trade calls
hardware. Around 10 p.m., the trucks of buyers for restaurants,
schools, hotels and other commercial enterprises swarm in and keep
the market bustling well beyond 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, the market's director, said 1,500 to 1,800 independent
greengrocers shop at the market. But there are few chefs wandering
the docks. Nearly all restaurants pay purveyors to prowl the market
and deliver the goods to the backdoor. (Supermarket chains like A&AMP;P
and Key Food are supplied by their own warehouses.)
</P>
<P>
   The New York produce market dates from the 17th century, when
pushcarts in Lower Manhattan sold vegetables, meats, eggs and milk
from local farms. In 1812, the city centralized the market at
Washington, Fulton and Vesey Streets to ease the congestion on
downtown streets. Washington Market expanded through the early 20th
century, taking on more and more vendors, until the city
established the current market in 1967, exclusively for fruits and
vegetables, on a marshy site near the confluence of the Bronx and
East Rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Several wholesalers at Hunts Point, like Rosenthal &AMP; Klein and
D'Arrigo Brothers, trace their roots to the Washington Market era,
when vendors specialized in a particular category of produce _
citrus, say, or leafy greens.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew and Stephen D'Arrigo, the patriarchs and founders of
D'Arrigo Brothers, emigrated from Messina, Italy, and in 1923 began
their empire by persuading farmers in California to cultivate the
broccoli, rape, fennel and cactus pears that they and other
Italian-Americans missed from the old country. The company now
carries a wide range of produce, from raspberries to purple
potatoes, but it is still known as a big mover of broccoli and
fennel.
</P>
<P>
   While the produce on display may appear remarkably similar from
vendor to vendor, there is enormous variability beneath the skin.
``The display doesn't mean a thing,'' cautions Joe Holtz, the
general manager of the Park Slope Food Co-op.
</P>
<P>
   He advises a ``taste first, buy later'' approach. And we noticed
that experienced buyers _ the ones who have rapport, and an
account, with a wholesaler _ will breeze past the displays to the
storerooms, clambering atop pallets of peppers to do spot tastings.
Occasional buyers, like us, would be hustled out of any storeroom
they dared to enter uninvited. In the wholesale world, customer
service is a courtesy, not an entitlement.
</P>
<P>
   We learned that quickly enough on that first trip. It took both
of us to wrestle that enormous yellow sack of peanuts across the
bustling dock and into the back seat of our car. The sun was just
rising over Queens as we crossed the Third Avenue bridge back into
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Outside our apartment building, we hoisted the 50-pound trophy
up onto the hood of our car and posed for a celebratory snapshot.
Minutes later, the peanuts were boiling and our tiny tenement was
filling with the beany, briny aroma of a South Carolina kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   After a morning of chaos and discovery, we had come home.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Even for shoppers hardened to the pre-Thanksgiving
rush at Fairway, the frenzied docks at Hunts Point present a
challenge. Here's how to navigate a trip:
</P>
<P>
   Getting There
</P>
<P>
   The Hunts Point Terminal Market, also called the New York City
Terminal Market, occupies 125 acres off Halleck Street in the South
Bronx. It's open from 10 p.m. Sunday until 5 p.m. Friday. The best
time to visit is 6 to 11 a.m., after most commercial brokers have
made their purchases and activity has calmed down.
</P>
<P>
   Those who are determined to take public transit can catch the
No. 6 train to the Hunts Point Avenue stop, and transfer to the Bx6
bus for a short ride to a stop near the pedestrian entrance. But
since you must buy by the case, a vehicle of some sort is almost a
necessity. (And don't plan to fill shopping bags.)
</P>
<P>
   By car, follow the signs for Exit 1, Hunts Point Market, off the
Major Deegan Expressway. Drive beneath the Bruckner Expressway on
Bruckner Boulevard, following the signs to the market.
</P>
<P>
   Those without a market ID card must buy a $2 day pass and pay $1
to park a car. Parking spaces are always scarce. The most likely
area to find a spot is at the southern end, opposite the entrance,
in the lot outside Mike's Restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Preparing for the Trip
</P>
<P>
   You will have to tell the tollbooth guard the name of a
wholesaler you plan to visit; wholesalers are listed, with phone
numbers and locations, on a map of the market at
www.terminalmarkets.com/huntspoint.htm. You can print out the map
to take along. Vendors also offer online information like the
produce in stock.
</P>
<P>
   The proper attire is the same as for gardening or tuning up a
car. And you should have some smaller bills so you can pay exact
prices.
</P>
<P>
   At the Market
</P>
<P>
   Hunts Point comprises four buildings, each about three crosstown
blocks long, with a loading dock running the length of each
building. Along the dock, the wholesalers are virtually
indistinguishable from one another, marked only by a name on a
shingle _ another reason to take the map.
</P>
<P>
   Mike's Restaurant, really a diner, and Chosen Variety, the
adjoining store, are the closest things to amenities. Mike's serves
decent, hearty, short-order grill food. Chosen Variety sells
foul-weather gear, Hunts Point T-shirts, Statue of Liberty key
chains and _ if you just can't wait to cut into your freshly bought
Anjou pears _ jackknives.

ONCE-SECRET CHINA TRADE PACT IS UNVEILED IN EXQUISITE DETAIL
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Will be updated.)

 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Raw fur skins of mink, whole, with or without head,
tail or paws. Monolithic digital integrated circuits obtained by
MOS technology. Pure-bred asses, mules and hinnies.
</P>
<P>
   These are the turn-of-the-millennium equivalents of
throw-weights and hard-target killers, the substance of diplomatic
progress between world superpowers. These days, when the United
States and China take confidence-building measures, they deal in
provisionally preserved capers, not submarine-based missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, responding to congressional
pressure, Tuesday declassified and released a 250-page document,
entitled ``Agreement on Market Access Between the People's Republic
of China and the United States of America.'' Both sides have hailed
the agreement, signed last November, as their greatest diplomatic
breakthrough since they re-established economic ties in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   But if the agreement redefines relations between the world's
most powerful country and its most populous one, it does so without
much diplomatic wordplay or soaring verbiage. In fact, there are no
more than a handful of passages that include full English
sentences. It is less a treaty than a spreadsheet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm impressed by how incredibly boring it is,'' said a trade
adviser to Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont. The adviser is almost certainly
one of the few people outside of the U.S. Trade Representative's
office to peruse the eye-straining micro-print, which, until
Tuesday, had been distributed only to those with security
clearances. But, he added, the importance of the accord is how
little it leaves to the imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the United States has ever negotiated a trade
agreement with this kind of specificity,'' he said. ``It wipes out
all the ambiguity.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, for all the fine print, the agreement is a blueprint
for commercial relations between China and the United States well
into the 21st century. It charts how many films foreign producers
can show in Chinese movie theaters (20), when foreign banks can
start dealing in Chinese currency (two years after China joins the
WTO), and how much equity foreign telecommunications companies can
hold in Chinese mobile phone services (49 percent). More generally,
it enshrines in print China's commitment to allow capitalism to
spread to nearly every region and into nearly every kind of
economic activity, including many previously left up to the whim of
Chinese bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has called the agreement a cornerstone of
bilateral relations. But he faces perhaps his last big legislative
battle to get Congress to agree to one aspect of it: granting China
permanent normal trade status in return for its commitment to join
the Geneva-based trade organization on the terms negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   Congress must decide whether to sacrifice its annual review of
China's trade status, in effect pledge to guarantee the Communist
country the same trading rights in the United States that most
other nations have. A diverse coalition of Republican and
Democrats, many of them concerned about human rights abuses and
China's threat to use force against neighboring Taiwan, would like
to deny China permanent normal trade status.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials have said the vote, which they
hope will take place by Memorial Day, too close to call.

  (Denis Hennequin heads McDonald's France, whose 791 ``McDo''
restaurants have come under attack as an erosion of French culinary
tradition and a threat to French agriculture.) 
(DW) 
 By DENIS HENNEQUIN with VIVIENNE WALT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   My grandmother was shocked when I went to work for McDonald's.
She thought I was cooking fries on Boulevard St.-Michel. It was
1984. McDonald's had 17 restaurants in France. Its headquarters was
in an apartment. But I thought if I wanted to get ahead, I should
join an American company. It would take me forever to run a French
company: I'd have to know all the right people.
</P>
<P>
   I was 39 when I became McDonald's president two years ago _
very, very unusual for France. When I was invited to the World Cup,
I sat in the box with French executives. I think they thought I was
there to serve the drinks. Then one asked: ``Is your chauffeur
waiting for you outside?'' I said: ``No, I have my subway ticket in
my pocket.'' He couldn't believe it.
</P>
<P>
   I grew up in the Latin Quarter, the best place to be. I feel
like a refugee living on the Right Bank. I was 10 in 1968, during
the student revolt in Paris. I stood for hours on the balcony with
my ski goggles and a handkerchief to protect myself from the tear
gas, watching the students fight the police.
</P>
<P>
   You have to be a rebel sometime in your life. I think the young
French today aren't rebels. They are too worried about getting a
job.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, in my last year of high school, my friends and I
started this little magazine called Asbury Sound, after
Springsteen, of course. We typed all the articles and Xeroxed a few
copies at a shop. Then we got invited on a television show to talk
about our magazine, and we had so many requests for subscriptions
we couldn't handle it. So we just shut the whole thing down!
</P>
<P>
   Later, in 1981, I had a weekly radio show talking about jazz.
Thank God I didn't keep the tapes; it wasn't very good.
</P>
<P>
   From the age of 16, I had jobs. One summer, I worked for a
bookstore, and the manager said, ``If you have nothing to do, look
busy.'' So for hours we'd take all the books off the shelves and
put them all back again.
</P>
<P>
   I'm a real Paris boy. I couldn't live without the action of the
city. The greatest activity in the world is to sit outside a cafe
and watch the world go by. But every now and then, I just have to
get out. So we drive six hours west to this island off Brittany,
called Behat, where there are no cars.
</P>
<P>
   We have three children, a boy and two girls, and the cat,
Josephine. Not after Napoleon's Josephine, not at all! It's after a
French rock song. On Sundays I go Rollerblading with the kids.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing I miss in my job is doing something physical,
manual. So I fix the house. Actually, I am pretty bad at it.
</P>
<P>
   The protests against McDonald's? I really felt like a scapegoat.
The worst moment was when they tore down the restaurant. I ask:
What have the French been eating for three centuries? Steak frites!
Meat and potatoes, like McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   You know why McDonald's is such a success here? Try taking your
kids to a French cafe. There's cigarette smoke, and alcohol. And
there's nothing kids hate more than sitting for hours over a meal.
Adults always tell me: ``I go to McDonald's but only with the
grandchildren.'' But it's not true. Secretly, they go.
</P>
<P>
   I tell my employees: if you're bored, change jobs. The day I get
bored with this, I'll leave. You know, maybe I'll start a rock
label or something.

`COTTON MARY': ACHING TO BE LADY OF THE HOUSE IN TWO CULTURES 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By ELVIS MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Cotton Mary'' features the Merchant Ivory team's infamous
undercurrent of understated emotion, feelings so modestly rendered
that sometimes one is unsure if there is any emotion. It was
directed by Ismail Merchant, who is generally the producing half of
the team.
</P>
<P>
   Set in India in 1954, the story begins with a pair of nurses
strolling. Mary (Madhur Jaffrey) is talking with her young friend
Rosie (Sakina Jaffrey) about her dream. (The actors are mother and
daughter in real life.) Mary, a dark-skinned Indian with an English
father and an Indian mother, is foolishly proud of her European
heritage. She tells Rosie that she dreamed she had a white baby.
The trouble, such as it is, begins with that subconscious need to
fit in. But from the confident roll of Rosie's hips it's easy to
tell there are probably lots of different kinds of trouble to come
in this forlorn melodrama, which is low on drama and high on
mellow.
</P>
<P>
   Mary helps a hugely pregnant British woman, Lily MacIntosh
(Greta Scacchi), deliver her child. After the birth Lily is unable
to nurse her baby and Mary sneaks the infant to her handicapped
sister, Blossom (Neena Gupta), a wet nurse who feeds it. Mary takes
credit for the child care and insinuates her way into the MacIntosh
household. There she slowly takes over Lily's home, forcing out the
beloved family butler, Abraham (Prayag Raaj), and playing on the
new mother's guilt over being unable to nurse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cotton Mary'' has more obvious symbolism than a high school
musical production of ``Lord of the Flies.'' (The title refers to
Mary's nickname, which came about because of her preference for
British cotton over Indian cotton.) Poor Lily's inability to
produce milk for her child is so blatant a metaphor for England's
dying maternalism that it's no wonder the bags under Scacchi's eyes
seem to hang down to her waist; she is shouldering a great deal of
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Muted and mindful, the film is a high-tea version of ``Imitation
of Life,'' in which the woman who desperately wants to pass is
driven mad by her desire to be a grand white lady. In this case,
however, Mary seems to be going goofy because she has access to a
broad-brimmed straw hat; she takes to dressing as the lady of the
house.
</P>
<P>
   Jaffrey's performance as Mary gets wilder and wilder, as though
she were trying to compensate for the film's air of mild gloom,
which never erupts into the surge of near-camp that is a tradition
of melodrama. We have to settle for scenes in which Lily's
patronizing club friends cluck and shake their heads over Mary's
presumptuousness: cliches that at least tell us where we are.
</P>
<P>
   Evenhandedness often hangs over Merchant Ivory productions like
a late spring thunderstorm, where at least one gets to revel in the
humidity. In ``Heat and Dust'' (1982) the young and paralyzingly
vivid Scacchi provided that dampness, a voluptuous overspill that
heightened the proceedings. There are elements of bigger drama in
``Cotton Mary,'' like the lustful entrances of Lily's husband, John
(James Wilby), a swaggering journalist who looks so hungry you're
almost afraid he is going to turn and wink at the camera. John gets
to show some vitality, and Rosie's saucy walk is a bright green
light to him.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctimonious without being contemptuous, ``Cotton Mary'' is
almost maddeningly indifferent: Tennessee Williams without the
gleeful insanity. It is so unfocused that it is one of those rare
films that cries out for a narrator _ maybe Lily's daughter (Laura
Lumley), who's the clearest-eyed _ to clarify things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cotton Mary'' is terminally marred by good taste; and
melodrama is like the Star-Kist commercial: people don't want tuna
with good taste; they want tuna that tastes good.
</P>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The largest mass mailing in the nation's history is
underway.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next week, the U.S. Postal Service will delivery almost
100 million Census 2000 questionnaires to households across the
country, Census Bureau Director Kenneth Prewitt announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   At stake in the census is the allocation of billions of dollars
in federal and state aid, as well as representation in Congress and
state and local governments. In addition, countless private
organizations base decisions on census data.
</P>
<P>
   ``The census is now in the hands of the American people,''
Prewitt told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Census officials want people to send back the questionnaires as
soon as they receive them. Reminder postcards will be sent to all
homes in a few weeks, and census workers will visit those who don't
return forms through the spring and early summer. ``We want to make
sure everybody is recognized,'' Prewitt said. ``Returning your
census form is one of the most important civic duties you'll do
over the next 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The director said only 2 percent of the census forms have been
returned, but that he expected between 50 and 60 million to arrive
at the Census Bureau within the next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a busy time around here,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt said the bureau is hoping it can slow a decades-old
decline in the proportion of people who take the time to fill out
their census forms and mail them back. In 1990, 65 percent of
American households that received the form completed and returned
it, down from the 78 percent that did so in 1970. This year, the
bureau is planning on a 61 percent return rate. In particular, he
said, the bureau will attempt to encourage groups that are
historically undercounted to participate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a problem that has vexed the Census Bureau for the
last 50 years,'' Prewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990 count _ which the Census Bureau says undercounted the
American population by more than 4 million _ was the first judged
to be less accurate than the preceding tally.Prewitt said census
officials have expressed concern over the accuracy of this year's
count since many of the factors that made the population hard to
count last time around have only gotten worse. The population is
larger, more mobile and more diverse than ever. Public apathy and
concerns over privacy also jeopardize the census tally. Prewitt
said that about half a million census takers will be dispatched to
interview the roughly 40 percent of households that do not return
the forms. Census statisticians will then tabulate the results for
months. The operation _ the largest peacetime mobilization effort
in U.S. history _ will send census takers to impoverished villages
on the Mexican border, to islands off Maine and to shanties erected
by homeless people in the nation's large cities. The importance of
counting everyone, Prewitt said, stems from the fact the census is
used to fix the number of House seats for each state, and that
states use the number to draw legislative districts. In addition,
billions of dollars in federal aid will be distributed on the basis
of how the population is counted.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't fill out the form, you lose out on money and
representation,'' he said, adding that an equitable distribution of
resources has been difficult because minorities, children and the
urban poor are missed at disproportionate levels in the census.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage these people to send in their forms, the Census
Bureau has spent more than $80 million on an advertising campaign _
the largest ever for a census _ aimed at members of minority
groups, people who rent and those living in mobile homes who tend
not to return their census forms. The bureau will spend another $20
million over the next six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of Young &AMP; Rubicam, the New York City advertising
firm that is handling the campaign, estimates that many
African-Americans will see the census commercials as many as 120
times, and that some Hispanics could see them as many 105 times by
the end of April. The bureau is also working with local governments
and community groups in an effort to convince people to return the
forms. This years' census is by far the most expensive in the
nation's history, even taking inflation into account. So far, the
cost of the 2000 census is estimated at $6.8 billion, a huge
increase over the $2.6 billion spent in 1990.The Census Bureau
cites higher marketing costs and over-all inflation for the steeply
higher costs this year.

AUSTRALIAN WILL LEAD ROYAL BALLET 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Ross Stretton, director of the Australian Ballet, has
been chosen to become director of the Royal Ballet next year, it
was announced Tuesday. He will be the first non-Briton to hold the
post.
</P>
<P>
   Stretton, a 48-year-old Australian, will succeed Sir Anthony
Dowell, 57. Dowell said in June that he would step down in August
2001, after the company completes its first two seasons in the
richly reconstructed Royal Opera House in Covent Garden. The opera
house reopened in December after a three-year $360 million rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   Dowell took over as director in 1986, assuming the post first
held by Dame Ninette de Valois after she founded the company in
1931 and subsequently by such major figures in British dance as Sir
Frederick Ashton and Sir Kenneth MacMillan.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has been a principal dancer and artistic
administrator with companies in Melbourne and New York _ he was a
star at the American Ballet Theater for years _ Stretton comes to
the job a virtual unknown in London, with little of the
identification with the British dance traditions that his
predecessors created and that the Royal Ballet has long enshrined.
</P>
<P>
   Currently on national tour in Australia, Stretton is not due in
London until next week, but the Royal Ballet released a statement
of his aims Tuesday in which he promised to ``reinvigorate the
classical heritage and to develop the art form further.''
</P>
<P>
   He has been credited with reviving the fortunes of the
Australian Ballet since he became its artistic leader three years
ago by tidying up the company's style and cleaning up its classical
look. On the company's visit to New York last October, Anna
Kisselgoff, chief dance critic of The New York Times, called the
Australian Ballet ``virtually a company reborn,'' saying that
Stretton's leadership had produced ``terrific dancing, creativity
and a new ensemble spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   She found in his Australian dancers ``a greater classical
purity, especially impressive in the perfect body placement that
recalls his own noble style as a dancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Stretton's arrival in London will reunite him with Michael
Kaiser, an American who is the executive director of the Royal
Opera House and who held the same post at Ballet Theater, where
Stretton was assistant director to the artistic director, Kevin
McKenzie. McKenzie had been widely seen as a front-runner for the
job here but decided to remain in his current post in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In the months after Dowell's announcement, speculation brought
forth the names of Mikhail Baryshnikov and Twyla Tharp, the Royal
Ballet stars Sylvie Guillem and Irek Mukhamedov and a longtime
Royal Ballet choreographer, Ashley Page. The two leading British
candidates were said to be David Bintley, whom press reports quoted
as saying that he preferred keeping his current job in England as
head of the Birmingham Royal Ballet, and Ross MacGibbon, a former
principal dancer at Covent Garden who is a television director and
producer and a member of the Royal Opera House board.
</P>
<P>
   Stretton was born in Canberra and trained at the Australian
Ballet School. He became a principal artist with the Australian
Ballet before moving to New York in 1979 to join the Joffrey.
Baryshnikov invited him to dance as a guest artist with Ballet
Theater during the 1980-81 season and then asked him to become a
permanent member.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to dancing with Ballet Theater, he toured with
``Baryshnikov and Company.'' and performed as a guest artist with
many companies in the United States and abroad. He moved into dance
administration at Ballet Theater in 1990, becoming assistant
director in 1993. He went to Melbourne to take up his current post
in January 1997.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Royal Ballet has major crowd pleasers in dancers like Darcey
Bussell, Sarah Wildor, Deborah Bull, Adam Cooper, Guillem and
Carlos Acosta, a Cuban who joined last year. It ranks high on the
list of the world's top companies, which also includes the New York
City Ballet, Ballet Theater, the Paris Opera Ballet, the Kirov and
the Bolshoi.
</P>
<P>
   If there is an extra bounce in the British company's step these
days, it comes from relief that three years of having no permanent
home are over and that the new version of the house they have
performed in since 1946 is so much more accommodating to dance than
it was.
</P>
<P>
   In the reconstruction, the orchestra seating area was raked in
an effort to provide better sightlines for ballet viewers. The
company's 85 dancers will no longer have to rehearse and train in
three dimly lit rooms across town in West London: the new complex
includes five bright rehearsal studios, vastly improved backstage
conditions and physiotherapy and body conditioning suites.
</P>
<P>
   The house has reopened with programming that appears to go out
of its way to honor its past directors. Its production of Coppelia
is the one done by Ninette de Valois in 1954; it was last staged
here in 1970. And there are two three-ballet productions, ``The
MacMillan Inheritance'' and ``Ashton Revisited.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ashton trio includes the legendary ``Marguerite and
Armand,'' which opens Wednesday night with Sylvie Guillem and the
Paris Opera Ballet's Nicholas Le Riche in the roles created in 1963
as vehicles for Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev and never danced
by anyone else since.

FREE WILLIE: NOBODY TELLS MUSIC LEGEND WILLIE NELSON WHAT TO DO  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
(Attn: Tenn., Texas)  By BILL DeYOUNG   
 The Gainesville (Fla.) Sun   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since 1971, when he said goodbye to Nashville forever and went
home to his native Texas, Willie Nelson has had things pretty much
his way.
</P>
<P>
   He'd worn a suit and slicked-back hair for a decade, making
cookie-cutter country records that never hit. He hated it all _
suit, haircut and records _ so when he started working again, he
made it a point to look different and sound different. If Nashville
didn't like his attitude adjustment, well, there was always club
work around Austin, where the hippies loved him and believed him a
kindred spirit.
</P>
<P>
   The rest, of course, is history. Nelson was right, Nashville was
wrong. Today he is considered one of country's all-time greats. He
has recorded Western Swing, blues, jazz, reggae, salsa and
standards as well as quote-unquote traditional country music. He is
a revered songwriter, a movie star and a spokesman for farmers'
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all Nelson has played 200 one-nighters every year
with virtually the same band. They may not be the same musicians on
all his records _ Nelson has collaborated with everyone from Frank
Sinatra to Carlos Santana _ but they're always behind him on stage.
It's called Willie Nelson and Family because that's what they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Telepathy's a good word for it,'' Nelson, 66, says in a
telephone interview. ``We've played together so long that these
guys just kind of read my mind. They know what I'm gonna do _
whenever I hit the first note, they know what to do. I never have
to turn around and say we're gonna do this or that.''
</P>
<P>
   Guitarist Jody Payne and bassist Bee Spears joined the band 30
years ago, around the time Willie started reading Eastern
philosophy and let his red hair and beard grow out.
</P>
<P>
   Bobbie Nelson, Willie's younger sister, plays piano in the band,
in an old-time church style.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gospel piano,'' Nelson explains. ``It's home, it's where
I grew up. It's what I did growing up _ her and I played music
together all the time, in church, at home and school. And so I
really love the way she plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson's drummer, Paul English, has been by his side since 1965,
when he filled in for a missing drummer on a radio show in Fort
Worth. English was the inspiration for one of Nelson's best
post-Nashville songs. ``Me and Paul,'' he says, is a true story.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really got drunk in Buffalo, N.Y., at a show,'' Nelson
says. ``They had us closing it behind Charley Pride, and it was a
long show. I think Paul went out and got a No Parking sign and set
it up behind Kitty Wells on her show. It was one of those nights.''
Their carousing days are more or less behind them now.
</P>
<P>
   English's son Billy is the Family's percussionist. Just added is
Texas jazz guitar legend Jackie King, who made a duet album with
Nelson, ``Angel Eyes,'' nearly 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The band is as adept at the tricky time signatures of
``Stardust'' as it is with the tub-thumping ``Whiskey River.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's gotten better and better and better,'' Nelson
says of his band. ``We've always had real good musicians, but
there's been times when I thought the sound was a little too
cluttered, or a little this, a little that. But I think now it's
sounding as good, or better, than it ever sounded.''
</P>
<P>
   The Family backed Nelson on ``Night and Day,'' the
all-instrumental album he released last year. It was nominated for
a Grammy, as was Nelson's collaboration with Asleep at the Wheel
and Manhattan Transfer on the song ``Going Away Party.'' Neither
won, but Nelson himself was given a Lifetime Achievement Grammy.
</P>
<P>
   He is a member of the Country Music Hall of Fame and was one of
the recipients of the 1999 Kennedy Center Honors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Creative control'' has been an important phrase in every
record contract he's signed since he left Nashville. He doesn't
make concessions to garner radio play; they don't play him any
more, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   So he records what he wants. In the last six years, he's put out
an acoustic album (``Spirit''), an album with lush string
arrangements of popular songs (``Healing Hands of Time''), a Texas
dance-band album (``Just One Love''), a quirky, rhythmic effort
with Daniel Lanois and Emmylou Harris (``Teatro'') and the
instrumental set.
</P>
<P>
   Out in June, he says, will be ``Milk Cow Blues,'' a blues
recording featuring B.B. King, Keb Mo, Kenny Wayne Shepard and
others. He's halfway through another jazz album with his old buddy,
guitarist Paul Buskirk.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, there are movies to make (he was last seen in
``Wag the Dog'') and endless rounds of golf to be played, which
after music, is his purest passion.
</P>
<P>
   The only person Nelson has to answer to is Annie, his fourth
wife, who takes care of things back at the Texas ranch. They have
two sons, ages 10 and 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been together over 10 years now, and it seems to be
working out OK,'' Nelson shrugs. ``But it takes a really special
kind of thinking, and a special kind of person, to live with
somebody like me.''

   BALD-PRESIDENT _ On March 1, George W. Bush was cornered. David
Letterman was razzing him about international politics.
Specifically, about how the Republican presidential candidate
didn't know the leaders of some foreign countries. The punch line?
He asked Bush if he knew the name of the president of the Hair Club
for Men. Bush's response: ``You're not talking about ... Sy
Sperling, are you?'' While the audience laughed in New York,
Sperling almost fell off his treadmill in his Hillsboro Beach home.
``I flipped out. I couldn't believe it,'' Sperling says. ``I mean,
I know people know who I am, but this was
</P>
<P>
   amazing. I guess advertising works!'' But Sperling started
thinking about Bush's response. He started thinking about hair not
an uncommon thing to do, in his business. He made a connection, and
got the word out to The Media. ``There just may be a direct link
between having hair and becoming president,'' says an urgently
faxed press release from Hair Club for Men. ``It's a formula: The
candidate with most hair wins.... It's been documented that since
the dawn of the television age, every elected president since
Kennedy, and including Kennedy, has had hair.'' (Hutchins, Palm

BUSH SHOULDN'T ATTEMPT TO PLAY MCCAIN'S GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT ROBB  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Conventional wisdom has it that George W. Bush now
needs to make peace with John McCain to bring him on board.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that there are far more dangers to Bush from
caving in to McCain on campaign finance reform than there are
benefits from adding what will be, in the best of circumstances, a
highly unenthusiastic supporter.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear what McCain is up to. He suspended his campaign; he
did not end it. He wished George W. Bush well; he did not say he
will support Bush for president.
</P>
<P>
   McCain himself probably does not know what he wants at this
point. It is not inconceivable that he will try to play Jesse
Jackson to Bush's Michael Dukakis: carry his fight to the
convention despite being clearly defeated, negotiating for platform
language and a role at the convention. This seriously hurt Dukakis
in 1988, and could hurt Bush this year.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why, whatever game McCain ultimately chooses, Bush
should refuse to play.
</P>
<P>
   Pundits talk about the ``McCain voters.'' But in the
conventional sense of such a phrase, voters loyal to the political
leadership of a particular person, there are very few ``McCain
voters.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has been a truly national political figure for only a
little over a month, propelled to that status by his stunning
victory in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   McCain did attract a lot of voters, particularly Democrats and
Independents. Undoubtedly some of this was due to his compelling
personal history and service to his country. And it was driven by a
couple of issues: restoring honor and integrity to the presidency;
and redressing a sense of disassociation with the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   Although these voters were stimulated to vote for McCain, he is
not in a position to broker their support in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   They will make their own decisions, and George W. Bush can
appeal to them directly. He does not need John McCain to serve as
an intermediary.
</P>
<P>
   The American people are still making up their minds about George
W. Bush. And one of the questions they have is whether he is really
up to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the doubt about Bush is whether he has truly thought
through the issues, and whether he has, not even the courage of his
convictions, but merely the conviction of his convictions.
</P>
<P>
   During the presidential primaries, Bush sharply disagreed with
McCain about campaign finance reform. He said McCain's proposals
violated First Amendment rights and put the Republican Party at a
tactical disadvantage by leaving unions free to spend dues money on
campaigns without the express approval of their members.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush to now abandon those principles in a transparent deal
for McCain's support would simply reinforce the doubts the American
people have about him, and hurt him far more than McCain's
undoubtedly tepid support would help.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that Bush should abandon the voters who found
McCain attractive. He has his own case to make about restoring
honor and integrity to the presidency, particularly running against
``No Controlling Authority'' Gore.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush has his own case to make on redressing the sense of
disassociation with the federal government, although it is a more
complex argument than McCain's since it involves changing policies
rather than the election process.
</P>
<P>
   With respect to McCain, Bush should make it clear that while he
welcomes McCain's support, there are fundamental differences on
campaign finance reform that exist, and will continue to exist. He
should point out that McCain now faces the same choice as every
other American, whether Bush or Al Gore is better to lead the
country for the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush should not bargain with McCain over a prominent,
prime-time speaking slot at the convention. Bush should simply give
it to McCain, saying that McCain has earned it with his success
during the primaries. Bush should also say that he fully expects
McCain to use his time to advocate campaign reform proposals with
which he disagrees, but the Republican Party is big enough to
harbor and air such disagreements.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's best hope to become president is to chart his own course.
And let John McCain decide for himself the extent to which he wants
to play the spoiler. &QL;

   TECHNOLOGY
</P>
<P>
   NET-RECRUITING _ A new study looking at online recruiting says
the Internet may be a hot tool for finding workers, but it's still
no match for face-to-face job interviews. That hasn't deterred
companies from going online. The head of smallbizplanet.com, an
online information service based in midtown, posted listings for
software developers at 3 p.m. on Monday. An hour and a half later,
he had five prospects, ``three of which are excellent.'' (Joyner,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 25.

   MBA-TREND _ MBA students at Emory worked with CNN to develop and
refine the Turner South concept that finally went on the air. Can

company can use IBM to provide customers with Internet support,
including the capability of sending certified mail via the Net. The

   and restaurant supplies is expanding its service to reach
customers on the move. Hsupply.com, which brings together
procurement specialists and producers of consumable supplies like
tissue and soaps, is now making its service reachable by hand held
mobile devices. The service is headed by Ravi Kalakota, who has
left teaching duties at Georgia State University to devote full
time to developing the new web site. With the new wireless
capability, Kalakota said, Hsupply now allows busy executives to
approve, check the status of, and even place orders for operating
supplies instantly. The company is also developing regional
distribution points to shorten supply lines to customers. Asked if
teaching was now behind him, Kalakota, who now employes 70 people
in his Lake Hearn office, said ``let's say I have taken e-business
research to another stage, and we plan to devote the better part of
the next 10 years refining procurement sites like Hsupply.''

   PHOENIX - Remember Sen. John McCain's testy dismissal of MSNBC
reporter Maria Shriver (``Please get out of here!'') when she asked
him how he felt on his way to concede Super Tuesday to George W.
Bush? An affirmation of the senator's gnarly, snarly temperament,
you thought? Well, context is everything.
</P>
<P>
   According to media analyst Seth Mnookin, Shriver and her camera
crew that night ignored repeated requests by McCain's staff to
vacate the stairwell. Then, when the McCain family appeared,
Shriver burst past his staff, and her camera crew knocked over
McCain's 8-year-old daughter, visibly upsetting Cindy McCain.
</P>
<P>
   It was then Shriver asked her insipid ``Senator McCain, how are
you feeling tonight?'' question.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming Mnookin's investigation of the incident is accurate,
MSNBC and Shriver should be ashamed for having run that nasty
little snippet of film time and again without ever once revealing
the boorishness that precipitated it. &QL;

 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Gore and George W. Bush could wrap up the Democratic and
Republican nominations Tuesday in contests in six Southern states.
Voters were going to the polls in Gore's home state of Tennessee
and Bush's home state of Texas, as well as Florida, Mississippi,
Louisiana and Oklahoma. The six states were awarding 341 Republican
and 566 Democratic delegates Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   NOT NOW, BUT IN NOVEMBER
</P>
<P>
   Presidential preference voting in the South on Tuesday may be
anticlimactic, but presidential politics this year will still have
a drawl. The South exerted its influence on the nominations long
before the votes were cast. Each party will nominate a Southerner:
Democrat Al Gore of Tennessee and Republican George W. Bush of
Texas. Come November, though, the changing and increasingly
unpredictable region could be the decider on which one wins.
</P>
<P>
   NOT-SO-SOLID SOUTH
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have been gaining strength in the once solidly
Democratic South in the last two decades. But Democrats slowed
their progress in 1998 by winning governors races in Alabama and
South Carolina and retaining the Georgia governorship. Exit polls
suggest a big turnout of black voters combined with strong support
from independents and some crossover Republicans were key to
Democratic wins in 1998. Arkansan Bill Clinton was able to carve
away four of 11 Southern states: Arkansas, Tennessee and Louisiana
in both 1992 and 1996, plus Georgia in 1992 and Florida in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   THIS POLL PUTS BUSH ON TOP
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush holds a 49 percent to 43 percent edge over Al
Gore in the latest USA Today/CNN/Gallup Poll. Other recent polls
have shown similarly close results, with Bush slightly ahead of
Gore and Gore slightly ahead of Bush in two polls released over the
weekend. The poll (taken Friday through Sunday, with a 5 percentage
point margin of error) found Bush picking up more of the McCain
supporters: McCain Republicans, 80 percent to 14 percent for Bush;
McCain independents, 46 percent to 37 percent for Bush; McCain
Democrats, 76 percent to 13 percent for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   BALLOT NOT SECRET WITH THESE GUYS
</P>
<P>
   After voting for himself in Carthage, Tenn., Al Gore was heading
later Tuesday to Tallahassee, Fla., George W. Bush, the Texas
governor, was tending to state business after voting for himself
last week by absentee ballot. He'll view the returns tonight from a
community center in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   HIS SON'S GOT HIS HEART
</P>
<P>
   Ex-President George Bush voted for his son, George W. Bush, on
Tuesday to follow in his footsteps. After casting ballots alongside
his wife, Barbara, in Houston, the elder Bush said his emotions
were hard to describe. ``It gets down to family and how lucky we
are,'' said the father, who insisted his recent bout of irregular
heartbeat wasn't related to the stress of his son's presidential
bid. ``Oh yeah,'' replied Mrs. Bush skeptically.
</P>
<P>
   CORPORATE BUCKS SWINGING BACK TO DEMOCRATS
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats are holding a fund-raising dinner tonight in
Washington and, the Wall Street Journal says, they're set to rake
in $7 million, more than double the take for the same event a year
ago. The change is because corporate donors who not long ago were
funneling most of their contributions to the Republicans, have now
split their giving. Representatives from AFLAC, BellSouth, General
Dynamics and AT&AMP;T all played prominent roles, according to the
Journal.
</P>
<P>
   FRIENDLY TAKEOVER
</P>
<P>
   Republican Party Chairman Jim Nicholson ``has begun turning the
party organization over'' to George W. Bush, The Denver Post
reported. Nicholson said he began discussing the transition with
Bush last Friday, but that details of the changes, including
Nicholson's role in the fall campaign, have yet to be determined.
ABC reported that Bush people also are expected to infiltrate the
RNC at lower levels _ something that will establish a presence at
the headquarters while reducing campaign overhead.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA ON GORE'S RADAR SCREEN
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, most polls showed Al Gore had no hope of beating
George W. Bush in Florida. Not only was Gore unpopular, but Bush
had an ace in the hole _ his brother, Jeb, Florida's popular
governor.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Gore is even with, if not leading, Bush in many
national polls, and Jeb Bush is running into local political
squalls, and Gore is suddenly thinking that Florida may be in play
in November. Monday marked Gore's seventh visit to Florida in the
last 12 months, and he was going back again Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   WIFELY INFLUENCE AND FUND-RAISING
</P>
<P>
   While President Clinton was pondering whether to stop in
Pakistan during his upcoming visit to South Asia, a group of
Pakistani-Americans in New York with a keen interest in the
decision raised $50,000 for his wife's Senate campaign. There was
nothing illegal about the Feb. 22 fund-raiser, a $1,000-a-plate
dinner on Staten Island: All the donors were U.S. citizens, the
organizers said. And no evidence has emerged that Hillary Clinton,
who told people at the dinner that she hoped her husband would
visit Pakistan, had influenced her husband's decision last week to
do so. ``The first lady's views were not part of the
decision-making process,'' said White House spokesman Mike Hammer.
</P>
<P>
   CHIPPING AWAY AT DONATIONS
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush is about to mine the high-tech industry once
again to help rebuild his war chest. This time his targets are the
industry execs who shelled out for Bill Bradley. Bradley was second
to Bush last year in fund-raising from the high-tech industry: Bush
raised $1.6 million, Bradley $1.1 million, Al Gore $840,000, John
McCain $410,476, according to the San Jose Mercury News. ``We're
obviously hoping that a number of the folks who were in the Bradley
camp will come across,'' said venture capitalist Floyd Kvamme, one
of Bush's leading backers in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   WORKING ON THE CITY LEVEL
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore met in Nashville, Tenn., with 30 mayors from across the
country. His campaign is hoping they'll provide a counterweight to
the many Republican governors working for George W. Bush. The
mayors included Dennis Archer of Detroit; Jerry Brown of Oakland,
Calif.; Sharpe James of Newark, N.J.; Wellington Webb of Denver;
Marc Morial of New Orleans; and Thomas Menino of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   NADER GOING NATIONWIDE
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocate and Green Party presidential candidate Ralph
Nader predicted he'll qualify for the November ballot in all 50
states. Nader told about 100 people at the University of Nevada,
Reno, that while the Reform Party is somewhat fractured, his party
is ``growing quite readily'' as an alternative to the Democratic
and Republican parties _ ``which is really one party with two heads
wearing makeup.'' The progressive Green Party, founded in 1996,
shares Thomas Jefferson's and James Madison's view of government as
``a public check against the excesses of monied interests,'' Nader
said.
</P>
<P>
   VENTURA STILL TRYING TO RAISE MCCAIN
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, the Reform Party's highest elected
official until he quit the party last month, said he spoke to John
McCain by phone shortly before McCain suspended his presidential
campaign last week. Ventura said McCain told him he had no plans to
leave the Republican Party to run for president. McCain also has
said publicly said he didn't want to bolt the GOP. But Ventura said
that if McCain did run as a third-party candidate, ``He'd make it
interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   CALL THIS A MAJOR COUP?
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore's campaign, which has spent the last week trying to
impress John McCain's voters, announced that McCain's Mississippi
coordinator, Jim Bass, has moved to the Gore camp. But at Bass'
news conference in Jackson on Monday, none of the assembled
political reporters had heard of Bass or knew that McCain had a
Mississippi organization. McCain had not visited the state to
campaign for Tuesday's primary, and had not opened a headquarters.
Bass said he had run for a state Senate seat a dozen years ago _ as
a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   PUTTING DEBATES IN HIBERNATION, TOO
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush again rebuffed Al Gore's offer to suspend all
advertising and hold twice-weekly debates. ``There is going to be
ample time to debate,'' Bush said. ``The best time to debate is
when people are paying attention. As much as we wish, America is
now going to go into a little hibernation period when it comes to
politics. They are going to go into the summer months and go on
vacation with their families.''
</P>
<P>
   REMEMBER WHAT VINCE LOMBARDI SAID
</P>
<P>
   John McCain fell just short of a moral victory in Washington
state, as election officials announced that he had lost the overall
vote total in the Feb. 29 primary by a fraction of a percentage
point, or 2,302 votes. George W. Bush was declared the top
vote-getter, with 402,278 votes, or 30.72 percent, to McCain's
399,976, or 30.55 percent. The only votes Republicans use for
selecting delegates are those of self-declared Republicans, and
Bush won that tally easily: 284,046 to 191,098.
</P>
<P>
   REFORMERS EVERYWHERE
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore says he's learned from his campaign finance mistakes and
wants to rid the nation of big-money politics. George W. Bush calls
himself a ``reformer with results.'' Pat Buchanan insists he is the
truest reformer of all. Without John McCain and Bill Bradley, where
do reform-minded voters turn? ``There's nobody,'' says John
Longmire, the Reform Party's Kentucky chairman. ``Every time you
turn around these days, somebody's claiming to be a reformer. It's
enough to make you want to throw up.''
</P>
<P>
   GOING AFTER HENRY'S HIDE
</P>
<P>
   Aiming to topple one of the biggest names in Congress, two
relatively unknown Democrats are competing for the nomination to
oppose Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.). Lawyer Brent Christensen, 37,
first met Hyde when, as a college student in the 1980s, he
delivered him a pizza. Also running is Thomas Cramer, 52, a
business consultant who ran against Hyde two years ago. Both have
sought to portray Hyde, a strong opponent of abortion, as out of
step with a district that they regard as moderate on social issues.
Hyde led the House members who prosecuted President Clinton at his
Senate impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   EIGHT ARROWS SHOOTING TO SUCCEED ARCHER
</P>
<P>
   Eight Republicans are competing in the Texas primary for a
chance to replace retiring Rep. Bill Archer, chairman of the House
Ways and Means Committee. The winner is considered a sure bet to
keep the seat in GOP hands. The solidly Republican 7th District is
centered in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   TEENS IRKED BY CIRCUMLOCUTION
</P>
<P>
   After receiving tepid applause from a diverse crowd at the Grace
King High School in Matairie, La., George W. Bush was confronted by
several teen-agers about his views on gay marriage, single mothers
and rumors of his own drug use. And it didn't take long for him to
make it clear he was irritated, by the last topic. ``There's a game
in politics that says, `Let's float a rumor and force somebody to
talk about it.' And I'm not playing the game,'' Bush said. ``I've
been investigated, they've had reporters all over my background.''
The Texas governor added: ``You can draw any conclusion you want,
but what you cannot draw is the conclusion that I have not brought
honor and respect when given the highest office in my state.''
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO MAYOR RACE SET
</P>
<P>
   A Superior Court judge narrowly beat out a wealthy banker to win
the second spot in the November runoff for mayor of San Diego. A
tally of absentee and other ballots that needed to be verified
showed Dick Murphy beat Peter Davis 41,874 to 41,705. Each polled
about 15.7 percent of the vote. The race had been too close to call
after the March 7 election. Of the 12 mayoral candidates, only
County Supervisor Ron Roberts had won enough support _ 26 percent _
to clearly advance to the runoff. All three are Republican. The
second round is needed because no one got at least 50 percent of
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ARKANSAS TRAVELER, SHE'S NOT
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton appears to be avoiding any appearances in
Arkansas. Online magazine Salon notes that she hasn't appeared in
Arkansas for nearly two years. Even Rudy Giuliani has been there
more recently. Last July, he attended a $500-a-plate fund-raiser
there. So far, according to Salon, Giuliani has raised $29,800 in
Arkansas, much more than Clinton's $11,450.
</P>
<P>
   REALLY BARRED FROM VOTING TUESDAY
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Wightman-Cervantes, seeking to take on Texas Republican
Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, won't be out glad-handing voters or
passing out campaign leaflets at polling places Tuesday. He's in
jail. The gadfly lawyer, one of five little-known Democrats vying
for the nomination, was arrested at his Dallas home last week and
is serving a 90-day sentence for contempt of court. The case grew
out of a long-standing dispute with a local judge.
Wightman-Cervantes accused the Dallas judicial establishment of
incarcerating him because of his allegations of corruption on the
bench.

AMATEUR LIVES OUT EGYPTOLOGY DREAMS

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Don on Kunz's first issue of `National Geographic`
transported him to ancient Egypt when he was 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was absolutely fascinated by what I read,'' he says. ``It
captivated me.''
</P>
<P>
   He dreamed of one day visiting the sphinx, the pyramids and the
burial grounds of the pharaohs _ perhaps on one of those tour buses
that rumble across the Sahara.
</P>
<P>
   What he never dreamed was that, 40 years later, he would be
crawling on his belly through the rubble of a tomb built 3,000
years ago by Ramses II and share credit for its discovery.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix lawyer also discovered that a man can have two
careers and that boys from Dubuque, Iowa, can grow up to be Indiana
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   It was a quirk of fate that brought Kunz to Egypt. That first
issue of `National Geographic` inspired him to study the world's
first civilization, which predated by centuries the empires of
Rome, Greece and China.
</P>
<P>
   But he chose law as his vocation, first earning a degree in
English at the University of Iowa and then a law degree at the
University of Arizona. The amateur Egyptologist fell in love,
married and reared three daughters. Three weddings and three
college educations drained his vacation kitty.
</P>
<P>
   ``There went the Egypt fund,'' he said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   But fate intervened in 1978, when Kunz read in the `Los Angeles
Times` that Kent Weeks, professor of Egyptology at the University
of California at Berkeley, was planning to search for a ``lost''
tomb somewhere in Luxor, the modern site of ancient Thebes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, wouldn't that be fun,'' Kunz says.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote Weeks, offering to come along and pay his own way.
Weeks politely declined, suggesting no lawyers were needed on the
archaeological team.
</P>
<P>
   Kunz persisted. Finally, an amused Weeks agreed, telling Kunz he
could come for a month if he could track down the team's camp.
</P>
<P>
   On May 1, 1978, Kunz flew to Cairo, then Luxor, and with the
help of a local boy found the Weeks crew in a shabby hotel on the
edge of the Sahara. Weeks was surprised but gracious and welcomed
the Phoenix lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Kunz went to work as an assistant to Weeks and the surveyors
assigned to map all of the tombs in the famed Valley of the Kings.
The sites had been mapped before, but using inconsistent criteria
and bench marks.
</P>
<P>
   In the stifling heat, a desert climate similar to that of
Phoenix, Weeks' team explored the tombs of Ramses III, IV, VII and
XI that year. In the Valley of the Kings lie all the tombs of the
pharaohs, including the boy king, Tutankhamen, last ruler of the
18th dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   At each site, the scientists sifted through every inch of soil
they removed to preserve artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was dirty and dusty work and I loved it,'' Kunz says. ``For
somebody who had been fascinated by this all his life and thought
he would go as a tourist, here I was with this group of
archaeologists, going through tombs room by room. . . . I was
extraordinarily lucky to be along at all.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be the first of nine trips he would make to the land of
his dreams.
</P>
<P>
   The great Ramses II, who ruled in the 19th dynasty from 1279 to
1213 B.C., is believed to have reigned during the Jewish exodus
from Egypt. Before he died at about the age of 89, he built a tomb,
now known as KV5 (for Kings Valley tomb No. 5) for 50 sons he bore
with three royal wives and a harem.
</P>
<P>
   That tomb was first discovered in the 1820s by British explorer
James Burton, who sketched and then abandoned the debris-filled
mausoleum, ravaged by 3,000 years of silt-saturated floods.
</P>
<P>
   From what Burton could see, the undecorated walls and chambers
looted thousands of years before were unimpressive and would pale
in comparison to the nearby tomb and treasures of King Tut,
discovered by Howard Carter in 1922.
</P>
<P>
   KV5 was forsaken and its location forgotten until Weeks began
snooping around.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Kunz got a call from Weeks asking him to rejoin the
team in a search for KV5. The Egyptian government was planning to
build a new road through the Valley of the Kings, which might
forever bury or destroy the lost tomb. Weeks had six months to
locate the burial chambers of 50 princes of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kent had no idea what he was going to find,'' Kunz says, but
the discovery would turn out to be the greatest since Tut's
treasures.
</P>
<P>
   Working with only a narrow spade, Weeks' team began digging in
the rocky soil and sand. After several days, they heard the sound
of archaeological triumph _ spade scraping on stone that meant they
had found the steps leading to the entrance of the tomb. They
cleared a path to an entryway marked by the cartouche of Ramses II,
a kind of marquee protected by the wings of the goddess Isis.
</P>
<P>
   With the ceiling of the tomb falling down, they hesitated to
enter. But given a cautious go-ahead by an Egyptian geologist,
Weeks called for three volunteers who could fit into the narrow
tunnel burrowed through the hardened sludge. A student, Catharine
Roehrig, was the first to enter. An Egyptian worker named Nubie was
the third. An ecstatic Kunz entered between them.
</P>
<P>
   Slithering on their bellies, and ``swimming'' through the debris
with their arms, the three made their way past the entryway and
into the burial rooms. It was a risky adventure, but, Kunz says,
``I was so excited I wasn't scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Measuring the length of the walls as they went, they finally
reached chambers where they could stand up and discovered that
James Burton had left his signature on the ceiling written in
lampblack.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next eight years, Weeks, now a professor with the
American University in Cairo and one of the world's leading
Egyptologists, returned again and again to excavate KV5 as the
government relocated its roadway. In 1995, he announced his
discovery of the tomb believed to be the largest in the Valley of
the Kings and perhaps in all of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   About 108 of a possible 150 chambers have been uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Weeks published a book detailing his work, `The Lost
Tomb` (William Morrow &AMP; Co.).
</P>
<P>
   Weeks has since excavated a stairway leading away from the tomb
possibly connecting with the nearby tomb of Ramses II himself, so
that father and sons could visit each other in the afterlife. The
mummy of Ramses II is housed in an Egyptian museum.
</P>
<P>
   Kunz has been to KV5 three times, last in 1998. He plans to
return this summer with wife Edith.
</P>
<P>
   For a boy from Dubuque, it's been an amazing adventure.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it means to me is we are living in a time when people can
indeed have two careers,'' Kunz says.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to 45 years as a litigator, Kunz has satisfied his
passion for ancient Egypt and stood beside the most illustrious
figures in modern Egyptology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I am extremely fortunate to have had this
opportunity,'' he says. ``It has been a source of more than
pleasure to do something like this.'' &QL;

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More than an inch of rain fell across portions of south-central
Texas on Tuesday as a moist flow of air from the Gulf of Mexico
spread into the region. Several thunderstorms also erupted as a
potent jet stream disturbance passing overhead augmented the ascent
of the humid air. This same disturbance will plod slowly eastward
Wednesday, shifting the zone of heavy showers and thunderstorms to
southeastern Texas and the lower Mississippi Valley. Though much of
the region has been recently dry, local flooding could occur in a
few spots.
</P>
<P>
   Breezes from the south and southwest will direct unseasonably
mild air into the Eastern states Wednesday. Spotty showers will
accompany the mild air across the southern Great Lakes and Ohio
Valley as a stream of moist flow arrives from Gulf states. Farther
east, partly to mostly sunny skies will persist near the Eastern
seaboard, where daytime readings will approach 60 degrees as far
north as New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Several inches of snow will accumulate Wednesday over portions
of the northern Great Lakes as a weak low pressure system crosses
the region. Snow will also fall in portions of Colorado as winds
from the east moisten and cool upon ascending the sloping terrain
of the Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Dry weather will prevail along the West Coast. Sunshine will be
plentiful across the region, though patchy clouds will linger near
the Olympic peninsula. Offshore breezes will promote unseasonably
warm conditions near the central and southern California coast,
where afternoon readings may reach the 70s in San Francisco and Los
Angeles. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: Weather Spotters Network &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many National Weather Service offices are currently sponsoring
severe- weather awareness weeks to prepare for the arrival of
thunderstorm season. While modern technology has increased greatly
the ability of meteorologists to observe and predict severe
thunderstorms and tornadoes, the weather service also maintains a
network of private citizens to watch for developing severe storms.
These so-called ``weather spotters'' spend hours learning the
important characteristics that distinguish developing severe storms
from otherwise harmless cloud formations. &QL;

<P>
   The  &UR; New York Times News Service &LR;  is planning an expanded
weather package, with a planned starting date of Monday, March 20,
to be transmitted Sunday, March 19. The package, consisting of a
weather map as a graphics file and a text file to accompany the
map, is available to graphics clients of the News Service.
</P>
<P>
   The new map grows to 4 columns in width (52 picas), from 3, and
is 6 inches deep; the old was 4\ inches deep. This new size permits
the insertion of cloud cover information, previously a separate
map, and the addition of many new cities (see list below).
</P>
<P>
   The map is available both in color and in black and white.
Because the map is much more detailed, we have devised an entirely
new palette of colors to make it easier to read the added
information.
</P>
<P>
   A sample of the new map is available at Wieck, Newscom,
Presslink and AP's GraphicsNet.
</P>
<P>
   Some papers using the old map may need extra time to make the
transition to a 4-column format. We will, for a limited time,
produce a 3-col version of the new map, but with only some of the
new map's additional cities.
</P>
<P>
   A summary of this information is included in each day's Graphics
Budget.

<P>
   KADUNA, Nigeria _ As soldiers in armored trucks blocked off the
street leading to the central mosque here to non-Muslims, thousands
of faithful arrived for Friday prayers. After worshiping under a
burned-out roof, the result of religious violence that has gripped
the city in recent weeks, the Muslim men spilled out of the mosque
and the soldiers reopened the street.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday the scene was repeated next door at St. Joseph's
Catholic Cathedral, which is separated only by a narrow alley from
the mosque. Christians walked past the charred remains of cars in
front of the church's blackened main entrance, under the soldiers'
watch.
</P>
<P>
   The proximity of the mosque and church was once a bright symbol
of Kaduna, the country's military capital and the north's political
center, a cosmopolitan meeting place for all Nigerians and one of
the best hopes for a unified Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   Today Kaduna has become the epicenter of a national battle that
on the surface is over states' right to adopt Islamic law, but
which is really about raw political power in Africa's most populous
country.
</P>
<P>
   The future of Nigeria, the most fragile of democracies, might be
decided in this battle. President Olusegun Obasanjo, who has
surprised many by the breadth and aggressiveness of his democratic
reforms, is facing the most serious threat to his 10-month-old
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the northern Muslim elite _ which ruled Nigeria
for most of its history but has found its power greatly diminished
under Obasanjo, a Christian _ seem to have seized on religion to
galvanize their forces and challenge the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   After Muslims marched here calling for the adoption of the
Shariah, the Islamic social and penal code, a counterdemonstration
by Christians led to riots. At least 400 people were killed. A
history of religious coexistence quickly gave way to extremism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shariah must be done; Shariah is law,'' rioters scrawled on
the houses of destroyed neighborhoods. Christians invaded the state
house and wrote at the main gate: ``Shariah is dead. Shariah is not
Y2K compliant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Kaduna, the tolerant, pluralistic Kaduna we were so proud
of, is gone,'' said Festus Okoye, a Christian lawyer who has
practiced here for 15 years and is the founder of a human rights
organization. ``The fabric of intercommunal relations is completely
broken. What took place here had nothing to do with religion.
Religion was the mask, as always. What took place here was the
struggle for power in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kaduna will never be the same again,'' he added. ``Never.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Nigeria will ever be the same again is a question many
people are asking. As the killings in Kaduna have led to hundreds
of more deaths in the Christian east and then in Sokoto in the
north, the home of Islam, many are asking how many further blows
Nigerian unity can withstand.
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo described the violence as ``one of the worst incidents
of bloodletting that his country has witnessed since the civil
war'' in which the secession of Biafra nearly broke up Nigeria
three decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria, like another newly democratic giant, Indonesia, has
seen a surge in ethnic, religious and social violence since its
longtime military rulers gave up power last year.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands have been killed in a bewildering number of conflicts
across the country: ethnic groups fighting one another in the
oil-producing Niger Delta; ethnic minorities fighting against the
emirate system in the town of Kafanchan; members belonging to
subgroups of the same ethnic group fighting each other for land.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos, the steamy commercial capital that teeters toward chaos
on its best days, has recently suffered deadly riots almost weekly.
Incidents like a truck driver accidentally hitting a crowd of
pedestrians are enough to set off killings with religious and
ethnic overtones.
</P>
<P>
   The conflicts have all had in common a particular group's quest
for power in a country where such quests were brutally and swiftly
quelled for years by the military rulers.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo, whose handling of the Shariah issue has been
criticized as weak from all corners, has even said that the crisis
is an orchestrated campaign by those trying to destroy his
government.
</P>
<P>
   Doyin Okupe, Obasanjo's spokesman, said in a statement released
this weekend: ``The enemies of this administration who hide under
the cloak of religious piety to try to destabilize it will fail
collectively, as it is not in the manifest destiny of this country
that it should disintegrate.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The events that culminated in Kaduna began in October when the
governor of the remote northwestern state of Zamfara announced his
intention to enact the Shariah as state law.
</P>
<P>
   Soon schools were segregated into single-sex institutions,
hotels and bars stopped serving alcohol and taxis for women only
began appearing on the streets of the state capital, Gusau. In
February, a man who was caught drinking alcohol in public received
80 lashes with a cane as punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria's northern states, which are predominantly Muslim, have
always incorporated the Shariah into their legal system, applying
it to issues like marriage, inheritance and divorce. The
predominantly Christian south has simply relied on English common
law.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Zamfara's governor, Ahmed Sani, said he was merely
trying to increase his flagging popularity by taking the Shariah to
a new level, one that might eventually cover criminal matters and,
in theory, include such punishments as amputation of hands.
</P>
<P>
   His administration said it was motivated by religious piety and
that the adoption of the Shariah was a reaction to widespread
corruption in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the governor's true motives, he found himself
transformed overnight into one of the most famous politicians in
Nigeria. As the move predictably drew fierce protests from
non-Muslims who argue that the Shariah was against the Nigerian
constitution, Zamfara came to be seen as the chief defender of
Islam in a country now governed by a Christian.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders in other northern states announced that they also
planned to introduce the Shariah. Besides Zamfara, the states of
Sokoto and Kebbi have adopted Islamic law. They ignored the appeals
of the Obasanjo government, which pressed states considering the
move to put their decisions on hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you didn't implement Sharia, your faith became
questionable,'' said Umaru Dikko, a Muslim northerner who served as
a minister of transportation in the short-lived elected government
of President Shehu Shagari in the early 1980s. ``There are some
politicians who used Sharia to make themselves popular. But
religion is a very serious business in Nigeria. So after Sharia
came, the extremists jumped at it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kaduna, the march and counter-demonstration resulted in 400
deaths, according to the official tally, though many people believe
the real figure rached the thousands. Countless churches and
mosques were set afire in the city's center and poorest
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the slum of Narahi, a predominantly Christian neighborhood,
row after row of Muslim-owned houses were devastated. The strong
smell of smoke lingered in the air. A chicken and her chicks, their
feathers blackened, wandered around a street with a gutted mosque;
nearby, some pigs searched for food among the ruins, their pink
snouts black from the ashes.

 &HT;    COURT, CONGRESS CONSIDERING 'PROMISES' TO VETS
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The question sounds simple: Must the Pentagon keep
promises that it admits its recruiters made decades ago to young
men and women considering careers in the military?
</P>
<P>
   With an estimated billions of dollars riding on the answer, it
is a question that has caused a group of aging military retirees to
muster up for one more fight, this time with court briefs and
congressional letter-writing campaigns as their weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The Class Act Group argues that the government promised, and its
members earned, free medical care for life.
</P>
<P>
   That is not what they are getting. When military retirees reach
65 they are enrolled in Medicare and their right to free care at
military hospitals is terminated. They are eligible for free
medicine, provided the ones they need are on a given military
hospital's list of available drugs.
</P>
<P>
   A fight shaping up in Congress has two of the Senate's most
powerful Republicans, Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi and
Armed Services Committee Chairman John Warner of Virginia, reading
increasingly angry mail from veterans in their states.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Lott nor Warner has signed onto a ``keep the promise''
bill introduced by Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., Paul Coverdell,
R-Ga., and Tim Johnson, D-S.D., to provide the free medical care.
</P>
<P>
   Although a companion bill in the House has been endorsed by more
than enough members to pass it, there is serious question whether
it can pass the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   And a federal appeals court in Washington has just begun
consideration of arcane legal arguments over whether the military's
promise constituted a binding contract with the government.
</P>
<P>
   The Class Act Group is headed by Fort Walton Beach, Fla., lawyer
George (Bud) Day, a retired Medal of Honor-winning Air Force
colonel who was McCain's cellmate when both were prisoners of war
in North Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   In a suit filed in federal court in Pensacola, Day has asked
that the Pentagon be required to provide the free medical care and
that ``Part B'' Medicare premiums they have paid be refunded. The
suit applies only to men and women who joined the military prior to
June 1956, when the Defense Department health care system was
reorganized, and only to those who are 65 or older.
</P>
<P>
   Although Day argued that by forcing the retirees into Medicare
the Defense Department was guilty of breach of contract, a federal
judge ruled he could not force the government to keep the promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must conclude that the plaintiffs certainly have a strong
equitable argument that the government should abide by its
promises,'' U.S. District Judge Roger Vinson wrote in August 1998.
``Regrettably, the law does not permit me to order the United
States to do so under the constitutional separation of powers.
Relief must come from Congress and not the judiciary.''
</P>
<P>
   Day appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Federal District. In arguments before a three-judge panel last
week, Defense Department lawyers acknowledged that recruiters had
made promises of free medical care for life and that top military
officials in Washington had told them to.
</P>
<P>
   However, the government argued that without authorization from
Congress, the military could not have legally entered a binding
``contract'' with the enlistees and with officers considering
additional tours.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Judge Pauline Newman asked government lawyer Roy
Hawkins, ``You're not telling us that these promises were not made.
You're just saying they don't have to be kept?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's correct, your honor,'' Hawkins replied.
</P>
<P>
   The court may not issue a ruling on Day's appeal for several
months.
</P>
<P>
   With attention now on the bills in Congress, heat is growing on
Lott, who has introduced a bill to free up military hospital drugs
for retirees but has refused to support the ``keep the promise''
bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame Sen. Lott has chosen to turn his back on 23,846
retirees and their families in Mississippi, and also, as Senate
Majority Leader, on all the retirees in the nation,'' military
retiree Jim Whittington wrote in one of several letters published
by the the Biloxi Herald Sun this week.

 KADUNA: the ashes.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   During the weekend in Sokoto, Christians continued to leave the
state. At the main bus station, Peter Ekeson, 37, an Ibo from the
southeast, was looking to buy tickets for his wife and child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lived here for 20 years,'' Ekeson said. ``Most of us are
sending our wives and children back home. And many of the men have
left. They have sold their goods at moderate prices or are shipping
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind Ekeson, two large trucks waited to leave for the
southeast, piled high with refrigerators, televisions, mattresses,
drums and other pieces of furniture. A passenger bus also waited;
the lettering above its windshield announced: ``All over.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed Mohammed Makarfi, the 43-year-old governor of Kaduna
state, said the conflict could have been over in a different way.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could have been avoided if the right thing had been done
at the right time,'' said Makarfi, who belongs to the same party as
Obasanjo, the People's Democratic Party. ``The federal government
should have been decisive and sent the issue to the Supreme Court.
The court would issue a decision on Sharia and the executive would
enforce it. And it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a suggestion that many in Nigeria, including members of
the national legislature, have made. But so far, Obasanjo has
steadfastly resisted it, arguing ``that a legal solution may carry
in its wake chaos, pandemonium and further communal hostilities
which is undesirable,'' his spokesman, Okupe, said over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Most people believe, though, that Obasanjo has acted cautiously
because of his own particular place in Nigerian history and his
increasingly delicate relationship with the northern Muslim elite.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the death of the dictator Gen. Sani Abacha in June
1998, Moshood K.O. Abiola, a Yoruba businessman who had been denied
a victory in the 1993 presidential elections by the military, also
died suddenly.
</P>
<P>
   Many Yoruba _ who are one of Nigeria's three main ethnic groups,
with the Hausa and Ibo _ talked of breaking away from Nigeria. In
order to pacify the Yoruba, the northern Muslim elite agreed on a
``power shift'' _ they would yield the presidency to a southerner,
though not any southerner.
</P>
<P>
   Their candidate was Obasanjo, who had served as president of
Nigeria for the first time from 1976 to 1979 after Gen. Murtala
Muhammad, a northerner, was killed in a failed coup. During that
tenure, Obasanjo was seen to have preserved the status quo, thereby
earning the north's enduring trust and his own people's mistrust.
</P>
<P>
   The result was that in last year's elections, Obasanjo was
elected with votes from the north and the southeast. His own
people, the Yoruba, rejected him unanimously.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``But Obasanjo was no longer the Obasanjo of 1979,'' said Julius
Okolo, a professor of political science at Usman dan Fodio
University in Sokoto, pointing out the widely held belief that the
real power during his first presidency lay with a northern general,
Shehu Yar'Adua. ``Now he is his own man.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after taking office, Obasanjo embarked on aggressive
campaigns to clean up the military, re-examine past abuses, and
flush out corruption. Describing himself as a ``detribalized''
politician, he made appointments by choosing names from all over
the country. For instance, a Muslim Hausa from the northern half of
the state typically received a ministerial position in the past;
this time, it was a Christian from southern Kaduna who became a
minister.
</P>
<P>
   The moves angered many northerners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obasanjo has tried to reach out to everyone,'' said Aliko
Mohammed, 65, a prominent northern businessman who once served as
president of Nigeria's stock exchange. ``The north is surprised
that Obasanjo is not acting like a typical Nigerian politician _
winner-take-all. Having got the support of the north, he is now
rewarding his own people, who did not even vote for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his own independence, Obasanjo is now faced with trying
to hold together a nation that since its own independence in 1960
has been a country of competing forces. The military rulers
concentrated power in an increasingly small number of hands, even
as centrifugal forces created more and more divisions.
</P>
<P>
   From three regions in 1960, the number of states has climbed
gradually over the years, to its current number of 36. Three
decades ago, a million people were killed in the Biafran civil war,
when the Ibo tried to secede.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between 1967 when Biafra started and now, we have not solved
the fundamental problem that threatens the existence of Nigeria,''
said Dr. Abayomi Ferreira, a medical doctor who served in the war
and who is involved in politics. ``The history of Nigeria has been
the recurrent struggle of one group after another fighting for
self-determination.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why Ferreira and many others in Nigeria are now calling
for a restructuring of the country. Many _ including the governors
of all five Ibo states _ are proposing that Nigeria become a
country of a few large, autonomous regions, with a relatively weak
federal government.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Obasanjo has rejected the proposal, saying that its proponents
were exploiting the current situation with ``unfounded claims of
marginalization.''
</P>
<P>
   But those claims have gotten louder. Separatist groups have
mushroomed. Ralph Uwazuruike, 41, an Ibo lawyer, founded his
organization, the Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign
State of Biafra, a few months ago. The Ibo had supported Obasanjo
in the elections, but had not benefited enough in his
administration, he said, voicing a common complaint of his ethnic
group.
</P>
<P>
   So Uwazuruike wanted out of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody to his tent,'' he said. ``Things fall apart if the
center cannot hold.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever structural changes the politicians might adopt for
Nigeria, the people have already started going into their tents.
</P>
<P>
   In Kaduna, Muslims have traditionally lived in the northern half
of the city and Christians in the south, separated by the River
Kaduna. But Nigerians of both faiths lived together in the two
biggest slums, Rigasa and Narahi, which suffered the greatest
devastation during last month's upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   Since the riots, separated by fear, Christians living in the
northern slum of Rigasa have moved to Narahi in the south; Muslims
have migrated in the opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday prayers, a truck laden with furniture rumbled along
the main road here, heading toward southern Kaduna. Half a dozen
Christians sat atop the heap, above a sign in the back that
proclaimed in bold, green letters: ``One Nigeria.''

   Here are the New York Times News Service Macintosh graphics
scheduled for AMs of Wednesday, 03/15/2000. They are available to
all NYT graphic clients via satellite on Associated Press
GraphicsNet, and will be posted on PressLink, Newscom and the Wieck
PhotoDatabase bulletin boards. For retransmission of graphics from
the AP, call the AP Service Desk at 212-621-7983.
</P>
<P>
   Non-subscribers may make individual graphics purchases or get
additional information by calling the NYT Photo/Graphics desk at
(212) 556-4204 between noon and 10 p.m. EST. ATTENTION EDITORS:

<P>
   The New York Times News Service is planning an expanded weather
package, with a planned starting date of Monday, March 20, to be
transmitted Sunday, March 19. The package, consisting of a weather
map as a graphics file and a text file to accompany the map, is
available to graphics clients of the News Service.
</P>
<P>
   The new map grows to 4 columns in width (52 picas), from 3, and
is 6 inches deep; the old was 4 inches deep. This new size permits
the insertion of cloud cover information, previously a separate
map, and the addition of many new cities (see list below).
</P>
<P>
   The map is available both in color and in black and white.
Because the map is much more detailed, we have devised an entirely
new palette of colors to make it easier to read the added
information. A sample of the new map is available at Wieck,
Newscom, Presslink and AP's GraphicsNet.
</P>
<P>
   Some papers using the old map may need extra time to make the
transition to a 4-column format. We will, for a limited time,
produce a 3-col version of the new map, but with only some of the
new map's additional cities.

NBA GAMES ARE A SINKER 
BIG GAME HUNTING
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When NBC signed its latest deal with the National Basketball
Association three years ago, the network paid a huge increase in
its rights fee to a total of $1.75 billion, up from $750 million in
the previous four-year deal. But Dick Ebersol, the president of NBC
Sports, was elated, saying, ``The value of the NBA is only
increasing.''
</P>
<P>
   Garth Ancier may not agree. The president of NBC Entertainment,
who is responsible for NBC's prime-time schedule, has a big problem
on his hands right now, and it begins with the letters N-B-A.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a woeful performance in prime time by the NBA games
on Sunday night, NBC recorded the lowest rating the network has
ever scored in prime time during a television season.
</P>
<P>
   The games broadcast by NBC _ one involving the Knicks and the
San Antonio Spurs, a rematch of last year's finals, and the other
between Toronto and Seattle, featuring the league's latest great
Michael Jordan hope, Vince Carter _ reached only 4.6 million
viewers in more than two hours of prime-time Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   That led into NBC's movie for the night, ``Donnie Brasco,''
which was a similar disaster, reaching fewer than 6 million
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA games are of particular concern both because of the cost
to NBC and because it has become the network's primary sports
franchise. NBC abandoned its deal with the National Football League
two years ago partly because it had such confidence in the strength
of the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   But the NFL has continued to be a strong television attraction,
both on Sunday afternoons and in prime time. The NBA meanwhile is
off more than 15 percent in the afternoons, and the prime-time
numbers have been so bad, shows on cable have been beating the
games.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, both the highly promoted ``Raising the Mammoth''
special on Discovery and the latest episode of ``The Sopranos'' on
HBO dwarfed the audience for the NBA. The ``Mammoth'' special
pulled in more than 10 million viewers. Even though HBO is only
available in about a quarter as many homes as NBC is, ``The
Sopranos'' attracted more than 7 million viewers. (That also easily
beat ``Donnie Brasco,'' proving that it is a special kind of folly
to schedule a mob movie against what critics call the best mob
television show ever produced.)
</P>
<P>
   Had it counted as a network program, even a new series on
Nickelodeon, ``Caitlin's Way,'' would have left the NBA in the
dust. That show, the first real action-adventure series Nickelodeon
has tried, scored the best rating of any series in that channel's
history. It pulled in more than 6 million viewers on Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA games have been killing NBC's chances for Sunday night,
the most heavily viewed night of television. The shows that have
followed invariably have suffered because of the poor lead-ins from
the games.
</P>
<P>
   NBC had a much stronger lineup on Sundays in the fall with
``Dateline'' at 7 and ``Third Watch'' at 8. While neither of those
shows had huge ratings, they kept NBC respectable on Sunday. Now
``Dateline'' is sometimes reduced to a half-hour or even as little
as 10 minutes on Sunday because of the length of the basketball
games. ``Third Watch'' is now on Mondays and thriving.
</P>
<P>
   NBC has few options for Sunday for the rest of its NBA deal. It
is obligated to put at least seven games in prime time before the
playoffs. That may make it a long, cold spring for the network on
Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol said in a telephone interview Tuesday that he was
concerned about the poor performance of the games in prime time but
not worried for the long-term health of NBC's relationship with the
league.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NBA has been extremely successful in prime time for more
than a decade,'' Ebersol said. ``We look at this as a transitional
year.''
</P>
<P>
   The transition, he said, is from the Jordan years to an era in
which the league will be dominated by other stars like Carter and
Kobe Bryant of the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NBA will continue to perform well in prime time in the
future,'' Ebersol said. He added that he had confidence in David
Stern, the NBA commissioner, to address the league's problems.
</P>
<P>
   The first step Stern has taken to juice up interest in the
broadcasts is a controversial one: He is ordering coaches to wear
microphones during games, and if they refuse he is fining their
teams $100,000. Several coaches have already refused.
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol said: ``I'm not a fair weather programmer. I believe in
this franchise.''
</P>

<P>
   Big Game Hunting
</P>
<P>
   The Discovery Channel even surprised itself with the success of
``Raising the Mammoth'' on Sunday, logging the highest number of
viewers in the channel's 15-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery asserted it was the most watched documentary in cable
television history.
</P>
<P>
   The two-hour documentary, about an expedition last fall that
pulled a 20,300-year-old woolly mammoth from the Siberian tundra,
averaged 10.1 million viewers during its 8 p.m. showing, an
impressive audience for a show on cable. If the documentary had
appeared on one of the broadcast networks, it would have ranked
50th for the week of March 6, tied with ABC's ``Two Guys and a
Girl'' and ahead of CBS's ``48 Hours'' (9.8 million) and NBC's
``Will &AMP; Grace'' (9.6 million).
</P>
<P>
   Lynn McReynolds, a Discovery Channel spokeswoman, said the
documentary attracted the highest number of viewers of any
nonsporting event on cable so far this television season. The only
show that has ever come close for Discovery was ``Titanic: Anatomy
of a Disaster,'' which had about 4.9 million viewers when it was
first shown in April 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think even we anticipated the magnitude of the
response,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   McReynolds said the network did not promote the documentary more
than any other major presentation in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Crucial to the program's success, she said, was that viewers
tended to stay with it after they tuned in.
</P>
<P>
   That was apparently because compelling scenes showed the small
expedition _ financed in part by the Discovery Channel _ battling
blizzards and arctic temperatures as they struggled to unearth the
mammoth. ``But I do think people have an interest in large,
ancient, extinct animals like the mammoth,'' McReynolds said.
</P>
<P>
   Or, on a Sunday night at least, in something other than ``The
X-Files,'' ``The Practice'' or some old movie.

   GENOME-IMPACT (Undated) _ Technology stocks tumbled Tuesday
after President Clinton and Britain's Tony Blair jointly declared
that scientists around the world should have free access to
research on the mapping of human genes. They called research into
the human genetic blueprint was ``one of the most significant
scientific projects of all time.'' This prompted investors to sell
biotechnology shares on worries the companies' proprietary

   FIRST-ALLIANCE (Undated) _ First Alliance, a home-equity lender,
has been accused by scores of consumers of using a deceptive sales
pitch to lure homeowners into high-cost loans that expose them to
the threat of foreclosure and financial ruin. While the company,
which steadfastly denies wrongdoing, has increasingly come under
scrutiny by regulators, it still has some very important support:
Wall Street. Investment banks have pumped hundreds of millions of
dollars more into First Alliance in recent years, even as civil
lawsuits and state investigations have raised increasingly
troubling questions about its business practices. The money raised
by Wall Street for First Alliance and dozens of similar companies
has fueled a quiet revolution in the financial habits of millions
of Americans, known as ``subprime borrowers,'' whose low incomes or
blemished credit histories otherwise prevented them from obtaining
conventional loans. A Special Report based on an investigation by

private school tuition, curtailing the state's voucher program, the
nation's boldest experiment at using market pressure to improve
failing schools. The decision, which the state says it will appeal,

SKAKEL TELLS VICTIM'S MOTHER: `YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG GUY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. _ ``I feel your pain, but you've got the wrong
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   With those words, spoken softly Tuesday in a tiny courtroom,
Michael Skakel shook his head and reintroduced himself to the
mother of the Greenwich teenager he is accused of savagely
murdering nearly 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Dorthy Moxley stared at Skakel, with no apparent emotion, and
did not answer her onetime neighbor, a man she had not seen since
her 15-year-old daughter, Martha, was found bludgeoned and stabbed
in October 1975.
</P>
<P>
   The response was left to John Moxley, the victim's brother:
``We'll find out in court.''
</P>
<P>
   With that exchange, the parties left Juvenile Court and faced a
horde of reporters, microphones and television cameras drawn to the
case's mix of celebrity, weath and mystery.
</P>
<P>
   The judicial progress Tuesday was only incremental: Skakel, the
39-year-old nephew of Ethel Kennedy, will return to court June 20
for a hearing to determine if he will be tried as an adult for a
crime he allegedly committed as a 15-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   But for the Moxleys, the importance of the court appearance was
immense. ``It's like breathing again,'' said John Moxley, who lives
in Shore Hills, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like a miracle that we are where we are today,''
said Dorthy Moxley, who also lives in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Moxley, whose body was discovered under low-hanging tree
branches on her family's estate, had been beaten with a 6-iron and
stabbed in the throat with the golf club's broken shaft. The weapon
has been matched to a set of golf clubs owned by the Skakel family.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel's gesture Tuesday, which took defense attorney Michael
``Mickey'' Sherman by surprise, did not influence the Moxleys'
belief that Skakel killed Martha.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, heavens no,'' the victim's mother said when asked if
Skakel's comments had changed her thinking. ``I thought it was a
practiced statement. I really feel I know what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   John Moxley was more blunt. ``I think it's pretty consistent
with the way they've been for 24 years,'' Moxley said of Skakel and
his family. ``It's, `We're larger than life; here we are.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they're going to have to play by the rules. For the first
time in 24 years, we're swimming with the current.''
</P>
<P>
   Such thinking, that Skakel was shielded by his family's wealth
and power, has clouded a case that ran into dead-ends for more than
two decades. But in January, after a grand jury considered new
evidence that Skakel may have told others he committed the crime,
an arrest warrant was issued.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman Tuesday called the state's evidence flimsy, outdated,
and inconsistent. And he said he is undaunted by the prospect of
holding a trial in Superior Court, where Skakel could be sentenced
to life imprisonment if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to hide behind the juvenile court system,''
Sherman said. ``He has no idea who committed this crime. I think
I've met with him more than any other client ... and you get a gut
instinct.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe Michael Skakel. I believe him, and I believe in
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherman also said that Skakel's statement to the Moxleys was
genuine. ``He truly meant that. He does feel her pain,'' Sherman
said. ``He did not say it in any contrived manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Skakel was not asked by Juvenile Judge Maureen Dennis to enter a
plea Tuesday. He is free to return to his home in Hobe Sound, Fla.,
until his next court appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The new evidence against Skakel reportedly includes statements
from his former classmates at a Maine school that he admitted
killing Moxley, his neighbor in the exclusive Belle Haven enclave
of Greenwich.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman, however, said he has criss-crossed the country
interviewing former students from the Elan School for troubled
adolescents, and has not found evidence of any criminal admission.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Ricci, who owns and runs the Elan School and unsuccessfully
fought a subpoena for his testimony before the grand jury in this
case, told The Boston Globe in an earlier interview that Skakel
never confessed to killing Moxley. ``These people are lying,'' he
said of the former Elan students who said Skakel had confessed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Skakel has never confessed to this crime,'' said
Sherman, ``not to a student at the Elan School, not to a priest ...
not to no one.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators, however, also are suspicious of changes that
Skakel reportedly has made to the initial account of his activities
on the night of Moxley's death. Sherman said he is unimpressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't have a credibility problem. He has spin problems
because of the books that have been written,'' Sherman said. Author
Dominick Dunne, former Los Angeles police detective Mark Fuhrman,
and a former Greenwich newspaper reporter, have published books
about the slaying. Fuhrman's analysis, titled ``Murder in
Greenwich,'' identified Skakel as the likely killer and appeared
one month before Superior Court Judge George Thim was appointed as
a single-person grand jury in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Thim found probable cause to support the murder arrest warrant.
</P>
<P>
   Fuhrman, whose racial comments prompted a storm of controversy
in the O.J. Simpson murder trial, said Tuesday outside the
Connecticut courthouse that he believes Skakel will be convicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the evidence was flimsy at best, what are we doing here?''
said Fuhrman, who is working as a consultant for ABC News. He said
he does not fault Greenwich's relatively inexperienced
investigators, although at least one of them has conceded the probe
may have been less aggressive because of the influence enjoyed by
the people and neighborhood involved.

SOUTH NO SURE THING FOR BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLANT CITY, Fla. _ As he travels from state to state, the
candidate calls every place he stops ``Bush Country,'' with giant
posters and bumper stickers to match. And nowhere does the moniker
seem more fitting than here, in the land of the other Governor
Bush, where voters picked a Bush for president in 1992, when the
majority of the country did not.
</P>
<P>
   All of which has raised an obvious question in recent days: Why
is Governor George W. Bush already campaigning in Florida, if he
has it sewn up?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, Republican strategists admit, is that he doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as Bush heads into eight months of battle with Vice
President Al Gore, it appears he will have to continue wooing
voters all across the South _ a crucial voting region, with 147
electoral college votes. Despite decades of growing Republican
strength in the region, despite the Texas governor's ties there,
and despite his sweep in Tuesday's southern primaries, Bush cannot
assume he will beat Gore in a majority of southern states, several
strategists, political scientists and Bush advisors said.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, his own brother conceded the Florida race will be
``competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to take it for granted. It's a swing state,''
Florida Governor Jeb Bush said while campaigning outside Tampa.
``Bill Clinton won this state. George is going to get elected. But
it's going to take a lot of hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, delighted with a narrowing gap in the Florida polls since
last fall, is promising not to make it easier for Bush. Tuesday
night, Gore chose Florida as the site of his primary-night party,
while Bush stayed home in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   In the South as a whole, the reasons for the shift are partly
demographic and economic, and have evolved over the last two
election cycles, as the black population has grown and prosperity
has, in some sections, exploded. The religious right has lost some
of its clout. Democrats have regained some of theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Shifting local political crosscurrents have also played a role,
but the facts remain: Three southern states have elected Democratic
governors in the last six years. And in the last two presidential
elections, nearly half of the original 11 southern states of the
Old Confederacy voted for Bill Clinton and Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's focus on Florida as a state he could win is perhaps most
surprising, given the Bush family ties to the state, and George W.
Bush's own pride in being a son of the South.
</P>
<P>
   According to a poll conducted in early March by Mason-Dixon
Polling &AMP; Reserch Inc., Bush leads Gore by 45 to 37 percent. But he
trailed Gore among women, and the poll indicated Gore had narrowed
the gap in Florida from a poll in October, when he trailed Bush by
13 percentage points. A separate Florida Voter poll taken in
January, before Bush's overwhelming loss in the New Hampshire
primary, showed Bush beating Gore by a mere five points.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has raised significantly more money than his Democratic
opponent in the state _ some $4.3 million, compared with $1.4
million for Gore. And now that Bush has depleted nearly all of his
original $70 million war chest, he is returning to his brother's
stomping ground for more fundraisers, including one in Palm Beach
next week. But he is not there to simply pick up checks; according
to spokeswoman Mindy Tucker, Florida is already considered a ``key
battleground state.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida's politics are complex in part because the state is not
entirely southern in the traditional sense. Filled with elderly
retirees on Medicare, transplants from the the Northeast and a
large share of the region's immigrants, the state has long stood
somewhat apart, culturally, from the rest of the region. It is a
demographic phenomenon with political side-effects: While much of
the South was furiously ousting the old Democratic guard in the
1980s, Florida elected Senator Bob Graham, a Democrat, in 1986.
This year, a Democrat may win the other Senate seat, too.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Florida was one of four southern states that
swung in favor of the Clinton-Gore ticket in 1996. And Gore, who
moved his campaign headquarters to Nashville last year, prides
himself on being a son of the South as much as Bush does. Those
factors give Gore aides confidence they at least have a shot _ not
just in Florida, but in Georgia and North Carolina as well. (Like
Bush, Gore assumes he'll win his home state).
</P>
<P>
   ``The irony is that when this campaign season began, George W.
put Florida in the win column,'' Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said.
``But I think as people have gotten to know him (Bush) better, and
they've gotten to know Al Gore better, the fact that George W. is
so far out of the mainstream has had an impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Countered Ron Kaufman, a former political director to President
George Bush: ``Florida is absolutely Bush country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's every reason in the world to make sure the people of
Florida are taken care of,'' he said, in explaining why Bush is
bothering to visit the state at all. ``You do that now versus
October.''
</P>
<P>
   One political hurdle for Bush may be what many also consider his
greatest Florida asset: His brother.
</P>
<P>
   Under normal circumstances, the fraternal bond between candidate
and governor ``would be an asset,'' said professor Earl Black, an
expert in southern politics at Rice University in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Governor Bush has been controversial because of his One
Florida program,'' he said. The One Florida proposal would prohibit
using race as a factor in state university admissions or in
awarding state contracts. Blacks _ who are overwhelmingly
Democratic throughout the South _ and Hispanics have already
protested the initiative, and are threatening to turn out at the
polls to embarrass Jeb Bush by defeating his brother next fall,
several analysts said. But the younger Bush has stood resolute.
</P>
<P>
   ``What that's going to do is maximize black turnout in
Florida,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, where blacks comprise only about one-tenth of the
population, the impact of a high black turnout could be relatively
small.
</P>
<P>
   That is not the case elsewhere in the South, however. And Gore
is counting on it.
</P>
<P>
   In places such as Georgia and South Carolina, Democrats who win
90 percent of the black vote need only 40 percent of the white vote
to secure a political seat, according to professor Merle Black of
Emory University in Atlanta. Clinton capitalized on that pattern to
break the Republican stronghold in the region, and Gore aides say
they are hoping to use the same strategy throughout the South: draw
white voters, dominate among blacks.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, it is likely Gore will touch on the issues of race
and class that marked the GOP primary, perhaps even undescoring the
image that John McCain used to define Bush for weeks, his visit to
Bob Jones University in South Carolina. Such a tack by Gore would
likely Bush to pay extra attention to the southern states. Bush,
Merle Black said, ``needs to campaign in Florida, Georgia and North
Carolina as a result.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These big states, he can't take them for granted,'' Black
said. ``But we won't see him in South Carolina anymore this year.''

 SECRETS OF SUCCESS: Baking Better Butter Beans: Feta, parsley 
 punch up Greek-inspired dish from Palo Alto's Evvia  By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Few dishes are as satisfying as these Greek style
beans from Evvia, the upscale Greek restaurant in Palo Alto.
<P>
   Created by Jean Alberti, who is also the chef at its San
Francisco sister restaurant Kokkari, the hardest thing about making
this recipe is finding the butter beans, which are about the size
and texture of dried lima beans. But don't sweat the small stuff _
I've made them with smaller white beans and even cranberry beans,
with equal success. The only difference is that cooking time may
vary, depending on the variety of bean.
</P>
<P>
   The beans are combined with olive oil, tomatoes, garlic onion
and spices. After cooking, the beans are cooled and transferred to
a baking dish. They're topped with tangy feta cheese and fresh
parsley and baked until hot.
</P>
<P>
   These beans are great as a vegetarian main course, or as a side
dish to grilled or roasted meats. When we had them at Evvia the
beans were served as a starter, but they're also a great side dish
to accompany the grilled lamb chops or spit-roasted chicken.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the wood-fired oven and rotisserie that produce the
chops and chicken are the centerpiece of the menu, and a massive
fireplace opposite the open kitchen has become the focal point of
the sophisticated 120-seat dining room. The flames throw a soft
glow over the rustic interior _ a perfect complement to the
Greek-inspired food.

</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 pound large dried butter beans (lima beans), or other dried
beans
</P>
<P>
   10 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 large onion, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 pound ripe tomatoes, peeled, seeded and diced
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon dried oregano, or 1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano
</P>
<P>
   1 bay leaf
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   6 ounces Greek feta, crumbled
</P>
<P>
   11/2 tablespoons minced Italian parsley
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Place the beans in a large pot. Add enough water to cover the
beans. Soak for at least 4 hours or overnight. Drain and rinse the
beans.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the
onion and saute until it begins to caramelize, about 5 to 7
minutes. Add the garlic and saute 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes,
beans, oregano and bay leaf.
</P>
<P>
   Add enough water to barely cover the beans. Gently simmer until
the beans are just tender, about 1 to 11/2 hours, adding salt and
pepper the last 30 minutes of cooking. If the mixture is too soupy,
turn up the heat and boil until most of the liquid has evaporated.
Cool.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer the bean mixture to a casserole and top with feta
cheese and chopped parsley. Bake until the beans are warm and the
feta melts, about 15 to 20 minutes.

 BEST WAY: Sauteing Salmon   By Noel Advincula  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Salmon's distinctive flavor, its moist texture,
attractive color, year-round availability make it a very popular
fish. It's also high in vitamin A, B complex and omega-3 oils,
making it a good source of nutrients.
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are many ways to prepare salmon, but for this test we
picked stove-top sauteing. We used a 5-ounce skinless salmon
fillet, 11/2-inches thick, and cooked it to medium doneness. Each
fillet was checked for pinbones and seasoned with 1/8 teaspoon salt
and 1/8 teaspoon white pepper.
</P>
<P>
   The first step in finding the best way to saute salmon was
determining which fat to use. We tested olive oil, canola oil,
sweet whole butter, a mixture of olive oil and butter, using 2
tablespoons of fat per pan. We also used vegetable oil spray, just
enough to thoroughly coat the bottom of the pan. We then cooked the
fish over medium heat.
</P>
<P>
   The Food staff didn't care much for the salmon cooked in olive
or canola oil, and just about everyone disliked pan spray. The
unanimous choice was that sweet whole butter produced the best
tasting salmon. Second place went to the fillet cooked in the olive
oil and butter combination.
</P>
<P>
   We then tried various types of pans for cooking. An aluminum pan
browned the butter too quickly and left the fish an unappealing
dark color. A cast-iron pan lso cooked the fish very quickly and
browned the exterior almost immediately after contact. A 6-inch
heavy-duty non-stick pan, with the butter reduced to 1 tablespoon,
cooked the fish evenly through and produced the best overall
result.
</P>
<P>
   Finding the proper cooking temperature and time were the
trickiest parts of the test, and we tried several combinations.
Sauteing the fish for 11/2 minutes on each side over medium-high
heat produced a golden brown exterior and some staffers liked. But
the overall favorite was the fillet cooked at a medium temperature
for 11/2 minutes each side. It had the most flavor and was very
moist.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, we tested the best way to season the salmon. The fillet
that was seasoned before cooking tasted the best compared to the
one seasoned after or during the cooking process.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BEST WAY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   For moist and rich-tasting salmon, melt 1 tablespoon butter in a
6-inch heavy-duty non-stick pan over medium heat. Add a 5-ounce
salmon fillet, seasoned with salt and white pepper, and cook 11/2
minutes per side. Take the salmon out of the pan and let it rest
for 1 minute before serving _ this allows the fillet to arrive at
medium doneness. The salmon is perfectly cooked when the flesh is
opaque, firm and moist.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AN APPEALING ALTERNATIVE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If you have a non-stick grill pan, use it instead of a regular
pan. It will add attractive grill marks to the fillet and produces
the same results.

 LEARNING TO COOK: Versatile Dish Blends White and Brown Rice   By Marion Cunningham  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Here is a rice dish that is a good example of home
cooking at its best.
<P>
   Simple, versatile, inexpensive and healthful, serve it hot,
paired with toasted cheese sandwiches, for a satisfying supper. Or
serve it chilled or at room temperature for a main-dish salad. You
can also reheat it in a little olive oil, then add some grated
cheese for another pleasing meal.
</P>
<P>
   The most valuable step in cooking at home is to learn to taste
every dish as you prepare it. Anyone can critically taste, and
everyone has likes and dislikes about food. The bonus of being your
own cook is that you can please your own palate _ if you remember
to taste as you are cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Recipes have many variables. My stove and oven may work
differently from yours. My ingredients may be a different brand
than the ones you use. So, when you learn to taste as you are
making a dish you can see what timing works best in your own
kitchen and do what's necessary to create foods that you like. And
don't forget: You you can also eat most of your mistakes.

<P>
   1 tablespoon soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 cup long-grain white rice
</P>
<P>
   1 yellow onion
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch scallions (also called green onions)
</P>
<P>
   1 small green bell pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 small red bell pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 celery stalks
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup rice vinegar
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cooking the rice:  &LR; Combine the brown rice, chicken broth and
soy sauce in a 4- or 5-quart pot. Bring to a boil. Watch carefully
and reduce the heat to low as soon as the broth boils. Simmer for
10 minutes. Add the white rice. Stir, cover and cook for 15
minutes. It may take another 5 minutes for the rice to be done.
Test it for doneness by scooping out a few grains of rice and
tasting them. If they are tender, the rice is done.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Preparing the vegetables:  &LR; Start preparing the vegetables while
the rice is cooking. Peel off and discard the papery outer skin of
the onion. Cut off the stem top and root bottom of the onion. Cut
the onion in half through the stem end. Place each onion half
cut-side down on a cutting board. Cut each half into 1/4-inch
slices horizontally, then cut into 1/4-inch slices vertically, then
cut into 1/4-inch pieces crosswise. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Cut off the coarse green tops of the scallions, leaving a little
green if it looks fresh. Holding the scallions together, cut off
the roots and discard. Cut the scallions into small pieces; set
aside with the onion.
</P>
<P>
   Cut off the stems of the peppers, then cut each pepper in half
lengthwise. Cut out and discard the white veins and seeds. Cut each
pepper half into 1/4-inch strips. Hold the bundle of strips
together and cut crosswise into small pieces. Add to the onions.
</P>
<P>
   Trim off all the leaves from the celery. Slice each celery rib
lengthwise from top to bottom into 1/4-inch strips. Holding the
strips together, slice crosswise into small pieces. Add to the
onions and peppers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The dressing:  &LR; Combine the vinegar and oil in a small bowl and
stir briskly to blend.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Finishing the dish:  &LR; Using a fork, stir the cooked rice so the
brown and white grains are mixed together. Add all of the fresh
vegetables and mix into the rice. Add the vinegar and oil, then
season with salt and pepper. Using a fork and large spoon, toss and
mix everything together. Taste and add more salt and pepper if
needed.

 TASTER'S CHOICE: The Best Chips Off the Chocolate Block   By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Some people prefer milk chocolate chips to the
semisweet variety _ not so much for baking as for snacking. So
today's panel tasted five different milk chocolate chips.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The panel didn't reach a consensus on a favorite, but they
agreed they liked the majority of chips.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Belgian Recipe Gourmet &LR;  (500 grams, $6.75 at Draeger's) _ by
far the most expensive brand _ took first place. Panelists noted
the nontraditional drop shape instead of chip, but most liked the
chocolate flavor. One dissenter thought the chip tasted more like
sweetened condensed milk than chocolate. Another felt the chip was
too soft. Three would buy it; two might buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Second place went to locally made  &UR; Guittard &LR;  (11.5 ounces,
$2.19-$2.69 at many supermarkets). Some panelists liked the bigger
chip, but most of the panelists thought it was too sweet. Most
liked the chocolate flavor, however. One would buy it, three might
buy it, and one would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Nestle &LR;  (11.5 ounces, $2.49 at Andronico's) came in third. One
panelist described it as ``sweet even for milk chocolate,'' but
another thought it was less sweet than other brands. Three
described it as a good chip to bake in cookies. Two would buy it,
two might buy it, and one would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ghirardelli &LR;  (11.5 ounces, $2.69-$2.75 at many supermarkets)
came in fourth. One panelist liked that she could taste the
chocolate flavor instead of just the sweetness. But others thought
the chip lacked purity; one thought it tasted more like
butterscotch than chocolate. One would buy it, two might buy it,
and two would not.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth place went to  &UR; Hershey's &LR;  (11.5 ounces, $3.09 at Cala).
One panelist liked the ``snappy texture,'' but all detected
overtones other than chocolate such as cinnamon and vanilla. One
panelist wrote that it's ``not what I want in a chocolate chip.''
Another panelist thought it would be fine in cookies, but not for
snacking. One would buy it; four would not.
</P>

NEEDED ROAD REVENUE

<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson is right to resist
congressional impulses to cut gasoline taxes as a response to the
recent rebound in prices. America's need to maintain funding for
pressing infrastructure needs outweighs the effect those prices
have on most consumers.
</P>
<P>
   A number of factors justify keeping the tax at its current level
of 18.4 cents a gallon _ the most visible of which is to be seen in
the Big Dig here. But federally funded projects all over the
country are essential to keeping roads and bridges in good
condition. Work delayed today will simply be more work to be done
later at higher costs brought on by further deterioration and
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress want to suspend 4.3 cents of the federal
tax, adopted in 1993. Loss of that revenue would deprive the
federal highway fund of $600 million monthly, a significant figure.
By contrast, 4.3 cents less in gasoline taxes would provide a
typical driver who travels 10,000 miles a year in a car averaging
20 miles a gallon with $21.50 _ less than $2 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The spike in gasoline prices looks more dramatic in contrast
with the extreme lows of only 15 months ago, when prices dipped
below $1 a gallon. At that level, gasoline was cheaper in real
terms _ adjusted for inflation _ than at any time in history. A
combination of curtailed production by OPEC, the international oil
cartel, and lower inventories has driven prices for crude oil to
more than $30 a barrel now. But even at $30 a barrel, oil is far
below its peak in 1980, when it reached the equivalent of $70 a
barrel, adjusted for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers may not be impressed by these inflation-adjusted
figures. They see $1.60 a gallon at the gas pump, and that's higher
than what they are used to. But serious policymakers in Washington
_ and on Beacon Hill _ have an obligation to keep these realities
of inflation in mind as they mull responses to changing conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Some consumers are hurt by rising prices _ notably older people
on fixed incomes. They may need assistance, and they should get it.
But that is no reason for dismantling the revenue system necessary
to maintain an essential transportation network.

EDITORS NOTE: Each week, wine editor Gerald Boyd discusses a
variety of wine topics.  WINE POTPOURRI: Journey to a Pinot Promised Land  
   
 By Gerald D. Boyd  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  As the popularity of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir
continues to grow, consumers seek out different styles of both
wines. Today's Chronicle wine selections feature Carneros Pinot
Noirs, which are distinctive.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carneros sprawls across Napa and Sonoma counties just along the
northern edge of San Francisco Bay. The combination of cool climate
and low natural moisture produce mature Pinot grapes without the
loss of freshness. When young, Carneros Pinot Noir has the inviting
scent and flavor of fresh raspberry and tart cherry, with
underlying spice. With age, the wines develop earthy, mushroom and
tobacco flavors.
</P>
<P>
   The name Carneros comes from the Spanish word for rams or sheep,
because the rolling terrain was once lined with sheep ranches.
</P>
<P>
   Today Carneros is where the water ends and the wine begins. The
only sheep remaining are a few static ones, statues posing as art
in the vineyards, gazing with fixed stares from their meadow in
front of Winery Lake Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Carneros became the promised land for winemakers
looking for cool-climate Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. Large Napa
Valley wineries like Robert Mondavi, Charles Krug, Cuvaison,
Sterling Vineyards and Clos du Val had vineyards in the Napa part
of Carneros. Carneros also attracted a small but important
community of sparkling wine producers, with Gloria Ferrer in
Sonoma-Carneros and Domaine Carneros and Codorniu Napa in
Napa-Carneros. Mumm Napa Valley and Domaine Chandon, both Napa
Valley sparkling wine producers, have vineyards in Carneros.
</P>
<P>
   Carneros' rolling terrain is mainly low-lying, moderated by a
maritime climate and a combination of cool, foggy mornings and
warm, sunny afternoons. Wine grapes thrive in this kind of climate,
and growers have been successful with Chardonnay, Pinot Noir,
Merlot and Syrah.
</P>
<P>
   Carneros is one of the oldest vineyard regions in the state,
with vines being planted as early as the mid-1800s. But strong
winds and fog made grape growing difficult, and in the late 1880s
phylloxera, a plant louse that destroys vines, hit Carneros hard,
nearly wiping out the fledgling industry. Later, Prohibition,
delivered the knockout punch and Carneros as a wine district,
slipped into oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1940s, two Napa pioneers, Andre Tchelistcheff (then
winemaker at Beaulieu Vineyard) and Louis M. Martini established
vineyards in Carneros. Rene diRosa followed 20 years later with
Winery Lake Vineyard and other noted growers like Ira Lee and the
Sangiacomo family began to grow Carneros grapes that soon were in
demand by many wineries.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1970s, a growing collection of wineries invested their
future in Carneros, including Buena Vista, Saintsbury, Carneros
Creek Winery, Bouchaine, Mont St. John, Acacia, Kent Rasmussen,
Schug and Roche.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no other grape variety is more representative of the
Carneros style than Pinot Noir. It was the early Pinots that
Tchelistcheff made at Beaulieu Vineyard from Carneros fruit that
caused a Cabernet Sauvignon-focused wine community to recognize
that there was another viable red wine. Fact is, the lush and
fruity Carneros Pinot Noirs gave rise to the rumor that some
Cabernet fans had Pinot envy.
</P>
<P>
   The wineries and growers of the Carneros region work together
under a group known as the Carneros Quality Alliance. If you would
like more information about Carneros and its wines, call CQA, (707)
938-5906.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Abacus Counts &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, I was standing against the wall of the blending
room at the Johnnie Walker Scotch Whisky distillery in Scotland, my
mouth agape. I was watching the master blender taste hundreds of
samples of single malt and grain whiskies to decide which to
include in the blend that would become Johnnie Walker whisky.
</P>
<P>
   It was an astounding exercise that convinced me how important
blending is to whisky and wine. In fact, most wine people consider
blending to be the ultimate expression of a winemaker. To bring
together the various components of a wine, like a Bordeaux blend of
five different varieties, is a skill and an art.
</P>
<P>
   So it shouldn't be surprising that ZD Wines is charging $250 for
a bottle of Abacus, a blend of ZD Reserve Cabernet Sauvignons from
1992 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In what has to be the only California red wine aged in a solera,
winemaker Robert deLeuze has created a unique wine. Spaniards use
the solera method to produce sherry. It is a series of barrels,
usually in three stacked rows or scales. A specific amount of aged
sherry is drawn from the bottom scale and bottled. A like amount is
then drawn from the scale above up  &LR; and poured into the bottom
scale. New wine eventually is put into the top scale. The Spaniards
say the old wine in the solera ``educates'' the young wine.
</P>
<P>
   For the 1992-1998 Napa Valley Abacus, deLeuze used 15 percent of
the solera, placing the remaining 85 percent back into the barrel
to age and await the addition of the youthful fruit of the 1999
vintage.
</P>
<P>
   The first release of Abacus is sold out, but 200 more cases will
be released in November. Contact the winery at (707) 963-5188 for
information.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Napa Auction 2000 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Folks in the Napa Valley are gearing up for Kaleidoscope 2000,
the 20th Annual Napa Valley Wine Auction, June 1-4 at Meadowood
Napa Valley, sponsored by the Napa Valley Vintners Association.
</P>
<P>
   The complete auction package is $2,000 per couple. A limited
number of day passes are available. For more information or to
request an auction invitation package, call (800) 982-1371, then
press 4.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Wine Basics &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Merlot is fast becoming one of America's most popular red wines,
but it isn't without controversy. Once a blending grape in Bordeaux
that stood in the shadow of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot is more
widely planted there now than Cabernet. The shift is mainly due to
changing worldwide tastes for softer consumer-friendly red wines.
</P>
<P>
   Merlot from the best Pomerol chateaus, such as Petrus, will age
for 30 years, producing an elegant wine with great depth. But
so-called New World Merlots, especially from California, are softer
and rounder.
</P>
<P>
   Merlot is grown in all of California's main wine regions and
does well in Eastern Washington, Southern Oregon and New York's
Long Island. Popular Merlots also are available from Chile and
Northern Italy. New Zealand Merlots and Merlot-Cabernet blends from
Hawkes Bay are the latest finds from the Southern Hemisphere.

RESISTANCE TO IRANIAN REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Recent acts of political violence in Iran illuminate a
fundamental uncertainty haunting that strategically crucial
country. The attempted assassination Sunday of Saeed Hajjarian, a
newspaper editor and adviser to reformist President Mohammad
Khatami, suggests that the struggle for power between hardline
clerics and reformers may not be settled by peaceful, democratic
means.
</P>
<P>
   Hajjarian is one of the best-known figures to abjure the
hardline camp and pass over to the reformist side. In the early
days of the Islamic republic, he served as deputy intelligence
minister, instituting a secret service that has been blamed for
conducting assassinations abroad of Iranians defined as enemies of
the regime.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called conservatives are known to despise Hajjarian for
being a turncoat and for using his old intelligence contacts to
reveal that ``rogue'' elements in the Information Ministry were
behind the murders of five reformist intellectuals in late 1998.
The hardliners also had reason to resent attacks against them in
his newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Like other prominent reformist figures who changed camps,
Hajjarian had received death threats. The assailants who tried to
kill him in broad daylight escaped on a powerful motorcycle
identified as a model used only by Iranian security forces.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the attempted assassination of Hajjarian troubling is
that it could be a premonition of violent resistance to political
change. Conservative clerics are defending their political power,
their patronage, and, for some, considerable fortunes that were
acquired by gaining control of religious foundations that function
as corporate conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   Hajjarian was regarded by the diehards of the conservative camp
as the master strategist of the reformist movement. His paper
constantly attacked the hardliners and linked some of the most
highly placed among them to crimes such as the killings of
intellectuals. The fight for power in Iran may resemble a gang war,
and if so Washington will have to keep its distance for a while.

EDITORS NOTE: Here's a plan for getting quick meals on the table in
a hurry. Now &AMP; Later is a recipe cooked on the weekend in batches _
enough to serve 12 _ and functions as dinner on the night it's
prepared; freeze the rest for two future meals. The 30-Minute Main
Dish takes a half-hour or less of preparation and Fast &AMP; Fresh
gives you dinner in about 20 minutes. 
 
 THE WORKING COOK: Exotic Spices Put Pizzazz in Fish   By Tara Duggan  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  On its own, the fish in this week's Fast &AMP; Fresh
recipe, Fish Brochettes with Saffron Orzo &AMP; Charmoula, is mild,
almost bland. On a bed of buttery saffron orzo, things start
getting better.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But what really makes this dish zing is a drizzle of charmoula,
a traditional Middle Eastern condiment. Cumin and a dash of cayenne
in the sauce provide smoky heat, while lemon juice and parsley make
the flaky fish taste fresh and light.
</P>
<P>
   Simplicity is key in the next dish, Pan-Roasted Chicken with
Coriander Vegetables. The coriander-scented fennel, carrot and red
onion provide sweet and astringent flavors and a colorful backdrop
to a simple chicken breast, which is buttered up with a quick pan
sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure to season the chicken breast well and don't dry it out
too much in the oven. A quick searing over moderately high heat and
a zap in a hot oven will do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   The Portobello Moussaka recipe is more complicated but well
worth the time it takes to prepare _ about two hours, including
cooking time. Make it ahead for a dinner party or stash part of it
in your freezer for later.
</P>
<P>
   The allspice and cumin-flavored tomato sauce goes nicely with
bechamel, which also is infused with sweet spices like nutmeg and
cloves. These two thick sauces make for a gooey dish, but roasted
portobellos create a meaty base, and breadcrumbs add an essential
contrast in texture.

<P>
   FISH BROCHETTES WITH SAFFRON ORZO &AMP; CHARMOULA
</P>
<P>
   Charmoula is a piquant Middle Eastern sauce or marinade. This
one packs a punch; have diners add it to both the fish and orzo to
taste.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 shallot
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon butter
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound orzo pasta
</P>
<P>
   3 cups low-salt chicken or vegetable broth
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt + salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   Pinch saffron
</P>
<P>
   1 pound firm white fish
</P>
<P>
   Pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons chopped parsley
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon cayenne
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
</P>
<P>
   About 4 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oven to broil. Soak 8 wooden skewers in a large bowl of
water. Line a baking sheet (one that will fit under your broiler)
with foil and brush it lightly with olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   Mince the shallot. Melt the butter in a skillet. Add the shallot
and saute over medium heat until just tender, about 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Add the orzo and stir to coat with the butter, about 1 minute.
Add the broth and 1 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil and stir in the
saffron. Cover and simmer until the orzo is al dente, following
package directions.
</P>
<P>
   While the orzo cooks, cut the fish into 11/2-inch cubes. Season
lightly with salt and pepper and place 4 pieces on each skewer.
Place on the baking sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Place directly under the broiler and broil 4 minutes. Turn and
broil until flaky, about 4 more minutes.
</P>
<P>
   While the fish cooks, make the charmoula. Combine the parsley,
lemon juice, cayenne and cumin. Whisk in the olive oil and season
with salt. Transfer to a small serving bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Serve the brochettes on a bed of saffron orzo, and drizzle with
charmoula.

<P>
   Moussaka is a classic Greek casserole of sliced eggplant and
ground lamb, which often are layered with tomato sauce and
bechamel. This meatless version substitutes roasted Portobello
mushrooms for lamb.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   21/2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   6 large portobello mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste
</P>

   2 quarts milk
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces unsalted butter, cut into pieces
</P>
<P>
   1 cup + 1 tablespoon flour
</P>
<P>
   White pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Pinch nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   1 cup grated Parmesan
</P>
<P>
   8 garlic cloves
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon allspice
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon cumin
</P>
<P>
   2 (26-ounce) boxes Pomi chopped tomatoes, or canned tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 cup breadcrumbs
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with
aluminum foil and grease with olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the stems from the portobellos. Cut the caps into
1/4-inch-thick slices. Place on the baking sheets and season with
salt. Roast until very tender and slightly browned, 20 to 25
minutes. Set aside to cool.
</P>
<P>
   Cut 1 onion in half through the stem end. Attach the bay leaf to
the outside of the onion by piercing it with the clove. Place the
onion and the milk in a heavy saucepan and bring to a steady
simmer. Simmer for 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Melt the butter in a heavy skillet over low heat. Stir in the
flour. Cook this roux over very low heat, stirring often, for about
10 minutes. Do not let it brown.
</P>
<P>
   Strain the milk; discard the onion. Return milk to a clean
saucepan and whisk in the roux. Season with salt _ enough to bring
out the buttery flavor. Add a hint of white pepper and nutmeg.
Simmer gently for 20 minutes. When done, remove from the heat and
stir in the cheese. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; While the sauce simmers, chop the remaining onions and the
garlic. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet. Add the
onions and saute over medium-low heat for 5 minutes. Add the
garlic, allspice and cumin and saute for 10 minutes. Add the
tomatoes and sugar and simmer until the sauce is fairly thick,
about 20 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Reduce oven temperature to 350.
</P>
<P>
   Layer the mushrooms in two 3-quart casseroles, overlapping the
slices if necessary. Top each layer with half of the tomato sauce,
then half of the cheese sauce. Top each with breadcrumbs.
</P>
<P>
   Bake about 20 minutes, until heated through and golden brown on
top.
</P>
<P>
   Let cool for a few minutes before serving.

 COOK'S BOOKS: Hazan Targets Busy Home Cooks With `Every
Night  Italian'  By Noel Advincula 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Giuliano Hazan, heir to the traditions established
by his mother Marcella, the prima donna of Italian cooking, has
reached out to harried and hurried cooks in his second book,
``Every Night Italian.''
<P>
   Hazan's new book attempts to make Italian cooking easy and fast
without sacrificing flavor and integrity. ``I'd like to show
Americans how they, too, can prepare delicious meals every day,''
he writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simple'' is an apt description of the book. From the cover to
the ingredients and the recipe instructions, it's straightforward
and step by step. The book even contains illustrations on kitchen
basics such as chopping an onion, trimming artichokes, de-boning a
chicken, and sharpening a knife.
</P>

   The recipes I tested were true to the specified cooking times.
 &LR; Frittata alle Cipolline &LR; , an open faced omelet, was good, easy to
prepare and took just 25 minutes.  &LR; Crostata all'Arancia &LR; , a
Sicilian Orange Tart is more involved and good for company. It took
an hour and 40 minutes, but that included baking time, and the
result was beautiful and fresh-tasting. However, the bottom crust
got a gummy and could use more time in the oven.

   If one thing is missing from the book, it is photographs. Only
16 of the the 120 recipes have pictures, and a few more showing the
finished dishes would make things easier for the cook.

 &LR; ITALIAN OPEN-FACED OMELET WITH SCALLIONS
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   16 scallions
</P>
<P>
   11/2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons finely chopped Italian parsley
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces Montasio, cream Havarti, or mild cheddar
</P>
<P>
   8 extra-large eggs
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Remove the dark green tops of the scallions (approximately the
top third) and trim the root ends. Cut the scallions lengthwise in
half, then crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces. Rinse well in a strainer
under cold water.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Put 1 tablespoon of the butter
and the vegetable oil in an ovenproof 9- or 10-inch skillet,
preferably nonstick. Place over medium heat and add the scallions.
Season with salt and pepper and saute until they are tender and
have colored lightly.
</P>
<P>
   While the scallions are cooking, chop the parsley and grate the
cheese. Break the eggs into a mixing bowl and beat until the whites
and yolks are well mixed. Add the parsley, cheese and a little salt
and pepper. Lift the scallions out of the skillet with a slotted
spoon, leaving as much of the oil in the pan as possible, and stir
them into the egg mixture.
</P>
<P>
   Put the remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter in the skillet and
return it to medium heat. When the butter is hot, add the egg
mixture and cook, without stirring, for about 5 minutes to set the
bottom. Transfer the skillet to the oven and continue cooking until
the frittata looks firm when the pan is shaken, about 10 minutes.
Remove from the oven and slide the frittata onto a plate. Serve hot
or at room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4 to 6.

SICILIAN ORANGE TART
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Crust &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Grated zest of 2 oranges
</P>
<P>
   2 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   8 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into a dozen pieces
</P>
<P>
   3 extra-large egg yolks
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of salt
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon ice water, or more if needed
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Filling &LR;
</P>
<P>
   2 extra-large eggs
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup freshly squeezed orange juice (juice from the 2 oranges
is usually sufficient)
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; For the crust &LR; : Grate the orange zest using a light pressure on
the grater so as not to dig into the white pith, which is bitter.
Make the pastry shell by placing the flour, sugar, butter, egg
yolks, orange zest and salt in a food processor and running it
until the ingredients are well mixed. Add the ice water and run the
processor until a dough is formed. If the mixture is too dry and
does not hold together, add a little more ice water, 1 teaspoon at
a time.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the dough from the bowl of the processor (carefully
taking out the blade first) and place it on the removable bottom of
a shallow 11-inch tart pan. Using a rolling pin, roll out the dough
until it is no more than 1/4 inch thick, allowing the dough to
extend over the edge. Slide the dough and tart pan bottom off the
edge of the work surface, placing a hand under the metal bottom,
and lower it into the outer ring of the tart pan. Press the dough
against the sides of the pan and trim the overhang.
</P>
<P>
   Cover the dough with a sheet of aluminum foil and weight it with
some rice or dried beans. Place the tart pan in the preheated oven
and bake for 10 minutes. Remove the foil with the rice or beans and
bake uncovered for another 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   While the crust is baking, make the filling. Put the eggs and
sugar in the bowl of a mixer. Beat at high speed until pale yellow
ribbons form, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce the speed of the mixer and
slowly pour in the orange juice.
</P>
<P>
   Pour the mixture into the baked crust and place the tart in the
oven. Bake until the top is browned and the filling appears firm
when the pan is shaken gently, about 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Allow the tart to cool completely before serving. I prefer it
after it has been chilled in the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 8 to 10.

A FALSE CHOICE ON GUNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president of the National Rifle
Association, must be frustrated to the point of distraction with
President Clinton's refusal to heel to the commands of the gun
lobby. How else to explain the outrageous accusation LaPierre made
on national television Sunday, that Clinton ``needs a certain level
of violence in this country'' to further his gun-control agenda?
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre's remark was just an overheated slice of the rhetoric
the NRA has been ratcheting up of late in an advertising campaign
featuring NRA President Charlton Heston. The ads accuse Clinton of
lying about the NRA's position on gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA is desperately trying to change the subject from
Clinton's call for reasonable gun-control measures to a debate on
better enforcement of existing gun laws. But this is a false
choice. In fact, Clinton's gun-control package calls for $280
million in new law enforcement personnel, including 1,100 state and
federal prosecutors and some 500 agents and inspectors for the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. There is no earthly
reason why sincere opponents of gun violence can't get behind both
tougher enforcement and broader prevention.
</P>
<P>
   A good example is the proposal to register all newly purchased
guns and license the owners, something the NRA vehemently rejects.
Registration would make it easier to trace guns used in crimes,
whether they have been stolen, carelessly sold, or traded through
the huge loopholes that filigree the nation's gun laws. Would such
a system be considered a prevention or enforcement measure? Does it
matter?
</P>
<P>
   The average citizen doesn't really care whether gun deaths among
children are declining due to Child Access Prevention laws that are
now in 17 states or because the Eddie Eagle program run by the NRA
is teaching school kids the safe way to handle rifles _ or whether
politicians are pandering to the suburban-woman or angry-male vote.
The state of violence in America is a state of emergency. The
correct course is whatever takes guns out of the wrong hands, and
getting there requires plenty of work from everyone.

DOCTORS REPAIR ANEURYSM FROM INSIDE BLOOD VESSEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bulging aorta running through William Olohan's abdomen had
reached a critical size: the weakened blood vessel could burst
fatally at any time and the risk was increasing. But the normal
operation to repair it is traumatic and might overburden the
61-year-old man's weakened heart.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tough call for the patient and doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you just have to bite the bullet'' and attempt the
major repair operation rather than leave the patient with a ticking
time bomb, said Dr. James Estes, a vascular surgeon at New England
Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   But now there's a new alternative _ a minimally invasive
procedure that doesn't require the large abdominal incision of the
standard operation, and doesn't cause the patient the postoperative
pain and many weeks of recovery. It's done by sliding an expandable
Dacron graft through a catheter into the aneurysm (the widened,
weak section of aorta), to replace the ballooned-out portion of the
vessel with a strong synthetic tube.
</P>
<P>
   Approved for wide use last year, the procedure _ endovascular
grafting for abdominal aortic aneurysm _ could be done on many of
the thousands of people who need the repair. It's estimated that
1.5 million Americans have this type of aneurysm, but because
they're often asymptomatic until the aneurysms get dangerously
large, only about 200,000 are diagnosed. Some 15,000 die from
ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms each year.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Einstein died from one in 1955 when he was 76.
</P>
<P>
   Surgeons at NEMC were among the first in the Boston area to
perform the procedure and have done about 10, said Estes. Several
other large Boston teaching hospitals also do the endovascular
repair.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Estes did the procedure on Olohan, guiding the
expandable Dacron graft, furled like an umbrella, through a large
catheter in the Stow, Mass. man's groin and into the weakened
section of aorta.
</P>
<P>
   The tubular graft looks like a piece of thin cloth with a ring
of tiny metal hooks at each end, and hardly looks high- tech: but
the cost of each graft is a whopping $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Using controls on the handle of the catheter, which looks like a
fishing rod, Estes got the collapsed graft to unfurl until it was a
tube about an inch in diameter and several inches long. At each end
of the graft the circle of metal hooks bites into the wall of the
healthy aorta above and below the weakened part, anchoring the
graft. Estes said the most critical part of the procedure is
ensuring there are no leaks at the upper part of the graft.
</P>
<P>
   Then the catheter is withdrawn, leaving the graft in place.
</P>
<P>
   Within 48 hours of the procedure, Olohan was home. Had he
undergone the standard operation, he would have spent at least 5 or
6 days in the hospital with a long scar on his abdomen, and would
have needed two or three months to recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am delighted to have it fixed,'' Olohan said Tuesday after
coming to NEMC for a routine post-surgical visit. ``I feel fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Another patient, Michael Knowles, 53, of New Bedford, Mass., had
the procedure on March 6 as an alternative to surgery because he
has diabetes and kidney failure. For him, recovery ws a breeze.
``I've had worse experiences in the dentist's chair,'' he said.
``It's incredible. It really is.''
</P>
<P>
   In the standard repair operation, surgeons work through a large
incision to replace the weakened, expanded part of the aorta with a
Dacron graft. There can be a variety of complications, and death in
about 4 percent of patients, Estes said. The endovascular graft
operation sometimes has to be abandoned if surgeons run into
problems or puncture an artery with the catheter; in such a case
they would quickly change to the standard operation.
</P>
<P>
   Although Olohan is 61, Estes said he would not ordinarily
recommend the new procedure for someone in that age range _ which
is considered young _ unless he or she had other health problems
that would make standard surgery too risky. The long-term
durability of the endovascular graft isn't yet known.
</P>
<P>
   Patients are already learning about the endovascular option from
the Internet and are demanding it from their doctors, said Dr.
Albert Hakaim, a vascular surgeon at the Mayo Clinic in
Jacksonville, Fla. ``Nationally, there's a big, patient-driven push
to offer the graft'' for abdominal aneuryms, said Hakaim, adding
that 32 have been performed at the clinic, with one death, which he
said was unrelated to the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Two endovascular devices have been approved by the US Food and
Drug Administration. The one implanted in Olohan at NEMC is made by
Guidant Corp. of Indianopolis; the other is made by Medtronic Inc.
of Minneapolis. Some centers, like the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville,
also use grafts they make themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The graft has to be sized exactly to mate with the patient's
blood vessels and to accommodate to individual anatomy. Before the
procedure is done, doctors inject a dye into the blood vessels and
take x-rays that reveal the exact location, size and configuration
of the aneurysm.
</P>
<P>
   Then, those measurements are sent to the companies, where a
graft is made to order.

 CHRON  
 Hobbs' Bacon Business Is Smokin': Economist's hobby turns
meats  into millions   By Janet Fletcher  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN RAFAEL, Calif. _  Twenty years ago, Hobbs Shore retired from a
career as an economist and moved to the sleepy west Marin town of
Marshall. But the tiny village proved to have even less of a pulse
than Shore imagined, and two years into retirement, he was
thoroughly bored.
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the urging of a commercial fisherman friend, Shore turned an
old refrigerator into a smoker and began smoking salmon and the
occasional ham or turkey for friends.
</P>
<P>
   One Monday morning, a few days after he had made some smoked
meats for a friend's dinner party, he got the call that brought
retirement to an abrupt end.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Bradley Ogden,'' said the caller, the chef-owner of
the Lark Creek Inn in Larkspur. ``Can I place an order?''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Hobbs Applewood Smoked Meat is a $4.5 million business
with customers from California to Florida's Disney World. Thomas
Keller of the French Laundry in Yountville calls Hobbs' bacon the
best in the world. Ogden uses 50 pounds of his ham hocks a week at
the Lark Creek Inn. Insalata's in San Anselmo, Bay Wolf and Caffe
817 in Oakland, and Bizou, Boulevard and Park Chow in San Francisco
are among the restaurants that have made Hobbs' name almost as
common on local menus as garlic. In an industry dominated by
meat-processing giants, Shore's experience reflects, in part, how a
small business can thrive by addressing Bay Area chefs' concerns
about how their raw materials are produced.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we use prosciutto at all, his is the one we use,'' says
Michael Wild of Bay Wolf. ``It's the one that's actually made by a
human being with some kind of care.''
</P>
<P>
   At Park Chow, where Hobbs' pepperoni tops the pizza, chef-owner
Tony Gulisano is another enthusiast. ``We can't touch the pepperoni
pizza,'' Gulisano says. ``It's really, really good. It's so clean
when you eat it, it feels healthful. It feels like you've eaten
food that's been taken care of. Let alone all the love that (Shore)
puts into it. I believe you can taste that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   For a 78-year-old who says the best part of his business is
hanging out with chefs, the approval of these demanding clients is
a huge ego boost. When Keller, who reportedly has time for no one,
stands around with him in the French Laundry kitchen debating
whether to put truffle oil on Hobbs' bundnerfleisch, Shore is in
heaven. When he recalls bringing liverwurst to Boulevard's Nancy
Oakes and watching her and her staff eat it all on the spot, his
elfin face lights up with delight.
</P>
<P>
   Although his second career as a  &LR; charcutier &LR;  happened by chance,
in a sense Shore had trained for it since childhood. Raised in the
Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn, with Italian, French, Swedish and
Norwegian neighbors, he grew up eating Italian coppa and French
saucisson when neighborhood families would gather on the sandlot
for meals. ``It was a quiltwork of Europeans,'' he says, ``and we
were all poor in those days.''
</P>
<P>
   To get him out of the city in the summers and away from polio
epidemics, his parents sent their young son to his grandfather's
farm in upstate New York. There, the first summer, he anticipated
weeks of swimming, sunning and fishing. But his Norwegian
grandfather put him to work in his smokehouse, moving the apple
wood-filled smoke wagon around so the bacon, hams and fish smoked
evenly.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a vacation,'' Shore says ruefully. ``I thought, I'll
never look another smokehouse in the face again.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he helped his grandfather for eight summers, and
although he never liked doing it and never thought he had learned
anything, he would sporadically smoke a ham or some fish in
adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Ogden called to say he had tasted Shore's meats at
a dinner party, the phone rang again. Kelly Mills, then the chef at
the Clift Hotel, had been at the same party. Would Shore sell him
some bacon?
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I don't do this,' '' Shore recalls. He was supposed
to be retired, spending time with his wife. She would surely resent
it if he launched a little sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I went to my wife,'' Shore recalls, ``and said, `Would it
be OK if maybe a couple of times a week I went to the city?' And
she said, `Thank God. You're driving me crazy.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Today he makes around four dozen different products in his
Oakland facility, all in small amounts and almost all for the
restaurant trade. (See ``Finding Hobbs'' for the few retail stores
that carry at least some of his products.) He has no sales force;
his business grows each year by word of mouth and the inevitable
migration of chefs from job to job. No special request is too small
if it intrigues him. When chef Laurent Manrique joined Campton
Place and wanted Toulouse-style sausage for his cassoulet, Shore
turned to his childhood taste memories of Bensonhurst and created
one. The liverwurst, which he makes when the mood strikes,
apparently never makes it past the chef.
</P>
<P>
   To guarantee the quality of his main ingredient, Shore gets his
pork from a small Canadian family farm. He is the farm's only
customer and the pigs are raised to his specifications. During
their final weeks, the animals are fed barley instead of mash to
give the meat a tighter grain, and the leaner the animal's fatback,
the more Shore pays. American pigs are too large and the meat
inconsistent, he says. When the price goes down, farmers hold the
hogs off the market and continue to feed them, waiting for a better
price, so when the hogs finally reach market, they're too fat.
</P>
<P>
   The other crucial ingredient in his recipe, Shore believes, is
his hands-on approach. ``You can't let machines get between you and
the product,'' he says. It is sight, touch, taste and smell _ not a
formula _ that tells him when the prosciutto or air-dried salami is
right.
</P>
<P>
   Each of Hobbs' chef-customers has a favorite among his growing
repertoire. Heidi Krahling, chef-owner of Insalata's, loves the
Iberian air-dried chorizo, which she uses in cataplana, a Spanish
clam, sausage and tomato dish. Wild waxes poetic about the smoked
ham hocks, which his kitchen pairs with fava beans in the spring
and fresh lima beans in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the most delicate, absolutely pristine,'' Wild says.
``Most of the hocks you find here are frozen and oversmoked and
taste like chemicals. These are sweet and succulent, like those
little hocks in France that you never see here.''
</P>
<P>
   At Caffe 817, owner Sandro Rossi makes a charcuterie plate with
Hobbs' soppressata, coppa, mortadella and prosciutto, sliced to
order and served with house-cured baby artichokes. He puts the
prosciutto cotto in a garbanzo soup with spinach, and serves Hobbs'
whiskey-fennel sausages with polenta.
</P>
<P>
   Gulisano likes the herb and garlic pork loin, which goes on a
Park Chow sandwich with caramelized onions and Crescenza cheese.
Shore showed him how to steam the meat briefly to release the
juices, the way delis do in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The company may have no sales force, but the genial Shore
relishes his kitchen visits, and chefs profess a fondness for him
that surpasses the typical supplier-chef bond.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the kind of man that, when he comes in, you want to get
him a slice of pie and a cup of coffee,'' says Boulevard's Oakes,
whose husband is rival sausagemaker Bruce Aidells. Her sausage
business goes elsewhere, of course, but she uses a lot of Hobbs'
bacon and his ``smoky and mysterious'' Westphalian ham, which she
calls the best American substitute for prosciutto.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's sort of like a mad scientist, father and great supporter
all rolled into one,'' Krahling says. ``When he comes into the
kitchen, he ponies up next to you and talks and gives you pearls of
wisdom. He's just a magical man.''

   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup red wine
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup red wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves, peeled and smashed
</P>
<P>
   1 sprig fresh thyme
</P>
<P>
   2 shallots, minced
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste

</P>
<P>
   4 slices pancetta, cut like thick-sliced bacon
</P>
<P>
   2 eggs
</P>
<P>
   2 bunches young dandelion greens, thick stems removed
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the wine, vinegar, 1 garlic clove and the thyme in a
small saucepan. Simmer over moderate heat until reduced to 1/3 cup.
</P>
<P>
   Put the shallots in a bowl and pour the hot wine mixture over
them. Season with salt and pepper and let macerate for 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a small saute pan over moderate
heat. Add the remaining garlic clove and saute until the oil is
fragrant, then discard the garlic. Toss the bread cubes with the
oil, then arrange on a baking sheet. Bake until golden and crisp,
about 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Place the pancetta in a saute pan and cook over moderate heat
until some of the fat renders; do not let the pancetta crisp.
Transfer the pancetta to paper towels to drain, then break into
smaller pieces; set aside. Reserve the fat in the pan.
</P>
<P>
   Place the eggs (in their shells) in a small saucepan; add water
to cover. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and let stand for 6
minutes. Drain, peel and cut in half.
</P>
<P>
   Finish the vinaigrette by whisking in the reserved pancetta fat.
If the vinaigrette is still too acidic, add olive oil to taste.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To assemble the salad:  &LR; Gently heat a large stainless-steel
bowl over moderately low heat. Add some of the vinaigrette (you
will not need it all), then the pancetta and greens. Toss until the
greens are wilted, adding more vinaigrette if needed; add the
croutons and toss again. Taste and adjust seasoning.
</P>
<P>
   Serve warm, garnishing each portion with an egg half.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.

 Pssst! Wanna Buy a Twinkie? Why America nurses a secret
passion  for junk food   By Kim Severson  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _   `What's that sizzling sound I hear? Get Up! 
 It's Spam and eggs, my dear!'' _  Advertising slogan from the
1940s.
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
San Francisco nightclub owner Harry Denton's devil is a quart of
cold whole milk and a package of Hostess Sno Balls. Pink or white,
doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   John Kowalski, a 37-year-old chemist from San Francisco, has a
hidden passion for Kraft macaroni and cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Fararo, 42, is a Berkeley free-lance journalist who is so
picky about food that she'll only drink lattes from Alice Water's
Cafe Fanny. But some afternoons, when no one is looking, she stirs
up a pot of chicken-flavored Rice-A-Roni.
</P>
<P>
   They are not alone. The Bay Area has a secret palate for
processed all-American junk. Sure, we make fun of Spam and sneer at
Velveeta. But we suck them down at astounding rates. Finding a
person raised in the United States who isn't secretly fond of some
sort of junk food is as hard as finding an Italian who doesn't like
pasta.
</P>
<P>
   Says Fararo: ``Everybody's got their Rice-A-Roni.''
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   It's quite a paradox. America is a country of health-obsessed
exercise fanatics. The government spends billions of dollars
wrangling with the safety and purity of the food supply. American
restaurants boast some of the best chefs in the world, yet 500
million Twinkies are consumed each year.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the hallowed halls of academia, the love of junk food
runs deep. In dining halls at the University of California at
Berkeley, the food service staff met resistance when they tried to
break the student body's 1,200-servings-a-week Jell-O habit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to take it off the menu for a little variety and it
was like, `Hey, where's the Jell-O?' '' says dining service
director Nancy Jurich. The favorite flavor? Blueberry.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason may be that we're a country affluent enough
to eat whatever we want. But a stronger draw is the reason people
like Kowalski put a box of Hostess Ho-Hos in his cart when he
shopped at Safeway in San Francisco's Diamond Heights district
earlier this month. ``I always picture my Mom packing my lunch
every time I eat these,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Nostalgia is a powerful force in choosing the food we eat, says
Syracuse University professor Robert Thompson, president of the
4,000-member Popular Culture Association. And in a nation as young
and rootless as America, icons that bring us back to our past are
revered, even if they are full of fat, sugar and chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids eat this stuff simply because it tastes good,'' he says.
``Then when they grow up and eat a Twinkie, every bite is like a
piece of their childhood. A Ho-Ho isn't just a little snack; it's a
special friend.''
</P>
<P>
   But we can't explain away Spam, Twinkies and Jell-O as pure
nostalgia. ``Nearly all the classic processed food offers something
else besides just food,'' he says. ``Jiffy Pop is dramatic
entertainment. Jell-O is the texture of children's playthings. Spam
is a food that could be eaten anywhere on this or any other planet.
This stuff is fun. It's magic.''
</P>
<P>
   Junk food is easy on the brain and perfect for people who think
instant gratification takes too long, says Marc Halperin of the
Center for Culinary Development in San Francisco. ``The Twinkie is
soft, it's sweet, it's moist, it fills your mouth and your stomach
very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Halperin admits an occasional indulgence in French crullers and
A &AMP; W root beer floats, although not necessarily at the same time.
``Donuts and Spam don't require a lot of cogitation. You don't need
to think about what you're eating.''
</P>
<P>
   For Denton of the Starlight Room, junk food offers a certain
naughty appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a comfort food and it's the devil in everybody,'' he
says. ``No one wants to be perfect, so it's good when you want to
be a little bad.''
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   For chefs who place a high value on seasonal and regional
ingredients and who likely wouldn't be caught dead with a Ho-Ho,
how all this stuff got on grocery store shelves in the first place
is the question.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Rodgers at Zuni Cafe is among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says something about the commercial evolution of this
country,'' she says, adding that America may have been ripe for
junk food because it didn't have the deep-seated cultural roots of
Asian or European countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``In France, homemade mayonnaise dies a little harder,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the story of modern American junk food encompasses
100 years of history, culture, science and technology. Many of the
foods we hate to love have their roots in early mechanical and
preservation advances like canning. Borden, for example, started
canning milk in 1860. J.L. Kraft company began canning cheese in
1914, and Velveeta was introduced in 1928. Hormel started canning
ham in 1926 and 11 years later gave birth to Spam.
</P>
<P>
   Those shelf-stable products turned out to be handy for feeding
soldiers, and both world wars served to imprint certain canned
foods on the American palate. Residents of Hawaii, where more Spam
is eaten per capita than any other state, can trace their love of
the product back to World War II. To this day, Spam sushi can be
purchased almost everywhere in Hawaii, including 7-Elevens.
</P>
<P>
   The advent of mass-market advertising also helped sear certain
products into America's collective consciousness. By the 1940s,
radio jingles had become became the thing, and products like Spam
sponsored popular shows like Burns and Allen.
</P>
<P>
   The next leap in fast food came in the '50s, when television,
advances in chemical research and a fascination with science all
took hold of America. Between 1949 and 1959, chemists came up with
more than 400 additives to help foods survive increasingly complex
mass production techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone searching for the perfect food icon for the '50s might
look to the TV dinner. Swanson trademarked its first _ turkey and
mashed potatoes _ in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the Baby Boom was in full effect. Settling in and
raising a family was the nation's preoccupation. Women were
beginning to enter the work force and a whole slew of new
``modern'' kitchen appliances and foods fed the country's
fascination with convenience.
</P>
<P>
   In the late '60s and early '70s, innovation and grabbing market
share gave the junk food market a hard twist. Goofy, gimmicky food,
like Funyuns and Ding Dongs, crowded the market. Ethnic influences
also made their way into junk food circles, with pork rinds and
nacho-flavored Doritos gaining popularity.
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward to 2000. Despite the growth of the organic foods
industry and the demonstrable connection between diet and health,
not to mention the battle over genetically engineered foods,
Chee-tos and Hostess Cupcakes continue to fill grocery store carts.
</P>
<P>
   It's a cycle that may take generations to break. Or it may be
that junk food is such a part of the American diet and culture that
it will never die. Junk food encompasses America's triumphs in war,
commerce and technology _ underpinnings of the nation's culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that this stuff is bite-sized America,''
Professor Thompson says. ``It is the American myth there for the
taking. A good bite of a Twinkie is a profound American
tradition.''
</P>

<P>
   _  &UR; Twinkies &LR;  were born in 1930, when Continental Baking Co.
manager James Dewar of Illinois decided Depression-idled baking
pans might be used to create a cheap snack. He took the name from
an ad for Twinkle Toe Shoes, and charged a nickel for a pack of
two. The original filling was banana cream, which was abandoned for
vanilla during the banana shortage of 1940.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Spam &LR; , the first meat product that did not need
refrigeration, was invented by Hormel in 1937, but it really came
into its own during World War II. The military liked it because it
was shelf-stable, and consumers could have their fill because it
wasn't rationed like beef.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Jell-O &LR;  was born in 1897 when New York cough syrup
manufacturer Pearl Wait adapted Charles Knox's patent for gelatin
sheets into a sweet, fruit-flavored dessert and called it Jell-O,
after Grain-O, a popular coffee substitute. Wait sold the patent to
his neighbor, orator Francis Woodward, for $450; Woodward turned
Jell-0 into a million-dollar empire. Today, Jell-O manufacturer
General Foods Co. estimates that 13 boxes are sold every second.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Velveeta &LR;  grew out of the process for making the canned
cheese that nourished American troops in World War I. It was
launched by Kraft in 1928 with the slogan, ``Digestible as Milk
Itself!'' Kraft's Macaroni and Cheese Dinner followed in 1937, then
the Kraft Deluxe processed cheese slices in 1950, and Cheez Whiz in
1952.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Wonder Bread &LR;  got its name in 1921 when Taggert Baking Co.
executive Elmer Cline saw hundreds of balloons fill the sky and was
filled with, well, wonder. A decade later, sliced loaves were
introduced and a great clich &LR; e &LR;  was invented. In 1940, the Food and
Drug Administration mandated that vitamins like iron and thiamine
be added to white flour. Wonder Bread's vitamin-enriched formula
and slogan _ it ``helps build strong bodies'' _ remain popular
today.

   With his latest film, ``Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,''
formalist wiseacre Jim Jarmusch (``Stranger Than Paradise,'' ``Dead
Man'') attempts to blend gangster, hip-hop, cartoon and Japanese
action-movie elements into one poker-faced satiric hybrid. It's a
fundamentally fun idea that doesn't mesh very well with the
filmmaker's detached, cooler-than-thou aesthetic attitude. As a
result, the film's pleasures are more theoretical than actual.
</P>
<P>
   Jarmusch's signature cross-wiring of cultural references gets a
real workout in this story of a decrepit Mafia family's run-in with
an African-American hit man who fancies himself a latter-day
samurai warrior. Basically, the film is about the clash of two
different, violent ethics, but it's also about all things running
their course. Set in a generic, post-industrial urban blightscape,
the movie unfolds at the speed _ and, even at its funniest, with
the tone _ of a funeral procession.
</P>
<P>
   Which is appropriate, since the upshot of all this has less to
do with contrasting themes and imagery than with making a lot of
dead bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Portly, putty-faced Forest Whitaker is the unlikely title
assassin. An ascetic, silent type who lives in a shack atop a
tenement next to his pigeon coop, Ghost Dog's life, like any good
samurai's, is devoted to serving his master.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, said lord is an aging mob underling named Louie
(John Tormey), who saved Dog from an awful beating many years
earlier. Though he doesn't quite know what to make of this strange
guy who so willingly and effectively carries out requested hits,
Louie is happy to use him anyway.
</P>
<P>
   However, when a small glitch mars an otherwise perfect contract
killing, Louie's bosses order the Dog killed. This, of course,
proves easier said than done; after huffing and puffing their way
up flights of stairs, the family's gray-haired mooks barely have
enough energy left to pull triggers on the various pigeon-keepers
they mistake for their elusive prey.
</P>
<P>
   Dog, meanwhile, combines his ancient fighting skills and high-
tech arsenal in a war of attrition against the new set of enemies,
while all the time trying to stay loyal to Louie. As any soldier
will tell you, there's a lot of downtime between battles, which Dog
spends bonding with a little girl in the park and having
conversations he doesn't understand with a French-speaking ice
cream vendor.
</P>
<P>
   The mobsters, meanwhile, indulge the usual movie made-guy
eccentricities: Sonny (Cliff Gorman) digs that funky rap music the
most; godfather Ray (Henry Silva) makes fun of people's names and
tries to get his face to work; the jokers can't make the rent on
their headquarters; and they all watch cartoons too much.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this is funny, some of it just fills space, all of it
takes too long. To remind us that we're looking at a movie instead
of a still life, Jarmusch keeps throw ing triple exposures,
superimpo sitions, editing stutters and other cinematic
attention-getters into the mix. In the plus column, he also comes
up with a good half- dozen inventive visuals (the great Robby
Muller shot the film). And the syncopated soundtrack by Wu-Tang
Clan leader THE RZA is the movie's most reliably lively element.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Ghost Dog'' isn't about life, however obsessed its
principles may be with the codes they live by. Practically
everybody we meet here is dead on first contact; it just takes a
long time for the realization to become final. &QL;

<P>
   Erin Brockovich, legal assistant extraordinaire, has an uncanny
way of digging up information that would elude the most experienced
lawyers and the best private detectives. Her boss, Ed Masry, a
disheveled attorney nearing the end of his career, wonders just how
Brockovich does it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how these places are run,'' Masry says. ``They're a
mess. What makes you think you can just walk in there and find what
you need?''
</P>
<P>
   Answers Brockovich: ``They're called boobs, Ed.''
</P>
<P>
   Julia Roberts' boobs _ along with her considerable charisma _
are on fine display in ``Erin Brockovich,'' an enjoyable lark of a
movie that finds director Steven Soderbergh working hard to deliver
crowd-pleasing entertainment. And while the movie certainly
delivers a rousing good time, it never comes close to being
believable as a true story. And the problem isn't in the film's
facts, which are close enough by Hollywood standards, but in the
way Roberts' imposing presence subverts what is essentially a
David-and-Goliath tale.
</P>
<P>
   Brockovich begins the movie as a twice-divorced mother of three
young children who's desperate for work. She eventually lands at
the law offices of Masry (Albert Finney), who once represented her
(unsuccessfully). Masry gives Brockovich a clerical job after she
threatens to make a scene. Making scenes is what Brockovich does
best; Masry at one point tells her that charm school, not law
school, would be of greatest benefit to her personal growth.
</P>
<P>
   Brockovich's attitude and her appearance (all the plunging
necklines, push-up bras and leather mini-skirts makes it look like
Roberts' has raided her ``Pretty Woman'' wardrobe trunk) don't
exactly endear her to her female co-workers. She calls one
overweight woman ``Krispy Kreme'' and reduces others to shocked
silence with various risque put-downs.
</P>
<P>
   A higher calling eventually arrives when Brockovich begins
investigating health problems afflicting families in the California
desert community of Hinkley. Brockovich traces the illnesses to a
deadly chemical that Pacific Gas and Electric used in its local
plant. Employing nothing more than her street smarts and
conspicuous cleavage, Brockovich begins to gather damning evidence,
pressing Masry to take the case to trial.
</P>
<P>
   The facts of the case make ``Erin Brockovich'' sound like the re
cent tepid legal drama ``A Civil Action,'' but this movie is more
like ``Norma Rae'' anchored in underwire. There are the requi site
scenes of lives that have been ravaged by corporate greed (Marg
Helgenberger and Cherry Jones have some nice moments), but they're
overshadowed by Brockovich's coming-of-age tale.
</P>
<P>
   And that's not necessarily a bad thing. Certainly, we've had
enough solemn and teary court room theatrics in movies to last us a
lifetime. Soderbergh, work ing from a snappy screenplay by Susannah
Grant (with an un credited rewrite by Richard LaGravanese), seems
to under stand this, and ignores most of the genre's cliches. The
result is an energetic, briskly directed, knockabout effort that
tells its story in a different, although hardly unique, way.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts and Finney make a great team, and an unrecognizable
Aaron Eckhart also has some potent chemistry with Roberts, playing
Brockovich's biker boy friend who becomes a full-time baby sitter
to her kids.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts' star power is what you'll remember most, though, which
is both the movie's greatest strength and its one glaring weakness.
Roberts is at ease with the film's comic and dra matic requirements
and she's at her romantic best with Eckhart. But we never forget
she's Julia Roberts. It all makes for a great Julia Roberts movie,
but an iffy biopic, which is a little discon certing for a movie
called ``Erin Brockovich.'' &QL;

 &HT;    PTEK unit invests in BuyTrek, capitalizing on e-commerce surge
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ PTEK Holdings, a company recently reshaped and
renamed, has made yet another investment in a small but ambitious
high-tech start-up.
</P>
<P>
   The company also announced fourth-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   PTEK subsidiary PTEK Ventures has led a $2.5 million
institutional investment round in BuyTrek, plunking down about $2
million for a piece of an Atlanta-based company that aims to
capitalize on the surge of interest in electronic commerce via the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   BuyTrek's plan is to provide visitors to a Web site with a
system for Web shopping. When a buyer searches for an item, BuyTrek
takes the consumer to the item they are looking for within a
merchant's site. BuyTrek then will allow the buyer to view the same
item at other sites, enabling the user to compare.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are excited to make BuyTrek the latest addition to our
rapidly growing network of Internet-based companies,'' said Boland
T. Jones, PTEK Holdings founder, chairman and chief executive. ``We
are confident that the company has the technical expertise,
executive leadership and industry knowledge to achieve tremendous
success.''
</P>
<P>
   PTEK, which until February was known as Premiere Technologies,
was itself once a hot, high-tech up-and-comer. The company ran into
some trouble after making a series of acquisitions. Its stock value
fell, along with its earnings. The company lost money through most
of the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   PTEK reported revenue Tuesday of $114.9 million for the fourth
quarter of 1999 compared with $116.9 million during the same period
a year earlier. PTEK reported an operating loss of $32.4 million
compared with $41.7 million. The company reported net income of
$1.23 basic earnings per share in contrast with a
79-cents-per-share loss during the same quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding gains from the sale of investments or one-time
charges, the company lost 68 cents per share in the last quarter,
compared with a 52-cents-per-share loss in the fourth quarter of
1998.
</P>
<P>
   The company is now split in four: PTEK Ventures, as well as
units for fax business, messaging and phone conferencing.
</P>
<P>
   The PTEK Ventures Portfolio includes Healtheon/WebMD,
VerticalOne, USA.Net, Derivion, S1 Corp., Webforia and i2Go.com.
The company recently ran a contest in which SingleShop.com, IKimbo,
Chutney and WorldWideTesting won the rights to a PTEK investment,
but terms are still being negotiated.

   TV-AUDREY-HEPBURN (Hollywood) _ For an actress who epitomized
American cool, Audrey Hepburn is inspiring a lot of nervous sweat.
In life, her fragile beauty and elegantly pared-down fashion sense
made her one of the most distinctive, most admired stars on the
Hollywood screen. And that is precisely the problem. ``People are
very protective of Audrey Hepburn,'' said Susan Lyne, executive
vice president for movies and mini-series at ABC, which will
broadcast ``The Audrey Hepburn Story'' this month. ``They worry
that someone will come along and try to besmirch her reputation.
It's not like doing the Marilyn Monroe story where people are
salaciously interested in every misstep she took.'' The drama,
starring Jennifer Love Hewitt, will be shown on Monday, March 27.
By Bernard Weinraub. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TV-HEWITT-HEPBURN (Undated) _ While Jennifer Love Hewitt, who
will star as Audrey Hepburn on March 27 in ``The Audrey Hepburn
Story,'' has considerable charm and her talent have been
corroborated by an astonishing number of teen-zine cover stories,
the portrayal by a popular young actress of a show business
original like a Hepburn, and Hepburn, can only result in lobsided
comparisons. It seems to me that the outcome of viewing something
like this will be to increase our longing for the genuine article
at the expense of our regard for the woman playing her. By Jeff
MacGregor. &QL;

   VIRGIL-THOMSON-MUSIC (New York) _ To a devoted core of admirers,
including this critic, ``The Mother of Us All'' by Virgil Thomson,
which comes to the New York City Opera this Sunday afternoon in a
new production by Christopher Alden first unveiled at the
Glimmerglass Opera in 1998, is the most original and arguably the
greatest of American operas. In a 1984 article in The New Yorker,
Andrew Porter, an infuential critic and opera scholar not known for
a casual use of superlatives, stated that every time he heard ``The
Mother of Us All'' he was ``tempted to consider it the best of all
American operas'' and, on calm reflection, would ``hardly modify
that beyond `one of the three best.''' By Anthony Tommasini. WITH

   REGGIO-FILMS (New York) _ Godfrey Reggio is an alien who wants
to destroy the future from within. At least, that is what he says.
And the funny thing is that the reclusive 59-year-old filmmaker
makes a beguiling sort of sense as he arranges his far-reaching
abstractions about humanity's high-tech dilemmas into pleasant
conversation, much as films like ``Koyaanisqatsi'' and
``Powaqqatsi'' string together pearls of staggering imagery into
artful condemnations of Western civilization. By Ty Burr. WITH

</P>
<P>
   BLACK-MALES-OSCAR (Undated) _ It's been nearly 40 years since
the first time an African-American man won the best-actor Oscar.
And in the long, parched stretch of desert since the night Sidney
Poitier got the statuette for his 1963 starring role in ``Lilies of
the Field,'' no other black male has received an Oscar for best
actor. Lately, if you were a black man looking for an Oscar
nomination, you had to go to prison. Both of this year's nominees,
Denzel Washington in the best-actor category for ``The Hurricane''
and Michael Clarke Duncan in the best-supporting group for ``The
Green Mile,'' spend time as convicts in their films. By Elvis
Mitchell. &QL;

<P>
   CRUDUP-FILMS (Undated) _ So far, most of the articles about
Billy Crudup, 31, _ and there have been a bunch since his 1995
Broadway debut as the heart-piercing tutor in ``Arcadia'' _ have
noted the pronunciation of his name. CREW-dup. CRUDE-up. KROO-dup.
And they have predicted that any time now, any time at all, the
name would become as familiar as DiCaprio or Damon or Affleck: that
the bitter college ladykiller he played in ``Inventing the
Abbotts'' (1997) or the star-crossed runner he played in ``Without
Limits'' (1998) or the pining cowboy he played in ``The Hi-Lo
Country'' (1998) would make him a star. Well, here they come again.
This time, the movie is ``Waking the Dead,'' based on Scott
Spencer's novel about an up-and-coming politician haunted by
intertwined memories of lost love and abandoned ideals. By Sylviane

   MAJIDI-FILMS (New York) _ On a sunny Friday afternoon last fall,
the director Majid Majidi, in town for the New York Film Festival
from his native Tehran, was in demand. Negotiations for the
American distribution of his latest film, ``The Color of
Paradise,'' which opens March 31, were under way. Earlier in the
week reporters had been talking with him about Iranian films, about
why they are so often about children and what it is like making
films under censorship. By Friday, Majidi was in Cliffside, N.J.,
at the home of a friend, Jamsheed Akrami, a professor of film and
television at William Paterson University in Wayne, who was
interviewing him for a documentary. The festival circuit is nothing
new to this soft-spoken, sad-eyed 40-year-old director. His last
film, ``Children of Heaven,'' was the first Iranian film ever
nominated for an Academy Award. By Nancy Ramsey. &QL;

   TIBET-FILMS (Undated) _ Considering the Hollywood versions of
Tibet and Buddhist monks, Jamyang Norbu, a Tibetan immigrant and
writer living in Tennessee, considers ``The Cup,'' which opened in
late January, to be a fresh breeze. In it young monks break the
rules, sneaking out at night and snickering over Victoria's Secret
catalogues and snapping wisecracks during kitchen duty. ``It has a
sense of fun and a sense of reality,'' Norbu said. The director of
``The Cup,'' Khyentse Norbu, a high-ranking Buddhist lama from
Bhutan (who is no relation to Jamyang Norbu), knows the foibles of
young monks well, having taught in monasteries in Bhutan and India
for years. ``The romantic idea should stop now,'' Khyentse Norbu
said. ``In the West, people have higher expectations and see
Tibetans as holy and high _ people who don't eat and sleep. Sooner
or later, they're going to be disappointed. I'm trying to demystify
Tibetans.'' By Barbara Stewart. &QL;

which as a rule probably saves them disappointment, but every so
often a revelation comes along. A case in point: the Ukrainian
juggler Viktor Kee, 29, currently in San Francisco through next
Sunday with Cirque du Soleil's extravaganza, ``Dralion.'' His act
involves seven solid plastic balls, hand-molded by the artist
himself, which he not only sends flying in arcs that amaze the eye

   ELTON-JOHN-AIDA (New York) _ No one was selling peanuts, and
instead of metal bars there were velvet ropes, but Elton John, the
evening's prize peacock, was being ogled as surely as if he were in
a zoo. It was Dec. 9, 1999, the opening-night performance of
Disney's ``Aida'' in Chicago _ a little more than three months
before the Broadway opening this Thursday at the Palace Theater.
The gawkers lined up, and watched, as if John was on the television
screen in their own homes. That is a by-product of celebrity, of
course. It's just that some of those gawkers also happened to be in
the cast or on the staff of ``Aida'' and they wanted a look, too.

Solti leading the Vienna Philharmonic and a cast headed by Birgit
Nilsson, Hans Hotter and Wolfgang Windgassen. More than three

eight minutes of tangled allusions to the icons of the turbulent
1960s, offered by Don McLean in a collegiate folkie's warble, have

drawings of the ``Female Sampson'' (Angela d'Atalie, 1873) to
artfully staged photographs of ebony-skinned musclewomen by Andres
Serrano (with paintings, sculptures and comic book covers in

<P>
   THOM-MAYNE-ARCH (Undated) _ Like other architects of his
generation, Thom Mayne has resisted the idea of beauty. He has
evidently considered it a seductive idea that, like Circe,
threatens to take away a big guy's strength. So I am happy to
report that the strength of the new Diamond Ranch High School,
designed by Mayne and his firm Morphosis for the city of Pomona,
California, lies precisely in the beauty it brings to an already
spectacular hilltop site east of Los Angeles. By Herbert Muschamp. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SUBURBIA-PHOTOGS (Undated) _ Considered a groundbreaking
exemplar of documentary photography upon its publication in 1972,
``Suburbia'' later went out of print, dropping off the radar in
much the same way its creator, Bill Owens, did. By the end of that
decade _ after showing at institutions like the Museum of Modern
Art and the Smithsonian, winning major awards and producing two
more books _ he decided he could no longer raise a family on a
photographer's wages and quit the art world. Now ``Suburbia'' is
available in a new edition, with a foreword by the journalist and
social historian David Halberstam, published late last year by
Fotofolio. And Owens, today better known as an authority on brewing
beer, is suddenly in vogue again, showing in major galleries from
New York to Paris and, through April 2, in a retrospective at the
San Jose Museum of Art in San Jose, Calif. By Jeffrey Kastner. &QL;

U.N. CHIEF ASSESSES BENEFITS TO IRAQ OF OIL-FOR-FOOD PROGRAM

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Iraq has raised more than $13 billion for food,
medicines and other vital supplies under a U.N. plan that allows it
to sell some oil under international sanctions, says a report that
Secretary-General Kofi Annan sent to the Security Council on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   From December 1996 until December 1999, Iraq sold more than $20
billion worth of oil under the restricted sales program to meet the
most urgent needs of its citizens. Since December, as a gesture to
Iraq, there has been no ceiling on Iraqi exports, and billions of
dollars in additional imports are already on order, no longer
limited to food and medicine. A Security Council sanctions
committee also has relinquished oversight of imports of essentials
like food, medicines and basic educational and agricultural
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some persistent problems, the money has rolled in,
inflated by record oil prices, and Iraq's orders have become more
ambitious, often including heavy equipment for large infrastructure
projects. But as the range of purchases has expanded, more
contracts face tougher scrutiny by the Security Council sanctions
committee, particularly by the United States, which has delayed
approval of nearly 1,000 contracts. Annan's report looks for ways
to minimize these holds, which tie up hundreds of millions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The report is scheduled to be debated by the Security Council on
March 24.
</P>
<P>
   This is a critical moment in U.N. relations with Iraq, and the
success or failure of the oil sales program plays an important role
in the debate over how long sanctions imposed in 1990 after Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait can be maintained, diplomatically, or even
morally, in the view of some diplomats. Iraq is stepping up its
efforts to portray the sanctions as unacceptably inhumane as a new
U.N. chief arms inspector, Hans Blix of Sweden, prepares a new
inspection system that will again require the Iraqis to cooperate
or face a continued embargo.
</P>
<P>
   Blix will have to travel to Iraq in coming months to determine
his program of work. So far, the Iraqis have given no indication
that they will allow him to make the trip.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on Monday, Sergey Lavrov, Russia's
representative at the United Nations, who is frequently seen as
being closest to the Iraqis, gave the Iraqis no encouragement but
instead took a conciliatory stand toward those who are more
suspicious of President Saddam Hussein. He said that Russia was not
proposing to exempt the Iraqis from accountability even though he
abstained in the Security Council when the new inspection system
was created.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must be convinced that there can be no threat of weapons of
mass destruction coming from Iraq,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He added that he understood that the holds placed on Iraqi
orders often arose because of a dearth of technical information
about the goods being purchased, and he said he would not deny that
Russian companies were among those that have not provided adequate
details.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, officials say they are also looking for ways to
speed up the import-approval process for the Iraqis, but they
remain suspicious that Iraq will hide purchases that could go into
secret arms programs. American diplomats say that 85 percent to 90
percent of Iraqi purchases eventually go through, however.
</P>
<P>
   In his report, Annan spread the blame for orders that have been
put on hold but referred again and again to the negative impact
they have. Contractors are often vague, he said, and the Iraqis do
not always sign and submit contracts expeditiously. U.N. agencies
working in Iraq do not enforce rules about the proper submission of
contracts, he wrote, giving them until Aug. 31 to improve their
procurement procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Annan was critical of the failure of the Security Council to
approve an increase to $600 million from $300 million for spare
parts for Iraq's disintegrating oil industry, which has become an
environmental hazard, say independent experts hired by the United
Nations. Oil production will soon be unsustainable at present
levels, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Without prompt action, a continued decline in production is
strongly indicated,'' Annan wrote. That would ultimately mean less
money for civilian needs. If the price of oil should fall, the
damage would be far worse.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In listing the successes of the oil-sales program, Annan pointed
to the rising caloric value of basic foods provided and the
introduction of dairy products in the ``food basket'' supplied to
24 million Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   In health care, Annan noted that while there were still
shortcomings in water and sanitation, ``bacteriological analyses in
1999 showed drops of between 20 and 90 percent in contamination in
all but two of the 15 governates,'' the Iraqi equivalent of a
province or state, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of new medical equipment has led to a quadrupling of
X-ray examinations in three years, the United Nations found.
``Likewise, as drugs became more widely available at all levels of
health facilities,'' the report said, ``patient attendance
increased by 46 percent and some 90 percent of the essential drug
needs of the hospitals were met.''
</P>
<P>
   As in past reports, the United Nations found that the most
improvement in nutrition levels and the greatest advances against
water-borne diseases occurred in the largely autonomous Kurdish
areas of northern Iraq, where about 3 million people live beyond
the day-to-day control of Hussein's government. International
agencies are in direct charge of aid there.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In those areas _ the governates of Dohuk, Erbil and Sulaymaniyah
_ reforestation projects have begun and advances in agriculture
have been capped with the opening of three food-processing
factories making tomato paste, fruit juices, vegetable oil and
dairy products.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Despite advances in Iraq, the oil-for-food plan has come under
sustained criticism from the last two administrators of the program
there, Denis Halliday and Hans von Sponeck, who have deemed it to
be too little too late for the people of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Annan cautions in his report that the program should not be
considered a development plan for Iraq, but rather an exceptional
and complicated project to fill gaps in Iraq's own public projects
because of the effects of sanctions. ``The program was never
intended to meet all the humanitarian needs and must be assessed in
that context,'' he said.

FOR QUEBEC, LANGUAGE DEFINES EVERYTHING  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ With French billboards dominating the skyline, French
prevailing in offices and boutiques, and tourism officials
promoting this city on the St. Lawrence as ``Paris without jet
lag,'' some Canadians argue that French North America is no longer
under siege. Almost 250 years after losing the Seven Years' War,
Quebecers can finally relax.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, polls indicate that popular support for making this
province a new nation has fallen to a new low, about 39 percent. A
recent student riot against a youth conference organized by the
province's separatist government suggested that young Quebecers are
more interested in jobs, dropout rates and cuts in education
budgets.
</P>
<P>
   But a battle this winter to get French-language Pokemon cards
for Quebec children and legal battles brewing this spring over
language laws reflect the fact that Quebec's French-speaking
majority continues to view itself as an oppressed minority. And as
English-rights proponents challenge mandatory French supremacy in
signs, workplaces and the yellow pages, some people fear a new
break in Canada's carefully maintained linguistic peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``In North America, we are only 2 percent,'' said Louise
Beaudoin, Quebec's language minister, who won the battle for
French-language Pokemon cards and Nintendo manuals. On Monday,
lawyers for the provincial government finished arguments appealing
a ruling by a Quebec judge that struck down a provincial sign law,
saying that French is no longer ``vulnerable'' in Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   In modern Quebec, where 6 million people _ 83 percent of the
population _ speak French, ``linguistic security'' remains a major
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Schoolchildren learn that when British soldiers conquered Quebec
in 1759, Dutch was the second language of New York, German was the
second language of Pennsylvania, and 60,000 defeated Quebecers
spoke French. Today, while the lost European languages of colonial
America are historical footnotes, Quebecers grow up vowing to
resist ``la Louisianisation'' _ a code word for the assimilation of
Louisiana's French-speaking Cajuns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Language is at the root of Quebec nationalism,'' Lysiane
Gagnon, a La Presse columnist, wrote recently.
</P>
<P>
   For the last quarter-century, an elaborate legal code has made
Quebec a vast language laboratory experiment to shore up French,
similar to the way that Gaelic has been revived in Ireland and
modern Hebrew strengthened in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Waiters and shop clerks in this tourist city must first greet
customers ``bonjour.'' On public signs, French words must be
``predominant,'' generally twice the size of those in any other
language. If a business wants to buy an advertisement in English
yellow pages, it must first buy one in French yellow pages. (French
advertisers are not obliged to buy English advertisements.)
</P>
<P>
   In public schools, English-speaking children are encouraged to
start learning French in kindergarten. But French-speaking children
are not allowed to start English classes until fourth grade. By
law, all children of immigrants must be schooled in French. A
recent poll conducted for The Gazette, the English daily newspaper
here, found that 71.4 percent of French-speaking respondents
complained that their children were not learning enough English.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tongue troopers target city,'' a recent headline in The
Chronicle, an English-language weekly, warned over an article
describing how Pointe Claire, an English suburb of Montreal, had
been ordered to change its street signs. To obey French grammar,
the word ``Avenue'' was to precede names, not to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Many English-speaking Quebecers see such measures as unfair and
authoritarian. In the last 25 years, about 250,000 English-speaking
Quebecers have left the province. Feeling besieged, leaders of the
remaining English-speaking residents resort to such measures as
counting library books that Montreal is buying this year. While
about 17 percent of Montreal's households are English-speaking,
only 6.7 percent of the 120,000 books expected to be purchased this
year are in English, said William Johnson, president of Alliance
Quebec, the largest English-language lobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is simply mythology to say that French is threatened in
Quebec,'' said Johnson, who often speaks French at home.
``Requiring this kneeling down of all languages before French is
sheer linguistic imperialism.''
</P>
<P>
   But many French-speaking Quebecers see such measures as
essential.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without French signs, the message to visitors and immigrants
is very ambivalent,'' said Robin Philpot, spokesman for the Societe
St.-Jean-Baptiste, a leading nationalist group here. ``The gains in
Montreal are fragile. You could easily have immigrants _ and French
kids _ saying, hey, the future is English.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Demanding French toys, Nathalie Petrowski, mother of an
8-year-old boy, wrote despairingly: ``My torment started with
Nintendo control panels in Japanese and English. The torture
continued with Pokemon cards.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Quebec's weight in Canada's population has slipped from
one- third at the time of confederation, in 1867, to one-quarter
today. Despite official measures to strengthen French here, the
proportion of French-speakers in Quebec's population is expected to
erode slightly over the next quarter-century, to 81 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With Quebec's birthrate one of North America's lowest,
provincial leaders are pushing to expand the number of
French-speaking immigrants by almost 50 percent over the next three
years, to 17,000. Although only 40 percent of immigrants here adopt
or maintain French as their home language, officials say that is an
increase over the 25 percent level of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``If French Quebec `loses' the immigrants, people will no longer
be speaking French in Quebec in two generations,'' wrote Gagnon,
the columnist.
</P>
<P>
   Among the nearly 1 million French-speaking Canadians outside of
Quebec, the conversion rate to English is about 30 percent for each
generation, estimated Beaudoin, Quebec's language minister.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This winter, many Quebecers were outraged when Ontario's
premier, Mike Harris, refused to make Ottawa a bilingual city under
a consolidation plan that is to take effect next January.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Jean Chretien, a Quebecer, thundered in
Parliament that it is ``very important that the national capital be
bilingual.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Facal, Quebec's minister for intergovernmental affairs,
said, ``It is another illustration that, living in French, outside
of Quebec in Canada, is a daily, uphill struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   But behind closed doors the linguistic mathematics were not lost
on Facal and other separatists. If they were to demand that greater
Ottawa, with a French-speaking population of 15 percent, be
bilingual, who is to say that Montreal, with an English-speaking
population of 17 percent, should not be bilingual, too?
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Quebec's separatist-controlled provincial
legislature sidestepped a call for bilingualism and instead passed
a resolution that merely urged Ottawa to provide services in French
to its estimated 110,000 French-speaking residents.

   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ Israeli jets attacked targets in Lebanon for
the second day in a row Tuesday, giving what Arabic-language
newspapers here described as a military riposte to the 22-nation
Arab League for its weekend meeting in Beirut and its harsh
denunciation of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese guerrillas of Hezbollah, the Party of God,
responded with rocket and artillery attacks against Israeli
military positions in the border area.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli air raids have generally been held back since a bombing
on Feb. 8 destroyed three electricity generators. That assault
stirred widespread anger in the Arab world and prompted the Arab
League to switch its previously scheduled foreign ministers'
meeting to Beirut from Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the Hezbollah appeared to have scaled back attacks on
Israeli military posts in southern Lebanon that had killed seven
Israeli soldiers over 18 days.
</P>
<P>
   But that restraint appears to have been thrown to the wind.
</P>
<P>
   No fresh casualties among Israel's 1,500-member occupation force
were reported. But Lebanese military statements said that a
Lebanese soldier and a civilian were killed by artillery on Monday
and that others were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanese military officials reported more than 20 Israeli
bombing raids in the 24 hours from Monday morning to Tuesday and
dozens of artillery barrages, by far the heaviest onslaught since
the power plants were bombed.
</P>
<P>
   The targets included suspected Hezbollah bases close to the
nine-mile zone occupied by Israel in southern Lebanon; bases of
another Islamic radical group, Amal; and, in one artillery attack
that was apparently the work of a Christian-led Lebanese militia
group allied to the Israeli forces, a Lebanese army checkpoint near
southern Tyre.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most significant Israeli strikes _ and certainly the
ones that carried the clearest political message _ were attacks
Monday on two armed Palestinian camps close to the border between
Lebanon and Syria, 40 miles east of Beirut. The camps, near Yanta
and Koussaya, each less than 2 miles from the border, are
controlled by hard-line Palestinian groups that have rejected
Yasser Arafat's peace negotiations with Israel, the Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command and Fatah-Uprising,
another radical splinter group.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanese military officials said the attacks on the camps were
Israel's first since 1986. They appeared to have been Israel's
answer to a warning from the Arab League over the weekend. The
League condemned Israeli ``aggression'' against Lebanon and said
that armed Palestinians based in Lebanon could resume attacks on
Israel after Israel's planned withdrawal from southern Lebanon this
year, unless Israel agreed to accompany the pullout with
negotiations for repatriating the huge Palestinian refugee
population in camps in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has always refused to countenance the return of the
Palestinians, most of whom are from families that became refugees
in the 1948 war that led to the founding of Israel. Israel has
instead demanded that Lebanon give the Palestinians permanent
residence and civic rights, like permission to work freely.
</P>
<P>
   In a communique on Saturday, the Arab League, at the behest of
Lebanon, said the 360,000 Palestinians that Lebanon says live in
the camps would be a ``time-bomb'' threatening Israel unless their
plight was resolved as part of a security deal covering the
pullout, which is scheduled to be carried out by early July.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli ministers mocked the demand, describing it as surreal
and worse. Former Prime Minister Shimon Peres suggested that it was
the first time in history that a nation had been threatened by an
occupied country for announcing that it was withdrawing its troops.
In the Israeli view, Lebanon and Syria, the two Arab nations
bordering Israel that have not signed peace agreements with the
government in Jerusalem, are trying to use the pullout announcement
to extract concessions on other long-running issues that need to be
addressed separately.
</P>
<P>
   Syria, which exercises de facto control in Lebanon through its
own military force of 35,000 troops, has in recent weeks appeared
to have been encouraging increased guerrilla pressures on the
Israeli troops in Lebanon as a means of pushing Israel toward
concessions for the Golan Heights, the Syrian territory that Israel
seized in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
</P>
<P>
   Syria's demand for an unconditional return of the heights led to
the collapse of peace talks between the two countries in January.
</P>
<P>
   By attacking two Palestinian camps close to the Syrian border,
Israel appeared to have been sending a pointed message to Syria.
Although reporters were denied access to the two camps after the
bombings, there were signs that both suffered serious damage and,
possibly, casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Several Beirut newspapers reported seeing the smoldering ruins
of a jeep, an artillery piece and what appeared to be an arms depot
at the Popular Front base at Yanta, as well as what appeared to be
bloodstains on the ground at the entrance to the base.
</P>
<P>
   A commander at the base, using the nom de guerre of Abu Kifah,
acknowledged the accuracy of the strike. ``They scored direct
hits,'' he said.

TROPICANA FIELD TO GET NEW PLAYING SURFACE

<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ The Tampa Bay Devil Rays are installing a
$1 million artificial playing surface at Tropicana Field that looks
and plays more like natural grass than the current AstroTurf
surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would defy anyone to say it's not grass,'' Vince Naimoli,
owner of the Devil Rays, said.
</P>
<P>
   A product of FieldTurf, the surface will be the only one of its
kind in the major leagues. It is the same surface used at the
University of Nebraska's football stadium. Naimoli said the surface
will be in place at the indoor stadium for Tampa Bay's home opener
on April 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get it as close to an outdoor stadium as we can and
this accomplishes that,'' Naimoli said.
</P>
<P>
   The new surface should make a dramatic difference for players.
Several Devil Rays have taken ground balls on the turf and said it
is not as fast or as bouncy as the old one. The shortstop Kevin
Stocker said it is ``100 times'' better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did about every test we could and it passed with flying
colors,'' the Tampa Bay Manager Larry Rothschild said.
</P>
<P>
   The AstroTurf surface, used for the last two years, gave
Tropicana Field one of the hardest and fastest surfaces in
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The all-dirt basepaths will remain. Stocker said there will
still be some tricky hops with balls bouncing from turf to dirt.
However, the new surface will be much softer and should lessen the
stress on players' knees. Fly balls hit into the outfield should no
longer jump over a player's head.
</P>
<P>
   Naimoli said the life expectancy of the new infield surface is
eight to 10 years. The outfield is expected to last up to 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The new surface is made from a synthetic blend of fibers that
are crafted into a pattern similar to natural grass. It is put down
over a base of sand and rubber recycled from old tires and shoes.

 &HT;    Incanta strikes high-speed deal
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Incanta Inc. this week announced a pact with San
Francisco-based Northpoint Communications Group, aimed at
delivering music and video services over high-speed lines.
</P>
<P>
   Incanta, a 6-month-old, Atlanta-based start-up, will provide
technology to Northpoint that will be used over networks using
digital subscriber lines _ DSL _ in 33 markets. The companies
released no financial details, other than to say that the agreement
calls for them to share revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Incanta, an ambitious, 30-employee company founded by former
executives of Nortel Networks, aims to provide the technology
behind the delivery of top-quality music and video to users of
high-speed Internet services. However, Incanta will likely not be a
household name to most users, since the company will sell its
systems to Internet service providers that will, in turn, use them
to deliver services to subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Trial versions of Incanta's music player have been in use for
about five months. Prestige Cable TV Inc. has been conducting a
similar trial with some of its customers in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to release similar technologies for use with
video later this year. Incanta says the software, which users will
download from their ISP, will permit those users to receive
personalized programming, including sportscasts that include only
highlights and stories the user requests.
</P>
<P>
   Incanta's technology is designed for use on high-speed lines
like cable modems or DSL, service known as broadband for its
ability to handle the great quantities of data needed for video and
digital audio.
</P>
<P>
   Incanta cites studies by International Data Group showing the
market for broadband growing 80 percent a year through 2003.
</P>
<P>
   IDC predicts that one-third of all households will have
broadband links to the Net by that year. IDC also believes that
entertainment will likely account for the lion's share of broadband
use.
</P>
<P>
   Cyber Dialogue, another research firm, says 61.5 million people
use the Internet, and that 70 percent of them search for
entertainment-related content. Cyber Dialogue concludes that
entertainment has evolved into the ``unifying force of modern
commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   Creaxion, an Atlanta-based marketing company, said it has been
hired by Incanta to handle the launch of the company's music
service. Creaxion plans ads in print and online starting March
19th. The ad campaign is planned for Atlanta, Austin, San Antonio
and San Diego.

available in a new edition, with a foreword by the journalist and
social historian David Halberstam, published late last year by
Fotofolio. And Owens, today better known as an authority on brewing
beer, is suddenly in vogue again, showing in major galleries from

BINGE-DRINKING CONTINUES APACE ON CAMPUSES, SURVEY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN HSU  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   College students are still drinking to get drunk. Despite
efforts to curb drinking on campus, the percentage of students
indulging in alcohol binges has stayed roughly the same through the
1990s, and the percentage of frequent bingers has increased,
researchers said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the percentage of teetotalers also increased somewhat,
according to the survey released Tuesday by the Harvard School of
Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   Those who do binge the most tend to be white, live in a
fraternity or sorority, and have a history of drinking in high
school, according to the study led by Henry Wechsler, a social
psychologist who followed up is 1993 and 1997 drinking studies.
</P>
<P>
   Boston-area colleges and universities increased attention and
efforts to curb college campus drinking after well-publicized
incidents such as the death of MIT freshman Scott Krueger in 1997.
Last November, an MIT fraternity was disbanded after six Wellesley
College freshman were served alcohol at the fraternity. Last week
the Licensing Board for the City of Boston unanimously voted to
suspend the rock club Paradise's license for six months for
violations, including serving alcohol to minors.
</P>
<P>
   But Wechsler said efforts decrease college drinking haven't
worked yet. ``It may be too early. I may be expecting too much,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, Wechsler defined a binge drinker as a man who
drank at least five drinks in a row, or a woman who drank four, at
least once in the two weeks before the survey. A frequent binge
drinker had binged three or more times in the two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 study found the population of binge drinkers had stayed
the same since 1997, at 44 percent, and frequent binge drinkers
rose last year to 22.7 percent of the student population, up from
19.8 percent in 1993 and 20.9 percent in 1997. Among fraternity or
sorority houses, Wechsler's study found that 78.9 percent of
students living in fraternity or sorority housing were binge
drinkers.
</P>
<P>
   More than 14,000 college students at 119 four-year colleges
nationwide filled out the surveys that were mailed to them by
Wechsler and his colleagues. The project was sponsored by the
Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the survey has a margin of error
was plus or minus 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``To make the situation harder for college administrators, most
of these students do not feel they have a problem, and the large
majority consider themselves moderate drinkers,'' said Wechsler.
But he pointed out that the majority of college students are not
binge drinkers and one-third are living in alcohol-free residence
halls.
</P>
<P>
   But others have questioned if Wechsler's definition, which does
not take into account body weight or time, has perpetrated a notion
that college students are drinking more than they really are.
</P>
<P>
   William DeJong, director of the Higher Education Center for
Alcohol and Other Drug Prevention, said clinicians define
binge-drinking to be an ``out-of-control'' drinking habit, and said
that students could reasonably consumer five drinks over a night
with food and not be drunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students have hooted at the notion that five drinks is
considered a binge,'' DeJong said.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Phalen, program director for alcohol and other drug
education at Northeastern University, one of the universities in
Wechsler's study, said that one of the newest ways to targeting
students is social marketing, and telling students about the huge
gap in perception and reality of college drinking. Phalen said that
although alcohol is the number one problem on college campuses, the
notion that everybody is drinking heavily feeds into the
misconception.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normal use on (the Northeastern) campus is moderation or
non-use,'' said Phalen. In a 1998 survey, Phalen said that 72
percent of Northeastern students drank five or less drinks on an
average week, and 25 percent didn't drink.
</P>
<P>
   Although colleges are talking about incorporating more alcohol
education, MIT junior Todd Esguerra said that students won't
listen. ``When you are told not to drink, that makes you want to do
it more,'' said Esguerra.
</P>
<P>
   But the percentage of students who don't drink at all has been
rising steadily, from 15.4 percent in 1993 to 18.9 percent in 1997
and finally, 19.2 percent in 1999, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   Ed McGlothin, a junior at Florida State University and describes
himself as an occasional drinker, said that after pledging into a
fraternity during his freshman year, he became disgusted with
taking care of other students who became sick from drinking.
Students like McGlothin are working with school administrators
brainstorm ideas to curb college drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Campbell, spokesman for MIT, said that two years ago, the
budget for student events was tripled to $300,000 a year to plan
more alcohol-free events.
</P>
<P>
   While the study found students who take part in ``industrial
strength alcohol consumption'' have increased risks of missing
class, getting in trouble, damaging property or getting hurt, it
also found that such drinkers have ``secondhand effects'' on their
peers.
</P>
<P>
   Students at high-binge campuses were twice as likely to report
being assaulted, awakened, or kept from studying by drinking
students than were nonbinge drinkers at campuses where it was less
common.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Wiegert, a University of Nebraska-Lincoln senior and Beta
Theta Pi fraternity member who used to drink more than 10 drinks a
night, said he quit drinking excessively when he realized he often
said stupid things while drunk and once broke a table.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a cost-benefit analysis for me,'' the economics major
said. ``I have yet to come up with one benefit to high-risk
drinking.''

 &HT;    ITC DeltaCom in pact with IBM to give customers Net support
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ITC DeltaCom has announced a deal in which the company
can use IBM to provide customers with Internet support, including
the capability of sending certified mail via the Net.
</P>
<P>
   The service continues efforts by West Point-based ITC DeltaCom
to shift toward sectors that are among the hottest in
telecommunications, the demand for data and Internet services. ITC
DeltaCom has a network that includes 8,250 miles of fiber-optic
lines, but the pact announced this week is more about service that
will be provided through e-DeltaCom, the new company created
recently by ITC DeltaCom to focus on the data and Internet
business.
</P>
<P>
   ITC DeltaCom expects to invest about $250 million during the
next 36 months to develop the e-DeltaCom subsidiary, said Andrew M.
Walker, chief executive officer of ITC DeltaCom.
</P>
<P>
   Combining with IBM enhances e-DeltaCom's offering to customers,
Walker said. ``This relationship fulfills a marketplace demand by
bringing together the two companies' networking and technology
expertise to create a one-stop shop for integrated, hosted
e-business solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   The new ITC DeltaCom subsidiary will be based in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The company also is planning to open data centers elsewhere in
Georgia, as well as in Florida and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ITC DeltaCom also announced that Morgan Stanley Senior Funding,
Banc of America Securities and Goldman Sachs Credit Partners will
underwrite a $160 million senior secured credit facility.
</P>
<P>
   The company will use the money to fund e-DeltaCom, as well as
other needs in the company, Walker said.

`TOURNAMENT OF SHADOWS': IMPERIALISM AT ANY COST IN THE MONGOL LAND
MASS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.) (Michael
Rosenthal is the author of ``The Character Factory: Baden-Powell's
Boy Scouts and the Imperatives of Empire.'') (DW) 
 By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1904, the British geographer Halford J. Mackinder delivered
an influential lecture proclaiming the geopolitical importance of
what he identified as the ``heart-land of Euro- Asia.'' Pointing
ominously toward the Russians, he suggested that mastery of this
land mass could produce another vast Mongol empire capable of world
domination.
</P>
<P>
   But even without his official warning, the British had been
maneuvering for almost a century to prevent Russian control of
Central Asia. ``Tournament of Shadows,'' a Russian count, K.V.
Nesselrode, called the struggle. For the British, it was the Great
Game.
</P>
<P>
   It is a tribute to Rudyard Kipling's artistry that the Great
Game became forever etched in the Western imagination through his
1901 novel, ``Kim,'' depicting the successful efforts of his young
orphan hero, Kimball O'Hara, to resist Russian incursions in India.
If Kipling popularized the term, however, he didn't invent it.
Credit for that goes to Arthur Conolly, a young British officer
devoted to the game (``a great game, a noble game,'' he wrote to a
friend) and one of its grisliest losers.
</P>
<P>
   Committed to the sacred calling of frustrating Russian
ambitions, Conolly managed to insist in 1842 that he be allowed to
try to persuade the unpleasant Emir of Bukhara to support British
interests and in the process release a fellow officer whom he had
imprisoned. For his efforts Conolly was subjected for many months
to the Emir's infamous bug pit, after which his public beheading
probably came as a relief.
</P>
<P>
   An illuminating and engaging history of the Game, ``Tournament
of Shadows'' is interested primarily in the players _ the spies,
explorers, soldiers, cartographers, mystics, biologists and museum
collectors, among others _ who risked and not infrequently lost
their lives while participating in it.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing upon an immense range of secondary sources as well as
original archival research, the authors, Karl E. Meyer and Shareen
Blair Brysac, scour the mountains and deserts of Central Asia
pursuing the exploits of the intrepid, possessed and often
pathological men immersed in the dreams of empire and adventure.
</P>
<P>
   The specimens of behavior that Meyer, a former editorial writer
for The New York Times, and Brysac, his wife and a producer of
television documentaries, bring back from their travels are as
exotic as any of the rare flora their subjects discovered in the
hills. We meet the ruthless Nikolai Mikhailovich Przhevalsky,
considered Russia's greatest explorer, who loathed the Asian people
whose land he traversed in four expeditions. An implacable big-game
hunter who mourned the death of his dogs, an army officer who
disliked the army, he was celebrated by Chekhov, used as a model
for a character by Nabokov in ``The Gift,'' and even reputed to be
Stalin's biological father. His last book suggested exterminating
all Mongolians and Tibetans and replacing them with Cossacks.
</P>
<P>
   We follow Col. Francis Younghusband's manipulations of the
British government until, for no particularly compelling reason, he
is finally given permission in 1904 to invade the legendary
``forbidden'' Tibetan city of Lhasa. To support a force of 2,000
fighting men he assembled some 7,000 mules, 5,200 bullocks, 1,500
Tibetan yaks and 2,900 Nepalese yaks, along with 10,000 porters.
His own personal effects, packed in 29 containers, included 67
shirts, 19 coats (including a full-dress coat, a morning coat, an
Assam silk coat, two jaeger coats, a Chesterfield coat, a poshteen
long coat and a Chinese fur coat), as well as at least five hats.
Younghusband was clearly a man who liked to be prepared, as the
slaughter of some 800 Tibetans at the cost of 14 British wounded in
two preliminary skirmishes indicated.
</P>
<P>
   Focusing primarily (and appropriately) on the classic Great Game
confrontation of Russian and British, ``Tournament of Shadows''
also attends to American dabblings in the region. We are introduced
to Januarius MacGahan, whose reporting of Turkish massacres of
Bulgarians led to the Russo-Turkish War, and to William Rockhill,
translator of Tibetan texts, friend of Theodore Roosevelt and the
first American to advise the Dalai Lama. Rockhill's 10-month,
8,000-mile journey through Tibet in 1891 came to an end when he ran
out of food and had to subsist on tea for a number of days.
</P>
<P>
   We meet Roosevelt's two sons, Kermit and Theodore, and their
friend Suydam Cutting, who collected birds and animals from their
Tibetan expeditions for American museums. Agreeing to help market
Tibetan wool in the United States, Cutting received three pairs of
Lhasa apsos from the grateful Dalai Lama, and promptly returned to
this country to become the dogs' first breeder.
</P>
<P>
   Most enigmatic of all, we encounter the Russian mystic and
artist Nicholas Roerich, whose friendship with the American
Secretary of Agriculture (and future presidential candidate) Henry
Wallace led him on an expedition to Central Asia in 1933 in search
of drought-resistant grass to replant the disastrous American Dust
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   With all the scheming and the spying, the interfering and the
blundering (my favorite anecdote concerns a British agent who so
confused the Bolshevik secret police in Turkestan that they
recruited him to hunt for himself), were there any unequivocal
benefits that emerged from the Great Game?
</P>
<P>
   For Meyer and Brysac, the answer is simple: knowledge. However
nefarious or self-serving their motives, the men who endured severe
hardships crisscrossing unknown terrain generated precious
information about Central Asia's physical and cultural geography.
They measured the heights of mountain passes, determined the
sources of rivers, produced detailed maps and took valuable
photographs. Whatever else they achieved, it is their letters,
diaries, charts and sketches that constitute, as the authors nicely
put it, ``the authentic jewels in the imperial crown.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the geopolitical advantages sought by the two main
competitors, the results are less auspicious. Nothing could save
Tibet from being swallowed by China. The irony is not lost upon
Meyer and Brysac that when the ultimate British nightmare came to
pass and the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, its major
consequence was to speed up the dissolution of the Soviet empire. A
Great Game to be sure, but in retrospect perhaps not the sort that
could ever be won. &QL;

FIDELITY, OTHERS, STRUGGLE TO HANDLE THE BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Hell hath no fury like an anxious investor who can't
make a trade.
</P>
<P>
   A wave of anger is sweeping the nation's growing ranks of online
brokerage customers as Fidelity Investments and other major brokers
are facing such high volumes of online trading and phone calls that
they can barely keep up.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity spokesman Jim Griffin said that, on average, the Boston
investment giant's customers are making 170,000 trades a day this
month, up from 94,000 per day a year ago. The company has seen its
25 heaviest trading days ever since Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We obviously are aware of the volume increases, and we are
trying to do the best that we can to service the customer,''
Griffin said. The company is calling on its ``corporate reserve''
staff to pitch in handling customer calls. It's also plans to add
several hundred people to its 3,200 phone staff over the next few
months.
</P>
<P>
   That won't be soon enough to satisfy Alan Cohen. The investor
said he's yanking his six-figure account out of Fidelity after
waiting on hold for more than 20 minutes recently for a service
representative. His complaints fell on deaf ears, he said, and even
his urgent request to shift some money to a separate account took
two business days, instead of one, as Fidelity had promised him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's dangerous,'' Cohen said. ``What was supposed to get
done, didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen is hardly alone in his ire. Do-it-yourself investors are
trading and checking accounts online and via automated phone
services as never before. The discount brokerage business has
quadrupled since 1995, to $1.4 trillion. More than half of that is
now invested online, according to Cerulli Associates Inc., a Boston
research firm. By 2004, Cerulli estimates, those assets will hit $3
trillion, with 85 percent of trades handled online.
</P>
<P>
   With that kind of growth, it's no surprise that, when Web sites
falter, and when the stock market is particularly volatile,
discount brokers' phone lines clog fast.
</P>
<P>
   John Payne, a Cerulli consultant, said, ``All the online brokers
are struggling to keep pace with the demand, and their service
groups are falling behind.''
</P>
<P>
   DLJ Direct has had trouble with its Web site for two days. A
message posted there Monday directed online investors to call a rep
to make their trades. Charles Schwab &AMP; Co., the king of online
brokerage, concedes it's having major service trouble lately too.
</P>
<P>
   Said a senior spokesman at Schwab, ``During periods of extreme
market volatility, our customers have been forced to wait much
longer periods of time than we would like.'' He added, ``It's
frustrating to our clients and it's frustrating to us as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwab logged 3.5 million customer phone calls in February,
compared to 2.5 million a year earlier. The company is hiring 300
new service representatives a month this year to add to its 7,000
base.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity attributes its jump in calls to the many recent days of
100- to 200-point dips and hops of the Nasdaq and the Dow. Tax
season always brings more customer demand for personal help,
Griffin said. And hot stock offerings and the bull market in
technology stocks have piqued investor interest across the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Fidelity's experience when Palm Inc., the maker of
trendy handheld computers, went public early this month. Fidelity
got about 2,000 calls around 10 p.m. _ a normally quiet time _ from
customers who wanted to know what the IPO price was and to submit
buy orders.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the challenge discount brokers face in this steamy
market. ``Customer service is being redefined in the Internet
age,'' Cerulli's Payne observed. ``They expect the same level of
service they would get from a full-service broker.''

BEHIND THE SCENES AT `TOY STORY ON ICE'
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Whether it really is flying or ``just falling with style,'' Buzz
Lightyear will be airborne along with cowboy Woody and the rest of
the gang in ``Disney Presents Toy Story on Ice,'' opening tonight
at the Great Western Forum.
</P>
<P>
   The production, which debuted in 1996, is making the rounds
again to capitalize on the popularity of ``Toy Story 2'' in
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Feld, a contemporary P.T. Barnum-style show promoter,
charged skate choreographers Robin Cousins and Cindy Stuart and his
Florida-based production design team with capturing the look and
personality of the inhabitants of Andy's room, who spring to life
as soon as their owner steps out the door. From both points of view
_ choreography and design _ it was not all fun and games.
</P>
<P>
   For Matt and Mark Freddes, twin brothers who transform sketches
into actual props and costumes at Hagenbeck-Wallace in Sarasota,
Fla., the task was to emulate the sleek, colorful, plastic
playthings in the computer-animated film.
</P>
<P>
   For Stuart and 1980 Olympic gold medalist Cousins, the aim was
to take full advantage of the skaters' talents while they're
wearing layers of bulky vinyl-coated foam.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Freddes said once a script is developed, the show's
creators _ including the director; musical director; designers of
scenery, costumes and lighting; and the choreographers _ sit down
for what's known as a white-model meeting, with a 1-inch-scale
model of a typical ice rink, the set pieces, the large props and
all the costumed characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We start determining how the show is going to come together
and what changes should be made,'' Freddes said. ``You've got
designers fighting for a look and choreographers fighting for their
skaters in terms of the moves they want them to make and how hard
the costumes might be to work with.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the music is complete (and since ``Toy Story'' was not a
musical, entire production numbers had to be composed), Cousins and
Stuart plan the show, writing down each step and plotting the moves
of up to 32 characters on the ice at one time.
</P>
<P>
   ``These costumes proved to be a great challenge for the skaters
who skate in them,'' Stuart said. ``But they're remarkably
adaptable. We have two extraordinarily strong skaters in these
roles (Eddie Gornick as Woody and Alexander Klimkin as Buzz).
</P>
<P>
   ``When they first put them on, they're like, `No way,' Stuart
said, ``but little by little we would add pieces of costume so they
would adjust, and then we would add another.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like two steps forward, one step back until they got
completely adjusted to the extra weight and bulk.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuart said Klimkin even learned to make Buzz's jetpack an
asset.
</P>
<P>
   ``The backpack, which weighs 15 pounds, can actually work for
the skater in terms of the centrifugal force it creates when the
skater is rotating,'' she said. ``The more weight that's pulling
out when you're spinning, you pull against it with more strength
and it just increases the speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has watched the Winter Olympics or championships
knows that even the best skaters in the world fall sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart said the skaters playing Mr. Potato Head and those
roly-poly green aliens have their work cut out for them when they
have to get up, but it can be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only characters that literally cannot get up are the
trolls, and they're very cute when they fall over,'' Stuart said.
``Then Rocky Gibralter, who is the strong man, will go and pick
them up.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt Freddes estimated the production budget at $10 million, but
with an international tour that can run six or seven years, there
is ample time to recoup that investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to spend more money than we have to, but the
bottom line is we want to do the biggest and the best thing, and to
top ourselves,'' Freddes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Kenneth Feld) is adamant that you don't go to a show to see
the same things twice. You go to see the best you can see, and we
try to achieve that.'' &QL;

A PERFECT DAY FOR THE SOX _ 6 TIMES OVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ When Toronto's Chris Woodward hit a shot to
left with one out in the ninth inning Tuesday _ a shot that seemed
ready, willing, and able to clear the left field fence _ Red Sox
pitcher Rod Beck wasn't worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd been watching batting practice,'' said the reliever, ``and
I said, `This ball's not going out today.' That wind was gusting
all day and balls were crushed in batting practice and they weren't
going out. I said, `If the ball's in the air, it's not going out.'
''
</P>
<P>
   On a warm and still July afternoon in Fenway Park, Woodward's
drive might have struck the Citgo sign in Kenmore Square. But
Tuesday? Beck merely shrugged as he watched the flight of the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, back in the Red Sox clubhouse, some nine or 10 of the
players were screaming at the television, Jose Offerman the
loudest. Offerman was there with Nomar Garciaparra and a handful of
other starters whose spring training day was done early.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Woodward hit the ball to the fence, Offerman helped keep
it in the park by screaming at the TV,'' said Red Sox pitcher Dan
Smith. ``Offerman's taking credit for it.''
</P>
<P>
   For saving ``it.''
</P>
<P>
   A perfect game for the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, it means something,'' said Smith, one of the perfect
pitchers in the Red Sox' 5-0 win. ``Has this ever happened? Six
guys pitching? Who knows? It might never happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooperstown has yet to call, but six Red Sox pitchers
accomplished a feat that _ spring training or no spring training _
is still remarkable. Twenty-seven Blue Jays went up to the plate _
to face Pedro Martinez at the start and Beck at the end _ and 27
Blue Jays were retired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew what was going on,'' said Red Sox manager Jimy
Williams. ``You see three eggs on the wall, you're hoping to see
nine before it.'' True enough, the three goose eggs for hits, runs,
and errors were on the scoreboard, but so were the nine goose eggs
for innings played.
</P>
<P>
   No longtime Red Sox watcher could remember the team ever
throwing a no-hitter in spring training, let alone a perfect game.
Nor could veteran baseball watchers recall a spring training
perfect game by any team. The Elias Sports Bureau said it does not
keep track of spring training statistics, although the last
no-hitter in spring training came four years ago when the Angels
beat San Francisco, 15-0.
</P>
<P>
   The last Red Sox perfect game was that famous (or infamous)
perfect game with an asterisk, back on June 23, 1917, when Babe
Ruth started for Boston and walked the first batter. Ruth
complained about the call on ball four, was tossed out of the game
by the umpires, and Ernie Shore came on to retire the next 27
Washington Senators he faced. Shore was credited with a perfect
game.
</P>
<P>
   The only other Red Sox perfect game came on May 5, 1904, when Cy
Young himself mowed down all 27 Philadelphia A's.
</P>
<P>
   Spring training or no, perfect games by the Red Sox are as rare
as . . . well, World Series wins by the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pitched a perfect game! I pitched a perfect game!,''
Martinez screamed in mock excitement after Beck retired the 27th
Blue Jay, Alberto Castillo, on a strikeout. Perhaps most remarkable
of all, it was only then that Beck learned what he and the other
five Red Sox pitchers had accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't find out about it until I turned around to shake the
guys' hands and I looked up and I saw it on the board,'' said Beck.
``I saw, `perfect game,' and I said, `Hey, pretty cool.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Beck had seen the first six innings ``and I knew we had a
no-hitter but then I had to go and stretch, and you can't see
what's going on from where I was. They're moving players in and
out, they're changing pitchers, you can't see from our bullpen, so
it's a hard thing to keep track of. So I didn't know about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when he took the mound in the ninth?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' said Beck, ``and I'm kind of embarrassed about that, to
tell you the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Four times Martinez went to 3-and-2 counts in his three innings
and each time retired the batter. Fernando De La Cruz, who pitched
the fourth and fifth innings, said he knew about the perfect game
``and it feels good to pitch in one. It feels very good.''
</P>
<P>
   But Smith, Rheal Cormier, Rich Garces, and Beck, all of whom
pitched one inning each, said they did not know of the perfect game
when they took the mound. And each said maybe it's better that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just went out there to get my 1-2-3 outs,'' said Garces. ``I
was here in the clubhouse before I pitched and I went out there not
realizing what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as soon as I get to the weight room, it was like all the
guys were saying, mostly Nomar, `Hey, man, we've got a perfect game
going.' And they say, `You pitched a perfect game.' And I say,
`OK.' Hopefully now, it happens in the real season.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith was with the Expos last July when the Yankees' David Cone
pitched a perfect game against Montreal ``and it's two in two years
for me now,'' said the righty, who pitched the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a streak going now, but one of these years, I'd like
to do it myself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went running after my inning, and then I worked out and then
I got here in the clubhouse in the ninth and I heard on TV it was a
perfect game. I had no clue.''
</P>
<P>
   Better that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw a 3-and-2 slider to get the last guy out I faced
(Castillo in the sixth),'' said Smith of the pitch that caught the
Toronto catcher looking at strike three. ``I thought it was over
the plate but I don't think he did. And then Beck says to me after
the game, `A 3-and-2 slider, huh?' and I say, `I didn't know . . .
perfect game . . . I didn't know.' I don't know if I'd throw a
3-and-2 slider in a perfect game.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston reserve Joe Siddall, who caught the final three innings,
said, ``It's a great achievement, even if it's a spring training
game. This is a great feat, no matter what. Everybody strives for
perfection, and to achieve it in this game is pretty amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the pitchers Siddall caught was Cormier, who said he was
clueless as well. After he pitched the seventh, Cormier ran, ``and
then I went out to see my wife in the parking lot. I didn't know
anything about a perfect game. I had no clue. Somebody just told me
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Clueless or not, the six Red Sox pitchers who put ``three eggs
on the wall,'' as Williams called it, accomplished a feat. Even if
they don't get that call from Cooperstown.

MARKET PLACE: 19 ARE ACCUSED OF INSIDER TRADING DEALS OVER
INTERNET
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By CHRISTOPHER DREW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the first criminal case involving the swapping of
inside stock information over the Internet, the federal authorities
accused 19 people Tuesday of making $8.4 million on illegal tips
from a part-time graphics clerk on Wall Street who passed some of
the information on through private chat rooms and America Online's
instant messaging system.
</P>
<P>
   The clerk, John J. Freeman, who had temporary jobs at Goldman,
Sachs &AMP; Co. and Credit Suisse First Boston, pleaded guilty on
Tuesday in federal court in New York to sharing confidential
information on corporate mergers in exchange for $70,000 to
$110,000 in kickbacks from the trading profits.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman came up with the scheme in 1997 with two disgruntled
investors who frequented an Internet chat room involving stocks,
and the authorities say it expanded over nearly three years to
include illegal trading in four states by stockbrokers, insurance
salesmen, restaurant waiters, a dentist and a school teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney for the southern district of
New York, said the case was a good example of ``insider trading,
millennium style.'' She said it showed how the nature of insider
trading has changed as the public's captivation with the stock
markets, and the explosion of financial information on the
Internet, has led to a culture in which more people are searching
desperately for the latest edge or hot tips.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the era of insider trading involving top
securities executives that was popularized in the 1987 movie ``Wall
Street,'' White said, ``This is a case of Wall Street meeting Main
Street and coming back again _ over the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said the charges also marked the largest
criminal insider trading case ever in terms of the number of people
who made illegal trades and the number of business deals for which
inside information was stolen. They said Freeman rummaged through
garbage pails and the desks of other workers at Goldman, Sachs and
Credit Suisse First Boston to gather sensitive information about 23
mergers, acquisitions and buyouts, and then often did his own
research to decipher coded references meant to shield the
identities of the companies from workers at the investment houses.
</P>
<P>
   In prepared statements, both firms said that they were
cooperating fully with the authorities investigating the matter.
Goldman's statement said that ``the firm will do everything in its
power to ensure that anyone misappropriating confidential or
proprietary information will be caught and prosecuted.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeman and the 18 other defendants also face civil securities
fraud charges filed on Tuesday by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, which has stepped up enforcement of various types of
questionable stock activities on the Internet. It recently brought
a civil case accusing Yun Soo Oh Park, a stock picker known as
Tokyo Joe, of improperly touting stocks on the Internet to boost
his own trading profits, and earlier this month, Douglas Colt, a
former Georgetown University law student, settled similar charges
involving a Web site that he had set up to pass on hot tips about
penny stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But in some ways, Freeman's case is more reminiscent of the
frenetic kind of insider trading activity that took place around
IBM's acquisition of the Lotus Development Corp. in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, the SEC filed civil charges against 25 people with
insider trading after they reaped more than $1.3 million in illegal
profits based on confidential information that came from Lorraine
Cassano, a former secretary at IBM's office in Somers, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC said Cassano told her husband, who then told two friends
who agreed to buy stock for him. Those two friends told others and
soon the information had spread through a wide network of family
members, friends and stockbrokers, the SEC said. Many of them were
first-time or infrequent buyers of stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Among those charged in the case was a pizzeria owner, a bank
vice president, a private-school teacher, a grocery store owner, a
lawyer, the president of a direct-mail marketing company and
several stockbrokers.
</P>
<P>
   The Cassanos and at least two other defendants settled the SEC
charges against them.
</P>
<P>
   According to the federal charges filed yesterday, Freeman, 34,
first offered to supply inside information to James Cooper, a
Kentucky insurance agent, and Benton Erskine, the owner of a
computer supply store in West Virginia. The three men had been
commiserating in an Internet chat room over a stock in which they
had all lost money when Freeman suggested that he could give them
an inside edge on Wall Street deals, through Internet messages, if
they agreed to kick back 10 percent of the profits.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the documents said, Freeman began handing out the
tips even more indiscriminately. He gave them to neighbors in
Brooklyn; coworkers at his full-time job at the Philip Morris
Companies; and employees and customers at Les Halles restaurant in
New York, where he had another part-time job as a waiter.
</P>
<P>
   He often referred to the deals by code _ the largest ones were
called monsters _ and he took his kickbacks in cash, sometimes
slipped inside unsigned birthday cards. In one case, the documents
said, he was paid with cases of wine.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, who also pleaded guilty on Tuesday, and Erskine, who
could not be reached for comment, also passed Freeman's tips on to
chains of relatives and friends, including stockbrokers in
Tennessee and Kentucky who were charged with trading on the
information for themselves and their clients. Two businessmen even
called their trading account Blue Horseshoe Investments, a name
used as a code for insider trading by Gordon Gekko, the
swashbuckling character who articulated the Wall Street movie's
famed ethos that greed is good.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said they got onto the case through normal
exchange surveillance activities, and they arrested Freeman in
January. They said Freeman and Cooper had both cooperated with the
investigation. Nearly all of the other defendants were taken into
custody Tuesday and were being arraigned.

VOLVO'S PURCHASE OF RIVAL TRUCK MAKER BLOCKED BY EUROPEAN UNION
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Alcan Aluminium spelling is correct.) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ European antitrust regulators took some of their most
strenuous action against big corporate mergers on Tuesday, blocking
a planned $7 billion purchase by Volvo of the rival Swedish truck
maker Scania and forcing three large aluminum companies to withdraw
their proposed $17 billion combination.
</P>
<P>
   The moves by the European Union's competition commission are not
expected to slow the pace of global consolidation in the automotive
and aluminum industries. But they reflected the rigorous standards
set by Mario Monti, the chief European antitrust regulator, who in
his six months on the job has taken a far more aggressive position
than his predecessors in examining the impact of mergers on
competition.
</P>
<P>
   In rejecting a combination of Volvo and Scania, announced last
year, Monti said such a merger would dominate the Scandinavian
market and hold a virtual monopoly for heavy trucks in Sweden. Leif
Johansson, the Volvo chief executive, said the decision appeared to
``go against the basic concept of the common market.''
</P>
<P>
   Fears about opposition from Monti also led the aluminum
companies Alcan Aluminium of Canada and Pechiney of France to
withdraw a proposal for a three-way merger with Alusuisse Lonza
Group of Switzerland. The regulators said that they would accept a
combination of just Alcan and Alusuisse, but that a three-way deal
including Pechiney would have to be modified to satisfy their
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The three companies announced in August that they intended to
create the world's leading aluminum company, challenging the market
leader, Alcoa of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Johansson of Volvo said his company had no plans to sell the
Scania shares it now owns. Volvo holds 45.5 percent of Scania, and
the proposed merger would have created the world's second-largest
manufacturer of buses and trucks, after DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
   Investors bid up the shares of the losers in the regulatory
process, apparently in the expectation that either Volvo or
Pechiney, or both, could come into play as possible takeover
targets. Volvo stock rose 7 percent in Stockholm after the
announcement, to 236 kronor, or $27.13, and shares of Pechiney
gained 10 percent in Paris, closing at 57 euros, or $54.72.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Volvo sold its car-building division to Ford to
concentrate on heavy trucks, after rejecting a bid by Fiat to buy
the whole company. Recently, Volvo executives are said to have made
preliminary contacts with several other rivals, including Renault
of France, about a possible combination. Fiat, which on Monday
announced a wide reaching cooperation agreement with General Motors
in the car business, is known to be considering whether to make an
offer for Volvo.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, Volvo announced its intention to take full control
of Scania, forming a union of the world's No. 2 and No. 3 truck
makers. To overcome regulatory objections, Volvo agreed to open its
dealer network to the trucks of its competitors and to set a
ceiling on its market share in the Scandinavian countries. But
regulators said that even with such changes, the proposed
acquisition was unacceptable because it would ``significantly
change the market structure to the detriment of the customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office, Monti, an economics professor and former
dean of Bocconi University, the prestigious Italian business
school, has sought to shift the emphasis in European antitrust
policy from the fulfillment of legal requirements to an examination
of the consequences on commercial competition. The result has been
far tougher standards than were common in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Since the latest European antitrust regulations were enacted in
1990, only 11 proposed mergers have been blocked, while 11 others
were withdrawn in the face of probable refusal. But the proposed
mergers affected on Tuesday were the second and third Monti has
stopped since taking up his post in September.
</P>
<P>
   And the regulators are relying on support of their strict
interpretation by European courts. In 1996, the European Court of
Justice in Luxembourg upheld one of the first major efforts by
regulators to thwart a proposed merger on the basis of its
consequences for commercial markets, blocking a combination of two
big platinum-dealing companies, Lonrho of Britain and Gencor of
South Africa, declaring that the merged company would be able to
effectively dictate platinum prices in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Similar concerns seem to have motivated the regulators' hard
line on the proposed three-way aluminum deal. Monti appeared ready
to allow a merger of Alcan and Alusuisse after the companies agreed
to take steps to eliminate their dominant position in the market
for aluminum trihydrate, a substance used for fireproofing and film
manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   But he indicated that he would block a combination of Alcan and
Pechiney because of its potentially dominant position in the
European market for aluminum sheets used to make containers for
food, drinks and sprays.
</P>
<P>
   In similar statements, Alcan and Pechiney said Tuesday that they
would resubmit their proposal for a merger. The companies are under
particular pressure because of Alcoa's planned $6.3 billion
acquisition of Reynolds Metals, which is under investigation by
antitrust authorities both in Europe and the United States.

BOLLETTIERI POINTERS FOR FREE? AT LEAST FOR NOW  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW SAUER   
 Herald-Journal, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRADENTON, Fla. _ Nick Bollettieri, who has trained seven No. 1
tennis players, is the first big name at the Mysportsguru.com site,
which will link customers with ``gurus'' from their favorite
sports.
</P>
<P>
   The site, scheduled to debut in early April, will offer the
information for free for the time being. Consider that in the
context of Bollettieri's $1,500-per-hour fee for an hour of
one-on-one coaching or his $500-per-hour charge if you take the
step to enroll at his Bradenton-based tennis academy in Bradenton.
</P>
<P>
   The Fairfield, Conn.-based Internet company says it will display
Bollettieri's philosophy, animated demonstrations of his ideal
forehands, backhands, serves and other fundamentals and weekly tips
from the man who trained, among others, Andre Agassi, Boris Becker,
Jim Courier and Monica Seles.
</P>
<P>
   Bollettieri and International Management Group, a major sports
talent agency that owns the tennis academy, are partners in
Mysportsguru.com.
</P>
<P>
   Bollettieri estimated that he has spent between 2,000 and 3,000
hours working with the Internet company's managers developing his
portion of the site. He found the virtual coach idea intriguing.
``I'm going to be able to be the coach no matter where you are,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, right now, Bollettieri can't see how a student he has
coached via the Internet is doing. Eventually, though, personal
attention might come. Mysportsguru.com. is developing a one-on-one,
paid instructional format that would feature a live Bollettieri or
other coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might not get Nick every time, but you could get a
Bollettieri instructor,'' said John Ragland, the Web site's
36-year-old founder and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The site also seeks to personalize instruction based on
someone's experience.
</P>
<P>
   Mysportsguru.com is backed by venture capital from investors
with Ragland, who has launched other companies, leading the way.
Besides IMG, the site has enlisted the International Performance
Institute and the David Leadbetter Golf Academy, in addition to yet
undisclosed partners and gurus.
</P>
<P>
   The site has competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Brilliant Digital Entertainment, a Woodland Hills, Calif.
company, is designing animated sports tutorials using
``motion-capture'' technology similar to that of Mysportsguru.com.
</P>
<P>
   Bollettieri and fellow coach Greg Hill traveled to a studio in
Brooklyn, New York, last year for the site. Hill, wired with about
40 sensors, went through various tennis moves captured by the
sensors and on video to be converted into a digital format by
computers.
</P>
<P>
   While Hill will appear in various forms _ and for that matter,
genders _ on Mysportsguru.com, it remains his moves under the
animation, Ragland said.
</P>
<P>
   The animation is two-dimensional and fairly short. That allows
the images to be quickly downloaded on a modem. Speed was important
for a site trying to get as big a slice as possible of the 140
million people in the United States who play sports.
</P>
<P>
   So how will the site make money?
</P>
<P>
   One way is advertising content. Another is selling actual goods,
including Bollettieri's videos, books and other paraphernalia, but
also equipment and apparel tied to specific sports. That helps ease
the notion for Bollettieri of releasing, for free, some of the
techniques he has developed during the last 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long run they will develop dollars through
advertisement, sponsors and things like that, and hopefully we'll
go public or be bought out by a major company,'' Bollettieri said.
``I'm certainly not putting thousands and thousands of dollars into
something if I don't think it's going to be a success
business-wise.''

 &HT;    New supply line for hotels
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Triplicate? Forget it.
</P>
<P>
   A dot-com start-up is taking the paperwork out of procurement
for hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Hsupply.com, which was launched earlier this year, offers online
procurement services to the lodging industry, drastically
streamlining the often frustrating and time-consuming flow of
faxes, snail mail and phone calls between buyers and sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Procurement is ``very people and paper intensive,'' said Ravi
Kalakota, the company's 32-year-old founder and chief executive. He
said hotels spend about $16 billion annually on supplies and
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, as labor gets tighter and tighter, people look for
technology-based solutions.'' An expert in electronic commerce and
a former Eminent Scholar at Georgia State University, Kalakota
estimates that managers who do it the old way spend an average of
$100 in labor costs for a purchase order to work its way through
the process. The order takes about five sheets of paper _ each
going to a different person.
</P>
<P>
   Kalakota is betting an opportunity to streamline that process
will hook his company up with a hunger in many industries and will
tap into the lucrative and burgeoning business-to-business use of
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company is in the process of raising $20 million to
$30 million in additional capital.
</P>
<P>
   Once the system is perfected, Kalakota hopes to go after even
bigger clients and has his eye on companies such as behemoth Bass
Hotels &AMP; Resorts, which has headquarters for its Americas
operations in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a ways to go,'' he said. ``You have to think of
this as electricity. Initially, when electricity came out, people
were skeptical. The same thing is happening with respect to
(online) procurement. Procurement is the foundation on which
business is built. Without procurement there is no business.''
</P>
<P>
   And swift, inexpensive procurement may increase the
profitability of a company.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Brian Rafferty's experience blazing the paper trail of
procurement.
</P>
<P>
   Rafferty, former general manager of the Comfort Suites Duluth,
used to spend five to six hours a week ordering supplies and
processing invoices.
</P>
<P>
   There was soap, shampoo, linens and cleaning supplies that
needed to be ordered twice a week or monthly. And don't forget the
bagels, fruit and coffee for the continental breakfast. That had to
be done three to four times a week using several vendors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent a lot of time worrying whether the order was going to
come in right,'' said Rafferty, now an area manager for Noble
Investment Group, one of hsupply.com's early clients. Noble is
testing the service in five hotels. ``I was faxing back and forth
and playing phone tag with voice mail.''
</P>
<P>
   But now with just the click of a mouse, there's a ``tremendous
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafferty, who is Noble's liaison with hsupply.com, said many of
his headaches have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tracking is really the biggest plus,'' he said. ``You can see
past performance and ordering history and gauge what you need. And
I have a very high comfort level that when you place an order, it
will be on time and consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   The process has worked so well that Noble plans to roll it out
systemwide to its 25 hotels by midsummer.
</P>
<P>
   Hsupply.com is also offering the service to customers on the go.
</P>
<P>
   The company is making its service reachable by hand-held mobile
devices. With its new wireless capability, the company will enable
busy executives to make, approve and check the status of orders
instantly _ all without going back to the office.
</P>
<P>
   The company is also developing regional distribution points to
shorten supply lines to customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say I have taken e-business research to another stage,
and we plan to devote the better part of the next 10 years refining
procurement sites like
</P>
<P>
   hsupply,'' said Kalakota, who was the chair professor of
electronic commerce of the Georgia Research Alliance and director
of the Center for Digital Commerce at Georgia State University. He
has since left those jobs to devote his energy full-time to the new
Internet-based business.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Woodworth, executive managing director of PKF Consulting's
hospitality research group, said the hotel industry has a mixed
experience with e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically, it's let me get three bids for every item that I am
going to buy,'' he said. ``Then I have to evaluate the bid, make a
decision and make the purchase order. That has to be approved, then
I send the bill to accounting and they process it. There are lots
of steps.''
</P>
<P>
   The value of companies like hsupply is obvious in terms of
efficiencies and cost savings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't that many online companies out there, so in my
opinion, they haven't begun to even scratch the surface.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's focus is on large operators and clients, including
US Franchise Systems, the Atlanta-based owner of the Best Inns &AMP;
Suites, Hawthorn Suites and Microtel Inns &AMP; Suites brands.
</P>
<P>
   And Kalakota is the perfect person to jump-start this area of
the lodging industry, said Woodworth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ravi is one of those people who absolutely see the future
before the other 99.9 percent of the rest of us do,'' he said.
``Ravi literally wrote the book on e-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   Kalakota started the business a year ago with four partners, two
of whom had extensive experience in the hotel industry. His
second-in-command is President and Chief Operating Officer Lawrence
W. Hall, former COO of Talus Solutions Inc., a leading revenue
management firm for the hotel, airline, rental car and cruise line
industries. He was also director of hotel systems and
telecommunications worldwide for Sheraton Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The two were brought together by Noro-Moseley Partners, one of
hsupply's venture capital investors. ``I wanted somebody who was an
operator to help me run the company,'' Kalakota said. ``It's been
very complementary. I'm more of the strategist and also responsible
for raising money. Larry's more internally focused on operating the
day-to-day operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Kalakota, who grew up in southern India, received
about $600,000 in critical seed money from angel investors.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the company landed on the radar screens of venture
capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, Noro-Moseley Partners and Mellon Ventures each
invested $2.5 million into the start-up. At the time, hsupply had
eight employees. That's since grown to 70.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Taetle, a general partner with Noro-Moseley, said many
traditional industries, including the once stodgy automotive
industry, are conducting more and more business online.
</P>
<P>
   Taetle said the lodging industry is just the company's first
target. He said the technology can also be applied to other areas
including assisted living, restaurants and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone is embracing the fact that e-commerce is
going to deliver tremendous cost savings because this will simplify
the supply chain under which most of these companies operate,'' he
said. ``Even those industries that are less technologically
receptive than the hotel industry have embraced e-commerce already,
and with the hsupply solution, it's just going to accelerate the
process.''

U.S. AND EUROPE REACH ACCORD ON DATA PRIVACY 
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) By JERI CLAUSING    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The United States and Europe completed the wording on Tuesday
for a data privacy agreement that will put strict new controls on
how American companies collect personal information about European
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which was reached in principle last month, would
require American companies that gather personal information from
Europeans to join so-called ``safe harbor'' programs, under which
they would agree not to gather or use personal information about
European consumers without the consumers' express consent.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, which has been under negotiation for nearly two
years, will be put to the European Union's 15 member states for
preliminary approval March 31, union officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We reached an important stage today,'' the European Union's
negotiator, John Mogg, said at a news conference in Brussels. ``I
feel ready to recommend to authorities that the safe harbor meets
our criteria.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was negotiated in response to a 1998 data privacy
law that gives European Union nations the right to halt certain
information from being sent to countries that do not have adequate
data protection. The United States does not have similar data
protection guidelines. It relies mainly on a system in which
businesses regulate themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The thrust of the agreement deals mainly with transfers of data
between offices of multinational companies. Two more complicated
issues _ how that directive will apply to financial services and
cyberspace _ remain in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Mogg said the European Union decided to move forward with an
agreement that excluded financial services because legislation on
that issue was still pending in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   As for cyberspace, the European Union nations themselves remain
in dispute as to whether the directive applies to businesses
outside of Europe that collect information online from European
consumers, said Gerard de Graf, an official in the union's
Washington office.
</P>
<P>
   But a senior Clinton administration official said that Web sites
would be encouraged to follow the safe-harbor proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This agreement does not try to solve the issue of
jurisdiction,'' the officials said. ``What the safe harbor idea
does is advise our industry as to what to do to conduct business
with Europe and not run afoul of their laws. This advice applies
equally to Web sites,'' who he said would have an ``enormous
advantage'' in Europe by following the rules.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is not expected to take effect until summer, with
the first review of whether or not it meets Europe's expectations
planned a year after that.

POWER PLAY: HOT CARTOON TRIO STARTED IN THE CLASSROOM

<TEXT>
<P>
   It started as a Sherman Oaks animation student's class project.
Now ``The Powerpuff Girls,'' a cartoon series about three
superheroes with a twist, has become a pop-culture phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   The program, the second-most-watched show on the Cartoon
Network, features sugarcoated dynamic divas who keep their city of
Townsville safe from a vast array of comically evil forces.
</P>
<P>
   The twist, however, is that our superheroes first must ask to be
excused from kindergarten for the day before they fly into action
to save the world.
</P>
<P>
   Episodes of the Emmy-nominated ``Powerpuff Girls'' are broadcast
four days a week on the cable channel, which is currently seen in
60.8 million homes. The witty series, which has the look of Japan's
distinctive animation style known as anime and often verges on
surrealism, is popular with male and female viewers of all ages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The girls are basically a combination of cuteness and
toughness,'' says Craig McCracken, 28, creator, writer and director
of the Powerpuffs. ``It's got elements that appeal to boys and
girls, and the relationship between the girls is lifelike: They're
best friends, but they can also be rivals _ just like real
sisters.''
</P>
<P>
   McCracken's inspiration for ``The Powerpuff Girls'' stems from
``The Whoopass Girls,'' a student film he created six years ago
while studying character animation at California Institute of the
Arts (CalArts) in Valencia. His unusual superhero film was selected
for the 1994 Festival of Animation.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, the film evolved into two seven-minute
``Powerpuff Girls'' episodes for Hanna-Barbera and Cartoon
Network's ``World Premiere Toons'' project, where the kindergarten
heroines quickly became viewer favorites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Powerpuff Girls'' debuted in fall 1998 as a separate
weekly series.
</P>
<P>
   As for merchandising, the colorful Powerpuff logo can be spotted
on T-shirts, backpacks, dolls and clocks, while stores including
Aahs and Target have special Powerpuff displays.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show looks different from other cartoons, and I think
that's because the creators are young enough to have been
influenced by anime, the humor of Monty Python and things like
Pokemon,'' says Mike Lazzo, senior vice president of programming
and production at the Cartoon Network. ``There isn't that heavy
Disney influence you see in previous generations. Powerpuff has a
modern sense of humor that's not so based on one-liners, so it can
be conceptual in nature.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the story line, the girls _ Blossom, Bubbles and
Buttercup _ were developed by genetic engineer Professor Utonium,
who set his sights on creating the world's most ``perfect'' girls.
While preparing a concoction of ``sugar and spice and everything
nice,'' he accidentally adds a mysterious fourth ingredient,
Chemical X.
</P>
<P>
   This fateful addition leads to the creation of three toddlers
whose mission in life alternates between fighting crime and winning
at hopscotch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's witty and girly and cute,'' says Powerpuff fan Nicole
Montgomery, 30, of Sherman Oaks. ``There's nothing else quite like
it. It's the first cartoon that features cute girls who kick ass.
There's tongue-in-cheek humor for adults, but kids can like it,
too. It's got appeal for all ages. And there's an added bonus:
People always tell me I look like Buttercup.''
</P>
<P>
   The series is produced by the same Sherman Oaks-based animation
team _ McCracken and Genndy Tartakovsky _ behind the four-time
Emmy-nominated series, ``Dexter's Laboratory.''
</P>
<P>
   With the success of ``The Simpsons,'' ``King of the Hill'' and
``South Park,'' animation has never been more mainstream on TV.
NBC, for example, debuted its new cartoon series, ``God, the Devil
and Bob,'' last Thursday while ABC will soon unveil the animated
``Clerks.''
</P>
<P>
   Each ``Powerpuff Girls'' show is made up of two 11-minute
episodes. On Valentine's Day weekend, the network broadcast an
eight-hour ``Powerpuff'' marathon.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best elements of the program is the lineup of
villains, an array of evil that includes the Gangrene Gang, Mommy
Fearest, the Amoeba Boys, Fuzzy Lumpkins, Roach Coach and Mojo
Jojo. The last is a super-intelligent monkey who hates the human
race because he's low on the evolutionary ladder even though he's a
criminal genius.
</P>
<P>
   The show also sometimes spoofs pop culture, such as in a recent
episode where the girls had to destroy a disco ball in space that
resembled the Death Star.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something fits in a natural way, we'll bring it in,''
McCracken said. ``It's not like the Powerpuff Girls are going to
turn up in `Titanic.' But if you're gonna destroy a giant disco
ball in space, it's got to be the Death Star.''
</P>
<P>
   McCracken said the influence of Japanese animation on
``Powerpuff'' is not pronounced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the best design was done in the '50s, and some of the
best people who do action today are in anime,'' he explained.
``It's not a direct homage, but that element sticks out. I, myself,
really haven't seen that much anime.''
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based Cartoon Network views ``Powerpuff'' as a
valuable brand in terms of merchandising, said Tim Hall, executive
vice president of the network.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real breakout show in terms of licensing,'' he said.
``It appeals to such a broad range of ages that there are lots of
opportunities. The trick is to manage it for the long term. We have
to be careful not to overexpose it and retain the cool flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Powerpuff'' line also includes a new book published by
Scholastic and a pair of home videos due May 30. The videos,
``Monkey See, Doggie Do'' and ``Bubblevicious,'' each feature five
episodes.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes will include a 16-page mini-magazine filled with
games, stickers, interviews and bios of the Powerpuff Girls and
their enemies. &QL;

EX-PRIME MINISTER SAYS RUSSIA SHOULD HALT ALL-OUT CHECHNYA WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Former Russian Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin said
Tuesday that Moscow should put aside its massive military
operations in Chechnya in favor of Israeli-style anti-terrorist
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   The same day Russia mourned 84 of its paratroopers killed in
fighting in Chechnya, Stepashin said that the conventional use of
force that leveled the Chechen capital of Grozny and the Argun
Gorge village of Komsomolskoye was working against the long-term
resolution of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The operations should continue in that heads of terrorist
groups should either be liquidated or captured,'' said Stepashin,
who preceded Vladimir Putin as prime minister. But he added: ``We
must delineate people who suffered from the bandits from the
bandits themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   If this is not done, the conflict could become insoluble, to the
sorrow of Russians and Chechens alike, Stepashin said in an
interview before a speech at Harvard's Kennedy School of
Government.
</P>
<P>
   Russians tried to surpress Chechen separatists three times in
the 20th century _ once after the communist revolution, once after
World War II, and once in the 1990s _ and relations between the two
peoples also were uneasy during czarist times. Generally, there has
been peace only when the Russians have found native Chechens who
they could stomach and who most Chechens would accept as an
alternative to war with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   At present, most of the potential leaders have fled Chechnya and
are reluctant to return because of fear of Russian troops and
security forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over 500,000 Chechens have left their region ... due to what
is going on there,'' Stepashin said. ``These are the
better-trained, better-educated people, people who ran their own
businesses.'' Unless they return, there is little hope either for
peace or reconstruction, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is particularly important for acting Russian president Putin
_ who has defined his Russian leadership by his hard-line stand on
Chechnya _ to shift from general military sweeps of the region to
targeted efforts, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, ``Russians were nonchalant about Chechnya, they
were ready to let it split off,'' Stepahsin said, ``but now people
will say, `come on, we have to finish (the Chechens) off.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Though they differ on Chechnya strategy, Stepashin said in his
speech that he and Putin agree on steps to take to combat the
rampant corruption that is hobbling attempts to modernize and
revitalize the Russian economy.
</P>
<P>
   If Putin rolls to a landslide victory as president on March 26,
he may be free of the political debts that impeded former president
Boris Yeltsin's administration after the 1996 election, Stepashin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin, who is chairman of the corruption commission of
Russia's parliament, said Putin has embraced a national
anti-corruption plan the commission submitted three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   However, Marshall Goldman, professor of Russian economics at
Wellesley College, said corrupt elements in business and
bureaucratic circles will not likely be eradicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are very powerful and will be around a long
time,'' Goldman said. ``It is an important signal if Putin says `We
have to try to do this,' but it is hard to see how he can
succeed.''

 &HT;    Hair to the chief
 &HT;    By Chris Hutchins
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   On March 1, George W. Bush was cornered. David Letterman was
razzing him about international politics. Specifically, about how
the Republican presidential candidate didn't know the leaders of
some foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   The punch line? He asked Bush if he knew the name of the
president of the Hair Club for Men. Bush's response:
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not talking about ... Sy Sperling, are you?''
</P>
<P>
   While the audience laughed in New York, Sperling almost fell off
his treadmill in his Hillsboro Beach home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I flipped out. I couldn't believe it,'' Sperling says. ``I
mean, I know people know who I am, but this was amazing. I guess
advertising works!''
</P>
<P>
   But Sperling started thinking about Bush's response. He started
thinking about hair _ not an uncommon thing to do, in his business.
He made a connection, and got the word out to The Media.
</P>
<P>
   ``There just may be a direct link between having hair and
becoming president,'' says an urgently faxed press release from
Hair Club for Men. ``It's a formula: The candidate with most hair
wins.... It's been documented that since the dawn of the television
age, every elected president since Kennedy, and including Kennedy,
has had hair.''
</P>
<P>
   The two exceptions, Gerald Ford and Lyndon Johnson, ``were not
elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging from this year's primaries, Sperling could be on to
something. Al Gore, despite a ``sandtrap'' in the back, has great
hair _ and balding Bill Bradley is out of the race. And Bush? He's
got more than that shiny-scalped McCain fellow.
</P>
<P>
   Is Sperling's theory fact ... or a follicle fallacy? The Post
called some pundits in Washington to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Bill Clinton did have industrial-strength hair,'' admits
Terry Michael, executive director of the Washington Center for
Politics and Journalism. ``But most presidents in our television
era have had hair problems. Johnson, Nixon, they had hair loss. I
don't think you need hair to be president. And in some cases, you
don't need anything under the hair to be president.''
</P>
<P>
   But Vaughn Ververs, managing editor at The Hotline _ an online
political news service _ disagrees. There could be some truth to
this hair business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physical appearance has so much to do with a candidate,'' he
says. ``In the modern television world, you gotta have a good
image. You gotta look good, man. It's like what Billy Crystal used
to say: `You look mah-velous. It doesn't matter how you feel, baby.
It's how you look that counts.'''
</P>
<P>
   And if the look doesn't work, adapt. Take Al Gore: Our
Washington-types say they've noticed a change in his hair. That
sandtrap has been getting smaller since last fall, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something's going on,'' Ververs says. ``It's shrinking. Either
he's got a great hairstylist, or he's buying a lot of that
hair-in-a-can stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Michaels agrees: ``They've clearly made a conscious decision
that hair is important, that (Gore's) hair loss was somehow
interfering with his voter appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Ratcliff, of the Vice President's Press Office, tried to
quash the rumors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing new to report,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   That's a crock, quips Ververs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Americans knew how all this political stuff really worked,
they'd be mortified. Image is everything here,'' he says. ``And
something as simple as hair could help someone win an election.
Think about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sperling already has. And he should know: He's also a client.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men are hair-conscious,'' he says. ``It's just the nature of
the beast.''

JUDICIAL FINANCIAL REPORTS WILL BE ALLOWED ON INTERNET
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The judges who set policy for the federal judiciary
announced on Tuesday that the judges' annual financial disclosure
statements would no longer be withheld from organizations that want
to put the information on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The action taken by the Judicial Conference of the United States
repudiated a policy adopted in December by its own financial
disclosure committee, which refused to provide the reports to
APBnews.com, an Internet site that requested them. The Web site,
based in New York, then filed a federal lawsuit accusing the
committee and the conference of violating both the First Amendment
and the Ethics in Government Act, which requires public disclosure
of the annual reports.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Sauter, APB's chief executive, said in an interview on
Tuesday that the judges' turnabout marked ``a good day for the
public's right to know about some of the most important people in
our government.'' He said the Internet ``is not just a legitimate
means, but a superior means of disseminating these documents.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Zaid, the Web site's lawyer, said other issues needed to be
resolved before the lawsuit could be dismissed, including APB's
request for a waiver of the $2,500.16 the federal courts'
administrative office charged for copies of all 1,600 disclosure
reports.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on Tuesday following the Judicial
Conference's closed-door meeting at the Supreme Court, the head of
the conference's executive committee, Chief Judge Ralph K. Winter
Jr. of the federal appeals court in New York, said that given the
statutory requirement for public disclosure, it was ``not
sustainable'' to deny access to the reports ``simply because they
are going to be placed on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that under procedures adopted at the meeting Tuesday,
judges who are afraid that the disclosure of personal information _
like children's names or the location of a spouse's workplace _ can
ask that the information be withheld. ``This is a matter of great
concern to an awful lot of judges'' who regularly receive threats
from ``dangerous and deluded individuals,'' Winter said.
</P>
<P>
   But he indicated that information about a judge's actual
financial holdings _ the point of the statute, he noted _ would not
be subject to requests for nondisclosure. In fact, Winter said, the
Judicial Conference is considering ways to get information about
judges' finances before the public on an ongoing basis, rather than
once a year as the Ethics in Government Act provides.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, judges are barred from participating in cases
in which they or immediate family members have a financial
interest. In recent years, journalists and others scrutinizing
lists of judges' holdings have found instances of violations, often
inadvertent but nonetheless embarrassing for the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear from the action on Tuesday that the financial
disclosure committee's response to APB's Internet request had also
become an embarrassment, sharply criticized in Congress and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Winter, who sits on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit, said that while the Judicial Conference's action on
Tuesday was ``not a public relations decision,'' it was nonetheless
true that ``any time the Judicial Conference of the United States
doesn't comply with a statute, it's safe to say it would be
politically disastrous.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, who is the chairman of the
Judicial Conference, was sharply critical of the financial
disclosure committee's action in an internal memo the court
released Tuesday. He said, in effect, that the committee had not
only misinterpreted the law but had overstepped its own authority
within the conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Judicial Conference has 27 members, including a seven-member
executive committee, which voted unanimously to oppose the
financial disclosure committee's position. The vote by the whole
conference Tuesday was 16 to 8.

   NEW YORK _ The former political director of the Teamsters union
was sentenced to three years in prison Tuesday after being
convicted of taking part in a scheme to siphon union money into the
1996 campaign of the Teamsters' former president, Ron Carey.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Griesa of U.S. District Court in Manhattan ordered
the sentence for William Hamilton, the former official, after he
concluded that decades of public service by Hamilton justified
ordering a prison term somewhat less than called for by federal
guidelines. The sentencing guidelines recommend 46 months to 57
months in prison.
</P>
<P>
   In November, a federal jury convicted Hamilton on six counts,
punishable by up to five years each, for helping steer $885,000 in
Teamsters money to liberal groups as part of a scheme in which
donors to those groups later contributed to Carey's campaign.
Federal monitors overturned Carey's 1996 victory over James P.
Hoffa because of the campaign finance fraud, and Hoffa has since
won a rerun election for the union's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   For close to an hour, Hamilton's lawyer, G. Robert Gage Jr.,
implored the judge to depart from the sentencing guidelines as he
emphasized that Hamilton had not benefited financially from the
embezzlement, had parents who were ill and elderly and had spent
decades working in public service.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton led civil rights demonstrations as a student at the
University of Texas, was a top aide to former U.S. Sen. Ralph
Yarborough of Texas, headed Planned Parenthood's Washington office
and was chief of staff at the American Federation of State, County
and Municipal Employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This for me has been degrading and humiliating,'' Hamilton
said in brief, somber remarks, as his two grown children looked on.
``I am deeply ashamed and angry at myself that it has come to
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton said he had such bad memories of the Teamsters when it
was mob-infested and led by Hoffa's father, James R. Hoffa, that he
was desperately eager to insure that Hoffa lost to Carey, whom
Hamilton said he viewed as an honest reformer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to see the union go back to the days of
corruption,'' he said. ``Sometimes you want to do something so
deeply, you do something dumb _ you cross the line.'' He added, ``I
had the best of intentions.''
</P>
<P>
   Stressing the seriousness of the crime, Griesa said: ``It was a
large embezzlement. It was not merely the loss of $885,000 to the
Teamsters, it was conduct which had a very damaging effect on the
union.'' But he said he was lightening the sentence for one reason:
Hamilton's public service. ``He has indeed led an exemplary life,''
the judge said, except for the 1996 campaign-finance scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Six people have been convicted in the Teamsters campaign finance
scheme. Hamilton was the first of theconvicted to receive a prison
term. One other defendant was sentenced to probation, while four
others have not been sentenced.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the prosecutor's office said they were continuing
their investigation. Hamilton has declined to cooperate with the
prosecutors investigating other figures, including Carey and
Richard Trumka, the AFL-CIO's secretary-treasurer.

 &HT;    Ghost Town: North of the River
 &HT;    Editor's Note: Today marks six months since Hurricane Floyd
ravaged an already-soaked eastern North Carolina. The water's gone
now, but many here are still feeling the impact of the storm and
the floods that followed. The Daily Reflector takes a look at how
Greenville and Pitt County residents are coping with Floyd's
aftermath. This is the first part in a seven-part series.

<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ Flooding from Hurricane Floyd illustrated in
dramatic fashion how tenuous one of society's fundamental
frameworks can be.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, brown river water crept across the floodplain
and turned vibrant neighborhoods into ghost towns.
</P>
<P>
   Names such as East Meadowbrook, West Meadowbrook and Pinecrest
Mobile Home Park echo in the wake of the state's worst natural
disaster, when the Tar River and its tributaries escaped their
banks and engulfed homes and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Row upon row, block after block of abandoned houses and mobile
homes bear dingy waterlines marking the deluge's progress on its
destructive journey.
</P>
<P>
   Communities once full of life now sit spookily empty _ no
streetlamps or glowing windows pierce the inky darkness at night.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, it seemed the wiped-out neighborhoods would be lost
forever. That suited city officials, who want the inundated
neighborhoods in the floodplain to remain vacant so they can be
torn down and spared future catastrophes.
</P>
<P>
   But, here and there, a few residents have returned to reclaim
their homes and try to rebuild their communities.
</P>
<P>
   Janie Roberson lives in East Meadowbrook, one of the hardest-hit
areas in Greenville.
</P>
<P>
   She, her husband, Bobby, and the 15-year-old granddaughter who
lives with them fled their Van Dyke Street home when the Tar
overflowed its banks.
</P>
<P>
   Roberson applied for the federal buyout program, which allows
homeowners to sell their flood-damaged homes to the government and
have them leveled for free. That helps the city establish
``conservation spaces'' that can be converted to uses such as boat
docks and nature trails that don't put lives and property in peril
when it floods.
</P>
<P>
   Since applying, however, Roberson has accepted an offer by a
church group to refurbish the home she has lived in for more than
25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Last week a plethora of volunteers was busy inside the home,
nailing up fresh drywall, replacing once-waterlogged fiberglass
insulation and rewiring electrical outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Roberson was beaming _ happy that her house was taking shape _
but that joy was tempered by the lines of vacant homes that
stretched in every direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel lonesome,'' she said. ``I'm missing my neighbors. I
want them to come home like I want to come home. I'm hoping
somebody will come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Houses by themselves do not a neighborhood make, Roberson
realizes. Children playing in yards and biking down streets,
evening strollers chatting as they walk, a little harmless gossip
across a fence _ these transform mere dwellings into a real
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sweet old lady, she'd come to the fence. We'd talk at the
fence,'' Roberson said. ``I miss her.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberson's was one of 1,753 single-family homes, mobile homes,
apartments and duplexes in Greenville that took at least a foot of
water above the floors. Of these, 55 percent were condemned or
deemed uninhabitable.
</P>
<P>
   Monetary losses in the city were estimated at $65.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The church volunteers who were working on Roberson's home had
recently completed a renovation of Floyd Clemons' place on Mumford
Road.
</P>
<P>
   He was busy last week putting the finishing touches on the
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, we're coming back,'' the ordained minister said. ``It was
hard, but we're coming back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to get everybody back in here. Everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemons, who lived in a small trailer set up on his property
while the renovations were being completed, has lived in his home
for more than 20 years and is optimistic about the neighborhood's
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I believe, it's going to be finer than it's ever been
before,'' Clemons said. ``We're going to shake hands with one
another and be good neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   That resolve is frustrating the plans of city officials, who
want the housing developments that were in the 100-year floodplain
to be torn down to make the flood buffer zones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to clean out those neighborhoods that were totally
devastated,'' said Andy Harris, director of planning and community
development. ``Most are participating in the buyout program,
especially in East Meadowbrook.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real possibility that East Meadowbrook could be a
park in the future, a really nice park,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   The money that the city is forced to spend on destroyed and
damaged property is part of the reason for the push, but the
biggest factor is human safety, Harris said. If need be, the city
can take homes to create the conservation spaces, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man will never be able to control disasters,'' Harris said.
``It is a floodplain, and at some point in time, people are going
to recognize that.''
</P>
<P>
   That rankles Clemons, who doesn't want to see East Meadowbrook
disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not giving it up,'' he said of his home.
</P>
<P>
   And if houses around him start coming down under the buyout
program, all the better, Clemons said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That'll just increase my view, give me a good view,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Across Greene Street, the community on West Gum Road is also
slowly coming back to life.
</P>
<P>
   Huey Harrison and his family were driven from the home they had
lived in since 1949.
</P>
<P>
   About 16 families lived in the small settlement before the
floodwaters rolled over the land, floating furniture and personal
mementos and ruining homes inside and out.
</P>
<P>
   A single-wide mobile home, jacked up 3 feet in the air to comply
with the city's post-flood regulations, is the Harrisons' residence
while they wait for demolition crews to take over where the flood
left off. They have a new double-wide ready to be placed on the
lot.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison, who is disabled, sat by himself last week in the quiet
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's lonely,'' he said. ``Our neighborhood was disrupted.''
</P>
<P>
   He misses people walking down the street and children playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a good neighborhood,'' Harrison said. When he returned
to the homestead after the water receded, the area was decimated
``like a plague or something.''
</P>
<P>
   But things are changing on Gum Road. Harrison said about five
families have moved back so far.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks the neighborhood will be reborn, but with different
people.
</P>
<P>
   Roberson is hopeful too, but she is realistic about the final
look of East Meadowbrook.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to be like it was,'' she said. ``It's going to
be like the county almost _ one (house) here and one yonder.''
</P>
<P>
   The loyalty to a neighborhood does have its limits. Roberson
said her granddaughter was a little nervous about moving back to
the home she fled from in fear six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   What if another flood comes, the girl asked her grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll leave,'' Roberson said, ``and we probably won't look
back.''

<P>
   PSKOV, Russia _ Roman Sokolov led a group of Russian snipers in
Chechnya, and looked the part. He was solidly built, with regular
features, close-cropped soldier's hair and threatening V-shaped
brows set over eyes fixed in the flat, detached gaze of a career
warrior.
</P>
<P>
   His face, with its unlined and slightly menacing visage, could
easily be a poster in Russia's determined campaign to win Chechnya
at any cost.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday the image was in a frame that lay atop Captain
Sokolov's zinc coffin in Pskov's soaring Trinity Cathedral. It was
a coffin that, like the seven beside it, was covered in carnations
and tulips and lilies, bedecked in Russian Orthodox icons and wept
over by thousands of mourners.
</P>
<P>
   The eight men were among 84 members of a single Pskov-based
regiment who died in Chechnya early this month, trapped on a
hilltop by thousands of Islamic guerrillas who cut off
reinforcements and, in a gruesome all-night battle, virtually wiped
out a seasoned group of paratroopers. It was one of Russia's worst
defeats in its Chechen campaign, and it has left Pskov, a city of
200,000 on Russia's European border, in shock and bereavement.
</P>
<P>
   In other places, it might be the spark that ignited resentment
against a war that many outsiders see as needlessly brutal and,
ultimately, doomed. What Pskov's mourning Tuesday suggested,
instead, was that Russians, still adrift in their search for a
national identity, have seized on this war as a unifying force, and
wrapped themselves in its grief as in a comforting blanket.
</P>
<P>
   Few if any mourners talked Tuesday about the brutality of
Sokolov's war or the realization, dawning ever so slowly here, that
victory in Chechnya will not be quick or clean or cheap. Rather,
they talked about his heroism in the final hours of a lost cause,
and about his love of military life, and about the 3-year-old
daughter who is still asking her mother to bring daddy home.
</P>
<P>
   And when the service was over, they loaded his coffin on a
military flatbed, mounted his photograph on the back for
identification, and took him to a deserted cemetery for a burial
that was heartbreaking in its wintry sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are heroes,'' Yekaterina Zelinskaya, one of throngs
of women who jammed the cathedral, whispered above the sniffles of
the bereaved. ``They died in battle to defend us, to protect us
against new explosions like the ones last fall. We always knew we
could rely on them. If it is to be necessary, we will fight
terrorism ourselves to save our children.''
</P>
<P>
   The mysterious bombings of apartment blocks last fall, which
killed 300 and were attributed to Chechens but are still unproved,
sealed the Islamic revolt in Russians' minds as a threat to their
nation's existence.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials have since admitted to perhaps 1,500 combat
deaths in the conflict. Some outside experts contend that the true
number may be two or three times that. The military has been loath
to admit its losses, and refused to confirm the extent of the
disaster that befell the Pskov company until nearly a week after
local journalists had reported it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to go to the political officer of my division, and he
concealed the truth from me, even though everyone knew there was a
fierce battle,'' Sokolov's 24-year-old widow, Olga Sokolova, said
in an interview Tuesday. ``People in town knew more than we did in
the division.''
</P>
<P>
   But she and other Russians, almost genetically suspicious of
most government pronouncements, have largely accepted explanations
that the lag in reporting deaths stems from double-checking of
casualty lists.
</P>
<P>
   By design or otherwise, most of Pskov's dead remained Tuesday in
a military mortuary in Rostov, in southwestern Russia, where their
identifications and causes of death were being officially recorded.
Most will be shipped to other hometowns; Pskov, very much a
military city, was a stationing point for service men and women
from around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The eight who came home Tuesday were local boys, and were
mourned as such. Thousands lined the street outside Pskov's massive
1,100-year-old kremlin, in which the centuries-old cathedral
stands. More jammed the kremlin's cobblestone yard and strained
against police lines for a view.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the frigid cathedral, opposite a wall of ancient icons
perhaps 100 feet high, priests and a choir chanted an hourlong
dirge, their frosty breath merging with smoky puffs of incense;
their mantra the names of the dead: Mark, Aleksandr, Vladimir,
Roman, Sergei, Aleksei, Mikhail, Mikhail.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the service marked the start of a long procession to
the waiting military flatbeds, along a cobbled path strewn with red
carnations and lined by soldiers in camouflage, fur hats at their
waists.
</P>
<P>
   It was a heroes' welcome; an outpouring of reverence and grief
that made the familiar arrival of American military coffins at
Wilmington, Del., seem spartan by comparison.

IN A STEP TOWARD MAKING ORGANS FOR HUMAN TRANSPLANTS, SCIENTISTS
CLONE PIGS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Scotland, Va.)   By GINA KOLATA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Scottish company, PPL Therapeutics, announced Tuesday that its
scientists had cloned a pig, creating five identical piglets.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, PPL said, is to use the technology to create
genetically altered pigs whose organs can be transplanted into
humans without being rejected by the human immune system.
</P>
<P>
   PPL provided no details of how the cloning was done or even how
many efforts were needed to succeed. Instead, the company issued a
news release announcing that a pig had been cloned.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Ayares, the vice president of research and development
at PPL, said Tuesday that he hoped the announcement would attract
investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to seek investment partners,'' Ayares said.
``This was a very key milestone that we hope will bring in more
financial interest.''
</P>
<P>
   He said PPL had been talking with drug companies, venture
capitalists and investment bankers.
</P>
<P>
   Ayares, who works at the company's laboratories in Blacksburg,
Va., said PPL hoped to publish the details of the pig cloning in a
scientific journal, either Science or Nature.
</P>
<P>
   It was scientists at PPL, working with others at the Roslin
Institute, who first cloned an adult mammal, a sheep in 1996. They
delayed announcement about the sheep, named Dolly, until the
company had filed for patents, notifying the world with a paper
published in Nature in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, scientists have cloned cattle and mice, and even
clones of clones of mice.
</P>
<P>
   But pigs, Ayares said, ``certainly have been more of a
challenge.'' He said the scientists had to modify every step of the
process to get it to work for pigs.
</P>
<P>
   Like cloning in sheep and cows, Ayares said, the process is
inefficient _ it can take several hundred efforts before a clone is
born.
</P>
<P>
   To clone, scientists take a cell from an adult animal and slip
it into an egg whose own genetic material has been removed. The
genes of the adult cell take over the egg, directing it to divide
and form an embryo. The embryo is placed in the uterus of a
surrogate mother where it grows into a genetically identical copy,
a clone, of the adult whose cell was used.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial value of cloning, scientists say, is as an
effective way to genetically modify animals. Before the adult cell
is used to start cloning, scientists could alter it. Whatever
changes they make would be carried into the cloned animal.
</P>
<P>
   PPL's goal is to make cloned pigs with genetic modifications
that make their organs suitable for transplantation into humans.
Since pig organs are the right size for humans, and since pigs are
inexpensive and easy to breed, scientists have long considered them
as potential donors. The problem is that the immune systems of
humans or other primates react violently to pig organs, destroying
them almost instantly.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John S. Logan, the vice president for research and
development at Nextran, a biotechnology company in Princeton, N.J.
that hoped to develop pigs with organs suitable for transplant,
explained: ``When you transplant a pig organ into a nonhuman
primate, it is rejected immediately. It just turns black before
your eyes, within 30 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason, Logan said, is that pig cells are studded with a
sugar molecule called galactose alpha 1-3 galactose that the human
immune system attacks immediately.
</P>
<P>
   At Nextran, scientists have gotten around the problem by
injecting pig embryos with genes that block the immediate rejection
process. Cloning provides another potential solution, scientists
could eliminate the sugar molecule before using the pig cells to
create clones.
</P>
<P>
   But even when the immediate rejection is prevented, scientists
still have to block a long-term rejection process that takes place
weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really is the limiting factor,'' Logan said.

 &HT;    Recruiters still want face to face contact with applicants
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet may be the hot new way to find workers, but for
recruiter Alan Thornton, there's nothing like eye contact and body
language for sizing up potential hires.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much you can tell from looking people in the eye
and body language is so important in an interview,'' said Thornton,
who works for two Atlanta area recruiting firms. ``You can't get
that over a telephone or the Internet.'' He uses online job boards
to narrow his prospects for technical writers and others with
high-tech backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   A new study on online recruiting backs up Thornton's summation:
The Internet may have the high-tech advantage of reaching a lot of
people, but it's still no match for old-fashioned, face-to-face
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   With online recruiting projected to become a $2.5 billion
business by 2003, more recruiters and human resource professionals
at small and large companies are using the Internet to find
workers. But many of them are frustrated by the impersonal feel of
online job boards, according to the study conducted by Yankelovich
Partners. The study was commissioned by kforce.com, an online
staffing service that polled 300 human resources managers at large
U.S.-based businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They still place tremendous value on face-to-face interactions
in the hiring process,'' said David Dunkel, chief executive of
kforce.com.
</P>
<P>
   But that hasn't stopped companies from taking a chance on the
Internet _ and getting results, however mixed:
</P>
<P>
   About 75 percent of the companies surveyed post jobs on
third-party Web sites, such as Monster.com, Atlanta's
computerjobs.com or headhunter.net. Job search Web sites number in
the hundreds. Conversely, because of the Internet's far-reaching
exposure, companies complained that they're inundated with resumes,
many of which aren't that impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, two out of five companies surveyed said they will
pour more money into online recruiting during the next year. More
than half of the companies not using their Web sites for recruiting
plan to do so in the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Large businesses had an average of two in-house recruiters
dedicated solely to online job recruiting. Most large firms list
jobs on their own Web site vs. an outside job board. There are
thousands of recruiting sites, according to Charlene Li, an
Internet analyst at Cambridge, Mass.-based Forrester Research. The
average fee for posting a job is about $100 a month, Li said.
</P>
<P>
   The practice of companies using their own sites will increase in
the future, says Carl Van Horn of the John J. Heldrich Center for
Workforce Development at Rutgers University. Van Horn noted that
many of the Fortune 500 firms he deals with said they're getting
about a fifth of their new hires through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They still talk to them'' face to face, Van Horn said. But
``they identify them on the Internet. Five years ago, that was
practically zero. It's going to continue to increase because people
want it and employers will push for it.''
</P>
<P>
   One in 10 new hires at the companies surveyed was a direct
result of online recruiting. Most of the hires were for permanent
jobs as opposed to contract work.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, the study found, also has become the great
equalizer between small and large firms.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Steve Derezinski.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday at 3 p.m., Derezinski went online to look for software
developers for his start-up company called smallbizplanet.com, a
Midtown-based online information service for small businesses. By
4:30, he had five prospects to his posting, ``two of which are
excellent.''
</P>
<P>
   He's already hired two people using the Internet and will likely
make another Internet hire in the next couple of weeks, if e-mail
responses and interviews work out. He has used traditional
recruiters but now prefers online recruiting. With traditional
recruiters, you end up ``interviewing the interviewer,'' and that
takes time away from finding workers. The Internet gets faster
results, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies on the Internet, regardless of size, are able to
compete more effectively,'' he said. ``Anybody who's smart enough
to leverage the Internet to their advantage is going to be more
competitive.''

<P>
   Just this week, Scientific-Atlanta, a Norcross-based developer
of interactive digital cable TV boxes, launched a nationwide search
for engineers, sales and marketing people via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who work at Scientific-Atlanta are part of an
Internet-savvy software environment mixed with the successful
digital interactive platforms and networks the company has built
for more than a decade,'' Scientific-Atlanta Chief Executive
Officer Jim McDonald said in a statement.

   Online recruiting is forecast to grow rapidly in the next two to
three years as more job seekers go online to speed up their job
search and companies respond in kind, says Van Horn of Rutgers.
</P>
<P>
   The Rutgers study of American workers last month found that
workers ages 18-20 _ the chief source of workers in the future _
are the most likely to use the Internet to find a job as opposed to
workers over the age of 50.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge growth potential in e-recruiting strategies,
because the access to computers is expanding and young people are
the ones most likely to be looking for jobs,'' Van Horn said.

LEE'S SUMMIT DOCTOR RECOMMENDS TECHNICIAN ALSO BE INVESTIGATED BY
FBI 
</HEADLINE>
 TISSUE-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Lee's Summit, Mo., doctor at the center of an FBI
probe of fetal tissue marketing has surfaced long enough to ask
that a key accuser be investigated for ``corporate espionage.''
</P>
<P>
   Pathologist Miles Jones wrote letters Monday to Attorney General
Janet Reno and FBI Director Louis Freeh asking that medical
technician Lawrence Dean Alberty Jr. be investigated for giving
private medical records to an anti-abortion group that paid him
more than $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Life Dynamics _ a Texas organization for which Alberty spied
while employed by Jones at an Overland Park, Kan., clinic _ should
also be investigated, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violations of patient and corporate confidentiality are
serious offenses,'' Jones said in letters he provided to The Kansas
City Star. Jones said he thought the offenses were a ``serious case
of corporate espionage.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones' letters mark his first public reaction to allegations of
possible fetal tissue profiteering.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to be interviewed by a reporter, but he implied
Tuesday in a two-paragraph e-mail to The Star that the allegations
were racially motivated. Jones, 47, is black.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh to be in Salem or under the spreading Southern oak tree,''
he wrote, apparently referring to witch hunts and lynchings.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Jones did not answer a subpoena from a U.S. House
subcommittee that held a hearing on whether fetal tissue and organs
were being marketed in violation of federal law. He could face a
contempt of Congress charge.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Justice Department said Tuesday she didn't
know whether Reno and Freeh had received Jones' letters. Alberty's
attorney, David Stout of Kansas City, Mo., declined to comment on
Jones' allegations.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI in Kansas City is investigating the removal and
marketing of fetal tissue at Comprehensive Health, an Overland Park
clinic affiliated with Planned Parenthood of Kansas and
Mid-Missouri. Tissue is provided for research in treatment of
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Health and Environment Subcommittee called for
the probe last week after Jones told an undercover ABC News
reporter that the harvesting of fetal brains, kidneys, livers and
other organs can bring ``what you can sell it for.''
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, fetal organs can be donated but not sold.
Reasonable costs can be recovered for staff, facility and
transportation costs. Jones' company, Opening Lines, had a price
brochure for fetal organs.
</P>
<P>
   Opening Lines was under contract with Planned Parenthood for
about 10 weeks in 1998 to remove fetal tissue and organs.
</P>
<P>
   Alberty worked for Opening Lines to help remove and ship tissue.
He did similar work at the clinic for a previous contractor from
Georgia, Anatomic Gift Foundation. Planned Parenthood ended both
contracts and now has no one doing tissue removal.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony to the House subcommittee last week, Alberty
admitted accepting more than $10,000 in payments and $11,000 in
travel expenses from Life Dynamics, to gather information about
fetal tissue work.
</P>
<P>
   Alberty said he had become horrified at the procedures and
decided to help expose the practice.
</P>
<P>
   Alberty wore a woman's disguise and videotaped about five hours
of interviews with Life Dynamics about fetal tissue being removed
from viable fetuses and sold. Alberty admitted under oath and in an
affidavit, however, that he made some false statements on the tape
and knew little about fetal viability or sales.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to relating what he saw in the clinic, Alberty
admitted taking some Anatomic Gift documents marked
``confidential'' that listed procedures used in removing fetal
organs, types of organs ordered and names of researchers. He turned
them over to Life Dynamics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that when investigated, evidence of violations of
federal law will be uncovered,'' Jones wrote Reno and Freeh.
</P>
<P>
   Alberty also said in a deposition that he provided Jones with
the names of potential clients, some of the researchers who had
previously used Anatomic Gift.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer specializing in corporate crime said Tuesday that
someone in Alberty's situation could face investigation but that
espionage would likely not be the charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly are other things that can be considered when
employees who owe a duty to a corporation in good faith, breach
that good faith,'' said St. Louis lawyer Burt Shostak, chairman of
the White Collar Crime Committee of the National Association of
Criminal Defense Attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could be talking about mail fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy,
stealing by deceit,'' Shostak said. ``Whether it rises to level of
a criminal act is for a prosecutor to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Anatomic Gift, now located in Maryland, sued Alberty in federal
court in Kansas City last year for breaching a confidentiality
agreement. Company attorney Fay Clayton said Tuesday the lawsuit
has been settled, and she would not say if Alberty should be
prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope Mr. Alberty has learned his lesson, I certainly hope he
has,'' Clayton said. ``Now, if Mr. Jones would only learn his.''
</P>
<P>
   The fetal tissue probe is expected to come up again today when
the House Commerce Committee votes on whether to recommend the
House hold Jones in contempt for failing to appear before its
subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Should the House approve a contempt charge, the Justice
Department could seek to indict Jones and have him arrested.

<P>
   QUESTION: What's an Oscar really worth?
</P>
<P>
   ANSWER: It depends on how you look at it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 400: &LR;  &QL;  That's the sum that R.S. Owens and Co., the
Chicago-based
manufacturer, spends to create each of the 13.5-inch-tall,
8.5-pound statuettes. An Oscar is made of brittania and is coated
with layers of copper, nickel, silver, and, finally, 24-karat gold
electroplate.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; $50 MILLION: &LR;  &QL;  The industry trade publication Variety estimates
that's
how much the major studios will spend promoting their Oscar
hopefuls this year. Expenses for these blitzes now include ads in
Variety and The Hollywood Reporter, parties and private screenings,
plus thousands of videotapes and DVDs dispatched to the 5,500
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1955-56, the producers of ``Marty'' actually spent more
money on the film's Oscar campaign ($400,000) than they did to make
the movie ($350,000). The tactic worked: ``Marty'' won the
best-picture award.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; $64 MILLION: &LR;  &QL;  How much last year's winner for best picture,
``Shakespeare in Love,'' garnered in additional revenue following
the Oscar nominations. The amount represented a 177 percent
increase beyond the $36 million it took in prior to the
nominations.
</P>
<P>
   $20 MILLION PER FILM: That's what Tom Hanks now commands after
having won two best-actor awards (``Philadelphia'' in 1995 and
``Forrest Gump'' in 1996.) Other members of the $20 Million Club
include Jim Carrey, Harrison Ford, John Travolta, Brad Pitt,
Leonardo DiCaprio, and Julia Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   $24 MILLION: The 1998 best-picture champ, ``Titanic,'' earned
that amount in additional box-office revenue for each _ yes, each _
of its record 11 Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   _ $2 MILLION: Not all winners have been able to cash in on their
Oscar gold in a big way. Mel Gibson's ``Braveheart'' won best
picture in 1995, but the movie's box-office revenue increased only
from $68 million to $70 million as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Perhaps because the film earned most of its money when it
was released in May and then re-released in December to create
Oscar buzz. By the time the Academy Awards rolled around in March
1996, most interested moviegoers had already seen the film.
</P>
<P>
   $1.54 MILLION: The most ever paid at auction (on June 12, 1999)
for an Oscar. This was the price for the statuette awarded to
``Gone With the Wind'' for best picture in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   $0: Since 1950, Oscars have been awarded for display purposes
only. Winners must sign an agreement conferring actual ownership to
the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts &AMP; Sciences. &QL;

GEORGIA TAKES AIM AT NEW YORK IN CENSUS PROMOTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ten years ago, Georgia missed out on a new
congressional seat when state leaders did not bother to persuade
enough residents to turn in their census forms. This year, the
easygoing Southern gentility is gone. The state is playing
hardball, and the opponent is a familiar one.
</P>
<P>
   ``When your census form comes, fill it out and mail it in,''
says Georgia Gov. Roy E. Barnes, in a new statewide television ad.
``Or Georgia money will be educating New York children for another
10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The state lost $2 billion because 140,000 Georgians did not fill
out their forms, Barnes says in the advertisement _ ``money that
should have come to Georgia for schools and health care. Instead,
it's gone to other states _ from Connecticut to California.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most aggressive ``get out the forms'' efforts in
the country, the state is spending nearly $1.4 million on
television, radio and newspaper ads, and on phone banks, to make
sure that residents mail back their census forms this year. And
what better way to stimulate action than to pretend as if the state
is in direct competition with New York?
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it's baseball or broadcasting, politics or plays, New
York is the standard we all measure ourselves against,'' said
Howard Mead, the governor's communications director, explaining the
advertisement's geographical choice. In fact, New York has always
been the chosen archetype of everything that Georgia is not, and
the ad's creators knew exactly what its effect would be.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Georgia sat back while other states spent money to push
their residents to raise their hands and be counted, said Robert
Giacomini, the research director of Georgia Tech's State Data and
Research Center, which was hired by the state as its lead agency
for improving Georgia's census count. As a result, it had an
undercount that the Census Bureau estimated at 2.1 percent, higher
than the national average of 1.6 percent (but not nearly as bad as
the 2.7 percent in Texas and California, two states with
hard-to-count Hispanic populations). Although Georgia gained a
congressional seat that year, it would have had another one if the
extra 140,000 residents had been counted, Giacomini said.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the state's enormous growth guarantees it another
seat, but it believes it can get two with an aggressive census
effort. The governor formed a committee, the Legislature approved
the money, and when Giacomini and his colleagues began talking to
people around the state, they realized the most effective way to
stimulate participation was to point out who would win if Georgia
loses. The next step was ridiculously obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is the traditional rivalry,'' Giacomini said. ``It
has the biggest city, the powerhouse everyone looks at. It just
stands for all those northern states with better counts than
ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's undercount was worse than New York state's, which was
estimated at 1.5 percent. (In New York City, one of the
hardest-to-count cities in the country, the bureau missed an
estimated 3.2 percent.) But in an emotional campaign like this one,
the numbers do not really matter. What's important is getting
across the sense that Georgia is losing out, preferably to a hated
rival.
</P>
<P>
   People here have not forgotten the moment in 1997 when New York
state officials removed the Georgia flag from the Capitol in Albany
because it contained the Confederate battle symbol, which was
followed by the removal of the New York flag from the Capitol in
Georgia. There has also been the frequent jostling between New
York's baseball teams and the Atlanta Braves, punctuated by John
Rocker's outburst.
</P>
<P>
   And in Tuesday morning's Atlanta Constitution, Ted Turner was
asked whether he ever considered moving his Turner Broadcasting
System to New York. His derisive response: ``New York? It's bad
enough to go up there and visit.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the technique is a bit ancient and a bit cynical, the
stakes are enormous. PricewaterhouseCoopers, which recently studied
the matter for the Census Monitoring Board, an oversight committee,
estimated that half the states could lose a total of $9.1 billion
if the Census Bureau undercounts people at the same rate as in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   And, because the number of House seats is fixed at 435, any seat
gained by one state during reapportionment is lost by another. New
York and Connecticut, to cite two states named by Barnes, are
considered likely to lose two seats and one seat, respectively,
according to a projection by the Republican National Committee. At
the same time, Georgia, Texas and Arizona are the best bets to gain
two seats each.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many states are stepping up their efforts to
produce a larger count, supplemented by the Census Bureau's own
unprecedented $103 million advertising budget. California has
allocated $24.5 million in state money for census ads. Nevada is
spending $700,000. New York's budget of $347,000 is rather paltry
by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, having spent almost nothing 10 years ago, is leaving
little to chance this year. About 80 percent of its counties now
have census count committees. Pastors have been urged to use their
pulpits to get congregants to fill out their forms. The Rev. Jesse
Jackson has taped a radio ad for use on black stations. And Barnes,
in another radio ad, has even begun to imitate Regis Philbin.
</P>
<P>
   ``So here's your next question,'' he says, in yet another
imitation of Philbin's television quiz show. ``What costs nothing
but pays dividends for years? Your census forms. Fill it out and
mail it in. That's my final answer.''

AT LEAST YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT LONG LINES FOR GASOLINE 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If soaring gasoline prices have made you fretful, look on the
bright side: At least you're able to buy all you want without
tedious waits for pumps that may or may not be pumping when you get
there.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that's the way it was a generation ago when foreign oil
producers created shortages that not only spurred prices but also
created for some Americans the now unthinkable plight of gasoline
being temporarily unavailable at any price.
</P>
<P>
   About half the U.S. population, however, is too young to have a
memory of those terrible times. This helps explain why so many
Americans fail to appreciate how much worse the current
unpleasantness could be. That it's not worse is due to a valuable
lesson Americans learned from the '70s oil disruptions. What we
learned is that government's well-intentioned marketplace
intrusions can't abrogate the law of supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
   A generation ago, an oil shortage was created by major exporters
curbing and withholding supply. This move caused prices to rise and
thus should have resulted in more production from domestic
producers. It didn't happen, though, because laws and regulations
designed to ``protect'' Americans from high fuel prices prevented
alternative producers from maximizing profits.
</P>
<P>
   When this restrictive structure was dismantled, the market began
to work again, and within a few years Americans had all the gas
they wanted at steadily declining prices. As the '90s drew to a
close, gas prices reached their lowest inflation-adjusted level
since cars became a significant factor in American life.
</P>
<P>
   The market was working as intended when prices were falling
because of plentiful supply. It's also working as gas prices are
rising. The price mechanism is the most critical component of a
market economy. It's the signal that keeps supply and demand in
relative balance.
</P>
<P>
   The fuel market is tight because overseas producers again have
decided to curb production. When they cut output, however, prices
were historically low. This meant it was going to take a fairly
long time for prices to go up enough to encourage domestic oil
producers to increase production.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a rough couple of decades for the U.S. oil industry.
Low prices have put a lot of players out of business and caused
others to abandon development of new supply sources. This won't
change until the price mechanism signals to the oil patch there's a
reasonable expectation of long-term decent profits from producing

</P>
<P>
   If political leaders can resist the urge to try to ``fix'' the
problem by delivering fuel to voters at below-market prices, the
situation will sort itself out. It might not sort itself out to the
satisfaction of those who think cheap gas is a birthright, but
there are worse things than relatively expensive gasoline. One is
inadequate supplies of gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, expensive is a relative thing. Motorists in Europe and
Japan have been paying $4 or more a gallon for a number of years.
They've adjusted, it seems, without experiencing the end of the
world as we know it.
</P>
<P>
   America's run of cheap gas was a good one, but certainly not
something that could have been expected to last forever.

<TEXT>
<P>
   QUESTION: What's an Oscar really worth?
</P>
<P>
   ANSWER: It depends on how you look at it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 400: &LR;  &QL;  That's the sum that R.S. Owens and Co., the
Chicago-based
manufacturer, spends to create each of the 13.5-inch-tall,
8.5-pound statuettes. An Oscar is made of brittania and is coated
with layers of copper, nickel, silver, and, finally, 24-karat gold
electroplate.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; $50 MILLION: &LR;  &QL;  The industry trade publication Variety estimates
that's
how much the major studios will spend promoting their Oscar
hopefuls this year. Expenses for these blitzes now include ads in
Variety and The Hollywood Reporter, parties and private screenings,
plus thousands of videotapes and DVDs dispatched to the 5,500
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1955-56, the producers of ``Marty'' actually spent more
money on the film's Oscar campaign ($400,000) than they did to make
the movie ($350,000). The tactic worked: ``Marty'' won the
best-picture award.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; $64 MILLION: &LR;  &QL;  How much last year's winner for best picture,
``Shakespeare in Love,'' garnered in additional revenue following
the Oscar nominations. The amount represented a 177 percent
increase beyond the $36 million it took in prior to the
nominations.
</P>
<P>
   $20 MILLION PER FILM: That's what Tom Hanks now commands after
having won two best-actor awards (``Philadelphia'' in 1995 and
``Forrest Gump'' in 1996.) Other members of the $20 Million Club
include Jim Carrey, Harrison Ford, John Travolta, Brad Pitt,
Leonardo DiCaprio, and Julia Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   $24 MILLION: The 1998 best-picture champ, ``Titanic,'' earned
that amount in additional box-office revenue for each _ yes, each _
of its record 11 Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   _ $2 MILLION: Not all winners have been able to cash in on their
Oscar gold in a big way. Mel Gibson's ``Braveheart'' won best
picture in 1995, but the movie's box-office revenue increased only
from $68 million to $70 million as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Perhaps because the film earned most of its money when it
was released in May and then re-released in December to create
Oscar buzz. By the time the Academy Awards rolled around in March
1996, most interested moviegoers had already seen the film.
</P>
<P>
   $1.54 MILLION: The most ever paid at auction (on June 12, 1999)
for an Oscar. This was the price for the statuette awarded to
``Gone With the Wind'' for best picture in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   $0: Since 1950, Oscars have been awarded for display purposes
only. Winners must sign an agreement conferring actual ownership to
the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts &AMP; Sciences. &QL;

HOW BIG A PART OF GDP ARE OFFICE POOLS? MAKE A BET?  
(HM)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOBERT E. ABUEVA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't try calling Jake Williams right now about his company's
product line. Williams, a manager at Furnimex, a distributor of
home textiles based in Dallas, is working furiously against a
deadline of noon Thursday to complete a special project.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday morning, faxes began piling up on his desk, his voice
mail light started blinking and messages began clogging his e-mail.
As in years past, Williams is spending much of his workday
confirming the orders pouring in and collecting cash from
customers.
</P>
<P>
   But not all of them are Furnimex customers. Williams organizes
an office betting pool for the granddaddy event of them all: the
National Collegiate Athletic Association basketball championship
playoffs, a.k.a. March Madness, with 64 of the nation's top men's
teams battling it out throughout the next two and a half weeks.
</P>
<P>
   And here is the twist: Williams says his role as numbers man is
good for business, good for workplace morale and even good for his
family life since he enlists the help of his wife and son in the
tabulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets everyone excited and talking around the water cooler,
regardless of their function and position in the company,''
Williams said. It is also a lifeline to customers old and new, he
said. When his previous employer moved him from New York to Dallas
12 years ago, he said, ``Everyone identified me as  &UR; the &LR;  sports
fan, and, as many colleagues remained in New York, they wanted to
know whether the tradition would be maintained.''
</P>
<P>
   They did not have to worry. Even though he took a job with
Furnimex six years ago, the office pool he organizes around March
Madness gives him a chance to renew old contacts. ``It's an annual
high moment that so many busy partners and friends look forward to,
year in and year out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of business consultants agree with him. Many corporate
bosses have long tolerated office pools on sporting events and
award shows as harmless diversions. But some say the pools are much
more than that because they increase camaraderie and encourage
interaction in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The betting pool, as a shared experience, gives co-workers an
excuse to see each other face to face in a world where technology
has put efficiency, but distance, in our work relationships,'' said
Bob Nelson, a consultant and author of ``1001 Ways To Take
Initiative at Work'' (Workman, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   Matt Weinstein, founder of Playfair, a management consulting
firm in Berkeley, Calif., and author of ``Work Like Your Dog''
(Villiard, 1999), says betting pools can make the workplace more
fun _ an important consideration for retaining employees in the
current job market. They can also add a light touch to otherwise
humdrum activities. ``Pools run the gamut from what time the UPS
deliveryman will arrive to how many pie charts a vice president
will use during his presentation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Williams' pools have sometimes produced results that warm the
hearts of even the losers. Once, a secretary who was eight months
pregnant took the top prize. Another year, it was a 15-year-old
high school sophomore, the son of one of Williams' customers. And
once it was a top industry executive, who split the money among
three clerks who had entered losing sheets.
</P>
<P>
   For Peter Bielby, a design engineer in Ann Arbor, Mich., betting
pools are just part of the work landscape. ``Pools exist everywhere
I've worked _ Texas, Georgia and now back in Michigan,'' he said.
``People look forward to it. It acts as a morale booster.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   From the opening tap at the NCAA tournament's first-round game
Thursday afternoon until the April 3 championship in Indianapolis,
millions of workers with a stake in the outcome will be monitoring
each game, rooting for the ``right'' team combination. As in years
past, many will crowd into office conference rooms with television
sets or flip on a radio on the factory floor to catch the action.
</P>
<P>
   The entry fee of $10 a sheet for Williams' pool has not changed
since its inception, he said. The number of participants has grown,
though, to 450 last year. That is a pot of $4,500, with the top
winner getting $3,000; the first runner-up, $900, and the second,
$600. This is still small potatoes compared with Wall Street pots,
which investment bankers say can go to five or even six figures. In
all, it has been estimated that $6 billion changes hands annually
in office pools around the nation, led by the Super Bowl and March
Madness in dollar volume.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The volume is big enough to support a few software packages and
a growing number of World Wide Web sites. The March Madness
Tournament Tracker, for example, which can be downloaded from
sportsdatatech.com, can track and rank up to 1,000 entries, saving
organizers endless paperwork _ an efficiency the bosses of America
no doubt appreciate. Williams, though, happily remains in the Dark
Ages, keeping score by hand.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Web sites like Gamesville.com and Easypool.com are
for an assortment of pools. And the NCAA Web site,
ncaachampionships.com, offers printouts of team seeds and pairings
as well as updates.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before the Final Four games on April 1, Williams will work out
all the possibilities and advise the front-runners of their chances
of winning. ``This is always fun because loyalties can change in an
instant, even against one's alma mater,'' he said. It also becomes
a chance for Williams to set up appointments with Furnimex
customers in the pool once the tournament ends.
</P>
<P>
   So, does he face an emotional letdown when the madness is over?
Not really. He and other regulars in the NCAA pool are already
preparing for the draft next month for fantasy, or Rotisserie,
baseball.

TIBET (HOLD THE SHANGRI-LA)  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 19) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BARBARA STEWART   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the past decade, there have been three lavish Hollywood
movies about Tibet and its Buddhist monks, several documentaries
and a few lower-budget independent films, the latest of which is
``The Cup,'' about a monastery in India whose young Tibetan monks
are swept up in a passion for the World Cup soccer final.
</P>
<P>
   To Tibetans expatriates, Hollywood's portrayals of Tibet _ like
Bernardo Bertolucci's ``Little Buddha'' (1993) and Martin
Scorsese's ``Kundun'' (1997) _ are overflowing with exaggerated
reverence, with heavy-handed depictions of Tibetans, especially
Tibetan monks, as solemn, holy and kind instead of as ordinary
people who quarrel and joke around.
</P>
<P>
   Jamyang Norbu, a Tibetan immigrant and writer living in
Tennessee, said: ``In the West, the response to Tibetan culture is
so worshipful and romantic. There are elements in Tibetan culture
that have all this magical, medieval stuff that Westerners love.
The New Age thing. The Tibetan thing has style _ the color, the
costumes. To a great extent, we exist only in the imagination of
Western fantasists.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering the Hollywood versions of Tibet and Buddhist monks,
Norbu considers ``The Cup,'' which opened in late January, to be a
fresh breeze. In it young monks break the rules, sneaking out at
night and snickering over Victoria's Secret catalogues and snapping
wisecracks during kitchen duty. ``It has a sense of fun and a sense
of reality,'' Norbu said. ``It's not trying to make some huge
statement, but it's truth-telling. There's a sense of sadness about
it, deliberately underplayed.''
</P>
<P>
   The director of ``The Cup,'' Khyentse Norbu, a high-ranking
Buddhist lama from Bhutan (who is no relation to Jamyang Norbu),
knows the foibles of young monks well, having taught in monasteries
in Bhutan and India for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The romantic idea should stop now,'' Khyentse Norbu said. ``In
the West, people have higher expectations and see Tibetans as holy
and high _ people who don't eat and sleep. Sooner or later, they're
going to be disappointed. I'm trying to demystify Tibetans.''
</P>
<P>
   To his mind, ``Kundun,'' about the current Dalai Lama's early
life in Lhasa, is the best of the Hollywood takes on Tibet. It
recreated the grandeur of the Potala Palace, the former seat of the
Dalai Lama, as well as some of the political machinations of the
Chinese government, and included bloody scenes of the Chinese
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The myth of a magical Tibet inhabited by otherworldly holy men
was first popularized by ``Lost Horizon,'' the Depression-era hit
that starred Ronald Colman. In it, some Englishmen are downed in a
plane crash in the Himalayas. They are rescued by residents of
Shangri-La, a place of constant serenity, where wise lamas offer
the visitors proper cups of tea and urbane philosophical
conversation _ in English.
</P>
<P>
   Campy as it now seems, ``Lost Horizon'' struck a deep chord in
the West, creating a myth that present-day Tibetans living in the
West are still grappling with.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shangri-La was one of the West's most powerful utopian
images,'' said Orville Schell, whose book, ``Virtual Tibet:
Searching for Shangri-La From the Himalayas to Hollywood'' (Henry
Holt), is due out this spring. ``It was Tibet but not too Tibet _
awfully clean, with libraries filled with the great works of
Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 10 years, the Dalai Lama's books have appeared
regularly on best-seller lists, numerous Tibetan lamas have taught
Buddhist philosophy and meditation in the West and Hollywood has
become entranced with Tibet. But, according to Schell, as well as
to several Tibetan filmmakers and film buffs, all three Hollywood
extravaganzas _ including the 1997 ``Seven Years in Tibet'' _ bore
traces of the daydreams of ``Lost Horizon.''
</P>
<P>
   The movies seem to view Tibetans and Buddhist monks through a
veil of awe _ as a devout Catholic might look at the pope.
``Slavishly reverent,'' said Schell.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For Thupten Tsering, the co-director of ``Windhorse,'' a 1999
low-budget movie about a family damaged by the Chinese regime that
was shot surreptitiously in Tibet, the reverence and exaggerated
respect of the Hollywood productions have an undercurrent that it
is a bit insulting. ``People assume that if you are Tibetan, you
are peaceful and polite and smiley,'' he said. ``They are imposing
this Shangri-La fantasy myth on Tibetans. They see Tibetans as
cute, sweet, warmhearted. I tell people, when you cut me, I bleed
just like you.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with ``Windhorse'' and ``The Cup,'' another realistic
portrayal was a low-budget 1998 documentary, ``The Saltmen of
Tibet,'' about nomads and their annual three-month trek with their
yaks to remote salt lakes for the bags of salt that provide their
living. Both ``The Cup'' and ``The Saltmen of Tibet'' have a subtle
undercurrent of mourning for the loss of their culture and country.
And both show Tibetans as people who laugh and joke readily and
have a sharp wit.
</P>
<P>
   Gesar Mukpo, 26, a Tibetan-American and an aspiring filmmaker,
resents the Hollywood stereotype of the holiness of the Tibetans.
``How many Italian movies do you see that (italics)aren't(end
italics) about the Mafia?'' he said. ``I don't want every Tibetan
movie to be about holy people. I'd like to make a Tibetan action
movie. It would be interesting to see ordinary Tibetans flourishing
back in warring times.''
</P>
<P>
   The enthusiastic reception of ``The Cup'' is encouraging, he
said. Perhaps the time will soon be ripe for Mukpo to attempt a
film about the warriors of Tibet, a kind of Tibetan ``Braveheart.''
Another idea he has is a film about a tulku _ a person who is
thought to be a saint in a previous life _ who rebels against the
monastic life.
</P>
<P>
   During the '70s Jamyang Norbu lived in Darjeeling, India, where
his family escaped to when he was a child, and he remembers how
shocked Western tourists were when they saw Tibetan teenagers with
guitars playing Jimi Hendrix songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to insist that our religion is everything,'' he
said. ``When Tibetans get together, we drink a little too much, we
sing songs _ Bob Dylan, maybe _ and they don't like that.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he hopes that ``The Cup'' will help rid Hollywood of its
visions of Tibetans as wise mystics, and open the doors to a
broader view of Tibet and Tibetan Buddhism that can convey the
depth of the Tibetans' religious views, their sadness over exile
and the Chinese occupation of their land, and their day-to-day
humor.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, he said, he could then go to Hollywood movies
about Tibet without fear of embarrassment over their solemn
pieties. The low point, for him, was a scene in ``Seven Years in
Tibet,'' in which a frowning monk scolds the Brad Pitt character
for carelessly killing some earthworms. `Those earthworms could
have been your mother,''' said Norbu, repeating the lines of the
movie in a voice heavy with sarcasm. ``Please, no more hurting!''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like `Saturday Night Live,''' said Norbu. ``Every
Tibetan I know shudders over that scene.''

ALBRIGHT URGES INDIA TO CURB NUCLEAR WEAPONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Setting a high bar for President Clinton's
approaching trip to South Asia, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said Tuesday that India must curb its nuclear weapons
program before relations with the United States can be markedly
improved.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said the nuclear brinksmanship represented by the 1998
weapons tests by India and then Pakistan, two long-time enemies,
were ``a historic mistake.'' While India's nuclear weapons are not
a direct threat to the United States, she said, ``we do regard
(nuclear) proliferation anywhere as our No. 1 security concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``And for this reason, we must accept that significant progress
in this area is necessary before India and the United States can
realize fully the vast potential of our relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright's comments, what the international relations Ph.D.
called ``a wonky speech,'' were delivered to an Asia Society
briefing tied to Clinton's trip to India, Bangladesh and Pakistan.
The president departs Sunday and is expected to be gone a week.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions set by Albright, although hardly surprising,
could have a dampening effect on India's attitude toward Clinton's
visit, the first in 22 years by a U.S. president to the world's
most populous democracy. A U.S. president has not been to Pakistan
in almost 31 years and had never visited Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have questioned whether Clinton's visit to the region
should be focused on nuclear arms policy, an approach that has been
a hallmark of the president's frequent international travels during
his seven years in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president needs to avoid the temptation ... to shape the
agenda with both India and Pakistan around nuclear goals,'' said
Richard Haas, director of international programs at the Brookings
Institution. While important, he said, ``it can't be a gateway''
for the U.S. relationship with either nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``These countries are not about to get out of the nuclear
business,'' said Haas, a National Security Council official in the
Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said that the United States and India ``have not yet
found a way to create sufficient common ground on these issues. But
I'm convinced that our relationship today has the strength and
breadth to keep working through our differences and find a way
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   She called on India to recognize that its nuclear program could
spark a continentwide arms race and military buildup, and has
repercussions outside of its long-tortured relations with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prudence and clarity in India's plans and doctrines could
yield great benefits, for a pattern of steeply rising defense
budgets in Asia would serve neither the continents security
interests nor its development needs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said the United States seeks ``a qualitatively
different and better relationship with India, not a simple return
to the status quo before the tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our ability to attain this goal will depend largely on what
India does. ... Our approach to nonproliferation is global. We
cannot abandon it simply because we desire an improved
relationship'' with India.
</P>
<P>
   Given the Cold War coolness in U.S.-Indian relations, Clinton
administration officials have stressed that the president will
focus on improving ties to India, the subcontinent's giant, which
is expected to pass China and become the world's most populous
nation early in this century.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president will seek to begin a new chapter in our
relations with one of the world's leading countries and oldest
civilizations,'' Albright said. ``And I can think of few greater
gifts to the future than a strong and cooperative strategic
relationship between India and the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright pointed out that Clinton's five days in India will be
not only the first since the Carter administration but also the
most extensive visit ever to the region by a U.S. president.
</P>
<P>
   Albright made no secret of Clinton's interest in abetting
growing U.S.-Indian trade ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``In recent years, software exports have jumped 50 percent
annually with no end in sight,'' she said. ``American companies
from Apple and Texas Instruments to Oracle and Microsoft have come
to India for its high-tech and high skills. And while other
countries beat a path to India's door, it continues to enrich the
globe with talent.''

<P>
   ISRAEL: HOLDING ON TO VILLAGE
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak decided against transferring a West
Bank village abutting Jerusalem to Palestinian control after
rightists said the move would erode Israel's hold on the city and
endanger Jewish neighborhoods. Anata, where Palestinians already
run civil affairs, was to have come under full Palestinian control
as part of a planned handover of another 6.1 percent of the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   PALESTINIANS: ISRAELIS ON SYLLABUS
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian culture minister, Yasser Abed Rabbo, said he
would introduce Israeli authors into the Palestinian curriculum
after a storm in Israel over the addition of a Palestinian poet to
the high school syllabus. Yossi Sarid, Israel's education minister,
said he and Abed Rabbo were ``partners in the struggle against
people living in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL: MISSILE DEFENSE DEPLOYS
</P>
<P>
   Israel's Arrow 2 antiballistic missile defense system was

<P>
   Allow me to introduce the Installment Effect. That's my name for
what happens to investments when they're made or changed in
installments.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us live on the installment plan. We get paid in
installments, we spend in installments, we borrow and repay in
installments. We also invest in installments.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not how most calculations on investment return are
presented.
</P>
<P>
   All mutual-fund representations, for instance, assume that
investors make a single investment and never add a dime after that.
</P>
<P>
   The most familiar fund illustration _ the so-called mountain
chart _ routinely shows an initial molehill of an investment
growing to the size of Mount Kilimanjaro in a few decades.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who had the foresight to invest $10,000 in Fidelity
Magellan in 1975 and let that money grow would have had $2,757,950
by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain charts make an especially poor fit with 401(k) plans.
Even though 401(k) plans are based on regular periodic investments,
every piece of literature says that the return on a fund has been
X, Y, or Z over the last three-, five-, or ten-year period _ as
though the plan were funded by a single, onetime investment instead
of a multitude of monthly contributions.
</P>
<P>
   This is no statistical quibble. The return on a single
investment and the return on a series of additions to or
withdrawals from the same investment _ the Installment Effect _ are
quite different.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding the effect can mean the difference between a
well-financed old age and one that has you filling out a job
application at Wal-Mart at 84.
</P>
<P>
   A striking example of the Installment Effect can be found in an
unpublished paper with an innocent title, ``Retirement Withdrawal
Using a Calculator.'' It demonstrates just how far astray the
conventions of fixed-return calculation can lead us.
</P>
<P>
   Written by Jaye C. Jarrett, a San Antonio financial adviser with
a degree in mechanical engineering and a passion for crunching
numbers, the paper asks what would happen to a $1 million portfolio
composed of 65 percent large-company stocks and 35 percent fixed
income.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the portfolio withdraws $60,000 from it in the
first year. After that, the annual withdrawal is adjusted upward
for inflation. (To do the calculations quickly, Jarrett and a
computer programmer created a program to help grind out the
numbers. Called WATS, the program employs asset-return data from
Ibbotson Associates and allows the user to input any asset
allocation and see what would happen to it over any number of time
periods. Jarrett chose the 65/35 allocation because it was close to
that of many retirement plans.)
</P>
<P>
   Assuming an average portfolio return of 9.4 percent and an
average inflation rate of 3.75 percent, a conventional retirement
calculator _ like those found on many investment Web sites _ will
compound the investment by 9.4 percent each year, adjust the
withdrawal upward each year to account for average inflation, and
subtract the adjusted withdrawal from the return. Then it does the
same calculation for the next year and keeps on going until it
reaches the end of the time period.
</P>
<P>
   By that way of figuring, a retiree will take out $3,227,954 over
30 years _ $174,504 in the last year _ and will still have
$1,109,990 at the end of the period.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the result bears no relationship to what may
actually happen.
</P>
<P>
   Using his software to compute with actual rates of return and
actual rates of inflation, and doing it for every 30-year period
from 1926 to 1998, Jarrett got very different results.
</P>
<P>
   In 21 of the 44 periods, the retiree ran out of money.
</P>
<P>
   How the portfolio performed depended entirely on the year the
retiree left the work force, an event that isn't a choice for many
people.
</P>
<P>
   Someone who retired in 1949, for instance, would have more than
$4.4 million after 30 years. But anyone who retired in any year
after 1959 would have run out of money long before the period was
over.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to what most of us would expect, the worst periods to
retire weren't those that included the Great Depression. They were
the sizzling 1960s. The success rate for the 1960s was zero: In
each of the ten starting years, Jarrett's hypothetical retirees ran
out of money well before 30 years, crushed by erratic investment
returns and accelerating inflation. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 175 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 750) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, Peter Lynch suggested that a retiree could
safely withdraw 7 percent a year from an all-stock portfolio. It
seemed like a reasonable idea. After all, if the long-term return
on large-company stocks is more than 10 percent and the retiree
withdraws less, what can go wrong?
</P>
<P>
   Plenty.
</P>
<P>
   When you do the actual calculations over all the historical time
periods from 1926 to 1998, you learn that a constant withdrawal of
$70,000 from an initial portfolio of $1 million will exhaust the
portfolio in 9 of the 44 periods.
</P>
<P>
   This happens for the same reason that a man can drown in a river
with an average depth of one foot _ if he falls in one of the
places where the river is eight feet deep. Some years are good.
Some years are bad. Few are ``average.''
</P>
<P>
   Do the calculations year by year with actual returns and the
results are quite different from the average return for the
period. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Someone who retired in 1969 with $1 million and withdrew $70,000
a year to the end of 1998 would wind up with $13.9 million,
according to a conventional retirement calculator.
</P>
<P>
   The result seems logical enough, since the actual annualized
return on large-company stocks was 12.6 percent for the period.
</P>
<P>
   Actual experience, however, tells another story. Hit with both
the $70,000 withdrawal and an 8.5 percent loss in the first year,
the portfolio slips below $1 million and never recovers.
</P>
<P>
   With a value of $926,116 at the start of the 1973-74 crash, the
portfolio is down to $484,773 at the end of 1974 but is still
committed to providing $70,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   That's a withdrawal rate of more than 14 percent. From then on,
it sinks year after year despite the market's incredible rise since
1982. At the end of 1998, the account is overdrawn by $30,000. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 200 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,075) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To examine the difference, Jarrett had his software calculate a
new number, the ratio of the market-return result to the
average-return result. That was when he found some good news mixed
with the bad news.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett found that when regular withdrawals are made from a
portfolio, the portfolio's return tends to be lower than the
average annualized return for the same investment.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the portfolio will perform worse than the
average-return figure about 60 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it as the Spender's Penalty.
</P>
<P>
   When new investments are added to a portfolio, however, the
Installment Effect reverses. Instead of getting a lower return than
the historical annualized figure, there's a good chance of getting
a higher return.
</P>
<P>
   Investing by installments over long periods boosts the rate of
return above what a single, onetime investment would earn over the
same period.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the Accumulator's Bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose, for instance, that someone invested $2,000 a year from
1969 through 1998. If that money were invested in large stocks, the
Ibbotson figures show that it would earn an average annualized
return of 12.6 percent, accumulating to $544,521.
</P>
<P>
   The actual accumulation, however, would be $942,692 _ nearly
twice as much. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,375) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Using Jarrett's software and checking all 44 of the 30-year
periods, I found that actual experience beat average historical
performance 64 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   What does it all mean?
</P>
<P>
   Three things. First, most of the planning tools we use are
virtually useless.
</P>
<P>
   Second, we'll probably do better accumulating money than we
expect.
</P>
<P>
   And, third, we'll probably do worse in retirement, so spending
needs to be managed with great care. &QL;

COMMENTARY: GASOLINE TAX FOLLIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By PAUL KRUGMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Teachers of economics cherish bad policies. For
example, if New York ever ends rent control, we will lose a prime
example of what happens when you try to defy the law of supply and
demand. And so we should always be thankful when an important
politician makes a really bad policy proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Last week George W. Bush graciously obliged, by advocating a
reduction in gasoline taxes to offset the current spike in prices.
This proposal is a perfect illustration of why we need economic
analysis to figure out the true ``incidence'' of taxes: the people
who really pay for a tax increase, or benefit from a tax cut, are
often not those who literally fork over the cash. In this case,
cutting gasoline taxes would do little if anything to reduce the
price motorists pay at the pump. It would, however, provide a
windfall both to U.S. oil refiners and to the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with why the oil cartel should love this proposal.
Put yourself in the position of an OPEC minister: What sets the
limits to how high you want to push oil prices? The answer is that
you are afraid that too high a price will lead people to use less
gasoline, heating oil and so on, cutting into your exports.
Suppose, however, that you can count on the U.S. government to
reduce gasoline taxes whenever the price of crude oil rises. Then
Americans are less likely to reduce their oil consumption if you
conspire to drive prices up _ which makes such a conspiracy a
considerably more attractive proposition.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, in the short run _ and what we have right now is a
short-run gasoline shortage _ cutting gas taxes probably won't even
temporarily reduce prices at the pump. The quantity of oil
available for U.S. consumption over the near future is pretty much
a fixed number: the inventories on hand plus the supplies already
en route from the Middle East. Even if OPEC increases its output
next month, supplies are likely to be limited for a couple more
months. The rising price of gasoline to consumers is in effect the
market's way of rationing that limited supply of oil.
</P>
<P>
   Now suppose that we were to cut gasoline taxes. If the price of
gas at the pump were to fall, motorists would buy more gas. But
there isn't any more gas, so the price at the pump, inclusive of
the lowered tax, would quickly be bid right back up to the
pre-tax-cut level. And that means that any cut in taxes would show
up not in a lower price at the pump, but in a higher price paid to
distributors. In other words, the benefits of the tax cut would
flow not to consumers but to other parties, mainly the domestic oil
refining industry. (As the textbooks will tell you, reducing the
tax rate on an inelastically supplied good benefits the sellers,
not the buyers.)
</P>
<P>
   A cynic might suggest that that is the point. But I'd rather
think that Bush isn't deliberately trying to throw his friends in
the oil industry a few extra billions; I prefer to believe that the
candidate, or whichever adviser decided to make gasoline taxes an
issue, was playing a political rather than a financial game.
</P>
<P>
   There still remains the argument that the only good tax is a
dead tax. This leads us into the whole question of whether those
huge federal surplus projections are realistic (they aren't),
whether the budget is loaded with fat (it isn't), and so on. But
anyway, the gasoline tax is dedicated revenue, used for maintaining
and improving the nation's highways. This is one case in which a
tax cut would lead directly to cutbacks in a necessary and popular
government service.
</P>
<P>
   You could say that I am making too much of a mere political
gambit. Gasoline prices have increased more than 50 cents a gallon
over the past year; Bush only proposes rolling back 1993's 4.3-cent
tax increase.
</P>
<P>
   But the gas tax proposal is nonetheless revealing. Bush numbers
some of the world's leading experts on tax incidence among his
advisers. I cannot believe that they think cutting gasoline taxes
is a good economic policy in the face of an OPEC power play. So
this suggests a certain degree of cynical political opportunism.
(I'm shocked, shocked!) And it also illustrates the candidate's
attachment to a sort of knee-jerk conservatism, according to which
tax cuts are the answer to every problem.
</P>
<P>
   As a citizen, then, I deplore this proposal. As a college
lecturer, however, I am delighted.

</P>
<P>
   Using his software to compute with actual rates of return and
actual rates of inflation, and doing it for every 30-year period
from 1926 to 1998, Jarrett got very different results.
</P>
<P>
   In 21 of the 44 periods, the retiree ran out of money.
</P>
<P>
   How the portfolio performed depended entirely on the year the
retiree left the work force, an event that isn't a choice for many
people.
</P>
<P>
   Someone who retired in 1949, for instance, would have more than
$4.4 million after 30 years. But anyone who retired in any year
after 1959 would have run out of money long before the period was
over.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to what most of us would expect, the worst periods to
retire weren't those that included the Great Depression. They were
the sizzling 1960s. The success rate for the 1960s was zero: In
each of the ten starting years, Jarrett's hypothetical retirees ran
out of money well before 30 years, crushed by erratic investment
returns and accelerating inflation. &QL;

   Several years ago, Peter Lynch suggested that a retiree could
safely withdraw 7 percent a year from an all-stock portfolio. It
seemed like a reasonable idea. After all, if the long-term return
on large-company stocks is more than 10 percent and the retiree
withdraws less, what can go wrong?
</P>
<P>
   Plenty.
</P>
<P>
   When you do the actual calculations over all the historical time
periods from 1926 to 1998, you learn that a constant withdrawal of
$70,000 from an initial portfolio of $1 million will exhaust the
portfolio in 9 of the 44 periods.
</P>
<P>
   This happens for the same reason that a man can drown in a river
with an average depth of one foot _ if he falls in one of the
places where the river is eight feet deep. Some years are good.
Some years are bad. Few are ``average.''
</P>
<P>
   Do the calculations year by year with actual returns and the
results are quite different from the average return for the
period. &QL;

   Someone who retired in 1969 with $1 million and withdrew $70,000
a year to the end of 1998 would wind up with $13.9 million,
according to a conventional retirement calculator.
</P>
<P>
   The result seems logical enough, since the actual annualized
return on large-company stocks was 12.6 percent for the period.
</P>
<P>
   Actual experience, however, tells another story. Hit with both
the $70,000 withdrawal and an 8.5 percent loss in the first year,
the portfolio slips below $1 million and never recovers.
</P>
<P>
   With a value of $926,116 at the start of the 1973-74 crash, the
portfolio is down to $484,773 at the end of 1974 but is still
committed to providing $70,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   That's a withdrawal rate of more than 14 percent. From then on,
it sinks year after year despite the market's incredible rise since
1982. At the end of 1998, the account is overdrawn by $30,000. &QL;

   To examine the difference, Jarrett had his software calculate a
new number, the ratio of the market-return result to the
average-return result. That was when he found some good news mixed
with the bad news.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett found that when regular withdrawals are made from a
portfolio, the portfolio's return tends to be lower than the
average annualized return for the same investment.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the portfolio will perform worse than the
average-return figure about 60 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it as the Spender's Penalty.
</P>
<P>
   When new investments are added to a portfolio, however, the
Installment Effect reverses. Instead of getting a lower return than
the historical annualized figure, there's a good chance of getting
a higher return.
</P>
<P>
   Investing by installments over long periods boosts the rate of
return above what a single, onetime investment would earn over the
same period.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the Accumulator's Bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose, for instance, that someone invested $2,000 a year from
1969 through 1998. If that money were invested in large stocks, the
Ibbotson figures show that it would earn an average annualized
return of 12.6 percent, accumulating to $544,521.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Allow me to introduce the Installment Effect. That's my name for
what happens to investments when they're made or changed in
installments.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us live on the installment plan. We get paid in
installments, we spend in installments, we borrow and repay in
installments. We also invest in installments.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not how most calculations on investment return are
presented.
</P>
<P>
   All mutual-fund representations, for instance, assume that
investors make a single investment and never add a dime after that.
</P>
<P>
   The most familiar fund illustration _ the so-called mountain
chart _ routinely shows an initial molehill of an investment
growing to the size of Mount Kilimanjaro in a few decades.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who had the foresight to invest $10,000 in Fidelity
Magellan in 1975 and let that money grow would have had $2,757,950
by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain charts make an especially poor fit with 401(k) plans.
Even though 401(k) plans are based on regular periodic investments,
every piece of literature says that the return on a fund has been
X, Y, or Z over the last three-, five-, or ten-year period _ as
though the plan were funded by a single, onetime investment instead
of a multitude of monthly contributions.
</P>
<P>
   This is no statistical quibble. The return on a single
investment and the return on a series of additions to or
withdrawals from the same investment _ the Installment Effect _ are
quite different.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding the effect can mean the difference between a
well-financed old age and one that has you filling out a job
application at Wal-Mart at 84.
</P>
<P>
   A striking example of the Installment Effect can be found in an
unpublished paper with an innocent title, ``Retirement Withdrawal
Using a Calculator.'' It demonstrates just how far astray the
conventions of fixed-return calculation can lead us.
</P>
<P>
   Written by Jaye C. Jarrett, a San Antonio financial adviser with
a degree in mechanical engineering and a passion for crunching
numbers, the paper asks what would happen to a $1 million portfolio
composed of 65 percent large-company stocks and 35 percent fixed
income.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the portfolio withdraws $60,000 from it in the
first year. After that, the annual withdrawal is adjusted upward
for inflation. (To do the calculations quickly, Jarrett and a
computer programmer created a program to help grind out the
numbers. Called WATS, the program employs asset-return data from
Ibbotson Associates and allows the user to input any asset
allocation and see what would happen to it over any number of time
periods. Jarrett chose the 65/35 allocation because it was close to
that of many retirement plans.)
</P>
<P>
   Assuming an average portfolio return of 9.4 percent and an
average inflation rate of 3.75 percent, a conventional retirement
calculator _ like those found on many investment Web sites _ will
compound the investment by 9.4 percent each year, adjust the
withdrawal upward each year to account for average inflation, and
subtract the adjusted withdrawal from the return. Then it does the
same calculation for the next year and keeps on going until it
reaches the end of the time period.
</P>
<P>
   By that way of figuring, a retiree will take out $3,227,954 over
30 years _ $174,504 in the last year _ and will still have
$1,109,990 at the end of the period.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the result bears no relationship to what may
actually happen.
</P>
<P>
   Using his software to compute with actual rates of return and
actual rates of inflation, and doing it for every 30-year period
from 1926 to 1998, Jarrett got very different results.
</P>
<P>
   In 21 of the 44 periods, the retiree ran out of money.
</P>
<P>
   How the portfolio performed depended entirely on the year the
retiree left the work force, an event that isn't a choice for many
people.
</P>
<P>
   Someone who retired in 1949, for instance, would have more than
$4.4 million after 30 years. But anyone who retired in any year
after 1959 would have run out of money long before the period was
over.

   It's often said that the Internet opens up new frontiers for the
exercise of human ingenuity. Case in point: the simple, elegantly
practicable scheme that Internet entrepreneur Derick Bulkley has
dreamed up to send the revenue of GoTo.com into orbit.
</P>
<P>
   In case you haven't heard of it, GoTo.com is an Internet search
engine with a gimmick whose crass commercialism has a terrifying
purity about it. The search engine lists Web sites strictly in
order of what they're willing to pay GoTo for click-through
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   For example, on a recent day, the highest-bidding (and thus
top-listed) blackjack site was willing to pay GoTo $7.91 every time
someone clicked through to the gambling site from GoTo.com. The
highest-bidding insurance site was paying GoTo $7.13 every time the
search engine sent an Internet surfer the insurer's way.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes one of those twists that seems blindingly obvious once
it's pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   Derick Bulkley, CEO of SeriousCollector.com, a Web site for,
yes, serious collectors (of coins, stamps, and much more), has
figured out how much revenue GoTo would rake in if, once a day,
every GoTo shareholder clicked through to the search engine's ten
highest-bidding sites.
</P>
<P>
   Bulkley has no stake in GoTo, but cheerfully admits, ``I do
weird analysis for fun.''
</P>
<P>
   He has put together a spreadsheet showing that on a recent day a
GoTo shareholder clicking through once to each of the top ten sites
could generate $75.38 in additional revenue for the company.
</P>
<P>
   If 100 shareholders took part in the scheme every day for a full
quarter, GoTo would reap $700,000 in additional revenue.
Participation by 1,000 GoTo shareholders for a full quarter would
produce an extra $6.77 million _ about 52 percent of GoTo's
estimated first-quarter revenue of $13.04 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ever the imaginative capitalist, Bulkley has even devised an
advanced version of the GoTo game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say you hire a worker at $10 per hour to click all day
long by constantly reconnecting with AOL (to change the incoming
address),'' Bulkley says. ``If that worker can execute one click
every two minutes at an average price of $6 per click, then that
worker would generate $93,600 in revenue for GoTo every quarter, at
a cost of $5,200. Thus, one could spend $52,000 to increase GoTo's
quarterly revenue by $936,000 or spend $520,000 on ten workers to
increase GoTo's income by $9.36 million for the quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   And just to complete this exercise in creative greed, Bulkley
has one last, blithely cold-blooded suggestion: ``Relocation of
your labor force to another country would significantly reduce
cost.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, there's no sign that anyone has put Bulkley's scam into
operation. But just in case GoTo reports a sudden surge in revenue,
you'll know whom to thank. &QL;

someone clicked through to the gambling site from GoTo.com. The
highest-bidding insurance site was paying GoTo $7.13 every time the
search engine sent an Internet surfer the insurer's way.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes one of those twists that seems blindingly obvious once
it's pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   Derick Bulkley, CEO of SeriousCollector.com, a Web site for,
yes, serious collectors (of coins, stamps, and much more), has
figured out how much revenue GoTo would rake in if, once a day,
every GoTo shareholder clicked through to the search engine's ten
highest-bidding sites.
</P>
<P>
   Bulkley has no stake in GoTo, but cheerfully admits, ``I do
weird analysis for fun.''
</P>
<P>
   He has put together a spreadsheet showing that on a recent day a
GoTo shareholder clicking through once to each of the top ten sites
could generate $75.38 in additional revenue for the company.
</P>
<P>
   If 100 shareholders took part in the scheme every day for a full
quarter, GoTo would reap $700,000 in additional revenue.
Participation by 1,000 GoTo shareholders for a full quarter would
produce an extra $6.77 million _ about 52 percent of GoTo's
estimated first-quarter revenue of $13.04 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ever the imaginative capitalist, Bulkley has even devised an
advanced version of the GoTo game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say you hire a worker at $10 per hour to click all day
long by constantly reconnecting with AOL (to change the incoming
address),'' Bulkley says. ``If that worker can execute one click
every two minutes at an average price of $6 per click, then that
worker would generate $93,600 in revenue for GoTo every quarter, at
a cost of $5,200. Thus, one could spend $52,000 to increase GoTo's
quarterly revenue by $936,000 or spend $520,000 on ten workers to
increase GoTo's income by $9.36 million for the quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   And just to complete this exercise in creative greed, Bulkley
has one last, blithely cold-blooded suggestion: ``Relocation of
your labor force to another country would significantly reduce
cost.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, there's no sign that anyone has put Bulkley's scam into
operation. But just in case GoTo reports a sudden surge in revenue,
you'll know whom to thank. &QL;

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ It was about noon on a Wednesday, and the
retired Silicon Valley executive in a black V-neck sweater was
considering a much more relaxed range of choices than he was
accustomed to: Should he start with a merlot? Or perhaps a cabernet
sauvignon? And should it be a recent vintage or an older, riskier
one?
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he dived in, nose first, and after a long sniff took
a generous sip of the 1988 merlot. Pronouncing it acceptable, he
moved on to the 1990, 1991 and 1994 versions. Then came the
cabernets and finally a single chardonnay to wrap up the tasting.
</P>
<P>
   After each tilt of a glass, however, came a clue that this was
not a typical northern California retiree. The man swished the wine
around in his mouth and then spit it into a red plastic cup. It was
still before lunch, after all, and the man, Lewis E. Platt, had
hours more work in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   Platt, it turns out, is retired only from Silicon Valley, not
from the business world. In one of the more unusual corporate job
changes in years, Platt, 58, left Hewlett-Packard last year after
33 years, including an up-and-down seven-year term as chief
executive, and promptly took the top job at Kendall-Jackson Wine
Estates.
</P>
<P>
   It was quite a transition. Since December, he has moved from
Palo Alto and a global company with 124,000 employees at the center
of the new economy, to Wine Country and a private firm with 1,200
workers in one of the world's oldest industries.
</P>
<P>
   When Platt accepted the Kendall-Jackson job late last year
rather than take the more common path of sitting on corporate
boards, teaching business school classes or leading a foundation,
he generated a buzz among executives around the country. Gerard R.
Roche, the headhunter who selected him, said he had since received
calls from at least six ``big-name CEO's'' asking for help in
finding similar posts when they retire.
</P>
<P>
   One executive said, ``Get me something like that. What a way to
go out,'' according to Roche, the chairman of the search firm
Heidrick &AMP; Struggles.
</P>
<P>
   Platt's new job certainly seems romantic. A wine enthusiast with
a 2,500-bottle cellar at home, he works in Kendall-Jackson's
headquarters here, about 60 miles north of San Francisco, with a
first-floor corner office that looks out on a vineyard and the
mountains that separate Napa and Sonoma counties. He has come to
the industry in good times, when the long economic expansion has
inspired many Americans to drink more expensive wine.
Kendall-Jackson has been one of the main beneficiaries, becoming
perhaps the biggest California success story of the last decade on
the strength of its $10 chardonnay.
</P>
<P>
   But Platt's switch has also brought a management problem the
textbooks do not discuss: How does an executive who has already
climbed to the top _ and grown used to the trappings that come with
one of corporate America's plum jobs _ start anew? The question is
particularly relevant because both the average age and the average
tenure of chief executives at large companies are dropping. As the
calls to Roche indicate, even those chiefs with sterling resumes
and lots of energy will be pondering what to do in the coming
years.
</P>
<P>
   Platt's answer has been to sublimate his ego, forget about the
trappings and pretend that he is 20 years younger, running a
division of Hewlett-Packard. He has thrown himself into the number
crunching and small decisions that he once relegated to underlings.
``I'm actually back doing things,'' the burly, mild-mannered Platt
said with satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   In his previous life, he made millions, dined with President
Clinton and swapped ideas with foreign leaders at the World
Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Now, Platt says, he wants to
turn his attention to one of his passions and get the satisfaction
that comes from having direct responsibility for products.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, he had plenty of reasons to take up fishing, one of
his hobbies, after leaving Hewlett-Packard. Though the company
flourished under him at first, profits slumped in his final years.
Some employees and investors blamed his relaxed style, contrasting
him with more aggressive corporate leaders who have remade
hidebound companies. His successor, Carleton S. Fiorina, has even
become the star of Hewlett-Packard's current advertising campaign,
saying, ``The original start-up will act like one again.''
</P>
<P>
   At Kendall-Jackson, Platt has taken over a company with a
firebrand of its own. Jess Jackson, a San Francisco trial attorney
who founded the winery, and his former wife, Jane, were the only
people ever to have run it, and he remains its chairman. ``Jess
Jackson took KJ from a small, second-tier producer and placed it
squarely among the top 10 premium producers in California,'' said
David I. Freed, the chairman of Silverado Premium Properties, a
firm in Napa, Calif., that sells grapes to wineries. (Kendall is a
family name of Jackson's former wife, who is no longer in
management.)
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has the strong entrepreneurial personality and will not
have an easy time relinquishing control, say people who have worked
with him. Platt, in other words, went from the undisputed head of a
$50 billion company to one of two bosses at a $400 million concern.

   It's often said that the Internet opens up new frontiers for the
exercise of human ingenuity. Case in point: the simple, elegantly
practicable scheme that Internet entrepreneur Derick Bulkley has
dreamed up to send the revenue of GoTo.com into orbit.
</P>
<P>
   In case you haven't heard of it, GoTo.com is an Internet search
engine with a gimmick whose crass commercialism has a terrifying
purity about it. The search engine lists Web sites strictly in
order of what they're willing to pay GoTo for click-through
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   For example, on a recent day, the highest-bidding (and thus
top-listed) blackjack site was willing to pay GoTo $7.91 every time
someone clicked through to the gambling site from GoTo.com. The
highest-bidding insurance site was paying GoTo $7.13 every time the
search engine sent an Internet surfer the insurer's way.

SANTA ROSA: million concern.
<TEXT>
<P>
   All of which has led some industry analysts to speculate that
Platt is mostly window-dressing to help Kendall-Jackson go public,
a move that it has been considering for two years. Even some of his
friends think his venture into the wine business is something of a
lark, Platt says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had more trouble convincing my friends this is work _
they think I sit around and do tastings all day long,'' he said.
Not so, he said: ``This is a real job.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his first tasks has been to tinker with parts of his
management style to fit his new job. Although Hewlett-Packard is a
relatively flat organization where all executives work out of
cubicles, Platt still relied on dozens of analysts to comb through
information for him. Though he is known for his mild manners, he
once stood up in front of a crowd of managers, told them they were
falling down on the job, asked them for new ideas and then blasted
those new ideas the next day.
</P>
<P>
   At Kendall-Jackson, by contrast, he has stepped gingerly. He has
told his new employees that he does not consider himself a wine
industry expert simply because he is a collector. On a tour of
Kendall-Jackson's storage rooms and bottling plant, for example, he
met some employees for the first time and spoke to them as if he
were a tourist visiting the winery, asking them about everything
from the speed of a conveyer belt to the level of tannic acid in a
wine. During the tasting of merlots and cabernets, he proclaimed
his judgment of various vintages, but then turned to
Kendall-Jackson's winemaster to see how close to the truth he was.
</P>
<P>
   Only when Platt stepped into a laboratory and noticed a
Hewlett-Packard chemicals machine did he try to show off some of
his own knowledge. ``I actually managed Hewlett-Packard's chemicals
business for many years,'' he said, smiling, to the workers in the
room.
</P>
<P>
   He has brought a similar care to his relationship with Jackson.
The two speak frequently, and Platt says he has been mindful of not
grabbing the reins too quickly. ``There are always some issues when
the owner or founder is still involved,'' said Platt, who was
Hewlett-Packard's chief when David Packard was still chairman.
``You can't just storm in and take over.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said, ``Lew has a selflessness about his leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   He also has the kind of corporate experience that almost every
other professional oenophile lacks, and in a few ways he is trying
to reshape Kendall-Jackson instead of himself. His laid-back
approach, he hopes, will allow him to bring discipline to an
enterprise that has sprouted some bureaucracy as it has grown.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived in January, Platt found an approval process for
travel and other expenditures that often required five signatures
for a single trip. Kendall-Jackson also had little in the way of a
formal bonus plan, and employees say they received extra money
largely at the whim of their bosses.
</P>
<P>
   Now, all employees know their bonus depends on some combination
of their year-end review, their department's performance and the
company's profits. And managers receive a budget and can spend
money on travel as they see fit. ``As you start to give people a
little more freedom,'' Platt said, ``you can actually transfer a
lot of responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   (One byproduct of bureaucracy that Platt will not eliminate is
the door to his office. This is the first time he has ever had one,
he said.)
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Platt says he has been enjoying taking more
direct responsibility for the nuts-and-bolts decisions of running a
company. He is studying Kendall-Jackson's vineyards to determine
those that can be replanted to produce red wine, which became much
more popular in the 1990's as some doctors credited moderate
drinking of it with lowering the risk of heart disease. More than
70 percent of Kendall-Jackson's wine is now chardonnay.
</P>
<P>
   Another priority is to sell more Kendall-Jackson wine overseas.
Now, just 3 percent of its output leaves the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, his current education resembles his intense
introduction to wine in the 1980's. Shortly after moving to
California for Hewlett-Packard, he immersed himself in the subject,
buying books, attending tastings and pumping for information from
his boss at the time, who was Hewlett-Packard's chief operating
officer and a wine aficionado.
</P>
<P>
   It was all a reaction to the first dinner parties he gave in his
new state and the wine he served. ``People made fun of me,'' he
remembers, ``and I didn't like that.''

SPORTS COLUMN: THE ICE GETS THINNER FOR SMITH 
</HEADLINE>
  (hm) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the trade deadline, the Rangers did what they have been doing
all season: nothing. The Devils did what they needed to do:
something.
</P>
<P>
   With only 11 games remaining in their National Hockey League
schedule, the Rangers seem doomed to miss the Stanley Cup playoffs
for the third straight year. But they didn't, or couldn't, make a
deal to improve their chances.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils, meanwhile, acquired what they lacked the last two
years in being upset in the first round of the playoffs: a
goal-scoring sniper, Alexander Mogilny.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the Rangers, with their tedious 28-33-10 record,
were somehow to scramble into the playoffs, it would merely
represent a pacifier, not a panacea.
</P>
<P>
   If the Rangers were a stock on Wall Street, their $61 million
payroll would prompt an investigation for fraud, considering the
exorbitant prices of Garden tickets.
</P>
<P>
   For $61 million, the Garden's corporate honchos surely expected
a return to the playoffs along with the promise of a developing
Stanley Cup contender. Instead, the honchos got a team that is
under .500 and, as presently constituted, is not a guarantee to be
much better in the future.
</P>
<P>
   All this has put Neil Smith, the general manager responsible for
assembling this sorry squad, on thinner ice than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, that ice was as solid as the memory of the 1994
Stanley Cup champions that Smith put together, acquiring Mark
Messier and swinging the trade-deadline deals that bolstered the
Rangers' run to the cup. And for all the contract commotion around
Messier's departure three years later, Smith deserved the
opportunity to rebuild the Rangers into a cup contender.
</P>
<P>
   With that 1994 Stanley Cup on his resume, Smith also deserved
the benefit of the doubt on hockey decisions from his boss, Dave
Checketts, the Garden president.
</P>
<P>
   Checketts, after all, is basically a basketball guy, not a
hockey guy. He operated the Utah Jazz before taking over the Knicks
and then moving upstairs as the Garden president. Quite naturally,
and quite understandably, he deferred to Smith's judgment on hockey
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Smith signed Wayne Gretzky, but after the Great One's one season
with Messier ended in the 1997 conference final, Messier was gone
to Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   When the Rangers slumped, Smith changed coaches, firing Colin
Campbell and hiring John Muckler, but that hasn't made a
difference.
</P>
<P>
   After missing the playoffs again last year, Smith signed Theo
Fleury, who was expected to score anywhere from 35 to 40 goals. He
has scored 14.
</P>
<P>
   With the Rangers on a treadmill for the third straight year,
Smith's judgment is now more than suspect; it's expendable. If the
Rangers were somehow to salvage a playoff berth, he might survive.
But if they miss the playoffs with their $61 million payroll, his
ice should melt.
</P>
<P>
   And Smith seems to know it.
</P>
<P>
   After the Rangers wasted a 3-1 lead in Monday night's eventual
4-3 loss to the cup champion Dallas Stars at the Garden, Smith
quietly wandered into the dressing area of the locker room with its
soft chairs, soft drinks, a bowl of fruit and a coffee dispenser.
</P>
<P>
   With his head down, the general manager apparently did not want
to make eye contact with any reporters who might ask a question. He
made himself a cup of coffee and departed without a word about the
team that had lost another game it should have won.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to win all the close games,'' said Brian Leetch, the
Ranger captain. ``We haven't been able to win, 3-2 or 2-1. We've
left a lot of points out there. All the top teams seem to be able
to win those close games.''
</P>
<P>
   In seven of their 11 remaining games, the Rangers will be
playing such top teams as Dallas, Detroit, Philadelphia and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But after the trade deadline passed Tuesday without a Ranger
deal, Smith stubbornly insisted that ``this team has the quality to
be well into the playoffs,'' although he wouldn't explain why this
team with so much ``quality'' has won only five games since the
All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't answer that off the cuff,'' he said. Later he said:
``These players have a responsibility. They've been treated well
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Treated by Neil Smith to a total of $61 million in salaries that
too many of them haven't earned in another sad season for the
Rangers.

CLINTON AND GORE SYNCHRONIZE MESSAGES ON GUN CONTROL AND MORE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MARC LACEY 
  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton squeezed the issue into a recent
speech on China's entry into the World Trade Organization. He
inserted a few lines on the matter while discussing the need for
vaccines in Africa. He added it to his call for prescription drug
benefits for seniors.
</P>
<P>
   Since one first-grader killed another two weeks ago in Michigan,
Clinton has pressed the need for tougher gun laws from the
presidential lectern in a nonstop barrage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went and met with the families that lost their children at
Columbine, out in Springfield, Oregon, and Jonesboro, Arkansas. I
didn't like that,'' Clinton said at a Monday evening fund-raiser in
Chicago. ``I've met with a lot of people who died from violence or
whose loved ones died from violence. I'm just trying to keep more
people alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Out on the campaign trail, Vice President Al Gore has been just
as pointed in urging congressional Republicans to back tougher gun
laws. ``If there are shootings in the first-grade and still they
are not willing to support child trigger locks, what will it
take?'' he asked last week at a rally in Buffalo. ``Shootings in
kindergarten? Shootings in nursery school?''
</P>
<P>
   Expect to hear Clinton and Gore echoing each other more and more
between now and Election Day, whether the subject is gun
legislation, prescription drug benefits or the threat to the
economy of excessive tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and the Gore campaign are in daily contact to
coordinate their messages, and advisers to Clinton and Gore have
come to see benefits to their respective bosses, and to Democratic
candidates in general, in speaking from the same page.

   Since the shooting at Theo J. Buell Elementary School in Mount
Morris Township, Mich., Clinton has bashed the National Rifle
Association every chance he gets. He laments the tragedy of another
child slain. He urges Congress to get on with legislation. Ditto
for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the president goes out and talks about guns, he's
essentially saying A, you need a Democratic president and B, you
need to change the Congress,'' said Mark Penn, a Democratic
pollster.
</P>
<P>
   Penn said that gun control opponents traditionally have been a
small but extremely motivated voting bloc. But in this election,
because of the recent shootings, Penn said that ``suburban women
voters have come to feel the same intensity'' in favor of gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   The president's stepped-up advocacy of gun control illustrates a
White House strategy that is aimed both at moving whatever
legislation he can get through in the remaining months of his
presidency and ensuring that his agenda continues under Gore's
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Although the gun legislation is stalled because of a dispute
over checks at gun shows, aides to Clinton believe the president's
barrage could force a compromise. But even if the status quo
remains, Gore and other Democrats on the ticket will enter the fall
with a prime election issue in their pockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``A president's power comes from the ability to frame the debate
and President Clinton is very good at that,'' said Al From,
president of the Democratic Leadership Council. ``He'd like to have
this as one of his final year legislative achievements. But if he
can't have it, he can help frame the debate to help his party.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Clinton seized on gun control as the issue du jour at a
fund-raiser in West Palm Beach, Fla., hours after news of the
school shooting in Michigan broke on Feb. 29. He has continued with
a fury ever since in appearances in Miami; Ashburn, Va.; San Jose,
Calif.; San Francisco; Cleveland and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Capitalizing on the public attention surrounding the incident,
Clinton called lawmakers to the White House to urge them to break
the legislative logjam. Hours later, he was meeting with the mother
of the young Michigan girl who was killed.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's advisers vehemently dispute the notion that they want
the impasse between Congress and the White House to continue on gun
control or any other issue.
</P>
<P>
   And they reacted furiously to the suggestion by Wayne LaPierre,
vice president of the National Rifle Association, that the
president is politicking instead of working to resolve the issue
and is ``willing to accept a certain level of killing to further
his political agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Reed, the White House domestic policy adviser, said the
president would much prefer to sign gun legislation than argue
about it through the election. But Clinton has made clear that he
is willing to do the latter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president and Gov. Bush have dramatically different
positions on the whole issue of guns and I think it ought to be a
big issue in the presidential election,'' Clinton said in an
interview Sunday on ABC's ``This Week.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, he also has raised the issue of guns in
interviews on the ``CBS Evening News,'' NBC's ``Today Show,'' and
CNN's ``Burden of Proof.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Gore began their joint crusade on the gun issue long
before Kayla Renee Rolland was shot by a first-grade classmate.
</P>
<P>
   At the president's State of the Union address, Clinton endorsed
Gore's plan to require photo licenses for new gun buyers instead of
former Sen. Bill Bradley's more ambitious proposal to register
every handgun. He endorsed Gore's plan knowing it stood no chance
of being enacted during his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a president who truly wants his vice president to
succeed him, probably more than any other president before him,''
said Stephen Hess, an expert on the presidency at the Brookings
Institution in Washington. ``He sees that as part of his legacy,
particularly because his legacy is a little shaky. What you're
seeing on gun control, you're going to see with virtually every
other issue.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has taken a stance supported by the NRA, is prepared
for the president's intervention on the issue, according to aides.
Bush advisers said Clinton's high-voltage rhetoric represents a
marked contrast from how Bush would handle the gun control issue _
through compromise aimed at getting results.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the president's priorities in his second term is to
give Al Gore what would amount to a third term,'' said Bush
spokesman Ari Fleischer. ``We expect that. We're ready for that.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Retirement savers have enjoyed a pretty good run lately _
probably even better than they think. Or so I concluded after
studying the performance of 24 leading mutual funds used in 401(k)
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Most investors collected a nice ``installment bonus'' on their
401(k)-plan investments. Not because they invested brilliantly but
because they invested methodically, making regular tax-deductible
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of an installment bonus comes from San Antonio
investment adviser Jaye C. Jarrett and WAT$, his software for
studying stock-market returns. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (EDITORS: TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE BONUS THAT COMES FROM
INVESTING ON THE INSTALLMENT PLAN, SEE SCOTT BURNS'S ARTICLE, ``THE
MOLEHILL-TO-MOUNTAIN MYTH OF RETIREMENT SAVINGS,'' FROM THE
FEBRUARY ``WORTH'' MAGAZINE, VIA THE NEW YORK TIMES SPECIAL
FEATURES. STORY IS SLUGGED
BC-BADNEWS-BOOMER-MATH-750&AMP;add-WORTH-NYTSF.) &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While trying to develop spending rules for the portfolios of
retirees and charitable institutions, Jarrett discovered that if
you are making regular withdrawals from a portfolio, your actual
return will trail the advertised rate of return about 60 percent of
the time.
</P>
<P>
   But if you are making regular additions, your return will exceed
the advertised rate about 60 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   The reason this happens is simple. While most investment returns
are calculated on the basis of a single, onetime investment, most
people build their 401(k) portfolios by making a lot of small
investments over a long period of time.
</P>
<P>
   Over a ten-year stretch, they don't invest once; they invest 120
times _ once a month _ in the same assets.
</P>
<P>
   Since investment performance varies from month to month, they
are, in effect, dollar-cost averaging: buying more shares when
prices are down and fewer when prices are down and fewer when
prices are up.
</P>
<P>
   In retirement, the whole process runs in reverse: They sell more
shares when prices are down and fewer when they are up. The net
effect is that retirement savers tend to earn a
higher-than-expected return when building up their accounts and
lower-than-expected return when drawing them down.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose you had committed to investing $100 a month in Vanguard
Index 500 starting Dec. 1, 1989. Over the next ten years you would
have invested $12,000 and accumulated $31,848, assuming you earned
the annual total return of 17.37 percent that Vanguard reported for
the ten years ended Nov. 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Your account statement, however, would show a different number:
$35,901. That's a bonus of $4,053 _ an amount equal to 40 months of
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Similar installment bonuses were produced by 19 of 24 funds
popular among 401(k) investors. Each fund's installment bonus (or
penalty) was calculated using Jaye Jarrett's WAT$ software.
</P>
<P>
   The results point up some dramatic performance gaps. At $39.895,
second-ranked American Century Ultra is about $4,000 _ 40 monthly
contributions _ ahead of Vanguard Index 500 and more than $10,000
ahead of Fidelity Equity-Income.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard Primecap, the top-performing fund on the list of
$43,476, topped American Century Select by 124 monthly installments
_ quite a feat, considering that the period being measured was only
120 months long.
</P>
<P>
   There was little correlation between a fund's advertised return
and its installment bonus. And in the case of Fidelity Contrafund,
an installment penalty seemed to be the price of a constantly
escalating net asset value.
</P>
<P>
   There are other surprises hidden in the numbers. Look at where
Vanguard Index 500, which mirrors the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Stock
Index, ranks on the list _ 9th out of 22 equity funds (Fidelity
Puritan and Dodge &AMP; Cox Balanced are balanced funds.)
</P>
<P>
   This means that 36 percent of the leading 401(k) funds beat the
market.
</P>
<P>
   During the same ten-year period _ one that marked the rise of
index investing _ only 16.4 percent of all domestic equity funds
could make that claim.
</P>
<P>
   In this connection, it's worth pointing out that the average
domestic equity fund now has an expense ratio of 1.43 percent a
year, but not one of the funds on this list has an expense ratio
over 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To see if there's a way to use this information to select funds,
I conducted a simple exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Since Fidelity is by far the dominant mutual-fund company in the
401(k) world, I figured that for many 401(k) investors picking an
investment boils down to choosing among managed Fidelity funds such
as Magellan, Growth &AMP; Income, Contrafund, and Equity-Income, or
buying an index fund.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at each of five ten-year periods between 1986 and 1999,
I used the WAT$ software to learn which of those funds provided the
largest ten-year accumulation with the greatest consistency.
</P>
<P>
   Not Equity-Income. It finished last for the ten-year periods
ending in 1999, 1998, 1997, 1996, and 1995. It wasn't Magellan,
either. For all the fuss over its performance this year, it never
came in better than third.
</P>
<P>
   The index fund? Nope. It came in third or fourth most of the
time _ but it beat Magellan in three of the five most recent
periods. The respected Growth &AMP; Income fund was fairly consistent
second.
</P>
<P>
   The winner for all five ten-year periods was Contrafund, giving
401(k) investors one more piece of good news.
</P>
<P>
   Contrafund has been closed to new retail investors since April
1998 but remains open to new money from 401(k)-plan participants. &QL;

studying the performance of 24 leading mutual funds used in 401(k)
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Most investors collected a nice ``installment bonus'' on their
401(k)-plan investments. Not because they invested brilliantly but
because they invested methodically, making regular tax-deductible
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of an installment bonus comes from San Antonio
investment adviser Jaye C. Jarrett and WAT$, his software for
studying stock-market returns. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (EDITORS: TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE BONUS THAT COMES FROM
INVESTING ON THE INSTALLMENT PLAN, SEE SCOTT BURNS'S ARTICLE, ``THE
MOLEHILL-TO-MOUNTAIN MYTH OF RETIREMENT SAVINGS,'' FROM THE
FEBRUARY ``WORTH'' MAGAZINE, VIA THE NEW YORK TIMES SPECIAL
FEATURES. STORY IS SLUGGED
BC-BADNEWS-BOOMER-MATH-750&AMP;add-WORTH-NYTSF.) &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While trying to develop spending rules for the portfolios of
retirees and charitable institutions, Jarrett discovered that if
you are making regular withdrawals from a portfolio, your actual
return will trail the advertised rate of return about 60 percent of
the time.
</P>
<P>
   But if you are making regular additions, your return will exceed
the advertised rate about 60 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   The reason this happens is simple. While most investment returns
are calculated on the basis of a single, onetime investment, most
people build their 401(k) portfolios by making a lot of small
investments over a long period of time.
</P>
<P>
   Over a ten-year stretch, they don't invest once; they invest 120
times _ once a month _ in the same assets.
</P>
<P>
   Since investment performance varies from month to month, they
are, in effect, dollar-cost averaging: buying more shares when
prices are down and fewer when prices are down and fewer when
prices are up.
</P>
<P>
   In retirement, the whole process runs in reverse: They sell more
shares when prices are down and fewer when they are up. The net
effect is that retirement savers tend to earn a
higher-than-expected return when building up their accounts and
lower-than-expected return when drawing them down.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose you had committed to investing $100 a month in Vanguard
Index 500 starting Dec. 1, 1989. Over the next ten years you would
have invested $12,000 and accumulated $31,848, assuming you earned
the annual total return of 17.37 percent that Vanguard reported for
the ten years ended Nov. 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Your account statement, however, would show a different number:
$35,901. That's a bonus of $4,053 _ an amount equal to 40 months of
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Similar installment bonuses were produced by 19 of 24 funds
popular among 401(k) investors. Each fund's installment bonus (or
penalty) was calculated using Jaye Jarrett's WAT$ software.
</P>
<P>
   The results point up some dramatic performance gaps. At $39.895,
second-ranked American Century Ultra is about $4,000 _ 40 monthly
contributions _ ahead of Vanguard Index 500 and more than $10,000
ahead of Fidelity Equity-Income.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard Primecap, the top-performing fund on the list of
$43,476, topped American Century Select by 124 monthly installments
_ quite a feat, considering that the period being measured was only
120 months long.
</P>
<P>
   There was little correlation between a fund's advertised return
and its installment bonus. And in the case of Fidelity Contrafund,
an installment penalty seemed to be the price of a constantly
escalating net asset value.
</P>
<P>
   There are other surprises hidden in the numbers. Look at where
Vanguard Index 500, which mirrors the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Stock
Index, ranks on the list _ 9th out of 22 equity funds (Fidelity
Puritan and Dodge &AMP; Cox Balanced are balanced funds.)
</P>
<P>
   This means that 36 percent of the leading 401(k) funds beat the
market.
</P>
<P>
   During the same ten-year period _ one that marked the rise of
index investing _ only 16.4 percent of all domestic equity funds
could make that claim.
</P>
<P>
   In this connection, it's worth pointing out that the average
domestic equity fund now has an expense ratio of 1.43 percent a
year, but not one of the funds on this list has an expense ratio
over 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To see if there's a way to use this information to select funds,
I conducted a simple exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Since Fidelity is by far the dominant mutual-fund company in the
401(k) world, I figured that for many 401(k) investors picking an
investment boils down to choosing among managed Fidelity funds such
as Magellan, Growth &AMP; Income, Contrafund, and Equity-Income, or
buying an index fund.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at each of five ten-year periods between 1986 and 1999,
I used the WAT$ software to learn which of those funds provided the
largest ten-year accumulation with the greatest consistency.
</P>
<P>
   Not Equity-Income. It finished last for the ten-year periods
ending in 1999, 1998, 1997, 1996, and 1995. It wasn't Magellan,
either. For all the fuss over its performance this year, it never
came in better than third.
</P>
<P>
   The index fund? Nope. It came in third or fourth most of the
time _ but it beat Magellan in three of the five most recent
periods. The respected Growth &AMP; Income fund was fairly consistent
second.
</P>
<P>
   The winner for all five ten-year periods was Contrafund, giving
401(k) investors one more piece of good news.
</P>
<P>
   Contrafund has been closed to new retail investors since April
1998 but remains open to new money from 401(k)-plan participants. &QL;

A VISION OF SUBURBAN BLISS EDGED WITH IRONY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 19) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (af) 
 Jeffrey Kastner's most recent article for Arts &AMP; Leisure was about
the artists Kristin Jones and Andrew Ginzel.  
 By JEFFREY KASTNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The picture on the back cover of the new edition of Bill Owens'
classic 1970s photographic essay, ``Suburbia,'' says much about
when and where it was taken, and about the delicate balancing act
that characterizes the project of which it is a part.
</P>
<P>
   In the image, a young couple stand in their large, immaculate
kitchen. On the table in front of them sit two icons of abundance,
a bowl overflowing with preternaturally shiny fruit and a chubby
baby. The stylish mother distractedly guides creamed corn into the
child's mouth, while Dad clutches a freshly poured cocktail.
</P>
<P>
   As is often the case with Owens' images, a quote from the
subjects serves as the photo's caption: ``We're really happy. Our
kids are healthy, we eat good food, and we have a really nice
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Healthy kids, a nice house, a cocktail in the evening, connubial
bliss. From our vantage today, across a 30-year gap overgrown with
irony, the sentiments expressed by the couple might seem quaint, as
outdated as the groovy beads and horn-rim glasses they sport.
Indeed, the whole thing might seem like an easy joke at their
expense, were it not, on some basic level, so totally true.
</P>
<P>
   We know almost nothing about these people. But for the moment,
in their comfortable home, with their baby and their bounty, they
do seem really happy in a way that many of us would like to be. So
is this an admiring depiction of a middle-class American dream come
true or an ironic expose of bourgeois materialism? In the carefully
calibrated context of ``Suburbia,'' it turns out to be a little of
each.
</P>
<P>
   Considered a groundbreaking exemplar of documentary photography
upon its publication in 1972, ``Suburbia'' later went out of print,
dropping off the radar in much the same way its creator did. By the
end of that decade _ after showing at institutions like the Museum
of Modern Art and the Smithsonian, winning major awards and
producing two more books _ he decided he could no longer raise a
family on a photographer's wages and quit the art world.
</P>
<P>
   Now ``Suburbia'' is available in a new edition, with a foreword
by the journalist and social historian David Halberstam, published
late last year by Fotofolio. And Owens, today better known as an
authority on brewing beer, is suddenly in vogue again, showing in
major galleries from New York to Paris and, through April 2, in a
retrospective at the San Jose Museum of Art in San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking by telephone from the Hayward, Calif., office where he
publishes American Brewer magazine, Owens, 61, recounted the
development of the ``Suburbia'' project. Born in San Jose and
raised on a farm in Citrus Heights, he was an indifferent student
who flunked out of college and set off on an around-the-world
hitchhiking trip.
</P>
<P>
   After returning to finish school at Chico State College, he did
a Peace Corps stint in Jamaica. When a photographer visited the
village in which he was teaching, Owens' interest was piqued. He
soon picked up the camera and taught himself how to shoot.
</P>
<P>
   On his return to California, Owens found work as a $112-a-week
news photographer for a small newspaper, The Livermore Independent,
in the Bay Area. ``I'd been traveling the world,'' he said, ``and
suddenly I got to Livermore and I was in total culture shock. I had
a wife and a baby and everybody my age already had the house and
the swimming pool and the two cars. I'm shooting the Rotary Club,
the Junior Women's Club and thinking, `Who are these people?' But I
start to get to know them. I'd go out and shoot them for the
newspaper and then think, `Man, I ought to go back and shoot this
on my own time.'''
</P>
<P>
   Eager to make the jump from his journalistic work to a
full-blown documentary project, Owens approached the publisher of a
local magazine, who agreed to purchase some prints. He used the
money to buy a large-format camera and, scaling back his time at
the paper, began working on ``Suburbia,'' shooting every Saturday
over the next year.
</P>
<P>
   An admirer of photographers like Robert Frank and Bruce
Davidson, Owens initially saw ``Suburbia'' less as an art project
than as a kind of anthropological document. Referring to the New
Deal Farm Security Administration, Owens said: ``I was really
influenced by the photographs from the FSA projects. There's one
FSA photo that always stuck in my mind. It's a picture of a woman,
her back is turned to the camera, and all there are on the walls
and along the counter are cabinets. I always wanted to open up the
cabinets and photograph what was inside.''
</P>
<P>
   With ``Suburbia,'' Owens got his chance. Using contacts made
through his newspaper work, as well as through classified ads
seeking subjects for a project on suburban life, he insinuated
himself into the lives of friends and neighbors who sought comfort
and prosperity in the growing suburbs of northern California.
</P>
<P>
   He opened the door on their shag carpeting and flowered
wallpaper; their mirrored bedrooms and paneled rec rooms; their
miniskirts and go-go boots. Whether vacuuming or folding clothes,
paying bills or fixing dinner, the people in Owens' photographs
always seem entirely themselves, for better or worse.
</P>
<P>
   The individual pictures in ``Suburbia'' may sometimes seem
narrow in their documentation of such details, but the story they
tell in aggregate is universal, one of aspiration _ for a better
place with better things, a new way of life in new surroundings, a
piece of the American dream.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the richness of the images Owens made, it was his
decision to pair many of them with quotes he gathered from the
subjects _ after his editor at Straight Arrow Books, the Rolling
Stone imprint that originally published ``Suburbia,'' told him he
had to get releases from everyone he had shot _ that gave the
project its indelible poignancy.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the subjects are speaking of their possessions or their
politics, the captions allow the viewer to measure these people's
image of themselves against the image they present, their hopes and
fears against the quotidian circumstances of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get a lot of compliments on the front room wall,'' says a
carefully coiffed matron in her slightly surreal-looking sitting
room. ``I like Italian Syrocco floral designs over the mantle. It
goes well with the Palos Verde rock fireplace.'' And a young mother
in curlers stands with an infant in a messy kitchen and wonders,
``How can I worry about the damned dishes when there are children
dying in Vietnam?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Suburbia'' sold well for a photo book, going into several
printings. It also earned Owens a reputation in the art world,
gaining him a Guggenheim fellowship and a pair of National
Endowment for the Arts grants that supported his next projects, a
book on groups and rituals called ``Our Kind of People'' and
``Working,'' which documented Americans on the job.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1978, as he embarked on his fourth book project, focusing
on leisure time, Owens found himself increasingly frustrated with
the life of the artist. ``I had no money,'' he said. ``I couldn't
make a living. Then one day I found my Nikon under the seat of my
car and I realized I wasn't a photographer anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Reviving an interest in home brewing, Owens began to study
beer-making, eventually opening one of the nation's first brew
pubs, Buffalo Bill's, in Hayward in 1983. He later opened several
more and eventually began publishing trade magazines for the
industry. It was not until the early 1990s, after much urging by
his longtime friend and patron, Dr. Robert Harshorn Shimshak, that
Owens started to think about photography again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had gotten to know each other in the late 1970s and stayed
friends,'' said Shimshak, a physician and Bay Area art collector.
``I was over at his place in 1992 or 1993 and I asked him what he
was doing with his work _ was he at least taking care of the
negatives? Bill said, `They're all in a trunk in the basement' and
I had a fit. He said, `Well, if you love them so much, why don't
you take care of them?' He put the negatives in my car and said,
`They're yours now.'''
</P>
<P>
   It was Shimshak who suggested a new edition of ``Suburbia.''
Acting as editor, he reworked the book's sequencing, replaced some
of the original black-and-whites and added 20 new color images,
taken in the late '70s. ``The more I collected art,'' Shimshak
said, ``the more I realized that Bill's work wasn't just
influential in the photo world, but also in the art world as a
whole. He was one of the first people to look at something
commonplace, and then take a picture of it that made you really
look at it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost every photo in ``Suburbia'' repays attentive looking,
with details that turn an average photo into a great one. ``We're
really happy ...'' is a case in point. It turns out that the couple
in the picture was chosen not because of its neatly nuclear family,
but because Owens wanted pictures of people with pets and they had
23 cats _ a half-dozen of which appear, on closer examination,
lurking in the corners of the composition.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the cats are not the only stealthy aspect of the image:
subtle dissonances abound, giving it that tension between
celebration and critique that is a trademark of Owens' best work.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a longer look confirms that one of the symbols of
plenty that attend the couple, the bowl of fruit, is as plastic as
the tile-pattern linoleum under their feet. And despite the sunny
positivism on the picture's surface, dusk is falling outside.
</P>
<P>
   Through the sliding glass door, beyond the daisy appliques, you
can make out a power plant in the fading light, its buzzing towers
marching across the horizon, its wires crazing the sunset like
hairline cracks in the otherwise picture-perfect world of suburbia.

EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, BEAUTY WORKS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 19) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like other architects of his generation, Thom Mayne has resisted
beauty. He has evidently considered it a seductive idea that, like
Circe, threatens to take away a big guy's strength. So I am happy
to report that the strength of the new Diamond Ranch High School,
designed by Mayne and his firm, Morphosis, for the Pomona Unified
School District in California, lies precisely in the beauty it
brings to an already spectacular hilltop site in Diamond Bar, 40
miles east of Los Angeles. No loss of power here.
</P>
<P>
   At 56, Mayne has reached a point in his career when commissions
for large public buildings are coming his way. In a recent
monograph, he declares that, unlike most architects, he regards all
his designs, built or unbuilt, as projects. I share that view, up
to a point.
</P>
<P>
   But architecture is a medium that enables architects and others
to negotiate with uncommon depth between their inner and outer
worlds. Buildings exist simultaneously on the material and
metaphoric plane. They let us witness metaphors as rooflines
against sky. That dual identity helps account for the beauty they
offer.
</P>
<P>
   Diamond Ranch High School must be seen, first of all, as a work
of landscape architecture, a field governed, like medicine, by the
rule ``First, do no harm.'' That doesn't mean you're not allowed to
touch the land. Reyner Banham, the first great interpreter of Los
Angeles building, once said, ``Architecture is that which changes
land use.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayne and his project architect, John Enright, and Thomas
Blurock Architects, co-architects for the school district, have
lifted blunt definition to a metaphysical plane.
</P>
<P>
   The steep-sloped 72-acre property was considered unbuildable
before the Pomona Unified School District, the school's enlightened
client, decided to grade it. When Mayne was hired, in 1996, he
determined that the design should integrate the building and the
existing topography. Don't build on the top of a hill, Frank Lloyd
Wright insisted. Build just beneath it, on the brow. Mayne has
heeded that advice.
</P>
<P>
   Almost invisible from the nearby highway, the school is
approached by a winding road, punctuated halfway up by a concrete
sign that previews Mayne's angular, industrial vocabulary. On clear
days (there aren't many), you can see the snow-capped peaks of the
San Bernardino mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Pomona itself stretches out in the valley below, a fine example
of the Southern California sprawl some people consider outrageous
but others find sublime. The school is removed from the sprawl at a
vertical and horizontal distance that gives Pomona a certain Alpine
charm. That's on a very, very clear day.
</P>
<P>
   The hill has been graded in four levels. The highest and lowest
of these are playing fields, planted directly on the land. Rooftop
terraces (above) and parking lots (below) integrate the land with
built structure. So does the plan of the building, which expresses
the school's academic structure.
</P>
<P>
   Physically and academically, it is designed as semi-independent
units that function as schools within the school, which serves
1,200 students, in grades 9 to 12. Instead of science classes in
one area, languages in another, classrooms and faculty offices for
all fields of study are clustered in each unit.
</P>
<P>
   The units are housed in two-story structures arranged along a
central open-air spine, or pedestrian street. Lower-school units
are aligned along the northern side of the spine, upper-school
clusters on the south. The units are also separated by outdoor
terraces and lawns, set at a cross-axis with the spine.
</P>
<P>
   The cross-axial spaces are composite architecture, made of
building, landscaping and views of playing fields, mountains and
sky. Besides providing circulation and a sense of identity for each
unit, these areas are great observation platforms. They root the
school to the site and establish its relationship to the city.
</P>
<P>
   Along the pedestrian street, there is more architecture, less
nature, but the architecture is nature transformed. The angular
forms of the units echo the contours of the mountains. They also
convey the crystalline structure of rock. The shapes recall the
first time you went hiking in the mountains and noticed that rock
is crystal: for a moment, it looks more precious than a gemstone,
because your eyes made the discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Mayne's outdoor pedestrian street produces a similarly magic
effect. One minute you're looking at cheap industrial materials _
concrete, corrugated metal, glass _ and then you notice that you're
walking through a place that's as exceptional and democratic as the
academic village Thomas Jefferson designed for the University of
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   In previous projects, like the Cedars-Sinai Comprehensive Cancer
Center Hospital, Mayne has created sculptures, often suspended in
space, that present the design's vocabulary in microcosmic form.
The device, which resembles a three-dimensional version of the
Russian constructivist Lissitzky's Prouns, has always seemed like a
mannerism.
</P>
<P>
   Mayne has abandoned it at Diamond Ranch. Instead, he clusters
fragments of forms and materials in the corners of the units. This
helps to unify the pedestrian street, and also turns the entire
building into a stylized microcosm of the landscape and the city
that spills across it.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The counterpoint between fluid space and angular form is key to
the design's rhythmic grip. This is processional architecture, but
the sequence of spaces is flexible, mutable, not rigidly
controlled. Surprises abound, like the grand flight of concrete
stairs that doubles as an outdoor amphitheater. Proscenium stages
turn the cafeteria and the gym into performance spaces. The gym
itself is a vast, column-free cavern buttressed by earth.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, Diamond Ranch is going to be compared to a more
recent village, the Getty Center. Both are built on hilltop sites.
Both let in lots of nature. Both use a consistent vocabulary of
materials and forms to unify separate pieces.
</P>
<P>
   But when you visit the Getty, you take in the site, the
landscaping, the acres of travertine, the perfectly enameled metal
panels, and you think: money made this. Big bucks. Lots of dough.
At Diamond Ranch High School, you take in the site, the
landscaping, the cheap metal cladding, the concrete terraces, and
think: poverty made this. Need, resourcefulness and talent. No
expense has been unspared. Where money was lacking, love had to
pitch in. This is not a bad lesson for high school students and the
rest of us who may need refresher courses later on.
</P>
<P>
   It's in the nature of Southern California to hazard such an
odious comparison between a luxurious museum and a public high
school. In this sprawling urban condition, buildings call to one
another across vast distances. The tall buildings of downtown Los
Angeles and Wilshire Boulevard are the Getty's vertical cousins,
the freeway and the ocean its horizontal pals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Connected Isolation'' is Mayne's title for a 1993 monograph of
his work. That idea drives the articulation of the units at Diamond
Ranch, and it also abstracts the region's social ecology.
</P>
<P>
   This building evokes another kind of connectedness, the links
between buildings that represent contemporary urban intelligence.
Imagine being stuck in some suburban community planned by the New
Urbanism. Talk about isolation: the buildings are close together
but disconnected from anything larger than market research.
</P>
<P>
   But go to Mayne's Diamond Ranch High School, Peter Eisenman's
Wexner Center for Art in Columbus, Ohio, or Tod Williams and Billie
Tsien's Neurosciences Institute in La Jolla, and you step through
the window to a wider world. The horizon expands. We hear a lot
about sense of place, and this school certainly provides it. But it
also addresses an adolescent impulse as prevalent in the suburbs as
the desire for roots. It goes, ``Get Me Outta Here!''
</P>
<P>
   I don't think Thom Mayne has ever been accused of sweetness.
Abrasive is more like it. Sore-thumbed. Hard-edged, sometimes to
the point of coldness. At Kate Mantilini, the Beverly Hills
restaurant he designed in 1986, you often feel at risk of
hypothermia, and not because of the air-conditioning. Diamond Ranch
has bite but no chill. This is partly due to the presence of
schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   But the warmth is also due to smooth contours of the landscape,
which is intensified by the building's angular forms. And the light
pulled down by the metal cladding has an almost physical softness.
There are spots where you look out from a height over the playing
fields toward Pomona and the mountains beyond. You can't quite hear
the athletes' voices. The atmosphere is pure potential. You've been
here before: you recognize the altitude from dreams.
</P>
<P>
   I sympathize with those who prefer old school buildings to
modern ones. But age isn't what makes them appealing. It's their
weirdness, their misfit quality, the comic images they summon up of
theater owners unplugging the soundtrack at showings of ``Rock
Around the Clock.'' Collegiate Gothic style, come to think of it,
is pure Addams Family values.
</P>
<P>
   There's one supremely Gothic moment at Diamond Ranch: an outdoor
courtyard that adjoins the faculty lounge. The courtyard's concrete
walls are three stories tall, and virtually windowless. One can
envision teachers walking there silently in a circle during breaks.
The height of the space is exaggerated by a parapet designed to
prevent students from peering down from above, but this protective
device is also a flagrant invitation to toss water balloons and
other ritual offerings over the side. The Mayans never built ball
courts more awesome than this.

CALIF. UNIVISION WORKERS IN 4TH WEEK OF HUNGER STRIKE OVER WAGES
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif.)  (fb) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRESNO, Calif. _ Refusing to eat solid foods for the last three
weeks, broadcast journalists have joined television cameramen and
technicians at a television station here in a hunger strike to
demand better wages and other terms in the station's first union
contract.
</P>
<P>
   The strike at KFTV, Channel 21, a Spanish-language station of
the Univision network, began nearly four weeks ago. Three of the
eight strikers who began fasting on Feb. 17, including a union
negotiator, were still having no solid food on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 21 station employees who joined the Communication Workers
of America in May 1999, seven went on the fast, saying that
although they worked at the highest-rated television station in the
area, their salaries were below those paid by English-language
stations in the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to take a drastic measure to let people become aware
that discrimination, labor abuses and exploitation of workers
happens even at the highest levels,'' said Fermin Chavez, the
anchor at Channel 21, who subsisted on juice while continuing to
give his newscasts. ``It doesn't just occur out in the fields or in
small businesses, but even at companies like Univision.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, 15 pounds lighter and complaining of weakness and
cramps, broke his fast with a bowl of chicken soup on Wednesday
night, saying he was following doctors' orders. That left three on
the fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about trying to be Gandhi,'' Chavez said. ``We were
not being taken seriously and had to make a point.''
</P>
<P>
   The general manager of the station, Maria L. Gutierrez, called
the hunger strike a melodramatic gesture. ``This is a
garden-variety labor dispute in connection with a first contract,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Channel 21, with 54 employees, is one of 19 stations owned by
Univision, the largest Spanish-language network in the country,
with about 30 broadcast affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   Reina Cardenas, a reporter, is paid $25,300 a year and has been
offered a $1,200 raise, she said. Chavez, 37, who anchors the
station's noon and 11 p.m. newscasts, makes $35,000.
</P>
<P>
   Anchors at local ABC and NBC affiliates in Fresno make $80,000
to $100,000 a year, says Carrie Biggs-Adams, the contract
negotiator who is on hunger strike.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesperson for Univision stated that its wages could not be
compared with those of networks with more means.

DEMOCRATS DEVISE AN ALTERNATIVE TO CLINTON'S DRUG PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN.: Fla, N.D., Va.) (fb) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Moderate Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee
are drafting their own proposal to offer prescription drug coverage
to Medicare beneficiaries, as an alternative to President Clinton's
plan, and they say their ideas could be a basis for a bipartisan
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, like one advanced by Clinton last June, would
offer drug coverage to all Medicare beneficiaries. But it differs
from the Clinton plan in important ways.
</P>
<P>
   The senators, led by Bob Graham of Florida, said the coverage
under their proposal would look more like true insurance. They
would require people to pay a deductible, perhaps $250 a year,
before getting drug benefits from Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan has no deductible. He boasts that his proposal
would help pay drug costs from the first dollar of the first
prescription.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials welcomed Graham's effort. ``Conceptually,
it's consistent with what the president has proposed,'' said Chris
Jennings, the health policy coordinator at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on the Finance Committee said that they had not been
briefed on details of Graham's proposal, but that they had worked
well with Democrats on several issues in recent few years, and
expected to do so on drug benefits this year.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., said he was ``very interested'' in
Graham's approach and expected to introduce a similar bill in the
House.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Democratic senators' proposal, the federal
contribution would increase gradually, so the government would pay
a growing share as a person's drug costs rose.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, for example, the beneficiary might have to pay all of the
first $250 in drug costs, then half of the next $750. The
beneficiary's share would decline and would be limited; the
government would pay all of a beneficiary's drug expenses beyond a
certain amount, say $3,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Under Clinton's plan, the government would pay half the drug
costs incurred by any Medicare beneficiary who signed up for
coverage. The maximum federal payment would start at $1,000 a year
in 2003 and rise to $2,500 in 2009. In a late addition to his
budget this year, Clinton sought more money to assist people with
very high drug costs, but he has not given any details concerning
how he wants to use the money.
</P>
<P>
   The moderate Democratic senators are also considering a proposal
charging higher premiums for drug coverage to beneficiaries with
incomes above certain levels _ say $75,000 a year for an individual
and $100,000 for a couple. Under this arrangement, drug benefits
would be available to all, as Clinton wants, but the government
would provide larger subsidies to beneficiaries with low or
moderate incomes.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 70 to 30, the Senate in 1997 endorsed the idea that
affluent elderly people should pay higher premiums for basic
Medicare coverage. But lobbyists for the elderly opposed the idea,
and it never became law.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said that ``the Finance Committee, with a large number of
knowledgeable and pragmatic moderates,'' was the best forum in
which to forge a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said that in town hall meetings with elderly constituents
in Orlando, St. Petersburg and Sarasota, Fla., only a third said
they would sign up for Clinton's plan.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said the support was low because ``they viewed the
Clinton plan as prepayment for known obligations, rather than as
insurance against an uncertain future risk. I think it's more
desirable for Medicare to follow the insurance model.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Clinton's proposal, Medicare beneficiaries would pay
premiums of about $25 a month, or $300 a year, for drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Graham said, ``to make it worthwhile,'' beneficiaries
would need to have more than $600 a year in drug expenses, and
fewer than one-third of beneficiaries do.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's plan also calls for premiums; on average, he said, they
would be no higher than the president's.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Democrats with whom Graham is working include Kent
Conrad of North Dakota, Richard H. Bryan of Nevada and Charles S.
Robb of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see this as a refinement of the president's proposal,''
Conrad said. ``It's appropriate to have a deductible so the first
expenses fall on the beneficiary. For the government to provide
first-dollar coverage would be very expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryan said: ``The public demand is reaching a critical mass.
Republicans and Democrats alike want to be able to say at the end
of this Congress that we enacted a Medicare drug benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   The House Budget Committee is scheduled to meet on Wednesday to
approve a blueprint for federal spending. House Republicans said
they would set aside $40 billion over the next five years to help
low-income elderly pay for prescription drugs. That sum is similar
to the amount Clinton would spend in the first five years of his
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. William V. Roth Jr., the Delaware Republican who is
chairman of the Finance Committee and is running for re-election,
said he also intended to send Medicare drug legislation to the
Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   Graham recalled the fiasco after Congress expanded Medicare in
1988 to cover catastrophic illnesses and prescription drugs. The
extra coverage was partly financed by a surtax on the elderly, many
of whom concluded the extra benefits were not worth the added cost.
Congress repealed the law a year later.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said he worried that Clinton's plan might meet with ``a
repetition of that experience, as the elderly put pencil to paper
and decide not to participate.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Bernae Gunderson, a certified paralegal who lives in St. Paul,
is not intimidated by fine print. But she was still puzzled by the
mortgage documents she got in May 1998 from First Alliance Corp.
This did not sound like the affordable home equity loan that she
and her husband had been promised.
</P>
<P>
   So at about 2:30 p.m. on May 26, Gunderson called the manager of
the mortgage company's local office and asked all the right
questions about rates, monthly payments and fees. And she got
reassuring answers that confirmed her understanding of the terms of
her loan.
</P>
<P>
   But those comforting answers were mostly lies, as revealed in a
tape-recording Gunderson made of her conversation to play later for
her husband, Scott. In fact, $13,000 in fees were added to the
loan, and its interest rate was designed to rise a full percentage
point every six months. Facing mortgage payments already $150 a
month higher than when they first closed on the loan, the
Gundersons have been forced to work as much as 10 extra hours a
week to meet their payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have three children, and an extra $150 a month really can
help out for clothing and everything else,'' said Scott Gunderson
in a recent interview. ``It does make a lot of difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gunderson added, ``The stress is unbearable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gundersons are among scores of consumers who have complained
to state regulators about First Alliance, a national home-equity
lender based in Irvine, Calif. More than a dozen have already sued.
They all assert that the company has used a deceptive sales pitch,
delivered by loan officers recruited from big auto dealerships, to
lure homeowners into high-cost loans that expose them to the threat
of foreclosure and financial ruin.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which steadfastly denies wrongdoing, has also been
sued by the American Association of Retired Persons and by
regulators in California, Washington state, Minnesota,
Massachusetts and Illinois. Washington state is seeking to suspend
it from doing any business there. The company has already stopped
doing business in Minnesota. Florida is considering legal action. A
California appeals court concluded last year that the company
``trained its employees to use various methods, including
deception, to sell its services.'' The U.S. Justice Department is
investigating First Alliance, and the company has withdrawn from an
industry trade association because of negative publicity.
</P>
<P>
   But First Alliance still has some very important supporters: the
investment banks on Wall Street that help it raise the money lent
out to people like the Gundersons. Those banks began raising
significant amounts money for the company in the early 1990s, after
it had already come under investigation in California for
discriminatory lending. An investigation by The New York Times and
the ABC News program ``20/20'' shows they have pumped hundreds of
millions of dollars more into First Alliance in recent years, even
as civil lawsuits and state investigations have raised increasingly
troubling questions about First Alliance's business practices.
</P>
<P>
   The money raised by Wall Street for First Alliance and dozens of
similar companies has financed a quiet revolution in the financial
habits of millions of Americans whose low incomes or blemished
credit histories otherwise prevented them from obtaining
conventional loans. Such ``subprime'' borrowers, as they are called
in the lending industry, have turned in increasing numbers to
finance companies that cover the risk of default by charging them
significantly higher fees and interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1989, Wall Street investment banks have sold more than
$316.2 billion in bonds for subprime lenders _ more than twice the
dollar amount of the high-yield, or ``junk,'' bonds that companies
used to finance takeovers the 1980s. First Alliance has been a big
beneficiary of these new mortgage bonds, receiving nearly $2
billion the last decade, including $103 million raised through
Lehman Brothers just three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   William J. Ahearn, a spokesman for Lehman, said the firm's role
in selling bonds backed by subprime loans, known in the financial
world as underwriting, includes a careful review to make sure
investors have the facts they need. He said Lehman officials
believe that First Alliance had stepped up its efforts the last 18
months to prevent abuses. Lehman, he said, is an ``underwriter, not
a regulator.''
</P>
<P>
   For much of the last decade, the federal government has largely
left regulation of the industry to the states, despite a series of
congressional hearings that revealed rampant abuses. The first
round of hearings, in 1994, established that many companies were
taking advantage of unsophisticated homeowners _ many of them
members of minorities; the second round, in 1998, suggested that
the problems were spreading nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony did not dissuade Wall Street investment banks from
vastly expanding their stake in the industry. They have financed
lending operations, helped companies sell shares to the public and,
in some cases, even formed partnerships with the companies.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates contend that First Alliance, whose actions
have been extensively documented in court cases and regulatory
actions, is typical of an industry that often preys on low- and
middle-income people desperate to escape financial difficulties.
Industry officials say, however, that subprime lenders can provide
a valuable service to consumers whose credit records otherwise
disqualify them for conventional loans.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, First Alliance denies ``in the strongest terms''
that it has a companywide practice of deceiving borrowers and has
described some cases cited in regulatory documents as isolated
instances of misunderstandings involving a few loan officers. It
says it is providing a service to people who would otherwise be
unable to obtain credit, and insists that its fees _ which it says
are now lower, on average, than they once were _ are justified by
the dangers of lending money to the nation's riskiest borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``First Alliance's business model is to charge a higher
origination fee than most, offset by a lower interest rate than
most,'' explained Brian Chisick, the company's founder and chief
executive. That, he continued, gives consumers lower monthly
payments and lower total payments over the life of the loan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most borrowers are much more concerned about their monthly
payment than the amount of any fees,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Critics counter that, in fact, many First Alliance borrowers _
who regulators say are largely people with decent credit histories
_ wind up paying higher fees on top of higher interest rates than
are justified by the risks the lender is taking.
</P>
<P>
   While a few regulators have challenged its high fees, most of
the litigation currently pending against First Alliance focuses on
the elaborate script its loan officers have been trained to use.
The script, regulators say, is designed to deflect questions about
rates and fees, swamp borrowers under masses of needless detail and
foster a trusting atmosphere that would encourage customers to
lower their guard.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Gunderson was still wary enough to double-check her
loan with First Alliance, and to tape the call on her telephone
answering machine.
</P>
<P>
   Worried about the $13,000 in fees, she sought confirmation that
her loan was for about $47,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right, your amount financed is $46,172,'' the loan officer,
Brian Caffrey, assured her. ``That doesn't change.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right, right,'' she continued. ``And then the $13,000 goes on
top of that? And then interest is charged?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, no,'' he responded.
</P>
<P>
   But the answer should have been yes, yes, yes _ the fees were
added to the $46,172 that the Gundersons thought they had borrowed,
and they are paying interest on those fees over the life of the
loan.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Caffrey said in a recent interview that he was just following
the script First Alliance trained him to use _ an excuse strongly
disputed by Chisick, who said all company loan officers ``are
specifically trained to insure borrower understanding of all
aspects of their loan.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gunderson later shared her tape-recording with the
Minnesota attorney general's office, which attached a transcript of
it to court documents filed in its case against First Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything they told us made sense,'' she said, ``but they
were lying through their teeth. And they told all kinds of people
the same things that they told us. We just happened to be lucky
enough to push a button.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   THE BUSINESS: Making Loans By the Script  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At age 60, Brian Chisick has the tanned, broad-shouldered good
looks of a native California surfer. But he was born in London,
where he lived until age 14, when his family moved to Vancouver,
British Columbia. In 1963, he relocated to Orange County, Calif.,
where after a briefly varied career _ he once sold office machines,
for example _ he found his way into the mortgage business.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, Chisick and his wife, Sarah, opened First Alliance
Mortgage Co., a consumer finance company that would ultimately rely
on two sources of strength: an aggressive sales force recruited
from auto dealerships and a ready access to Wall Street money.
</P>
<P>
   In its early days, his company was just one of many mom-and-pop
consumer finance companies that competed, with only middling
success, against stronger savings and loan institutions and
commercial banks. But before First Alliance was a decade old,
rocketing interest rates and financial deregulation had turned its
world upside down.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, in an effort to salvage the battered savings and loan
industry, Congress effectively repealed most state laws limiting
the interest rates that lenders could charge for first mortgages on
residential property. Two years later, Congress erased most state
restrictions on ``alternative'' loans, including adjustable-rate
mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   These steps, intended to help the savings and loan industry,
also benefited small consumer finance companies like Chisick's.
Over the next decade their share of the home-equity loan market
exploded, rising to 32 percent in 1989 from less than 0.5 percent
in 1977, according to a recent study by Cathy Lesser Mansfield, a
consumer law professor at Drake University in Des Moines.
</P>
<P>
   Chisick's company flourished in this new competitive
environment, and by 1988 he had opened lending offices in seven
communities across California. To staff them, he recruited highly
paid automobile salespeople, who were at ease with the ``hard
sell'' but tired of the long evening hours and weekend work that
auto sales involved.
</P>
<P>
   Recruits were required to commit to memory an elaborate 27-page
sales pitch _ known in the early days as ``The Loan Officer's Track
to Run On,'' later shortened to the Track.
</P>
<P>
   According to court documents filed in a 1988 case in California,
loan officers were drilled until they could deliver the sales
message flawlessly, slipping back into the script regardless of the
questions customers might raise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Establish a common bond,'' the loan officers were taught.
``Find this early in the conversation to make the customer lower
his guard.'' The script listed good bond-building topics (family,
jobs, children and pets) and emphasized, ``It's really important to
get them laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   It offered another bit of advice: ``To soften the blow of dollar
amounts, say: `merely,' `simply,' `only,' `as you know.'''
</P>
<P>
   And if the customer asks questions about the rate and the fees?
Just say, ``May I ignore your concern about the rate and costs if I
can show you that these are minor issues in a loan?''
</P>
<P>
   The company insisted that its employees stick to the script, and
managers monitored the loan officers over office intercom systems
to make sure they did, according to court documents and numerous
interviews with former employees.

</P>
<P>
   In 1988, with testimony from several company whistle-blowers,
lawyers for the California Department of Corporations accused the
company of imposing harsher terms on loans made to homeowners in
neighborhoods with high minority populations _ areas that loan
officers referred to as ``never-never land,'' according to the
state's lawsuit. Regulators also complained that the company's
sales pitch deliberately obscured the high points and other fees
that borrowers paid.
</P>
<P>
   Chisick's lawyers denied racial discrimination and said the
``never-never land'' list had been prepared by some unknown
employee, had not been used for at least five years and had never
been sanctioned by First Alliance management. In April 1989, First
Alliance paid $420,000 to settle the state lawsuit, denying
wrongdoing but submitting to two years of state monitoring and
agreeing to conduct racial sensitivity training for its staff.
</P>
<P>
   Eight months later, a consumer class-action suit filed in
Oakland accused the company of fraudulently concealing its fees and
imposing excessive and unjustified charges on borrowers. In 1994,
again without acknowledging any liability, the company paid $6.85
million to settle the case.
</P>
<P>
   In its early days, First Alliance raised money for its
operations primarily by selling bundles of loans directly to
private investors. But in 1993, despite its earlier regulatory
trouble and the still-pending consumer lawsuit, it tapped into a
much deeper, less expensive source of fresh capital: Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of bonds backed by packages of lower-quality mortgage
loans was not a new idea, and some small deals had been done as
early as 1989. But by the mid-1990s, with professional investors
hungry for higher-yielding investments, major Wall Street
investment banks stepped up the volume of loan-backed bonds sold to
pension funds and other institutions. Suddenly, a vastly larger
pool of money became available to subprime lenders like First
Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The process works like this: Wall Street bankers invite
investors, typically large institutions like pensions funds and
universities, to buy certificates that pay an attractive interest
rate over many years. The money raised from those investors is then
used to buy groups of loans taken out by consumers through
companies like First Alliance. The borrowers' monthly payments
cover the interest paid to investors plus a profit to First
Alliance. The certificates are roughly equivalent to mutual fund
shares, with investors owning a portfolio of loans rather than
stocks or bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1994 and 1996, the amount of money raised on Wall Street
for subprime lenders rocketed. In 1996 nearly $40 billion worth of
subprime loan notes were sold, up from just over $10 billion the
year before; within two years, the annual volume was $87 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The business was attractive to Wall Street for two reasons.
First, investment banks collected fees for arranging the deals _
usually about a third of a penny for every dollar raised. Second,
doing the deals gave the investment bankers a steady supply of the
popular high-yielding mortgage notes to sell to their institutional
customers, who would otherwise shop elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   By 1996, most of the big investment banks on Wall Street, and
some large commercial banks, had plunged into the subprime
business; the resulting flood of cash was like a dose of steroids
for the industry.

   With Wall Street's demand in overdrive, ``lenders and mortgage
brokers went out and tried to make as many loans as they could to
meet the demand,'' explained Jeffrey Zeltzer, executive director of
the National Home Equity Mortgage Association, which represents
subprime lenders.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   First Alliance was one of the big beneficiaries of this
development. John D. Dewey, the consultant who advised the company
on its first Wall Street deals, recalled that its business grew
more than sixfold once it had access to mortgage market financing.
</P>
<P>
   First Alliance's profitability improved significantly as well,
since it was paying around 6 percent interest on the money it
raised on Wall Street and could lend that money to consumers at an
average interest rate of 14 percent, Dewey said.
</P>
<P>
   The company expanded, and today operates in more than a dozen
states from Washington to Florida. California remains its biggest
source of customers, but New York, New Jersey and Illinois are
close behind.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by the robust health that Wall Street's money had
generated, First Alliance was able to sell its own shares to public
investors in 1996, in a deal that allowed the Chisicks to draw $135
million out of the company.

<P>
   While not politically active, they were generous with their new
wealth, contributing to a religious academy in Huntington Beach,
Calif., and building the Chisick Auditorium for the Jewish
Community Center of Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   The Chisicks' three sons, Jamie, Brad and Mark, have followed
their father into the subprime lending business, operating two
affiliated lending companies that have had their own troubles with
regulators in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   But life is not all mortgages and philanthropy for the Chisicks.
They are listed in property records as the owners of an expensive
condominium in Honolulu and a home in a gated community in Santa
Ana, Calif., which they bought after their successful public stock
offering in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The year the Chisicks finally grasped the brass ring of
extraordinary wealth was also the year that a number of elderly
First Alliance customers in the San Jose area began to worry about
losing the roofs over their heads.

</P>
<P>
   THE VICTIMS: Facing Ruin Under a Pile of Fees
</P>
<P>
   First Alliance says it charges high fees because its borrowers
have less-than-perfect credit records and are more likely to
default on their loans.
</P>
<P>
   But the company tells a different tale to Wall Street. In
documents intended to attract investors, it points out that more
than three-fourths of its loans are made to people with relatively
good credit histories.
</P>
<P>
   A former loan officer said the company makes little effort to
distinguish between customers with poor records and those with good
credit history, who would qualify for conventional loans.
</P>
<P>
   At First Alliance, ``customers with `A' credit would pay the
same high loan fees as customers with `D' credit,'' according to a
sworn affidavit by Greg Walling, a First Alliance
loan-officer-turned-whistleblower who has cooperated with various
state regulators. His suburban Minneapolis office was a few dozen
yards from a conventional branch bank, he said in a recent
interview. ``I wanted to tell some of my better customers that
every step they took from my door to that bank would save them
$1,000 on their loan.''
</P>
<P>
   He was not exaggerating. Court record show that the company has
charged loan origination fees, called ``points,'' of 25 percent or
more on some loans, in addition to high interest rates and big
penalties for early repayment.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Chisick said the company had recently reduced
its origination fees to an average of about 10 percent because of
what he called the ``sound-bite effect of the high origination
fees.''
</P>
<P>
   Few conventional lenders charge origination fees of more than
two points on a loan _ that is 2 percent of the total amount _ and
many state regulators consider fees of more than eight points to be
indefensible.
</P>
<P>
   For someone borrowing $100,000 from First Alliance, a fee of 25
points adds $25,000 to the amount on which the customer is paying
interest.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The calculation has become all too familiar to Velda Durney, one
of the homeowners who have sued First Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Durney's brother built her sage-green ranch house in Fremont,
Calif., outside San Jose, in the summer of 1966. It is filled with
evidence of a life well lived: photographs of happy school-age
grandchildren, fresh-baked carrot cakes cooling in the kitchen, a
bowling trophy-laden sideboard, pushed aside to make room for a
quilting frame.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband died soon after the house was finished, and she
raised her six children there alone, working for 23 years as a
sales clerk at Sears. She managed on a small pension and Social
Security _ until August 1996, when she refinanced her home through
First Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Durney believed she had signed for an 8.5 percent
adjustable-rate mortgage for $51,493 that would consolidate a few
credit card bills and lower her total monthly payments. In fact,
after more than 26 points in fees were added, her loan was for
$64,590, and its rate was scheduled to climb every six months until
her monthly payments would equal or exceed her original mortgage
payments.
</P>
<P>
   Her income simply would not stretch that far, and she began to
have nightmares that she would lose her home.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about that loan in an interview in January, the capable
Durney slumped into a kitchen chair, tears suddenly spilling from
behind her stylish wire-framed glasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't talk about it without crying,'' she apologized. ``It
took away every shred of self-confidence I had.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides her peace of mind, she has also lost her privacy. She
had to refinance again to get a fixed-rate mortgage, and her
monthly payments are still bigger than her pension income will
cover. So she makes ends meet, she said, by renting out her two
spare bedrooms _ which she had done as a favor to church
acquaintances in the past but now does with strangers, by
necessity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting by,'' she said last week, ``but just barely.''
</P>
<P>
   Chisick said he could not comment extensively on the case
because it was still in litigation, but he denied wrongdoing. He
added, ``All borrowers are given two separate, three-day periods to
reject the terms of the obligation. She decided not to.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed and Joanne Pagter, who lived in nearby Santa Clara, had their
own money worries as 1996 began. Mr. Pagter, then 67, ran a
part-time pool maintenance business that added about $800 a month
to the $735 he got from Social Security. But he was suffering from
severe kidney disease and was unsure how long he would be able to
work. Mrs. Pagter, who earned just over $2,100 a month, was nearing
retirement from her job at a corporate cafeteria service.
</P>
<P>
   They had abundant equity in their home, but their main financial
problem was an adjustable-rate mortgage that was scheduled to
increase Jan. 1 unless they could replace it with a loan that
required lower monthly payments.
</P>
<P>
   First Alliance, which had been calling them on a weekly basis
for several years, assured them that they could. So in January
1996, the couple visited the company's San Jose office.
</P>
<P>
   According to a lawsuit they later filed, the Pagters told
Jeffrey E.A. Phillips, a First Alliance loan officer, that their
goal was to keep payments as low as possible for the next year so
that they could save more, and then to sell their home after Mrs.
Pagter retired and buy a house near their daughter, who lives in
Lemoore, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The Pagters say they were rushed through the closing, signing
documents they were not given time to read. Not until October 1996,
when they were selling their Santa Clara home and trying to close
on their new one, did they discover the exact terms of their loan,
according to their lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   They had actually borrowed $170,264 from First Alliance _
including an origination fee of 13 points, or $19,950 _ not
$147,000 as they believed. This decreased the equity they had in
their old home, so they had to borrow more money, and quickly, to
close on the new house.
</P>
<P>
   THE COUNTERATTACK: Building a Case Against Deception
</P>
<P>
   Looking for help, the Pagters turned to Steinbock &AMP; Hofmann, a
three-person San Jose law firm that was already representing a
number of elderly homeowners with very similar complaints against
First Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The cases became the special passion of Sheila Canavan, the
firm's associate. Working on a shoestring _ and chided by friends
who saw parallels with the financially doomed lawyers in the movie
``A Civil Action'' _ the firm was representing five other
homeowners, all complaining of deceptive sales practices by First
Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, investigators in the state Department of
Financial Institutions in Olympia, Wash., had opened a file on
First Alliance, on the basis of 17 consumer complaints similar to
those made by Durney and the Pagters.
</P>
<P>
   State officials immediately focused on a 1996 version of the
Track, the sales script that the company's loan officers used in
their dealings with customers. In June 1997, in an affidavit filed
in state court, the lead investigator, Chuck Cross, observed that
First Alliance's intent ``appears to be to continually play down
the import of certain disclosures, misdirect crucial information or
confuse the borrower about what they are actually obtaining in the
transaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Cross was especially concerned that the script borrowed terms
from the federal disclosure documents, like ``amount financed,''
and gave them new and misleading definitions. Loan origination fees
were never called ``points,'' he said, but instead ``prepaid
finance charges,'' or ``minimum finance charges.'' And they were
labeled estimates when they were actually firm amounts.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators in other states sought copies of that 1996 sales
script, but First Alliance obtained a court order requiring
Washington regulators to keep the document secret _ an order that
remains in place today. (Last March, First Alliance notified the
state that it intended to sue Cross and his superiors for
defamation.)
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1997, Canavan and her partners in San Jose had
filed lawsuits against First Alliance on behalf of the Pagters,
Durney and four other area homeowners. The company mounted an
aggressive defense, insisting that all the terms on the loans had
been fully and clearly disclosed. Company lawyers pointed out that
by signing closing statements, borrowers had attested to fully
understanding the terms of their loans.
</P>
<P>
   Several borrowers in the lawsuit said they had signed the forms
in a rush, without having had time to examine them carefully.
Others said they had been advised to ignore information in the
forms that differed from what they had been told by a loan officer.
Still others said they had been assured that the information was in
error and would be corrected, or depicted a worst-case scenario
that was unlikely to arise.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Pagter case in San Jose began to inch toward
trial. The company tried to shunt the case off to arbitration, but
a state appeals court, in a crucial ruling, concluded that the
elderly couple's signature on a form agreeing to forgo lawsuits had
been `` obtained by fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   In the decision, the court sharply criticized First Alliance,
which it said had ``trained its employees to use various methods,
including deception, to sell its services.''
</P>
<P>
   In his written response, Chisick called the ruling ``incorrect''
and ``a blatant error.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, in February 1999, gave the Pagters hope, but
settlement discussions with First Alliance dragged through 1999 and
broke off inconclusively early this year. It was not until a day
after a jury had been chosen for a January trial in San Jose that
First Alliance agreed to pay an undisclosed sum to settle the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed and I used to joke that they were just waiting for us all
to die,'' said Mrs. Pagter. The joke was prophetic. Ed Pagter died
last October.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why First Alliance had delayed a settlement for so long,
given Mr. Pagter's ill health, Chisick said, ``Mr. Pagter was ill
when he borrowed the money, so the advancement of his illness was
not a factor.''
</P>
<P>
   GROWING OPPOSITION: Picking Up Allies With Influence  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even an attentive Wall Street investment banker might have
missed the early local headlines critical of First Alliance. But
the company's legal troubles attracted national attention in May
1998, when the Pagters and their fellow plaintiffs gained a
powerful new ally in their fight: the giant AARP.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Constantine Davis, a staff lawyer, said the AARP had been
approached by Canavan's firm and ``decided this was definitely
something we wanted to look into.''
</P>
<P>
   The organization was taking advantage of an unusual facet of
California's business laws, called Section 17200, that allows a
plaintiff to sue as a ``private attorney general,'' seeking
restitution on behalf of all citizens affected by certain deceptive
business practices.
</P>
<P>
   State regulators, too, were heading to court. By the end of
1998, Minnesota Attorney General Hubert H. Humphrey III had sued
First Alliance, accusing it of deceptive sales practices. In
Massachusetts, an assistant attorney general, Pamela S. Kogut, had
obtained a temporary injunction forcing the company to limit its
origination fees to eight points _ although a top company executive
had argued in court that the company could not make a profit with
fees that low. And in Illinois, Attorney General Jim Ryan was suing
as well, seeking remedies that included the rescission of all the
loans First Alliance has made there.
</P>
<P>
   Steve LeClair, an assistant attorney general in Florida, says
that his staff has subpoenaed a ``very large volume of records''
and is talking with First Alliance ``to see if this is something we
can resolve without filing a formal complaint.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida's primary concern is the origination fees. ``They're
just so excessively high that it's hard for me to conceive of any
way a consumer would agree to that kind of loan if all the facts
have been put before them,'' LeClair said.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, after years of legal fencing with First Alliance,
Washington state regulators finally filed a formal complaint
against the company, seeking to suspend its license for two years
and to obtain an order that it discontinue deceptive practices.
</P>
<P>
   And in September, First Alliance agreed to settle the consumer
protection lawsuits filed against it in Minnesota. While
acknowledging no wrongdoing, the company agreed to offer each of
its Minnesota customers $4,000 to $6,000 and to read any new
customers a simple court-ordered description of its fees and rates
before any loan discussions began.
</P>
<P>
   Prentiss Cox, a Minnesota assistant attorney general, said the
company no longer did business in his state. ``That kind of relief
suggests the strength of our allegations in the case.''
</P>
<P>
   But at best, regulatory efforts like Minnesota's can only
protect a statewide segment of consumers; companies can
short-circuit such investigations simply by pulling out of one
state and moving into another. Some states have strong, clear
consumer lending laws and well-financed regulatory agencies _ but
others do not.
</P>
<P>
   The early waves of scandal from the subprime industry a decade
ago prompted Congress in 1994 to adopt legislation requiring
greater disclosure by high-cost lenders, but federal action to
enforce those laws has been rare. Indeed, the Federal Trade
Commission filed the first disciplinary cases under the 1994 law
just last summer.
</P>
<P>
   And yet none of these legal problems seems to shake Wall
Street's faith in First Alliance or most of the other large
subprime lenders that have been the targets of consumer advocates'
complaints. To be sure, the high-yield mortgage market grew a bit
jittery in late 1998, after revelations of some subprime lenders'
questionable accounting practices. But last year, there were more
than 200 separate deals totaling more than $75 billion _ less than
in 1998 but more than in any other previous year.
</P>
<P>
   THE WALL STREETERS: Raising Money In the Best Circles  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No Wall Street investment bank had a bigger share of that
reviving 1999 market than Lehman Brothers, Wall Street's
fourth-largest brokerage house and one of its oldest and most
prestigious names.
</P>
<P>
   First Alliance's initial public offering in 1996 was handled by
Friedman Billings &AMP; Ramsey, a small investment bank based in
Arlington, Va. But through the late 1990s, First Alliance had
raised money through a variety of bigger banks and brokerage
houses, including Prudential Securities. Then about two years ago,
as the AARP lawsuit was added to First Alliance's legal troubles,
Lehman Brothers became the company's primary source of financing.
In all, it has handled eight separate deals for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman Brothers has not only helped raise money for First
Alliance despite its mounting legal troubles but, more recently,
has taken a small investment stake in the firm.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ahearn, the Lehman spokesman, pointed out that the brokerage
house's deals for First Alliance ``have been relatively small''
compared with Lehman's deals for other companies. And he emphasized
that all of First Alliance's mounting legal troubles were carefully
reviewed by Lehman and fully disclosed to investors who bought the
notes backed by First Alliance mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Nor did First Alliance's legal difficulties dissuade another
important Wall Street supporter: MBIA Insurance, the giant
financial insurance company, which has stood behind many of First
Alliance's loan deals over the years, guaranteeing that principal
and interest will be paid to investors promptly. With MBIA's
backing, First Alliance's mortgage-backed notes were awarded Wall
Street's highest credit ratings, making them more attractive to
institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Legan, a managing director of MBIA, said that his company
became increasingly concerned last year about the problem of
predatory lending in the subprime market and that it had recently
expanded the scope of its review of each subprime deal it agreed to
insure.
</P>
<P>
   First Alliance is one of the lenders that have come under
greater scrutiny, Legan confirmed. The insurer's lawyers have
reviewed the litigation against the company, he explained, and a
major accounting firm conducted ``a very extensive review at the
operational level.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Legan declined to say what records had been examined for the
assessment, but said: ``We have not uncovered evidence that they
are engaged in predatory lending.''
</P>
<P>
   MBIA's review does not appear to have included interviews with
the lawyers or regulators suing First Alliance. Neither Canavan in
San Jose nor regulators in other states can recall any inquiry from
MBIA lawyers _ or anyone else on Wall Street _ about the strength
of the evidence against First Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   State regulators' investigations of the company have focused
thus far on its deceptive sales practices and have not yet examined
where and how its money was raised.
</P>
<P>
   Some legal theorists believe that Lehman and other banks that
finance the industry can be held accountable under the law passed
by Congress in 1994. It holds that a borrower's legal claims
against his or her original lender can also be asserted against any
subsequent purchasers of the loan. Some state laws may also provide
a weapon, according to experts who cite a well-established legal
principle in most states: those who knowingly finance illegal
behavior can be held liable for it.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ahearn said that Lehman says it has fulfilled its
legal responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   The current system ``is perfect for washing everybody's hands of
any responsibility,'' said Joshua Zinner, coordinator of a
foreclosure prevention project at South Brooklyn Legal Services.
``At each step, it gets harder and harder to hold anybody
accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   The subprime lenders trade group, meanwhile, is ``very, very
concerned'' about the ``few rogue lenders'' who give the industry a
bad name, said Zeltzer, the group's executive director. He
explained that the group's board has recently adopted an industry
code of ethics and voluntary standards that it hopes will prevent
deceptive or unfair lending practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not very happy headlines,'' Zeltzer said. ``This is
not how we want to do business.'' He added that Wall Street's
financing of the ``bad apples'' as well as the good ones did not
``make our job any easier.''

<P>
   Despite a decade of aggressive prevention efforts, heavy
drinking on college campuses did not diminish in the 1990s,
according to a study released Tuesday by the Harvard School of
Public Health. But attitudes toward alcohol among students have
become more polarized, with increases in abstainers and frequent
binge drinkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is disturbing that these findings show an increase in the
most extreme and high-risk form of drinking,'' said Henry Wechsler,
director of the College Alcohol Studies Program and the author of
the study. ``My disappointment is, given all the action on college
campuses to deal with this problem, and given the attention that
has been placed on it, the fact that it has stayed so remarkably
stable shows what a difficult problem it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey of more than 14,000 students at 119 colleges in 39
states found 22.7 percent were ``frequent binge drinkers,'' meaning
they had consumed at least five drinks in a row for men, or four
for women, at least three times in the two weeks before they had
filled out the questionnaire. That is up from 19.8 percent in 1993,
the first year of Wechsler's study, whose latest results appear in
this month's issue of the Journal of American College Health.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of occasional binge drinkers dropped from 24.7 in
1993 to 21.4 last year, the survey found, and the percentage of
non-binge drinkers _ students who had consumed alcohol in the past
year but had not recently binged _ fell from 40.1 to 36.6.
</P>
<P>
   Abstainers _ students who had not drunk at all in the past year
_ grew from 15.4 percent in 1993 to 19.2 percent in 1999. More
students were choosing to live in alcohol-free dormitories, the
survey found, and binge drinking dropped by almost 6 percent for
students living on campus, while it rose a similar amount for those
living off campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even at Florida State, the No. 1 party school in the nation,
the majority of students do not binge drink,'' said Ed McGlothlin,
20, an abstainer and a junior at FSU in Tallahassee. ``But you're
inundated by it. You have to go out of your way to avoid that kind
of culture.''
</P>
<P>
   More than three-quarters of the students surveyed said that they
had experienced the second-hand effects of binge drinking,
including being interrupted while studying or awakened (58
percent), having to take care of a drunken student (50 percent) or
being insulted or humiliated (29 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Wechsler examined the efforts that college administrators were
making to curtail binge drinking, finding that 97 percent of the
734 institutions surveyed had alcohol education programs in place.
Forty percent of the schools were working with groups in their
communities to address underage drinking, and one in four reported
regular meetings on the issue with neighborhood groups.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Yoast, director of a $10 million program financed by the
Robert Wood Johnson foundation to address binge drinking on 10
campuses across the country, said that the survey suggested that a
serious commitment and coordinated efforts could have an impact on
the problem. Though he was not allowed to release specific data
from the 10 schools, Yoast said the number of students who were
abstaining on those campuses had almost doubled since 1993, while
the rates of heavy drinkers were rising more slowly than that of
the national average.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every campus needs to address the whole environment in which
drinking occurs,'' Yoast said.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Sue Coleman, president of the University of Iowa, one of
the 10 campuses, said she has focused on the community's collective
responsibility for solving the problem, with initiatives ranging
from removing alcohol from her own pre-football game brunches to
urging local bar owners to buy scanners that highlight fake
identification cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, students who drink too much must be responsible for
the problems that they cause,'' she said. ``But students are not
responsible for manufacturing and marketing alcoholic beverages.
Students are not responsible for the excessive number of bars
within walking distance of our campuses. Students are not
responsible for the price specials that encourage drinking to get
drunk.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel Wiegert, 22, a senior economics major at the University of
Nebraska at Lincoln, said he had used a cost-benefit analysis to
determine that he should stop binge drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Having accidentally broken a table, wasted untold quantities of
money on beer and been rude to friends and strangers alike, Wiegert
said he had ``yet to come up with one benefit to high-risk
drinking.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton and Prime Minister Tony Blair of the United
Kingdom said Tuesday that the sequence of the human genome should
be made freely available to all researchers, leading to a sharp
selloff in the stocks of biotechnology companies that hope to
profit by creating drugs based on genetic data.
</P>
<P>
   The White House quickly said that it did not intend to hurt the
fledgling biotechnology industry, but investors who have made
biotechnology stocks the darlings of the market were unconvinced.
In frantic selling, they wiped away tens of billions of dollars in
market value from the industry. Genomics companies, which are
racing to produce a database of human DNA, were hit hardest, with
some off more than 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The drop was not confined to the biotechnology sector. After
briefly passing 5000 in morning trading, the Nasdaq composite
index, which is heavily weighted in technology stocks, fell
steadily. The index closed at 4706.63, down 200.61 points, its
second-largest point loss ever.
</P>
<P>
   For investors, the drop is noteworthy, because biotechnology and
Internet companies have led the stock market so far this year,
while most other stocks have languished. Despite falling almost 13
percent Tuesday, the Nasdaq biotech index remains up almost 30
percent this year, thanks to investors' belief that a new wave of
drug discovery and gene therapy is imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the rapid runup, the stocks are pricey by all
traditional valuations. The joint statement from Clinton and Blair,
which said that the genome data ``should be made freely available
to scientists everywhere,'' served as a spark for excitable
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Whitfield, chief executive of Incyte Pharmaceuticals, which
shed 28 percent of its market value during the day, said that
investors failed to distinguish between genome sequences and gene
sequences. The genome, referring to the total human DNA, has no
commercial value in itself and cannot be patented. The genes, which
occupy only 3 percent of the genome, can be. Researchers can work
on the sequences of patented genes in academic work and have to pay
license fees only if they wish to sell some invention based on the
sequence.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders' statement, which was eight months in the
making, is a bureaucratic outgrowth of the longstanding rivalry
between a public consortium of American and British academic
centers and Celera Corp. of Rockville, Md., to complete the
sequence of the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium, largely funded by the federal National
Institutes of Health and the Wellcome Trust of London, is posting
its findings daily on a Web site open to all. Celera promises to
make its version of the human genome freely available when it is
finished, probably this summer. Celera plans to patent some genes,
but its principal business plan is to operate a database of the
human and other genomes, charging fees for use of the programs that
search and analyze the genetic data.
</P>
<P>
   The statement was intended simply to codify the government
position in the rivalry _ that the human genome sequence should be
made publicly available to all researchers _ but appears to have
been interpreted as a challenge both to Celera's intellectual
property rights and to those of other genome and biotech companies.
</P>
<P>
   A White House official said neither challenge was intended,
noting that the statement explicitly endorsed intellectual property
protection for patents based on genes.
</P>
<P>
   The statement cuts across a complicated two-way rivalry between
the public consortium and Celera, and between Celera and its two
chief rivals, Incyte Pharmaceuticals and Human Genomes Sciences.
Both the consortium and Celera aim to sequence the human genome,
which means determining the order of the 3 billion chemical units
in the DNA, the genetic information possessed by each human cell.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy of Incyte and Human Genome Sciences is to focus on
the genes themselves, patenting as many as possible. The genes, the
programming instructions that operate the cell, are hidden in the
DNA, with no obvious signposts, and are hard to find even when the
genome sequence is known.
</P>
<P>
   The government statement adds to the tension between the public
consortium and Celera, which last week announced they had
effectively broken off merger negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Celera and its president, J. Craig Venter, have long been at
odds with the leading scientists of the public consortium, chiefly
Dr. John Sulston of the Sanger Center in Britain and Dr. Robert
Waterston of Washington University in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Before merger talks broke off, the public consortium proposed
that both sides abandon what it called ``the current antagonism and
excessive competition.''
</P>
<P>
   The initiative for the statement issued Tuesday is believed to
have come from the Wellcome Trust. Michael Dexter, Wellcome's
director, said the trust's concern was over the general ownership
of the genome, which in his view ``is mankind's and should not be
owned by any one company, individual or country.''
</P>
<P>
   Denying that the statement was aimed at any person or company,
he said the raw sequence _ the string of chemical units making up
the genome _ was not patentable and that the trust ``would fight
any patents based on sequence if they obstruct academic work and
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Venter, however, indicated that he thought Celera was a target
of the statement, but unfairly so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are puzzled by the statement and we think it represents the
lack of insight and the confusion that has been generated out
there. Our business is not in patenting the genome or tying it
up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Venter reiterated his previous position that Celera would make
available the sequence of the human genome when it was finished,
and said the onus was on rivals Incyte and Human Genome Sciences to
make their data public. ``I agree with the president and Tony Blair
that Incyte and HGS should publish their data,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Dexter and Rachel E. Levinson, a senior official at the
White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said the joint
statement acknowledged intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
   Levinson said nothing in the statement changed existing patent
law. She said she was ``very concerned and upset'' about the
reactions on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Neal Lane, the White House science adviser, said the
statement would not affect Celera because of Celera's known intent
to publish the human genome sequence, Levinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Haseltine said his company's data was being published through
the patent system. When a patent is issued, the underlying
invention is fully described.
</P>
<P>
   Haseltine said he agreed with Tuesday's statement because raw
genomic data ``has no practical use,'' an observation that he
termed ``the biggest untold secret of the human genome project.''
When researchers with the public consortium published the first DNA
sequence of a human chromosome in December last year, he said, ``No
new medical discoveries were made and no new genes were found.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason, he added, is that the computer programs for finding
genes are still far less efficient than the method pursued by his
company, one based on short DNA sequences called ``expressed
sequence tags,'' or ESTs.
</P>
<P>
   The EST approach exploits the fact that humans may not be able
to spot the genes in the genome but human cells surely can. They
regularly make transcripts of the genes whose information is needed
to synthesize the cell's various proteins. Researchers can capture
and analyze these transcripts, known as messenger RNAs, and from
just a small portion of their sequence can identify the
corresponding part of the gene from which they come. These little
snippets of genes, the ESTs, are the basis of gene-searching
approaches used by Human Genome Sciences and Incyte.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Patent and Trademark Office has issued some patents
based on ESTs alone, any such patents seem likely to be weaker than
patents based on the full-length genes.
</P>
<P>
   According to figures released by Human Genome Sciences, Incyte
leads in the human gene patent race with 353 U.S. patents issued,
followed by Human Genome Sciences (114 patents), SmithKline Beecham
(60), the US government (49), the University of California (46) and
Massachusetts General Hospital (45).
</P>
<P>
   There is still wide disagreement on the number of genes
contained in the human genome sequence. Both Dr. Randy Scott,
president of Incyte, and Haseltine estimate that there are 140,000
genes, double the number that Venter has favored.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the biotechnology companies have yet to prove their
ability to translate their research into revenues, much less
profits. Yet these stocks have helped drive the Nasdaq composite to
an 86 percent gain last year, the best performance by a major index
ever in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   By traditional valuation standards, the Nasdaq is
extraordinarily expensive, leaving some analysts worried that it is
overdue for a sharp drop. The average Nasdaq stock trades at well
over 100 times expected 2000 earnings, and some large Internet and
computer stocks trade at unheard-of price-earnings multiples of 500
or more.
</P>
<P>
   A drop in the biotech and computer high-fliers could shake the
broader stock market, which has already been rattled by the Federal
Reserve's recent increases in short-term interest rates, analysts
said. For the year, the Dow Jones industrial average is down more
than 14 percent, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index is off 7.5
percent, while the Nasdaq is up 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Cliggott, U.S. equities analyst at J.P. Morgan, called
the market ``very fragile'' because the stocks that are driving it
higher are already so expensive. ``We see the kinds of
price-earnings multiples that the Nasdaq's trading at as being
absolutely, positively unsustainable,'' said Cliggott, who turned
cautious in January.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, broader indexes followed the Nasdaq down. After
spending most of the day up, the S&AMP;P slipped 24.47 points to
1359.15, a 1.8 percent drop. The Dow industrials fell 135.89
points, or 1.4 percent, to 9811.24.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, analysts who have dared to be bearish have been
wrong for the last five years. Byron Wien, chief U.S. investment
strategist for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, noted that the Nasdaq is
very volatile and that investors might shrug off this decline as
simply a buying opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had bad days in the Nasdaq before, and they've snapped
right back,'' Wien said. ``What we have to see is whether the `buy
the dips' mentality is broken.''

HOUSE REPUBLICANS DROP CALL FOR ROLLBACK OF GASOLINE TAX  
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Texas, Miss., Pa., Okla.) (fb) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republicans backed away on Tuesday from their
call to repeal a 4.3-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax to lower the
skyrocketing prices at the pump and cool consumers' anger.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans have criticized the Clinton
administration as failing to address the soaring fuel costs. Sen.
Trent Lott, R-Miss., the Senate majority leader, has labeled the
levy the ``Gore tax'' because Vice President Al Gore cast a
tie-breaking vote in 1993 that raised the federal excise tax on
gasoline to 18.4 cents a gallon from 14.1.
</P>
<P>
   But an outcry from leading Republicans, road builders and
truckers has forced supporters of the repeal into a retreat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not get bogged down on only one dimension of the
problem, that is in itself a short-term dimension that offers scant
relief,'' Dick Armey, R-Texas, the House majority leader, told
reporters Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to all House members, the chairman of the House
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Bud Shuster, R-Pa.,
and three other top panel members warned that rescinding the tax
increase was ``the wrong way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Shuster, whose influence stems from his committee's power to
dole out lucrative road and bridge projects to colleagues'
districts, said the Transportation Department estimated that a
4.3-cent repeal would slash highway funding by $20.5 billion
through 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``An average of 420,000 high-paying jobs would be lost in each
of the years 2002 and 2003,'' Shuster said.
</P>
<P>
   If that were not chilling enough to Republicans eager to
maintain their tenuous control of the House this fall, other party
leaders voiced skepticism over the repeal's impact on consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it has any effect on fuel costs,'' said Rep.
J.C. Watts, R-Okla., a member of the House Republican leadership.
``Supply and demand is driving price right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders said they would shift the focus of their
attack to the administration's efforts to persuade domestic
refineries and oil-producing countries to increase production.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's look at the larger longterm problem of U.S. dependency
on foreign supplies, failed diplomatic relationships with critical
producing nations, and our own inability to fully develop our own
domestic resource,'' Armey said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a House Appropriations subcommittee would become
the latest congressional panel to grill Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson over the administration's multipronged efforts to bring
down fuel prices rising toward $2 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the majority whip, and Watts, were
planning a news conference at a Capitol Hill filling station to
castigate the administration's policies.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson pleaded his case on three network morning shows
Tuesday. ``We're moving ahead with getting refiners and gasoline
people and oil companies to get more gasoline out into the
market,'' the secretary said on ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
``We know people are hurting, but we're moving.''

PSKOV, Russia: by comparison.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whatever one may think of the conduct of the Chechen war, it was
hard to fault Tuesday's proceedings. By any definition, these men
were military heroes, Sokolov first among them.
</P>
<P>
   It was a small 2,500-foot-high ridge near the southern Chechnya
village of Urus-Kert that Company Six of Pskov's Regiment 104 took
Feb. 29, on orders to stop some 2,000 Chechen guerrillas from
escaping into neighboring Dagestan. By that afternoon they were
trapped in a fierce battle, with the nearest reinforcements more
than 5 miles away. Command of the force fell to Capt. Sokolov, who
had wanted to go to Chechnya last fall, during the bombings.
Instead, he shipped out from Pskov barely a month ago, just before
his 28th birthday on Feb. 16.
</P>
<P>
   At Urus-Kert, Sokolov organized the final defense of the
hilltop, aided by a few soldiers from a platoon that had broken
through rebel lines. At 11:30 p.m. that day, hundreds of guerrillas
began a nightlong attack against the defenders.
</P>
<P>
   Sokolov, by then wounded in the hand, rounded up six of his
company's newest members as the guerrillas drew close. He told them
to attempt a retreat, then radioed Russian forces and ordered
strikes on his own position in a last attempt to repel the
attackers.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen Russians died that night, including Sokolov. The rest
were killed as the battle raged on. The six men Sokolov ordered to
flee were the only survivors.
</P>
<P>
   In a private ceremony on Monday, two able-bodied survivors came
to the yellow stucco gymnasium of the 104th Regiment, where the
caskets lay in state. There they kneeled before Sokolov's bier and
thanked him for his sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after the funeral, a truck bearing his body arrived at a
small church in a run-down section of town, trailed by a bus
carrying family and friends. An honor guard unloaded the coffin. To
the beat of a snare drum and a trumpet, the soldiers carried
Sokolov past a broken iron gate and down a path of rutted frozen
mud strewn with spruce boughs.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four soldiers followed the coffin, and perhaps 75
mourners. Sokolov's mother buried her face in her husband's
shoulder, sobbing as she walked. Mrs. Sokolova, her head shrouded
in black lace, was silent.
</P>
<P>
   As they reached the newly dug grave, the soldiers lifted the
rust-colored cover from the coffin, revealing the Russian tricolor
and a small window above Sokolov's face. His father, Vladimir
Timofeyevich, fell upon it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forgive me for remaining alive,'' he cried, before being
lifted from the coffin and into a relative's arms.
</P>
<P>
   A camouflage-clad officer spoke over the coffin. ``They did
everything for Russia to survive,'' he said. ``We will do
everything so that the cause you struggled for will continue.''

UCLA LINEUP FINALLY AT FULL STRENGTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The UCLA men's basketball team will unleash its
most talented lineup when it opens NCAA Tournament play Thursday
against Ball State in the Minneapolis Metrodome.
</P>
<P>
   It features a rapidly improving junior point guard, Earl Watson;
two big men with NBA talent, Jerome Moiso and Dan Gadzuric; and two
McDonald's All-Americans on the wing, Jason Kapono and JaRon Rush.
</P>
<P>
   For size, talent and experience, it's probably UCLA's best
quintet since 1997, when Cameron Dollar, Toby Bailey, Charles
O'Bannon, J.R. Henderson and Jelani McCoy fueled a late-season
charge into the Elite Eight.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Rush's 24-game suspension, the Bruins have had few
opportunities to pair him with Kapono. Rush might not start against
Ball State - he hasn't started all season - but he'll be on the
court early and often.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a good chance you'll see quality minutes for Jason and
JaRon at the wings,'' Bruins coach Steve Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   Kapono, a 6-foot-7 freshman, is a dead-eye shooter (47.7 percent
from 3-point range) who can ease Watson's ballhandling load. Rush,
a 6-6 sophomore, scores from inside and outside and is a superb
rebounder (5.3 per game) for his size. Kapono can play guard on
offense (for ballhandling) and Rush can play guard on defense (for
quickness).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great combination,'' Watson said. ``I think it'll cause
matchup problems. Most (shooting) guards are my size (6-foot).''
</P>
<P>
   Getting his wind back: Rush didn't expect to be in top shape
after missing 24 games and a slew of practices because of his NCAA
suspension. But he didn't lose as much conditioning as he expected.
</P>
<P>
   He has averaged 20.6 minutes in three games and fatigued only
once - against Washington State - after several grueling practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'll be ready for the tournament,'' Rush said. ``I
just need to get a little more running in practice and get my reps
with the offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Dome doings: The Bruins closed the regular season with their
finest 3-point shooting in years, hitting 44.2 percent during the
six-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Can they keep it up? Perimeter shooting is critical to offense;
it expands defenses and gives Moiso and Gadzuric room inside.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be easy, not with tournament pressure, better
competition and the awkward shooting background in domes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a while to get used to it,'' Watson said.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Bernae Gunderson, a certified paralegal who lives in St. Paul,
is not intimidated by fine print. But she was still puzzled by the
mortgage documents she got in May 1998 from First Alliance Corp.
This did not sound like the affordable home equity loan that she
and her husband had been promised.
</P>
<P>
   So at about 2:30 p.m. on May 26, Gunderson called the manager of
the mortgage company's local office and asked all the right
questions about rates, monthly payments and fees. And she got
reassuring answers that confirmed her understanding of the terms of
her loan.
</P>
<P>
   But those comforting answers were mostly lies, as revealed in a
tape-recording Gunderson made of her conversation to play later for
her husband, Scott. In fact, $13,000 in fees were added to the
loan, and its interest rate was designed to rise a full percentage
point every six months. Facing mortgage payments already $150 a
month higher than when they first closed on the loan, the
Gundersons have been forced to work as much as 10 extra hours a
week to meet their payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have three children, and an extra $150 a month really can
help out for clothing and everything else,'' said Scott Gunderson
in a recent interview. ``It does make a lot of difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gunderson added, ``The stress is unbearable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gundersons are among scores of consumers who have complained
to state regulators about First Alliance, a national home-equity
lender based in Irvine, Calif. More than a dozen have already sued.
They all assert that the company has used a deceptive sales pitch,
delivered by loan officers recruited from big auto dealerships, to
lure homeowners into high-cost loans that expose them to the threat
of foreclosure and financial ruin.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which steadfastly denies wrongdoing, has also been
sued by the AARP and by regulators in California, Washington state,
Minnesota, Massachusetts and Illinois. Washington state is seeking
to suspend it from doing any business there. The company has
already stopped doing business in Minnesota. Florida is considering
legal action. A California appeals court concluded last year that
the company ``trained its employees to use various methods,
including deception, to sell its services.'' The U.S. Justice
Department is investigating First Alliance, and the company has
withdrawn from an industry trade association because of negative
publicity.
</P>
<P>
   But First Alliance still has some very important supporters: the
investment banks on Wall Street that help it raise the money lent
out to people like the Gundersons. Those banks began raising
significant amounts money for the company in the early 1990s, after
it had already come under investigation in California for
discriminatory lending. An investigation by The New York Times and
the ABC News program ``20/20'' shows they have pumped hundreds of
millions of dollars more into First Alliance in recent years, even
as civil lawsuits and state investigations have raised increasingly
troubling questions about First Alliance's business practices.
</P>
<P>
   The money raised by Wall Street for First Alliance and dozens of
similar companies has financed a quiet revolution in the financial
habits of millions of Americans whose low incomes or blemished
credit histories otherwise prevented them from obtaining
conventional loans. Such ``subprime'' borrowers, as they are called
in the lending industry, have turned in increasing numbers to
finance companies that cover the risk of default by charging them
significantly higher fees and interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1989, Wall Street investment banks have sold more than
$316.2 billion in bonds for subprime lenders _ more than twice the
dollar amount of the high-yield, or ``junk,'' bonds that companies
used to finance takeovers the 1980s. First Alliance has been a big
beneficiary of these new mortgage bonds, receiving nearly $2
billion the last decade, including $103 million raised through
Lehman Brothers just three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   William J. Ahearn, a spokesman for Lehman, said the firm's role
in selling bonds backed by subprime loans, known in the financial
world as underwriting, includes a careful review to make sure
investors have the facts they need. He said Lehman officials
believe that First Alliance had stepped up its efforts the last 18
months to prevent abuses. Lehman, he said, is an ``underwriter, not
a regulator.''
</P>
<P>
   For much of the last decade, the federal government has largely
left regulation of the industry to the states, despite a series of
congressional hearings that revealed rampant abuses. The first
round of hearings, in 1994, established that many companies were
taking advantage of unsophisticated homeowners _ many of them
members of minorities; the second round, in 1998, suggested that
the problems were spreading nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony did not dissuade Wall Street investment banks from
vastly expanding their stake in the industry. They have financed
lending operations, helped companies sell shares to the public and,
in some cases, even formed partnerships with the companies.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates contend that First Alliance, whose actions
have been extensively documented in court cases and regulatory
actions, is typical of an industry that often preys on low- and
middle-income people desperate to escape financial difficulties.
Industry officials say, however, that subprime lenders can provide
a valuable service to consumers whose credit records otherwise
disqualify them for conventional loans.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, First Alliance denies ``in the strongest terms''
that it has a companywide practice of deceiving borrowers and has
described some cases cited in regulatory documents as isolated
instances of misunderstandings involving a few loan officers. It
says it is providing a service to people who would otherwise be
unable to obtain credit, and insists that its fees _ which it says
are now lower, on average, than they once were _ are justified by
the dangers of lending money to the nation's riskiest borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``First Alliance's business model is to charge a higher
origination fee than most, offset by a lower interest rate than
most,'' explained Brian Chisick, the company's founder and chief
executive. That, he continued, gives consumers lower monthly
payments and lower total payments over the life of the loan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most borrowers are much more concerned about their monthly
payment than the amount of any fees,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Critics counter that, in fact, many First Alliance borrowers _
who regulators say are largely people with decent credit histories
_ wind up paying higher fees on top of higher interest rates than
are justified by the risks the lender is taking.
</P>
<P>
   While a few regulators have challenged its high fees, most of
the litigation currently pending against First Alliance focuses on
the elaborate script its loan officers have been trained to use.
The script, regulators say, is designed to deflect questions about
rates and fees, swamp borrowers under masses of needless detail and
foster a trusting atmosphere that would encourage customers to
lower their guard.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Gunderson was still wary enough to double-check her
loan with First Alliance, and to tape the call on her telephone
answering machine.
</P>
<P>
   Worried about the $13,000 in fees, she sought confirmation that
her loan was for about $47,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right, your amount financed is $46,172,'' the loan officer,
Brian Caffrey, assured her. ``That doesn't change.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right, right,'' she continued. ``And then the $13,000 goes on
top of that? And then interest is charged?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, no,'' he responded.
</P>
<P>
   But the answer should have been yes, yes, yes _ the fees were
added to the $46,172 that the Gundersons thought they had borrowed,
and they are paying interest on those fees over the life of the
loan.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Caffrey said in a recent interview that he was just following
the script First Alliance trained him to use _ an excuse strongly
disputed by Chisick, who said all company loan officers ``are
specifically trained to insure borrower understanding of all
aspects of their loan.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gunderson later shared her tape-recording with the
Minnesota attorney general's office, which attached a transcript of
it to court documents filed in its case against First Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything they told us made sense,'' she said, ``but they
were lying through their teeth. And they told all kinds of people
the same things that they told us. We just happened to be lucky
enough to push a button.''

   THE BUSINESS: Making Loans By the Script  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At age 60, Brian Chisick has the tanned, broad-shouldered good
looks of a native California surfer. But he was born in London,
where he lived until age 14, when his family moved to Vancouver,
British Columbia. In 1963, he relocated to Orange County, Calif.,
where after a briefly varied career _ he once sold office machines,
for example _ he found his way into the mortgage business.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, Chisick and his wife, Sarah, opened First Alliance
Mortgage Co., a consumer finance company that would ultimately rely
on two sources of strength: an aggressive sales force recruited
from auto dealerships and a ready access to Wall Street money.
</P>
<P>
   In its early days, his company was just one of many mom-and-pop
consumer finance companies that competed, with only middling
success, against stronger savings and loan institutions and
commercial banks. But before First Alliance was a decade old,
rocketing interest rates and financial deregulation had turned its
world upside down.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, in an effort to salvage the battered savings and loan
industry, Congress effectively repealed most state laws limiting
the interest rates that lenders could charge for first mortgages on
residential property. Two years later, Congress erased most state
restrictions on ``alternative'' loans, including adjustable-rate
mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   These steps, intended to help the savings and loan industry,
also benefited small consumer finance companies like Chisick's.
Over the next decade their share of the home-equity loan market
exploded, rising to 32 percent in 1989 from less than 0.5 percent
in 1977, according to a recent study by Cathy Lesser Mansfield, a
consumer law professor at Drake University in Des Moines.
</P>
<P>
   Chisick's company flourished in this new competitive
environment, and by 1988 he had opened lending offices in seven
communities across California. To staff them, he recruited highly
paid automobile salespeople, who were at ease with the ``hard
sell'' but tired of the long evening hours and weekend work that
auto sales involved.
</P>
<P>
   Recruits were required to commit to memory an elaborate 27-page
sales pitch _ known in the early days as ``The Loan Officer's Track
to Run On,'' later shortened to the Track.
</P>
<P>
   According to court documents filed in a 1988 case in California,
loan officers were drilled until they could deliver the sales
message flawlessly, slipping back into the script regardless of the
questions customers might raise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Establish a common bond,'' the loan officers were taught.
``Find this early in the conversation to make the customer lower
his guard.'' The script listed good bond-building topics (family,
jobs, children and pets) and emphasized, ``It's really important to
get them laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   It offered another bit of advice: ``To soften the blow of dollar
amounts, say: `merely,' `simply,' `only,' `as you know.'''
</P>
<P>
   And if the customer asks questions about the rate and the fees?
Just say, ``May I ignore your concern about the rate and costs if I
can show you that these are minor issues in a loan?''
</P>
<P>
   The company insisted that its employees stick to the script, and
managers monitored the loan officers over office intercom systems
to make sure they did, according to court documents and numerous
interviews with former employees.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, with testimony from several company whistle-blowers,
lawyers for the California Department of Corporations accused the
company of imposing harsher terms on loans made to homeowners in
neighborhoods with high minority populations _ areas that loan
officers referred to as ``never-never land,'' according to the
state's lawsuit. Regulators also complained that the company's
sales pitch deliberately obscured the high points and other fees
that borrowers paid.
</P>
<P>
   Chisick's lawyers denied racial discrimination and said the
``never-never land'' list had been prepared by some unknown
employee, had not been used for at least five years and had never
been sanctioned by First Alliance management. In April 1989, First
Alliance paid $420,000 to settle the state lawsuit, denying
wrongdoing but submitting to two years of state monitoring and
agreeing to conduct racial sensitivity training for its staff.
</P>
<P>
   Eight months later, a consumer class-action suit filed in
Oakland accused the company of fraudulently concealing its fees and
imposing excessive and unjustified charges on borrowers. In 1994,
again without acknowledging any liability, the company paid $6.85
million to settle the case.
</P>
<P>
   In its early days, First Alliance raised money for its
operations primarily by selling bundles of loans directly to
private investors. But in 1993, despite its earlier regulatory
trouble and the still-pending consumer lawsuit, it tapped into a
much deeper, less expensive source of fresh capital: Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of bonds backed by packages of lower-quality mortgage
loans was not a new idea, and some small deals had been done as
early as 1989. But by the mid-1990s, with professional investors
hungry for higher-yielding investments, major Wall Street
investment banks stepped up the volume of loan-backed bonds sold to
pension funds and other institutions. Suddenly, a vastly larger
pool of money became available to subprime lenders like First
Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The process works like this: Wall Street bankers invite
investors, typically large institutions like pensions funds and
universities, to buy certificates that pay an attractive interest
rate over many years. The money raised from those investors is then
used to buy groups of loans taken out by consumers through
companies like First Alliance. The borrowers' monthly payments
cover the interest paid to investors plus a profit to First
Alliance. The certificates are roughly equivalent to mutual fund
shares, with investors owning a portfolio of loans rather than
stocks or bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1994 and 1996, the amount of money raised on Wall Street
for subprime lenders rocketed. In 1996 nearly $40 billion worth of
subprime loan notes were sold, up from just over $10 billion the
year before; within two years, the annual volume was $87 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The business was attractive to Wall Street for two reasons.
First, investment banks collected fees for arranging the deals _
usually about a third of a penny for every dollar raised. Second,
doing the deals gave the investment bankers a steady supply of the
popular high-yielding mortgage notes to sell to their institutional
customers, who would otherwise shop elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   By 1996, most of the big investment banks on Wall Street, and
some large commercial banks, had plunged into the subprime
business; the resulting flood of cash was like a dose of steroids
for the industry.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   With Wall Street's demand in overdrive, ``lenders and mortgage
brokers went out and tried to make as many loans as they could to
meet the demand,'' explained Jeffrey Zeltzer, executive director of
the National Home Equity Mortgage Association, which represents
subprime lenders.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   First Alliance was one of the big beneficiaries of this
development. John D. Dewey, the consultant who advised the company
on its first Wall Street deals, recalled that its business grew
more than sixfold once it had access to mortgage market financing.
</P>
<P>
   First Alliance's profitability improved significantly as well,
since it was paying around 6 percent interest on the money it
raised on Wall Street and could lend that money to consumers at an
average interest rate of 14 percent, Dewey said.
</P>
<P>
   The company expanded, and today operates in more than a dozen
states from Washington to Florida. California remains its biggest
source of customers, but New York, New Jersey and Illinois are
close behind.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by the robust health that Wall Street's money had
generated, First Alliance was able to sell its own shares to public
investors in 1996, in a deal that allowed the Chisicks to draw $135
million out of the company.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While not politically active, they were generous with their new
wealth, contributing to a religious academy in Huntington Beach,
Calif., and building the Chisick Auditorium for the Jewish
Community Center of Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   The Chisicks' three sons, Jamie, Brad and Mark, have followed
their father into the subprime lending business, operating two
affiliated lending companies that have had their own troubles with
regulators in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   But life is not all mortgages and philanthropy for the Chisicks.
They are listed in property records as the owners of an expensive
condominium in Honolulu and a home in a gated community in Santa
Ana, Calif., which they bought after their successful public stock
offering in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The year the Chisicks finally grasped the brass ring of
extraordinary wealth was also the year that a number of elderly
First Alliance customers in the San Jose area began to worry about
losing the roofs over their heads.

<TEXT>
<P>
   First Alliance Corp., a nationwide home-equity lender that has
come under legal attack for deceptive practices, says it charges
high fees because its borrowers have less-than-perfect credit
records and are more likely to default on their loans.
</P>
<P>
   But the company, based in Irvine, Calif., tells a different tale
to Wall Street. In documents intended to attract investors, it
points out that more than three-fourths of its loans are made to
people with relatively good credit histories.
</P>
<P>
   A former loan officer said the company makes little effort to
distinguish between customers with poor records and those with good
credit history, who would qualify for conventional loans.
</P>
<P>
   At First Alliance, ``customers with `A' credit would pay the
same high loan fees as customers with `D' credit,'' according to a
sworn affidavit by Greg Walling, a First Alliance
loan-officer-turned-whistleblower who has cooperated with various
state regulators. His suburban Minneapolis office was a few dozen
yards from a conventional branch bank, he said in a recent
interview. ``I wanted to tell some of my better customers that
every step they took from my door to that bank would save them
$1,000 on their loan.''
</P>
<P>
   He was not exaggerating. Court record show that the company has
charged loan origination fees, called ``points,'' of 25 percent or
more on some loans, in addition to high interest rates and big
penalties for early repayment.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Chisick, the company's founder and chief executive, said
the company had recently reduced its origination fees to an average
of about 10 percent because of what he called the ``sound-bite
effect of the high origination fees.''
</P>
<P>
   Few conventional lenders charge origination fees of more than
two points on a loan _ that is 2 percent of the total amount _ and
many state regulators consider fees of more than eight points to be
indefensible.
</P>
<P>
   For someone borrowing $100,000 from First Alliance, a fee of 25
points adds $25,000 to the amount on which the customer is paying
interest.
</P>
<P>
   The calculation has become all too familiar to Velda Durney, one
of the homeowners who have sued First Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Durney's brother built her sage-green ranch house in Fremont,
Calif., outside San Jose, in the summer of 1966. It is filled with
evidence of a life well lived: photographs of happy school-age
grandchildren, fresh-baked carrot cakes cooling in the kitchen, a
bowling trophy-laden sideboard, pushed aside to make room for a
quilting frame.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband died soon after the house was finished, and she
raised her six children there alone, working for 23 years as a
sales clerk at Sears. She managed on a small pension and Social
Security _ until August 1996, when she refinanced her home through
First Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Durney believed she had signed for an 8.5 percent
adjustable-rate mortgage for $51,493 that would consolidate a few
credit card bills and lower her total monthly payments. In fact,
after more than 26 points in fees were added, her loan was for
$64,590, and its rate was scheduled to climb every six months until
her monthly payments would equal or exceed her original mortgage
payments.
</P>
<P>
   Her income simply would not stretch that far, and she began to
have nightmares that she would lose her home.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about that loan in an interview in January, the capable
Durney slumped into a kitchen chair, tears suddenly spilling from
behind her stylish wire-framed glasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't talk about it without crying,'' she apologized. ``It
took away every shred of self-confidence I had.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides her peace of mind, she has also lost her privacy. She
had to refinance again to get a fixed-rate mortgage, and her
monthly payments are still bigger than her pension income will
cover. So she makes ends meet, she said, by renting out her two
spare bedrooms _ which she had done as a favor to church
acquaintances in the past but now does with strangers, by
necessity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting by,'' she said last week, ``but just barely.''
</P>
<P>
   Chisick said he could not comment extensively on the case
because it was still in litigation, but he denied wrongdoing. He
added, ``All borrowers are given two separate, three-day periods to
reject the terms of the obligation. She decided not to.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed and Joanne Pagter, who lived in nearby Santa Clara, had their
own money worries as 1996 began. Mr. Pagter, then 67, ran a
part-time pool maintenance business that added about $800 a month
to the $735 he got from Social Security. But he was suffering from
severe kidney disease and was unsure how long he would be able to
work. Mrs. Pagter, who earned just over $2,100 a month, was nearing
retirement from her job at a corporate cafeteria service.
</P>
<P>
   They had abundant equity in their home, but their main financial
problem was an adjustable-rate mortgage that was scheduled to
increase Jan. 1 unless they could replace it with a loan that
required lower monthly payments.
</P>
<P>
   First Alliance, which had been calling them on a weekly basis
for several years, assured them that they could. So in January
1996, the couple visited the company's San Jose office.
</P>
<P>
   According to a lawsuit they later filed, the Pagters told
Jeffrey E.A. Phillips, a First Alliance loan officer, that their
goal was to keep payments as low as possible for the next year so
that they could save more, and then to sell their home after Mrs.
Pagter retired and buy a house near their daughter, who lives in
Lemoore, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The Pagters say they were rushed through the closing, signing
documents they were not given time to read. Not until October 1996,
when they were selling their Santa Clara home and trying to close
on their new one, did they discover the exact terms of their loan,
according to their lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   They had actually borrowed $170,264 from First Alliance _
including an origination fee of 13 points, or $19,950 _ not
$147,000 as they believed. This decreased the equity they had in
their old home, so they had to borrow more money, and quickly, to
close on the new house.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   THE COUNTERATTACK: Building a Case Against Deception
</P>
<P>
   Looking for help, the Pagters turned to Steinbock &AMP; Hofmann, a
three-person San Jose law firm that was already representing a
number of elderly homeowners with very similar complaints against
First Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The cases became the special passion of Sheila Canavan, the
firm's associate. Working on a shoestring _ and chided by friends
who saw parallels with the financially doomed lawyers in the movie
``A Civil Action'' _ the firm was representing five other
homeowners, all complaining of deceptive sales practices by First
Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, investigators in the state Department of
Financial Institutions in Olympia, Wash., had opened a file on
First Alliance, on the basis of 17 consumer complaints similar to
those made by Durney and the Pagters.
</P>
<P>
   State officials immediately focused on a 1996 version of the
Track, the sales script that the company's loan officers used in
their dealings with customers. In June 1997, in an affidavit filed
in state court, the lead investigator, Chuck Cross, observed that
First Alliance's intent ``appears to be to continually play down
the import of certain disclosures, misdirect crucial information or
confuse the borrower about what they are actually obtaining in the
transaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Cross was especially concerned that the script borrowed terms
from the federal disclosure documents, like ``amount financed,''
and gave them new and misleading definitions. Loan origination fees
were never called ``points,'' he said, but instead ``prepaid
finance charges,'' or ``minimum finance charges.'' And they were
labeled estimates when they were actually firm amounts.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators in other states sought copies of that 1996 sales
script, but First Alliance obtained a court order requiring
Washington regulators to keep the document secret _ an order that
remains in place today. (Last March, First Alliance notified the
state that it intended to sue Cross and his superiors for
defamation.)
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1997, Canavan and her partners in San Jose had
filed lawsuits against First Alliance on behalf of the Pagters,
Durney and four other area homeowners. The company mounted an
aggressive defense, insisting that all the terms on the loans had
been fully and clearly disclosed. Company lawyers pointed out that
by signing closing statements, borrowers had attested to fully
understanding the terms of their loans.
</P>
<P>
   Several borrowers in the lawsuit said they had signed the forms
in a rush, without having had time to examine them carefully.
Others said they had been advised to ignore information in the
forms that differed from what they had been told by a loan officer.
Still others said they had been assured that the information was in
error and would be corrected, or depicted a worst-case scenario
that was unlikely to arise.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Pagter case in San Jose began to inch toward
trial. The company tried to shunt the case off to arbitration, but
a state appeals court, in a crucial ruling, concluded that the
elderly couple's signature on a form agreeing to forgo lawsuits had
been `` obtained by fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   In the decision, the court sharply criticized First Alliance,
which it said had ``trained its employees to use various methods,
including deception, to sell its services.''
</P>
<P>
   In his written response, Chisick called the ruling ``incorrect''
and ``a blatant error.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, in February 1999, gave the Pagters hope, but
settlement discussions with First Alliance dragged through 1999 and
broke off inconclusively early this year. It was not until a day
after a jury had been chosen for a January trial in San Jose that
First Alliance agreed to pay an undisclosed sum to settle the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed and I used to joke that they were just waiting for us all
to die,'' said Mrs. Pagter. The joke was prophetic. Ed Pagter died
last October.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why First Alliance had delayed a settlement for so long,
given Mr. Pagter's ill health, Chisick said, ``Mr. Pagter was ill
when he borrowed the money, so the advancement of his illness was
not a factor.''
</P>
<P>
   GROWING OPPOSITION: Picking Up Allies With Influence  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even an attentive Wall Street investment banker might have
missed the early local headlines critical of First Alliance. But
the company's legal troubles attracted national attention in May
1998, when the Pagters and their fellow plaintiffs gained a
powerful new ally in their fight: the giant AARP.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Constantine Davis, a staff lawyer, said the AARP had been
approached by Canavan's firm and ``decided this was definitely
something we wanted to look into.''
</P>
<P>
   The organization was taking advantage of an unusual facet of
California's business laws, called Section 17200, that allows a
plaintiff to sue as a ``private attorney general,'' seeking
restitution on behalf of all citizens affected by certain deceptive
business practices.
</P>
<P>
   State regulators, too, were heading to court. By the end of
1998, Minnesota Attorney General Hubert H. Humphrey III had sued
First Alliance, accusing it of deceptive sales practices. In
Massachusetts, an assistant attorney general, Pamela S. Kogut, had
obtained a temporary injunction forcing the company to limit its
origination fees to eight points _ although a top company executive
had argued in court that the company could not make a profit with
fees that low. And in Illinois, Attorney General Jim Ryan was suing
as well, seeking remedies that included the rescission of all the
loans First Alliance has made there.
</P>
<P>
   Steve LeClair, an assistant attorney general in Florida, says
that his staff has subpoenaed a ``very large volume of records''
and is talking with First Alliance ``to see if this is something we
can resolve without filing a formal complaint.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida's primary concern is the origination fees. ``They're
just so excessively high that it's hard for me to conceive of any
way a consumer would agree to that kind of loan if all the facts
have been put before them,'' LeClair said.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, after years of legal fencing with First Alliance,
Washington state regulators finally filed a formal complaint
against the company, seeking to suspend its license for two years
and to obtain an order that it discontinue deceptive practices.
</P>
<P>
   And in September, First Alliance agreed to settle the consumer
protection lawsuits filed against it in Minnesota. While
acknowledging no wrongdoing, the company agreed to offer each of
its Minnesota customers $4,000 to $6,000 and to read any new
customers a simple court-ordered description of its fees and rates
before any loan discussions began.
</P>
<P>
   Prentiss Cox, a Minnesota assistant attorney general, said the
company no longer did business in his state. ``That kind of relief
suggests the strength of our allegations in the case.''
</P>
<P>
   But at best, regulatory efforts like Minnesota's can only
protect a statewide segment of consumers; companies can
short-circuit such investigations simply by pulling out of one
state and moving into another. Some states have strong, clear
consumer lending laws and well-financed regulatory agencies _ but
others do not.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The early waves of scandal from the subprime industry a decade
ago prompted Congress in 1994 to adopt legislation requiring
greater disclosure by high-cost lenders, but federal action to
enforce those laws has been rare. Indeed, the Federal Trade
Commission filed the first disciplinary cases under the 1994 law
just last summer.
</P>
<P>
   And yet none of these legal problems seems to shake Wall
Street's faith in First Alliance or most of the other large
subprime lenders that have been the targets of consumer advocates'
complaints. To be sure, the high-yield mortgage market grew a bit
jittery in late 1998, after revelations of some subprime lenders'
questionable accounting practices. But last year, there were more
than 200 separate deals totaling more than $75 billion _ less than
in 1998 but more than in any other previous year.
</P>
<P>
   THE WALL STREETERS: Raising Money In the Best Circles  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No Wall Street investment bank had a bigger share of that
reviving 1999 market than Lehman Brothers, Wall Street's
fourth-largest brokerage house and one of its oldest and most
prestigious names.
</P>
<P>
   First Alliance's initial public offering in 1996 was handled by
Friedman Billings &AMP; Ramsey, a small investment bank based in
Arlington, Va. But through the late 1990s, First Alliance had
raised money through a variety of bigger banks and brokerage
houses, including Prudential Securities. Then about two years ago,
as the AARP lawsuit was added to First Alliance's legal troubles,
Lehman Brothers became the company's primary source of financing.
In all, it has handled eight separate deals for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman Brothers has not only helped raise money for First
Alliance despite its mounting legal troubles but, more recently,
has taken a small investment stake in the firm.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ahearn, the Lehman spokesman, pointed out that the brokerage
house's deals for First Alliance ``have been relatively small''
compared with Lehman's deals for other companies. And he emphasized
that all of First Alliance's mounting legal troubles were carefully
reviewed by Lehman and fully disclosed to investors who bought the
notes backed by First Alliance mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Nor did First Alliance's legal difficulties dissuade another
important Wall Street supporter: MBIA Insurance, the giant
financial insurance company, which has stood behind many of First
Alliance's loan deals over the years, guaranteeing that principal
and interest will be paid to investors promptly. With MBIA's
backing, First Alliance's mortgage-backed notes were awarded Wall
Street's highest credit ratings, making them more attractive to
institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Legan, a managing director of MBIA, said that his company
became increasingly concerned last year about the problem of
predatory lending in the subprime market and that it had recently
expanded the scope of its review of each subprime deal it agreed to
insure.
</P>
<P>
   First Alliance is one of the lenders that have come under
greater scrutiny, Legan confirmed. The insurer's lawyers have
reviewed the litigation against the company, he explained, and a
major accounting firm conducted ``a very extensive review at the
operational level.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Legan declined to say what records had been examined for the
assessment, but said: ``We have not uncovered evidence that they
are engaged in predatory lending.''
</P>
<P>
   MBIA's review does not appear to have included interviews with
the lawyers or regulators suing First Alliance. Neither Canavan in
San Jose nor regulators in other states can recall any inquiry from
MBIA lawyers _ or anyone else on Wall Street _ about the strength
of the evidence against First Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   State regulators' investigations of the company have focused
thus far on its deceptive sales practices and have not yet examined
where and how its money was raised.
</P>
<P>
   Some legal theorists believe that Lehman and other banks that
finance the industry can be held accountable under the law passed
by Congress in 1994. It holds that a borrower's legal claims
against his or her original lender can also be asserted against any
subsequent purchasers of the loan. Some state laws may also provide
a weapon, according to experts who cite a well-established legal
principle in most states: those who knowingly finance illegal
behavior can be held liable for it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ahearn said that Lehman says it has fulfilled its
legal responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   The current system ``is perfect for washing everybody's hands of
any responsibility,'' said Joshua Zinner, coordinator of a
foreclosure prevention project at South Brooklyn Legal Services.
``At each step, it gets harder and harder to hold anybody
accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   The subprime lenders trade group, meanwhile, is ``very, very
concerned'' about the ``few rogue lenders'' who give the industry a
bad name, said Zeltzer, the group's executive director. He
explained that the group's board has recently adopted an industry
code of ethics and voluntary standards that it hopes will prevent
deceptive or unfair lending practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not very happy headlines,'' Zeltzer said. ``This is
not how we want to do business.'' He added that Wall Street's
financing of the ``bad apples'' as well as the good ones did not
``make our job any easier.''

JUDGE RULES SCHOOL VOUCHERS VIOLATE FLORIDA'S CONSTITUTION 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   A Florida judge ruled Tuesday that the state's constitution
barred students from using taxpayer money for private school
tuition, blocking Florida's eight-month-old voucher program, the
nation's boldest experiment in using market forces to improve
failing schools.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, which the state said it would appeal, is the
second major legal setback for voucher proponents in recent months,
following a federal judge's ruling that Cleveland's program
contravenes the First Amendment's separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's is the first statewide voucher program and the first
anywhere to tie voucher eligibility to schools' performance on
standardized tests. It serves as a model for a national voucher
plan proposed by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the expected
Republican presidential nominee, and has been copied by several of
the 25 state legislatures currently considering new voucher
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ruling puts a stake in the heart of the voucher
movement,'' said Bob Chase, president of the National Education
Association, the teachers' union whose Florida affiliate was
involved with the lawsuit challenging vouchers. ``It sends a strong
signal to states across the nation that vouchers are no substitute
for a quality public education.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the ruling, the 53 children in Pensacola, Fla., who are
currently using vouchers to attend private schools will be allowed
to finish out the semester, but the state will not pay their
tuition next year. The ruling also stops the program's expansion to
as many as 60,000 students in 78 schools who would have become
eligible for vouchers in June if their schools were graded ``F''
for the second time in four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tragedy because this beacon of hope that has been
offered to parents as a way for their children to get a better
education has, at least temporarily, been snuffed out,'' said John
F. Kirtley, a Tampa venture capitalist who is on the board of
Floridians for School Choice, a pro-voucher group.
</P>
<P>
   Kirtley and Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, the architect of the
program, vowed to raise private donations to allow the Pensacola
students using the vouchers to stay in the private schools, where
their parents say they are thriving.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about children _ it's not about the system, it's not
about adults,'' said Bush, the brother of the presidential
candidate, in an afternoon news conference at the Statehouse in
Tallahassee. ``I'm personally not going to let parents who have
been given the assurance that their children can go to another
school _ I'm not going to force them back to schools they don't
want to go to.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling by Judge L. Ralph Smith Jr. of the Circuit Court of
Florida focuses on a provision of the Florida constitution that
declares education a ``fundamental value'' of the state and says it
is a ``paramount duty'' to provide a ``uniform, efficient, safe,
secure and high quality system of free public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   The constitutional obligation to provide education, in Article
IX, Section I, has existed for more than a century, but the
specifics about how it should be provided were added by voters in
November 1998 _ the same year Jeb Bush was elected governor on a
platform that emphasized school accountability and school choice.
</P>
<P>
   In defending against the lawsuit filed by groups of parents and
teachers, voucher proponents argued that since the state already
spent millions of dollars a year sending disabled and other
students with special needs to private schools, it could also do so
to help students escape low-performing schools.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith said that because the voucher program used private
schools to provide the same services offered by public ones, it
``supplants the system of free public schools mandated by the
constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   While the ruling may be a catastrophic blow to Florida's
program, its impact nationally is limited, since it turns on a
narrow provision of the State Constitution. Virtually every state
constitution has such a provision outlining the state's
responsibility to provide public education, but judges in each
state may interpret the language differently.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The broader question is whether vouchers, which are typically
used at parochial schools, violate the federal Constitution's
separation of church and state. Cleveland's voucher program,
involving about 3,500 students, was declared illegal on those
grounds in December, a decision that has been appealed and is
expected to soon land before the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's ruling is likely to be appealed directly to the state
Supreme Court in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a blip in the voucher movement,'' said Clint Bolick, a
lawyer for the Institute for Justice, a conservative group based in
Washington that helped defend the lawsuit. ``There has not been a
single lawsuit yet where we have not had at least a momentary
setback. We have developed some serious stamina. At the end of the
day, we have not lost a single voucher program.''
</P>
<P>
   Vouchers were first proposed by the economist Milton Friedman in
1955, and are one of the most contentious issues in education and
political circles today, a crucial point of disagreement between
the likely Democratic and Republican presidential nominees. More
than 25 state legislatures have voucher bills pending, and many
major cities, including New York, are wrestling with the question
of whether vouchers are a threat to the public school system or its
savior.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida decision is the latest in a string of legal
victories for voucher opponents, a coalition of teachers' unions
and civil liberties groups that have won court challenges against
small programs in Maine, Pennsylvania and Vermont as well as Ohio.
Milwaukee's voucher program, the nation's oldest and largest, with
8,000 low-income students enrolled this year, has been upheld by
Wisconsin's highest court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future will really very much be determined by what the
U.S. Supreme Court does when it gets the question,'' said Joseph P.
Viteritti, a professor at New York University who just wrote a book
on school choice. ``If the court says it's against the
Constitution, these things can't really move. On the other hand, if
the court did approve it, it doesn't necessarily mean you're going
to have 50 states with voucher laws, either. The politics of many
states are not friendly to vouchers.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Florida's was the first statewide voucher program and was
likely to have become the nation's largest when school grades are
released in June, it was confined this year to two schools in the
most impoverished neighborhoods of Pensacola because they were the
only ones with failing scores on standardized tests two years
running.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Gallagher, the state's education commissioner, said he would
continue to grade schools as planned this spring, and that students
in schools with repeated F's would still be allowed to transfer to
public schools with grades of C or higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still expecting the schools to fix the F's and D's,''
Gallagher said. ``We are continuing with accountability. We want to
see the F schools eliminated in the State of Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   Andy Cameron, whose son, Ray, is using a voucher, described
himself as ``not a happy camper'' in the hours after the decision,
and said that while he would like to keep Ray in Catholic school,
``I can't afford it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be forced to have Ray back in that environment
again,'' said Cameron, a heating, ventilation and air-conditioning
repairman. ``I have no control over it. I have no control because
of the economic circumstances I labor under. If I had a better job,
I wouldn't care about the voucher program.''
</P>
<P>
   (STORY ENDS HERE. OPTIONAL SIDEBAR FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   WHAT THE FLORIDA CONSTITUTION SAYS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Following is Article IX, Section 1 of the Florida constitution,
which was cited as the reason for a judge's decision Tuesday that
the state's school voucher program is illegal. The provision has
been on the books for more than a century although it was amended
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The education of children is a fundamental value of the people
of the State of Florida. It is, therefore, a paramount duty of the
state to make adequate provision for the education of all children
residing within its borders. Adequate provision shall be made by
law for a uniform, efficient, safe, secure and high quality system
of free public schools that allows students to obtain a high
quality education and for the establishment, maintenance and
operation of institutions of higher learning and other public
education programs that the needs of the people may require.''

A DANCING JUGGLER WHOSE ACT PLAYS TAG WITH GRAVITY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 19) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 Matthew Gurewitsch writes about the arts for The Wall Street
Journal and other publications.  
 By MATTHEW GUREWITSCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The music hall and the circus are not the places devotees of
dance hang out looking for revelations, which as a rule probably
saves them disappointment, but every so often a revelation comes
along.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point: the 29-year-old Ukrainian juggler Viktor Kee
(born Kiktev), currently in San Francisco through next Sunday with
Cirque du Soleil's extravaganza, ``Dralion.'' (The show moves to
San Jose on April 6 and to Denver on June 6.)
</P>
<P>
   His act involves seven solid plastic balls, hand-molded by the
artist himself, which he not only sends flying in arcs that amaze
the eye but somehow also catches _ no hands _ on a shoulder, on a
knee, on the back of his neck. At one point, planted on his knees,
he lines up five balls straight down his undulating spine.
</P>
<P>
   If the balls stuck in place, you would suspect Velcro or maybe
magnets, but no. Kee releases them back to the pull of gravity, and
they roll off to swirl once more. At the same time, he dances a
solo, both sinuous and angular, that climbs steadily to the
ecstatic. Somewhere on his family tree there must be a serpent,
maybe the one that tempted Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Kee worked the moves out with the help of his former wife,
Galina, a jazz dancer with an act of her own involving swinging
bowling pins. Currently she is appearing at the Moulin Rouge in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   A reviewer who caught Kee in a gala of gastronomy and variete
called ``Pomp, Duck and Circumstance,'' which played New York and
Atlanta a while back, was moved to wonder in print, ``What if
Diaghilev had choreographed for a juggler?'' _ momentarily
forgetting that the founding impresario of the Ballets Russes hired
choreographers rather than making dances himself.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the question conjured up the right associations, if
Nijinsky had been a juggler.
</P>
<P>
   Built on the lines of an Art Deco diver, he stands 5 feet 10
inches and weighs 155 pounds, with no waist to speak of (his jeans
are size 28) but broad, square shoulders and robust thighs to
match. He warms up for each show with two hours of practice and
gymnastics. Asked what is hardest about his act, he knocks off a
list: ``Concentration. Cardiovascular fitness. Being able to juggle
while doing the choreography.''
</P>
<P>
   What is the worst thing that can happen? ``The timing can go
wrong,'' he says. ``The tricks are timed to the music. If you lose
your timing, it's hard to get back. You can't be tense. If you're
tense, you can't juggle.''
</P>
<P>
   His fresh, open face and easy smile in the arena reflect no
tension at all. Juggling seven balls looks like the easiest thing
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Like Nijinsky, the self-styled clown of God, Kee radiates
something spiritual; bravura, in the end, is not the message. In
earlier versions of his solo, he began by hatching from a
transparent egg. In ``Dralion,'' he springs from within a
spiderlike monstrosity, but the meaning is the same. ``I jump
out,'' Kee explains simply. ``I'm naked, afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   Not literally naked, although the effect of the costume he
designed for ``Dralion,'' flesh-colored with a few splashes of
color, is purposely more revealing than the flashy finery he has
worn at pleasure domes like the Moulin Rouge and the Lido in Paris
and the Friedrichstadt Palast in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had many costumes,'' he recalls. ``One was a Versace tricot.
It had a beautiful line. But wearing something like that, you
represent a character, not yourself. I want to be nice, not just
show a nice costume.'' What matters for Kee's act of discovery is
the sense of awakening life.
</P>
<P>
   His first prop is a heart he produces mysteriously from inside
his almost invisible costume. An aerial sprite appears high in the
tent, discovers him, glides low for a closer encounter, receives
the heart and ascends. From the heights, she drops a white ball,
which Kee catches.
</P>
<P>
   At once, things start to change. ``I think, `Maybe this thing
belongs to me,''' Kee explains. ``I start to play.'' Another white
ball drops, and another and another, a half dozen in all. From
poised but tentative beginnings, the juggling gains greater and
greater virtuosity.
</P>
<P>
   The last of the seven balls is red, like the heart. From a final
explosion that scatters balls every which way, Kee magically picks
the red one, which he tosses to the airborne spirit: the gift of
his art sealing the prior gift of his heart.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the typical dancer, whose body is the instrument for many
dances, Kee encapsulates all he has to say in a single seven-minute
number. It makes him a nice living, but has taken him far from his
roots. While working in Paris, he found an apartment near the Pont
Alexandre III, a showpiece of czarist gilt and ornament that Russia
built as a gift to France.
</P>
<P>
   It was a nostalgic reminder of home. Occasionally, Kee branches
out. Once, he slogged through a blizzard-locked Manhattan to juggle
telephones behind James Earl Jones in a commercial for Bell South.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like two pages of biography,'' Kee remarks. ``Who
cares?'' The immediate subject is his Web site, www.viktorkee.com,
which skims lightly indeed over his history, personal and
professional: he first performed at 6 in Ukraine, trained at the
Professional Circus School in Kiev, scored a special prize at the
Cirque de Demain festival in Paris in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt the gallery of color photographs at the site attracts
closer scrutiny. Subdivided into ``artistic,'' ``posters'' and
``show'' sections, it gives heavy play to glitz, skin and muscle.
One magic image in ``show'' catches Kee tossing seven balls, like
the seven stars of the Big Dipper.
</P>
<P>
   More magical by leagues, though, is the blurry black-and-white
snap Kee saves for last in the ``backstage'' area (arrived at from
the home page via the icon marked ``fun'').
</P>
<P>
   Shot at a rehearsal in Ukraine, with the artist in practice
clothes, it goes beyond the controlled environment of performance
into the realm of pure quest. Just for the divinity of the thing,
Kee is floating a zigzag constellation not of seven balls but of
nine.

WRECK KILLS 1 ON RICE DEBATE TEAM

   HOUSTON _ A member of Rice University's forensics team was
killed and five other students and two coaches injured when a
minivan carrying squad members back from a competition in Omaha,
Neb., was rear-ended late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The crash is the third this year involving Texas college
students traveling to competitive events.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Shepard, vice president of public affairs for Rice, said
Monday's accident could have been more tragic had Rice officials
not reviewed and tightened student travel policies in the wake of
the earlier crashes.
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred at 10:35 p.m. CST on Interstate 45 in
north Houston, said Harris County sheriff's deputies.
</P>
<P>
   Two vans carrying 11 Rice students and three coaches were
southbound when construction that reduced the southbound freeway to
one lane caused both vehicles to slow to a stop, deputies said.
</P>
<P>
   A Ford F-250 pickup pulling a trailer loaded with heavy
equipment was unable to stop, and it slammed into the back of one
van, driving it into the back of the van in front, said officials.
</P>
<P>
   Dead at the scene was 18-year-old Daniel Henning of Vernon
Hills, Ill. Henning was a passenger in the rear van, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Austin, Texas, Henning was a freshman attending the
university's Baker College, Shepard said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, when the Rice debate team won the national Pi Delta
Kappa forensics competition in St. Louis, Shepard said one of nine
individual championships the team received went to Henning, in the
``Student Congress'' competition.
</P>
<P>
   The team was returning from a national competition in Omaha over
the weekend, Shepard said.
</P>
<P>
   Two other students, both passengers in the same van as Henning,
were taken to Memorial Hermann Hospital by Life Flight helicopter,
One had a broken leg, the other was being checked for possible
internal injuries. Both were listed in fair condition.
</P>
<P>
   Two coaches and three other students were taken to Memorial
Hospital Northwest and treated for less serious injuries. All had
been released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 43-year-old driver of the pickup was not seriously injured.
Authorities said the driver could be charged.
</P>
<P>
   In January, three music students from the University of North
Texas were killed when a van traveling the wrong way on I-20 near
Gordon slammed into their car as they drove to a weekend
performance with the Abilene Philharmonic Orchestra. The driver of
the van also died in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, four members of the Prairie View A&AMP;M track team died
and several were injured on their way to a track meet in Pine
Bluff, Ark., when their van veered off a northeast Texas road and
rolled, ejecting several of its 15 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The Feb. 10 Prairie View wreck caused Rice officials to review
travel policies, Shepard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that was reflected in the fact that we had older
drivers, and everyone was wearing seat belts,'' Shepard said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Rice minivans were being driven by a coach and a senior
student when the accident occurred, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alas, there are some accidents that cannot be prevented by
being careful,'' Shepard said. ``This was one of those.''

GIULIANI SETS UP `SOFT MONEY' CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has set up a new political
committee to collect the largely unregulated donations known as
soft money, and is asking supporters of his Senate bid to give as
much as $50,000 per couple to attend the committee's inaugural
dinner next week.
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raising arm, called the Giuliani Victory Committee,
allows Giuliani to skirt the strict federal rules governing
donations to his separate Senate campaign committee _ a practice
already embraced by his Democratic opponent, Hillary Rodham
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   With both candidates now harvesting soft money from wealthy
benefactors, the Senate race is likely to become a textbook example
of how such contributions have rendered the Watergate-era system of
limits increasingly ineffective. Soft money is supposed to be used
for party activities, not specific candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The official Senate committees run by candidates can receive a
maximum of $2,000 per person and cannot accept corporate
contributions. Soft money committees, which are supervised by
political parties, are bound by no such restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Giuliani Victory Committee CAN accept donations from BOTH
personal AND corporate accounts without limit,'' states the
invitation to the Giuliani fund-raising dinner, which is to be held
on March 23 at Cello, a three-star restaurant in an Upper East Side
town house.
</P>
<P>
   The invitation says that donors who pay $50,000 a couple receive
tickets to a reception, dinner and after-dinner drinks with the
mayor. The reception and dinner alone is $20,000 a couple, while it
costs $5,000 per person to attend just the reception.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton established a soft money committee last fall, and it has
collected more than $700,000, including individual donations up to
$80,000. Giuliani has upbraided her for accepting the money,
striving to link her to the fund-raising investigations of the
Clinton administration, but said at the time that he would not rule
out creating a similar committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a long time ago that you don't tie one hand behind
your back,'' Giuliani said in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe you have to be competitive,'' he added. ``I intend
to get my message out. I intend to have enough money to do that,
and the other campaign has already started using soft money big
time, without any penalty, without any stopping of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The new Giuliani committee marks the latest escalation in fund
raising for what is expected to be the most expensive Senate race
ever. Giuliani and Clinton have already broken the record for fund
raising in the year before a Senate contest, with Giuliani taking
in $12 million for his official Senate committee and Clinton
collecting $8 million for hers.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton's soft money account is relatively small, and
Giuliani's is nascent, both are expected to become more important
nearer Election Day, when the two camps will be pouring money into
television advertisements and seeking ways of raising large sums
quickly in what is expected to be a tight race.
</P>
<P>
   In response to questions about the new committee, Bruce J.
Teitelbaum, the mayor's campaign manager, released a statement:
``Given the enormous amounts of unethical fund raising the Justice
Department has allowed the Clintons to do, it's necessary for
candidates to do this to achieve a level playing field, with this
perfectly legal form of fund raising.''
</P>
<P>
   In the invitation to the fund-raising dinner, Teitelbaum wrote,
``We must overcome the tens of millions of dollars the Democratic
Party, the big Labor Unions and the left-wing special interests
will spend on her behalf.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, political parties are barred from spending soft
money on efforts to aid specific candidates, and can use it only
for items like voter drives or so-called issue advertisements,
which spotlight a contender's views but do not urge people to vote
in a particular way.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, the line between soft and hard money has become more
and more blurred, and federal regulators have been reluctant to
crack down on the use of soft money to help candidates, which is
why some politicians and advocacy groups have called for soft money
to be abolished.
</P>
<P>
   The leading champion of such a measure is Sen. John McCain,
R--Ariz., who made a soft money ban a pillar of his failed
presidential campaign. Vice President Al Gore, the presumptive
Democratic nominee, said last Saturday that he would also focus on
a soft money ban; his Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, says he favors a ban on soft money donations by corporations
and unions, but not by individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani and Clinton both support a complete ban, and their
aides engaged in fruitless talks in January on ways of curbing soft
money in the campaign. Each side accused the other of gamesmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani set up the new committee, which will also collect
so-called hard dollars that can be used to help Giuliani directly,
in conjunction with the National Republican Senatorial Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Roy, communications director for the senatorial
committee, declined to estimate how much would be collected at the
fund-raising dinner. He defended the establishment of the new
committee, noting that under the law, the committee could not tell
donors that the soft money would be used in New York, so it should
not be seen as an attempt to get around the donation limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not earmark the contributions for a specific race,'' Roy
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that similar joint fund-raising committees had also been
created for the party's candidates in Missouri, Pennsylvania and
Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   While the senatorial committee will control the soft money and
cannot legally promise that it will be used in New York, in
practice it is understood that the money will make its way back to
the state in the form of advertisements bought by the senatorial
committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``This joint fund-raising committee will be helpful to our
campaign effort and the NRSC's efforts nationwide,'' the invitation
to the March 23rd event states.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in Albany on Tuesday, Clinton defended her recent
attendance at a fund-raiser for her Senate campaign sponsored by a
group of Pakistani-Americans who wanted the president to visit
Pakistan on his trip to South Asia, which begins on Saturday. The
February event raised $50,000. Last week, Clinton said he would
make a brief stop in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told reporters that the fund-raiser had nothing to do
with the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president made his decision based on what he thought was
best for our country,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   She declined to say whether she spoke with the president about
the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anybody thinks they can influence the president by making
contributions to me, they're dead wrong,'' she said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a sobering assessment of the deteriorating
situation in Kosovo, a senior Pentagon official said Tuesday that
the NATO-led peacekeeping operation, which includes American
troops, had reached a ``decisive moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The official, who just returned from a visit to the American
sector in Kosovo, did not say that more American troops would be
sent to Kosovo. But the situation is so precarious that ``we're at
ground zero,'' even though NATO-led troops have been in Kosovo
since June, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   By this, the official meant that the United Nations effort to
restart civilian life was so weak in Kosovo that the American
troops were still involved in chores that should be done by the
police and the courts.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, an insurgency outside Kosovo's border in
southern Serbia had sprung up, causing new problems. The official
described a situation in which troops could not keep the peace
between Serbs and Albanians within Kosovo and at the same time seal
Kosovo's borders, as the commander of the NATO-led troops there,
Gen. Klaus Reinhardt, has suggested.
</P>
<P>
   In order to seal just the rugged 125-mile border of Kosovo that
the American troops are in charge of, ``two to three times'' more
troops would be required, the official said. About 6,000 American
troops are now stationed in Kosovo, all based in the eastern part
of the territory.
</P>
<P>
   To get a better handle on what was happening in the Presevo
Valley, just over Kosovo's border in southern Serbia, the official
said the Pentagon was planning to send unmanned aerial vehicles,
known as drones, for surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   The official, who briefed reporters today, said he believed that
about 500 Albanian insurgents organized into ``8 to 10 elements''
were in the ``no-man's land'' between eastern Kosovo and Serbia and
in the Presevo Valley.
</P>
<P>
   NATO military officials are concerned that the Albanians are
making targets of Serbian policemen there, which could provoke a
crackdown against the Albanians from the Yugoslav president,
Slobodan Milosevic. This, they fear, could cause a possible repeat
of circumstances that caused NATO's war last year over Kosovo:
Serbian repression of ethnic Albanian civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The senior Pentagon official said Tuesday that it had not been
decided how NATO would react if that happened. ``At what point you
make a move, that's a political decision,'' he said. ``As of today,
we cannot cross over'' into Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The official said the Clinton administration was attempting to
deliver a serious message to the ethnic Albanian leadership in
Kosovo, particularly through the State Department spokesman, James
P. Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting on Tuesday in Gnjilane, the main town in the
eastern zone, Rubin told local leaders from the Presevo Valley that
NATO would not intervene if a conflict blew up beyond the Kosovo
borders.

A NEW SPIN THAT MAKES A NEW SONG  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 19) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANN POWERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   You can't forgive her for this,'' a fellow Madonna fan declared
to me recently as her reworking of ``American Pie,'' from the
soundtrack to ``The Next Best Thing,'' wafted through the
microbrewery where we sat.
</P>
<P>
   My friend was not alone in being offended that the queen of pop
would even consider touching Don McLean's relentlessly popular
ballad about ``the day the music died.'' With her version earning
violently mixed reactions, it is evident that this dare was as
risky for Madonna as her many earlier, flashier ones had been.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Pie'' is one of the great monuments of musical
cheese, a song everyone scorns but few can resist. Since its
overwhelming success in 1972, its eight minutes of tangled
allusions to the icons of the turbulent 1960s, offered by McLean in
a collegiate folkie's warble, have come to represent the nadir of
songwriterly self-seriousness.
</P>
<P>
   Its defenders love ``American Pie'' precisely because of those
references, which are actually about as cryptic as a good Sunday
puzzle. On the Internet, which has made such things documentable,
interpretations have been actively debated since at least 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Most read the song as an elegy for Buddy Holly and his innocent
rock 'n' roll. Others explore it as an account of the Kennedy
assassination or a Bible-tinged foretelling of the apocalypse.
</P>
<P>
   Parodies of the song hit a new level when the renowned lyric
juggler Weird Al Yankovic rewrote it last summer to coincide with
the release of ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phanton Menace.''
Besides Anakin Skywalker, others who have stood in for McLean's
Buddy Holly include Bill Gates, television science fiction heroes
from ``Star Trek'' and ``Babylon Five,'' and Charles Schulz.
</P>
<P>
   Self-described techno-nerds have written versions praising the
Linux operating system and defaming America Online. One industrious
fan even translated McLean's verses into Latin. This endless
dismemberment further alienates already contemptuous critics,
because it caricatures our own interpretive efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Pie'' has not attracted many top-notch artistic
interpreters either, although the proudly shameless Garth Brooks
and the truly bold Tori Amos have given it a whack. Respectable
rockers have generally stayed away from the song, leaving it to a
list of performers that includes the Dueling Banjos, the King's
Singers, the John Williams Orchestra and the Brady Bunch.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes Madonna, who usually works so hard to be
trend-setting, and, lately, tasteful. What does she sense in this
song? Her version trims every ounce of fat, eliminating three and a
half verses and almost all the references that have fascinated so
many listeners.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics and fans have denounced her for this. But Madonna
knows she is better served by myth than history, and so she and her
favorite sound designer, the producer William Orbit, have created
an anthem out of time, uninterested in the moment McLean depicted,
and surprisingly appropriate today.
</P>
<P>
   Madonna's ``American Pie'' captures the notion of the bystander,
which was the core of McLean's version, too. The seeming complexity
of the lyrics, and his somber delivery, obscured the fact that this
song was not about making history but about helplessly witnessing
it.
</P>
<P>
   Setting plaintively ethereal vocals against an anesthetic bed of
light beats and effects, Madonna tells the first-person part of
McLean's story, the saga of a shy, average fan whose soul was saved
just enough by rock 'n' roll to give him a small place in a
bewildering America.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Next Best Thing,'' the song creates exactly such a
place for an outcast group that Madonna has long championed. The
film's ``American Pie'' singalong is, in fact, an act of gay
liberation.
</P>
<P>
   Madonna's character, Abbie, and her gay pal and eventual
co-parent, Robert, played by Rupert Everett, stand with a dear
friend at the burial of his lover. Across the grave are the lover's
disapproving parents, who insisted on this church funeral instead
of what the deceased wanted: to have his ashes scattered in the
desert while his friends sang ``American Pie.'' Quietly, Robert
begins to sing, and eventually the pals join in, asserting their
rights through this blockbuster song.
</P>
<P>
   Everett, who is openly gay, insisted that the scene use
``American Pie'' instead of Madonna's choice, the punkier Patti
Smith song ``Easter,'' or a disco or show tune from the gay
liberation songbook. He must have realized the stronger impact of
attaching the notion of gay rights to this utterly mainstream song.
The moment encapsulates the film's message, which is that no one
should be excluded from ``normal'' life.
</P>
<P>
   Separate from the film, Madonna's version works differently.
Instead of acting as a key that admits exiles into the center of
society, her frostily cosmic ``American Pie'' reflects upon our
shared sense of being on the margin. The verses, about a fan who
hopelessly wishes to be a star, a lover who watches someone steal
his sweetheart at a dance and a tripartite deity who boards that
old mystery train and departs, depict possibility straying beyond
one's grasp.
</P>
<P>
   People can relate to that feeling now, as the information age
progresses at a speed that most brains or modems cannot comprehend.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone believes Madonna's recent turn toward the
spiritual, which also informs her recording of an anthem many
consider vaguely religious. Whatever she really gets from her
well-publicized yoga practice, the singer has again homed in on an
emerging social mood.
</P>
<P>
   Don McLean's ``American Pie'' was a cry for things to slow down
during the spasmodic death of the counterculture. As intense as
public life was then, things are moving even faster today.
Madonna's ``American Pie'' taps into people's hunger to be more
than witnesses. Beneath its cool veneer is a longing for the
opposite: music that comes close enough to touch, a call to life
instead of a lament for what we let die.

TEXAS LOTTO BETTING ON HIGHER ODDS TO JACK UP POT, TAKE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In a risky move calculated to increase ticket
sales, the Texas Lottery Commission on Tuesday tentatively agreed
to add four balls to the 50-ball lotto drawings, a change designed
to fatten jackpots by making them harder to win.
</P>
<P>
   Despite predictions that the major rule change will upset some
loyal lotto players, it could jack up sales by $166 million a year,
officials estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in June, players would have to match their six chosen
numbers with the six numbered balls drawn from a batch of 54 balls,
under rules unanimously approved by the three-member commission.
</P>
<P>
   The change would make the odds of winning about one in 25.8
million. As the game is now, with 50 balls drawn, the odds of
winning are one in 15.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The same proposal was put forward last year as a way to bolster
sagging ticket sales, but it was withdrawn due to player
opposition. The players argued against any significant change in
the game rules or odds of winning.
</P>
<P>
   Unsure how to proceed and under legislative scrutiny, the
commission conducted a series of public hearings around the state
late last year to gather ideas. Officials warned that the odds
change, though unpopular among some players, would be necessary if
sales didn't improve.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, for example, average weekly sales in the first half
of fiscal year 1999 were $2.1 million, but in fiscal 2000, the
Houston average has sunk to $1.4 million a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's vote begins the formal process to make necessary
changes to the Lotto Texas game to renew player interest,'' said
Chairman Harriet Miers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We indicated last fall changes should be considered if sales
did not improve. While instant ticket sales have improved, Lotto
sales remain sluggish. We hope to engender renewed excitement about
Lotto Texas,'' Miers said.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, the commission agreed to publish in the Texas
Register proposed rules that would implement the change. After a
30-day public comment period, the commission may consider adopting
the rules as proposed, but the changes wouldn't take effect until
June, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This action today should not come as a surprise to anyone,''
said Lottery Director Linda Cloud.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although Texas has one of the largest beginning jackpot prizes
in the country ($4 million), many of our players don't get excited
enough to get into the game until the jackpot climbs into the
double-digit range,'' Cloud said.
</P>
<P>
   She projected that the $166 million in additional sales would
yield an extra $26 million a year for the Foundation School Fund,
which supports Texas public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Cloud added that within a year, the change should increase
average jackpots from $9 million to about $19 million. To achieve
that, the payout would increase from the current 50 percent of
sales to 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Lower tier prizes also would increase, Cloud said.
</P>
<P>
   The public can comment on the proposal by writing the Texas
Lottery Commission, attention Kimberly L. Kiplin, general counsel;
P.O. Box 16630, Austin, Texas, 78761-6630.

   In two separate trials that concluded Monday and Tuesday, the
men were convicted of putting the drug into a soft drink consumed a
year ago by Samantha Reid, a 15-year-old high school freshman who
lived in the southern suburbs of Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   After telling her mother that she was going to a movie, Samantha
went instead to a small party with two friends. All three girls
were apparently served GHB-laced drinks at the party without their
knowledge. Samantha died within hours, while one of her friends,
Melanie Sindone, went into a coma for half a day. She has since
recovered. The third girl did not touch her drink.
</P>
<P>
   Samantha's death brought nationwide attention to the spread of
GHB, or gamma hydroxybutyrate, which can be made in a kitchen using
recipes from the Internet that include ingredients like paint
remover, furniture polish remover or drain clearing agents. Two
Michigan Republicans, Rep. Fred Upton and Sen. Spencer Abraham,
pushed legislation through Congress this winter putting GHB on the
federal list of the most-controlled substances. It joins heroin and
LSD as a so-called Schedule 1 drug.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton signed the legislation last month, and it took
effect Monday. The new law, which does not apply to Samantha's
case, prescribes prison sentences of up to 20 years for GHB
trafficking, and life sentences when a death occurs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to involuntary manslaughter, Joshua Cole, 19, and
Daniel Brayman and Nicholas Holtschlag, both 18, were convicted of
two counts each of mixing harmful substances in drinks. They were
acquitted of a more serious poisoning charge, mixing lethal
substances in drinks.
</P>
<P>
   The three men face up to 15 years in prison for the manslaughter
charge and up to five years for each of the lesser poisoning
charges; they could have been sentenced to life in prison if they
had been convicted of the more serious poisoning charge. A fourth
man, Erick Limmer, 26, was convicted of being an accessory to
manslaughter, mixing a harmful substance in a drink, delivery of
marijuana and possession of GHB. He faces up to five years in
prison on the most serious of these charges, being an accessory to
manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Sentencing for all four men was set for March 30. Douglas M.
Baker, Wayne County's deputy chief prosecutor for drug cases, said
he would insist on jail time for the men, but he had not decided
what sentences to recommend.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors said Cole told the police that he put the GHB in
the girls' drinks to make the party more ``lively.'' The other
three defendants unsuccessfully contended that Cole, who was tried
separately, should be held solely responsible for the crime.
Holtschlag's lawyer, Brian T. Dailey, declined to comment Tuesday
on the verdict. Lawyers for the other three men did not return
telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, 65 GHB-related
deaths and more than 5,700 documented cases of GHB abuse have
occurred since 1990, when the Food and Drug Administration banned
sales of the substance. There have also been 15 sexual assault
cases involving 30 victims drugged with GHB.
</P>
<P>
   Tiny quantities of the drug produce lassitude and a temporary
euphoria, and sometimes hallucinations. Its use is frequently
followed by temporary memory loss. But the slightest variation in
the quantity or purity of the drug can produce unconsciousness and
even respiratory failure and death.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians recommend that a person rendered unconscious by GHB
receive immediate care from an ambulance crew or emergency room
doctors who have been told to suspect the drug's presence.
Toxicologists have said that Samantha died because the young men
argued among themselves instead of seeking immediate medical
attention for her when she passed out.

<TEXT>
<P>
   No one was selling peanuts, and instead of metal bars there were
velvet ropes, but Elton John, the evening's prize peacock, was
being scrutinized as surely as if he were in a zoo.
</P>
<P>
   It was Dec. 9, 1999, the opening-night performance of Disney's
``Aida'' in Chicago, a little more than three months before the
Broadway opening on Thursday at the Palace Theater.
</P>
<P>
   At the party afterward, hundreds of people trooped into the
Hotel Allegro, where John was escorted into an elegant holding pen.
A few friends followed, including a stout Billie Jean King and a
willowy Lynn Wyatt, the Texas socialite, who had flown in just to
see the show (what fun!). The fact that the hotel had arranged a
VIP platter for them that combined sushi and pastries fazed John
not at all; he dove for the chocolate while the show's press agent
valiantly blocked the television cameras. After all, the man has
given up drinking, drugging and (most of) his other bad behavior.
Can't a superstar eat an eclair in peace?
</P>
<P>
   The gawkers lined up, chewing their own food, and watched John
from the world outside the rope. That is a byproduct of celebrity,
of course. It's just that some of those gawkers also happened to be
in the cast or on the staff of ``Aida'' and they wanted a look,
too. Because, besides his one visit to a New York rehearsal last
September, they hadn't seen him either.
</P>
<P>
   This night was the first time the composer had watched his own
show in its revised version, following a disastrous attempt in
Atlanta in 1998. No midnight conferences on the road for him. You
want something, you can fax him. Jule Styne must be scoffing in his
grave.
</P>
<P>
   But as one of those ubiquitous Disney songs has it, Broadway has
indeed become ``a whole new world,'' one in which industry types
are just grateful that an internationally known songwriter like
Elton John would deign to sit down and write a score at all,
because really, why should he? The theater is not only hard work
but collaboration, and this man has done just fine by himself,
thank you, selling more than 60 million albums during his 30-year
career.
</P>
<P>
   Like everyone else, though, he wants more. I met with him
earlier that day in Chicago, in his suite at the Four Seasons
Hotel, where he talked about being 52 and finding that life as a
legend isn't quite enough. He would still like to grow, try
something new. So when Disney executives presented him with the
children's-book version of ``Aida'' by Leontyne Price, herself a
famous Aida, he and the lyricist Tim Rice, his collaborator on
three songs for ``The Lion King,'' went for it. They were mostly
excited, John said, that it was not a remake of an animated
musical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also the fact that it had already been done by Verdi was
playing with fire,'' John said that afternoon, curled up on a fat
red couch. ``It appealed to my sense of masochism.'' He was
barefoot and wearing a black velour bathrobe with ``Aida''
emblazoned on the back. The ever-present plate of cookies sat on
the table before him and his robe fell open just enough to show his
bare chest. I halfway expected him to pick up the remote and turn
on ``One Life to Live.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to plot, though, daytime drama has nothing on this
``Aida,'' which varies from the opera. A Nubian princess, the title
character, is captured by an Egyptian warrior, Radames, who falls
in love with her instead of his betrothed, Amneris, an Egyptian
princess; when the forbidden romance is revealed, Amneris shows
mercy by letting them die together, buried alive in the same tomb
(mercy being a somewhat relative notion).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tragic but hopeful love triangle,'' John says, ``with
people giving up everything for love, everything they owned, their
customs, religious teachings. They are willing to die together
because they love each other.''
</P>
<P>
   John wrote the songs the same way he always does, lyrics first,
faxed by Rice. ``The big advantage was that it started with a story
and we wrote it to running order,'' John said. ``Disney said not
for me to say this but I wrote it in 21 days, including the
instrumental music. It came out very quickly. What `The Lion King'
did for me was to open so many doors. I'm a comfortable artist,
concerts always sold out, which is nice, but that can be boring. It
takes courage to diversify and have other challenges. I want to
succeed desperately, but I'm a novice. I have a great CV, but I'm
putting my foot in the water with this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney is, too. ``Aida'' is the first stage musical it is
producing under the umbrella of its new Hyperion Theatricals unit;
the different name is meant to emphasize that the show is not
geared toward children. It is also the first Disney show that has
not been adapted from an animated movie, like ``The Lion King,''
``Beauty and the Beast'' or ``The Hunchback of Notre Dame,'' which
opened to lukewarm notices in Berlin last June, where it is still
playing.
</P>
<P>
   It is no secret that Disney could use a public relations coup
with ``Aida,'' instead of the black eye it got with the Atlanta
version; the company's financial travails in the last year have
cast its chief, Michael Eisner, in a less than glowing light.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To this end, Disney has hired some of the theater's best talent
for the ``Aida'' team. After the Atlanta run, in which an enormous
pyramid chronically malfunctioned, Disney hired the director Robert
Falls, who last season won a Tony Award for his revival of ``Death
of a Salesman.'' He and David Henry Hwang, who won a Tony for ``M.
Butterfly,'' have rewritten the book that was begun in Atlanta by
Linda Woolverton.
</P>
<P>
   Also new is the set and costume designer Bob Crowley, who won
his Tony for ``Carousel,'' and Wayne Cilento, the choreographer,
who won his for ``Tommy.'' The three stars are: Heather Headley in
the title role (she was Nala, the young lioness in ``The Lion
King''); Sherie Rene Scott as Amneris (Randy Newman's ``Faust''),
and Adam Pascal as Radames (``Rent'').
</P>
<P>
   While the show is said to cost $15 million _ the same cost
estimate as ``The Lion King'' _ Peter Schneider, chairman of Disney
Studios, refused to verify the amount. ( Schneider and Thomas
Schumacher, president of feature animation at Disney, are the
producers of ``Aida.'') ``We never talk about money,'' Schneider
declared. ``At the end of the day, it is immaterial what it
costs.'' (Is it any wonder that the rest of the theater industry
resents them?)
</P>
<P>
   None of the intrigue, offstage or on, however, seems to concern
John. ``Because I'm a busy bee and I've got a career of my own,
I've really left it to them,'' he said. ``I'm not going to swan
onto the stage and say I'm Elton John. I'm going to tell Bob Falls
what to do? I don't think so. He just won a Tony for `Death of a
Salesman.' You have to let people edit and you have to be able to
take that, otherwise it's not worth it. Some things with `The Lion
King' I got my way and some I didn't. That's the whole point of
being out of town and having the opportunity to see if it works.''
</P>
<P>
   John was stung by the reception for last summer's release of the
all-star ``Aida'' concept recording that included artists as varied
as the Spice Girls and Boyz II Men. People magazine included it in
its ``Worst of Song'' list for the year, saying, ``Roll over
Beethoven and tell Verdi the news: this popmeister version of his
1871 opera is a tragic bore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Universal didn't believe `Aida' was going to happen,'' John
said. ``They did the record to appease me and didn't promote it. In
hindsight, doing an eclectic album before the stage version comes
out, well, live and learn. It didn't do as well as it should have
done.''
</P>
<P>
   And though British tabloids screamed that he might be
financially strapped, after problems with his former manager, John
said he was doing fine. ``Everyone assumes I'm in debt,'' he said.
``I sacked my manager two years ago because my finances were in a
mess. Unfortunately, I trusted someone and shouldn't have. But I
don't stick pins into voodoo dolls. I can always go out and make
money. I've had to pay attention to it now the same way I had to
pay attention to my drug habit. It's no good saying I don't want to
know about it.''
</P>
<P>
   He has something of a nest egg certainly, from his astonishing
string of hits starting in 1971 with ``Your Song'' to his remake of
his own ``Candle in the Wind,'' which he performed at the funeral
of his friend Diana, Princess of Wales, in September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   That loss came on the heels of the murder of another friend,
Gianni Versace, who, John says, had loved his score of ``Aida.''
Since Versace's murder in July 1997, John said, ``I take
precautions now in America. I have a bodyguard. But not in London.
You can't be a prisoner because of fear. In England, where I live
most of the time, the rules are different. The press can be so
vicious. America reveres personalities and stars so much, but in
England they love you for five minutes then shoot you down. I'd
rather have that, actually, than be shut off in that Michael
Jackson or Barbra Streisand control syndrome where you end up
having no clue what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   In the States, John keeps an apartment in Atlanta because of its
airport; he can play mostly anywhere and fly home at night. ``I've
been 30 years on the road as Elton John and I prefer to come
home,'' he said. ``Atlanta is a place where I can breathe and not
be involved in the Elton John industry 24 hours a day.''
</P>
<P>
   On this wintery day, at least, he seemed quite mellow, sitting
around all cozy in his robe. ``I threw a huge party when I turned
50 because at one point I thought I'd never make 50, the way I've
lived my life,'' he said. ``I always had a problem with my weight
and that gets harder as you get older. But I've never been happier.
I'm calmer. There is always a Vesuvius in me, in any creative
person. I see my picture in the newspaper and look the size of
Orson Welles, but from an inner point of view I think it's great.
I'm fit. I play tennis. No coke, no drinking, no smoking. After the
amount of excess in my life, this is a bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone says in one of my prior lives I was Louis XIV,'' he
continued, ``but in my next life I'd like to be a woman, see things
from their perspective. As a gay man who was married for six years,
I'm interested in what women feel, what they need.'' He giggled.
``Plus the clothes, the accessories are so much better. I'd need a
whole house just for the handbags.''
</P>
<P>
   For almost seven years, John's partner has been David Furnish, a
filmmaker, and between that relationship and his work, he says he
is content. ```Lion King' and `Aida' got me out of doing the
album-to-video syndrome,'' he said. ``I loathe and detest videos.
With a couple of exceptions they're all dreadful. An artist can
only learn by going out and playing live, which keeps him or her
learning the craft, building an audience and a fan base. Videos are
an incredible waste of money, and young talent today is all about
how many records and videos they've sold. It's sad.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When we finished talking, he changed into his long Versace
sparkled coat and pants and went to the opening, where he seemed
genuinely proud. Unlike Eisner, who was seated in front of him,
scribbling busily, John took no notes.
</P>
<P>
   En route to the party, he stopped backstage to see the cast.
``Look who's here!'' enthused Falls. ``How much do we love Elton?''
The group applauded dutifully as the composer made the rounds,
hugging the two female leads, then . Pascal.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner pulled John aside, praising the show, as a photographer
snapped their picture. ``We have a little ways to go, I think,''
John said, beaming. ``That's why we're here,'' Eisner beamed back.
</P>
<P>
   The following morning, Richard Christiansen gave ``Aida'' a
mixed review in The Chicago Tribune, calling it a combination of
``the good, the bad and the what were they thinking?''
</P>
<P>
   Work began again. John and Rice wrote a new song for Pascal;
Falls and Hwang rewrote much of the book; Cilento trimmed the
dances. By the time previews began in New York on Feb. 25, the
company was optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   At the Sunday matinee on Feb. 27, the house was packed and John
sat with Schumacher to watch the changes. It had been a week in
which John was much in the news; after receiving a lifetime
achievement award on the Grammy broadcast, he was reportedly rude
backstage, alienating Grammy officials and even Billy Joel, who had
flown out to Los Angeles especially to present the award. That
Sunday, though, he seemed to be in good spirits, making jokes at
which Schumacher laughed too loudly, causing everyone around them
to turn and stare.
</P>
<P>
   But about 15 minutes into the first act, John got up and left in
a diva-sized huff. He did not like some incidental music that had
been written by the dance arrangers _ a practice common in
musicals. Instead of staying to give notes, he got on a plane and
flew back to Atlanta, leaving the rest of the company dispirited,
to put it mildly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were shocked, surprised and embarrassed by his behavior,''
Falls said a few days later. ``It was plain and simply rude. He
called the next day and apologized, actually. He said he couldn't
help himself, that he's a perfectionist.'' Falls sighed. ``The sad
thing about Elton self-destructing the way he did is that he really
cares about the show and has a genuine desire to push himself into
new areas. In the year and a half I've worked with him he has been
a gentleman, down to earth, unpretentious, trusting and open to
collaboration, something not every top superstar is.''
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't help but remember the party in Chicago, where one of
the people inside the holding pen was Bob Halley, John's personal
assistant of 25 years. Didn't he find it odd that his boss was at
the party, but not at the party? He looked over at John, who was
listening, rapt, to Billie Jean King beside him on the couch, while
the line for the bar snaked past them, people pointing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah,'' he said cheerfully. ``It's show biz.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Mink skins, with or without head, tail or paws.
Diesel locomotives. Pure-bred asses and mules.
</P>
<P>
   These are the turn-of-the-millennium equivalents of
throw-weights and hard-target killers, the stuff of diplomatic
progress between world superpowers. These days, when the United
States and China take confidence-building measures, they deal in
capers, not submarine-based missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, responding to congressional
pressure, Tuesday declassified and released a 250-page document,
entitled ``Agreement on Market Access Between the People's Republic
of China and the United States of America.'' Both sides have hailed
the agreement, signed last November, as their greatest diplomatic
breakthrough since they re-established economic ties in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   The accord helps redefine relations between the world's most
powerful country and its most populous one. But it does so without
much diplomatic wordplay or soaring verbiage. In fact, there are no
more than a handful of passages that include full English
sentences. It is less a treaty than a spreadsheet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the United States has ever negotiated a trade
agreement with this kind of specificity,'' said Ira Wolf, a senior
trade adviser to Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., and certainly one of the
few people outside of the U.S. Trade Representative's office to
peruse the eye-straining small print.
</P>
<P>
   Until Tuesday, the document had been distributed only to people
with security clearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wipes out all the ambiguity,'' Wolf said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has called the agreement, negotiated over 13
years, a cornerstone of bilateral relations. It helps clear the way
for China to join the World Trade Organization, the regulatory
agency in Geneva. More broadly, it enshrines in print China's
commitment to allow capitalism _ at least as far as next-day
courier services, life insurance policies and nonrefractory mortars
add up to capitalism _ to spread to most regions and most corners
of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton faces perhaps his last big legislative battle to get
Congress to agree to a step that would let American companies
benefit from the pact, granting China permanent normal trade
status. Congress would sacrifice its annual review of China's trade
status, in effect providing Beijing with the same trading rights in
the United States that most other nations have.
</P>
<P>
   The mood of Congress is mixed. Although many lawmakers argue
that the accord is a clear winner for U.S. companies, some
Republicans and Democrats alike say China does not deserve
permanent rights because it violates international standards of
human rights and threatens to use force against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials have called the vote, which
they hope to have by Memorial Day, too close to call.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The administration has summarized the main benefits of the
agreement for months, but the text was kept classified until
Tuesday. Both sides agreed to keep it secret while China was
negotiating with other nations to join the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   Though lawmakers, their aides and some executives viewed the
text in secure rooms, supporters of the accord demanded that the
administration release it publicly. The secrecy had become a potent
issue for unions and consumer groups opposed to giving China
permanent trading rights.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have argued that the administration and the World
Trade Organization have conspired to keep many trade issues under
wraps because they fear public scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   The administration sought China's approval for an early release
of the text. Beijing agreed, in its eagerness to win the related
vote in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., who supports granting permanent
status, said the release could clear up lingering uncertainties.
``This makes the job of explaining the concrete benefits of
bringing China into the rules-based trading system a little
easier,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But some lawmakers who say they are wary about permanent status
said the release had not turned them into supporters. ``It's a
little late,'' Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., said, adding that the
administration was trying to rush a vote.
</P>
<P>
   With the agreement's reading like a complex arms-control treaty,
it is a sweeping blueprint for commercial relations between China
and the United States well into the 21st century. Rarely has the
United States pinned down a trading partner on so many elements of
business life.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest breakthroughs were in farm products, where China
dropped nontariff barriers to imports of virtually everything from
wheat to harvesters, though many such goods will remain subject to
quotas.
</P>
<P>
   The United States says China made another concession when it let
Washington treat it as a nonmarket economy for 15 years. That gives
Washington leeway to impose duties on imports from China if it
decides that China is flooding the American market with goods
produced below cost.
</P>
<P>
   But the document, several inches thick, is perhaps more notable
for its breadth than any of the specifics.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement charts how many films foreign producers could show
each year in Chinese movie theaters (20), when foreign banks can
start dealing in Chinese currency (two years after it joins the
trade organization) and what equity foreign telecom companies can
hold in Chinese mobile phone services (49 percent).
</P>
<P>
   The pact would establish a tariff on truffles for 2004 (25
percent). It dictates when foreign insurers can begin selling
policies in Dalian (no later than 2002).
</P>
<P>
   The agreement looks more like a work in progress than a polished
communique. In part because negotiators were racing to complete the
agreement in November before trade ministers met in Seattle, many
sensitive areas were settled by 11th-hour scribbling in the
margins.
</P>
<P>
   One notation made sure that foreign financial leasing services
would be allowed to operate as soon as China let domestic companies
engage in such leasing.
</P>
<P>
   And at the last minute, the Americans apparently agreed to
shorten the period for treating China as a nonmarket economy, to
the 15 years, from 20.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has had a hard time enforcing earlier trade accords
with China when commitments and timetables were vague. And the
bureaucracy and regional governments have sometimes been slow to
comply with pacts signed in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Charlene Barshefsky, the U.S. trade representative,
decided to leave little to chance, supporters of the agreement
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have that kind of detail, three years later you
will discover loopholes,'' says Mickey Kantor, Clinton's former
chief trade official and now a trade lawyer.

   NEW YORK _ Ever since museums made paintings available for
viewing to the general public, people worldwide have strolled
quietly by all manner of nudes, mostly female, and often
voluptuous.
</P>
<P>
   Schoolboys may titter among themselves in front of a disrobed
``Olympia''; girls, too, may laugh at the rolls of flesh that once
passed as sexy in Renoir's ``Bathers.''
</P>
<P>
   But what will they do in front of Elie Xyr's painting ``Bora
Bora Wahines,'' in which two hungry-eyed women with bulging biceps
and breasts each the size of a football are sexually engaged with
one happily dazed, mustached man? Or the portrait of the
bodybuilder Sharon Marvel wearing only a sheer silk top with a
large slit straight down the middle and black stiletto heels at the
base of hard-as-steel, vein-popping legs?
</P>
<P>
   We'll find out when the New Museum of Contemporary Art in SoHo
unveils its ``Picturing the Modern Amazon'' on March 30. From
drawings of the ``Female Sampson'' (Angela d'Atalie, 1873) to
artfully staged photographs of ebony-skinned muscle-women by Andres
Serrano (with paintings, sculptures and comic book covers in
between), the exhibition, which runs through July 2, will
unabashedly proclaim a new participant in the 30-year-old
discussion of body art: the hypermuscular woman.
</P>
<P>
   As if this weren't enough, a few blocks away the Thread Waxing
Space ups the ante starting on Friday, through April 29, with
``Achieving Failure: Gym Culture 2000,'' a critical look at the
body beautiful and all that's needed to attain it: free weights,
machines, barbells and, of course, mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   Why this hyperattention to the hypersinewy body?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's astonishing how many contemporary artists are addressing
this issue,'' says the New Museum's chief curator, Dan Cameron,
``and as often happens, it's just a matter of time before the
culture at large catches up.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the hope of ``Modern Amazon's'' three curators: Laurie
Fierstein, herself a bodybuilder, Judith Stein and Joanna Frueh,
three women long involved in the feminist movement, who feel that
sculptured female bodies pose important questions to a
body-image-crazed society.
</P>
<P>
   Fierstein, a 4-foot-10-inch powerhouse who began weightlifting
in 1979 after an ankle injury, says: ``The idealized body is the
emaciated body, while muscular women are invisible. We take up too
much public space, and women's bodies are not supposed to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Fierstein's idea to address her concerns via an art
exhibition. ``The art world deals with issues of visual dialogue,''
she said during an interview in which she eagerly shed her jacket
to reveal biceps larger than a reporter's none too small thighs.
``Contemporary museums are used to pushing the envelope, especially
in terms of gender and identity issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Fierstein has pushed a few envelopes herself, sporting a body
that in her words inspires reactions ranging from ``lust to dread
to embarrassment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Muscularity equates with power,'' she said, ``and men don't
want women to have that. Big, hard, round muscles generate a sexual
disequilibrium that is very threatening.''
</P>
<P>
   So where does the ``art'' come in and how? Stein, a critic and
the curator of more than 90 contemporary-art exhibitions (who, by
the way, admits to bench pressing 65 pounds a few times a week),
places bodybuilding in the politicized performance-art environment
of the 1970s and '80s. ``Several artists used their own bodies as
their medium,'' she says, ``including Gilbert and George, who
exhibited themselves as living sculpture, and Hannah Wilke, who
posed nude to mimic a controversial Duchamp sculpture.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Bruce Nauman and Howard Fried, videotaped
themselves moving around their studios in sculptural formations
intended to manifest the role of the body itself in the making of
art.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Picturing the Modern Amazon,'' named for the superstrong
and fierce women of Greek myth, bodybuilding is equated with
sculpture. Stein points out that the founder of bodybuilding,
Eugene Sandow, saw himself as a living Greek statue to such a
degree that when he posed, he covered himself with white powder the
better to resemble carved marble.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To the skeptical, Irving Lavin, a professor of art history at
the Institute of Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., confesses in a
catalog essay: ``I had spent a large part of my professional career
as an art historian blindly studying the representation of the
human figure in the visual arts without seeing the subjects who
were hidden within and behind the objects of my devotion. Was the
model for the Venus of Willendorf a bodybuilder? How did she
achieve those extravagant shapes?''
</P>
<P>
   Lavin received this awakening from his daughter, Amelia, a
photographer represented in the exhibition, who has had a longterm
interest in bodybuilders.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 40 other artists in the exhibition are Louise
Bourgeois, Judy Chicago, Renee Cox, Sidney Goodman, Matthew Barney,
Annie Liebovitz, Herb Ritts and Cindy Sherman. Also included are
portraits of Battleaxe, Jaguar, Nixa and, oh, yes, Bitchy Bitch,
Horny Biker Slut and Hothead Paisan, the Homicidal Lesbian
Terrorist, who, to real aficionados of the buffed body, are lead
characters from female comics who make television's Xena look like
Twiggy.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this will educate people in the aesthetics of the
body,'' says Frueh, an author and educator who has been pumping
iron for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Arning, the curator of ``Achieving Failure: Gym Culture
2000,'' developed an interest in gyms not to become a Hercules but,
more modestly, to rid himself of his ``unnecessarily large gut.'' A
resident of Chelsea (and recently named director of the List Visual
Arts Center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology), he felt
constantly judged by the neighborhood mantra ``No pecs _ no sex.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has a relationship to gym culture, whether they go or
not,'' he says, ``and I began to feel like the kid not being picked
for kickball in grammar school.'' Prodded by a knee injury
requiring physical therapy, he started lifting weights. Though
still battling the bulge, he appreciates ``the inherent surrealism
in gym activity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Performing the same motion 60 times in a row seems very
weird,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   In common with the curators of ``Modern Amazon,'' Arning is
interested in the sculptural aspects of weight lifting, but to him
it's the equipment and environment that are intriguing. He can
sound almost rhapsodic when describing the paraphernalia: ``The
machines themselves are either in bright, reflective, rounded
chrome metal scattering your sight in all directions, or linear
black-matte armatures that read as a lattice of gaps in space.''
You'd think he was talking about a new Frank Gehry design, or at
least a Frank Stella wall piece.
</P>
<P>
   The artists he has gathered share his enthusiasms while adding
their own critiques. Carlos Pisco, a former regular at Crunch on
Christopher Street (where Serrano can be spotted), takes on power
potions in ``Big Load'' (1997), a sculpture of oversize tea bags
packed with strength-building ingredients, while an artist calling
himself Lump Lipshitz creates a monument to wasted energy out of
discarded jockstraps.
</P>
<P>
   Arning wants people to find humor in the excesses of the cult of
the body as well as to reflect on the nature of art. ``As
nonproductive, nonwage-earning labor, working out is wonderfully
perverse,'' he says. ``It is not that different in many ways from
art making.''

ORACLE REPORTS 80 PERCENT INCREASE IN THIRD-QUARTER EARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (hm) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Buoyed by strong sales of Internet software,
Oracle Corp. reported on Tuesday an 80 percent gain in
third-quarter earnings, exceeding analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle said progress on its stated goal of cutting expenses by
$1 billion had increased its profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   Although the bulk of its revenue still came from its core
database business, Oracle has moved aggressively in the past year
to position itself as the software engine of the Internet.
Companies embracing electronic commerce and moving other business
practices to the World Wide Web increasingly use Oracle's database
and application software. Oracle has also used the Internet
internally to cut costs, centralizing tasks like human resources
that used to spread across many continents.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle shares closed at $77, down $1.75, amid the broad decline
of the Nasdaq on Tuesday. In after-hours trading, Oracle shares
traded as high as $81.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said they had expected a strong quarter, but had
received no guidance from Oracle suggesting that their estimates
would be too low. They noted that while software sales were up,
particularly compared to a somewhat weak quarter a year ago,
overall revenue growth was held back by a decline in consulting
business.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter, which ended Feb. 29, Oracle reported earnings
of $763 million, or 25 cents a diluted share. That compared with
$293 million, or 10 cents a share, in the comparable period a year
earlier. Sales rose 14 percent to $2.4 billion from $2.1 billion in
the third quarter of fiscal 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Third-quarter 2000 earnings include $432 million of pretax
investment gains from the sale of 11 percent of Oracle's holdings
in Liberate Technologies, a spinoff originally known as Network
Computer Inc. Without those gains, Oracle earnings increased 80
percent to $498 million, or 17 cents per diluted share, which was
better than the 13 cents expected by analysts surveyed by First
Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   ``If any software company is in a position to lead us into the
new economy, it is Oracle,'' said Bob Austrian, an analyst with
Banc of America Securities. ``One of the interesting takeaways here
is that Oracle's own financial benefit from using its technology is
an example for other companies. The real goal of this technology is
to wring the costs out of whole sectors of the economy, and Oracle
is using it to enhance revenues and dramatically increase profit
margins,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have become the software standard for the Internet,''
Lawrence J. Ellison, Oracle's chairman, said in a telephone
conference call with securities analysts. ``This is much more
important than mainframe computing or PC computing. This is a whole
new way of doing business. We're in this extraordinary position
where we're the only company that can offer a complete suite of
software to get major organizations and smaller organizations on
the Internet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Database software sales increased 32 percent, to $778 million.
Total applications software sales increased 35 percent, to $199
million. Within that total, sales of customer-relationship
management applications grew 179 percent, to $49 million, and
Internet purchasing software grew 231 percent, to $26 million.
Consulting, education and support revenues grew 10 percent, to $1.4
billion. Of that total, consulting was down 10 percent, education
up 10 percent and support up 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
   During the quarter, Oracle announced a series of so-called
Exchanges, Internet-based purchasing systems for major industries
including automobiles, with Ford, DaimlerChrysler and General
Motors, and retail, with Sears and Carrefour of France. Last week,
the company announced a program for government purchasing, and
announced Monday the creation of a new exchange for the lumber and
paper industries.

 Pacific Exchange Maps All-Electronic Future  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Ending an era in West Coast finance, the Pacific Exchange yesterday
unveiled an alliance to create an all-electronic exchange and
shutter its stock trading floors in San Francisco and Los Angeles.
<P>
   The San Francisco bourse said it plans to join forces with
Archipelago, one of a new breed of computerized stock trading
networks, to set up the new electronic exchange. The alliance is
the first between a traditional exchange and an electronic network.
</P>
<P>
   Details remain to be worked out and financial terms were not
disclosed. But if Pacific and Archipelago nail down a formal
agreement and the Securities and Exchange Commission gives its
blessing, the exchange would phase in its stock trading activity to
the new venture, beginning as soon as this year.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific's Los Angeles stock operation would probably close its
doors this year, while trading in its massive granite building on
Pine Street in San Francisco's Financial District would halt next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific's options trading floor in the Mills Building wouldn't
be affected by the move, though many observers expect that
operation eventually will be replaced by an electronic system too &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Pacific has previously said it intended to close its stock
trading floors. But the Archipelago alliance marks the first time
the exchange has put in place a specific program and timetable for
doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Securities industry experts said closing stock trading floors,
where frantic brokers buy and sell stocks in a central location, is
inevitable given the relentless march of computerization in the
securities business. Even the redoubtable New York Stock Exchange
is reportedly exploring options for switching to electronic
trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Floor trading is the equivalent of the slide rule or the buggy
whip,'' said Junius Peake, a finance professor at the University of
Northern Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Pacific Exchange is bound by tradition, and some see
sadness in the demise of its old floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cold, it's damp, but if you look up on the wall you see
photos of traders taken in 1935,'' said Mark Laurent, who has &LR;  been
 &LR; a floor trader in the Pine Street building for four years. ``A lot
of things have gone down there.''
</P>
<P>
   Pacific and Archipelago said their venture will create the first
all-electronic national stock exchange able  &LR; to trade shares from
the three major U.S. markets: the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq
and the American Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Investors could get access to a large pool of potential buyers
and sellers, which could make it easier to execute orders at the
prices they want. ``It could potentially give more eyeballs that
will see your order,'' said Chase H&AMP;Q analyst Greg Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific officials said an alliance with an electronic player
represents their best hope for reviving a money-hemorrhaging stock
market operation that has been losing business for years to
stronger rivals such as New York's Big Board. The exchange recently
changed its stock market operation from a membership association to
a for-profit corporation to make it more nimble.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need enhanced technology and a lower cost of doing
business'' to be competitive, said Philip DeFeo, Pacific's chairman
and CEO.chief executive. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Archipelago is one of several so-called electronic
communications networks, or ECNs, that have emerged in the last few
years and now handle more than one of every three trades on the
Nasdaq stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ECNs take orders from retail brokerages and match them directly
with orders from other customers. That eliminates the middleman
firms, called market makers or specialists, through which
traditional stock exchange trades are routed.
</P>
<P>
   Archipelago, the fifth-largest ECN, gets its orders from online
broker E-Trade, among other sources. Linking with the ECN gives
Pacific access to a large group of new customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago, I thought regional exchanges such as the Pacific
were dead,'' said Credit Suisse First Boston analyst James Marks.
``But these changes in trading are giving them new life.''
</P>
<P>
   New York Stock Exchange rules put strict limits on the ability
of ECNs to trade its stocks. Allying with Pacific, which is free to
trade New York stocks, provides Archipelago a way around those
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts predict more alliances between traditional exchanges
and ECNs that could dwarf the Pacific Archipelago venture. All the
same, said DeFeo, ``We are acting while they are talking.''
</P>
<P>
   The new arrangement will take business away from Pacific's
specialist firms, which who  &LR; employ fewer than 100 traders. The
firms are middlemen who promise to buy or sell shares, profiting
from small price differences. Still, the specialists will be needed
to handle orders when no matches are available and they could
benefit if the new exchange's business grows.
</P>
<P>
   ``ECNs have changed the dynamics,'' said Jonathan Werts,
president of the San Francisco Specialists Association. ``Traders
hate change, but we're also realists.``

 Webby Award Producers Catch Ecstatic Nominees by Surprise  &HT;     By Carolyn Said

 &QL; 
The contestants are off and running for this year's Webby Awards,
the digiteri's version of the Academy Awards.

   Technology publisher IDG, which produces the awards, yesterday
announced 135 Web site nominees in 27 categories ranging from

</P>
<P>
   The awards _ a metallic spiral imprinted with zeros and ones _
will be handed out May 11 in a ceremony at the Nob Hill Masonic
Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my gosh, we're ecstatic,'' said Lianne Morgan, chief
executive of the Marketing Store, a 35-person Web design company in
Sacramento. The firm broke out the champagne to celebrate snagging
a nomination in the fashion category for ``Solemates: The Century
in Shoes'' (www.centuryinshoes.com), a multimedia ``Web-umentary''
about how footwear reflects ``the changing passions, perspectives
and ideals of our culture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll help us help more folks out, and that ain't bad,'' said
Craig Newmark, founder of Craigslist.org, a San Francisco
classified-ads site nominated for Community. ``Maybe it will help
me launch other projects, like AskCraigsMom.com.''
</P>
<P>
   A 350-member panel of judges makes the nominations and picks the
winners. Celebrity judges include David Bowie judging in music,
actor Patrick Stewart in travel, cyber-guru Esther Dyson in
activism, Simpsons creator Matt Groening in humor, performance
artist Laurie Anderson in arts and commentator Arianna Huffington
in politics and law.
</P>
<P>
   Web surfers can also pick their favorites for the complementary
People's Voice Awards, casting ballots at www.webbyawards.com.
</P>
<P>
   Webby Award producers Tiffany Schlain and Maya Draisin were in
New York yesterday, along with a film crew, popping in unannounced
on nominees to tell them the glad tidings. ``I felt like Ed
McMahon,'' Schlain said. ``Usually we just call people and they're
crying, clapping, yelling _ we wanted to see it in person.''
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, a Webby staffer dressed as a bike messenger
delivered a cell phone to nominees and told them to press the call
button to hear the news.
</P>
<P>
   Schlain said soliciting entries from the whole Web community
helped ensure variety and diversity of the nominations. ``I worry
it's going to be like the Emmy's,'' with the same people and shows
up for awards year after year.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Webby producers try hard to hammer home the
comparison to the Oscars, even hiring PricewaterhouseCoopers to
audit the voting, they differ in one important respect: Webby
winners can't ramble on ad infinitum; instead, they have exactly
five words to blurt their thanks.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Webby Awards' fourth year of existence. The ceremony
has grown from a nightclub event to a lavish fest expected to
attract 3,000 attendees.

 _ SF CHRON   Big 3Q Gain in Income for Oracle 
 &HT;     By Kelly Zito 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Software titan Oracle further distanced itself from a difficult
first quarter yesterday, posting an 80 percent jump in income for
the third quarter on strong demand for its database licenses.
<P>
   Redwood Shores' Oracle, which makes software programs for
high-powered corporate networks, said income from operations for
the three months ended February 29 totaled $498 million (17 cents a
share), compared with $277 million (9 cents) for the third quarter
of last year.
</P>
<P>
   That handily beat the 13-cent average estimate of analysts
polled by First Call Corp. and matched so-called ``whisper''
estimates of 17 cents published in investment Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Net income rose by a whopping 160 percent to $763 million (25
cents a share), from $293 million (10 cents) a year ago. That
figure includes a $432 million investment gain from the sale of an
11 percent of its  &LR; stake in Liberate Technologies Inc., a San
Carlos firm that makes software for ``smart phones'' and other
Internet-cruising devices.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue for the three months ended February 29 grew to $2.4
billion, up from $2.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a terrific performance,'' said William Epifanio, an
analyst at J.P. Morgan Securities in New York, who rates the stock
a ``buy.'' ``It's great to see their fundamentals are catching up
with their stock price.''
</P>
<P>
   Oracle's stock price fell $1.75 to $77 in regular trading. After
its earnings were announced following the market close, shares were
trading above the $83 mark on electronic exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle's stock price slumped last fall when the company missed
sales forecasts for the first quarter. But since the beginning of
the second quarter, when it surpassed analysts' expectations,
Oracle shares have roughly doubled. Many investors have been
encouraged by the company's push into the online exchange arena and
strong post-Y2K sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming out of Y2K, the lockdowns are coming off and companies
are picking up their buying,'' said Gary Abbott, an analyst at
Punk, Ziegel &AMP; Co. who also maintains a ``buy'' rating on Oracle.
</P>
<P>
   However, most agree that the key factor behind the quarter was
Oracle's efforts to make good on Chief Executive Larry Ellison's
pledge last year to reduce of reducing  &LR; operating costs by $1
billion by June.
</P>
<P>
   ``Management has taken its goal of improved margins very
seriously and they're delivering on that promise,'' Epifanio said.
</P>
<P>
   Also boosting its bottom line was surging demand for software
that caters to the e-commerce boom. Oracle said customer
relationship management applications, which automate responses to
customer queries and help companies target potential customers by
gathering data on buying histories and preferences, rose 179
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The only dim spot on the company's earnings statement was its
consulting services revenue, which increased by a meager 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've really been de-emphasizing consulting,'' Oracle Chief
Financial Officer Jeff Henley told Bloomberg News. ``But we think
that may be hitting the bottom, and I think it may turn around and
grow this calendar year.''

 Stanford Endowment Gets New CEO 
 &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Robertson Stephens Chairman Mike McCaffery is leaving investment
banking after 22 years to return to Stanford, not as a student but
as president and CEO of the Stanford Management Co.
<P>
   He will be in charge of the university's $7.9 billion endowment
fund, which includes stocks, bonds, venture capital investments and
hundreds of acres of prime real estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an opportunity to do something different,'' said
McCaffery, who stepped down as CEO of Robertson Stephens two months
ago. ``This will permit me to use my experience and network and
move into the investment side from investment banking.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffery will assume his new post in September, replacing
Laurie Hoagland, who has held the job since 1991 and announced last
October that he will leave to oversee investments of the Hewlett
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The value of Stanford's stock, bond and venture capital
investments was reported to be $6.2 billion last August 31. But
sources close to Stanford say that excludes many unrealized gains
and about $1.7 billion in real estate holdings.
</P>
<P>
   As large as it is, Stanford's endowment trails those of Harvard,
Princeton, Yale and the University of Texas, a public university
whose wealth has been bolstered by land grants and oil.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford's targeted, long-term ``real rate of return,'' adjusted
for inflation, is 6.25 percent. Over the past decade it has
surpassed that goal in all but one year (1998), and last year its
endowment grew by 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Each year the endowment fund pays out about 5 percent of its
endowment, enough to cover about 12 percent of the university's
operating budget. That compares to about 30 percent coverage of the
operating expenses at Princeton and 23 percent at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most top executives who jump to a new job, McCaffery will
not be making more money. Sources close to the university say his
salary will be close to $500,000 plus incentives. That's just a
small fraction of his total compensation at San Francisco's
Robertson Stephens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not approach this job thinking about compensation at
all,'' said McCaffery. ``It's a great opportunity to become a
member of the Stanford community where I earned my MBA.''
</P>
<P>
   Life at Stanford should be more peaceful than at Robertson
Stephens, which has endured three ownership changes in the past
three years. It was bought by Bank of America in 1997, sold to
BankBoston in 1998 and sold again to Fleet Financial Group last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the investment bank is thriving. New CEO Bob Emery
said revenues &LR;  rose from $360 million in 1998 to $1 billion last
year and will exceed $650 million in the first quarter of this
year.

 &HT;    Bush, Gore clench party nominations in Southern primaries
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The math now matches what the nation has known
since last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   With solid support in his home state, and a big boost from his
brother's, Texas Gov. George W. Bush on Tuesday clinched the
Republican nomination for president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's six southern primaries also gave Vice President Al
Gore more than enough delegates to win the Democratic nomination to
face Bush in November.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who celebrated with supporters at the Dell Jewish
Community Campus in Austin, said he is ready for the fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I filed for president, I pledged I'd come home to Texas
with the nomination of my party,'' Bush told cheering supporters.
``Tonight we can say: Mission accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tennessee, where he voted for himself, Gore said Tuesday the
fall race will offer ``a real choice'' on how to approach the
nation's problems. After the polls closed, Gore said the November
race offers ``a choice between keeping prosperity going or going
back to the Bush-Quayle days of gigantic budget deficits and
paralyzed democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The presidential battles ended last week when Gore and Bush took
Super Tuesday wins that knocked Democrat Bill Bradley and
Republican John McCain from the race. Former Ambassador Alan Keyes,
who has earned only a handful of delegates, remains in the GOP
battle.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore won Tuesday contests in Texas, Louisiana,
Tennessee, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Florida, where Bush's younger
brother Jeb is governor and is being counted on to help deliver the
state for the GOP in November.
</P>
<P>
   An Associated Press analysis showed that Bush's delegate count
would reach 1,090 and Gore's would reach at least 2,540 by the end
of the night _ far more than either man needed.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush family political machine also produced two votes for
the Texas governor Tuesday. Former President George Bush and his
wife, Barbara, voted for their son in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets down to family and how lucky we are,'' the former
president said.
</P>
<P>
   The Tuesday sweep gave Bush more than the 1,034 delegates needed
to clinch the nomination that will formally be given to him at the
Republican National Convention in Philadelphia in August.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also has topped the 2,170 delegates needed for the
nomination to be awarded at the Democratic National Convention in
Los Angeles, also in August.
</P>
<P>
   In a Tuesday night e-mail, Gore congratulated Bush and invited
him to debate within two weeks. Gore also wants both candidates to
do without TV ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's agree to forgo all campaign advertising and instead
agree to a regular series of debates on the major issues facing the
country,'' Gore told Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he is not interested in forgoing television ads.
</P>
<P>
   Bush voted for himself last Wednesday in Austin, the morning
after he effectively won the nomination. Gore voted for himself
Tuesday in Tennessee. He told reporters he plans to make full
employment and universal health insurance key issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``This election is a real choice between two different ways of
approaching those problems and I want to be president to make sure
we solve these problems the right way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, Bush drew loud response from supporters when he
turned his attention to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are halfway _ but only halfway _ to ending the Clinton-Gore
era in Washington, D.C. To get there, we must face one more
Clinton-Gore campaign. The last week has been a preview. The Gore
campaign will say anything and try to win at any cost,'' said Bush,
reprising what has become an everyday jab.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will confront their tactics one more time, and this time we
will prevail and they will fail,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also said Gore cannot distance himself from President Bill
Clinton because the vice president has served as
``cheerleader-in-chief.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore can't solve campaign finance problems when he
symbolizes them,'' said Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said Tuesday he will go to work on earning support from
moderate Republicans and independents that Bush needed to win in
November. A CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll released Tuesday showed that
Bush, so far, is doing a better job of attracting McCain voters
looking for a new candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Bush held a 49 percent to 43 percent edge among the
likely voters surveyed. Eighty percent of the respondents who
identified themselves as McCain Republicans said they are now Bush
backers. Only 14 percent are siding with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Among ``McCain independents,'' Bush got 46 percent and Gore took
37 percent. ``McCain Democrats'' backed Gore by a 76 percent to 13
percent margin.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls conducted Tuesday by Voter News Service showed
McCain, though out of the race, picking up support from more than
20 percent of independents and Democrats who voted in GOP
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Today in Chicago, Bush will be endorsed by Illinois state Rep.
Jim Durkin, former chair of the McCain campaign in that state.
</P>
<P>
   In numbers that look good for Bush, the exit polls indicated
that Bush ran stronger among Democratic voters than Gore did among
GOP voters. Just 6 percent of voters in Republican primaries said
they would vote for Gore in November; twice as many Democrats said
they would defect to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Though Tuesday's outcomes were no surprise, Bush didn't miss a
chance to work on the image he wants to craft for November: Mr.
Inclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Because all major hotel ballrooms in Austin were booked by South
by Southwest events, the Bush party wound up at the new Jewish
center.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1998 letter to the Anti-Defamation League, Bush expressed
regrets for his 1993 statement that his Christian faith tells him
that heaven is open only to people who accept Jesus Christ as
personal savior.
</P>
<P>
   ``In discussing my own personal faith as a Christian, I in no
way meant to imply any disrespect or to denigrate any other
religion,'' Bush said in his letter to the ADL.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign booked the gymnasium at the Jewish center,
which opened in January, for $8,000. The campaign also had to make
some last-minute menu changes. Pork barbecue ordered before the
site was selected was deleted from the dinner provided to the
traveling press corps.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also used the event, with national television cameras on
hand, to highlight his support among minority officials. At last
Tuesday's victory party, Bush was introduced by Houston educator
Phyllis Hunter, an African-American, and U.S. Rep. Henry Bonilla of
San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, El Paso Mayor Carlos Ramirez, a Democrat and
longtime backer of Bush, did the honors.
</P>
<P>
   ``As president, this is a man who won't just do things right,
he'll do the right thing,'' said Ramirez. ``And for Democrats,
Republicans and independents, this is the candidate who offers the
most hope on the most important issue _ the education of our
children.''
</P>
<P>
   The emcee for the event was Texas Railroad Commissioner Tony
Garza, a Hispanic who many Republicans would like to see move on to
higher office.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is eager to be seen as a new breed of Republican, more
inclusive and always eager to bring minorities into the fold. He
appeared on television ads for Railroad Commissioner Michael
Williams, an African-American, and Texas Supreme Court Justice Al
Gonzales. Both were appointed by Bush and faced opponents in
Tuesday's GOP primaries. Both were opposed in the primary and were
enjoying early leads in their respective races.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's November effort depends heavily on carrying California, a
state where Hispanics have increasing ballot-box clout and have
clung to Democratic candidates in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's primaries ended a process that began a year ago with
fund-raising, continued through the Iowa GOP straw poll last August
and began in earnest with Bush's win in the Iowa caucuses on Jan.
24.
</P>
<P>
   After crushing losses in New Hampshire and Michigan, Bush
finally knocked McCain from the race by winning most of the Super
Tuesday contests, including New York, California and Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's Super Tuesday sweep knocked Bradley from the contest.

 A BUSINESS _ SF CHRON   10 Steps to Prevent Internet Sabotage 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
What should a small business do to protect itself against Internet
sabotage and possible hacker attacks on its computers?
<P>
   &LR;   &QL; 
 &LR; A: The California Society of Certified Public Accountants suggests
several ways to protect against e-terrorism, random hackers and
computer viruses. California CPAs who are systems and business
consultants came up with these 10 steps:
</P>
<P>
   1. Do not put sensitive information on a PC running Windows that
is always directly connected to the Internet through a fiber-optic
cable or DSL line.
</P>
<P>
   2. Put a properly configured firewall between your office
machines and the Internet. A firewall will keep outsiders from
seeing or poking into your office machines, especially when you're
not around.
</P>
<P>
   3. Keep your own Web site completely separate from your
sensitive business information. Have an Internet service provider
maintain your Web server and assume that this machine will be
hacked into sooner or later.
</P>
<P>
   4. Never download and run a program from the Web or received as
an e-mail attachment unless it comes from a reputable source and
you have good reason to run it.
</P>
<P>
   A. Assume that every floppy or program you get from the
``outside'' is ridden with viruses unless you have reason to be
certain otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   B. Separate business from pleasure. If you want to run screen
savers, games or other downloaded software, do it on your ``fun''
machine (perhaps at home). Make sure your staff does the same.
</P>
<P>
   5. Don't use Internet file transfer protocols ``telnet'' or
``ftp''(``anonymous ftp'' is OK). These Internet procedures send
passwords used to log onto remote servers in clear text over the
Internet. If you have to log onto other computers on the Net, use
encryption products such as SSH Secure Shell, which can be easily
downloaded from the Web.
</P>
<P>
   6. Regularly use available virus scanners such as Norton
Antivirus to catch bugs that make it into your system.
</P>
<P>
   7. Configure your PC not to boot from a floppy disk or CD, which
all too often harbor viruses. Always start up directly from the
hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   8. Get a systems pro to verify your setup is secure.
</P>
<P>
   9. If suppliers are attacked and cut off, be sure you have
fall-back arrangements with other suppliers to ensure your business
isn't interrupted.
</P>
<P>
   10. Review your business interruption insurance policy and be
sure it doesn't explicitly exclude cyber- or e-terrorism as causes
of loss.
</P>
<P>
   Redondo Beach CPA Kenneth Hamaguchi notes there are
industry-specific hosting sites that take care of much, if not all,
of the security issues _ for a price. For example, the nursery
industry has a new hosting site called Growzone (www.growzone.com)
where members can have their Web page created and maintained for
about $2,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Another idea is to set up a standalone system with all the
software you need. Take a CD recorder and copy the entire disk to a
CD. If someone hacks into your system, you should reformat the hard
disk and download the CD. Since it's a stand-alone, your main
accounting system can't be hit.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another Web site has lined up experts to selectively answer
small-business questions such as ``How do I bring my business
online?,'' ``Where do I begin to find investors?'' and ``What will
my staffing needs be?''
</P>
<P>
   Inc.com (www.inc.com), announced yesterday that it is
establishing a mentor program featuring more than 20 experts in a
variety of fields from marketing and finance to law and taxation.
Local contributors include Garage.com founder Guy Kawasaki and
``Guerrilla Marketing'' author Jay Levinson. (Inc.com will answer a
question a day and build up a library of queries and responses.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bill Hamilton of Daly City e-mailed to say I seemed to
sympathize with brick-and-mortar merchants in my discussion of
Internet taxation two weeks ago. Instead of taxing Internet
merchants to create a level playing (or paying) field, he suggests
removing the sales tax burden on all businesses. He also recommends
looking at Web sites of the Internet Tax Fairness Coalition
(www.nettaxfairness.org) and Americans for Tax Reform
(www.atr.org).
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Andy Ross, president of Cody's Books in
Berkeley, e-mailed to say pressure is building to force the state
Board of Equalization to force out-of-state companies with a
presence in California and e-commerce subsidiaries, like some of
the giant book retailers, pay their fair share of sales taxes.
Assemblywoman Carol Migden co-authored a bill to ``clarify''
existing law and get businesses such as BarnesandNoble.com and
Borders.com to pay sales taxes. The text of the bill, AB 2412, can
be found at www.leginfo.ca.gov/bilinfo.html.

 Baiting the Hook for Tech Execs  &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
One commodity that is scarcer and going up in price even faster
than Bay Area homes and gasoline is high-tech management talent.
<P>
   And no one knows this better than Bay Area executive recruiters
who are paid big bucks themselves to locate and lure savvy CEOs and
other top executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is so starved for top-rated talent that there's
been a significant escalation in what people are willing to pay to
get it in the past six months,'' said Mel Connet, who runs a CEO
recruiting firm of the same name in Atherton and conducts a dozen
or more searches a year.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this recent offer to a 38-year-old fast-tracker to move
to San Francisco from a top 500 U.S. company. According to Connet,
the offer included a $600,000-a-year base salary, $500,000 annual
bonus, $250,000 sign-on bonus, options on 7 percent of the
company's stock, reimbursement for up to $625,000 in lost stock
option gains at his current employer, $1 million home loan and
flights home every other weekend until he relocates his family.
</P>
<P>
   He turned down the job.
</P>
<P>
   John Holman, a San Francisco headhunter who has recruited about
150 CEOs during the past 22 years, said two or three years ago it
was common to hire a CEO for a 2 to 3 percent ownership stake after
initial public offering. Now the figure is often double that.
</P>
<P>
   Not only have salaries gone up but so have most other benefits.
``The bottom line is it's a wonderful time to be a candidate for a
senior executive position at a first class high-tech company,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Executive recruiter Valerie Fredrickson in Menlo Park said some
hot prospects might get 50 or more calls a week from headhunters.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Hewitt, CEO of Versata Inc. in Oakland, knows both the joys
of joining an Internet startup and the agony of attracting and
signing top talent.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Versata held its initial public offering and saw
its shares shoot up to $92.75 from $24 before settling back to
$64.75. Hewitt, who joined the company five years ago as chief
financial officer and beat out external candidates to become CEO in
1997, holds 1.5 million shares and a paper profit approaching $100
million. His salary of $180,000 and bonus of $110,000 a year is
almost incidental.
</P>
<P>
   Attracting top executives these days ``is harder than nails,''
said Hewitt, 56, a veteran executive and former undersecretary of
the U.S. Department of Energy. ``You can find a lot of `B' players,
but `A' players are really tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Versata, which makes software that automates
business-to-business e-commerce applications, recently had to hire
three top managers. It took five months to find a new CFO. ``I must
have interviewed 30 to 40 candidates and only ended up with two
real candidates,'' Hewitt recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Last November 30, the company landed Kevin Ferrell, former
investment banker and CFO of EQE International and McKesson Corp.
The cash portion of Ferrell's compensation was ``pretty small,''
but he negotiated options on 450,000 shares of Versata's stock and
the right to buy an additional 100,000 shares at $5.56 each. Those
options are worth more than $30 million based upon Versata's
current price.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley executive recruiter David Powell figures that
recruiters currently are searching for about 200 CEOs for local
companies and thousands of other candidates for such key positions
as CFO, vice president of sales and VP business development.
</P>
<P>
   Landing the right team of executives quickly is especially
important for dot-com companies if they are going to get to market
ahead of the competition. ``If Silicon Valley has an Achilles'
heel, it's management talent.'' Powell said. ``This is the most
critical issue today.''
</P>
<P>
   The demand for executive talent has exploded over the past three
years as venture capital firms have funneled billions of dollars
into startups. As these companies hit the jackpot by going public
or getting acquired, the investors have ever more cash to reinvest
with hot entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent survey by Korn/Ferry International, global
demand for executives jumped 16 percent last year, with tech talent
topping the list for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter of last year, hiring by dot-com,
telecommunications and other information technology companies
accounted for 27 percent of the total, according to Korn/Ferry, the
largest executive recruiting firm. That compared with to  &LR; 13
percent for financial services and 12 percent for health care and
pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for CEOs increased from 13 percent of the total in 1998
to 16 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, the survey noted.
</P>
<P>
   One executive who took the bait and jumped to an Internet
startup is Alan Naumann, 40, chief executive of Calico Commerce in
San Jose. After 15 years in various management positions at Cadence
Design Systems and Hewlett-Packard, Naumann decided to bail out in
1997 even though his salary and bonus of $212,148 at Calico
Commerce is about half what he was getting at Cadence.
</P>
<P>
   But the stock-option package more than made up the difference.
Naumann received a $240,000 loan from Calico to buy 1.2 million of
its shares for 20 cents each. Today, he holds about 1.5 million
shares in the company, which went public last September, and his
4.5 percent stake is worth about $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   However, a huge compensation package is not necessarily the main
motivator. Naumann said he had been previously approached by
executive headhunters but only became interested in switching from
chip design to the Internet world three years ago. ``I wanted to be
in the middle of the tornado,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But not just any dot-com opportunity. Naumann was interested in
a company with an opportunity to become 10 times as large as
Cadence's $1 billion size, as measured by revenues. He wanted a
company with a unique product that is already accepted in the
market, not just a concept. (Calico, which provides e-commerce
application software to help companies sell over the Web, had
already received a ``supplier of the year'' award from one of its
key customers, Cisco Systems.).
</P>
<P>
   Naumann also wanted to join a ``quality'' company with
first-class investors and a supportive board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The final factor was, was it the right place for me?, &LR; '' said
Naumann. ``Would I be allowed to set strategy? Would I have
significant stock ownership to reward me for taking risks?''
</P>
<P>
   At Calico, close to 35 percent of the stock was reserved for
employees. Naumann said this has been essential to hiring key
executives. For example, last year the company recruited Tayloecq &LR; 
Stansbury as vice president of its major sales unit from Xerox and
Art Knapp from BMC Software as chief financial officer by offering
each executive about 400,000 shares of Calico stock.
</P>
<P>
   More than 160,000 high-tech recruits in the United States
reportedly became millionaires last year by cashing in their
options. But not all startups have a happy IPO ending.
</P>
<P>
   Mohr, Davidow Ventures general partner George Zachary estimates
that only about 2 percent of companies nurtured by angel and
venture capital investors make it to the IPO launchpad.
</P>
<P>
   Of the remainder, he figures close to 40 percent of the startups
go nowhere, forcing the executives and employees to start all over
again. And the majority, close to 60 percent, get acquired, but in
many cases for just the value of their assets.
</P>
<P>
   But even as many companies fizzle, Silicon Valley is like an
industry on fertility drugs; it keeps spawning more and more
startups .
</P>
<P>
   Finding managers to head all these companies would be hard
enough. But executive recruiter Connet observes that ``experienced
startup CEOS are often less inclined to do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Stories of serial entrepreneurs abound, but many top executives
who have already made a mint, would rather serve on boards and
become angel investors where they can nurture other entrepreneurs
without sacrificing every waking hour.
</P>
<P>
   Mohr, Davidow's Zachary concurs that some high-tech veterans
don't want to lead the charge again and give up any chance of
leading a balanced life. ``They want to be like Obi-Wan Kenobi and
offer advice and connections, not swing the light saber,'' he said.
His Menlo Park venture capital firm has an investment portfolio of
about 40 companies and has 10 recruiting firms searching for about
100 executives at any time.
</P>
<P>
   As a sign of the times, Sequoia Capital in Menlo Park has hired
former Heidrick &AMP; Struggles headhunter April King as ``director of
people'' to provide hiring tips to the venture capital firm's
portfolio companies.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech giants like Hewlett-Packard, Lucent, Nortel and Oracle
continue to be training grounds for executive and technical talent,
but they are offering more incentives to their own workers to stay.
That means executive recruiters have to dig deeper. They are
drafting directors instead of vice presidents and managers who may
lack broad operating experience.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, executives from traditional industry have been
waking up to the allure of the new economy. Top managers of many
elite 500 U.S. companies have watched folks half their age become
multimillionaires and increasingly are following suit. For example:
</P>
<P>
   _Covad Communications of Santa Clara lured U.S. West
Communications Executive Vice President Bob Knowling to become CEO
in 1998 with $650,000 cash compensation, a $1.5 million signing
bonus and 1.4 million shares of stock priced at $1.50 each.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which went public January 22, has catapulted from
 &LR; to $97.12 from $18 per share, giving Knowling a paper profit
topping $140 million. As icing on the cake, Knowling received a
$500,000 loan to help purchase a house in the Bay Area, with 25
percent of the loan forgiven for each year he stays with the
company.
</P>
<P>
   _Webvan recruited Andersen Consulting CEO George Shaheen to lead
it last September just before the Foster City company went public.
Among the lures to join Webvan, which delivers groceries and other
products ordered online, Shaheen was offered 15 million shares of
stock, about 5 percent of the total, for $8 a share. (Webvan shares
peaked at $34 but have since tumbled to $10.25.)
</P>
<P>
   _EBay, the San Jose online auctioneer, recruited Margaret
``Meg'' Whitman from toymaker Hasbro in 1998, offering her a 6.4
percent stake in the company nine months before its stock offering.
Even after selling off some shares, her current 6.5-million-share
stake is worth about $1.2 billion.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Dean Richards, a weekend radio personality at WGN
radio, wears many hats these days.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday afternoon, he dashed out of a staff meeting and took
the elevator to the fourth floor of The Chicago Tribune. There, in
the middle of the newsroom, wedged between the picture desk and the
sports department, sits a television studio. Richards sat down,
pinned on a microphone and broadcast a report about the Chicago
Film Critics Awards on the 12 o'clock news of WGN Television.
</P>
<P>
   Later this week, Richards will write an article for the weekend
section of The Chicago Tribune; he is giving his picks for the
Academy Awards. Oh, and by the way, he also appears on WGN
television once a week to announce the winning numbers of the daily
lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Richards does not actually have so many jobs. He has one: he is
what executives call a ``content provider'' for Tribune Co., the
giant media conglomerate that is experimenting with turning
newspaper reporters into ``multimedia journalists'' and merging
Chicago media properties into one large newsgathering source.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment, which has been under way for several years,
offers what may be a glimpse into the newsroom of the future, say
Tribune executives who expect to introduce the approach into other
cities.
</P>
<P>
   That could happen soon. Tribune Co. announced Monday that it
would acquire Times-Mirror Co. for $6.5. billion, creating a
coast-to-coast media giant with 22 television stations, four radio
stations, a host of Internet properties and now, along with The
Chicago Tribune, three of the nation's best-known newspapers _ The
Los Angeles Times, The Baltimore Sun and Newsday in New York.
Newspapers around the country, including The New York Times, have
been moving toward the Web and have encouraged reporters to
contribute in other mediums, such as cable and network television.
</P>
<P>
   But at Tribune Co., the experiment is going full throttle, and
nowhere has this form of multimedia journalism been so deeply
melded into a newspaper culture.
</P>
<P>
   Here at the Tribune Tower, a new breed of supervisors,
``intergroup'' managers, are encouraging the various media
properties to work together.
</P>
<P>
   The company is breaking down the walls between television,
newspapers, radio and the Internet, coaching reporters to be
crossover contributors to promote other Tribune partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the ones leading the pack in multimedia journalism,''
said Tom Goldstein, dean of the Columbia Graduate School of
Journalism. ``Journalists of the future are going to have to know a
lot of things, and I think the Tribune Co. is ahead in that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Tribune executives say they fully expect the ``synergies''
between television and newspapers to reach their new properties in
New York and Los Angeles. Indeed, the company says, a driving
factor behind the acquisition of Times-Mirror Co. was that Tribune
Co. had television stations in Los Angeles and New York that could
be integrated into the operations of The Los Angeles Times and
Newsday.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Tribune executives have already suggested that KTLA, their
television station in Los Angeles, look into renovating the
newsroom of The Los Angeles Times to see whether it can find a home
there. And Raymond Jansen, the publisher of Newsday, said Tuesday
in the newspaper that Tribune Co.'s WPIX television station in New
York may develop ties with Newsday.
</P>
<P>
   One of the benefits of the new approach is significant cost
saving, the company said, because it allows television stations,
for example, to use Tribute reporters on the air, reducing their
costs. Internet sites are also able to keep their cost down by
using the reporters rather than hiring a separate staff.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At The Chicago Tribune newsroom, right in front of the editor's
office, is a new television studio, a short walk for reporters who
need to update their latest story. Cameras link to WGN television
and CLTV, the company's 24-hour cable station in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Other Tribune newspapers, such as The Orlando Sentinel in
Florida, are also equipped with television, video and Internet
equipment. Indeed, the entire Tribune newsroom is wired for
additional cameras and broadband Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   And the mantra here, among editors and executives alike, is
synergy. It comes when Skip Bayless, a Tribune sports columnist,
does weekly commentary on CLTV. Or when a newspaper reporter gives
a story to WGN Television; or when the WGN TV helicopter offers to
fly a Tribune photographer to a crash site; or when movie reviews
are repackaged on a company Web site called Metromix.com. Or when
the ``Good Eating'' section of the Tribune turns into an
award-winning food show on CLTV.
</P>
<P>
   Tribune executives say the idea is to get the story out in every
medium and reach as many people as possible, strengthening the
Tribune franchise.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The newspaper is the last great mass medium,'' said David
Underhill, a vice president at Tribune Co. ``But we need new ways
to reach light readers, nonreaders, people who don't buy newspapers
at all, and we need to find ways to reach people several times a
day.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some critics, worry that multimedia journalism could water down
daily reporting, spreading reporters too thin; or that the new
journalism is really a cover for journalism that surrenders to the
bottom line. They complain about bureau closings and resources
being shifted away from the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   There are also worries that Tribune Co., an early investor in
America Online, owner of the Chicago Cubs and Wrigley Field, and
part owner of the WB Network and the Food Network, is shifting its
priorities into entertainment and business. And that breaking the
walls down among media is going hand in hand with breaking the
walls down between, say, the advertising side and the news side.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem I have with this new journalism is that once they
change the culture, to be more team-oriented and to think in
business concerns, you get into problems,'' said Ken Auletta, who
wrote about Tribune Co. a few years ago in the American Journalism
Review. ``They also see using each division as a trampoline to
promote each other division. That's not journalism.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Chicago, Tribune reporters appear throughout the day on CLTV;
they appear on WGN and on the Web site. And often, they ask viewers
to look up their Web site or their radio show.
</P>
<P>
   Richards, after describing the Chicago Film Critics dinner on
WGN on Tuesday afternoon, invited viewers to listen into his radio
program this weekend, where they could hear the full audio from his
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``See he got his plug in for his radio show; it's all
playback,'' said Tom Garritano, who acts as a liaison between the
Tribune's different properties.
</P>
<P>
   Several Tribune journalists said they were troubled by aspects
of the format. For instance, they do not receive extra pay and they
are often asked to share information. They also said company seems
more profit driven.
</P>
<P>
   But Tribune executives emphasized that the company remains
committed to excellence, and continues to win major awards, like
the Pulitzer Prize. Besides, they say, some journalists love the
added exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Kendall, who covers the environment at The Tribune, said
the format offers more opportunities to get ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get a story and you believe in it, you want to get it
to as many venues as you can,'' he said. ``I think at the beginning
people did grouse a bit because they saw it as extra work. But now
I think they pretty much understand it's all part of the same
company. And once you break a story I don't know why it wouldn't be
everyone's impulse to broadcast it over as many media as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives say no one is forced to participate, but are
encouraged and even expected to make some contribution. The
multimedia aspects come up in performance reviews. And in the end,
those who contribute the most will be rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a funny way to pay by piecework, especially if you're in
journalism,'' said Jack Fuller, the president of Tribune
Publishing. ``If they're more valuable people, they'll get paid
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the critics of The Tribune's approach acknowledge that
newspapers need to branch out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you just think you're in the journalism business, you'll be
making the same mistake the railroad companies made. They thought
they were in the railroad business when they were in the
transportation business,'' Auletta said. ``So it's a good thing
trying to explore online ventures; that's the right way to go.''

-- Dr. William Haseltine in his lab at Human Genome Sciences, Inc.
Calling the effort to decode the human genome ``one of the most
significant scientific projects of all time, President Clinton and
Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain issued a joint statement
Tuesday saying the genome data ``should be made freely available to
scientists everywhere.'' Haseltine said he agreed with Tuesday's
statement because raw genomic data ``has no practical use,'' an
observation which he termed ``the biggest untold secret of the
human genome project.'' (Ann Grillo/The New York Times)

J. Craig Venter, president of Celera Genomics, leans on a gene
sequencer being installed to be used in decoding the human genome.
Calling the effort to decode the human genome ``one of the most
significant scientific projects of all time,'' President Clinton
and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain issued a joint statement
Tuesday saying the genome data ``should be made freely available to
scientists everywhere.'' The statement is a bureaucratic outgrowth
of the longstanding rivalry between a public consortium of American
and British academic centers and the Celera Corporation of
Rockville, Md, to complete the sequence of the human genome. (Marty

SCI-NO-INSURANCE-DOCS -- William Daniel in his home during a recent
interivew. Two years ago, Daniel's doctor accepted only cash for
his services and refused to deal with insurance companies.
Reluctantly, Daniel changed doctors only to find one that seemed
always pressed for time. So he changed back. For those with
insurance or the money to pay for health care, there is a
two-tiered system evolving. One tier is made up of doctors who take
insurance, the other offers doctors with time and attention to give
but take only cash. (Edward Carreon/The New York Times)

despite double-checking the fine print for any previously
undisclosed fees, the mortage company First Alliance added $13,000
in fees to her loan which was designed to rise a full percentage
point every six months. The Gundersons, who had to work extra hours
to make ends meet, are among scores of consumers who have
complained to state regulators about First Alliance, a national

CITING HEALTH RISK, EPA CUTS SULFUR IN DIESEL FUEL
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Environmental Protection Agency has decided to
sharply reduce the level of sulfur allowed in diesel fuel, calling
diesel emissions an important health hazard.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of a new rule, which will probably be announced in
a few months, has opened a vigorous debate between the oil industry
and state officials, not about whether to cut sulfur levels, but
how much.
</P>
<P>
   State air pollution officials plan to release a report on
Wednesday contending that soot from diesel engines increases the
cancer risk so that after a lifetime of exposure there would be
125,000 extra cases around the country. Sulfur in fuel clogs
emission controls on trucks and buses, so they are prodigious
producers of soot and of nitrogen oxides, which cause smog.
</P>
<P>
   The state officials want a 97 percent cut. S. William Becker,
executive director of the State and Territorial Air Pollution
Program Administrators, the group releasing the report, noted that
the EPA assessment of the cancer risk from diesel exhaust is
``between `likely' and `highly likely.' This stuff is bad for
you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are dozens of chemicals as part of diesel particulates
that are bad for you, that are causing cancer, aggravating asthma,
and other ailments,'' Becker said.
</P>
<P>
   But the refiners said Tuesday that the technology to produce
such clean fuel did not exist, and that even if it did, the cost
would drive some refineries out of business and that would create
shortages for all oil products. The industry acknowledges
``concern'' over the health effects of diesel emissions, said
Edward H. Murphy, a spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute,
the trade group, which has volunteered to reduce the sulfur limit
to 90 percent of the current peak. But that reduction will cost 5
or 6 cents a gallon, he said, and going down to 97 percent could
cost an additional 10 to 12 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The federal environmental agency plans to release a proposal in
the next few months ordering cuts in the amount of sulfur, capped
since 1993 at 500 parts per million. Murphy's group has volunteered
that in addition to an absolute limit of 50 parts per million, the
national average would be 30; Becker wants a cap of 15.
</P>
<P>
   No one doubts that a cut is coming. ``Diesel sulfur levels need
to be significantly reduced,'' said Urvan R. Sternfels, president
of the National Petroleum Refiners Association, another industry
group.
</P>
<P>
   David Cohen, a spokesman for the EPA, said his agency had ``put
out no hard numbers'' about what it would propose, but he added,
``it has long been our position that particulate emissions,
including diesel, represent a major threat to public health and the
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   But considerable doubt exists on just how big a threat the
exhaust is. The state air pollution officials developed their
estimate of cancer cases by drawing from a draft report prepared by
a California agency, the South Coast Air Quality Management
District, an influential agency that is often first to set
standards that spread nationwide. The California agency said that
90 percent of the cancer risk in the Los Angeles area came from
buses, trucks and cars, and that 70 percent of the risk was
attributable to diesel particulates.
</P>
<P>
   The extrapolation by the state group assumes that urban and
suburban areas around the United States have half as much soot as
Los Angeles, and that rural areas have one-tenth as much.
</P>
<P>
   But the California agency is one of the few to try to express a
numerical relationship between diesel soot in the air and cancer
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel S. Greenbaum, president of the Health Effects Institute,
an independent scientific organization in Cambridge, Mass.,
financed jointly by the EPA and various heavy industries, said that
most studies were more cautious. ``If you look across all the
public agencies that have reviewed the scientific data you see some
consistency in them saying the diesel is either a probable human
carcinogen or likely to be a human carcinogen,'' Greenbaum said,
``but that's one step below saying it's a known human carcinogen.''
</P>
<P>
   The EPA said in 1996 that diesel exhaust was ``highly likely''
to be carcinogenic when inhaled.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA's rule making is running up against two other factors.
One is the recent spike in the price of diesel fuel.
</P>
<P>
   But ``everything today is caught up in the rhetoric of gas
prices going up, and how we can't afford to do anything,'' Becker
said.
</P>
<P>
   The other is that the refineries already have a lot of other
government-mandated work to do. Sternfels, of the refiners'
association, pointed out that a separate EPA rule, announced in
December, cuts the allowable sulfur content of gasoline by 90
percent. Refiners cannot implement both rules at once, he said.

GENERAL WHOSE TIME RAN OUT: TIMES MIRROR'S WILLES SOUGHT TO STRETCH
LIMITS
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif.; Texas; Colo.; Ga.)   (See also TRIBUNE-CHICAGO)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Joshua, the Biblical general, is best remembered for commanding
the sun to stand still. Canute, who ruled England early in the 11th
century, is best remembered for commanding the tide to recede.
Years hence, when the purchase by the Tribune Co. of the Times
Mirror Co. is old news, Mark H. Willes, Times Mirror's last chief
executive, may best be remembered for declaring that his flagship
newspaper's circulation could increase by 500,000 _ a figure
greater than the total circulation of all but 10 American
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Legend has it that Joshua got his way and Canute did not. Willes
had achieved one-tenth of his goal before Times Mirror's Chandler
family sold the business out from under him. Whatever the legends
eventually say, circulation figures for The Los Angeles Times' so
far indicate his command will prove as futile as Canute's.
</P>
<P>
   Such numbers, however, cannot measure the impact of Willes'
effort to stretch the limits of the possible.
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure, executives came and went through the
revolving doors of the imposing Times Mirror building with alarming
regularity. Strategies, too, came and went. Newspapers were closed,
businesses sold, hundreds of employees laid off and costs cut,
leaving a trail of bitter bystanders.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the detritus and the rampant skepticism about his goals and
tactics, Willes pushed a drifting institution _ and the hidebound
industry to which it belonged _ to question its basic assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Smith, president of the Atlanta-based Cox newspapers, said
on Tuesday that ``Mark suffered from not coming out of a newspaper
experience, in terms of finding the occasional wrong way to say
something, the wrong words to use. But if you listened carefully
and stripped that away,'' he said, Willes was raising the most
important issues facing the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was tremendously impressed by the passion this man brought
to the business,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Willes, 58, first articulated his passion for reinventing the
newspaper business shortly after he was named chief executive at
Times Mirror in the spring of 1995. But it was articulated in
executive terms: He completed the previously planned closing of The
Baltimore Evening Sun; closed the 10-year-old New York Newsday and
sold or closed some cable and media operations.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,200 people lost their jobs so that, as Willes said
in October 1995, ``We were sinking like a rock in a number of
places in the company,'' explaining the sweeping overhauls he had
undertaken. In 1995, only the $1.6 billion gained in the sale of
its cable business kept the company in the black.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, however, gave his strategy high marks, as the price
of Times Mirror shares rose 80 percent by the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Cutbacks and the sale of businesses continued to be Willes'
leitmotif throughout his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   This trend, which began before Willes arrived _ Times Mirror had
already shed newspapers in Dallas and Denver and sold its cable
business _ has left the company with seven newspapers, an
navigational and aeronautical publisher, and a stable of magazines
including Golf Digest and Field and Stream.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate discipline was the passion Willes brought to Times
Mirror. The board rewarded the subsequent financial success with
repeated grants of stock and options, which according to the
company's March 1999 proxy, were worth at least $43 million, not
counting the value of options.
</P>
<P>
   But he developed a new passion after he named himself publisher
of The Los Angeles Times in October 1997. Within weeks, he declared
his new circulation goals in an interview with The Wall Street
Journal. In subsequent interviews with outside reporters, he would
throw out his idea of the moment for pumping up circulation _
attracting women by publishing articles that were ```more
emotional, more personal, less analytical,'' or starting a separate
section for Latino news.
</P>
<P>
   The ideas, many later abandoned, demonstrated Willes'
willingness to flout conventional wisdom. They also flouted
journalists' sensitivities.
</P>
<P>
   When he suggested tying editors' compensation to the number of
women and minorities quoted in the articles they handled, a St.
Petersburg Times editorial cautioned: ``Purposely manipulating news
sources in order to satisfy diversity goals is a good way to
undermine the credibility of a newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Still, there were four basic ideas that he never abandoned. One
was pairing editors with marketers and advertising sales
representatives in every department, to make The Times more
entrepreneurial and profitable. A second was planning some coverage
with direct goals in mind _ most notably in the ``Reading By Nine''
program to improve literacy among elementary schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Third, Willes' desire to reach out to minority communities and
raise circulation in minority neighborhoods, led to the creation of
a special Latino desk, with 13 reporters, and to partnership
arrangements with four small newspapers _ Korea Times, the
Spanish-language newspaper La Opinion, the Chinese Daily News and
the Rafu Shimpo, a publication aimed at the Japanese community.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he redeployed the reporting and editing resources. He
added space and 11 new reporters to the business section, added a
foreign bureau in Vietnam. The newsroom work force remains about
1,000 _ with one major change. About 200 of the reporters work for
15 small regional papers, called Our Times, which offer local news
about schools and traffic in the disparate regions of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Over his 19 months as publisher, the newspaper's financial
performance faltered, and his idea of editorial-business
cooperation foundered. Executives left in droves. Profits dipped
below expectations. Members of the Times Mirror board openly
questioned the wisdom of Willes filling the roles of chief
executive and Times publisher. In June last year, he turned over
the publisher's reins to Kathryn M. Downing.
</P>
<P>
   The financial picture began to brighten.
</P>
<P>
   High-margin classified advertising, which had apparently been
leaching away to the Internet, returned. The performance of The
Times began to catch up to the company's East Coast newspapers.
Advertising volume at The Times grew 13.4 percent in 1999 over the
previous year, better than the 4.9 percent increase at the East
Coast newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Monday, Willes said: ``My heartache is that
all the things we've been doing on the East Coast have been paying
off for four years. Out here at The Times they are just now paying
off. It's frankly an enormous personal disappointment that I didn't
have a couple of more years to let everybody see how profound the
changes have been and how strong the base is on which we're
growing.''
</P>
<P>
   But while he was attending to corporate issues and focusing on
the company's Internet initiatives, Downing, an enthusiastic
disciple, made the deal to share revenue from one magazine issue
with a downtown arena, the Staples Center _ the subject of the
magazine's coverage.
</P>
<P>
   With the newspaper's credibility under siege and its journalists
in revolt, Willes' vision of revolutionizing the business seemed
irrevocably tarnished.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Richard A. Oppel, the editor of The Austin American-Statesman,
said Tuesday: ``The Willes leadership has had effects on the
culture of journalism. Some are good. The newspaper is more
innovative and entrepreneurial.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``A lot of us were heartened to hear a publisher say
we're going to increase circulation by 500,000. That spirit should
live and I'd like to see the underlying strategies that make it
work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The great challenge of the newspaper CEO,'' Oppel added, ``is
understanding that balance between innovation and preservation of
enduring values. The person who casts out the latter has no chance
of sustaining the credibility of a modernized, updated newspaper.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton and Prime Minister Tony Blair of the United
Kingdom said Tuesday that the sequence of the human genome should
be made freely available to all researchers, leading to a sharp
selloff in the stocks of biotechnology companies that hope to
profit by creating drugs based on genetic data.
</P>
<P>
   The White House quickly said that it did not intend to hurt the
fledgling biotechnology industry, but investors who have made
biotechnology stocks the darlings of the market were unconvinced.
In frantic selling, they wiped away tens of billions of dollars in
market value from the industry. Genomics companies, which are
racing to produce a database of human DNA, were hit hardest, with
some off more than 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The drop was not confined to the biotechnology sector. After
briefly passing 5000 in morning trading, the Nasdaq composite
index, which is heavily weighted in technology stocks, fell
steadily. The index closed at 4706.63, down 200.61 points, its
second-largest point loss ever.
</P>
<P>
   For investors, the drop is noteworthy, because biotechnology and
Internet companies have led the stock market so far this year,
while most other stocks have languished. Despite falling almost 13
percent Tuesday, the Nasdaq biotech index remains up almost 30
percent this year, thanks to investors' belief that a new wave of
drug discovery and gene therapy is imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the rapid runup, the stocks are pricey by all
traditional valuations. The joint statement from Clinton and Blair,
which said that the genome data ``should be made freely available
to scientists everywhere,'' served as a spark for excitable
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Whitfield, chief executive of Incyte Pharmaceuticals, which
shed 28 percent of its market value during the day, said that
investors failed to distinguish between genome sequences and gene
sequences. The genome, referring to the total human DNA, has no
commercial value in itself and cannot be patented. The genes, which
occupy only 3 percent of the genome, can be. Researchers can work
on the sequences of patented genes in academic work and have to pay
license fees only if they wish to sell some invention based on the
sequence.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders' statement, which was eight months in the
making, is a bureaucratic outgrowth of the longstanding rivalry
between a public consortium of American and British academic
centers and Celera Corp. of Rockville, Md., to complete the
sequence of the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium, largely funded by the federal National
Institutes of Health and the Wellcome Trust of London, is posting
its findings daily on a Web site open to all. Celera promises to
make its version of the human genome freely available when it is
finished, probably this summer. Celera plans to patent some genes,
but its principal business plan is to operate a database of the
human and other genomes, charging fees for use of the programs that
search and analyze the genetic data.
</P>
<P>
   The statement was intended simply to codify the government
position in the rivalry _ that the human genome sequence should be
made publicly available to all researchers _ but appears to have
been interpreted as a challenge both to Celera's intellectual
property rights and to those of other genome and biotech companies.
</P>
<P>
   A White House official said neither challenge was intended,
noting that the statement explicitly endorsed intellectual property
protection for patents based on genes.
</P>
<P>
   The statement cuts across a complicated two-way rivalry between
the public consortium and Celera, and between Celera and its two
chief rivals, Incyte Pharmaceuticals and Human Genomes Sciences.
Both the consortium and Celera aim to sequence the human genome,
which means determining the order of the 3 billion chemical units
in the DNA, the genetic information possessed by each human cell.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy of Incyte and Human Genome Sciences is to focus on
the genes themselves, patenting as many as possible. The genes, the
programming instructions that operate the cell, are hidden in the
DNA, with no obvious signposts, and are hard to find even when the
genome sequence is known.
</P>
<P>
   The government statement adds to the tension between the public
consortium and Celera, which last week announced they had
effectively broken off merger negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Celera and its president, J. Craig Venter, have long been at
odds with the leading scientists of the public consortium, chiefly
Dr. John Sulston of the Sanger Center in Britain and Dr. Robert
Waterston of Washington University in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Before merger talks broke off, the public consortium proposed
that both sides abandon what it called ``the current antagonism and
excessive competition.''
</P>
<P>
   The initiative for the statement issued Tuesday is believed to
have come from the Wellcome Trust. Michael Dexter, Wellcome's
director, said the trust's concern was over the general ownership
of the genome, which in his view ``is mankind's and should not be
owned by any one company, individual or country.''
</P>
<P>
   Denying that the statement was aimed at any person or company,
he said the raw sequence _ the string of chemical units making up
the genome _ was not patentable and that the trust ``would fight
any patents based on sequence if they obstruct academic work and
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Venter, however, indicated that he thought Celera was a target
of the statement, but unfairly so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are puzzled by the statement and we think it represents the
lack of insight and the confusion that has been generated out
there. Our business is not in patenting the genome or tying it
up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Venter reiterated his previous position that Celera would make
available the sequence of the human genome when it was finished,
and said the onus was on rivals Incyte and Human Genome Sciences to
make their data public. ``I agree with the president and Tony Blair
that Incyte and HGS should publish their data,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Dexter and Rachel E. Levinson, a senior official at the
White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said the joint
statement acknowledged intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
   Levinson said nothing in the statement changed existing patent
law. She said she was ``very concerned and upset'' about the
reactions on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Neal Lane, the White House science adviser, said the
statement would not affect Celera because of Celera's known intent
to publish the human genome sequence, Levinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Haseltine, the chief executive of Human Genome
Sciences, said his company's data was being published through the
patent system. When a patent is issued, the underlying invention is
fully described.
</P>
<P>
   Haseltine said he agreed with Tuesday's statement because raw
genomic data ``has no practical use,'' an observation that he
termed ``the biggest untold secret of the human genome project.''
When researchers with the public consortium published the first DNA
sequence of a human chromosome in December last year, he said, ``No
new medical discoveries were made and no new genes were found.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason, he added, is that the computer programs for finding
genes are still far less efficient than the method pursued by his
company, one based on short DNA sequences called ``expressed
sequence tags,'' or ESTs.
</P>
<P>
   The EST approach exploits the fact that humans may not be able
to spot the genes in the genome but human cells surely can. They
regularly make transcripts of the genes whose information is needed
to synthesize the cell's various proteins. Researchers can capture
and analyze these transcripts, known as messenger RNAs, and from
just a small portion of their sequence can identify the
corresponding part of the gene from which they come. These little
snippets of genes, the ESTs, are the basis of gene-searching
approaches used by Human Genome Sciences and Incyte.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Patent and Trademark Office has issued some patents
based on ESTs alone, any such patents seem likely to be weaker than
patents based on the full-length genes.
</P>
<P>
   According to figures released by Human Genome Sciences, Incyte
leads in the human gene patent race with 353 U.S. patents issued,
followed by Human Genome Sciences (114 patents), SmithKline Beecham
(60), the US government (49), the University of California (46) and
Massachusetts General Hospital (45).
</P>
<P>
   There is still wide disagreement on the number of genes
contained in the human genome sequence. Both Dr. Randy Scott,
president of Incyte, and Haseltine estimate that there are 140,000
genes, double the number that Venter has favored.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the biotechnology companies have yet to prove their
ability to translate their research into revenues, much less
profits. Yet these stocks have helped drive the Nasdaq composite to
an 86 percent gain last year, the best performance by a major index
ever in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   By traditional valuation standards, the Nasdaq is
extraordinarily expensive, leaving some analysts worried that it is
overdue for a sharp drop. The average Nasdaq stock trades at well
over 100 times expected 2000 earnings, and some large Internet and
computer stocks trade at unheard-of price-earnings multiples of 500
or more.
</P>
<P>
   A drop in the biotech and computer high-fliers could shake the
broader stock market, which has already been rattled by the Federal
Reserve's recent increases in short-term interest rates, analysts
said. For the year, the Dow Jones industrial average is down more
than 14 percent, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index is off 7.5
percent, while the Nasdaq is up 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Cliggott, U.S. equities analyst at J.P. Morgan, called
the market ``very fragile'' because the stocks that are driving it
higher are already so expensive. ``We see the kinds of
price-earnings multiples that the Nasdaq's trading at as being
absolutely, positively unsustainable,'' said Cliggott, who turned
cautious in January.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, broader indexes followed the Nasdaq down. After
spending most of the day up, the S&AMP;P slipped 24.47 points to
1359.15, a 1.8 percent drop. The Dow industrials fell 135.89
points, or 1.4 percent, to 9811.24.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, analysts who have dared to be bearish have been
wrong for the last five years. Byron Wien, chief U.S. investment
strategist for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, noted that the Nasdaq is
very volatile and that investors might shrug off this decline as
simply a buying opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had bad days in the Nasdaq before, and they've snapped
right back,'' Wien said. ``What we have to see is whether the `buy
the dips' mentality is broken.''

COMMENTARY: HILLARY'S IRISH STEW _ STEP-DANCING AS FAST AS SHE CAN
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ I have never understood why gays fight so hard to
get into the St. Patrick's Day Parade on Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of wanting to go to an Irish parade, rather than having
to go, is mind-boggling.
</P>
<P>
   The mere tap-tap sound that signals the approach of
``Riverdance'' or a pack of wolfhounds in green doggy sweaters
fills me with dread.
</P>
<P>
   I am still haunted by the memory of waking up in St. Louis,
where the Ancient Order of Hibernians was holding a convention,
hearing the strains of ``When the Saints Go Marching In,'' and
running to the hotel window in time to watch, blushing in childish
embarrassment, as my parents led an Irish parade down the street.
</P>
<P>
   Now I find myself identifying with Christopher, the mafia
soldier in ``The Sopranos,'' who got shot and had a near-death
experience in which he learns that hell is an Irish bar called The
Emerald Piper where it's St. Patrick's Day every day.
</P>
<P>
   Coming cold into New York's trellis of unbelievably prickly
ethnics and minorities, Hillary Clinton stumbled into the dreary,
unending troubles over St. Patrick's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, she was asked if she would march in the Fifth
Avenue parade. Sure, she said gamely, apparently not realizing that
many Democrats boycott the parade because it excludes gay groups.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to mollify angry lesbian and gay groups, she then agreed
to march in an alternative parade in Queens County the Sunday
before last, in which participants could and did wear buttons that
said ``Kiss me, I'm queer'' and ``Fascist Giuliani.''
</P>
<P>
   I went to Queens to see how the candidate would fare. The parade
was a glum sight. Hillary marched down the street waving to a
sparse crowd, without the benefit of a band or even a boom box with
``McNamara's Band'' to liven things up. In front of her, a solemn
group representing Census 2000 trudged along.
</P>
<P>
   One guy on the sidelines was booing her, and another, an
Iranian, held up a sign with her picture that said: ``Not here. Not
now. Not ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Later she again defended her decision to march on Fifth Avenue,
after she got heckled speaking to the Gay and Lesbian Independent
Democrats in Greenwich Village. ``I have worked very hard over the
last six years or so in every way I could to further the peace
process in Northern Ireland,'' she said. Marching in the Hibernian
parade was ``one way of demonstrating that.''
</P>
<P>
   Her step-dancing among different groups is complicated by her
role as first lady. Just when we thought we were out, the Clintons
pull us back into their wacky marital deal.
</P>
<P>
   First it looked as if Bill was trying to help Hillary out on the
Puerto Rican terrorist clemency deal. Then Hillary tried to
capitalize on Bill's peace efforts in Northern Ireland, and
rationalize with them. Now Hillary has waded into yet another
ethnic kerfuffle with the Pakistanis, leaving the impression that
she might be influencing Bill's policy decisions for a pot of gold.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistani-Americans and Indian-Americans were watching his
decision whether to stop in Pakistan on his upcoming visit to the
Indian subcontinent. The Pakistani community encouraged the stop;
Indians staunchly opposed it. According to The New York Times'
Raymond Bonner, a group of Pakistani-American donors moved up the
date of a fund-raiser for Hillary so they could press her to
support the stop in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   They were told she would not appear unless they raised at least
$50,000. They prepared spicy goat curry, but she did not stay long
enough to eat. She told the donors she hoped her husband would go
to Pakistan. Last week he announced he would.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed about the story on Tuesday, Clinton said, ``If anybody
thinks they can influence the president by making a contribution to
me, they are dead wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Come again? If big spenders did not think they could influence
the president by currying favor with the first lady, then why did
Johnny Chung spend hours in the East Wing, gazing at pictures of
Hillary and waiting for brief audiences with her?
</P>
<P>
   Chung, who gave Clinton's aide, Maggie Williams, a check for
$50,000, compared the White House to a subway: ``You have to put in
the coins to open the gates.'' No blarney there.

<P>
   First Alliance Corp., a nationwide home-equity lender that has
come under legal attack for deceptive practices, says it charges
high fees because its borrowers have less-than-perfect credit
records and are more likely to default on their loans.
</P>
<P>
   But the company, based in Irvine, Calif., tells a different tale
to Wall Street. In documents intended to attract investors, it
points out that more than three-fourths of its loans are made to
people with relatively good credit histories.
</P>
<P>
   A former loan officer said the company makes little effort to
distinguish between customers with poor records and those with good
credit history, who would qualify for conventional loans.
</P>
<P>
   At First Alliance, ``customers with `A' credit would pay the
same high loan fees as customers with `D' credit,'' according to a
sworn affidavit by Greg Walling, a First Alliance
loan-officer-turned-whistleblower who has cooperated with various
state regulators. His suburban Minneapolis office was a few dozen
yards from a conventional branch bank, he said in a recent
interview. ``I wanted to tell some of my better customers that
every step they took from my door to that bank would save them
$1,000 on their loan.''
</P>
<P>
   He was not exaggerating. Court record show that the company has
charged loan origination fees, called ``points,'' of 25 percent or
more on some loans, in addition to high interest rates and big
penalties for early repayment.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Chisick, the company's founder and chief executive, said
the company had recently reduced its origination fees to an average
of about 10 percent because of what he called the ``sound-bite
effect of the high origination fees.''
</P>
<P>
   Few conventional lenders charge origination fees of more than
two points on a loan _ that is 2 percent of the total amount _ and
many state regulators consider fees of more than eight points to be
indefensible.
</P>
<P>
   For someone borrowing $100,000 from First Alliance, a fee of 25
points adds $25,000 to the amount on which the customer is paying
interest.
</P>
<P>
   The calculation has become all too familiar to Velda Durney, one
of the homeowners who have sued First Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Durney's brother built her sage-green ranch house in Fremont,
Calif., outside San Jose, in the summer of 1966. It is filled with
evidence of a life well lived: photographs of happy school-age
grandchildren, fresh-baked carrot cakes cooling in the kitchen, a
bowling trophy-laden sideboard, pushed aside to make room for a
quilting frame.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband died soon after the house was finished, and she
raised her six children there alone, working for 23 years as a
sales clerk at Sears. She managed on a small pension and Social
Security _ until August 1996, when she refinanced her home through
First Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Durney believed she had signed for an 8.5 percent
adjustable-rate mortgage for $51,493 that would consolidate a few
credit card bills and lower her total monthly payments. In fact,
after more than 26 points in fees were added, her loan was for
$64,590, and its rate was scheduled to climb every six months until
her monthly payments would equal or exceed her original mortgage
payments.
</P>
<P>
   Her income simply would not stretch that far, and she began to
have nightmares that she would lose her home.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about that loan in an interview in January, the capable
Durney slumped into a kitchen chair, tears suddenly spilling from
behind her stylish wire-framed glasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't talk about it without crying,'' she apologized. ``It
took away every shred of self-confidence I had.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides her peace of mind, she has also lost her privacy. She
had to refinance again to get a fixed-rate mortgage, and her
monthly payments are still bigger than her pension income will
cover. So she makes ends meet, she said, by renting out her two
spare bedrooms _ which she had done as a favor to church
acquaintances in the past but now does with strangers, by
necessity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting by,'' she said last week, ``but just barely.''
</P>
<P>
   Chisick said he could not comment extensively on the case
because it was still in litigation, but he denied wrongdoing. He
added, ``All borrowers are given two separate, three-day periods to
reject the terms of the obligation. She decided not to.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed and Joanne Pagter, who lived in nearby Santa Clara, had their
own money worries as 1996 began. Mr. Pagter, then 67, ran a
part-time pool maintenance business that added about $800 a month
to the $735 he got from Social Security. But he was suffering from
severe kidney disease and was unsure how long he would be able to
work. Mrs. Pagter, who earned just over $2,100 a month, was nearing
retirement from her job at a corporate cafeteria service.
</P>
<P>
   They had abundant equity in their home, but their main financial
problem was an adjustable-rate mortgage that was scheduled to
increase Jan. 1 unless they could replace it with a loan that
required lower monthly payments.
</P>
<P>
   First Alliance, which had been calling them on a weekly basis
for several years, assured them that they could. So in January
1996, the couple visited the company's San Jose office.
</P>
<P>
   According to a lawsuit they later filed, the Pagters told
Jeffrey E.A. Phillips, a First Alliance loan officer, that their
goal was to keep payments as low as possible for the next year so
that they could save more, and then to sell their home after Mrs.
Pagter retired and buy a house near their daughter, who lives in
Lemoore, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The Pagters say they were rushed through the closing, signing
documents they were not given time to read. Not until October 1996,
when they were selling their Santa Clara home and trying to close
on their new one, did they discover the exact terms of their loan,
according to their lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   They had actually borrowed $170,264 from First Alliance _
including an origination fee of 13 points, or $19,950 _ not
$147,000 as they believed. This decreased the equity they had in
their old home, so they had to borrow more money, and quickly, to
close on the new house.
</P>
<P>

 &UR; UNDATED: new house. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE COUNTERATTACK: Building a Case Against Deception
</P>
<P>
   Looking for help, the Pagters turned to Steinbock &AMP; Hofmann, a
three-person San Jose law firm that was already representing a
number of elderly homeowners with very similar complaints against
First Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The cases became the special passion of Sheila Canavan, the
firm's associate. Working on a shoestring _ and chided by friends
who saw parallels with the financially doomed lawyers in the movie
``A Civil Action'' _ the firm was representing five other
homeowners, all complaining of deceptive sales practices by First
Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, investigators in the state Department of
Financial Institutions in Olympia, Wash., had opened a file on
First Alliance, on the basis of 17 consumer complaints similar to
those made by Durney and the Pagters.
</P>
<P>
   State officials immediately focused on a 1996 version of the
Track, the sales script that the company's loan officers used in
their dealings with customers. In June 1997, in an affidavit filed
in state court, the lead investigator, Chuck Cross, observed that
First Alliance's intent ``appears to be to continually play down
the import of certain disclosures, misdirect crucial information or
confuse the borrower about what they are actually obtaining in the
transaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Cross was especially concerned that the script borrowed terms
from the federal disclosure documents, like ``amount financed,''
and gave them new and misleading definitions. Loan origination fees
were never called ``points,'' he said, but instead ``prepaid
finance charges,'' or ``minimum finance charges.'' And they were
labeled estimates when they were actually firm amounts.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators in other states sought copies of that 1996 sales
script, but First Alliance obtained a court order requiring
Washington regulators to keep the document secret _ an order that
remains in place today. (Last March, First Alliance notified the
state that it intended to sue Cross and his superiors for
defamation.)
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1997, Canavan and her partners in San Jose had
filed lawsuits against First Alliance on behalf of the Pagters,
Durney and four other area homeowners. The company mounted an
aggressive defense, insisting that all the terms on the loans had
been fully and clearly disclosed. Company lawyers pointed out that
by signing closing statements, borrowers had attested to fully
understanding the terms of their loans.
</P>
<P>
   Several borrowers in the lawsuit said they had signed the forms
in a rush, without having had time to examine them carefully.
Others said they had been advised to ignore information in the
forms that differed from what they had been told by a loan officer.
Still others said they had been assured that the information was in
error and would be corrected, or depicted a worst-case scenario
that was unlikely to arise.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Pagter case in San Jose began to inch toward
trial. The company tried to shunt the case off to arbitration, but
a state appeals court, in a crucial ruling, concluded that the
elderly couple's signature on a form agreeing to forgo lawsuits had
been `` obtained by fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   In the decision, the court sharply criticized First Alliance,
which it said had ``trained its employees to use various methods,
including deception, to sell its services.''
</P>
<P>
   In his written response, Chisick called the ruling ``incorrect''
and ``a blatant error.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, in February 1999, gave the Pagters hope, but
settlement discussions with First Alliance dragged through 1999 and
broke off inconclusively early this year. It was not until a day
after a jury had been chosen for a January trial in San Jose that
First Alliance agreed to pay an undisclosed sum to settle the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed and I used to joke that they were just waiting for us all
to die,'' said Mrs. Pagter. The joke was prophetic. Ed Pagter died
last October.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why First Alliance had delayed a settlement for so long,
given Mr. Pagter's ill health, Chisick said, ``Mr. Pagter was ill
when he borrowed the money, so the advancement of his illness was
not a factor.''
</P>
<P>
   GROWING OPPOSITION: Picking Up Allies With Influence  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even an attentive Wall Street investment banker might have
missed the early local headlines critical of First Alliance. But
the company's legal troubles attracted national attention in May
1998, when the Pagters and their fellow plaintiffs gained a
powerful new ally in their fight: the giant AARP.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Constantine Davis, a staff lawyer, said the AARP had been
approached by Canavan's firm and ``decided this was definitely
something we wanted to look into.''
</P>
<P>
   The organization was taking advantage of an unusual facet of
California's business laws, called Section 17200, that allows a
plaintiff to sue as a ``private attorney general,'' seeking
restitution on behalf of all citizens affected by certain deceptive
business practices.
</P>
<P>
   State regulators, too, were heading to court. By the end of
1998, Minnesota Attorney General Hubert H. Humphrey III had sued
First Alliance, accusing it of deceptive sales practices. In
Massachusetts, an assistant attorney general, Pamela S. Kogut, had
obtained a temporary injunction forcing the company to limit its
origination fees to eight points _ although a top company executive
had argued in court that the company could not make a profit with
fees that low. And in Illinois, Attorney General Jim Ryan was suing
as well, seeking remedies that included the rescission of all the
loans First Alliance has made there.
</P>
<P>
   Steve LeClair, an assistant attorney general in Florida, says
that his staff has subpoenaed a ``very large volume of records''
and is talking with First Alliance ``to see if this is something we
can resolve without filing a formal complaint.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida's primary concern is the origination fees. ``They're
just so excessively high that it's hard for me to conceive of any
way a consumer would agree to that kind of loan if all the facts
have been put before them,'' LeClair said.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, after years of legal fencing with First Alliance,
Washington state regulators finally filed a formal complaint
against the company, seeking to suspend its license for two years
and to obtain an order that it discontinue deceptive practices.
</P>
<P>
   And in September, First Alliance agreed to settle the consumer
protection lawsuits filed against it in Minnesota. While
acknowledging no wrongdoing, the company agreed to offer each of
its Minnesota customers $4,000 to $6,000 and to read any new
customers a simple court-ordered description of its fees and rates
before any loan discussions began.
</P>
<P>
   Prentiss Cox, a Minnesota assistant attorney general, said the
company no longer did business in his state. ``That kind of relief
suggests the strength of our allegations in the case.''
</P>
<P>
   But at best, regulatory efforts like Minnesota's can only
protect a statewide segment of consumers; companies can
short-circuit such investigations simply by pulling out of one
state and moving into another. Some states have strong, clear
consumer lending laws and well-financed regulatory agencies _ but
others do not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-FIRST-ALLIANCE-SERIES-II-ART-3RDTAKE-NYT &QL; 
UNDATED: do not. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The early waves of scandal from the subprime industry a decade
ago prompted Congress in 1994 to adopt legislation requiring
greater disclosure by high-cost lenders, but federal action to
enforce those laws has been rare. Indeed, the Federal Trade
Commission filed the first disciplinary cases under the 1994 law
just last summer.
</P>
<P>
   And yet none of these legal problems seems to shake Wall
Street's faith in First Alliance or most of the other large
subprime lenders that have been the targets of consumer advocates'
complaints. To be sure, the high-yield mortgage market grew a bit
jittery in late 1998, after revelations of some subprime lenders'
questionable accounting practices. But last year, there were more
than 200 separate deals totaling more than $75 billion _ less than
in 1998 but more than in any other previous year.
</P>
<P>
   THE WALL STREETERS: Raising Money In the Best Circles  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No Wall Street investment bank had a bigger share of that
reviving 1999 market than Lehman Brothers, Wall Street's
fourth-largest brokerage house and one of its oldest and most
prestigious names.
</P>
<P>
   First Alliance's initial public offering in 1996 was handled by
Friedman Billings &AMP; Ramsey, a small investment bank based in
Arlington, Va. But through the late 1990s, First Alliance had
raised money through a variety of bigger banks and brokerage
houses, including Prudential Securities. Then about two years ago,
as the AARP lawsuit was added to First Alliance's legal troubles,
Lehman Brothers became the company's primary source of financing.
In all, it has handled eight separate deals for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman Brothers has not only helped raise money for First
Alliance despite its mounting legal troubles but, more recently,
has taken a small investment stake in the firm.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ahearn, the Lehman spokesman, pointed out that the brokerage
house's deals for First Alliance ``have been relatively small''
compared with Lehman's deals for other companies. And he emphasized
that all of First Alliance's mounting legal troubles were carefully
reviewed by Lehman and fully disclosed to investors who bought the
notes backed by First Alliance mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Nor did First Alliance's legal difficulties dissuade another
important Wall Street supporter: MBIA Insurance, the giant
financial insurance company, which has stood behind many of First
Alliance's loan deals over the years, guaranteeing that principal
and interest will be paid to investors promptly. With MBIA's
backing, First Alliance's mortgage-backed notes were awarded Wall
Street's highest credit ratings, making them more attractive to
institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Legan, a managing director of MBIA, said that his company
became increasingly concerned last year about the problem of
predatory lending in the subprime market and that it had recently
expanded the scope of its review of each subprime deal it agreed to
insure.
</P>
<P>
   First Alliance is one of the lenders that have come under
greater scrutiny, Legan confirmed. The insurer's lawyers have
reviewed the litigation against the company, he explained, and a
major accounting firm conducted ``a very extensive review at the
operational level.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Legan declined to say what records had been examined for the
assessment, but said: ``We have not uncovered evidence that they
are engaged in predatory lending.''
</P>
<P>
   MBIA's review does not appear to have included interviews with
the lawyers or regulators suing First Alliance. Neither Canavan in
San Jose nor regulators in other states can recall any inquiry from
MBIA lawyers _ or anyone else on Wall Street _ about the strength
of the evidence against First Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   State regulators' investigations of the company have focused
thus far on its deceptive sales practices and have not yet examined
where and how its money was raised.
</P>
<P>
   Some legal theorists believe that Lehman and other banks that
finance the industry can be held accountable under the law passed
by Congress in 1994. It holds that a borrower's legal claims
against his or her original lender can also be asserted against any
subsequent purchasers of the loan. Some state laws may also provide
a weapon, according to experts who cite a well-established legal
principle in most states: those who knowingly finance illegal
behavior can be held liable for it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ahearn said that Lehman says it has fulfilled its
legal responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   The current system ``is perfect for washing everybody's hands of
any responsibility,'' said Joshua Zinner, coordinator of a
foreclosure prevention project at South Brooklyn Legal Services.
``At each step, it gets harder and harder to hold anybody
accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   The subprime lenders trade group, meanwhile, is ``very, very
concerned'' about the ``few rogue lenders'' who give the industry a
bad name, said Zeltzer, the group's executive director. He
explained that the group's board has recently adopted an industry
code of ethics and voluntary standards that it hopes will prevent
deceptive or unfair lending practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not very happy headlines,'' Zeltzer said. ``This is
not how we want to do business.'' He added that Wall Street's
financing of the ``bad apples'' as well as the good ones did not
``make our job any easier.''

BLACK ACTORS: LOCKED DOWN OR LOCKED OUT  
 RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 19) 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Please note subslug for BLACK-MALES-OSCAR)  
(af) 
 By ELVIS MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been nearly 40 years since the first time an
African-American man won the best-actor Oscar. And in the long,
parched stretch of desert since the night Sidney Poitier got the
statuette for his 1963 starring role in ``Lilies of the Field,'' no
other black male has received an Oscar for best actor.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, if you were a black man looking for an Oscar nomination,
you had to go to prison. Both of this year's nominees, Denzel
Washington in the best-actor category for ``The Hurricane'' and
Michael Clarke Duncan in the best-supporting group for ``The Green
Mile,'' spend time as convicts in their films.
</P>
<P>
   And a pattern emerges in the Oscar nominations received by
African-American actors in films released in the last decade:
Washington as Rubin Carter in ``The Hurricane'' and in the title
role of ``Malcolm X''; Duncan in ``The Green Mile''; Morgan Freeman
in ``The Shawshank Redemption'' and ``Seven''; Samuel L. Jackson
for ``Pulp Fiction''; Laurence Fishburne for ``What's Love Got to
Do With It?''; Cuba Gooding Jr., winner of the supporting-actor
Oscar for ``Jerry Maguire.'' Five of the eight nominations are for
performances in which the men play criminals.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the odds seem to be in Denzel Washington's favor for
``Hurricane,'' though if he wins it could be seen as a consolation
award for his Malcolm, one of the best performances of the 1990s.
As Malcolm, he embodied, to use a phrase Kenneth Tynan once affixed
to a Laurence Olivier performance, ``a panther among doves.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, he portrayed the anguish of passing from the hell
of unfocused anger, through the purgatory of alienation and prison
and into the heaven of self-awareness. Malcolm is not made a better
man by love, either. He's surly and intransigent; he has just
learned to focus his deeply analytical mind on his passion, and his
people.
</P>
<P>
   Even in ``Hurricane,'' Washington blunts the film's slightly
condescending, old-school-liberal slant by playing Carter as a man
with a disharmonious emotional core: he couldn't get through a day
without a sneer if he tried. (Part of the reason Washington's
performance is so notable is that he's the closest thing to a
character in the movie; everyone else stands around and watches him
emote, or, in the case of the racist cops, glares at him as he
emotes.)
</P>
<P>
   Such wrong-side-of-the-track roles offer actors the opportunity
to flash the outlaw swagger that audiences have come to expect of
black men in the movies. That's certainly the case for Washington,
who in ``Hurricane'' has burned himself down to sinew and
willpower. His physical arrogance makes the performance a star
turn.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan makes up for what he lacks in technique with comfort and
sheer size. A dark-skinned giant emasculated by his runny goodness,
Duncan's John Cooley is the sacrificial black man who dies for the
sins of others; his initials are J.C., in case you miss the point.
</P>
<P>
   He's serving time in 1935 in a Southern prison in which the
death row guards are so forward thinking _ they reject violence and
racism _ that it's surprising they haven't found time to establish
Amnesty International. (It's this attempt to make them sympathetic
that pushes ``The Green Mile'' across the boundary between a movie
about racism and a vaguely racist movie.)
</P>
<P>
   In choosing to play dangerous characters rather than model
citizens, Duncan and Washington were merely exercising an actor's
desire to score with a memorable role _ just as Fishburne, Freeman
and Jackson had. Indeed, Fishburne is said to have revised the role
of the scarifying Ike Turner because the material was too
one-dimensional.
</P>
<P>
   Why would anyone demand that black actors play only role models?
It turns actors off, and would ring in a double standard for them:
the challenge is not to find paragons to play but to find roles
that offer complexity.
</P>
<P>
   Academy voters seem to have a soft spot for bad boys of all
races: white actors won Oscars in the '90s for playing an
unrepentant drunk (Nicolas Cage in ``Leaving Las Vegas''), a
wheedling serial killer (Anthony Hopkins in ``Silence of the
Lambs'') and a charmer who might be a killer (Jeremy Irons in
``Reversal of Fortune'').
</P>
<P>
   The other best-actor Oscars favored injured characters who just
wanted to be better men and had to suffer for it: Tom Hanks in
``Philadelphia'' and ``Forrest Gump''; Geoffrey Rush in ``Shine'';
Jack Nicholson in ``As Good as It Gets.'' This penchant of the
academy's was savaged in last summer's comedy ``Bowfinger,'' when
Eddie Murphy's paranoid action star demanded that his agent find
him Oscar bait: ``a retarded slave.''
</P>
<P>
   The joke may have been an offhand reference to the 1989
``Glory,'' in which Denzel Washington won a best-supporting-actor
Oscar for playing an insolent escaped slave attached to a Union
regiment in the Civil War. The academy doesn't seem ready to look
to younger actors, who tend not to play the black man dropping his
shackles and standing tall to reclaim his humanity, an archetype
that now borders on stereotype.
</P>
<P>
   In last year's ``Best Man,'' the fluid Terrence Howard brought
some vitality to a middle-class wedding comedy. And Taye Diggs,
showing a ridiculous amount of aplomb in ``Go,'' was the brother
schooling his posse in how to show that they're off-white rather
than white.
</P>
<P>
   Delroy Lindo, who's not as young, was one of the few
participants in ``The Cider House Rules'' not to get the big Oscar
push from Miramax, despite a tidy, finely wrought performance that
cried out for tribute.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, don't miss any sleep waiting to see the second black
woman pick up a best-actress Oscar: the first has yet to arrive.
The '90s saw only one black woman, Angela Bassett, earn a
best-actress nomination. And the only black woman to win an acting
Oscar for a '90s movie was Whoopi Goldberg, in ``Ghost.'' Will we
wait another 40 years before the penitentiary walls that exclude
African-American women come down?

OPENING THE WORLD'S EYES TO THE STRUGGLES OF IRAN  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 19)

 Nancy Ramsey's most recent article for Arts &AMP; Leisure was about the
Russian director Aleksei Guerman.  
 
 By NANCY RAMSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a sunny Friday afternoon last fall, the director
Majid Majidi, in town for the New York Film Festival from his
native Tehran, was in demand. Negotiations for the American
distribution of his latest film, ``The Color of Paradise,'' which
opens March 31, were under way.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week reporters had been talking with him about
Iranian films, about why they are so often about children (many of
the directors worked with the state-sponsored Institute for the
Intellectual Development of Children and Young Adults) and what it
is like making films under censorship (it has eased up in the last
two years).
</P>
<P>
   By Friday, Majidi was in Cliffside, N.J., at the home of a
friend, Jamsheed Akrami, a professor of film and television at
William Paterson University in Wayne, who was interviewing him for
a documentary. Looking out over a sparkling Hudson River at
Manhattan, Majidi fielded calls on a portable phone as Akrami
instructed a student to videotape him from first one angle, then
another.
</P>
<P>
   The festival circuit is nothing new to this soft-spoken,
sad-eyed 40-year-old director. His last film, ``Children of
Heaven,'' was the first Iranian film ever nominated for an Academy
Award. (``Life is Beautiful'' won.) But it is hard not to notice
the striking difference between the glossy festival world and the
worlds Majidi portrays in his films of rural and urban Iran, of
impoverished families, of parent-child struggles that erupt beneath
the surface of strict Islamic codes of behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children of Heaven'' had a simple narrative. A poor young boy
is sent to the market to retrieve his sister's pink shoes from a
cobbler. He sets the shoes down, and they are picked up by a blind
peddler. Returning home, the boy admonishes his sister not to tell
their father, and the two concoct a scheme for sharing the boy's
one pair of sneakers, each day racing through Tehran's alleys to
make the trade-off.When the pink shoes are found, they are on the
feet of the peddler's daughter, and the siblings understand that
that family is even worse off than their own.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Color of Paradise'' (it was called ``The Color of
Heaven'' at the New York festival), the main character, a young boy
named Mohammad (played by Mohsen Ramezani), is blind. To research
the film, Majidi visited schools for the blind and watched the
children interact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very little in the script was born of my imagination,'' he
said. To cast the film, Majidi took four blind boys on a trip to
rural northern Iran. Two had grown up in the desert (including
Ramezani) and had ``no concept of the sea, of birds, of the
jungle,'' said Majidi. ``Whenever we went to a new location, they'd
say, `We want to see it.' That meant touching, and they'd use the
word `beautiful' to describe what they had touched. At a riverbank,
the boy who plays Mohammad started reading the pebbles, making rock
formations in Braille.''
</P>
<P>
   The film opens in Tehran, where Mohammad attends a school for
the blind, and moves to the countryside, where he is to spend the
summer with his widowed father (Hossein Mahjub), his grandmother
(Salmeh Feizi) and his sisters. Wildflowers and lush green hills
and forests fill the screen; sounds of woodpeckers, insects and
rushing streams provide a backdrop to the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Nature often plays a major role in Iranian cinema. ``It's
cheaper to film in rural settings, requires fewer permissions and
there's less censorship,'' said Hamid Dabashi, a professor of
Iranian studies at Columbia University. ``But there's a deeper
reason,'' he added. ``In recent history Iran has lived through a
revolution and a war. There's a subconscious desire to reclaim the
land. Filmmakers are doing it visually. You take the camera and
go.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Paradise,'' the natural world that both gives life and
takes it away is reflected in the narrative. Over the grandmother's
objections, the father tries to pawn Mohammad off to a blind
carpenter. Their struggle takes on religious overtones, with the
blindness shifting metaphorically to the father, who cannot see the
beauty around him and for whose soul the grandmother fears. ``In
Iran, we refer to the blind as `light' or `bright-hearted,' meaning
that they have a wisdom in their hearts,'' said Akrami. ``There is
this idealized vision that somebody who's blind can see more than
other people do.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, life for the blind in Iran is difficult; they are
often marginalized by society, much like many of Majidi's other
characters. ``He cares deeply about social issues,'' Akrami said.
``The life in `Children of Heaven' could have been his own life as
a child.'' ``Paradise'' is Majidi's fourth feature, but only the
second released in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   His first, ``Baduk'' (1992), is about fatherless children who
are sold into slavery. His second, ``The Father'' (1995), centers
on the struggle between an adolescent boy and his stepfather.
Although set in Iran, the film has a Hollywood style with chase
scenes, quick cuts and traditional plot.
</P>
<P>
   It is Majidi's two most recent films that have more of the
languorous qualities associated with Iranian cinema, a sign,
perhaps, of the director's maturing or of the success of Iranian
films on the festival circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood cinema was a big influence in Iran, even over the
past 20 years when it had to go underground,'' Akrami said. ``First
time around, you're dominated by those formulas.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the themes of his films, it's not surprising to learn that
Majidi was only 16 when his father died. Ramezani's father is also
dead; to elicit moving performances from him, Majidi would often
tap into his sense of loss.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the film's strongest scenes, Mohammad delivers a
heartbreaking monologue about having been born blind. It was based
on an afternoon in the production office when Ramezani's brother
was late picking him up. ``He said that people get tired of him
after a few days, that they're only with him out of pity,''
recalled Majidi. ```If I see God one day,' the boy said, `I'm going
to ask him, `Why did you create me in this form?' I asked him to
recreate that monologue for the camera and for two days before
shooting talked with him about his father.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking late last month from Tehran, where he was finishing
production on a film about a relationship between a young Iranian
Turk and an Afghani migrant worker, Majidi recounted how Ramezani
had been interviewed for magazines, radio and television.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's more famous than I am,'' Majidi said, laughing. In a
perfect world, a bright future would await Ramezani. As Mohammad,
he was sensitive and charming; wearing sunglasses, he exuded the
charisma of a young rock star. But the director worries about his
life after the attention has subsided; acting roles for the blind,
of course, are few and far between.
</P>
<P>
   So, how did the star like the film?
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time he saw it was at Fajr, the Tehran film
festival,'' Majidi said. ``Before the movie screened, he went up to
the microphone and said, `You have no idea how happy I am to be
watching my movie today.' I was sitting next to him, and the people
around us were dividing their attention between him and the film.
During scenes with no dialogue, he'd ask me what we were watching.
And when there were scenes when he wasn't in them, I'd whisper to
him what was happening. In one, the father was having a fight with
the grandmother. He listened carefully, and at the end of the scene
turned to me and said, `You know, she really is a fine actress.'''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a sobering assessment of the deteriorating
situation in Kosovo, a senior Pentagon official said Tuesday that
the NATO-led peacekeeping operation, which includes American
troops, had reached a ``decisive moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The official, who just returned from a visit to the American
sector in Kosovo, did not say that more American troops would be
sent to Kosovo. But the situation is so precarious that ``we're at
ground zero,'' even though NATO-led troops have been in Kosovo
since June, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   By this, the official meant that the United Nations effort to
restart civilian life was so weak in Kosovo that the American
troops were still involved in chores that should be done by the
police and the courts.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, an insurgency outside Kosovo's border in
southern Serbia had sprung up, causing new problems. The official
described a situation in which troops could not keep the peace
between Serbs and Albanians within Kosovo and at the same time seal
Kosovo's borders, as the commander of the NATO-led troops there,
Gen. Klaus Reinhardt, has suggested.
</P>
<P>
   In order to seal just the rugged 125-mile border of Kosovo that
the American troops are in charge of, ``two to three times'' more
troops would be required, the official said. About 6,000 American
troops are now stationed in Kosovo, all based in the eastern part
of the territory.
</P>
<P>
   To get a better handle on what was happening in the Presevo
Valley, just over Kosovo's border in southern Serbia, the official
said the Pentagon was planning to send unmanned aerial vehicles,
known as drones, for surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   The official, who briefed reporters on Tuesday, said he believed
that about 500 Albanian insurgents organized into ``8 to 10
elements'' were in the ``no-man's land'' between eastern Kosovo and
Serbia and in the Presevo Valley.
</P>
<P>
   NATO military officials are concerned that the Albanians are
making targets of Serbian policemen there, which could provoke a
crackdown against the Albanians from the Yugoslav president,
Slobodan Milosevic. This, they fear, could cause a possible repeat
of circumstances that caused NATO's war last year over Kosovo:
Serbian repression of ethnic Albanian civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The senior Pentagon official said Tuesday that it had not been
decided how NATO would react if that happened. ``At what point you
make a move, that's a political decision,'' he said. ``As of today,
we cannot cross over'' into Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The official said the Clinton administration was attempting to
deliver a serious message to the ethnic Albanian leadership in
Kosovo, particularly through the State Department spokesman, James
Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting on Tuesday in Gnjilane, the main town in the
eastern zone, Rubin told local leaders from the Presevo Valley that
NATO would not intervene if a conflict blew up beyond the Kosovo
borders.

U.S. TO DROP LONGTIME BAN ON LUXURIES FROM IRAN
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When moderates triumphed in parliamentary elections
in Iran last month, they probably did not anticipate that their
victories would resonate in the living rooms of wealthy Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clinton administration, eager to encourage moderation in
the land where the United States has been reviled as the Great
Satan, is about to ease some import bans on Iranian consumer goods:
pistachios, caviar and carpets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This opens the door for trade in both directions and does it
in a way that is purely commercial, and on a purely civilian
basis,'' said Robert Pelletreau, the chairman of the American
Iranian Council, an organization founded several years ago for
discussion of issues involving the United States and Iran, and a
former American envoy to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   The value of the pistachios, caviar and carpets may be
relatively small in terms of Iran's overall trade but it is
significant for the boost it can give to private Iranian
entrepreneurs by pumping much-needed hard currency into their
country, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The move may also affect another kind of currency, less definite
but no less real, in the United States: the social cachet that
comes from being able to buy things that have been largely
forbidden since the shah of Iran was driven from the Peacock Throne
in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Persian rugs are better than those from, say, India or
Pakistan may be debatable, just as it is debatable whether caviar
from Iranian sturgeons is better than that from Russian sturgeons.
But some merchants who deal in rugs and caviar predicted Tuesday
night that imports from Iran would become fashionable almost
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Iranian caviar ``is going to be very trendy,'' predicted
Silverio Benitez, a sales associate at Petrossian's
restaurant-boutique in New York, which sold more caviar last year
than ever before, partly because people wanted to put something
special on their crackers to celebrate the arrival of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Benitez declined to say exactly how much caviar Petrossian sells
(Tiffany doesn't boast of its sales in diamonds, after all), but he
allowed that it sells about as much as any eatery on the planet.
And no wonder: Petrossian will fix up a nice caviar picnic basket
for a mere $75 or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, this is going to open up the caviar market,''
Benitez said. But will prices go down? And if they do, for how
long? Will the Iranian caviar be as good as the Russian caviar that
Petrossian gets from the Caspian Sea by way of Paris? And will
people who like caviar be able to tell the difference?
</P>
<P>
   Benitez withheld predictions on those weighty issues. But he was
sure that Iranian caviar will become popular ``because it's
available.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Cuban cigars? ``Exactly.'' Well, not exactly.
</P>
<P>
   As for Persian rugs (so-called because they have been around
since long before Persia became Iran in 1935), two prominent
Washington-area rug businessmen predicted that they will become the
rage simply because they will become available.
</P>
<P>
   James Keshishian, whose family business has been selling rugs in
Washington and its suburbs for 70 years, said prices of Persian
rugs might go up at first, then come down as the supply grows, then
go up again as Iranian exporters get shrewder in the ways of the
Western marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may sell very well,'' Keshishian said. ``If they look
right.'' His voice softened as he explained how Persian rug makers
sometimes wash their creations gently in tea to soften the colors
and texture.
</P>
<P>
   Keshishian, who has taught college courses in rug appraisal,
recalled the days before the shah was toppled, when 60 percent of
the rugs his business sold were Persian and 40 percent were
``everything else.'' Since then, he said, his business has sold
``70 percent everything else and 30 percent Persian,'' with the
bulk of the Persian rugs two decades or more old.
</P>
<P>
   Another Washington-area rug seller, who asked not to be
identified by name for fear of offending anyone, said he sells lots
of Indian and Pakistani rugs but still welcomes the lifting of the
import bans. ``Persians make better rugs,'' he said. ``They've been
at it a long time. We'll sell quite a few.''
</P>
<P>
   The lifting of the import ban is likely to be announced here on
Friday at a conference of the American Iranian Council,
administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said President Clinton
has been looking at a variety of ways to ``encourage a constructive
dialogue'' with Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the World Bank said on Tuesday that it is considering
loans to Iran, totaling $231 million, for the first time since
1994. So far, the United States opposes the loans, which would be
used for sewerage and education. When it comes to easing world
tensions, caviar and rugs go only so far.

   Home-Equity Lender Profits With Wall Street's Help
</P>
<P>
   First Alliance, a national home-equity lender, has been sued by
more than a dozen consumers who contend the company has used a
deceptive sales pitch to lure homeowners into loans that expose
them to the threat of foreclosure and financial ruin. The company
has also been sued by regulators in four states. But First
Alliance, which steadfastly denies wrongdoing, still has some very
important supporters: the investment banks on Wall Street that help
it raise the money lent to people. An investigation by The New York
Times and the ABC News program ``20/20'' shows they have pumped
hundreds of millions of dollars into First Alliance in recent
years, even as lawsuits and state inquiries have raised questions
about its practices.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George Bush
of Texas claimed their parties' nominations Tuesday night, marking
the official if anticlimactic end to their primary campaigns and
the beginning of what promises to be one of the longest
general-election campaigns in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   The two nominees effectively secured their nominations last week
when their only remaining serious rivals, former Sen. Bill Bradley
and Sen. John McCain, dropped out after defeats in nationwide
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday night the voters in Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi,
Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas gave Gore enough delegates to the
Democratic convention to lock up the nomination. Bush came within a
few dozen delegates, but his campaign's reckoning of the
complicated delegate calculus, including results from so-called
beauty contest primaries, put him over the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I filed for president, I pledged I'd come home to Texas
with the nomination of my party,'' Bush said in remarks prepared
for a reception Tuesday night in Austin, Texas. ``Tonight we can
say: Mission accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are halfway _ but only halfway _ to ending the Clinton-Gore
era in Washington, D.C. To get there, we must face one more
Clinton-Gore campaign. The last week has been a preview: The Gore
campaign will say anything to try to win at any cost. We will
confront their tactics one more time, and this time, we will
prevail and they will fail. They will fail because Americans have
caught on.''
</P>
<P>
   Ticking off the states that put him over the top, Gore told a
rally at a high school here, ``We have now won enough delegates to
secure the Democratic nomination,'' adding: ``Tonight the South put
us over the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has pulled even with Bush in the national polls, was
signaling that he would not concede the South or states like
Florida to the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   As they prepare for the eight months until the November
elections, the candidates are now the titular heads of their
respective parties. Gore takes over the Democrats after an
eight-year reign by Bill Clinton, and Bush the Republicans after a
turbulent era in which the party's loudest if not strongest voice
was that of the deposed speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign feels it has the more palpable advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is, as of tonight, we are the
presumed nominee, and under party rules, the party can pay for
travel and a lot of other things,'' said Tony Coelho, the Gore
campaign chairman. He added that, contrary to conventional wisdom,
Gore would not have to schedule ``official'' vice presidential
visits to make up for a lack of campaign funds, since the campaign
has about $13 million on hand.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's advisers also said he could now more freely raise money
for the party, and he has been taking advantage of that freedom. He
is attending three fund-raisers in the space of a week. Last
Saturday he raised about $100,000 in Houston. On Monday night, he
raised $200,000 from about 400 people attending a reception in
Belle Meade, a wealthy, generally Republican suburb of Nashville.
He has another fund-raiser scheduled for Washington on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Having the nomination in hand is also helping Gore organize his
campaign. Now that he is the nominee, he can start pulling together
the Democratic National Committee organizations in each state, one
Gore strategist said. On Monday night the vice president called
about 30 Democratic mayors to Nashville for a strategy session on
how to use their city machines as a counterweight to the state
organizations of the Republican governors supporting Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The mayors, Gore told them, are on the front lines. ``You give
me a swap out straight up between all the Republican governors and
the Democratic mayors, and I'm with you all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has already made wide use of the 31 Republican governors
who have supported him and Ari Fleischer, Bush's spokesman, said
there were no other advantages to clinching the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates now face the challenge of sustaining the
interest of voters without turning them off.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates are aggressively trying to define each other and
control the debate as they emerge from the primary process, and
they are both putting their opposition research operations into
high gear. Gore is casting Bush as a lightweight who lacks the
experience to run the country; Bush is chaining Gore to President
Clinton and raising doubts about the vice president's integrity and
his ability to tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that both sides are already fully engaged, Bush
volunteers traveled to the small brick Forks River Elementary
School in Elmwood, Tenn., Tuesday morning, where Gore was voting in
the Tennessee primary, to hand out anti-Gore literature.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is already showing the same aggressiveness in the race
against Bush that he showed in the primaries toward Bradley. He
sought to take control Tuesday night, at least symbolically, by
sending an e-mail message to Bush, in which he reiterated his
challenge to eliminate all campaign commercials and debate twice a
week instead.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the earliest point in a campaign in modern times
that the parties have selected their nominees, when neither nominee
has been an incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   Gore actually reached and surpassed the magic number of 1,269
delegates Tuesday morning before the day's votes were tallied. This
was possible because over the last week, the party's superdelegates
_ its leaders and elected officials and others who will
automatically attend the convention in August _ pledged their
allegiance to him, by phone and by mail.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans do not have superdelegates. Bush began the day
with 654 delegates and 341 were at stake Tuesday. That was 39 short
of the 1,034 need to claim the nomination. But under different
methods of calculation he had 227 more delegates from earlier
races.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the voting Tuesday, Bush received as much as 88 percent of
the vote, in Mississippi, to 74 percent in Florida. On the
Democratic side, Gore obtained 92 percent of the vote in Tennessee
to 69 percent in Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his ability to win his party's nomination without losing
a single state, Gore, who first ran for president in 1988, remained
cautious about his achievement. ``It's still a little premature to
go, `Yahoo,''' Gore told a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a fall-off of attention in the news media, that's
fine,'' he added. ``There's a natural rhythm and cycle to news
coverage. I don't worry about that. But in terms of my effort to
communicate directly with voters, there will be no let-up at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Making it clear that Gore will not be the only candidate dealing
with education issues, the Bush campaign released literature on
Bush's education proposals, plus a fact sheet on what the Bush
campaign said were measures of how schools have failed to improve
under the Clinton-Gore administration.
</P>
<P>
   The references to education by the campaign and in Bush's speech
Tuesday night highlight one of the governor's greatest challenges,
jettisoning some of the perceptions, left by the dynamics of his
campaign against McCain, that his persona and positions are too far
to the right.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was clearly sending signals to voters in the center with
the circumstances of his victory speech here Tuesday night. He held
it at a Jewish community center and was introduced by Mayor Carlos
Ramirez of El Paso, a Democrat who also happens to be Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez's presence underscored the degree to which Bush has
cobbled together more political support from minorities in Texas
than Republicans traditionally command and spoke to Bush's hope of
establishing the same crossover appeal nationally.

U.S. IS SAID TO SEEK DEATH PENALTY IN EMBASSY BOMBINGS IN AFRICA 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are pursuing the
death penalty against at least one defendant in the bombings of two
U.S. embassies in East Africa in 1998, according to defense lawyers
involved in the broad terrorism case.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant, Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali, is one of three
suspects in the embassy bombings who could face the death penalty,
and the lawyers said it now appeared very likely that prosecutors
would also seek the death penalty against the other two.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan,
which has not been made public, is subject to approval by Attorney
General Janet Reno. But death penalty experts said they expected
Reno to concur, noting that she has given approval in all four
previous cases in which White's office has sought capital
punishment. Each of those cases resulted in plea bargains that led
to long prison terms.
</P>
<P>
   The decision in the al-'Owhali case has been watched
particularly closely by death penalty experts because prosecutors
say he was a suicide bomber who had actually wanted to die as a
martyr in the explosion at the embassy in Nairobi, Kenya. That
bombing and a nearly simultaneous explosion at the embassy in Dar
es Salaam, Tanzania, killed more than 200 people and wounded
thousands on Aug. 7, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The death penalty decision is also the first in the series of
major terrorism prosecutions of about two dozen Islamic militants
in New York since the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, including
another plot to blow up major landmarks in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In some of those cases, the convicted terrorists did not face
the death penalty because their crimes occurred before a 1994 law
that broadly expanded the use of capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Two lawyers for al-'Owhali, Leonard F. Joy and David I. Bruck,
would not comment Tuesday on White's decision to pursue a capital
case. The lawyers had met with prosecutors recently to make a
direct appeal against a death penalty prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   White's office also refused to discuss her decision Tuesday or
say whether she planned to seek the death penalty against two other
defendants in the embassy bombings. But a lawyer for another
defendant, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said he learned
of White's decision Tuesday. ``This sort of takes the mystery out
of what's going to happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A total of six defendants are in custody in the case in New
York, but the other three are not charged with capital crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Al-'Owhali is the only defendant whom prosecutors directly
accused of being a would-be suicide bomber. Al-'Owhali, who was the
first suspect brought back to New York from Africa in the weeks
after the bombing, was said to have acknowledged that he rode as a
passenger in the truck that carried the massive bomb to the U.S.
Embassy in Nairobi, according to federal charges.
</P>
<P>
   The government has charged that al-'Owhali admitted to
investigators that he tossed a dummy grenade at a security guard
seconds before the bomb was detonated, that he was prepared to die
and that the bombing was intended as a ``martyrdom operation in
which he did not expect to survive.'' The indictment also contends
that the driver of the truck, identified only as Azzam, was killed
in the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   A number of defense lawyers and others have questioned whether
the government would seek the death penalty for such a defendant,
since it would then seem to offer him the reward he was seeking: a
highly publicized execution and a trip to paradise at the hands of
his enemy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It was not clear Tuesday how White and a committee of
prosecutors who examined the case viewed such issues. Nor was it
known whether White's office considered how a death penalty
prosecution in the bombing case would play out in Islamic
countries, including Afghanistan. The man suspected of
masterminding the embassy bombings, Osama bin Laden, has been
living there under the protection of the fundamentalist Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   One effect of a capital prosecution will most likely be to force
two separate trials before Judge Leonard B. Sand in U.S. District
Court in Manhattan. One trial would involve el-'Owhali and any of
his co-defendants who face the death penalty, and the other would
involve the defendants accused of participating in what the
government says is bin Laden's global terrorism conspiracy against
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   A single trial for all the defendants is now scheduled for
September.
</P>
<P>
   The other two defendants who could face the death penalty are
Mohammed Saddiq Odehand Khalfan Khamis Mohamed.
</P>
<P>
   As has been the practice in other federal death penalty cases,
the defense lawyers, Joy, Bruck and Robert Tucker, are expected to
travel to Washington and ask Reno's office to overrule White.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawyers who have watched the four other federal death
penalty cases in Manhattan said that Reno had been generally
unreceptive to such appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, they said, in two other recent cases in Manhattan, Reno
is believed to have overruled a decision by White not to seek the
death penalty and ordered a capital prosecution. In one case, the
defendant has pleaded guilty. The other case is pending.

CANDIDATE GENE KELLY TAKES A STEP FORWARD IN EARLY RETURNS IN
TEXAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gene Kelly, a perennial candidate with a famous
name, was leading a field of five candidates in early returns
Tuesday for the Democratic nomination for a longshot challenge of
U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Gandy, an Austin economic development consultant and
former state representative, was battling Don Clark, a Mesquite
businessman, for a runoff spot against Kelly on April 11.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, a military retiree from Universal City, a San Antonio
suburb, has unsuccessfully run for office four times in the past
eight years and shares the name of a now-deceased dancer and movie
star.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly vowed to fight for the ``interest of the working people of
Texas and their families.'' His goals included protecting Social
Security, strengthening Medicare and making health care available
to everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Gandy, the only Democrat in the race who has previously been
elected to public office, has advocated campaign-finance reform,
expanded access to health care and environmental improvements.
</P>
<P>
   He was an early favorite of some Democratic activists and
received some key endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, a computer programmer, systems engineer and analyst, has
called for continuing AIDS research, ``reasonable'' gun-control
measures, preserving the environment, rebuilding the military and
opening foreign markets to U.S. products.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see enormous opportunities ahead as technology continues to
enrich our lives, but I remain disappointed in the inequities that
wrinkle our social fabric,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the Democratic runoff will face an uphill fight in
November against Hutchison, the Republican incumbent who was
unopposed in her party's primary and already has raised $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   The once-dominant Texas Democratic party, suffering through hard
times after losing all statewide races in the last two general
elections, failed to recruit a well-known candidate to challenge
Hutchison.
</P>
<P>
   But five mostly unknown hopefuls stepped forward.
</P>
<P>
   They also included Bobby Wightman-Cervantes, a Dallas lawyer who
spent election day in jail, and H. Gerald Bintliff of Leonard in
Fannin County, a former airline employee.
</P>
<P>
   Wightman-Cervantes, a New York native who ran unsuccessfully for
a Dallas judgeship as a Republican in 1998, was arrested at his
home Thursday and is serving a 90-day contempt of court sentence
stemming from a 1997 incident in which he accused a judge of
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Wightman-Cervantes had appealed the jail sentence, but a federal
magistrate recently denied his latest appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Wightman-Cervantes, who includes his mother's Hispanic maiden
name as part of his surname, also lost a court fight against the
Texas Democratic Party, which listed him on ballots as Bobby
Wightman.
</P>
<P>
   Bintliff, who has no government experience, made campaign
finance reform and tax relief two of his top priorities. He also
proposed legalizing various drugs, abolishing the death penalty and
discouraging tobacco smoking.
</P>
<P>
   A Libertarian Party candidate, Mary J. Ruwart, also is seeking
the Senate seat.

IMF SAYS UKRAINE OVERSTATED AMOUNT OF THE NATIONAL RESERVES
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday
that Ukraine, a leading recipient of aid from the United States and
international financial institutions, misled the fund's experts
about the size of foreign currency reserves and persuaded the fund
to give it more money than it otherwise would have received.
</P>
<P>
   In the statement issued Monday night, the Washington-based fund
said that the Ukrainian central bank, in three separate
transactions from 1996 to 1998, created the impression that it
controlled more foreign currency than was actually the case. The
amount of money involved was nearly $1 billion, the monetary fund
said.
</P>
<P>
   The monetary fund and the U.S. Treasury Department announced
that they would consider whether to put new controls on future
loans to Ukraine as a consequence of the findings. The fund said
any future disbursements of aid to the country would be
administered by the fund itself and would not be deposited directly
in Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   The fund examines how much foreign currency an aid recipient has
as one key measure of the overall health of its economy. It serves
as an indicator of how much foreign investment is flowing into the
country, the strength of a country's currency and the stability of
its banking system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that a number of transactions in 1996-98 gave the
impression that Ukraine's reserves were larger than was actually
the case,'' the fund said in a statement. ``The view of the IMF
staff is that Ukraine appears to have received disbursements from
the IMF on three occasions in late 1997 and early 1998 that it
would not have done if the true state of Ukraine's reserves had
been known at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The manipulation of currency reserves suggests that Ukraine
engaged in tactics similar to those used in neighboring Russia in
recent years. U.S. lawmakers have sharply criticized the fund's
management of Russia's multibillion-dollar foreign aid program,
accusing the fund of turning a blind eye to corruption and of
fueling official graft there.
</P>
<P>
   The fresh revelations also come at a time when critics of the
monetary fund have been pressing for a radical overhaul of its
operations. A congressional commission just last week issued a
scathing critique of the fund and recommended that it cease all its
long-term lending programs, including those in Russia and Ukraine.

MICROSOFT LICENSES MEDIA PLAYER FREE TO MAIN COMPETITOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (hm) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Microsoft Corp. said Tuesday that it had
licensed its Windows Media Player technology, without charge, to
its main competitor, RealNetworks.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft used the occasion to assert that its digital media
effort _ producing software for Internet users to listen to audio
and watch video _ is moving ahead rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's news is significant for the future of digital media,''
said Will Poole, general manager of Microsoft's Digital Media
Division. He said the announcement would lead to new momentum for
audio and video producers to settle on a single media format _ one
controlled by Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts and Microsoft competitors offered a mixed view on
whether there had been any real shift in an industry alignment
where Microsoft has been a clear No. 3 until now.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Glaser, a former Microsoft executive who is founder and
chairman of RealNetworks, played down Microsoft's announcement.
``Microsoft is working as our PR department,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His company's software, RealPlayer, which is available for a
variety of operating systems, has a significant lead over the
Microsoft Windows Media Player by most market research
measurements.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you cut through the malarkey, this is a release about
Microsoft being one of nine codecs,'' or competing formats, that
RealPlayer will be equipped to play, he said. The Windows player
also plays files in several formats, but not in RealNetwork's.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's executives said that Tuesday's licensing deal and a
report by the Internet measurement company Media Metrix were
indications that the industry would soon move to a single media
format: Microsoft's. The Media Metrix report found that Windows
Media Player was used more than any other multimedia player in
American households in December.
</P>
<P>
   But Glaser and several industry analysts said that for technical
and other reasons, Microsoft was unlikely to achieve the dominance
with its Media Player that its Internet Explorer program gained
over Netscape's rival Navigator browser.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that Windows Media Player is the fastest-growing
format, but it's from an installed base of zero,'' said Richard
Doherty, president of Envisioneering Inc., a computer industry
consulting firm, in Seaford, N.Y. ``Also, their position hasn't
been earned so much as blazed with a trail of greenbacks.''
</P>
<P>
   He said RealNetworks still had a technical advantage over
Microsoft, and a large lead in installed base, having distributed
more than 100 million copies of its software.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the Media Metrix numbers cited Tuesday by
Microsoft, Nielsen/NetRatings reported that in the month of
November, various versions of RealPlayer were used by 8.9 million
people on the Internet, representing 12.1 percent of active
Internet users. Microsoft's Windows Media Player was not only far
behind; with 2.4 million users and a market share of 3.2 percent,
it was not even in second place. No. 2 in November was Apple
Computer's Quick Time media player, with 5.4 million users and a
7.4 percent market share.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts Tuesday did see risk for RealNetworks in
Microsoft's strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The downside is that Microsoft's technology may become the
default standard,'' said Rob Enderle, vice president and research
leader at Giga Information Group, a market research firm in Santa
Clara, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   That apparently will not happen any time soon. Both RealNetworks
and Microsoft executives acknowledged that the clear dominant media
standard is still the free MP3 technology, an audio format
controlled by none of the big players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't call MP3 the 800-pound gorilla,'' Doherty said.
``It's more like a pack of hundreds of mischievous chimps.''

A PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE TO PUBLIC SCHOOLS
</HEADLINE>
   (Lessons Column) 
(hm) 
 By RICHARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Between a booming economy and reports of growing disillusion
with public schools, you'd expect private school enrollment to
soar. Yet the proportion of students in private schools has been
falling nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, it's easy to get the idea that more parents now
choose private schools. Advocates of tax-funded private education
often suggest that vouchers are inevitable, because more parents
now ``vote with their feet'' to abandon public schools. Even some
public education supporters believe there has been a shift to
private schooling. Recently, Gov. Gray Davis of California proposed
scholarships for public school students who perform well, a program
critics contend would mostly aid the well-off. Not true, Davis
said, because nowadays few affluent students attend public schools.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is otherwise. Only about 15 percent of children from
the highest-earning one-fifth of families were at private schools
in 1997, down slightly from 1979. At the other end, few poor
children (those from the lowest-earning one-fifth of families) ever
attended private schools, and this percentage has also dropped. As
for children from the middle three-fifths, here, too, the private
school share has fallen.
</P>
<P>
   We hear a lot about charter schools, but their enrollment is
still less than 1 percent of American students. Home schooling is
apparently growing, but numbers are small, relative to the public
system. In contrast, polls show that Americans praise the mostly
traditional, mostly suburban public schools their children attend.
Only when surveys ask about schools generally does satisfaction
fall, perhaps because impressions don't come from direct
experience.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in private school percentages results partly from
fewer parochial students as Roman Catholic families have moved from
urban ethnic enclaves to suburbs. But even expensive independent
schools enroll surprisingly few students. About 4 percent of
children from high-income families are in nonreligious private
schools, up only a fraction from 1979.
</P>
<P>
   A mistaken impression of gains by private schools may stem from
accounts of a small but opinion-shaping group of affluent parents,
living in areas like Manhattan, the Hyde Park section of Chicago
and Adams-Morgan in Washington. They do choose private education,
unlike most in the middle class, who seek better public schools by
moving to suburbs filled with similar families.
</P>
<P>
   But in truth, few parents can really discern ``good'' schools
that help students stretch their potential. Real estate agents
point to test scores and college admission rates, but students from
literate families test well even if a school's instruction adds
little to how they would perform in any setting. A school's
socioeconomic makeup can predict average test scores with startling
accuracy. Some suburban schools are unusually effective, but it's
hard to tell which ones.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, moving to a suburb with high test scores is
rational, because peers are important. Children tend to excel more
when surrounded by others whose families expect academic success.
In neighborhoods where most children lack this support, performance
can lag even with the best instruction.
</P>
<P>
   Middle-class movement to suburbs with ``better'' schools is
accelerating. Across the nation, more workers with city jobs now
commute from suburbs, where they send their children to public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   An exception is a growing class of college-educated couples
living in central cities. Though few compared with suburbanites,
their numbers are increasing. Some may willingly trade access to
suburban public schools for the growing amenities of city living.
</P>
<P>
   Yet their urban neighborhood schools enroll many relatively
low-scoring poor children. Teachers may be effective, but they are
preoccupied with coaching basic skills that middle-class children
take for granted. There is less peer pressure to aim for admission
to Ivy League universities. So affluent parents conclude that these
schools are inadequate, and try for private placements.
</P>
<P>
   Many who now choose urban lifestyles attended suburban public
schools when they were young. Their new neighborhood schools,
filled with low achievers, are unlike those they recall from
childhood, so these city dwellers easily conclude that public
schools used to be better. But the quality of middle-class suburban
schools has not declined. What's new is the presence of affluent
families in poor people's neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   These high-income urban parents face a difficult dilemma. Should
they send their children to neighborhood public schools that lack
peer influences to raise achievement, or seek private schools
filled with students whose families are like theirs? However they
resolve this, their quandary shouldn't obscure the continuing
allegiance of most middle-class families to suburban public
education.
</P>
<P>
   If Americans now ``vote with their feet,'' they typically do so
by moving toward public schools, not away from them.

NEWS ANALYSIS: MUSEUMS GIRD FOR NEW SALVOS IN THE CULTURE WARS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last fall it was ``Sensation,'' the show of
contemporary British art in Brooklyn that offended religious groups
and animal-rights activists. Now it is ``Sanitation,'' the
soon-to-be-unveiled installation at the Whitney Museum of American
Art that some people say trivializes the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ``What next?'' asks Abraham H. Foxman, national director of the
Anti-Defamation League, which objects to the Whitney's decision to
show ``Sanitation.''
</P>
<P>
   People in the art world are asking the same question, but not
about the art.
</P>
<P>
   After a breather in the mid-1990s, the culture wars that began
in the late 1980s seem to be resuming, and museum officials worry
that their institutions, not the halls of Congress, are
increasingly becoming the battlefields. As they see it, the
contemporary art they show _ as provocative as it often is _ is
only one ingredient of the trend. More troubling is what they say
is the growing tendency of Americans, in this no-holds-barred
talk-show culture, to try to suppress ideas they do not like.
</P>
<P>
   Joan E. Bertin, executive director of the National Coalition
Against Censorship, which monitors the arts and literature as well
as other spheres, says she sees something even more disturbing in
this climate of of intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it's not the numbers that tell the story,'' she said.
Rather, she went on, the impulse to suppress difficult art and
ideas is now coming from the left _ from feminists, civil rights
advocates, gay activists _ as well as from the right.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different when it comes from the left, which is
traditionally anti-authoritarian,'' Bertin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people who say they believe in free thinking draw lines
and say, `Not here,' it's more troubling,'' she explained. ``And
when it comes from both sides of the political spectrum, there's a
legitimacy provided.''
</P>
<P>
   Attacks from the right and the left broaden what is likely to be
protested. The right usually objects to artworks that include
nudity, have sexual or religious themes, or denigrate symbols of
patriotism like the American flag. In recent years, from the left,
feminists have opposed the display of nudes, Bertin said, while
blacks have protested the art of Kara Walker, saying her
often-brutal depictions of black life reinforce racial stereotypes.
Some years ago blacks and other groups objected to a mocking
portrait of Harold Washington, Chicago's first black mayor, in an
exhibition there.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are using the `Words wound' theory,'' Bertin said. ``The
idea that racist speech, for example, is tantamount to a racist
act. It's a blurring of the distinction between the act and the
idea. And it's increasingly shared across the political spectrum.''
As a result life for many museums could get more difficult.
Although art has been provocative in one way or another for
centuries, since at least the 1960s a great deal of contemporary
work has focused on politics and social problems. ``There is no way
to be a museum that shows contemporary art and not engage in social
and political issues, because that's what artists are doing,'' said
Carol Becker, dean of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The fights in Washington over funds for the National Endowment
for the Arts encouraged that trend among artists, serving as a
challenge, not a warning, to them. In ``Sanitation,'' for example,
Hans Haacke, the German-born artist, tries to make a point about
the First Amendment's protection of artistic freedom. By lining up
a row of garbage cans that blare the sound of marching troops and
creating a wall of condemnatory quotations from Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani and others in Fraktur script, a traditional German
typeface once also favored by the Third Reich, he seeks to connect
the Nazi campaign to ban ``degenerate'' art with the present-day
statements.
</P>
<P>
   One quotation, from Pat Robertson, the conservative broadcaster,
reads, ``Do you want to face the voters in your district with the
charge that you are wasting their hard-earned money to promote
sodomy, child pornography and attacks on Jesus Christ?''
</P>
<P>
   Even curators acknowledge that some artists make provocative
works as a career move, knowing it will bring them media attention.
But showing the art of the day, vetted by curators and scholars, is
a core mission of museums like the Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney founded this museum,'' said
Maxwell L. Anderson, its director, ``our responsibility has been to
show contemporary art, challenging and not.''
</P>
<P>
   But many museumgoers do not agree with that policy. ``The
biggest problem for art and artists and contemporary art museums is
the gap between what artists are interested in doing and what the
public expects to see in an art museum,'' Becker said.
</P>
<P>
   So far museum officials, fearing self-censorship more than
protests, say they must simply go ahead with exhibitions of the art
that is out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to show the best of world art, and some of that may be
difficult for some people to appreciate,'' said James Welu,
director of the Worcester Art Museum in Massachusetts and president
of the Association of Art Museum Directors. ``But some of the great
art on this earth was controversial in its time.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said: ``If we mount what we show depending on who might
take offense, even the Met would have to clad a lot of nude figures
and cover a lot of other masterpieces. Once you begin that, you
don't know where to draw the line. If no political art could be
shown, David, Gericault and Delacroix could not be shown. It's an
impossible battle.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, curators and directors say, it is hard to predict what
will offend. Becker said she and her colleagues used to joke about
hiring an outsider, preferably a conservative one with values
distant from the contemporary art world, to preview exhibitions and
point out what might be vexing. ``There was truth to it because we
just didn't see what was offensive,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The point, however, was never to remove an offending work but to
try to explain it. Beyond such labels, museums are responding to
recent challenges by posting notices at the entrance to exhibitions
warning visitors that shows contain challenging or difficult work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position has to be, `Don't come to the museum if you're
afraid of being offended, but we'll let you know in advance if
there are works that are likely to be offensive,''' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Any other stance would go against the grain of what the United
States stands for, museum directors seem to be saying. But that
means museums will find themselves increasingly on the defensive.

ADVERTISING: 3 BIG AGENCIES FORM WORLDWIDE PARTNERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The three partners in the world's newest giant agency company
gathered Tuesday for an unusual event that was part pep rally, part
christening, part mixer and part Wall Street warm-up.
</P>
<P>
   The partners, still getting to know one another, are Leo Group
in Chicago, which owns agencies like Leo Burnett and Starcom
Worldwide; the MacManus Group in New York, which owns agencies like
D'Arcy Masius Benton &AMP; Bowles and Mediavest; and Dentsu Inc. in
Tokyo, which owns agencies independently around the world as well
as in partnership in Asian-Pacific markets with Young &AMP; Rubicam
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering, at the Leo headquarters in downtown Chicago, was
to formalize the creation of the agency company born Jan. 31 when
Leo and MacManus merged and then sold a stake of approximately 20
percent to Dentsu for an estimated $400 million. The merged entity
plans an initial public offering in the next 12 to 18 months, and
Dentsu plans one in the fall of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The merged company had temporarily been called BDM _ for
Burnett, Dentsu and MacManus _ until Tuesday, when the official
name was announced: the B Com3 Group. That moniker, likely the
first on Madison Avenue to use a superscript numeral, is an amalgam
of names suggested by several employees, playing on the word
``beacon'' and the number of partners.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the genesis of B Com3 , it underlines a fundamental
reason for the deal, which created a behemoth with revenue last
year of $1.93 billion and billings of $15.7 billion: be big or be
gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today in this business, size does matter, size does matter;
there's no question about it,'' Roy Bostock, chief executive of
MacManus, who becomes chairman of B Com3, said at the event, which
was made available to reporters nationwide by teleconference. ``You
need size and scale to compete aggressively on a global basis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This provides us access to the Japanese market, which is very,
very important,'' he added, because that market is second in
advertising spending only to the United States, ``and provides
Dentsu with much greater capabilities for its clients outside Japan
and Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   Dentsu will have two seats on the seven-member board of B Com3 ,
which will be based in Chicago; the Dentsu executives to take the
seats have not been named. Two other seats go to executives
formerly at MacManus: Bostock, 59, and Craig Brown, 48, who becomes
president and chief operating officer at B Com3 after serving as
vice chairman, chief operating officer and chief financial officer
at MacManus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the next 12 to 18 months, B Com3 will be very active,''
said Roger Haupt, the chief executive, ``building our organization
in areas like direct marketing, database marketing and
e-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed the financial, practical and people resources
available by aligning B Com3 with Dentsu,'' he added, ``which has
helped to create a global advertising powerhouse with 16,000
employees and 500 operating units in 90 countries.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed initial offering of B Com3 shares would ``give us a
currency,'' Haupt said, ``and with that currency, you can be sure
we will aggressively grow this organization.''
</P>
<P>
   As to whether B Com3 would acquire a stake in Dentsu when that
agency goes public just as Dentsu has acquired a stake in B Com3,
Haupt said: ``There are no plans to do so at this stage, but we
frankly have not discussed that. I wouldn't rule it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Haupt, 52, who had been president and chief executive at Leo, is
one of three former Leo executives on the B Com3 board, along with
Richard B. Fizdale, 60, vice chairman, who was chairman at Leo, and
Christian Kimball, 44, chief administrative officer, who held that
same post at Leo.
</P>
<P>
   Leo had long been in discussions with Dentsu, which holds almost
25 percent of the Japanese ad market, about some form of
cooperation; the two share large clients like Coca-Cola, Philip
Morris and Procter &AMP; Gamble, as did Leo and MacManus (not so
coincidentally).
</P>
<P>
   When Leo initiated the merger talks with MacManus last fall,
after the two had abandoned plans to combine Starcom and Mediavest,
Haupt notified Yutaka Narita, president at Dentsu.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new alliance comes at a significant time,'' Narita said
in remarks to the gathering, which he delivered in English.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will give B Com3 true access to Dentsu's vast resources in
Japan,'' he added, like its powerful media services operations,
``while building a strong network'' for Dentsu abroad ``to exceed
the expectations of our global clients.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked by a reporter whether Dentsu was interested in expanding
further in the United States by acquiring agencies like Rubin
Postaer &AMP; Associates, Narita replied: ``We are not planning to buy
anything. We have two good partners here.''
</P>
<P>
   The other executives were quite deferential to Narita. For
instance, Fizdale described him as ``a most revered guest'' and
said to him, ``Narita-san, you distinguish us with your presence.''
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the event was informal, sometimes even jocular. When
a reporter asked how the partners would tackle disagreements among
themselves, Bostock replied: ``If there are differences, the chief
executive will make the call. So if there are any problems, Roger's
got to solve them.''
</P>
<P>
   Haupt at one point gave Bostock and Narita what he described as
``the keys to the door'' of the Leo headquarters, which becomes the
B Com3 headquarters. And he later said that he pursued the merger
so aggressively with Bostock that ``Roy was referring to me as a
stalker.''
</P>
<P>
   Narita, for his part, humorously described as ``destiny'' the
fact that on March 29 and 30, when Major League Baseball opens its
season for the first time in Japan, the Leo, Dentsu and MacManus
headquarters cities will all be involved because ``the Chicago Cubs
will play the New York Mets, in Tokyo.'' &QL;

BUSINESS TRAVEL: A HOTEL DIVIDES ITSELF UP LIKE AN AIRPLANE 
</HEADLINE>
  (duplication warning: also sent with `t' code) 
 (bl)  
 By JOE SHARKEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The following is a typical conversation that Frank
Banks says he used to have back in the early 1990s when trying to
persuade a top corporate executive to stay at the Rihga Royal, the
luxury hotel he runs in midtown Manhattan:
</P>
<P>
   ``I always stay at the Marriott,'' the executive being wooed
might say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why? What's the rate you're paying over there?'' Banks might
ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``About $195 a night for a room.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's the same rate we're charging here for a luxury
suite.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, but the Marriott looks better on paper to my board of
directors.''
</P>
<P>
   Walking the quiet hallways of the Rihga Royal, nearly all of
whose 500 rooms were occupied one day last week, Banks recalled
those days with a shudder. The hotel was new. It was expensive, and
in a then-questionable part of town for business travelers, just
north of Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't Park Avenue, after all,'' he said. ``All I could
think was, how am I going to fill 500 suites and make a profit?''
</P>
<P>
   In the world of high-end corporate travel, decisions were being
made by executives and boards still sensitive to the public outcry
that had accompanied the horror stories of the corporate excesses
of the late 1980s. It was a tough time to be going on line with a
hotel meant largely to appeal to top-shelf tastes in both the
corporate and the leisure trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I divided the hotel up like an airplane, with levels that
corresponded to first class, business class and coach,'' Banks
said. At first, only a single floor of the hotel's suites were in
the top class.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, as the economy began booming and attitudes toward
high-end corporate travel began to loosen across the board, more of
the lower-priced suites were combined and redesigned for the higher
level. Now, Banks said, the hotel has 100 Pinnacle Suites, which
cost $625 for a one bedroom and $1,100 for two bedrooms. Other
suites range up to $3,300 a night for the top-of-the-line Grand
Royal Suites.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the top price for a luxury hotel room in New York
City, where some suites at better-known hotels can cost $9,000 a
night. Instead, the Rihga Royal, which is owned by Royal Hotel
Ltd., a Japanese company, is carefully positioned to appeal to the
sort of corporate executives ``who don't have to get two or three
supervisors to approve their expenses,'' said Banks, who himself
lives in the hotel on West 54th St.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say to corporate travel managers that I don't want big
corporate volume. I want the two or three people in a company who
are going to be able to avail themselves of our level of service.
In effect, it's like selling more first-class and business-class
seats,'' at a time when even airlines are reconfiguring planes to
set aside more premium seats and take advantage of more relaxed
business spending in a booming economy _ for the select few who
qualify for top-dog travel.
</P>
<P>
   Expense accounts from luxury hotels, of course, form only a tiny
portion of the $175 billion that American companies spend a year on
travel and entertainment. Most corporate travel departments _ and
travelers _ are really struggling to deal with increases in costs,
especially for airline travel. Tuesday, the Air Transport
Association reported that with oil prices soaring, airline fuel
prices are expected to rise 40 percent this year, suggesting that
for air travel, ``ticket prices could jump dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   And mostly because of rising air fares, business travel expenses
have already gone up 40 percent in recent years, even without
inflation, said Kevin Mitchell, the chairman of the Business Travel
Coalition, which lobbies for greater competition in the airline
business and better cost controls for business travel across the
board.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't see the kinds of problems in the hotel industry that
we have in the airlines industry,'' Mitchell said. ``Hotels are a
more classic model of a perfect market, where buyers and sellers
both have really good information and there's unrestricted supply
and access to the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   From the 54th floor of the Rihga Royal, looking out across a
section of the city that now throbs with economic prosperity, Banks
said things were looking good for businesses like his that served
the well-heeled traveler willing to pay for space, convenience,
service and in-room amenities like home-style comfort, plus private
fax lines, personalized cell phones and video-phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years, we kept redesigning our suites upward to
change the mix,'' said Banks, who ran his own hotel in
Massachusetts and was a general manager of the St. Regis Hotel in
New York before he took over at the Rihga in 1991, the year after
it opened. ``The demand for a higher lever of service keeps going
up, just like on the airlines.''
</P>
<P>
   He thinks the high end of the market will hold its own for the
foreseeable future. But there are no guarantees, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, if the economy goes south,'' he said, ``we go south
along with it.''

Haas gets past initial awe at Augusta

   That is what Haas, the U.S. Public Links champion from Fort
Worth, seemed to be doing at the guard booth to the main gate
before a recent practice round. His father, Jim, had to nudge him
back to reality. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked through the window at the guy and just froze. He
didn't know what to say,'' Jim Haas said. ``I finally told him,
`Say /{something/}.' '' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Haas stammered: ``I'm Hunter.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The attendant replied: ``Mr. Haas, we've been expecting you all
day.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ice broken, the Southwest High School graduate and former
University of Oklahoma golfer relaxed and made the most of three
practice rounds in preparation for the biggest golfing week of his
career. Haas, 23, will compete April 6-9 at the Masters in Augusta,
Ga., and already has lined up a Tuesday practice round with Arnold
Palmer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But his initial exposure to the course came last weekend, when
Haas squeezed in as much golf as possible between three lightning
delays and pumped as much information as possible out of four[
different] caddies, the course superintendent and a handful of
members. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   First impressions? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There's kind of an eerie feeling about the place. I'm not sure
that's the right word, but everywhere you go, you can sense the
history,'' Haas said. ``You definitely know where you are.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Haas didn't bother keeping score during his rounds. He was more
interested in experiencing as many different shots from as many
different locations as possible. He lined up some U-shaped putts
and chips at the undulating 16th green. He felt the swirling winds
at Amen Corner. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most important, he noticed his comfort zone expanding with each
shot during his Friday-Sunday stay. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For example, Haas flew the green with his approach on No. 1
during his initial practice round. He opted to putt from the
fringe. Four strokes later, he[ 'd] had carded a double bogey. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``But by Sunday, I knew where every putt was going and I was
actually making some long putts,'' Haas said. ``I really liked the
course. I felt comfortable. A lot more comfortable than if I went
in for the first time on Monday \Rof tournament week\S.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During the obligatory tour of club facilities, Haas made some
mental notes and adjusted some logistical plans. The tiny Crow's
Nest, a room in the clubhouse made available to amateurs during
tournament week, will not be a permanent resting place for him. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one or two nights will be fine, just for the
experience,'' Haas said. ``Definitely not for the whole
tournament.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In terms of strategy, Haas got to experience the course in both
firm and wet conditions. A Friday rain limited his practice session
to seven holes but sunny conditions returned during weekend rounds.
Discussions with caddies convinced him that tee shots during
tournament week, when the course is firm and fast, would travel
30-40 yards farther than the shots he hit last weekend when the
course was tailored to members. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``My caddie told me a lot of pros play from the members' tees
this time of year because \Rapproach shots\S wind up where they'll
be hitting from in the tournament,'' Haas said. ``I hit from the
back tees, just for the visual image, then kicked it up 30 or 40
yards. I think that will help me know how to shape shots and where
I need to be in the fairways.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, where Haas would like to be _ on a permanent basis _
is in the room he enjoyed most during his tour: the champion's
locker room. Small and quaint, Haas noticed multiple names on each
door. Even Jack Nicklaus, a six-time champ, doesn't get his own
stall. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``That lets you know you have to earn your spot. They don't just
build a new locker every year,'' Haas said. ``I liked that.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While in the room, Haas said he envisioned his name on one of
those doors. But he didn't care if he shared with Nicklaus, Tiger
Woods or Nick Faldo. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take whatever they can give me,'' Haas said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? Haas already may have taken his first steps in that
direction with last week's introduction to Augusta. &QL;

[cw25][apcred]Michael Caulfield &QR; 
[cut10]{Casey Martin in a cart} has been a losing proposition for
the PGA Tour, whose policy board meets today about whether to
continue the court fight. &QL; 
 &QL; 
[ CHIP SHOTS]  &QL; 
\Nsubheds:Strategy session &QL; 
[agatea]Members of the PGA Tour's policy board convene today to
decide what action, if any, the tour will take in pursuing its
ongoing legal battle with disabled golfer Casey Martin. A U.S.
appeals court in San Francisco ruled 3-0 last week to uphold a 1998
decision by an Oregon court that Martin, 27, should be allowed to
use a cart during competition under the Americans With Disabilities
Act. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Martin suffers from Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome, a
circulatory disorder that has withered his right leg and makes
walking painful. In handing down the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals ruling, judge William Canby wrote: ``The central
competition in shot-making would be unaffected by Martin's
accommodation. ... All that the cart does is permit Martin access
to a type of competition in which he otherwise could not engage
because of his disability. That is precisely the purpose of the
ADA.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem issued a statement saying tour
officials ``will have further comment, if appropriate'' after[
following] today's meeting. The final step in the appeals process
for the tour would be the U.S. Supreme Court, which could not hear
the case until 2001, at the earliest. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Memo to Finchem &AMP; Co: You're already 0-3 when involving courts
on this issue (0-2 in actual legal venues, 0-1 in the court of
public opinion). It's time to do what should have happened
initially: Incorporate a tour bylaw saying players with permanent
disabilities that impair mobility, as attested by a doctor, can
ride a cart during competition. Over the next 100 years, the short
list of players who fit that description and break par regularly
will probably begin and end with Casey Martin. If not, there won't
be enough additions to make it worth the continuation of this
losing battle in the courts. &QL; 
\Nsubheds:Unlucky seven &QL; 
[agatea]Olin Browne[ cq], reigning MasterCard Colonial champion,
was among seven golfers who missed out on a Masters invitation
because of a new rule in place this year at Augusta National Golf
Club. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tournament officials no longer automatically invite every winner
of a PGA Tour event in the previous calendar year. Instead,
invitations go to the top 50 players in the world golf rankings,
with the remaining spots filled by past Masters winners or by
competitors based upon finishes at other major championships
(professional and amateur). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Joining Browne in the first wave of 1999-2000 tournament winners
to get the Augusta snub were Brad Faxon, Rich Beem, J.L. Lewis,
Brian Henninger, Jim Carter and Tom Pernice Jr. [ A pair of]Two
winners from this season, Paul Azinger and Kirk Triplett, squeezed
in based on rankings (No. 49 and No. 27, respectively) as of the
March 6 cutoff. Shigeki Maruyama, a career nonwinner on the PGA
Tour, vaulted into the field because he climbed to No. 48 in the
world rankings by the cutoff date. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's their tournament and they can do what they want. I'm
disappointed not to be invited,'' Browne said, choosing his words
carefully. ``I've played there twice already and think I've shown I
can compete in that setting.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Browne, 40, finished 52nd at last year's Masters. &QL; 
\Nsubheds:O'Meara returns to Colonial Mark O'Meara, one of five
high-profile players who skipped the 1999 MasterCard Colonial to
accept a six-figure appearance fee and compete in a European Tour
event with conflicting dates, has made plans to return to Fort
Worth this season.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara, the 1998 PGA Tour Player of the Year, is among 62
players who have committed to compete in the May 18-21 event. It
will be O'Meara's first visit to Colonial since missing the cut at
the 1995 event.
</P>
<P>
   Other notable commitments released this week by Colonial
officials include four of O'Meara's teammates on the 1999 U.S.
Ryder Cup: Tom Lehman, Justin Leonard, Davis Love III and Steve
Pate. Also on the list are Fort Worth resident Mark Brooks and
two-time Colonial champs Corey Pavin, Bruce Lietzke and Ben
Crenshaw. Matt Gogel, an early contender for PGA Tour Rookie of the
Year honors, also has committed to make his Colonial debut.
</P>
<P>
   Commitments are not binding, but Colonial officials said all 62
players have arranged housing during tournament week and are
expected to compete.
\Nsubheds:LPGA GOLDEN MOMENTS ``To commemorate the LPGA Tour's 50th
anniversary, the'' Star-Telegram ``will feature a significant

1992 Patty Sheehan, an LPGA Hall of Famer with three runner-up
finishes at the U.S. Women's Open, defeated Juli Inkster in an

needed birdies on the final two holes of regulation to force the
playoff.

<P>
   The victory was especially emotional for Sheehan, who
surrendered an 11-stroke lead to Betsy King over the final 33 holes
of the 1990 Open to finish second in heartbreaking fashion. To win

made the 1992 Open the most memorable of her 35 tour victories.

TEXAS REPUBLICAN VOTERS BACK STUDENT-INITIATED PRAYERS AT SPORTING
EVENTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By TONY FREEMANTLE 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The issue is in the hands of the U.S. Supreme Court, but Texas
Republican voters let it be known in a non-binding referendum
Tuesday that they support student-initiated prayers at school
sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   Early returns in the Republican Primary showed voters across the
state approving The Texas Religious Freedom Referendum in large
numbers, with 94 percent saying they think such prayers should be
allowed.
</P>
<P>
   The measure may have been at the bottom of the ballot when
voters stepped into the polling booths _ and it carries no weight
with respect to the law _ but it is an emotional issue for many
Texans, as much part of the ritual of some high school football
games as the contests themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of Texas voters have said with a loud and clear
voice that voluntary, student-initiated prayer at school sporting
events should remain an honored Texas tradition,'' said Susan
Weddington, chairman of the Republican Party of Texas. ``When
activist federal judges decided to ban a Texas tradition and
curtail the rights of Texas students, the Republican Party lead by
providing one of the few forums in which voters could have a voice
in this debate, and the response was overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   The question of whether students should be allowed to pray
before sporting events found its way into the court system in 1995
after some parents in the Santa Fe Independent School District sued
to stop the practice, which they contended violates the
constitutional separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans upheld the
parents argument and ruled that ``nonsectarian, nonproselytizing''
prayers at public high school graduations could not be expanded to
allow prayer before football games, and, in November, the U.S.
Supreme Court agreed to take the case.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney's for the school district are expected to argue that
the prayers are simply the legitimate free expression of students
seeking God's assistance in being good sports during the game, not
official, school-sponsored activities.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney's for the parents, who are being represented by the
American Civil Liberties Union, have said they intend to argue that
while they ``wholeheartedly support'' the students' right to pray,
they cannot support ``government-sponsored prayer'' and that the
essential issue is whether ``student-lead, student-initiated
prayers at football games violate the Establishment Clause of the
First and 14th Amendments.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Griffin, an ACLU attorney from Galveston who is set to
argue the case before the high court later this month, said it was
``disappointing'' that voters apparently still don't appreciate why
it is important to have a constitutionally protected separation
between church and state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (the vote) is probably consistent with the general public
perception that there is nothing wrong with prayer in school,''
Griffin said.
</P>
<P>
   While the lawyers wrestle with the legal ramifications, the
issue took on political significance when the state Republican
Party decided to place it on the primary ballot, a decision that
was apparently not made without dissent from within the party
ranks, and which drew harsh criticism from the state's Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Party officials said part of the reason the measure
was included on the ballot, a decision made behind closed doors,
was that certain members felt it could draw Republicans to the
polls in a Republican presidential primary election that was never
a contest in the state. Other Republicans expressed concern that
there could have been serious negative consequences for the party
if the referendum failed.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the Democrats charged that including the measure
on the primary ballot was nothing more than ``a cheap advertising
ploy to rally right-wing supporters.'' &QL;

HORST KOEHLER: IN THE MIDST OF UPHEAVAL, YET OUT OF PUBLIC SIGHT
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds., see related story IMF-UKRAINE.) 
(fb) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Horst Koehler, a veteran German banker now
expected to run the International Monetary Fund is not widely
known, even in Germany. But he is no stranger to the kinds of
seismic political and economic upheaval that come with the
responsibility of managing a global lender to financially
distressed nations.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler was a financial engineer behind two of Europe's biggest
transformations. The first was the reunification of Germany 10
years ago after the collapse of communism. The second occurred
relatively recently: the creation of the euro, the common currency
that 11 European nations adopted more than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   People who know Koehler say that far from being a political or
economic lightweight, as some critics have suggested, he has the
toughness of someone who has endured trials by fire.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more surprising, he could prove be to be a tough-minded
fiscal conservative in the political battle over the IMF's future
mission and strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Koehler's mentors and longtime colleagues are top
officials at the German central bank, people who have for years
argued that the monetary fund should avoid big bailouts.
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, Koehler may well echo those in Congress and the
Clinton administration who want to curtail some of the lending
institution's activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a conservative _ by his background, his party
affiliation and the jobs he has held,'' said Norbert Walter, chief
economist at Deutsche Bank. ``He is a hard-liner.''
</P>
<P>
   After two weeks of trans-Atlantic bickering, the United States
reluctantly endorsed Koehler on Monday to become the next managing
director of the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's accession, following agreement by all 15 European
Union countries, ended a spectacle stemming in large part from
Germany's insistence that the job go to a German for the first time
in the IMF's 37-year history. A week earlier, President Clinton
defied the Germans' wishes by rejecting their first choice for the
job, Deputy Finance Minister Caio Koch-Weser.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler, who was on the way to IMF headquarters in Washington on
Tuesday, declined to be interviewed. But he picked up more
endorsements: from Russia and Japan, and from his prospective
counterpart at the World Bank, James D. Wolfensohn, who said that
the German would be ``a very, very good person to run the IMF.''
</P>
<P>
   To most people, Koehler is an unknown quantity. Born on Feb. 22,
1943, in Skierbieszow, Poland, he is married with two children. He
has spent most of his career in banking and finance _ for the last
two years as president of the London-based European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, which lends money to projects the
former Soviet republics and Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his professional achievements Koehler has worked largely
outside public view. That could be one of his biggest problems.
</P>
<P>
   American officials vetoed Koch-Weser partly on the grounds that,
in their view, he lacked sufficient international stature to run
the IMF, which provides emergency financing to developing and
distressed countries.
</P>
<P>
   But Koehler is hardly a neophyte. Now 57, he was a top economic
adviser to Chancellor Helmut Kohl a decade ago, as the Berlin wall
was crumbling. Without warning, he found himself in the midst of
changes of extraordinary sorts.
</P>
<P>
   As Kohl's representative to the Group of Seven industrial
nations, he led negotiations over the restructuring of billions of
dollars worth of debt left by the collapsed Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Because Germany was and remains one of Russia's biggest sources
of foreign lending, Koehler frequently sparred with the United
States over how countries would divide the burden of refinancing or
writing off old loans.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler was also the financial architect of a far-reaching deal
with Russia to evacuate its troops from the former East Germany.
Under that deal, Germany agreed to finance an enormous building
program in Russia, which would provide homes for soldiers as well
as a source of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   One of his important legacies was his work in bringing about the
economic unification of eastern Germany with the western areas.
</P>
<P>
   He provided the blueprint for Germany's currency conversion in
1990, under which the former East Germans received one West German
mark for every two of the nearly worthless ostmarks.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was harshly criticized by some economists and led to
the resignation of Karl Otto Poehl as president of Germany's
central bank. But Kohl barreled over all objections on the grounds
that the political reality of German unification would allow
nothing less.
</P>
<P>
   Germany is still groaning under the consequences. Eastern
unemployment remains nearly 20 percent, twice as high in the West,
partly because prices and wages have soared to western levels
without a comparable rise in productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler also played a big role in organizing the expensive
privatization of state businesses in the eastern Germany. As a top
official in the finance ministry, he organized the Treuhand, the
agency charged with selling 11,000 rusting and moribund companies.
</P>
<P>
   The Treuhand soon gained a reputation for catering to western
German bargain hunters. It supplied tens of billions of dollars in
taxpayer subsidies to industrial companies that either collapsed or
eliminated most of their workers.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts argue that the privatizations would have been messy
under any circumstances, and the experience in some other former
communist countries was worse.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Germany was coming to grips with reunification, Koehler
was negotiating over plans for a common European currency. His job
was to take the vaguely defined vision of a single currency and
ensure that Germany's unflinching emphasis on price stability was
dominant in all policy-making.
</P>
<P>
   That meant forcing countries like France to accept German
demands for fiscal austerity as well as an independent central
bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the structure of the European Central Bank, it
is not far from the structure of the German Bundesbank,'' said Gert
Haller, who worked closely with Koehler and succeeded him as top
adviser to Chancellor Kohl.``If we hadn't succeeded in making the
central bank the way it is now, the whole thing could not have been
sold in Germany.''

BUSH, GORE WRAP UP PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATIONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Setting the stage for what could be a close and
unpleasant national campaign, Democrat Al Gore and Republican
George W. Bush clinched their party's presidential nomination
Tuesday in six Sun Belt primaries.
</P>
<P>
   They dueled immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Gore called for quick debates and a cease-fire on
party-sponsored ads paid for with unregulated ``soft money.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, deriding Vice President Gore as President Clinton's
``cheerleader in chief,'' seemed to rule out debates until the fall
and said Clinton and Gore ``don't have any credibility'' on
campaign-finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also edged closer than previously to putting Colin Powell,
former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, near the top of his
list of vice-presidential prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it's a little early to talk about vice presidents,''
Bush said on CNN's ``Larry King Live,'' ``but there's no question
that a man of Colin Powell's stature would send a strong signal to
Americans that I know how to attract the best minds in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore ran up wide victory margins in voting in Texas,
where Bush is governor, and in Tennessee, the home state of Gore,
as well as in Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   According to The Associated Press count, Gore and Bush ended the
night with far more delegates than needed to ensure their
nomination at the parties' national conventions this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Their triumph came just a week after Gore and Bush became
prohibitive favorites to win their party's presidential nomination.
Tuesday's voting was the first major tests for both parties since
former Sen. Bill Bradley dropped out of the Democratic contest and
endorsed Gore and since Sen. John McCain suspended his Republican
challenge but refused to endorse Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I filed for president, I pledged I'd come home to Texas
with the nomination of my party,'' Bush said in remarks prepared
for delivery to supporters in Austin, Texas. ``Tonight we can say:
Mission accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in Florida, challenged Bush to debate within two weeks on
the economy, tax cuts, Social Security and Medicare. In an e-mail
to the Texas governor, Gore also said he would urge the Democratic
National Committee not to run commercials financed by ``soft
money'' contributions _ unrestricted funds that are supposed to be
used for party building _ unless Republicans air ads financed that
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to you and your party whether you want to start the
ad-war arms race,'' Gore wrote Bush. ``You have the power to join
me in banning soft money.''
</P>
<P>
   As for a quick debate, Bush said: ``There's going to be plenty
of time to debate when Americans are paying attention.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Gore was cranking up the ``old tradition'' in U.S.
politics of having ``a debate on debates.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush treated Gore's point on ``soft money'' as virtually a joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I believed him, I might be willing to accept it,'' Bush
said, pointing out that Gore and Clinton continue to raise ``soft
money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a man who went to a Buddhist temple to raise money,
and a friend of his was convicted because of that fund-raising
event, and I'm not going to let Americans forget that,'' Bush said
on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   With hundreds of delegates up for grabs Tuesday, Bush began the
day with 752 of the 1,034 delegates needed to win the nomination at
the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia this summer.
McCain had just 239 delegates, according to The Associated Press
count.
</P>
<P>
   Gore began the day with 2,014 of the 2,170 delegates needed to
win the Democratic nomination at the party's national convention at
Los Angeles in August. Bradley had 313.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore, who have been whacking at each other for weeks,
signaled anew that the general campaign had begun eight months
before the national election.
</P>
<P>
   Bush indicated he would continue to try to hang President
Clinton around Gore's neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't distance himself from the president when, for eight
years, he's served as the cheerleader-in-chief,'' Bush said in
remarks prepared for delivery to supporters in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, however, indicated he was happy to be judged on the last
eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a choice between keeping prosperity going or going back
to the Bush-Quayle days of gigantic budget deficits and paralyzed
democracy,'' Gore told The Associated Press, referring to the Texas
governor's father. Earlier in the day, Gore declared the election
``a real choice between two different ways'' of governing.
</P>
<P>
   Gore awaited returns in Tallahassee, Florida's capital, and
planned to speak to supporters at Leon High School.
</P>
<P>
   Former Reagan administration official Alan Keyes remained on the
Republican ballot but is not a factor as the primary season plays
itself out.
</P>
<P>
   The primaries came as new national polls showed Bush and Gore in
a tight race.
</P>
<P>
   Bush led Gore 49-43 percent lead among likely voters in a USA
Today-CNN-Gallup survey published Tuesday. The poll had a 5
percentage point margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's even, I like my chances,'' Bush said on ``Larry King
Live.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll, taken Friday through Sunday, had good news for Bush:
He is pulling 80 percent of McCain's Republican supporters and 46
percent of the senator's independents, while Gore gets 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, without referring to that finding, promised to fight for
votes outside his party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever energy I might feel like putting into celebrating, I
am putting into the general election instead,'' Gore said earlier
Tuesday. ``I'm going to reach out to Republicans and
independents.''
</P>
<P>
   An Associated Press analysis of exit polls in Tuesday's voting
showed, however, that Bush ran stronger in the Southern and Border
states among Democratic voters than Gore did among GOP voters. Just
6 percent of voters in Republican primaries said they would vote
for Gore in November, while twice as many Democrats said they would
defect to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In another national poll of likely voters at the end of last
week by Zogby International, Bush led Gore 45 to 41 percent, well
within the sample's margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   The Zogby survey showed Gore winning solid support among black
voters but splitting Hispanic support evenly (47-47 percent) with
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said that the vice president chose
to spend election night in Florida because he believed the state
``would be in play'' in the general campaign, despite the fact that
Bush's brother Jeb, also a Republican, is governor of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a state where Al Gore's policies translate into great
politics,'' Lehane said, referring to the vice president's more
generous proposals regarding Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's father carried Florida narrowly in 1992 as he lost the
presidency to Bill Clinton, and Clinton won the state in 1996
against Republican Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his wife, Laura, voted last week in Austin. His
parents, former President Bush and first lady Barbara Bush, voted
for their son in Houston. The former president said: ``It gets down
to family and how lucky we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore and his wife, Tipper, voted early Tuesday afternoon at
Forks River Elementary School in Elmswood, an unincorporated hamlet
near their family farm outside Carthage, Tenn.

OPPOSITION ARISES TO SCHWAB ACQUISITION OF U.S. TRUST 
</HEADLINE>
  (hm) 
 By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A community advocate group is protesting the proposed $2.7
billion acquisition of U.S. Trust by Charles Schwab, saying that
U.S. Trust has a weak record of lending in poor neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab, the discount brokerage based in San Francisco, is
seeking federal approval to take over U.S. Trust, a New York-based
bank that caters to very wealthy people.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition would be the first of its kind since Congress
passed legislation last fall that tore down decades-old barriers
that largely kept banks, securities firms and insurance companies
out of each others' businesses.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal ran into its first hurdle this week when a
Bronx-based group that frequently opposes bank mergers weighed in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The confrontation that comes up is if you are going to own
banks, you have some duty to poor people, and how are you going to
meet it?'' said Matthew Lee, director of group, Inner City
Press/Community on the Move. Lee's group was the first to comment
on Schwab's application last week to the Federal Reserve Board
seeking its blessing for the aquisition.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Community Reinvestment Act requires banks to provide
services, including loans, to even the poorest neighborhoods in
areas in which they operate.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said he would like to see Schwab lay out a plan to provide
credit to poor people in the New York area and in other parts of
the country, where U.S. Trust owns five other banks. ``Schwab's
operations are extremely banklike'' already because the firm lends
money to its customers against the value of their stocks and mutual
funds, he said.
</P>
<P>
   After buying U.S. Trust, Lee asserted, Schwab would essentially
be a bank holding company with a national network of branches that
should have to provide services to low- and moderate-income people.
</P>
<P>
   If that argument prevailed, it could create new burdens for a
variety of financial services companies, such as Merrill Lynch &AMP;
Co., that want to branch out into new businesses.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Trust did not respond to several calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   A Schwab spokesman said U.S. Trust had ``a strong record of CRA
performance.'' He said Schwab did not expect the protest to delay
the acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab should not be able to rely on U.S. Trust's claim that it
serves only wealthy customers and should be treated differently
than regular commercial banks like Bank of America, the group said.
U.S. Trust's record of lending to minorities and immigrants is
``abysmal,'' states Inner City Press' protest letter.

NATIONAL TRAINING CONFERENCE IN KANSAS CITY INVOLVES POLICE, RACE
RELATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFFREY SPIVAK  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The recent allegations of police misconduct
around the country may ultimately benefit race relations, a
criminal-law attorney and author told U.S. Justice Department
officials in Kansas City on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   John Burris, who represented police beating victim Rodney King
in a civil case, said O.J. Simpson's murder trial highlighted how
differently black people and white people viewed the criminal
justice system.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with a police corruption scandal in Los Angeles and racial
profiling becoming issues in presidential politics, Burris said
whites could better understand how African-Americans felt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whites now see there was some truth to what blacks were
responding to in the O.J. case,'' Burris said. ``It's important
that whites see these things can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Burris is author of Blue vs. Black, a recent book about police
misconduct cases. He spoke at the Westin Crown Center hotel at a
national training conference for the Justice Department's Community
Relations Service, which typically gets involved in controversial
police cases.
</P>
<P>
   Burris cited racial profiling as one police misconduct issue
gaining more attention.
</P>
<P>
   He said Democrats Al Gore and Bill Bradley were the first
presidential candidates he could remember who not only acknowledged
that racial profiling existed, but also demanded that it be
abolished.
</P>
<P>
   Burris suggested one important way to remedy police-community
conflicts was for people to become involved in police complaint
review boards.
</P>
<P>
   Although he said such boards had been ineffective because they
lacked subpoena or investigative powers, ``it's better in the long
run to have citizen oversight in policing.''

 &HT;    In race No. 6, challenger may head to runoff for Senate seat in
Texas
 &HT;    By Dave Harmon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gene Kelly, a retiree and six-time candidate who
has yet to win a general election, appeared headed for a runoff
Tuesday in the Democratic primary for U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   With 35 percent of the statewide vote counted, Kelly led the
field of five candidates with 35 percent of the vote. Former state
Rep. Charles Gandy of Austin and bank executive Don Clark of
Mesquite were vying for second place with 23 percent and 22
percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   If necessary, a runoff election for the Senate race would take
place April 11. The winner then would face Republican U.S. Sen. Kay
Bailey Hutchison in November.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison faced no opposition in her primary.
</P>
<P>
   In another Central Texas congressional race, three Republicans _
activist Ronnie ``Reeferseed'' Gjemre, physician Charles Moritz,
and Pflugerville financial consultant Jerry Mikus Jr. _ waited to
find out who will challenge U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Austin) in
the November general election for District 10, which includes most
of Austin and Travis County. Moritz led the early voting with 61
percent, followed by Mikus, who had 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, a retired military lawyer, did little campaigning.
Instead he depended on the name recognition that he said he's built
up over six previous runs for statewide office. He won the
Democratic nomination for the Texas Supreme Court in 1990, a
victory many attributed to the fact that he shares a name with the
famous dancing film star, but lost the general election to John
Cornyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good start, it's just a matter of counting,'' Kelly
said Tuesday night from his home in Universal City, near San
Antonio. ``We'll find out at the end of the evening.''
</P>
<P>
   Although few believe Hutchison can be toppled, Kelly said he
thinks Texans ``are tired of the Republicans, and she's one of
them, and I think they'll drop her.''
</P>
<P>
   Gandy said it was too early to speculate on the results, but
``I'm confident that if I get in a runoff ... I'm in pretty good
shape to win.''
</P>
<P>
   After none of the state's marquee Democrats entered the Senate
race to challenge Hutchison _ who has a $6 million campaign war
chest _ Kelly, Gandy, Clark, and two other other relatively unknown
candidates jumped into the primary.
</P>
<P>
   While Kelly waited at home, one of his opponents, Bobby
Wightman-Cervantes, watched the results from jail Tuesday.
Wightman-Cervantes, a Dallas lawyer, began serving a 90-day
sentence for contempt of court last week, a result of a 1997 letter
he wrote to a Dallas judge accusing the judge of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   In other Texas congressional races, state Rep. John Culberson
and businessman Peter Wareing raced out in the lead in early
returns in the heavily Republican 7th Congressional District,
centered in Houston. Republican National Committee member Cathy
McConn was in third. Eight Republicans entered the primary to run
for the open seat that retiring House Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Bill Archer has held since 1970.
</P>
<P>
   With no candidate expected to top 50 percent, the two top
finishers are likely to advance to an April 11 runoff. The eventual
GOP winner is considered a shoo-in against Democrat Jeff Sell in
November.
</P>
<P>
   In the race for District 11, which includes Waco, Killeen, and
Temple, three Republicans _ former Waco TV sportscaster Rob
Curnock, retired Temple oilman Ramsey Farley and Belton contractor
Rodney Geer _ vied for the nomination to challenge Rep. Chet
Edwards (D-Waco) in the fall. GOP leaders have cited Edwards as
among their top Texas challenges.
</P>
<P>
   In East Texas, actor Noble Willingham of ``Walker, Texas
Ranger'' fame sought the GOP nomination to take on Rep. Max Sandlin
(D-Marshall), who defeated a primary challenge from Paris plumber
B.D. Blount.

PATAKI PROPOSES BROAD PACKAGE OF GUN CONTROLS
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: This story is an added starter to the front page.)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Swimming against the tide of his own party, Gov.
George Pataki on Tuesday proposed a sweeping package of gun
controls, including mandatory trigger locks with gun sales, a ban
on assault weapons and steps to make it easier for the police to
trace guns used in crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control advocates say the measures, if enacted, would give
New York among the strictest gun controls in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, if you think it's the right thing, you have to
pursue it,'' Pataki told ABC News in an interview Tuesday night.
``I'm hopeful we can get this through the Legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the measures would require so-called ballistics
fingerprinting, which would record the unique markings from all new
guns so that bullets and shell casings could later be traced to
them.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, the governor called for raising the legal age
for gun purchases to 21 from 18, and said he would seek to close a
loophole in the system of background checks for gun buyers by
requiring that those checks be done on buyers at gun shows and flea
markets, not just on those who buy in stores. Aides to Pataki said
he would unveil details of his proposals at a news conference
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals are expected to pass in the Democratic-controlled
Assembly, though their fate in the Republican-dominated Senate is
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the proposals put Pataki, who harbors ambitions of
national office, at odds with the Republican leaders in Congress
and many of his fellow Republican governors. In fact, they put him
squarely in the camp of Democrats, including President Clinton, who
have been calling for many of the same measures for years. It is a
familiar position for Pataki, who favors abortion rights and gay
rights, and who recently signed into law an ambitious health care
program for the poor and a major increase in the state's cigarette
tax.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has called on Congress to require
background checks at gun shows and has proposed mandating
ballistics fingerprinting, and specific legislation is being
written by Democratic lawmakers, said Kristen Rand, the senior
council for the Violence Policy Center, a gun control group. The
gun control measure in the congressional conference committee
contains a trigger-lock provision, but gun control advocates say it
is too weak to be effective.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Morton, the spokesman for Handgun Control, said Pataki's
proposals go beyond what most other states are considering and are
important given that Pataki is a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming from a Republican governor this is revolutionary,''
Morton said. ``This is an incredible, forward-looking step in law
enforcement and crime control. It shows that this is not a partisan
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's proposals are the first significant gun control
legislation he has called for in his five years in office. Various
elements of his plan have passed the Democratic-controlled Assembly
at one time or another. ``I welcome him aboard,'' the speaker of
the Assembly, Sheldon Silver, said Tuesday night. ``We've been
doing these things for years.''
</P>
<P>
   The state Senate, where Republicans hold the majority, has
resisted gun control measures in the past, but in this election
year, the majority leader, Joseph Bruno, has expressed a
willingness to consider some measures, though he has not given any
specifics. John McArdle, a spokesman for Bruno, would not comment
on the governor's plans.
</P>
<P>
   The most innovative part of the governor's plan would require
that any new gun sold in New York be fired first, to record its
ballistic fingerprint, the pattern of nicks and scratches left on a
bullet that is unique to each weapon. Such markings are often used
by the police and prosecutors to trace a crime to a particular gun,
but first the gun must be found. Under Pataki's plan, the
ballistics patterns of all new guns would go into a database that
could be used for comparison with bullets used in crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a crime scene, people don't leave the gun very often,'' the
governor told ABC. ``But they do leave bullets or shell casings.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association has been opposed to the taking of
ballistics samples for the government, contending that it would be
a preliminary step toward national gun registration.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control has become one of the most contentious issues in
Washington, and it promises to become a big part of the
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans have generally resisted gun control
measures, though some measures, like requiring trigger locks with
gun sales, enjoy broad support.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in the wake of the Columbine High School shooting in
Colorado, each house of Congress passed its own measure that would,
among other things, close the gun show loophole. But negotiators
have made no progress toward reconciling the differences between
the two bills, and some Republican leaders have made it clear that
they think both versions go too far, saying that what is needed is
better enforcement of existing laws. Clinton has accused
congressional Republicans of intentionally stalling.
</P>
<P>
   Each highly publicized school shooting like Columbine leads to a
new round of legislative proposals for gun control, and new heights
of popularity for those proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Calls for requiring that trigger locks be included in all gun
sales have grown in the two weeks since a 6-year-old boy in
Michigan fatally shot a classmate with a pistol he found in his
home. Such a lock physically blocks the movement of the trigger,
making the gun impossible to fire without the key to the lock.
</P>
<P>
   Proposals to ban or restrict assault rifles gained momentum
after such a weapon was used in a schoolyard shooting in Stockton,
Calif., in 1989 that left five children dead.
</P>
<P>
   Rand, of the Violence Policy Center, said that while the
measures proposed by Pataki were important to improve law
enforcement and gun safety, they might not do much to dent gun
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you really want to decrease gun violence, you have to
regulate the gun industry in a more comprehensive way,'' Rand said.
``And that is difficult at the state level.''

POLICE THINK 3 ARRESTED MEN LINKED TO NATIONAL CREDIT CARD THEFT
RING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD ESPINOZA  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ It wasn't the massive purchases of perfume
and jewelry that attracted police to three men at Oak Park Mall in
Overland Park, Kan. It was the two-way radio one of them carried.
</P>
<P>
   Police now think they've cracked a national ring of thieves who
steal credit card numbers and create bogus cards, which they use to
buy merchandise for resale on the black market.
</P>
<P>
   The three California men, who allegedly used counterfeit credit
cards to buy about $13,000 worth of perfume and jewelry, are jailed
in Johnson County, Kan. Prosecutors dropped state charges Tuesday
afternoon when the U.S. marshal's office filed a federal detainer
on the men; federal charges are expected today.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Richard Medley, arriving at the J.C. Penney store to
pick up a shoplifter in an unrelated case, saw the man with the
radio. Medley thought the man might have been a security guard
until Medley mentioned the man to a store employee.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers with radios are unusual, so Medley went outside and
watched the man get into a green van and drive to another part of
the parking lot, near Nordstrom.
</P>
<P>
   Medley went back inside, where employees said the man had just
bought a $3,800 ring and about $5,000 worth of perfume with a
credit card. Police asked them to check the transactions.
</P>
<P>
   The store employees called the credit card company, which called
the legitimate cardholders and learned they knew nothing about the
purchases. Police would not say where the card numbers were stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Medley called for help, and Sgt. John Jackson blocked in the
van. Inside Nordstrom, Jackson saw three men ready to carry off
about $4,000 worth of perfume they had purchased with a credit
card.
</P>
<P>
   One of the men tried to run, said Jackson, who grabbed him and
arrested all three. Police searched the van and a Merriam, Kan.,
hotel where the men were staying and found tens of thousands of
dollars worth of jewelry, perfume and electronics, along with about
50 counterfeit credit cards. Names on the cards matched those on
fake identification cards and passports that police found.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the merchandise was packaged for shipment elsewhere in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities think the three men flew into Kansas City on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators wouldn't say how the men got the credit card
numbers, but they think they disrupted a national crime ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amounts here are staggering,'' Jackson said.

willingness to consider some measures, though he has not given any
specifics. John McArdle, a spokesman for Bruno, would not comment
on the governor's plans.
</P>
<P>
   The most innovative part of the governor's plan would require
that any new gun sold in New York be fired first, to record its
ballistic fingerprint, the pattern of nicks and scratches left on a
bullet that is unique to each weapon. Such markings are often used
by the police and prosecutors to trace a crime to a particular gun,
but first the gun must be found. Under Pataki's plan, the
ballistics patterns of all new guns would go into a database that
could be used for comparison with bullets used in crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a crime scene, people don't leave the gun very often,'' the
governor told ABC. ``But they do leave bullets or shell casings.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association has been opposed to the taking of
ballistics samples for the government, contending that it would be
a preliminary step toward national gun registration.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control has become one of the most contentious issues in
Washington, and it promises to become a big part of the
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans have generally resisted gun control
measures, though some measures, like requiring trigger locks with
gun sales, enjoy broad support.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in the wake of the Columbine High School shooting in
Colorado, each house of Congress passed its own measure that would,
among other things, close the gun show loophole. But negotiators
have made no progress toward reconciling the differences between
the two bills, and some Republican leaders have made it clear that
they think both versions go too far, saying that what is needed is
better enforcement of existing laws. Clinton has accused
congressional Republicans of intentionally stalling.
</P>
<P>
   Each highly publicized school shooting like Columbine leads to a
new round of legislative proposals for gun control, and new heights
of popularity for those proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Calls for requiring that trigger locks be included in all gun
sales have grown in the two weeks since a 6-year-old boy in
Michigan fatally shot a classmate with a pistol he found in his
home. Such a lock physically blocks the movement of the trigger,
making the gun impossible to fire without the key to the lock.
</P>
<P>
   Proposals to ban or restrict assault rifles gained momentum
after such a weapon was used in a schoolyard shooting in Stockton,
Calif., in 1989 that left five children dead.
</P>
<P>
   Rand, of the Violence Policy Center, said that while the
measures proposed by Pataki were important to improve law
enforcement and gun safety, they might not do much to dent gun
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you really want to decrease gun violence, you have to
regulate the gun industry in a more comprehensive way,'' Rand said.
``And that is difficult at the state level.''

THE GRAPES OF MARITAL WRATH
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By LISA BELKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robin Klein, a senior vice president at Chase Manhattan Bank, is
loath to let her husband go grocery shopping. ``I've tried, but
even when I make a detailed list he'll bring home the wrong brand,
or the cottage cheese that's salt-free and you can't eat,'' she
said. One memorable night he came home with two pounds of grapes
that were turning brown. ``I went ballistic,'' she remembered. ``I
was ranting like a lunatic over $3 worth of grapes.''
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to look at this scene through a ``men don't get it
and women are left doing everything'' lens. But Naomi Cahn, a
professor of family law at George Washington University, suggests
looking with a mirror instead. Cahn was immersed in her research on
workplace obstacles to gender equality recently when she was struck
by the fact that she so often interrupted her own work to, say,
make play dates for her preschool daughters. Her husband, though,
would simply go to work and do his work.
</P>
<P>
   That realization led to an article, soon to be published in The
Yale Journal of Law and Feminism, in which she argues that true
equality in the workplace is impossible without equality at home.
And among the obstacles to equality at home _ deep breath, here
comes the tricky part _ are women themselves. ``Workplace change,''
she writes, ``will be hampered until women relinquish some of the
power that they have at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, before you write the professor an outraged letter (on the
back of your own endless grocery list perhaps?), wait one minute.
She is not suggesting that this is all women's fault, or that
society in general is blameless, or that men are not a large chunk
of the problem. (To the contrary, she believes that some men _ you
know who you are _ deliberately bungle chores so no one asks them a
second time.) But she does believe that one ingredient in the
social stew is the difficulty that so many women have in giving up
certain kinds of control.
</P>
<P>
   Sociologists even have a name for this. ``It's called
`gatekeeping,' '' said Joan Williams, author of ``Unbending Gender:
Why Family and Work Conflict and What to Do About It'' (Oxford
University Press, 1999). ``It describes a situation in which a
woman really feels she should be the central person in her
children's lives.'' But given the complexities of real life,
Williams continued, a woman also ``holds her husband to the
standard of equal parenting.'' What results, she suggests, are
scuffles over things like bruised grapes.
</P>
<P>
   This talk of gatekeeping hits close to my own (well guarded)
front gate. Remember the visit that immigration workers made to the
father of Elian Gonzalez in Cuba? Among the questions they asked
was what size shoe the boy wore. Because Gonzalez knew the answer
he was deemed a fit parent. I waved a newspaper account of that
meeting like a banner at our house _ imagine, a father who knows a
child's shoe size!
</P>
<P>
   But if I looked in Cahn's mirror, I would have to admit that my
husband knows how to buy shoes. He leaves the house every day
wearing shoes he chose all by himself. And given his years of
training as a pediatrician, he even knows not to get the boys
sandals in February. So he would probably know his sons' shoe sizes
if only I would let him buy them shoes once in a while. Instead, I
have put a fence around shoe shopping (and birthday party planning
and yearly checkups and arranging play dates . . . ). Then I stand
inside the gate and vent about how I have a full-time job, too, and
why does the burden of the ``second shift'' fall on me.
</P>
<P>
   It was Arlie Hochschild who coined that phrase in her book by
the same name in which she quantified how women in the workplace
come home at night to a second full-time job. My children's shoes,
she tells me, stand for things I worry I am not doing for my boys.
Certain acts of motherhood _ usually ones we can no longer do _
``become hypersymbolized,'' she said, and ``we have to learn to let
that symbolism fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Klein, the Chase Manhattan executive, is trying. We first met
last month at a meeting of a group called Second Shift, 100
professional Westchester women who gather for dinner and
conversation twice a year. She took the microphone, sounding like a
new member at a 12-step meeting, and pledged to inch open the gate.
``I'm reminding myself `it doesn't matter if the grapes are
bruised,' '' she said to knowing laughter and applause. True, this
is not the solution to unequal pay or glass ceilings or lack of
corporate child care. But it is a start.

ANALYST PREDICTS SPRINT-MCI WORLDCOM MERGER WILL BE BLOCKED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TED SICKINGER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sprint Corp.'s proposed merger with MCI WorldCom attracted
another skeptic Tuesday, one predicting that antitrust regulators
will move to block the deal in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Cleland, a telecommunications analyst and managing
director with the Legg Mason Precursor Group in Washington, made
his prediction in a conference call with institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   He said his conclusions weren't based on any inside information
but on an attempt to analyze the merger by the same standards that
Justice Department officials will use in their review.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that in the next several months, the antitrust
division of the Justice Department is going to seek and win a
temporary injunction to halt this merger, and that will effectively
scuttle this merger,'' Cleland said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people in the market will probably be surprised when this
occurs.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprint and MCI WorldCom issued identical responses to Cleland's
comments: ``We remain convinced that the merger will go through in
the second half of 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprint is slated to mail out its proxy statement detailing its
merger arguments shortly. A special shareholders meeting to vote on
the deal is scheduled for April 28.
</P>
<P>
   Cleland's opinions are by no means universal in the analyst
community. Tony Ferrugia, an analyst with A.G. Edwards in St. Louis
and a former Sprint employee, issued a note to clients that said,
``We disagree with the opinion that Justice will deny the
WorldCom//Sprint merger.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferrugia did agree with Cleland, however, that if the merger is
blocked, there is no shortage of willing partners for Sprint,
including Deutsche Telekom and BellSouth, both of which have come
knocking before.
</P>
<P>
   Cleland offered little new information in his analysis but said
he was pulling together threads of evidence that have appeared in
various forums in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   That evidence includes what he called ``ominous process
precursors'' that key government officials have a ``clearly
negative predisposition against this merger.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited statements by Federal Communications Commission and
Justice Department officials, a leaked memo from a prominent FCC
staffer and Justice's hiring of a renowned antitrust lawyer,
Stephen Axinn, to assist in its evaluation of the merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe Steve Axinn is there for a purpose, and that purpose
is to prepare for and win in court,'' Cleland told his audience.
``Our research indicates that that's exactly what they're doing,
from the questions they're asking people around the country.
They're preparing for a court fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides his analysis of the regulatory smoke signals, Cleland
looked at the potential concentration in the Internet and
long-distance markets that would result from the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department is in the second, detailed phase of its
merger review after receiving initial filings from the companies.
Cleland said regulators would be examining three important issues:
</P>
<P>
   - Whether the merger would result in undue market concentration
that gives the combined company the ability to control pricing in
any of its businesses.
</P>
<P>
   - Whether there would be adequate competition or changing market
conditions that would allow the market to correct an
overconcentration.
</P>
<P>
   - Whether the deal could be allowed if the new company is
required to sell certain businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Cleland concluded that when the merger is subjected to the
traditional indexes that regulators use to judge market
concentration, the numbers ``are way beyond highly concentrated.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the combined company would control 50 percent of
Internet traffic and 35 percent to 40 percent of the long-distance
market.
</P>
<P>
   MCI WorldCom and Sprint long have argued that the long-distance
market is irreversibly competitive, with more than 600 competitors,
soon to be joined by the powerful regional Bell companies.
</P>
<P>
   The companies also argue that the industry pricing model is
quickly changing to ``all-distance pricing,'' where consumers pay
one price for all their calling.
</P>
<P>
   Cleland said the day of all-distance pricing might be coming but
was still years away. He also argued that only Sprint, MCI WorldCom
and AT&AMP;T Corp. have the brands, network and marketing clout to set
long-distance prices; that Sprint played an important industry role
as a pricing maverick; and that the entry of the regional Bells was
unlikely to change the competitive landscape for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Cleland also suggested that Justice would not be disposed to try
to cure the potential market concentration in the Internet by
requiring the new company to sell off Sprint's Internet business,
as has been widely predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Justice required MCI to sell off its Internet backbone when it
merged with WorldCom two years ago, a transaction that ended up in
court when the buyer said MCI failed to transfer the necessary
employees, contracts and network support to run the business going
forward.
</P>
<P>
   MCI WorldCom recently settled that case for $200 million, but
Cleland says that the company now lacks credibility with regulators
and that the department won't want to spend the energy and manpower
to make sure this deal goes as promised.
</P>
<P>
   The regulators ``aren't dumb,'' Cleland said. ``They'll realize
it was a mistake the first time around.''

CROWD CELEBRATES AS BUSH DELIVERS PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional ending) 
 
By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ To the tune of Stevie Wonder's ``Signed, Sealed,
Delivered, I'm Yours,'' about 400 Texas Republican loyalists
Tuesday night celebrated the Republican presidential nomination
that Gov. George W. Bush earned after more than a year of planning
and campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   A large-screen television at the packed Dell Jewish Community
Center gymnasium entertained the crowd with a short movie of
outtakes from Bush's year on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   It showed his appearances on the ``Tonight Show'' and ``The Late
Show With David Letterman,'' as well as Bush holding up lobsters in
New Hampshire and looking at bass in an aquarium in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever a picture of his likely presidential opponent, Vice
President Al Gore, appeared on screen, the audience booed, and they
cheered wildly as Bush declared the nomination was his.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Bush all over,'' said Patricia Adam, 59, of Navasota,
Texas, who has worked in the archives and library of Bush's father,
former President George Bush. ``I wouldn't have missed tonight for
all the tea in China, just to say I love him and all his family.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush told a home-state crowd he had clinched the GOP nomination
with primary victories Tuesday in states that included Texas and
Florida, where his brother Jeb is governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I filed for president, I pledged I'd come home to Texas
with the nomination of my party. ``Tonight we can say: Mission
accomplished,'' said Bush, with large Texas and U.S. flags draped
behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are halfway, but only halfway, to ending the Clinton/Gore
era in Washington,'' Bush said, referring to President Clinton and
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was surrounded on stage by almost all of the statewide
elected Republican officials.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison declared, ``Tonight begins a new
era in American leadership,'' while Lt. Gov. Rick Perry said Bush's
overwhelming victory in Tuesday's Texas presidential primary was an
endorsement ``by those who know him best.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bush was introduced to his election night crowd by El Paso Mayor
Carlos Ramirez, a Democrat who had supported Bush in his 1998
re-election bid as governor. Ramirez campaigned for Bush earlier
this year in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``As president, this is a man who won't just do things right,
he'll do the right thing,'' Ramirez said.
</P>
<P>
   Railroad Commission Chairman Michael Williams, a Bush appointee
who is seeking election to the office, told the crowd Bush was his
campaign manager 16 years ago when he ran for county attorney in
Midland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got soundly defeated in the Republican primary,'' said
Williams, who won the GOP nomination for his own office Tuesday.
``Governor, we're turning it around tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who was off the campaign trail Tuesday, was awakened at
6:30 a.m. CST at the Governor's Mansion by his cats, Ernie and
Willie, said spokesman Karen Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the first thing the Republican nominee did was feed his
cats,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush then made coffee for himself and his wife, Laura, Hughes
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spent part of the morning meeting with lawyers from his
general counsel's office to discuss the impending execution of
Ponchai Wilkerson, 28. Wilkerson, who was on death row for the
murder of a 43-year-old jeweler in Houston in 1990, was pronounced
dead at 6:24 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   During Bush's appearance Tuesday night, a small group of
anti-death penalty protesters briefly interrupted Bush's victory
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Bush closed his speech by praising the late Lt. Gov. Bob
Bullock, a Democrat who supported Bush in his 1998 re-election bid
and endorsed him for president before his death last year.
Bullock's wife, Jan, was on stage with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``God bless Bob Bullock, and God bless Texas,'' Bush said.

TO VICTIM'S MOTHER, SKAKEL SAYS HE IS `THE WRONG GUY' 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Spelling `Dorthy' is CQ.) 
 (bl)  
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. _ Amid a huge news media stakeout reminiscent of
the O.J. Simpson trial, Michael Skakel appeared in court for the
first time Tuesday to face the charge that he murdered Martha
Moxley, his friend and next-door neighbor, in Greenwich nearly 25
years ago, when they were both 15.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel, a nephew of Ethel Kennedy, is charged as a juvenile, and
his arraignment Tuesday was nothing more than a seven-minute
procedural hearing at which he did not even enter a plea. The only
drama came afterward, when Skakel walked to the railing by the
first row of spectators and stood face to face with Moxley's
mother, Dorthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel your pain,'' he said, looking Moxley in the eyes. ``But
you've got the wrong guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Moxley, thunderstruck, said nothing, and Skakel turned and
walked away. Later, surrounded by reporters, she said she remained
convinced of Skakel's guilt and that his comment ``was a very
rehearsed statement.'' The last time the two of them saw each other
was the morning after the killing in 1975, when Moxley, looking for
her daughter, who had not come home, knocked on the door of the
Skakel home and Michael Skakel opened it. He said he had not seen
Martha.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, outside the state Superior Court complex in Stamford,
where dozens of camera tripods stretched for more than half a block
and 14 television satellite trucks lined the street, Skakel's
lawyer, Michael Sherman, said the remark to Moxley had been
spontaneous and ``came from the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not know he was going to make that remark,'' Sherman
told the media crowd, adding: ``He did not say it in an arrogant
fashion. He didn't say it to annoy anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   But moments later, Sherman said he would allow Skakel to make
public comments ``only after his acquittal.''
</P>
<P>
   By law, juvenile judicial proceedings are closed, but in a
landmark ruling Friday, Judge Maureen Dennis granted a motion by
five newspapers to open the Skakel case to the press and to the
public. In her decision, Dennis noted that Skakel had supported the
motion and that at age 39 he no longer needed the protection of
confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, all 46 seats in the courtroom were filled Tuesday,
mostly by reporters. But for all the anticipation _ many arrived
hours in advance of the 2 p.m. arraignment _ there was little to
see. Dennis announced the murder charge, read Skakel his rights,
and recognized Sherman as Skakel's lawyer and guardian.
</P>
<P>
   Then, she scheduled a so-called reasonable cause hearing for
June 20, and the proceeding was over. Because Skakel is charged as
a juvenile, he did not have to enter a plea. At the next hearing,
prosecutors are charged with demonstrating that there is sufficient
evidence against Skakel, and they will ask Dennis to have him tried
as an adult in Superior Court in Bridgeport.
</P>
<P>
   The reasonable cause hearing, which is expected to last several
days, will provide the first opportunity for the presentation of
evidence in the case. If the case remains in Juvenile Court, it is
unclear what if any penalty Skakel will face if he is found guilty.
</P>
<P>
   But if Skakel is tried as an adult, a conviction would carry a
mandatory sentence of 25 years to life in prison. The state's
attorney in Bridgeport, Jonathan Benedict, who is the lead
prosecutor in the Skakel case, said only that he was intent on
getting the case moved to Superior Court and that he would
demonstrate reasonable cause ``through witnesses and through
evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherman would not identify the witnesses he planned to call or
the evidence he would present in defense. ``Michael's defense and
his only defense is he did not commit this crime,'' Sherman said.
``The evidence is totally insufficient to support a conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the evidence will almost certainly be the golf club that
was used to bludgeon Moxley to death on the night of Oct. 30, 1975.
The club, a 6-iron, was traced by police to a set owned by Ann
Reynolds Skakel, Skakel's mother. Mrs. Skakel, who had died two
years earlier, was the sister-in-law of Ethel Kennedy, the widow of
Robert F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Moxley, a popular blond 15-year-old, lived with her family next
door to the Skakels in a wealthy enclave in Greenwich. Her brother,
John Moxley, who was 17 at the time of the killing, said he would
like to see Skakel serve a maximum sentence. ``They have put us
through 25 years of hell,'' he said. ``Why not the same thing for
him?''
</P>
<P>
   And if all the television trucks outside the court house were
not enough to bring the O.J. Simpson case to mind, among the more
than 115 reporters, photographers, cameramen, pundits and other
gawkers was Mark Fuhrman, the former Los Angeles detective, who
wrote a book about the Moxley case called ``Murder in Greenwich''
naming Michael Skakel as the killer.
</P>
<P>
   Fuhrman has been hired by ABC as a television commentator on the
case, but outside the courthouse Tuesday he was anxiously sought
out by other television crews, including ABC competitors.
</P>
<P>
   When Mrs. Moxley came out of the courthouse, she faced a crowd
of reporters and photographers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost a miracle that we are where we are today,'' she
said, describing the quarter-century in which justice seemed
elusive. ``I still cry,'' she added. ``But I can handle it.''

 &HT;    Spring debut for Rocker easy as 1-2-3
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ Through the publicity nightmare, the strain on
his family and friends, and the walk back into a potentially
hostile Braves clubhouse, John Rocker has maintained that none of
his off-the-field turmoil would affect his pitching.
</P>
<P>
   He got his first chance to prove it on Tuesday night, taking his
first sprint from the bullpen to the mound for the ninth inning of
the Braves spring training game against the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   In front of 10,078 fans, the biggest crowd to see a game since
the Braves moved to Disney's Wide World of Sports two years ago,
Rocker was wild but effective in a scoreless ninth inning, retiring
Gregg Jefferies on a popup, Javier Cardona on a groundout and
striking out Robert Fick looking at a slider.
</P>
<P>
   And he did it predominantly to cheers, something he begrudgingly
acknowledged to the media afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason I'm talking is because Bobby (Cox) asked me
to,'' said Rocker, who was then asked how it felt to receive a
standing ovation. ``How do you think it felt? The best thing I got
out of that was maybe it finally showed you people in the media
that not everyone is against me. ... I've been well received
everywhere I go.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first trip to the mound since Game 3 of the World Series
and the first time since he incurred the wrath of countless
millions for his comments in Sports Illustrated, Rocker threw 12
pitches, six of which were out of the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked how he always looks, jacked up,'' pitching coach Leo
Mazzone said. ``He looked fine. He was up a little bit with some
high heat, but he threw good breaking stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday was Rocker's chance to gauge the progress he's made
after arriving two weeks late into spring training while he waited
on arbitrator Shyam Das's ruling. He'll pitch again Saturday in
Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel comfortable,'' Rocker said. ``I had no release
point at all. I was racking my brain to make adjustments out there
but it was the first inning I've pitched in 4 1/2 months and there
was some adrenaline going. I didn't like missing as badly as I did
with my fastball.''
</P>
<P>
   He admitted afterward, while he went in contemplating throwing
at 75 percent to 80 percent effort, he was pretty much at
full-bore.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came in pumping, giving it everything he's got,'' Cox said.
``That's the way he pitches.''

NOTHING'S FOR CERTAIN IN NCAA TOURNAMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By my own humbled estimation, I have lost enough money on NCAA
Tournament office pools to feed several Third-World countries.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least to buy them a Big Mac.
</P>
<P>
   I have never won. I have never even come close to winning. By
the night of the NCAA basketball championship game, my photocopied
bracket perennially lies crumpled in disgust at the bottom of some
trash can.
</P>
<P>
   The people who win office NCAA pools are the same ones who
wouldn't know a Cinderella from an evil stepsister. Their
``system'' is usually an amalgam of birthdates and phone numbers of
close relatives.
</P>
<P>
   True story: Few would argue that the 1985 final, won by
Villanova over mighty Georgetown, was one of the great upsets in
tournament history. Yet, a reporter at our newspaper won the office
pool by picking Villanova, with its 10 regular-season losses, to go
all the way.
</P>
<P>
   She explained later: ``I thought the name sounded pretty.
Villa-nova. It's Spanish, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Be forewarned. If you work anywhere around alleged adults, this
is a good week to stay away from the Xerox machine.
</P>
<P>
   While the American economy is forwarded to voice mail, a large
chunk of the country's labor force is pausing to perform one of two
March rituals _ prepare for its fantasy baseball draft or fill out
its NCAA Tournament bracket.
</P>
<P>
   Resistance is futile. This is the time of the year when suddenly
everybody is an expert on either Matt Mieske or Central Connecticut
State. Guys who can't remember their anniversaries can tell you
Jamie Moyer's runners-per-nine average or the names of the point
guards for all the No. 6 seeds.
</P>
<P>
   They can tell you who's hot (Arkansas) and who's not (Kansas).
They can tell you that Chris Porter (Auburn) is out, but Demtrius
Porter (Fresno State) is in. When in doubt, they'll tell you, bet
Duke.
</P>
<P>
   Duke is everyone's Get Out of Jail Free card at this time of
year. Kentucky is close behind.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid at all costs anything named Winthrop or any school whose
mascot outfit looks like a rental. If the pointspread is less than
10 points, bet the coach with the most hair. And teams wearing
green can beat teams that wear blue, but not teams that wear red.
</P>
<P>
   I told you I've never won.
</P>
<P>
   A story the other day said that an estimated $500 million will
be bet on the NCAA Tournament these next few weeks. A group in
Washington, made up of 48 members of Congress and 75 coaches, is
pushing for a bill that would ban wagering on college sports in Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Don't these people pay attention around the water cooler? The
real cash is going down this week, $5 and $10 at a time. The newest
scourge is buying into a tournament bracket over the Internet,
where one Web site is offering $10 million to anyone who picks all
63 games of the tournament correctly.
</P>
<P>
   You probably have a better chance of marrying Mark Cuban.
</P>
<P>
   There are no gimmes at NCAA Tournament time, history tells us.
Look at Cincinnati. It ran out of mulligans before the tournament
even started, relegated to a No. 2 seed despite unquestionably
earning a No. 1 with a 26-2 record.
</P>
<P>
   The word from the NCAA selection tower was that it didn't think
Cincinnati would be that good without injured star Kenyon Martin.
See? Even the NCAA committee thinks it can predict the bracket.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do they know how good we'll be without Kenyon?'' Bearcats
coach Bob Huggins asked.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is that at tournament time, everybody has $10 that
says they're an expert.
</P>
<P>
   Temple's John Chaney? Can't win; never has.
</P>
<P>
   Duke? Too many freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas? Left its Cinderella slippers at the Southeastern
Conference tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Louisville? So why is Denny Crum still walking around with his
1966 hair?
</P>
<P>
   I'd give you my picks, but it really doesn't matter. I liked
Stanford, but that loss to Arizona cooled me. I was impressed with
Iowa State, but the Cyclones will have a nasty gantlet to run.
</P>
<P>
   It really doesn't matter. When in doubt, bet the better mascot.
</P>
<P>
   Or the team that sounds Spanish. I've seen it work.

A TIMEOUT MICROPHONE FOR VAN GUNDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After a week of bitter words and expensive fines
between the National Basketball Association and its coaches
regarding the wearing of microphones, the league struck a temporary
compromise Tuesday night that, at least for one game, avoided a
messy confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Van Gundy was scheduled to wear the microphone for the
first time when his New York Knicks faced the Houston Rockets at
Madison Square Garden, but he had resisted and during the day he
received permission from his boss, James Dolan, the president and
chief executive officer of Cablevision Systems Corp., to refuse to
do so.
</P>
<P>
   When Toronto's Butch Carter and Seattle's Paul Westphal opted
not to wear microphones Sunday, their organizations were each fined
$100,000. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But after the NBA reached a compromise with the National
Basketball Coaches Association during discussions Tuesday, Van
Gundy and Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich were given the option of
wearing the microphone or allowing a boom microphone to listen in
on their huddles during timeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy chose the boom microphone and Tomjanovich, who had
voluntarily worn the microphone during two other games, chose the
microphone. ``For me, it's totally different,'' Van Gundy said
before the game. ``Now I don't have to monitor my dialogue with my
coaches or the one-on-one player dialogue throughout the game. It's
much less intrusive. It's not all the time. It's not as I'm talking
to my coaches throughout the game. It's not my reaction to a
referee's call. This is strictly in timeouts and so it's much less
intrusive. They can't use strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Without allowing his strategy to be broadcast in the
tape-delayed comments that the networks would use, Van Gundy was
asked what would be left in the huddles that could be used on
television. ``Got me,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   The microphones are only used on the national telecasts, so in
the New York area, where MSG preempted TNT, there was no miking.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Goldberg, executive director of the National Basketball
Coaches Association, worked with the league to strike the
compromise and said: ``We are seeking a way to reach a comfort
level for coaches who don't feel comfortable wearing a microphone.
This is a step in that direction, with respect to this game. This
is still on the table. But we may be on our way out of this
conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   The league will continue discussions Wednesday on whether to
make the option permanent or to revert to the original edict.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the microphone attached to a coach, he would have the
option of turning it off whenever he wanted. But Van Gundy felt
that the microphone was an intrusion he did not want to deal with
during the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be thinking about that,'' Van Gundy said. ``I
know there's some people that don't understand why coaches would be
adamantly opposed. Some are, some aren't. But I think everybody's
concerns are legitimate. I don't think coaches should have to do
something like that they believe is intrusive to their job. Coaches
like Rudy don't believe it's a problem and that's great. I think
everybody should have that chance to do what they feel is okay.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich said: ``I'm not going to say I'm completely
comfortable with it and I do believe that coaches should not be
forced to do it if they feel it in any way hurts their chances to
do their job. I think they have that right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The league came to me and they thought that it could help our
league and I'm all for that. They asked that we trust them, that it
would not be any strategy or any embarrassing type situations. And
in my experiences with them, there hasn't been anything, just human
interest, a little banter between the coach and the referee.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I do think that it's a very big responsibility on the TV
people to keep that promise, and once somebody is hurt, if that
ever happens, they should just say that we didn't stick to our plan
and scrap it.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy has argued his stand over more than just the use of
game microphones, attempting to keep the media out of practices.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy said he and the Knick organization agreed over their
distaste for the microphones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we were all united on the belief that not only wasn't
it the right decision, but the implementation, the timing of it,
there was no discussion, those were all factors that led to it.,''
he said. ``I just thought it was not handled the right way. I
appreciate their understanding of how I think.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we don't want to be fighting the NBA, because everybody
involved _ players, coaches, management _ have profited from the
NBA. It's not about fighting the NBA, but there has to be a person
at the league office, someone that will be a caretaker for the
game, who will not allow the game to be compromised for better
business. I think that's critical.'' &QL;

STARS' FERNANDEZ CHILLS THE NEGATIVITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Marc Fernandez delivered a stern lecture to his son,
Manny, on Saturday before returning to Montreal after a four-day
visit to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just wasn't too happy with the way I was thinking and
talking after the first two games,'' Manny Fernandez said, ``and he
flat out said that to me. I think that maybe got me thinking `I'm
not going to go down this easy.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' rookie goaltender hasn't either.
</P>
<P>
   After a less-than-impressive beginning to his fill-in role for
usual starter Ed Belfour, where he had an 0-1-1 mark against NHL
also-rans Vancouver and the New York Islanders, he rebounded with
back-to-back victories against the NHL-leading St. Louis Blues and
the New York Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez will make his fifth consecutive _ and likely last _
start in place of Belfour when the Stars play the Eastern
Conference-leading New Jersey Devils at 6 p.m. Wednesday in East
Rutherford, N.J..
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has got to give Manny a little bit of a break,''
Stars winger Jamie Langenbrunner said. ``It's a tough situation
stepping in and carrying the load when it's kind of unexpected like
that. And I think he's done a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   Belfour hasn't played since being charged with misdemeanor
assault and resisting arrest Wednesday. The police report stated
Belfour was intoxicated, which led to a mandatory evaluation of
Belfour by a substance abuse program sponsored by the NHL and
players' association. The evaluation was completed Sunday, but
Belfour didn't join the team until Tuesday night in New Jersey and
isn't expected to play until Saturday in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Which leaves one more big start for Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should be a confident individual right now,'' Stars coach
Ken Hitchcock said. ``He's got wins in big games and had to come up
with big saves.''
</P>
<P>
   He should be confident, but Fernandez isn't always what he
should be. Nobody was harder on Fernandez for his performance
against the Canucks and Islanders than Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
   He said he hadn't played well. He said he felt a bit nervous. He
said he felt pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Dad, along with his teammates, told him to chill. He finally
listened when Stars captain Derian Hatcher approached him after
Monday's first period.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me I was doing fine. That helped,'' Fernandez said.
``I still felt a little bit nervous, but to a certain degree I'd
like to feel a little nervous when I play.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said the change in Fernandez's mind-set has been
noticeable on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Even Fernanadez noticed, finding himself surprisingly satisfied
with Monday's 4-3 victory against the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though it finished 4-3 and three goals for me is not
really a happy zone, I thought I made some good saves,'' Fernandez
said. ``I thought I played like a No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   So when the Stars' No. 1 goalie returns on Saturday and
Fernandez returns to being a backup, it's fair to say he's going to
have some mixed emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I'm going to miss it,'' Fernandez said. ``In a way,
I'm also really glad to see him come back. This team has really
missed him over the last week.'' nn

N.Y. HIRING RULE ON TEACHERS IS RELAXED
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a move to address a looming teacher shortage in
New York City and across the state, education officials have
decided to allow credentialed teachers from most other states to
begin teaching here immediately rather than waiting until they pass
New York's certification exams.
</P>
<P>
   The state's Board of Regents quietly approved an emergency
amendment to state education regulations on March 7, giving the
Education Department the ability to grant a two-year provisional
certification to licensed teachers who move to New York from one of
39 other states or to those who have a national teaching
certificate.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was introduced to the Regents by Richard P. Mills,
the education commissioner, at the request of Harold O. Levy, New
York City's interim schools chancellor, who resigned from the Board
of Regents earlier this year when he took charge of the city's
school system.
</P>
<P>
   New York City is facing a potentially crippling teacher
shortage. A recent survey of its members by the United Federation
of Teachers found that an estimated 14,000 of New York City's
78,000 public school teachers planned to retire over the next 18
months, a far faster pace than previously predicted.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,500 teachers from other states apply for certification
in New York each year, a figure that Mills predicted could easily
double under the new standard.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers hired under the new provision will have two years to
complete the appropriate New York certification exams, which are
administered quarterly. Until now, teachers from other states might
have been discouraged from applying here, finding more lenient
policies elsewhere, education officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Although New York City has hired significant numbers of
uncertified teachers in recent years, the new policy is expected to
expand the number of applicants from other states because the
city's Board of Education will give preference to candidates with
certification, even from other states, over uncertified teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, about 10,000 New York City teachers, more than 10
percent of the total, are unlicensed. But state law will forbid the
hiring of unlicensed teachers beginning in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   New York City hires about 8,000 new teachers each year, but the
Board of Education anticipates needing 19,000 new teachers for the
school year that begins in September 2001. Over the next five
years, the United Federation of Teachers has said, 54,000 new
teachers will be needed.
</P>
<P>
   The new measure to broaden hiring from out of state is
restricted to teachers who are licensed by states and territories
that have signed an interstate agreement that defines some of the
qualifications that are necessary to obtain a teaching license.
Forty states plus the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico
are parties to the agreement. The 10 states that are not are
Alaska, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota,
South Dakota, Wisconsin and Wyoming.

EDITORIAL: CLOSING THE BOOKS ON WHITEWATER
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, March 15:
</P>
<P>
   Robert Ray, who succeeded Kenneth Starr as independent counsel,
owes the American people a final report tying up the many loose
ends of Whitewater and other aspects of a mammoth investigation
that began six years ago. The $50 million investigation covers a
range of questionable activities involving Bill and Hillary Clinton
that disappeared from public view the moment Monica Lewinsky came
along. As a matter of both law and common sense, the public
deserves a summing up _ delivered in one piece and delivered
promptly.
</P>
<P>
   However, Ray has reportedly chosen to release this information
bit by bit in a series of reports over the coming months. This
drawn-out procedure is sure to become a source of continual
disruption throughout this year's election campaigns, and it
violates accepted notions of fair play. Ray is also said to have
reopened the possibility of indicting the president after he leaves
office on the same charges involved in the impeachment drama _
whether he lied under oath to a grand jury, and whether he asked
Lewinsky to lie about their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   This page has consistently backed a thorough investigation of
the multiple accusations against the Clintons and a full airing of
its findings. But at this very late date in the proceedings the
issue of proportionality and timeliness loom large. The independent
counsel's office has had virtually unlimited resources and years of
time to conduct its inquiry. Surely Ray has the staff and
sufficient information to complete a final report in short order if
he sets his mind to it.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there any reason for the prosecutor to pursue Clinton
when he leaves office. The charges against him were fully
adjudicated in the impeachment trial before the Senate, the forum
designated by the Constitution for dealing with presidential
misdeeds. The Senate trial was exhaustive and obviates the need for
further legal action. A report in Monday's Times by Neil Lewis
suggests that Starr himself may have reached the same conclusion,
namely that the proper forum for all these charges was the
impeachment battle and that there was no need for any separate or
subsequent criminal proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Times story, Ray plans three reports between
now and the fall. The first will involve the White House's improper
acquisition of about 900 FBI files, including dossiers of prominent
Republicans. This report is likely to conclude that the so-called
``Filegate'' scandal involved no criminal wrongdoing and resulted
from unwitting mistakes by low-level White House aides.
</P>
<P>
   The second and third reports could be more problematical for
Hillary Rodham Clinton. One will deal with the firing of several
longtime employees of the White House travel office shortly after
the Clintons came to power. Mrs. Clinton has said she had little to
do with the episode, while others have told investigators that the
first lady played a central role.
</P>
<P>
   The third and final report will cover a range of activities
falling under the heading ``Whitewater'' _ the Arkansas real estate
deals that originally attracted the attention of the press,
Congress and the Justice Department and led to the appointment of
an independent counsel six years ago. This report would cover
important unanswered questions involving Mrs. Clinton's billing
records from her days as a lawyer in Little Rock as well as her
sworn testimony about her role in Whitewater and other
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel's office owes its judicial overseers _
and through them the nation at large _ a complete report of its
findings. But that report should be delivered to the judges now, so
that it can be processed and released early in the election
campaign. That will give the political process time to assess the
implications for the candidacies of Mrs. Clinton and Vice President
Al Gore and respond to the findings.
</P>
<P>
   Such a report, expeditiously delivered, would be consistent with
the statutory responsibilities of the independent counsel. A series
of reports extending well into the election season would raise
serious questions about Ray's motives and could well undermine the
credibility of his work.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, March 15:
</P>
<P>
   The trend toward consolidation of newspaper ownership is by no
means new, but Tribune Co. of Chicago's agreement to purchase Times
Mirror Co. offers several lessons about the economic and
journalistic issues involved in today's mergers.
</P>
<P>
   One is that the concept of ``newspaper chains'' is rapidly
becoming outdated by investor and marketing pressures to form
multimedia companies that stretch across newspapers, broadcasting
and the Internet. Tribune Co., which will now own 11 daily
newspapers, 22 television stations and a major share of America
Online, has been one of the most aggressive of traditional media
companies in exploring ways to expand its reach. This $6.45 billion
acquisition positions it powerfully for the new game of finding
multiple uses for content from one medium _ newspapers, for example
_ in other media, say its broadcast and Internet outlets. This
convergence of content from different media has huge implications
for publishing, programming, advertising and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The new media environment has also touched off a churning debate
among journalists about professional standards and the task of
insulating news coverage from commercial pressures. Some members of
The Los Angeles Times, including its highly regarded former
publisher, Otis Chandler, saw the takeover by The Chicago Tribune's
parent company as a positive sign. For the past five years the
Times Mirror chairman, Mark Willes, a former cereal company
executive, had tried to dismantle the traditional wall between the
editorial and business sides of The Los Angeles Times. While Willes
drove up Times Mirror stock, he lost the confidence of the paper's
journalists and drew Chandler's public condemnation. Now the
combined company's newspaper operations will fall under the
direction of Jack Fuller, president of Tribune Co.'s publishing
unit and a former editor who has written extensively about
preserving journalistic standards in the new media environment.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is shock in Los Angeles that the Chandler family,
which owned the paper for 119 years and helped shape the city and
state, was no longer in control, just as there was shock in Boston
when The New York Times Co. purchased The Globe from its longtime
owners, the Taylor family, in 1993. The Chandler family's share of
the new company is worth over $1 billion at current stock values,
but the newspaper industry _ and family-controlled newspapers like
this one _ will read a managerial as well as a financial lesson
into Times Mirror's decision to sell. Discord among the family
shareholders led to the Willes regime in Los Angeles and ultimately
to a change in ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Many smaller papers, such as The Louisville Courier-Journal,
have fallen victim to such disunity, but no one had expected the
largest and most important newspaper in the West to change hands so
abruptly. Then again, no one expected the newspaper that was made
into a national force by Chandler to experience the journalistic
turmoil brought about by Willes. &QL;

WILLIAM COLVIG, 82, MUSICAL INSTRUMENT BUILDER  
(HM)
</HEADLINE>
   By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   William Colvig, an instrument builder who collaborated with
composer Lou Harrison on gamelans and other percussion instruments
and who was Harrison's companion for 33 years, died March 2 in
Capitola, Calif. He was 82 and lived in Aptos, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Colvig was born in Medford, Ore., in 1917. Although he sometimes
described himself as an amateur musician, he studied the piano,
trombone, baritone horn and tuba while he was growing up in Weed,
Calif., and he won a scholarship to study music at the University
of the Pacific in 1934. But he soon decided to study electrical
engineering instead, and in 1937, he transferred to the University
of California at Berkeley. He continued his studies at Berkeley for
two years before joining an expedition of naturalists traveling in
the Yukon.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, he served in the Army on radar
installations in Alaska. He returned to California after the war
and worked as an electrician in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   He became involved at that time with the Sierra Club. He later
became a guide and a leader of backpacking expeditions for the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Leta E. Miller, the co-author, with Fredric Lieberman, of ``Lou
Harrison: Composing a World,'' wrote that Colvig and Harrison met
after a concert of Harrison's works in 1967 and that they quickly
discovered they had common interests in music, acoustics and
politics. They had both been early supporters of KPFA Radio, a
nonprofit pacifist radio station in Berkeley, and they were both
members of the Society for Individual Rights, a San Francisco group
that promoted gay rights. A few weeks after they met, Colvig moved
into Harrison's woodland cabin in Aptos.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison had by then become interested in the sound of the
Indonesian gamelan orchestra _ an ensemble of pitched percussion
instruments _ but had found that importing an authentic gamelan was
prohibitively expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Together, Colvig and Harrison began building a gamelan, based
partly on traditional Indonesian designs and partly on using found
objects. Aluminum slabs, tin cans, electrical conduits and empty
oxygen tanks, cut to various sizes and struck with sawed-off
baseball bats, replaced the gongs of the Asian gamelan.
</P>
<P>
   Colvig and Harrison called their instrument the American
gamelan. It was first used in Harrison's work, ``La Koro Sutro,''
in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Colvig and Harrison built several other gamelans, as well as
harps, bowed stringed instruments and percussion instruments.
Besides being used in performances of Harrison's music, the
instruments have been shown in several exhibitions. Two of their
gamelans were bought by San Jose State University and Mills
College.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Harrison, Colvig is survived by two sisters,
Donna Straight of Auburn, Calif., and Claire Oberon of Paso Robles,
Calif.; and three brothers, David of San Francisco, Richard of
Oakland, Calif., and Ray of Berkeley.

CLEMENCY IS DENIED POLAND

(FLORENCE) _ Patrick Poland leaned forward and in a shaking voice
spoke to the families of the men he killed nearly 23 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say I'm sorry. I've lived with this every day, and I
wish I could just go back in time,'' Poland, 50, said. ``I hope
everyone can accept my apology, understand me and forgive me.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite Poland's remorse and passionate pleas to save his
life, the Arizona Board of Executive Clemency voted 4-1 on Tuesday,
March 14, to go ahead with Poland's execution.
</P>
<P>
   He is scheduled to die by lethal injection at 3 p.m. today,
March 15, at the state prison in Florence for killing armored-van
guards Cecil Newkirk and Russel Dempsey in May 1977. Poland would
be the 21st inmate executed in Arizona since the state resumed
capital punishment in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel for Patrick Poland and I hope he can truly repent for
what he did,'' Newkirk's grandson, Cecil III, said after the
hearing. ``I'm sure if he could go back, things would be different
but, unfortunately, it can't be like that. He has to serve (his
sentence) for what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Poland's attorney, Tom Gorman, filed a last-minute appeal with
the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday, March 14, night. A decision is
expected today, March 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's it. That's the highest court there is,'' Gorman said.
``We're hoping they will grant us a stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's, March 14, eight-hour hearing was marked by tearful
pleas for mercy and heartbreaking stories of abuse that Poland
suffered as a child at the hands of his father. Three of his
siblings, including his twin brother Jeff, and his two children
spoke on his behalf. So did two prosecutors and the FBI agent who
once rallied to put Poland on death row.
</P>
<P>
   All wanted Poland's death sentence reduced to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look in my father's eyes and I've got so much love for him,
and I feel like I'm 4 years old again,'' said Guy Poland, Patrick's
son. ``I love my father so much I can't even imagine being here
without him.''
</P>
<P>
   Several times during breaks Tuesday, March 14, Guy and his
sister, Stacey, looked toward the enclosed chamber where their
father sat, and mouthed, ``I love you, Dad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were realistic and we knew it probably wouldn't happen,''
Stacey said after the board's decision. ``Everything that could
have been done has been done.''
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, Guy and Stacey said their final goodbyes
through the glass of a visitation booth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love him. He knows that,'' Stacey said. ``And I told him to
give me a kiss.''
</P>
<P>
   Poland has asked that his family not witness his execution.
</P>
<P>
   Poland and his brother, Michael, posed as highway patrolmen to
pull over a Purolator Inc. armored van, steal $288,000 and kill
both guards. They then drove 250 miles to Lake Mead, wrapped
Newkirk and Dempsey in custom-made canvas bags weighted with rocks
and dropped them from a rented boat to a watery grave.
</P>
<P>
   Newkirk's widow said in a letter to the board that ``the Poland
brothers cheated my husband from many years of happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Does this man deserve to die?'' Lola Newkirk wrote. ``Yes, he
does! He must pay with his life! This will not bring back my dear
husband, but justice must be served.'' &QL;

WEBB IS THE PLAYER TO BEAT IN LPGA 
</HEADLINE>
  (hm) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Karrie Webb has won every tournament she has entered this year,
something that even Tiger Woods has not done.
</P>
<P>
   While Woods' exploits have dominated headlines in the golf
world, Webb has also been brilliant, winning all three of her tour
starts this year. If Webb wins this week's Standard Register Ping
in Phoenix, she will become the first woman since JoAnne Carner in
1982 to win four consecutive tour starts.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Lopez holds the career Ladies Professional Golf
Association record with five consecutive winning starts in 1978,
and considering the way Webb has played, Lopez's streak does not
seem out of reach. Webb has actually won four consecutive starts,
but her victory in last month's Australian Ladies Open was not an
official LPGA event.
</P>
<P>
   At age 25, Webb already has 19 career victories on the tour, and
she is clearly a cut above her peers. But with Woods riding a
six-start winning streak earlier this year, Webb's exploits have
been somewhat overshadowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has left me some privacy, but the only thing that annoys me
is that the LPGA hasn't gotten as much publicity from it as they
probably should have,'' Webb said during a national conference call
on Tuesday. ``We have great players, and we have just as good a
show as the PGA Tour does.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're never going to hit it as far as the men, but with a
five-iron in our hand, we can hit it just as close as the average
guy can. The average golfer can relate to us much more than they
can to Tiger Woods hitting it 350 yards. The average male golfer
can watch us play, see us hit from positions that he would be in,
and watch us hit clubs he would hit. People just need to come watch
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching Webb play these days means watching a great player at
her best. One of the tour's longest hitters, Webb switched to a
cross-handed putting style at the beginning of last year and raised
her game to a new level. She won six times last year en route to
the player of the year award, and she set a career record for the
single-season scoring average, 69.99.
</P>
<P>
   Webb has lowered that scoring average to 69.22 this year, and
her improved putting has made her even more aggressive and more
confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say 70 to 80 percent of the reason why I've played so well
is because of my putting,'' said Webb, a native of Australia who
lives in Florida. ``I've seen so many more putts go in. Now, I can
miss a green and still get it up and down. Before, I didn't feel
like I was making as many putts as I should, so if I missed a
green, I'd be afraid of making bogey. And my short game has gotten
better. I'm not scared to hit it by the hole if I have a tough
chip, because I know I can make the putt coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb took last week off, when Annika Sorenstam qualified for the
LPGA Hall of Fame by winning the Welch's/Circle K Championship.
Sorenstam will not officially become a member of the Hall of Fame
until she fulfills the requirement of playing 10 years on the tour.
</P>
<P>
   The rivalry between Webb and Sorenstam, however, could be a
boost to the tour if both players have big years. They already went
head-to-head at the Takefuji Classic earlier this month, when Webb
defeated Sorenstam on the first hole of a playoff. Both Webb and
Sorenstam will play this week and at next week's Nabisco
Championship, the first LPGA major of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``My relationship with Annika is that we're friends at the golf
course,'' Webb said. ``I don't know Annika away from the course,
but I have a lot of respect for her game. Her making the Hall of
Fame was a given.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb appears destined for that honor as well, and she would love
to continue her current streak. Like Woods, Webb enjoys an
advantage these days when her name appears on the leader board.
This week and every week, everyone in the field knows she is the
player to beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when players see my name on the leader board, they
know there's a good chance I'll stay on the leader board,'' Webb
said. ``It's the same for me when I see Annika or Juli Inkster's
name. I know they won't go away. Instead of making pars, other
players have to think about making birdies.'' &QL;
