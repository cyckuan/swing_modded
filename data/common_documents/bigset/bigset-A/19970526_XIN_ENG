<HEADLINE> International Climbers' Meet to Be Held in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 25 (Xinhua) -- An international climbers' meet
is to be held in Nepal on Wednesday to mark the first human ascent
of the world highest Mt. Qomolangma 44 years ago, organizers said
here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The three-day event will have some 60 climbers and
mountaineering agencies from more than 20 countries and regians,
including Britain, China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Mongolia,
Russia and Switzerland, said Dawa Norbu Sherpa, president of the
Nepal Mountaineering Association (NMA).
</P>
<P>
The climbers' meet is the largest event in the mountaineering
field of Asia since the 50th general assembly of the Union of
International Alpinist Association (UIAA), which incidentally was
held here in 1982.
</P>
<P>
In addition to commemorate the first ascent of the 8,848-meter
Qomolangma summit by Nepali climber Tenzing Norgay and British
Edmund Hillary via the South Face on May 29, 1953, the meet will
also discuss the problems and trends facing current Himalayan
climbing activities, Sherpa said.
</P>
<P>
Among the participants are also French veteran Maurice Herzog,
who first ever scaled a Himalayan mountain above 8,000 meters in
the 1950, and Swiss geologist Toni Hagen, who has contributed most
of his life to the geoloical study of Himalayas, he added.
</P>
<P>
A 10-point declaration adopted by the 1982 UIAA meeting on the
protection of mountain culture and environment will also be
reviewed during the meet.
</P>
<P>
The participants will visit the site of the International
Mountain Museum, which is under construction in western Nepali
city of Pokhara, about 120 km west of Kathmandu.
</P>
<P>
The NMA hopes that the International Climbers' Meet would help
garner International support for future NMA programs like clean-up
of Mt. Qomolangma and other expedition peaks and training of local
youth mountaineers, accordiong to Sperpa.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Migrants Must Register or Face Deportation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The estimated 500,000 illegal
migrants living in Greece will have to apply for temporary
residence permits or face deportation by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Labor Minister Miltiadis Papaioannou said that the temporary
residence permits would be issued as early as July, the Athens
News reported today.
</P>
<P>
He said that illegal migrants should not fear registration
since it would allow them to live and work freely in Greece for
one year.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the temporary permits would be issued in
the first phase of new legislative measures aimed at a limited
legalization of the country's illegal migrants.
</P>
<P>
Under the second phase, migrant workers would be allowed to
receive Limited Duration Cards, valid for between six months and
three years, and renewable for a maximum of five years.
</P>
<P>
The legislation comprises two draft presidential decrees,
which will come into effect after being approved by the
appropriate ministers, the Council of State, and signed by
President Costis Stephanoupoulos.
</P>
<P>
Both decrees, which were drafted by the Labor Ministry, have
currently been reviewed by the Economic and Social Council.

<HEADLINE> Syrian-Iraqi Relations Likely to Be Improved, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Syrian-Iraqi ties are likely to be
improved after a high-level Syrian businessmen delegation visited
Iraq last week, reliable sources here told Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
It was the first high-level Syrian delegation to visit Baghdad,
the capital of Iraq, since diplomatic relations between the two
countries were severed in 1980.
</P>
<P>
During its four-day visit, the delegation headed by Rateb
El-Shallah Chairman of the Federation of Syrian Chambers of
Commerce reportedly held talks with Iraqi officials on ways of
promoting trade exchange between the two countries in accordance
with the U.N.-Iraqi oil-for-food deal signed on May 20, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian delegation arrived in Baghdad across the Abul Shamt
post on the Syrian-Iraqi border which was closed in 1981, one year
after the outbreak of the Iraq-Iran war (1980-1988).
</P>
<P>
The head of the delegation told reporters that traffic on the
road linking Syria with Iraq would be resumed soon, and that
there would be positive effects for the exchange visits by trade
delegations of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Mohammed Rashid expressed his hope
during his meeting with the Syrian delegation that the
delegation's visit would be a prelude to opening prospects of
mutual oil cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Political observers said that the delegation's visit is an
indicator of a Syrian-Iraqi rapprochement, and that the
improvement of trade relations between Syria and Iraq will help
improve the bilateral political relations.
</P>
<P>
The reliable sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
that the delegation's visit was crowned with success, because Iraq
agreed in principle to import Syrian foods and medicines across
the joint border, and Syria is likely to let Iraq use the Syrian
ports overlooking the Mediterranean Sea.
</P>
<P>
The visit came at a time when the Mideast peace process is
stalled and Israeli-Turkish military cooperation is being
heightened. Turkish troops are currently penetrating into northern
Iraq to repress its outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), which
has been fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey since 1984.
</P>
<P>
Arab states have complained that the military cooperation
between Israel and Turkey targets the Arab nations and threatens
the security of the Arab states, especially that of Syria.
</P>
<P>
Under these circumstances, Syria has made intensified
diplomatic efforts intended to promote Arab solidarity, the
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
During a recent trip to five of the six GCC countries, which
groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain and the United
Arab Emirates (UAE), Syrian Vice President Abdul-Halim Khaddam
declared that Syria condemned the offensive launched by Turkish
troops into northern Iraq and supported the unity of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed sanctions on Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait
in 1990. The oil-for-food deal which began in December allows Iraq
to sell limited oil to buy food and medicine for its people.

<HEADLINE> Iran Invites Saddam to Tehran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani said here today that he has already prepared an
invitation letter to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to the OIC
summit in Tehran in December.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said at a press conference that "the letter will
soon be going and I will invite all the leaders of the Arab world
to the summit (of the Organization of Islamic Countries)."
</P>
<P>
As for Iraq's problem, the Iranian president said that "we are
upset. The Iraqi people are suffering now as the Iranian people
were in the past."
</P>
<P>
"We hope the shadow of the United States will be gotten rid of
so the people of Iran and the Iraq could live in friendship," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati has already
delivered the invitation letter of President Rafsanjani to heads
of more than 20 countries. Some of the heads have replied with OK.
</P>
<P>
Salah N. Al-Samarmad, charge d'affaires of the Iraqi embassy,
said last month that the Iraqi president will not come to Tehran
despite the invitation by Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Samarmad said, one of Iraq's vice-presidents will
come to Tehran for the OIC summit.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that Velayati will go to Baghdad and
deliver Rafsanjani's invitation to President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi diplomat said that the forthcoming visit by the
Iranian foreign minister will indicate the improvement of
relations between Baghdad and Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Iraq fought a bloody war from 1980 to 1988. Iran
claimed earlier that the damages inflicted by the eight-year Iraqi
imposed war on Iran totals 1,000 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Iran Voices Concern Over Turkey-Israel Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani today expressed concern over the Turkey-Israel
alliance and Turkish presence in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani described the two latest developments as "new
problems" and called for "vigilance and caution."

Turkish forces' action into northern Iraq, saying "We oppose the
violation of the borders of the countries by other countries."
</P>

Velayati said "We strongly believe that the territorial
integrity of Iraq must be preserved. Whoever violates territorial
integrity must be stopped."

<HEADLINE> Zambian President Calls for Efforts to End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
today called on African leaders to make necessary efforts to
settle conflicts on the continent through negotiations and
dialogues.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba made the remarks when adressing a rally to mark the
34th anniversary of the founding of the Organization of African
Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
"The ideals of peace, security and stability the the founding
fathers of the OAU envisaged for Africa are increasingly coming
under threat with the escalation of conflicts in different parts
of our continent," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Conflicts continuously threaten to drain our lives, cause
immense suffering by generating hundreds of thousands of refugees
and displaced persons" and divert the meager resources meant for
African socio-economic development to the civil wars, he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on African leaders to try to to create "a new
African order that will have its people living in relative peace
and stability and in prosperity."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he noted the economic reforms by African countries
for obliterating adverse socio-economic conditions remain at the
top of the continent's agenda, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the economic and structural reforms in Africa will
initialy have negative impacts, particularly in terms of social
costs, on the vulnerable groups of the society before
achievements emerge, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba pointed out that the African economic and social
advancement cannot be attained by a country alone but needs
concerted international efforts.
</P>
<P>
He added the regional economic blocs like the Southern African
Development Community#,Common Market for Eastern and Southern
Africa and Economic Community for West African States play active
roles in getting overall economic development and integration of
Africa.

<HEADLINE> Minister: Egypt Sets No Preconditions for Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
said today President Hosni Mubarak did not set any preconditions
for his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Binjamin Netanyahu to
be held in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Telling reporters today, Moussa dismissed reports alleging
Mubarak has attached to the summit a precondition that Israel
halts the construction of a new Jewish neighborhood in Arab East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
He said the Sharm el-Sheikh summit talks will focus on means of
giving impetus to the peace process on the Palestinian-Israeli
track, which collapsed in mid-March when Israel carried out the
Har Homa settlement project in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has made it clear that he will
not resume talks unless the issue of settlement is dealt with.

"The objective of the Egyptian diplomacy at present is to
salvage the peace process and tackle reasons that led to the
current deadlock," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that a move on this track would lead to activating the
other peace tracks," he added.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has reportedly proposed a five-point initiative, under
which there should be a political solution to the Har Homa issue,
instead of a temporary suspension of house building.
</P>
<P>
The plan also envisages the resumption of Palestinian-Israeli
security cooperation, a halt to Jewish settlement in the West
Bank, the immediate resumption of talks on further Israeli troops
redeployment in the West Bank and the start of final status talks
between the Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
It is unknown whether the Egyptian proposal has been endorsed
by Arafat, but Netanyahu office denied that Israel is ready to
freeze the construction in a move to end the two-month-old crisis
with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said all parties are exerting efforts to make Netanyahu
give up his insistence on peace for peace instead of the
land-for-peace principle. But he added "we will see what he has to
offer."
</P>
<P>
Mubarak sent his top advisor Osamz el-Baz to Israel today for
talks with Netanyahu in preparation for the summit and possibly on
new proposals for reviving the flagging peace process.
</P>
<P>
On the possibility of cancellation of Tuesday's summit if Egypt
failed to obtain Israeli concessions, Moussa said Egypt is still
waiting for a report from Baz on the outcome of his meetings with
Israeli officials.
</P>
<P>
"We will not speak of such a contingency now as we are awaiting
Baz's report and outcome of current contacts," he added.
</P>
<P>
In reply to a query on a recent Israeli decision to suspend
demolishment of Palestinian houses in the West Bank and Gaza,
which Israeli officials hail as a good-will gesture, Moussa said
"all these reports need confirmation first."
</P>
<P>
"The important thing is the peace process and eliminating
causes that led to its stalemate especially the issue of
settlement," he added.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to make peace with Israel in
1979, has been a key mediator in the Mideast peace process.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Northern Warlord Vows to Continue Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Afghan northern Warlord Rashid
Dostum said here today that his forces will continue to fight in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Dostum said this to reporters following his 40-minute-long
meeting with Turkish State Minister Abdullah Gul in Stad Hotel in
Ankara where Dostum is sheltering himself.
</P>
<P>
Dostum arrived here today after his headquarters,
Mazar-e-Sharif, fell to the Afghan Islamic militia Taliban Saturday.
</P>
<P>
When asked how long he would stay in Turkey, Dostum said that he
would stay in Ankara until his injured arm recovers.
</P>
<P>
He said that he has not submitted a request to the Turkish
government for political asylum.
</P>
<P>
Dostum added that he did not receive military or financial
support from the Turkish government, but political support.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gul, main aide of Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan,
told reporters that "I am very sad about the war in Afghanistan."
He expressed the hope that Turkey will make efforts to bring peace
in that country.
</P>
<P>
Taliban fighters on tanks took over Mazar-e-Sharif Saturday,
according to reports reaching here.
</P>

Dostum, who controlled six provinces in northern Afghanistan,
escaped by helicopter Saturday to Tashkent, capital of the
neighboring Central Asian country of Uzbekistan.

<HEADLINE> Israeli President, PM Hold Talks with Egyptian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman
and Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu held talks here today with
a senior Egyptian official ahead of the upcoming summit between
Netanyahu and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's foreign policy adviser Dore Gold also met with
Osama Al-Baz, Mubarak's political adviser, in an effort to pave the way
for the summit scheduled for Tuesday at Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
No details have been released regarding Al-Baz's second round
of talks in Israel in three days, following his two-hour meeting
with Netanyahu Friday. The Egyptian official is due to return to
Egypt later today to report to Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said today in
Cairo, the capital of Egypt, that no preconditions were set by
Mubarak for the summit, which is aimed at breaking the deadlock
in Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Netanyahu's spokesman Shai Bazak denied reports of a
proposal by the Egyptian president to halt construction of a new
Jewish neighborhood in Jerusalem's Har Homa as part of a package
to restart peace talks with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media reports said today that Al-Baz was to present
Netanyahu an initiative which apparently has the support of the
Americans, Europeans, and Jordan's King Hussein, who met with
Mubarak Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Under this plan, the Palestinians will resume the security
cooperation with Israel and fight terrorism, and a political
solution will be worked out for the construction on Har Homa,
with construction there to be halted temporarily.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the talks between the Israelis and Palestinians on
a fast-track final-status agreement and on the second pullback of
the Israeli army in the West Bank will be resumed.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian sources said Mubarak agreed to meet Netanyahu
only after he received signals that Israel will be ready for the
compromise he proposes, namely freezing construction on Har
Homa.
</P>
<P>
However, Israeli Cabinet secretary Danny Naveh said today
that the construction at Har Homa will continue as part of the
government's policy to strengthen Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between the Israelis and Palestinians came to
a halt in March after Israel started to build the controversial Jewish
neighborhood at Har Homa on the southeastern outskirts of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians have said that Israel must stop the construction
before talks can resume, while Israel has been insisting that
the Palestinian National Authority must crack down on terrorism and
reestablish full security cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Iraq, Syria to Reopen Highway Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 25 (Xinhua) -- An Iraq-Syria highway, closed
for traffic many years ago, will reopen soon to handle Iraq's food
and medical purchases under its oil-for-food deal with the U.N.,
a local English newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Baghdad Observer quoted Rateb al-Shallah, chairman of the
union of Syrian chambers of commerce, as saying that "the land
highway which links Iraq and Syria would start its activity soon
for the interests of both countries."
</P>
<P>
Shallah made the remarks during his three-day visit to Baghdad
earlier this week. The visit by the six-member Syrian trade and
industrial delegation to Iraq was believed to be the first since
early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The Iraq-Syria land road was closed immediately after Baghdad
severed diplomatic relations with Damascus in 1980 because Syria
sided with Iran in the 1980-88 Iraqi-Iranian war. The bilateral
trade and economic ties have been cut since then.
</P>
<P>
The relations between the two countries further worsened since
Syrian troops joined in the 1991 Gulf War against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The only outlet for Iraqis traveling to the outside world
and imports of goods exempted from the U.N. sanctions imposed
since 1990 is the 1,000-kilometer desert road between Baghdad
and Amman, the capital of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Under the Iraqi-U.N. memorandum known as "oil-for-food" deal
signed last May, Iraq is allowed to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars
worth of oil over six months to buy food and medicines.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Iraqi senior officials, including Oil
Minister Amir Mohammed Rashid and Minister of Commerce Mohammed
Mehdi Saleh, Shallah said his visit was aimed at establishing
cooperation and bringing back the normal trade and industrial ties
between Syria and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian delegation's visit coincided with Syrian leaders'
efforts to build a strong Arab front against Turkey, which enjoys
closer military ties with Israel and is carrying out a large-scale
operation against Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq near Syrian
border.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Official Renews Demand on Halting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Ahead of Tuesday's
Israeli-Egyptian summit aimed at reviving the Israeli-Palestinian
peace process, a senior Palestinian official reiterated today
Israel must halt settlement activities before resuming the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio, chief Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat expressed his doubt about the outcome of
the summit between Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, which is due to be held Tuesday
in the Egyptian Red Sea resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and Mubarak are to discuss ways of reviving the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks which have been deadlocked since
Israel began building the Har Homa settlement in East Jerusalem
in March. Mubarak's senior adviser Osama Al-Baz traveled to
Jerusalem today for the second time in three days to prepare for
the Tuesday's summit.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptians are reportedly proposing a temporary halt to
the Har Homa project as a confidence-building measure aimed at
bringing the peace process back on track, but this has been
rejected by Israel's Prime Minister's Office Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Israel's refusal to halt the Har Homa
construction, Erekat stressed that as long as Israel continued
expanding settlements, the peace process could not move forward.
</P>
<P>
He said that it depends solely on Netanyahu if the Tuesday
summit could produce any results, adding that "the Egyptians have
put everything on the line to restore the peace process. I think
the chance is in Netanyahu's hands now on what to do: (whether) to
comply (with) or respond to the plea of President Mubarak
concerning the freeze on settlements."
</P>
<P>
Warning Israel's intransigency on settlements is leading many
Israelis and Palestinians to think that the peace process was
dying, Erekat said Netanyahu should figure out the current
situation correctly.
</P>
<P>
He urged Netanyahu not to use the Tuesday summit for
launching a public relations campaign, but to make genuine
efforts to save the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"I hope this time he (Netanyahu) will act with wisdom, sanity
and statesmanship that are required to put the peace process
back on track," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli rightist lawmakers from the pro-settlement
Land of Israel Front today threatened to topple the Netanyahu
government if it conceded to the Arab demand on suspending the
Har Homa construction.
</P>
<P>
Shaul Yahalom, a lawmaker from National Religious Party, said
that if Netanyahu agreed to halt the Har Homa project even for
24 hours, it could not be resumed even after 24 months.

<HEADLINE> 1,750 PKK Killed in Turkey's Cross-Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- At least 1,750 rebels of the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) have been killed since the
Turkish cross-border military operation started in northern Iraq
on May 14, Turkey's private Show TV reported this evening.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the Turkish government troops had
destroyed the Zap base, one of the most important bases of the PKK
guerrillas in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish security forces erected a Turkish national flag in
the Zap area where the PKK militants once sheltered themselves in
the region, said the report.
</P>
<P>
About 50,000-strong Turkish troops crossed the border into
northern Iraq on May 14 following a call for aid by Iraq's
Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) leader Mesud Barzani.
</P>
<P>
Senior military sources here have said that Turkish government
troops would not pull out of northern Iraq until the region is
swept free of the PKK members.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the PKK had suffered the heaviest blow in
this cross-border military operation compared with the previous
ones.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish operation has drawn strong criticism from the
United Nations, some western countries and Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a 13-year-old separatist war which
has claimed over 23,000 lives in eastern and southeastern Turkey
since August 1984.

<HEADLINE> Israel Halts Destruction of Palestinian Homes in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Israel announced today to
suspend destroying illegally-built Arab houses in the West Bank
in an effort to create positive atmosphere ahead of diplomatic
activities to revive the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The order issued by Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai on the
recommendation of the security establishment, covered the Area C
in the West Bank that is under Israel's sole control.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Israel has declared that it would demolish hundreds
of Palestinian homes which it claimed were illegally built in the
Area C. Today's announcement was a step taken by Israel aimed at
easing the rising tension in the territories at a time when the
peace process is deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
The decision was also announced two days ahead of the
scheduled Tuesday summit meeting between Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to
discuss ways of breaking the deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Jewish Communities in the Palestinian
territories denounced the government for making concessions to
the Palestinians. It said the government was signaling to the
Palestinians that it was even willing to relinquish territories
under sole Israeli control.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent attempt to calm the rightist settlers, Israeli
security officials promised that the halt would only be
temporary, and they would continue enforcing the laws to prevent
illegal buildings.
</P>
<P>
The move to halt demolishing Palestinian homes was expected
to have little impact on the whole atmosphere, as the
Palestinian side is demanding a total end to the demolition of
their homes and the expansion of Jewish settlements in their
territories.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Tibi, adviser to Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
President Yasser Arafat, said today that the demolition of
Palestinian homes should cease altogether.
</P>
<P>
He added that the PNA has recently complained to the United
States and the European Union about Israel's demolition of
Palestinian homes in a bid to exert pressure on Israeli
government to stop such acts.

<HEADLINE> Labor Government Forced to Delay Mini-budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the
exchequer, is almost certain to be forced to abandon his hopes of
an early budget, The Sunday Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Chancellor had hoped to complete his budget and deliver it
to the House of Commons on June 10.
</P>
<P>
Brown intended to bring in the 5 billion pounds (8 billion US
dollars) windfall tax on the privatized utilities, begin the
welfare-to-work program and cut VAT on fuel from 8 percent to 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the complications of putting all the tax measures in
place have delayed the time-table. The Sunday Times quoted
Treasury officials as saying "The June 10 date is now very
unlikely."
</P>
<P>
Brown's mini-budget would be later in the month or in July, the
officials added.
</P>
<P>
Senior sources played down suggestions that the delay was due
to problems at the Treasury over Brown's style, and insisted the
plans were still on course and that they had never promised a June
10 budget.
</P>
<P>
Inside the Treasury, however, officials have complained of the
workload forced on them since Brown became chancellor, including
changes in the Bank of England's role, and have warned for some
time that the timetable was a tight one, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that the delay will increase speculation
that the Chancellor plans wider-ranging tax changes than those
indicated in the election run-up.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts believe he will use a National Audit Office
assessment of public finances to introduce a big tax-raising
package.

<HEADLINE> Kurdish Group Calls for Immediate End to Turkish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- A major Iraqi Kurdish opposition
group today called on Turkey to stop its cross-border military
operation in northern Iraq against the Kurdish Workers' Party
(PKK) as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"We hope this operation will be concluded as soon as possible
and Turkish troops will withdraw," a high-ranking Kurdistan
Democratic Party (KDP) official said.
</P>
<P>
Safeen Dizayee, the KDP representative in Ankara, said that
those inhabitants, who were forced to flee the armed clashes,
have rights to return their home.
</P>
<P>
He said that the PKK militants had been thrown out of their
camps in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Kurd groups, including the KDP, have gained control in
northern Iraq since 1991, but PKK rebels then entered the area for
establishing their own bases.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports said that at least 1,750 PKK rebels had
been killed since the 30,000-strong Turkish government troops
waged a massive cross-border battle against the outlawed PKK on
May 16 following a call for aid by KDP chairman Mesud Barzani.
</P>
<P>
KDP, which has control over the areas near the Turkish border,
has aided the Turkish troops during the later's operation.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's large-scale cross-border operation has drawn strong
criticism from both Western and Arab countries, which demand an
early withdrawal of Turkish troops from northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Senior Turkish military sources, however, told the press that
the Turkish government troops will not pull out of northern
Iraq until the region is swept free of the PKK members.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a 13-year-old war to struggle for an
independent Kurdish state in eastern and southeastern Turkey, and
more than 23,000 people have been killed in the armed
clashes.

<P>
MANILA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- At least 15 people were killed and
dozens of others were reported missing today due to heavy flooding
caused by continuos heavy rains in the northern and central
Philippines, national disaster officials said.
</P>
<P>
But a local television reported a higher death toll in its
evening news broadcast, saying at least 22 persons lost their
lives in flood-related accidents.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, President Fidel Ramos ordered the country's
disaster control agencies to mobilize all resources to rescue
thousands of families endangered by mud flows in central Luzon.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the National Disaster Coordinating Council (NDCC)
said that national police force and other anti-disaster forces
have been rushed to the disaster areas covering at least five
provinces.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Health Secretary Carmencita Reodica ordered health
workers in disaster areas to stand by for any emergency caused by
the floods.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Airlines canceled all domestic and international
flights until midnight today due to zero visibility and power
outage at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila.
</P>
<P>
The operation of government offices was also suspended for one
day today under a presidential decree because of an interruption
in public transport caused by the floods.
</P>
<P>
Metro Manila, or the capital region, was listed as the
worst-hit area where 13 people were killed and 9 others injured.
Some 22,000 people in the area were forced to evacuate to safe
grounds due to roof-top waters.
</P>
<P>
Local television reports said about 45 percent of Metro Manila
has been waist-deep or knee-deep under water today. Electricity
went off and on in many parts of the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of commuters, mostly government workers, were
stranded in various parts of Metro Manila, and many vehicles were
trapped in the middle of flooded streets.
</P>
<P>
Other hard-hit areas included the provinces of Zambales, Bataan
and Pampanga located around Mt. Pinatub in central Luzon Island.
</P>
<P>
In Zambales province, two people were reported dead, two
bridges collapsed and over 57,000 US dollars worth of damages in
infrastructure were caused by the floods.
</P>
<P>
National disaster officials said nearly 10,000 families in the
three provinces were threatened by mud flows from Mt. Pinatub and
several shelter centers are being established to accommodate them.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rains have loosened tons of volcanic ash on the slopes of
Mt. Pinatub and rivers full of volcanic ash might breach its banks
anytime, they said.
</P>
<P>
Mt. Pinatub spewed tons of ash and volcanic debris to its
surrounding areas when it erupted in 1991. The mountain's nearby
areas are prone to flash floods during the rainy season in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Because of mud flows, several major routes in central Luzon
have been closed.
</P>
<P>
In Cebu province in the central Philippines, a motorized boat
capsized Sunday afternoon due to strong winds and big waves,
killing seven people.
</P>
<P>
The heavy rains, which began to lash the country Sunday, were
caused by two low pressure areas which have become typhoon
"Bining", according to the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical,
Astronomical Services.
</P>
<P>
The continuing rains, which signaled the beginning of the rainy
season in the country, will last several days, the weathermen
said. The typhoon is now sweeping toward northern Luzon with a
speed of 45 kilometers per hour.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Renato de Villa, who is also NDCC chief,
warned that the number of casualties could rise as the low
pressure areas turned into a typhoon which is expected to bring
more rains in Luzon.

<HEADLINE> Senior Military Officer Reviews Troops Stationed in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- A senior military officer today
urged the Chinese troops to be garrisoned in Hong Kong to build,
with their deeds, an image of being full of power and civility so
as to justify the trust placed on them by the motherland and the
people.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Zhen, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission,
made the remark during an inspection tour to the People's
Liberation Army troops, which began on May 15 in Shenzhen, in
south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Zhang emphasized it is an important symbol of China's
resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong to
garrison troops there.
</P>
<P>
The troops must always bear in mind their historical
obligation, hold a correct political orientation, maintain the
practice of plain living and hard work, and fulfill their military
duties for Hong Kong by acting on laws and with masterful skills,
Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Jiang Zemin, chairman of the Central
Military Commission, emphasized that on the eve of Hong Kong's
return to the motherland, the troops to be stationed in Hong Kong
should uphold an excellent image.
</P>
<P>
He said that the troops will work under a special condition,
and should embody the style of the Red Army.
</P>
<P>
Zhang also urged the troops to strictly abide by the Basic
Law of the Hong Kong SAR and the Garrison Law on the PLA Troops
stationed in the Hong Kong SAR.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 26 (Xinhua) -- After consolidating their
position in northern Afghanistan, the Islamic militia Taliban have
started disarming the local inhabitants, Afghan sources said
today.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 are being airlifted from Jalalabad, capital of
eastern Nangerhar province, to Mazar-e-Sharif, the newly captured
headquarters of defeated Uzbek warlord Rashid Dostum, who has fled
to Turkey, Afghan sources in Peshawar said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban have also started repairing a damaged bridge on the
strategic Salang highway, blown up by the forces loyal to Dostum
in order to check the militia's advancement from Kabul, they said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the forces of Ahmad Masood, former military
chief of the ousted Burhanuddin Rabbani government, have held up
the Taliban's overnight offensive along the Salang highway towards
the Panjsher valley, Masood's stronghold.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban fighters were trying to take position on mountains
overlooking the highway, the main road linking Kabul and northern

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou Seeks Closer Cooperation with Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 26 (Xinhua) -- South China's booming city
Guangzhou is seeking closer ties with Hong Kong as indicated in a
seminar held here today.
</P>
<P>
"Guangzhou's economic, social and cultural exchanges with Hong
Kong are unlike those of other Chinese cities because the two
enjoy a geographical proximity," Guangzhou's Vice-Mayor Chen
Kaizhi said at the first seminar on Guangzhou-Hong Kong
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
It is important for Guangzhou to seek new forms of two-way
cooperation in the days before Hong Kong's handover, Chen said at
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We should expand the high-tech manufacturing industry by
taking advantage of Hong Kong's industrial adjustment," he said.
</P>
<P>
The city will create a sound environment for the establishment
of a Guangzhou-Hong Kong hi-tech industrial zone which will enjoy
favorable policies, such as ensuring the smooth process of
people's entrance and exit from the area, providing more domestic
markets for the manufactured goods, reducing or exempting taxes on
hi-tech industrial equipment and carrying out some polices enjoyed
by bonded zones in the zone, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The zone will take measures to attract personnel, capital and
projects from both Hong Kong and inland areas of China so as to
increase the competitiveness of Guangzhou- and Hong Kong-made
goods in the international market, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to give Hong Kong's role as an international
financial center a full play and to attract more capital
for Guangzhou's economic construction," he said.
</P>
<P>
As a city which spearheads the development of the Pearl River
Delta, Guangzhou by the year 2005 will need more than 470
billion yuan (about 56.6 billion US dollars) of investment in
fixed assets, 40 percent of which will be covered by overseas
investment.
</P>
<P>
In order to expand imports, Guangzhou should enhance ties with
media organizations in Hong Kong, which has both experience and
customers, Chen said.

of the preparatory phase, is scheduled to be operational in the
second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Qarhan Salt Lake is China's largest sylvite production
base. Its potassium chloride deposits account for 98 percent of
the country's total. Qinghai Potash Fertilizer Plant, located in
the lake, is now China's largest potash fertilizer venture with an
annual capacity of one million tons.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iran Closely Monitors Events in Afghanistan: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Iran is closely monitoring events
in Afghanistan and only a broad-based government in Kabul is the
solution to the ongoing conflict in that country, a high-ranking
government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Alaeddein Boroujerdi, Deputy Foreign Minister for Asia-Pacific
Affairs, expressed great concern over the latest development in
war-torn northern Afghanistan -- the fall of Mazar-i-Sharif to
the Taliban Saturday. Now 90 percent of Afghan territory is
under Taliban control.
</P>
<P>
The deputy foreign minister said that alienation of different
ethnic groups in that country will only alter the features of
the crisis and not resolve it.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Iran's stance on the situation in the
neighboring country. He said that "we have made it known that any
developments inside that country is its internal affair."
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he added, Iran will continue its declared
policy of helping achieve peace in Afghanistan and forge
understanding between all warring factions.
</P>
<P>
With respect to humanitarian aid to Afghanistan, he noted,
assistance to innocent Afghans will continue as before. Iran
will not change its policy in this regard.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani said
Iran's policy was based on non-intervention in the internal
affairs of other countries, and he ruled out any military
solution to the Afghan crisis.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether Iran still considered Burhaneddin Rabbani's
government as legitimate, especially in view of the fall of
Mazar-i Sharif, Rafsanjani said, "we always pursued the policy of
recognizing the government officially recognized by the United
Nations. So far the former government of Afghanistan was
considered official by the world body. We are waiting for future
events."

</P>
<P>
The elections, to be held on June 29, stemmed from an accord

<HEADLINE> Cypriot, Greek, Turkish Businessmen Meet in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Businessmen from all the key sides
involved in the Cyprus issue have had a notable and successful
meeting to discuss what they could do to help solve the issue,
Cyprus Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
Business people from both the rival Greek and Turkish
communities in Cyprus, Greece and Turkey met in Istanbul on
Sunday, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
They realized that the settlement of the Cyprus problem would
create political stability and security in the country and give the
local economy a boost, Alecos Michaelides, former Foreign Minister
of Cyprus, who attended the meeting, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The discussion ascertained that a solution to the Cyprus
problem would improve Greco-Turkish relations, he added.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed the regional issues concerning the Balkan
the Middle East as well as cooperation among them, he said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting set up a four-member committee, consisting one
representative for each participating party to prepare the ground
for a bigger business gathering in Athens in October.
</P>
<P>
"This was the first time we had a chance to have an extensive
dialog with Turkish businessmen, which is a very useful
development," Michaelides said.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the meeting took place amid the
improvement of relations between Greece and Turkey, and only
weeks before a U.N.-proposed direct talks between leaders of the
two communities on the island.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem, with which Turkey and Greece have been at
odds, has remained unsolved since 1974 when the island became
divided after Turkish troops invaded and took control of the
northern third of the island in the wake of an Athens-backed coup.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Ready for Liberian Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The west African peace-keeping force
in Liberia known as ECOMOG is totally ready for the coming
elections in that country, Commander Major-general Victor Malu
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press forum, Malu said with the recent arrival of
additional troops from Ghana, Mali and four other countries, the
ECOMOG now boasts a total force of 10,954 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
These troops, he said, have been deployed to over 50 locations
in all the 13 counties across Liberia, including all the county
capitals and most of the border posts.
</P>
<P>
In implementing the revised Abuja peace accord, the force
commander said his troops have disarmed over 30,000 faction
fighters and recovered 28,294 pieces of various weapons.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of the forced disarmament early February, the
ECOMOG has recovered over 4,000 pieces of weapons buried by
former factions in various parts of Liberia, he said.
</P>
<P>
With the security situation continues improving, Malu said
Liberian refugees in neighboring countries like Guinea, Cote
d'Ivoire, Sierra Leone and Ghana have started returning in good
numbers.
</P>
<P>
Statistics shows that in the first three weeks of May,
about 2,000 refugees returned home through 11 border posts under
ECOMOG control.
</P>
<P>
Those internally displaced have also been returning to their
villages, especially from Monrovia, Malu said, adding that many
villages in the hinterland that were desolate when ECOMOG were
first deployed in February and March are now bubbling back to
life.
</P>
<P>
According him, commercial vehicles have already begun plying
the roads from Monrovia to Abidjan, Accra, Conakry and Freetown.
</P>
<P>
As to the shift of the Liberian elections from May 30 to July
19, Malu said it is necessary due to the restructuring of the
Electoral Commission to ensure its independence and
representation of all the parties.
</P>
<P>
He, however, regretted that despite ECOMOG's repeated
assurance of adequate security in the entire country and its
offer to escort politicians on their campaign tours, Liberia's
political parties have not made any serious efforts to go outside
Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
"Of the 16 registered parties, only two have established
offices outside Monvoria," he said.
</P>
<P>
The force commander assured that ECOMOG has all the necessary
means to deploy soldiers at all the polling stations and to
distribute and lift the polling materials.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that with the use of helicopters, ECOMOG can lift
all the polls to Monrovia within two hours after the completion
of the voting.
</P>
<P>
"The ECOMOG is well posed to ensure that the election is not
only free and fair, but is completely devoid of fraud," Malu
concluded.

<P>
ATHENS, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Turkey did not question any state's
sovereignty nor the status of any island which had been given to
Greece under the terms of any treaty, said Turkish Foreign
Undersecretary Onur Oymen.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a conference on Greek-Turkish relations that began
here today, Oymen said that with regard to islands where there
were no relevant agreements, the two countries should hold a
discussion in which each side would submit its documents.
</P>
<P>
He spoke in favor of bilateral contacts to resolve differences,
noting that Athens' invocation of international law, particularly
the U.N. charter, called for peaceful resolution of differences
and for dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Oymen, who arrived here on Sunday, said he had examined with
Greek officials the ways to foster closer relations between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that these would be acceptable to the two governments,
saying that "it is time to turn over a new leaf and to put aside
our differences even just for the time being."
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that the work of the experts' committee formed
recently to examine bilateral problems would also create "a
positive climate" for Cyprus, which he said could not join
international organizations without the agreement of Ankara and
Athens.
</P>
<P>
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel said Friday in an interview
with Greece's Antenna TV channel that his country would be
interested in signing a "non-aggression pact" with Greece, but at
the same time did not withdraw the "threat of war" if Athens
doubled its territorial waters to 12 miles.
</P>
<P>
He also claimed that the sovereignty of about 130 islets and
rocks in the Aegean was questionable.
</P>
<P>
His remarks have caused reactions from the Greek side which
said that such a pact was "meaningless" as long as the "threat of
war" remained, the status quo in the sea was clearly set by
international treaties and the only possible topic for discussion
with Ankara was the status of the continental shelf.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets Iranian Petroleum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua)-- Chinese Premier Li Peng said here
today that prospects are good for cooperation in the petroleum
industry between China and Iran.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng made the remarks at a meeting with visiting Iranian
Minister of Petroleum Gholamreza Aghazadeh at Zhongnanhai, the
headquarters of the central government.
</P>
<P>
Li spoke highly of the agreement between Iran and the China
National Petroleum Corporation for the prospecting and
exploitation of oil and gas and the trade of petroleum
products. The conclusion of the agreement, Li Peng said, marks new
progress of trade and economic relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Along with China's modernization drive comes the need for more
oil and gas. Therefore, China, while further developing its own
petroleum resources, has carried out extensive international
cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. Li said
he believes in a good prospect for such cooperation between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
After years of effort, China has applied advanced technology in
its petroleum industry and manufactured up-to-date equipment in
the field, Li said, adding that this lays a strong foundation for
further cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Aghazadeh expressed the belief that Iranian-Chinese cooperation
in the petroleum industry is off to a good start. Iran has rich
petroleum resources and China has experience and advanced
equipment in oil prospecting and development, hence the two
countries have plenty of reason to engage in long-term cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He noted that his ministry has invited a delegation of
specialists from China to visit Iran to conduct talks on specific
cooperation measures.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Yongkang, general manager of the China National Petroleum
Corporation was present at the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Singapore President Spells out Gov't Priorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Singapore President Ong Teng
Cheong spelt out the Singapore government's priorities for its new
term at the first session of the Ninth Parliament, which opened
here today, almost six months after the country's general
elections in early January.
</P>
<P>
As the People's Action Party (PAP) Government set out its
Singapore 21 program before the last general elections to "make
Singapore our best home", "We must now work together to create an
outstanding living environment for our families", President Ong
said.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore 21 Program is the government's blue print for the
development of Singapore in the 21 century.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will upgrade the country's physical
environment, and build Singapore into a city of excellence, which
includes expanding and improving the public transport system. "No
part of Singapore should be left behind as we progress," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Another priority, as the President said, is to "foster a
gracious society". "To make Singapore a pleasant place to live, it
is not enough just to have handsome buildings and efficient
transportation. Singaporeans must be courteous to one another,
considerate of one another's needs, and well adapted to living
conditions in our dense city," he said.
</P>
<P>
President Ong also said that the government will "invest
heavily in education", with an aim not just to improve a few
schools, but to raise the quality of education across the board.
</P>
<P>
In addition, noting that the number of senior citizens is
growing rapidly in the country, Ong said Singapore must anticipate
the problems of an aging population, and tackle them early while
they are still tractable.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from heavy flooding
has risen to 15 in the northern and central Philippines while
dozens of others have been missing, national disaster officials
said today.
</P>
<P>
In the capital area, or Metro Manila, 13 people were killed and
9 others injured in flood-related accidents while hundreds of
families were forced to evacuate due to deep waters.
</P>
<P>
Initial reports from the National Disaster Coordinating Council
said most of the fatalities in Metro Manila were caused by
collapsing walls loosened by flood waters.
</P>
<P>
Continuous heavy rains in Zambales province also rendered two
people dead, two bridges impassable and over 57,000 US dollar
worth of damages in infrastructure, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, navy frogmen this evening began a search for two
women who fell into a massive manhole in Manila this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The heavy rains, which have continued for four days, were
caused by two low pressure areas which have become typhoon
"Bining", according to the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical,
Astronomical Services.
</P>
<P>
The continuing rains, a sign of the beginning of the rainy
season, will last for several days, the weathermen said.

<HEADLINE> S. Leonean Coup Arouses International Concern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The coup by rebellious soldiers
that toppled Sierra Leone's civilian president Ahmed Tejan Kabbah
on Sunday has come under strong condemnation of the international
community.
</P>
<P>
A United Nations statement said that UN Secretary-general Kofi
Annan was distressed to learn that there had been a coup against
the "duly elected government of Sierra Leone".
</P>
<P>
Annan condemned the coup at a time "especially when the United
Nations is engaged in the efforts to consolidate the peace
process in the country," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
In his immediate reaction to the coup, Secretary-general Chief
Emeka Anyaoku of the Commonwealth said the 52-nation organization
regards such an unconstitutional change of government as " totally
unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
What Sierra Leone needed is "time to recover from its
unacceptable past. This coup coming at this time is indeed a very
retrogressive step," Emeka Anyaoku said, quoted by reports here today.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the reports said, the head of the largest
opposition party in Sierra Leone's parliament, John Karefe-Smart
also expressed surprise.
</P>
<P>
Considering the difficulties inherited by the new civilian
administration, he said, it is unfair to say politicians have
failed as some people are already insinuating.
</P>
<P>
But an unconfirmed report said that the former leader of the
Revolutionary United Front, the main rebel group which signed an
agreement with Kabbah's administration six months ago to bring an
end to the civil war, was not surprised at the development in
Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that rebellious soldiers led by Maj. Johnny
Paul Koroma have overthrown Kabbah's government, dissolved the
parliament, suspended the constitution and imposed a dust-to-dawn
curfew in the country.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the coup plotters Corporal Gborie said on the
state radio hours after gunfire rocked the capital that "we tried
for democracy but the democracy that came to our country is not
real democracy."
</P>
<P>
Gborie also warned foreign troops stationed in the country
with a population of three and a half million not to interfere in
what he called "purely internal matter".
</P>
<P>
Nigerian troops had guarded the residence of president Kabbah
who is said to have fled to Conakry, capital of Guinea. Guinean
troops are also stationed in Freetown as part of the west African
peacekeeping force.

PARIS, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov
scored a straight-set first round win on Monday over Martin Damm
of Czech Republic at the French Open.
</P>
<P>
Kafelnikov defeated Damm 6-2, 6-4, 6-4 to mark the first
victory he had at a Grand Slam tournament since his French Open
victory last year.
</P>
<P>
16-year-old Venus Williams of the United States began her grand
slam event with a close win over Japan's Naoko Sawamatsu 6-2, 6-7
(2-7), 7-5 in a match that lasted tow hours 37 minutes.
</P>
<P>
In the hard-fought third set, the unseeded Williams was down a
break at 3-1. She broke back for 3-2 then broke again at 5-4. She
double faulted twice while trying to serve out the match, allowing
Sawamatsu to even it at 5-5.
</P>
<P>
In other first round action, fifth-seeded American Lindsay
Davenport defeated South African Joannette Kruger 6-2,
6-3. Unseeded Chanda Rubin beat Argetina's Marinana Diaz-Oliva 7-6

<P>
JAKARTA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The police in Banjarmasin,
provincial capital of South Kalimantan, Indonesia, has held 106 of
the 211 people questioned over last Friday's riot which killed 136
people and damaged 157 buildings and 97 vehicles, reports reaching
here today said.
</P>
<P>
"There is no indication however that the riot was an act of
subversion," Lt. Col. Kusbini Imbar, an official of the
information bureau of the South Kalimantan police, said today.
</P>
<P>
"Of the 106 men held, 105 are from Banjarmasin and only one is
from Tabalong district," he said, adding that most of them are in
their late 20s and only one is 17 years old.
</P>
<P>
"We are doing our best to get information from them," he said,
adding that his office has been receiving inquiries on the
whereabouts of the missing people.
</P>
<P>
The riot began Friday afternoon when the ruling party Golkar
supporters, staging their final round of campaigns, were attacked
by supporters of the United Development Party (PPP). The riot
continued into the night.
</P>
<P>
police said 118 people had been admitted to hospitals, many
with serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's three political parties -- the PPP, Golkar and the
Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI)-- started their election
campaign on April 27 for the general election on May 29.
</P>
<P>
During the campaign, which ended on May 23, all the three
contestants have violated the campaign rules by showing strength
in the streets, such as motor parades and marches.
</P>
<P>
The death toll during the 27-day campaign reached 269, and most
of them were killed in campaign-related traffic accidents, police
said.
</P>
<P>
About 124 million voters are eligible to take part in the
forthcoming general election, the sixth one since 1971. The three
parties will vie for 425 seats of the 500 parliament seats, and
the remaining 75 seats are reserved for the armed forces who do

lagos, may 26 (xinhua) -- A senior Nigerian military officer
said here today he did not know whether the Nigerian troops in

<P>
While stressing that "Turkey attaches great importance to the
independence, security and territorial unity of Iraq", Akbel
reiterated that the Turkish cross-border military operation in
northern Iraq was aimed at getting rid of "the PKK terrorist
activities" in the region.
</P>
<P>
"That's the reason why we fail to understand why Iran is
concerned with the Turkish operation in northern Iraq," he said,
adding that Iran "should concern for the PKK activities in the
region."
</P>
<P>
More than 50,000 strong Turkish government troops launched a
cross-border military operation on May 16 in pursuit of the
outlawed PKK rebels in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports said that at least 1,750 PKK militants
were killed in the massive Turkish military operation following
a call for aid by Mesud Barzani, leader of the Kurdistan
Democratic Party (KDP) in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's military operation in northern Iraq has drawn strong
criticism from both Western and Arab countries, which demand an
early withdrawal of Turkish troops from the region.
</P>
<P>
Senior Turkish army sources, however, said that the
large-scale military operation would continue until the northern
Iraq was swept free of the PKK militants.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a 13-year-old separatist war which
has claimed over 23,000 lives in eastern and southeastern Turkey
since August 1984. The Turkish government termed it a serious
threat to Turkey's border security.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian President Meets Syrian PM in Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met
here this afternoon with Syrian Prime Minister Mahmoud Zouebi,
and discussed bilateral relations and the latest developments of
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Following his meeting with Mubarak, the Syrian prime minister
told reporters that he and the Egyptian leader stressed during the
meeting the importance of reactivating joint Arab action and
improving the operation of the Joint Syrian-Egyptian Higher
Committee.
</P>
<P>
He added that the two sides reviewed what has been accomplished
in the work of the the committee, as well as what could be
completed in the current session.
</P>
<P>
"We are seeking to promote economic cooperation between Syria
and Egypt so as to become an example to be followed in joint
Arab action," Zouebi said.
</P>
<P>
Zouebi pointed out that he and Mubarak also discussed some
issues of common concern, with the aim to counter all the
challenges that the Arab nation is confronted with.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the current Syrian-Iraqi rapprochement is
the outcome of fears due to the military cooperation between
Turkey and Israel, Zouebi said: "We Syrians have always stood by
the Iraqi people. We, like all Arab states, stand against any
violation of the sovereignty of an Arab state."
</P>
<P>
Answering the question whether there are new ideas intended to
push forward Syrian-Israeli peace negotiations, the prime
minister said that "those who listen to statements made by the
Israelis will make certain that there is nothing new about the
peace process yet."
</P>
<P>
Syria's talks with Israel collapsed in February last year
primarily because of sharp differences over the fate of the Golan
Heights, captured by the Jewish state from Syria in the 1967
Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
Syria wants the entire Golan back as part of any peace
agreement, but Israel wants to keep at least part of the
strategic plateau for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
Zouebi arrived here earlier today to attend meetings of the 9th
session of the Joint Syrian-Egyptian Higher Committee.

HONG KONG, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Hang Seng Index (HSI), a key
indicator for blue chips on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, today
rose 242.96 points to close 14,574.64, a new record for the index.
</P>
<P>
It is the ninth trading day for HSI to stay at the level above
14,000 points and during the nine days, HSI fell three times by
135 points, but jumped six times by 802 points.
</P>
<P>
The four major HSI sub-indices rose today with finance up
227.82 points to 17,075.96, utilities rising 201.97 points to
11,729.84, properties soaring 570.19 points to 26,348.51, and the
commercials and industrials rising 143.55 points to 9,831.96.
</P>
<P>
Today's turnover on the Hong Kong stock market closed at 20.587
billion HK dollars (2.66 billion US dollars), the highest for the
market in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Stock analysts said that the major factors for the consecutive
upward trend on the local bourse are stable interest rate and the
U.S. renewing most favored nation status to China.
</P>
<P>
They said that the recovery of the local property market in May
constitutes a favorable factor for the rise of the HSI on the
stock market.
</P>
<P>
But, they noted, the most influential factor is the good
forecast for the performances of the China-funded enterprises,
which have lured more and more funds from local people and
overseas firms.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Mortgage Lending Rises Sharply in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's gross new loans in
April increased by 35.2 percent to a record high of 22.7 billion
HK dollars (2.93 billion US dollars), compared with a drop of 10.6
percent in March, according to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority
(HKMA).
</P>
<P>
The amount of outstanding mortgage loans also rose rapidly by
2.4 percent in April, compared with a 1.6 percent increase in
March.
</P>
<P>
The average growth of outstanding loans in the three months to
April decreased to 29.4 percent from 30.1 percent in the three
months to March. But the average change over the last 12 months
increased from 22.0 percent to 23.1 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
New loans approved during the month also rose sharply by 36.4
percent to 28.8 billion HK dollars (3.72 billion US dollars),
reflecting the large scale of market activity in March.
</P>
<P>
"The rapid growth of new mortgage lending in April was a result
of the active property market in March. Market activity slowed in
April. However, loan growth seems to continue at a rapid pace in
May because of the amount of undrawn loan commitments still in the
pipeline," said David Carse, deputy chief executive of the HKMA.
</P>
<P>
He said that the current growth of mortgage lending is
historically high and this is resulting in an increase in banks'
property exposure.

<P>
The spokesman of the new Armed Forces Revolutionary Council,
Johnny Paul Koromah, said that the armed forces had to overthrow
the government of president Ahmed Tejan Kabbah in the coup on
Sunday because of the "cabals and sectional politics" of the
regime.
</P>
<P>
He called for the release of Foday Sankoh, leader of the rebel
Revolutionary United Front, now held in Nigeria, and called on
him to join the new government.
</P>
<P>
He said that Kabbah's government had failed to consolidate
peace and the politicall situation in the country had encouraged
tribal conflict.
</P>
<P>
"At this moment, attempts are being made to work out
modalities for the RUF to join us in order to ensure the peace
that has eluded us for so long," Koromah said.
</P>
<P>
The new leader also warned against foreign intervention in
Sierra leone's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers on Sunday seized power in Sierra Leone from the
government of President Kabbah who reportedly fled to neighboring
Guinea.
</P>
<P>
The capital of Freetown spent the night under a curfew imposed
after widespread looting of Lebanese-owned business,
private homes and United Nations offices and residences.
</P>
<P>
State radio announced late on Sunday that the country's land
borders and air and sea ports were closed until further notice.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Foreign direct investment in Germany

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Close At Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Australian share market shot
to a record closing high today, with positive sentiment after last
Friday's cut in official interest rates.
</P>
<P>
"Our view is that we think the market will continue to rise,"
Wilson HTM analyst Joseph Pagliaro said.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously the major influence on the market was the continuing
factor of the surprise cut in interest rates last week."
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries finished at its high for the day of 2584.8,
up 20.9 points. It eclipsed the previous closing high of 2563.9
set on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Pagliaro said that although brokers would continue to monitor
the Dow Jones' rises in New York, the main reason the cyclical
stocks - retail and building - and the banking and insurance
sector overall were all performing well was the Reserve Bank of
Australia's surprise announcement of a 0.5 percentage point
reduction in official interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Among bank stocks, the National Australia Bank finished at
18.928 Australian dollars, a rise of 13.8 cents. The ANZ, due to
release its half year results this week, surged 21.5 cents to
close at 8.53 Australian dollars while Westpac gained one cent to
7.20 Australian dollars. The Commonwealth Bank of Australia was
steady on 14.13 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index finished 2.5 points higher at 1496.2,
while the all industrials closed 42.5 points better at 4007.2.
</P>
<P>
In the resources sector, BHP Co. Ltd dropped 40 cents to 18.92
Australian dollars after the company announced its fourth quarter
result would be adversely affected by one-off profit adjustments
and its trading conditions remained difficult.
</P>
<P>
It reached a low of 18.75 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Mining giant CRA closed at 21.915 Australian dollars, 26.5
cents higher and WMC Ltd was up 20 cents at 8.48 Australian
dollars. Petsec Energy Ltd, which reported in April that it could
double its 1997 production results, rose 25 cents to 6.45
Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The gold index closed 5.9 points higher at 1542.0.
</P>
<P>
National turner was 334.5 million shares, valued at 747.88
Australian dollars (575.86 million US dollars) with rises
outweighing falls 641 to 468.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Stop Recruiting Foreign Nurses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will no longer
recruit foreign nurses as the country now produces an increasing
number of trained nurses, Health Minister Chua Jui Meng said
today.
</P>
<P>
At present, 319 foreign nurses are currently working in the
country and they are expected to leave when their contracts expire
in three years, the minister said in the northern state of Kedah,
according to the Malaysian national news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
He said nurses training colleges in the country are now able to
produce a total of 3,000 nurses a year compared to only 800 in
1994.
</P>
<P>
"With such numbers, the shortage of nurses in government
hospitals have been overcome," Chua was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia began recruiting foreign nurses from Myanmar, India,
Pakistan, and Sri Lanka on a three-year contract basis in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Chua also said that since his ministry introduced the caring
nurses course in 1995, there had been fewer complaints from the
public about unsatisfactory attitude of nurses and assistant
nurses while on duty.
</P>
<P>
A total of 12,576 nurses and 9,459 assistant nurses in the
country have attended the course so far, according to the
minister.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Orders Operations Against Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today ordered the country's disaster control authorities to
mobilize all resources to rescue thousands of families affected by
floods in the northern and central Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Ramos gave the order during an emergency meeting held in the
northern province of Pampanga, where thousands of families are
endangered by a river with rising mud flows.
</P>
<P>
Ramos today also suspended the operation of all government
offices, except vital function agencies, due to flash floods
caused by heavy rains in Metro Manila and other parts of Luzon
Island.
</P>
<P>
According to acting Executive Secretary Luis Liwanag, who
signed the order for the president, government offices will resume
normal services Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Health Secretary Carmencita Reodica ordered health
workers in disaster areas to stand by for any emergency caused by
the floods.
</P>
<P>
In the provinces of Pampanga, Zambles and Tarlac, tons of
volcano ash on the slopes of Mt. Pinatub are being loosened and
washed into rivers. Nearly 10,000 families in these provinces are
threatened by mud flows and were urged to evacuate to safer
places.
</P>
<P>
Because of mud flows, several major routes in central Luzon
have been closed.
</P>
<P>
In the central province of Bataan, more than 3,000 families
have been forced to abandon their homes due to flash floods,
according to James Sian, disaster management service chief at the
National Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
In the capital region, a total of 11 people have been killed in
flood-related accidents this morning. But there are still no
reports on casualties in other flood-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
Local television reports said about 45 percent of Metro Manila
has been waist-deep or knee-deep under water today. Electricity
went off and on in many parts of the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of commuters, mostly government workers, were
stranded in various parts of Metro Manila, and many vehicles were
trapped in the middle of flooded streets.
</P>
<P>
The heavy rains, which have continued for four days, were
caused by two low pressure areas which have become typhoon
"Bening", according to the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical,
Astronomical Services.
</P>
<P>
The continuing rains, a sign of the beginning of the rainy
season, will last for several days, the weathermen said.

<HEADLINE> 89 Percent of Johannesburg Residents Being South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 26 (Xinhua) -- It is far from reality that
most Johannesburg inner-city residents are poor, unemployed and
occupying overcrowded buildings, according to a survey conducted
by the Inner City Housing Upgrading Trust (ICHUT).
</P>
<P>
The average resident in the area earns more than 2,000 Rands
(455 U.S. dollars) a month, many households have dual incomes and
most flats are occupied by not more than four people, said the
survey.
</P>
<P>
Myths about Johannesburg emerged when the character of the
city changed in the late 1980s after the eradication of the Group
Areas Act, which made it possible for blacks to move into the
city.
</P>
<P>
ICHUT Chairman Gerald Leissner quoted the survey as saying
that 89 percent of the inner city residents are South Africans,
mostly from townships of Gauteng Province and Kwazulu Natal
Province.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that there are about 111,000 people living in
the inner city, 71,000 of whom are in the central business
district.
</P>
<P>
Leissner said most people lived in the city because they
enjoyed the lifestyle and wanted independence from their parents
and extended families.
</P>
<P>
He said although there are pockets of poverty in the city,
about 68 percent of the city's population is formally employed,
eight percent is part-time workers and a further nine percent is
self-employed.
</P>
<P>
But Leissner said, residents are concerned about crimes and
the deteriorating public environment. They complained about
litter, congestion caused by kawkers and taxis, prostitution and
drug dealing.
</P>
<P>
Greater Johannesburg Housing Chairman Lindsay Bremner has
expressed that municipal authorities would make its efforts to
improve services and provide a stable environment.

<HEADLINE> China to Host International Sci-Fi Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- China will host its first
international science fiction conference in Beijing in July, a
spokesman for the China Association of Science and Technology
announced today.
</P>
<P>
The last big one this century, the conference will attract more
than 1,000 writers, publishers, fans and scientists from around
the world.
</P>
<P>
With "Science, Sci-Fi, Peace and Development" as the theme, the
conference is to promote Sci-Fi in China and the rest of the
world. Topics related to economic and social development in the
modern era, like cyberspace, the environment, and space industry
will be be discussed, as will the relationship between Sci-Fi and
modernization.
</P>
<P>
China introduced Sci-Fi from the West early this century as a
means to spread scientific knowledge among the general public. The
country's only Sci-Fi magazine, "Science Fiction World", has
beaten "OMNI" out in having the largest readership in the world,
according to "Locus" magazine.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government supports the development of Sci-Fi,
because it sees it as a way to nourish the scientific spirit of
the nation, according to Song Jian, minister in charge of the
State Science and Technology Commission.
</P>
<P>
However, Chinese Sci-Fi is less developed than that of
developed countries for many reasons, so the government is
planning to further develop the genre to inspire youngsters and
push the modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
The conference has been approved by the State Science and
Technology Commission and will be sponsored by the China
Association for Science and Technology. Astronauts like the
Soviet Union's A.A.Leonov, the first man to walk in space, are
among those expected to attend the gathering, the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Robust Growth Predicted for Philippine Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine economy is expected
to grow by 7 to 8 percent in the next five years while inflation
rate will further drop to 5 to 5.5 percent, the Philippine News
Agency said today.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted Peter Wallace, president of the Economist
Intelligent Unit (EIU) Philippines Inc., as saying that nothing
will disrupt the growth momentum already sustained in the
Philippines for years.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no repeat of boom and bust cycle. Last one in
1986 to 1992 will be the last," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wallace said that the country's rapid export growth of about 20
to 25 percent and broad based investments will primarily spur the
economy's growth while monetary prudence, increased supply of
basic items and competition will keep inflation at manageable
level.
</P>
<P>
The economist played down fears that inadequate infrastructure,
low domestic savings and rising trade deficit could disturb the
momentum as measures are in place to address these problems.
</P>
<P>
The rising trade deficit is offset by earnings from services
while the 17 percent export growth now outpaces the 14 percent
imports, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wallace added that the Philippines is not experiencing the
so-called "property sector bust" due to the projected 2.5 million
backlog in low to middle-income housing by 2000.
</P>
<P>
At worst, he said, there will be glut of only 12 percent of
existing condominiums and offices in 1999.
</P>
<P>
On banks' exposure to the property sector, the economist said
consumer loans are still at "safe levels" and the banks are not
vulnerable as default rate is still less than 5 percent in the
country.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 26 (Xinhua) -- More and more South African
men believe that rape offenders deserve more sever punishment,
according to Research Surveys, South Africa's largest consumer
market research company.
</P>
<P>
The company's latest survey shows 89 percent of white men and
73 percent of black men believe that the punishment for rape is
inadequate.
</P>
<P>
The survey was undertaken in major metropolitan areas
throughout South Africa in February this year.
</P>
<P>
The respective figures for a similar survey in July 1994,
showed that 77 percent of white men and 60 percent of black men
felt the punishment was inadequate.
</P>
<P>
On the question of what type of punishment would be suitable
for a convicted rapist, the death sentence proved to be a more
popular option in 1997, with 54 percent of white men and 33
percent of black men choosing this option.
</P>
<P>
The previous results of the 1994 survey showed that only 35
percent of white men and 20 percent of black men to be in favor
of this option.
</P>
<P>
On whether life imprisonment was a suitable punishment, 17
percent of black men found this to be a suitable form of
punishment in 1994 and this increases to 28 percent in 1997.
However, white men decreased this option from 21 percent in 1994
to 14 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Research Surveys said castration maintained its position as a
fairly low option with 14 percent of white men and eight percent
of black men choosing it as a suitable form of punishment in 1997
compared to 17 percent and nine percent respectively in 1994.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa Launches Pilot Project for Jobless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBUR, May 26 (Xinhua) --The South African government,
business departments and international donors have come out in
support of a new pilot project aimed at harnessing the skills of
the unemployed in a bid to reduce high crime rate and widespread
poverty.
</P>
<P>
The project,known as "Pro-jobs Anticrime", was initiated
yesterday by the Build South Africa, an non-governmental
organissation group, a local daily Business Day reported today.
</P>
<P>
The project will focuse on finding employment,permanent to
temporary for about 250,000 unemployed workers in Alexandra black
township, north of Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
Build South Africa Director Dave Jackson said a number of
business, government departments and religious organisations had
pledged their support for the project, and were currently
considering proposals to convert that support into financial
backing.
</P>
<P>
International donors such as the European Union, the British
government and Japan were also considering financial backing for
the project, the director said.
</P>
<P>
Describing living conditions in Alexandra as "appalling",
Jackson said that 80 percent of crime in northern Johannesburg
emanated from the black township.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, there is an unemployment rate of
between 95 to 98 percent among Alexandra school-leavers,most whom
waited up five years to find employment.
</P>
<P>
Build South Africa is in the process of building a database of
registered unemployed residents as well as conducting surveys
among the 5000 firms and small businesses situated around
Alexandra to establish whether or not they can use the residents'
services permanently.
</P>
<P>
Should it prove to be successful, the project will also be
extended to other areas in South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Weaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed lower
as financial markets came to terms with the implications of last
week's cut in official interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Local currency dealers said the foreign exchange market was
continuing to reassess its expectations for the Australian
dollar's value in the medium term.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Reserve Bank of Australia lowered the overnight
cash rate to 5.5 percent from 6.0 percent, aligning it with US
official rates.
</P>
<P>
The reduction has led to speculation that global investors
would not regard Australian securities as high yielding and
transfer their investments elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar today closed here at 76.55 US cents, down
from 76.79 US cents on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I think what we are seeing is the shock of the rate cut last
Friday," said Bankers Trust foreign exchange dealer Matt Gilmour.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 1.2902 marks, down from 1.2983
at Friday's close and at 88.74 yen from 88.94.

<HEADLINE> Iraq, Italy Seek to Improve Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 26 (Xinhua) -- An Italian parliamentary
delegation is visiting Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi
National Assembly (parliament), aiming at improving relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"This visit is in harmony with a decision taken by the
Italian Senate to call for lifting the U.N.-imposed
sanctions on Iraq and ask the Italian government to release
Iraqi assets frozen in Italy and other European banks," head of
the delegation Alberto Simoni told the Iraqi News Agency
on his arrival Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Last month, a motion to this effect was approved by the Italian
Senate; however, it still needs approval from the lower house. If
passed, it would commit the Italian government to promote a
gradual end to the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The Italian government would also be required to verify
whether the Iraqi assets frozen in Italian banks can be released,
and used to buy food and medicine for the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
In February, Italy, the fourth largest trading partner of Iraq
before the Gulf War in 1991, opened an interests section in the
Iraqi capital Baghdad, six years after their diplomatic ties were
severed.
</P>
<P>
Many Italian businessmen have flocked to Baghdad recently to
secure contracts with local companies under the
U.N. "oil-for-food" deal which allows the sanctions-stricken
state to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil over six months
for badly-needed food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad is now seeking to improve ties with Rome. During his
visit to Rome last month, Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Mohammed Rashid
announced that Iraq was near the signing of an important deal in
Nasiriya oilfield with the Italian oil company Agip.
</P>
<P>
Reshid described the deal as "strategic cooperation" and
expected the production of the oilfield to reach 300,000 barrels
per day.
</P>
<P>
It was reported the deal would be valid for about 23 years and
Agip plans to invest 2 billion U.S. dollars to develop the field.
</P>
<P>
Western analysts here said Iraq, with the world's second
largest oil reserves after Saudi Arabia, attempts to obtain
support by exchange of oil deals to have the seven-year-old
sanctions lifted as soon as possible.

<P>
PARIS, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The ruling rightwing majority suffered a serious setback on
Sunday in the first round of the legislative elections, winning a
score clearly lower than that of the left parties. This allows one
to predict a defeat of the right majority in the second round of the
elections to be held on June 1.
</P>
<P>
-- For the third time in five years, the military of Sierra Leone
knocked the country's president Ahmad Tejan Kabbah from the power on
Sunday, after the latter was restituted to the presidency only 14
months ago. Kabbah, who was elected in the presidential election in
March 1996, was forced into exile in Guinea, while the head of the
coup d'etat, private first class Gborie, imposed a curfew in the
capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The outcome of the first round of legislative elections of
France held on Sunday allows one to foresee a tight fight in the
second round between the left and the ruling majority. Both sides
will see their fate decided by the voters who voted for the smaller
parties in the first round and the intervention by 30 percent of the
voters who abstained from the first round.
</P>
<P>
-- For the extreme-right National Front party, which won 15
percent of the votes in the first round of legislative elections on
Sunday, the result sent a paradoxical message. One the one hand, it
proved it extremely difficult for the party to win a parliamentary
majority, on the other hand it showed that the party has reinforced
its estalishment on the political stage of France.

LONDON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading British newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- In a shock result for France's ruling Center-Right
coalition, the Left surged into the lead in the first round
of parliamentary elections yesterday, reflecting a strong
vote of no confidence in the Government's austerity policies
in the runup to European economic and monetary union.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- British government said yesterday it would not
announce the date of the Budget until after it had published
the results of an independent audit into public finances.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- Labor Party is seeking to bypass the role of civil
servants and bring its propaganda team into the Whitehall
front line in order to sell the new government's message to
the voters.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- The future of the European single currency was thrown
into some confusion last night after a disastrous
performance by the center-right French government in the
first round of parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- England and Wales have a worse crime record than
nearly every other major industrialised nation - including
the US - according to a new international survey obtained by
The Guardian.

<HEADLINE> Qatar Opens Stock Market to Liberalize Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Qatar has for the first time
opened its stock market, confirming a thrust by the country's new
rulers to liberalize the economy.
</P>
<P>
Qatari Minister of Finance, Economy and Trade Sheikh Mohammed
bin Khalifa al Thani today inaugurated an authorized stock
exchange, named the Doha Securities Market which will start
trading officially from Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During a telephone interview with Xinhua today, an official
from the ministry who preferred anonymity said only Qatari
nationals are allowed to trade initially, and at the second phase
-- expected at the end of the year, the bourse will open to
nationals of the Gulf Cooperation Council(GCC) states.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners will "finally" be allowed to trade in the market,
he said, adding the exact date for the permit remains unknown.
</P>
<P>
Three banks, known as Qatar National Bank, Doha Bank Ltd. and
the Commercial Bank of Qatar have been appointed official brokers
while 18 companies have been listed at the bourse with a market
capital of 1.9 billion dollars, he added.
</P>
<P>
Brokers here said that the legitimate market will replace
unofficial stock trading now conducted by unlicensed
stock-brokers via telephone.
</P>
<P>
They believe it will regulate the unofficial market and
encourage new companies to be set up, they said.
</P>
<P>
The open of the stock market is a step to further boost Qatar's
economic liberalization drive, called for by Qatar's Emir Sheikh
Hamad bin Khalifa al Thani after a bloodless palace coup brought
him to power in the gas-rich country in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Qatar has been in the forefront of regional economic
development since the coup and it is making efforts to develop a
modern physical and social infrastructure to attract more
investments of foreign companies.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Reports Negative Growth in Retail Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Retail price index pointed to 99.8
in China's largest metropolis of Shanghai in April, down 1.1
percentage points on a year-on-year basis.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time in 12 years that the industrial and
commercial center has registered negative growth in retail
commodities prices.
</P>
<P>
The drop in retail prices index has been attributed to
declining prices of six major categories of commodities --
household electric appliances, building and decorating materials,
soft drinks, cigarets and alcoholic drinks, machinery and
electronics products, cultural goods, stationery, sports gear, and
jewels.
</P>
<P>
In April, prices of household electric appliances, including
washing machines, micro-wave ovens, air-conditioners and video
recorders, dropped by 13.8 to 29.9 percent.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Central China Adopts Minimum Wage System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Hubei Province in central China has
decided that within two years its minimum income system that is
now in effect in the capital for poor people there, will be
extended to all cities.
</P>
<P>
Wuhan, capital of Hubei Province, introduced the system in
March of last year, to guarantee at least 140 yuan each month for
more than 46,000 residents, by the end of the year. The total
amount paid out was 2.17 million yuan, helping people get past
their difficulties, according to the Provincial Civil Affairs
Department.
</P>
<P>
The province then went on to set other targets and formulate
concrete measures, and decided that the minimum wage would be
available to needy urban dwellers in all cities by the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Different regions are required to set different wage standards
depending on local prices and living conditions. Recipients
include people with disabilities, families with financial
difficulties, disaster-stricken families, those who have been out
of work for more than two years or who have no regular source of
income, and those who need to be taken care of, and other needy
residents.
</P>
<P>
The cost of the system will be included in local government
budgets, and if necessary, the provincial government will provide
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Civil Affairs Minister Doje Cering spoke highly of
Hubei's practice, saying he believes that it will promote the
establishment of a social security system throughout the central
and western parts of China.

<HEADLINE> Ex-PAC President's Appeal Against Expulsion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 26 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's National Executive
Committee (NEC) of Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) has turned down an
appeal against expulsion from former PAC president Clarence Makwetu,
local daily the Star reported today.
</P>
<P>
The NEC ratified last Saturday the ruling of its disciplinary
committee to expel Makwetu, who was accused of fostering factionalism
along ethnic lines.
</P>
<P>
Makwetu did not attend the appeal hearing and failed to send a
formal note informing the NEC of his reasons for appealing against his
expulsion.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Makwetu can still appeal to PAC national
conference which is due to take place later this year.
</P>
<P>
PAC President Stanley Mogoba said there was no fear that
Makwetu's removal would cause a split in the organization because
"he (Makwetu) has already caused a split and he has been encouraging
it".
</P>
<P>
Makwetu, a member of parliament of PAC, is also likely to lose
his seat in parliament as PAC Secretary-General Ngila Muendane has
been chozen to replace Makwetu in the National Assembly, informed
sources said.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Begin implementation of Urban Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government is
scheduled to start in June implementation of an urban road
project to rehabilitate deeply cratered roads in 26 urban areas
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The project will cost about 154.5 million U.S. Dollars, out of
which 114.5 million Dollars is provided by the World Bank and the
rest by the Kenyan government.
</P>
<P>
The weekly paper "The East African" today said that the
project will begin in June after the World Bank approves the
award of supervision contracts to six engineering consultants.
</P>
<P>
The project includes routine maintenance of about 2,000
kilometers of roads, recarpeting of some 400 kilometers paved
streets, and rehabilitation of over 400 kilometers of streets.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the project would also cover provision of
street lighting, construction of missing linkups and making dual
carriageways in major cities like Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Potholed roads in Nairobi and other cities and towns all over
the country have become a major talking point among Kenyans
recently.
</P>
<P>
According to a study, the World Bank said that less than 10
percent of urban roads in the east African country were in good
state.
</P>
<P>
In March this year, Kenyan Local Government Minister Francis
Lotodo launched the Kenya urban transport infrastructure project
in a bid to improve transport management and its efficiency.

<HEADLINE> China Speeding Up Northwest Oil, Gas Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Development of oil and gas resources
on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in the northwestern part of China
will be stepped up, according to Jiang Jiemin, director of the
Qinghai Petroleum Administration.
</P>
<P>
The administration will try to verify 600 million tons of oil
and gas reserves by the end of the century, compared with the
present 200 million tons. Annual output will rise to three million
tons in four years. By 2005, proven reserves and output will
further climb to 800 million and 10 million tons respectively,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The Qinghai Oilfield in Qinghai Province, in the Qaidam Basin
3,000 meters above sea level, is the fourth largest in the
country. Since China started to develop it in 1954, the field has
produced a total of 14 million tons of crude oil and more than 7
million tons of refined oil. It pumped out 1.5 million tons of oil
and gas last year, with 1,000 cubic meters of natural gas counted
as one ton of crude oil.
</P>
<P>
In order to increase reserves, the administration last year
explored the northern part of Tibet, and found promising
oil-bearing structures.
</P>
<P>
In recent years China's oil industry has been pursuing the
strategy of "stabilizing output in the eastern oilfields while
developing the west." The country's oil and gas output goal is 200
million tons by the end of the century. The Qaidam Basin and other
areas in the vast western part of China are expected to play an
increasingly important role in the strategy.
</P>
<P>
The China National Petroleum Corporation recently called
the field's Nanbaxian and Sebei areas important exploration
blocs, officials say.
</P>
<P>
The administration has also had some progress in exploration
work with the US's Exxon and Amoco in a 32,600-sq.m. bloc.

<HEADLINE> Opposition Parties Fight Jordan's New Press Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's opposition parties' deputies
are now trying to muster a necessary absolute majority of 41
signatures to call the 80-member parliament into an extraordinary
session to castigate the government for the introduction of
amendments to the 1993 Press and Publication Law.
</P>
<P>
The amendments are aimed at gagging the press during upcoming
parliamentary elections by imposing severe restrictions on
coverage and to close down a daring weekly newspaper industry,
some deputies said at a press conference Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"As deputies, we studied all options available (to protest the
amendments), including resignation," said Islamic Action Front
(IAF) deputy Mohammad Awaidah. "Our conviction is that we can
serve this issue better while we are still deputies."
</P>
<P>
The number of signatures now collected is "modest," said
Awaidah, while denoting that opposition parties currently hold 23
seats in the 80-member parliament.
</P>
<P>
The amendments were earlier enacted by King Hussein and later
introduced as the third temporary law under the current
government. They were widely believed to target the weekly
tabloids which have been blamed for "slinging mud on the royal
family, leaking military secrets and intruding citizens' privacy."
</P>
<P>
Under the new articles of the law, each violator will face
fines from some 21,186 U.S. dollars to 35,311 dollars, a
substantial hike from those under the former law. And most of
the dozen weekly tabloids will have to close down because they can
not accumulate the demanded capital before the deadline set by in
the amendments.
</P>
<P>
Government officials defended the amendments as "saving
national fabrics" and said that the government would not make any
concession to the press in pushing them through.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as Jordan Times reported today, the government
promised Saturday to raise the allowances for those employees who
are members of professional associations.
</P>
<P>
The allowance increase will cover public sector doctors,
dentists, pharmacists, veterinarians, nurses and engineers, said
Minister of State for Information Affairs Samir Mutawi Saturday
after a regular cabinet session.
</P>
<P>
Nine members of the Jordan Press Association's (JPA) 10-member
council submitted their resignations, one day after the amendments
were approved by the King; but they revoked their decision three
days later under government pressure.
</P>
<P>
JPA also called an 80-people demonstration in front of the prime
minister's office last Tuesday, in which nine people were jailed
and six injured.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, four professional association presidents resigned and
the rest threaten to do so a month later, which meant the
dismantling of the 13-member Council of Presidents of Professional
Association (CPPA) that usually serves as a bridge between the
government and the professional associations.
</P>
<P>
In 1993 after widespread riots demanding for more democracy,
Jordan passed the Press and Publication Law to free up journalists
at state-controlled publications and allow for independent
newspapers, which enjoyed autonomy in publishing modest criticism
of the government.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Jordan to Negotiate Railway Links </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has agreed to begin
negotiations with Israel for the construction of two railway
links, with three international companies expressing interest in
the project, today's Jerusalem Post reported.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Ariel Sharon, Israeli National Infrastructure
Minister, as saying that the talks on joint infrastructure
projects were made possible following the Israeli cabinet's
approval on Friday of the transfer to Jordan of an additional 50
million cubic meters of Jordan River water.
</P>
<P>
The proposed railway lines render the possibility of
Jordanian Dead Sea chemicals being transported by train to the
port of Ashdod, in southwest Israel, for export, rather than
through Jordan's Aqaba port as at present. This will cut the
distance by half.
</P>
<P>
There is also interest in operating a rail service between
Aqaba and Israel's Eilat, as well as one northwards, which
would open up both freight exports and imports and encourage
tourists into the Arava and Dead Sea areas along the
Israeli-Jordanian border.
</P>
<P>
The line connecting the Dead Sea area and Gulf of Eilat
(Aqaba) would straddle the border, so that in times of
crisis both sides would have an interest in keeping it open,
said the report.

<HEADLINE> Iran Protests Turkish Military Incursion into </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Iran has summoned a senior Turkish
diplomat to Tehran to the Foreign Ministry and issued a protest
against the recent Turkish military incursions into northern Iraq,
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The IRNA said Turkish charge d'affaires to Tehran, Aydin
Evirgen, was summoned to the ministry on Sunday evening to hear
the Iranian protest and Tehran's concern over the massive Turkish
military presence in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Rvirgen was also told that the latest
moves of Ankara violated international laws and regulations and
that Iran calls on Turkey to immediately and unconditionally
withdraw its army from the Iraqi territory.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held here Sunday, Iranian President
Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani expressed his concern over the
Turkish-Israeli alliance and Turkish presence in northern Iraq,
both of which he described as "new problems," calling for
"vigilance and caution."
</P>
<P>
"We are in consultation with Arab-Islamic countries on the
issue and trying to prevent such problem from spreading out," he
said at the hour-long press conference.
</P>
<P>
More than 50,000 Turkish forces have recently launched
military incursions into northern Iraq to chase members of the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) since early this
month. Some of them have already fled into the Iranian territory.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati last week voiced
its opposition to the military incursions by the Turkish forces
into northern Iraq, saying that "we oppose the violation of the
borders of the countries by other countries."
</P>
<P>
Velayati said: "We strongly believe that the territorial
integrity of Iraq must be preserved. Whoever violates
territorial integrity must be stopped."

<HEADLINE> 11 Killed in Flood-Related Accidents in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manila, May 26 (Xinhua) -- As heavy rainfall continued for the
fourth day today in the Philippines, some parts of the country
have been seriously flooded and 11 people were killed in
flood-related accidents in the capital of Manila.
</P>
<P>
The torrential rains, spawned by two active low pressure areas
which have become typhoon "Bening," started last Friday and may
continue in the coming days, according to the Philippine
Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services.
</P>
<P>
The four days of heavy rains have caused flooding in most parts
of Manila with water as deep as two or three feet (about a half or
one meter) high in some streets. By this afternoon, the death toll
has risen to 11 in the capital. All the victims were killed in
flood-related accidents, such as collapse of houses caused by
heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
In the capital city, traffic on major roads was interrupted and
some factories were closed as workers failed to go to work today.
</P>
<P>
In some parts of Manila, heavy rains also interrupted supply of
vegetables, which have to be shipped into the city from Baguio,
about 250 kilometers north of Manila.
</P>
<P>
In the provinces of Pampanga and Zambales, heavy rains loosened
tons of volcano ash from the slopes of Mt. Pinatubo and washed it
into rivers. At least 78,725 families in 599 villages in Central
Luzon are threatened by mudflows and were urged to evacuate to
safer and higher grounds if the weather worsens.
</P>
<P>
Mt. Pinatubo spewed tons of ash and volcanic debris into
surrounding areas when it erupted in 1991.
</P>
<P>
In Pampanga, three major highways were closed while the Gugu
Bridge spanning the Olongapo-San Fernado highway was narrowed to
one-lane traffic as three-feet-deep mudflows filled up the
Pasig-Potrero River.

HARARE, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Ambassadors of the member states of
the Organization of African Unity (OAU) meet here today to
discuss a report by the OAU's Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim
for the 33rd OAU summit scheduled for June 2-4.
</P>
<P>
The participants will also deal with membership contributions,
conflicts in Africa, continental economic problems and the
landmine problem.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's Foreign Minister Cde Stan Mudenge said in an
interview that a major item of the meeting is the setting up of
an African Court of Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
He said the envoys will also finalize the agenda of the
meeting of their foreign ministers which will precede the OAU
summit.
</P>
<P>
The ambassadors form a permanent consultative body at the OAU
headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Mudenge said the OAU had grown stronger over the years
confounding its critics who had predicted that the organization
would collapse practically from its inception.
</P>
<P>
"We have shown that we have more that unites us in terms of
history and aspirations than what divides us in terms of imposed
alien languages and the infrastructures geared to make us
appendages of foreign powers rather than be partners in Africa,"
the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said the OAU will go forward with courage and will rise
from its ashes and become more powerful than before.
</P>
<P>
This year's summit hosted by Zimbabwe is the first to take
place in southern Africa since the 1972 Lusaka summit.

CHONGQING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing, China's newest
municipality and the largest industrial and commercial center in
southwest China, has tightened controls over overseas investment
to improve efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The city has published a list of projects that need overseas
investment and has established a data bank dealing with the
introduction of overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
It is encouraging investment in infrastructure, high-tech
projects, export-oriented agricultural projects, developing key
local name-brand commodities, and upgrading aging industrial
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing is located at the juncture of the Yangtze and Jialing
rivers. It has some 8,000 industrial enterprises with state-owned
assets accounting for 70 percent of its total industrial assets,
and more than 400,000 scientists and technicians.
</P>
<P>
The city is now home to 2,095 overseas-backed businesses
involving 4.5 billion US dollars in overseas investment, including
40 or more multinationals. In the past six years, Chongqing has
borrowed about 1.44 billion U.S. dollars in overseas commercial
loans, most of which has been used for energy, transportation,
telecommunications, and municipal public works.
</P>
<P>
The overseas funds have helped improve the quality of goods,
readjust the city's industrial structure and upgrade its major
industries, especially the automobile industry.
</P>
<P>
Local sources say that the machine-building and chemical
industries, key sectors of the city, have had the most overseas
investment.

million U.S. dollars for the machine-building sector, and 72
million U.S. dollars for the chemical industry, accounting for 75
percent and 11.1 percent of the city's actual overseas investment,
respectively.

<HEADLINE> Iran Urges US to Prove Goodwill for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- A major Iranian newspaper urged the
United States to prove its goodwill for rapprochement today, just
three days after the election of a new president.
</P>
<P>
English language daily Tehran Times, in an editorial, asked the
Clinton administration to abandon the hostile policy toward Iran.
</P>
<P>
The editorial said: "We have our own conditions for the
resumption of ties with the United States. With the change of
government in Iran, there should be no change in Iranian foreign
policy principles."
</P>
<P>
"It is the U.S. that must change its attitude towards Iran to
pave the way for the resumption of ties," the daily noted.
</P>
<P>
On the possibility to improve the bilateral relations, the
Tehran Times, a paper with strong background of the Foreign
Ministry, said "Washington must in the first place put an end to
its unjustified hostility against Iran. It must stop its
worldwide plots against the Islamic Republic of Iran, including
economic sanctions and its proclaimed war to overthrow the
Islamic system."
</P>
<P>
It also said the U.S. "must halt its baseless charges"
against Iran and "pursue a rational approach" in its Iran
policy. The White House must also "release our assets to prove
its goodwill," the paper added.
</P>
<P>
The English daily issued the long editorial in response to
a so-called overture by a White House official to Tehran Saturday
after the election of moderate President-elect Seyed
Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted the president-elect as saying Iran is
following the situation carefully and it needs to see if there
will be "actual change in behavior" in issues concerning the
Islamic republic in the past such as "terrorism, proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction, and human rights."
</P>
<P>
The editorial stressed there is the need to exonerate Iran of
the three baseless charges constantly leveled against it by
U.S. officials, "for Washington has till date failed to provide a
single evidence on any one of the above charges."
</P>
<P>
It claimed that it is Tehran, not Washington, that should set
the conditions for rapprochement with the United States.
</P>
<P>
In Iran, the majority of government officials were reported to
have great interest in resuming diplomatic ties between the two
countries, which broke in April 1980 after a hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
However, Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and his hardliner
supporters have assumed a very tough stance toward the United
States, claiming that Iran maintains normal and friendly
relations with all countries in the world, except the U.S. and
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati has claimed that it is
Khamenei who defines Iran's foreign policy no matter who is
elected as the new president. There will be no change in the
foreign policy, he stressed.

The worst cases of hippo poaching occurred in April when about
14 hippos were slaughtered in two weeks, and at least 20 hippos

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Hebei Province in north China
is doing an efficient job in a World Bank-sponsored afforestation
and poverty relief project, a bank group reported after a recent
inspection.
</P>
<P>
The province has planted 55,869 ha of trees in 19 counties over
the past five years, with local farmers earning 314 yuan in per
capita annual income from forestry, and raising the forest
coverage rate by 4.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Afforested areas have added 1.1 million cubic meters of wood
reserves annually, 21 percent more than the Ministry of Forestry's
standards for fast-growing forests, World Bank experts said.
</P>
<P>
As part of the project, farmers drilled more than 2,000 wells
on sandy wasteland and built 560 km of roads to improve farming
conditions. As a result, desert-like wasteland was turned into
fertile farmland, adding 9,000 yuan in income per ha for farmers a
year.
</P>
<P>
China uses World Bank loans for afforestation projects for
helping the needy by improving the eco-system and farming
conditions. The Hebei project, which has a loan of 10 million US
dollars, was part of the program.
</P>
<P>
World Bank experts are interested in the province's success
in sandy wasteland cultivation, combining forests and grain
production, and mixed irrigation for forests and grain growing,
and say that the afforestation methods can be used as an example
for other countries.

SEOUL, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK) and South Korea signed an agreement today on 50,000
tons of aid food for the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
The food aid, labeled as coming from South Korean donors, will
be delivered by the end of July, said Johan Schaar, spokesman for
the International Federation of the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
After days of negotiations, the DPRK agreed to open up more
delivery routes for the aid, while South Korea dropped a demand
that the food be delivered through the heavily guarded zone which
divides the north and south.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations estimated that 4.7 million people in the
DPRK, a fifth of the total population, would face starvation this
summer without massive food aid.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK has suffered from serious food shortages since floods
hit the country's major agricultural regions in 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's Red Cross has provided food in aid for the DPRK
twice during the past two years, reports said.

million of them, will go to the polls on May 29 for the 1997
general election.
</P>
<P>
This is the sixth general election carried out during the new
order administration under the leadership of President Soeharto
after the ones held respectively in 1971, 1977, 1982, 1987 and
1992. Prior to the ascent of the new order, Indonesia had
organized only one general election in 1955.
</P>
<P>
The general election is mainly to elect members of the 500-seat
house of representatives (DPR), who will subsequently form the
people's consultative assembly (MPR) along with 500 appointed
functional and regional representatives.
</P>
<P>
The MPR has the constitutional tasks of electing the president
and vice president, and determining the guidelines of state
policy.
</P>
<P>
There are three contestants in the 1997 general election,
namely the United Development Party (PPP), the ruling party Golkar
and the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI).
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian election system does not advocate direct
election. Voters do not choose candidates but choose the symbols
of the political organizations contesting the polls.
</P>
<P>
The election shall be undertaken on the principles of being:
Direct (every voter should vote direct: he or she is not allowed
to delegate the right to another person): Public (the whole
public, meeting the requirements, are eligible to vote): Free
(everyone is free to determine his or her choice in voting): and
Secret (voters are guaranteed the secrecy of their choice: it must
not be communicated or disclosed to any other person).
</P>
<P>
According to the registration, out of Indonesia's total
population of 196,286,613 persons, there are 124,740,987 eligible
voters, comprising 61,276,313 men and 63,464,674 women.
</P>
<P>
According to a government announcement, there are 2,293
legislative candidates from the three election contestants. Of the
total, PPP appears with 720 candidates, Golkar with 829 and PDI
with 744. Each of the members elected will represent 400,000
people of the Indonesian nation.
</P>
<P>
At the national level, DPR has 500 members. Of the total, 425
are elected through the general election while the remaining 75
will be appointed to represent the armed forces who do not vote in
the election.
</P>
<P>
The number of legislative members at the provincial level (DPRD
i) for the 27 provinces are 1,419, comprising 1,135 members
elected in the general election and 284 members appointed to
represent the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The number of legislative members at the municipality level
(DPRD ii) for the 300 second-level regions in Indonesia are
10,679, comprising 8,547 members elected in the general election
and 2,132 members appointed to represent the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
There are 12 phases in the implementation of the 1997 general
election from registration of voters to the oath-taking or
inauguration of new legislative members.
</P>
<P>
Rounding up the process, MPR will hold a general conference on
March 1 to 11, 1998, to elect the president and vice president,
and to determine the guidelines of state policy for the term
1998-2003.

<HEADLINE> Australian PM Regrets Aboriginals' Sufferings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard today said he was personally sorry for the hurt aboriginal
people suffered under the policy of former governments.
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I feel deep sorrow for those of my fellow
Australians who suffered injustices under the practices of past
generations towards indigenous people," the prime minister told
the national reconciliation convention in Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
The comments drew strong applause from the gathering of almost
2,000 delegates, the Australian Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference is being held to mark the 30th
anniversary of the 1967 referendum, when almost 92 percent of
Australians voted yes to allow the government to give the
indigenous people citizenship.
</P>
<P>
Howard has been under intense pressure to make a formal apology
for the policy under which part-aboriginal children were
systematically taken from their families to state and church
institutions, where they were to be brought up as Europeans and
assimilated into a white Australia.
</P>
<P>
A report of the official Human Rights and Equal Opportunity
Commission said as many as 100,000 aboriginal children were
separated from their families and culture during 1910-1970.
</P>
<P>
The report, to be tabled to parliament this week, concludes
that the policies of forced removal constituted a "crime against
humanity" which amounted to genocide.
</P>
<P>
The commission recommends reparations be extended to affected
families and communities and calls for an apology by all
Australian parliaments and police forces.
</P>
<P>
The federal government moved swiftly to reject the compensation
proposal.
</P>
<P>
During his speech, Howard repeated his belief that Australians
today need not bear the sins of the past.
</P>
<P>
"Australians of this generation shouldn't be required to accept
guilt and blame for past actions and policy over which they had no
control."
</P>
<P>
"We must acknowledge past wrongs, understand that they still
cause a great deal of personal distress and resolve to improve
areas of indigenous disadvantage both now and into the future".
</P>
<P>
The prime minister's defense of his 10 point native title plan
on pastoral leases drew a hostile reaction from the audience,
about 200 aboriginal representatives stood and turned their backs
on him in a traditional act of protest, local radio reports said.
</P>
<P>
The aboriginals demand for retaining their native title on
pastoral leases, while pastoralists have urged the government to
extinguish the native title.
</P>
<P>
John Howard's 10 point plan, which has not yet revealed, seems
to offer compensation to aboriginals in exchange for their
ownership of the pastoral land.

<HEADLINE> Local Elections Held in Central, East Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Voters in this capital city of
Nepal flocked to different polling stations to cast their ballots
in early morning today in order to avoid the scorching sunlight in
the day.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the total seven million eligible voters are
expected to show up for the local polls underway today in Nepal's
central and eastern regions including Kathmandu, election
officials here said.
</P>
<P>
The voters will elect leaderships for 34 municipalities and
over 2,000 villages of 35 districts at about 3,000 polling
stations, they said.
</P>
<P>
The polls are the second phase of the country's local elections
following the first phase in West Nepal's 40 districts held over
one week ago.
</P>
<P>
Nepal has a total of 58 municipalities and less than 4,000
villages in all the 75 districts.
</P>
<P>
Results of the first phase local elections show that major
ruling partner the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist
Leninist, CPN-UML) leads far ahead of other parties including main
opposition the Nepal Congress (NC), which held most of the
country's local administration bodies before the elections.
</P>
<P>
The NC party has accused the CPN-UML of encouraging its workers
to resort to violence and crimes to secure its landslide win
during the first phase elections.
</P>
<P>
But on the eve of the second phase polls, the CPN-UML Sunday
counterattacked the charges, claiming that it was the NC who was
"resorting force to bend the polls in its favor and heaping
charges on other parties".
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML also criticized the Election Commission for its
election management including inadequate security arrangements.

<HEADLINE> Preliminary Results of Referendum Announced in Ecuador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Early returns from a national
referendum today showed a majority of Ecuadoran voters supported
the dismissal of President Abdala Bucaram.
</P>
<P>
According to unofficial statistics, 74 percent of the people
were in favor of the February 6 congressional decision to sack
Bucaram on the ground of his "mental incompetence."
</P>
<P>
Nineteen percent of Ecuadoran voters appeared to be still
behind the 45-year-old president, who was elected for a four-year
term last July but stayed in power for only six months.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 62 percent of voters optioned to back the
congressional election of Fabian Alarcon as the Central American
nation's interim president and 32 percent disagreed.
</P>
<P>
With the results, expected to be made official within 10 days,
Bucaram, of the Ecuadoran Roldosista Party, lost his final hope to
regain the presidency also plagued by corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
On his part, congressional leader Alarcon would work as interim
president until August 10, 1998, when a new elected head of state
will take over following general elections early next year.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador's latest political crisis erupted in February on the
second day of a two-day nationwide strike called by unions to
oppose the government's harsh economic austerity measures.
</P>
<P>
Targeted by the popular protest were, among others, a
200-percent electricity and gas rate hike and a 60-percent rise in
bus fares imposed by Bucaram in early January.
</P>
<P>
The national referendum today was aimed at avoiding suspicion
that the congressional decision to remove a president then did not
accord with the country's Constitution.

PRAGUE, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Graft, bribery, tax evasion and
other types of economic crimes are rampant in the Czech Republic
and have caused heavy losses in the state coffers.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry last year registered more than 200,000
cases of economic crimes nationwide resulting in losses equivalent
to 20 billion korunas (about 667 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
These cases accounted for 62 percent of the total of
crime-related losses in 1996, an official of the ministry was
quoted as saying recently by a press report available here today.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the upsurge of crime wave mainly to the
understaffing and inexperience of law enforcement forces, as well
as administrative inaction in cracking down on economic crimes.

GUANGZHOU, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Over half of its rural areas in
south China's Guangdong province have met China's target of
providing its rural residents with basic health care facilities by
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
By last December, 71 counties and county-level cities and
districts, or 60 percent of the total, passed an appraisal on
their work to ensure that every resident has access to basic
health care facilities.
</P>
<P>
The province has invested some 292 million yuan (about 35.2
million US dollars) in upgrading health care facilities in its
rural areas since the beginning of the 1990s. With new facilities
built and existing ones renovated, over 90 percent of Guangdong's
rural population now have access to basic health care service.
</P>
<P>
In line with the government's putting emphasis on health care
for rural people, the people's own awareness of health care is
also increasing in one of the more developed coastal provinces in
the country.
</P>
<P>
When a farmer is building a new house, he never neglects to
design pipes for tap water and a proper toilet. As a result, 95
percent of the farmers use tap waters. A growing number of local
women go to hospital when they are having a baby instead of
resorting to local midwives.

<HEADLINE> Public Hygiene Facilities Improved in East China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, May 26 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui province has made
great efforts over the past ten-plus years to improve basic public
hygiene facilities.
</P>
<P>
The province made the improvement of public hygiene part of its
drive to build a better investment environment, thus incorporating
it into the overall economic development plan, according to the
provincial committee of patriotic health campaign.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, Anhui has injected about 2.26 billion
yuan (about 272 million US dollars) in building public hygiene
facilities, and other city infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The money has been used to build or renovate 676 public
lavatories with flushing toilets, 111 garbage transferring
stations, and 38 garbage and excrement disposal grounds, as well
as a large number of water and gas supply facilities.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the efforts, city environment has been improved
tremendously across the province. In 1995, Ma'anshan, a
traditional industrial base used to be known for its unpleasant
urban environment, was selected as a National Hygienic City.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the province also invested about 439 million
yuan (about 53 million US dollars) in the project of providing
clean water for rural residents. By the end of the last year, 89.1
percent of the local population had access to clean water, and
13.4 percent used tap water.

<HEADLINE> General Motors to Invest in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The United States' auto giant
General Motors (GM), one of the world's largest car assemblers,
has planned to put up a 7 billion pesos (266 million US dollars)
automotive assembly complex in the Philippines, the local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Citing documents from the Board of Investments, the reports
said that GM top executives had discussed in detail their proposed
investments in the Philippines early this year.
</P>
<P>
The GM project involves the construction of a 1.8 billion pesos
(68 million dollars) export-oriented transmission plant and a 400
million pesos (15.2 million dollars) auto assembly plant, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
The transmission plant will have a production capacity of
100,000 units a year and is expected to be operational by 2000.
The assembly plant will manufacture medium-sized cars, the Corsa
and Tigra models.
</P>
<P>
If approved by the government, this project will be the first
by GM in the country after the car giant chose Thailand to be its
major production hub in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines lost its bid to Thailand in the middle of last
year because of the latter's big domestic market, infrastructure
and other support facilities. But GM promised to still invest in
the Philippines in a variety of automotive-related projects.

<HEADLINE> Thai Banks Agree to Cut Lending Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's commercial banks have
agreed to cut the minimum lending rate by one percentage point
over four months to help reduce export costs and increase the
competitiveness of Thai products.
</P>
<P>
The lending interest rate cut, agreed upon on Sunday at an
"export summit" being held in Pattaya with 31 selected Thai
leading exporters, bankers and industrialists, and is chaired by
Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, is aimed at helping revive
Thailand's economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
The minimum lending rate will be reduced by an average of 0.25
percentage points each month, starting this month, according to
Olarn Chaipravat, chairman of the Thai Bankers' Association.
</P>
<P>
To date, the Finance Ministry and the Bank of Thailand have
stuck to a policy of maintaining high interest rates, to defend
the currency against speculation, but this has hurt private
investment.
</P>
<P>
Olarn said the commercial banks would not wait for the central
bank to cut the official discount rate, the rate at which it lends
money to commercial banks, which would normally be a signal for
banks to reduce interest rates.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay Viravan, who is
also finance minister, said the banks need not wait for an
announcement from the Bank of Thailand to approve the interest
cut.
</P>
<P>
Thai Farmers Bank President, Bantoon Lamsam, said commercial
banks have adequate liquidity to support the interest rate cut.
</P>
<P>
Olarn said he believed interest rates could be cut by a further
one or two percentage points, but he warned that the cut was
unlikely to turn the economy around. It would help ensure the
situation did not degenerate father.
</P>
<P>
He added that the minimum lending rate reduction would benefit
domestic businesses more than exporters, because exporters could
normally get loans at a cheaper rate through packing credit.

YANGON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar's industry growth reached
5.2 percent in the just-ended 1996-97 fiscal year, according to
the latest official statistics.
</P>
<P>
The 1996-97 is the first fiscal year of Myanmar's present
five-year plan (1996-97 to 2000-2001).
</P>
<P>
During the previous four-year plan (1992-93 to 1995-96), the
industrial sector achieved an average growth of 9.05 percent.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has set the target of 10.7 percent growth of the sector
in the 1997-98, the second year of the five-year plan.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's agriculture accounts for the majority of the national
gross domestic product, in which the industrial sector shares a

</P>
<P>
The government has called for greater efforts for promotion of
the private sector's involvement in the industrial sector.

WUHAN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Some imposing cliff carvings done by
well-known Chinese calligraphers are taking shape on the cliffs
above the Xiling Gorge, one of the Yangtze River's scenic Three
Gorges.
</P>
<P>
This "Number One View of Cliff Carvings of the Three Gorges" is

<HEADLINE> China's Salar People Finding New Life (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- For centuries, the peace and order
of the agricultural community of Xunhua in northwest China's
Qinghai Province was maintained by the simple principle: "men
plough the fields and women weave."
</P>
<P>
One couple here still weave and plough, but local people envy
their production abilities. Han Haqimei, a 45-year-old woman,
heads a knitting mill with five workshops and 80 employees, while
her 48-year-old husband, Han Yibula, manages a large tract of
farmland and raises livestock.
</P>
<P>
They belong to the Salar ethnic group and the wife has become a
well-known entrepreneur of the province, sitting in an office
equipped with a long-distance telephone. She wears the kerchief
worn by Moslem women, but other people point out that her family
"no longer lives on a small piece of land, with a single cow, and
a pile of needles and thread."
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s and 1970s, the couple were leading a life so
typical of other local farmers, with not more than 50 kilograms of
grain a year, barely surviving. To get food, they planted
vegetables and traded them on the sly.
</P>
<P>
But, when the country began its reforms and opening-up in 1979,
changes began to take place in the Han's hometown, which is in the
only county solely under Salar control. And today the Salar people
have become one of the wealthiest groups on the Qinghai-Tibet
plateau.
</P>
<P>
Flags indicating Salar stores or hotels can be seen in small
towns on the Gobi, at the foot of snow-capped mountains, or in
remote corners of the plateau. A transportation service run by
Salar people, which owns 300 passenger buses, now controls tourism
from the city of Golmud to Lhasa. They even organize trips to
Dunhuang, Urumqi, Yining, and Chengdu and other distant areas.
</P>
<P>
The group also mines gold, collecting medicinal herbs, builds
houses and bridges, and sells vegetables, fruits, and livestock.
</P>
<P>
In March of last year, Han Haqimei spent two million yuan
(about 242,000 US dollars) setting up the knitting mill she heads,
and its yak-hair sweaters now sell in Qinghai, Gansu, Shaanxi, and
Heilongjiang provinces, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, and
even in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Before she became manager of the mill, Han Haqimei planted
vegetables and fruits, and raised chickens, and her husband worked
the land, mined gold, handled building projects, and studied the
Tibetan language, after having travelled to most parts of
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, he invested in 167 hectares of barren land in a
mountainous area, and last year, produced 50,000 kg of wheat,
15,000 kg of rapeseed and peas. He also raised 550 head of cattle
and goats, earning a 100,000 yuan, and using their manure as
fertilizer for the barren land. He also hires workers during the
busy farming season.
</P>
<P>
Their son and daughter and son-in-law also have several jobs,
such as running a department store and a long-distance transport
business.
</P>
<P>
Through several years of work, the family has gained much
business experience and a large amount of capital. Han Yibula
says that the reforms and opening-up have given them "the key to
the gold warehouse."

<P>
Sociologists say that the family reflect an agricultural
community's ideal of peace and order -- the men ploughing the
fields and women weaving -- but also the fundamental changes in
the Salar ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
There are nearly 70,000 people in the Salar ethnic group, who
are Moslems with their own language. In the late Yuan Dynasty
(1271-1368), they migrated from central Asia to the Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau. It took them 700 years to change their undertaking from
animal husbandry to farming, and it is only in the past 20 years
that industry and modern management techniques have begun to
affect them.
</P>
<P>
Xunhua County now has 1,200 town and township enterprises,
with an annual output worth 130 million yuan. It is known as
China's largest yak-hair production center, with a third of the
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau's yak-hair production. It has 40 knitting
mills, producing more than 300,000 sweaters each year.
</P>
<P>
Han Shangwen, the county magistrate, says that Xunhua has
undergone rapid and profound changes in recent years. The Salar
are "flexible, innovative and persevering," he says. In an age of
government reforms and opening-up policies, the Salar are taking
to them like "ducks to water."
</P>
<P>
The county has even set up an industrial zone and plans to set
up a yak-hair production group with 4,000 employees. Han Haqimei's
knitting mill will also expand production and produce 100,000
sweaters this year.
</P>
<P>
It also plans to develop new techniques for planting soy beans,
potatoes, and broad beans. Han Yibula has bought 490 kg of plastic
sheeting and has hired agronomists to consult with them on
vegetable planting.
</P>
<P>
With help from the World Food Program and the International
Fund for Agricultural Development, the county has developed an
80-million-yuan (about 963,000 US dollars) agricultural project on
2,000 hectares of barren land.

<HEADLINE> Big Foreign Investment in China Forecast for 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The amount of foreign investment
expected in China this year is estimated at 30-40 billion US dollars,
Beijing's "Outlook" magazine reported today.
</P>
<P>
Although the figure is smaller than that for 1996, it is still
large for China's economic development, according to Li Xiaoxi, a
researcher with the State Council's Research Office.
</P>
<P>
He gives four reasons for this:
</P>
<P>
-- China will adopt more flexible macro-economic control
measures after having successfully controlled its over-heated
economic growth;
</P>
<P>
-- The acceleration of the reform of state-owned enterprises
and economic development in central and western parts of the
country will provide overseas investors with more opportunities;
</P>
<P>
-- Continued global economic development will stimulate the
flow of international funds; and
</P>
<P>
-- The return of Hong Kong on July 1 add it to the economy.
</P>
<P>
According to figures from the State Statistics Bureau, China
brought in 4.66 billion US dollars worth of overseas investment in
the first two months of this year, up 1.5 percent from the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
Ma Xiuhong, director of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation's Foreign Investment Department, says that
the government is optimistic about foreign investment for this
year.
</P>
<P>
China is now the second largest user of funds in the world
after the United States. Last year, it used 55.2 billion US
dollars-worth of foreign investment, 42.35 billion dollars of
which were direct investment from abroad, a rise of 14.2 percent
and 12.2 percent respectively.

WASHINGTON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- A skydiving plane crashed in a
field of sugar beets between Miami and the Everglades in Florida

</P>
<P>
A sixth skydiver jumped out before the crash and safely floated
to the ground, according to media reports.

<HEADLINE> Poles Vote on New Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Poles cast their ballots today in a
national referendum to decide whether to adopt a new constitution
drafted by the ruling Democratic Left Alliance.
</P>
<P>
The proposed constitution was adopted by the Polish parliament
on April 2 and ratified by President Aleksander Kwasniewski, but
was rejected by the opposition Solidarity Trade Union.
</P>
<P>
If the referendum's official returns scheduled for release on
Tuesday show a simple majority approval rate, it will be the first
new constitution after the tremendous political change in 1989.
</P>
<P>
While broadly retaining the current political system, the
constitution will weaken the presidency, limit budgetary spending
and obliges the government to support employment and home building.
</P>
<P>
Today, some 22,000 polling stations staffed with 15,000 workers
were opened at 6:00 a.m. local time and closed at 10 p.m.. No
anti-referendum incidents were reported across the nation.
</P>
<P>
Polish President Kwasniewski, Prime Minister Wlodzimierz
Cimoszewicz and other officials took part in today's vote.

<HEADLINE> Background: ABCs of Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR (105-106) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Following are the ABCs of the Basic
Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (105-106) in a
question-and-answer format:
</P>
<P>
Question: Why has the Chinese side invited advisors on Hong
Kong affairs and advisors on district affairs?
</P>
<P>
Answer: It is a concrete step taken by the Chinese government
to promote the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong as well as a
smooth transfer of government there by relying on the local
people, to pool their wisdom for the purpose, to promote their
participation in transition-related affairs, and to better
implement the policies of "one country, two systems," "Hong Kong
people governing Hong Kong" and "a high-degree of autonomy for
Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong affairs advisors are invited jointly by the State
Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office and the Hong Kong
Branch of Xinhua News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Candidates are mainly people from social circles in Hong Kong
who have made contributions to local social stability and economic
prosperity. They are invited in an individual capacity. Their main
responsibilities are:
</P>
<P>
1) to reflect public opinions in Hong Kong;
</P>
<P>
2) to offer views on affairs relating to Hong Kong's latter
transitional period;
</P>
<P>
3) to study specific issues;
</P>
<P>
and 4) to explain related Chinese policies to Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
So far, four groups totalling 186 people have been invited as
advisors on Hong Kong affairs.
</P>
<P>
Advisors of district affairs are invited by the Hong Kong
Branch of Xinhua News Agency. Its members are mainly people who
are familiar with district affairs, have rich experience in
district services and have made contributions in this regard.
</P>
<P>
They are also invited in an individual capacity. Their main
responsibilities are:
</P>
<P>
-- to reflect opinions of Hong Kong people;
</P>
<P>
-- to actively publicize the Basic Law;
</P>
<P>
-- to promote broad participation of Hong Kong people in social
affairs;
</P>
<P>
-- and to offer views and suggestions on major
transition-related affairs.
</P>
<P>
So far, two groups totalling 537 people have been invited as
advisors on district affairs.

<TEXT>
<P>
In the past several years, the advisors have offered many
constructive views and suggestions concerning the maintenance of
Hong Kong's stability and prosperity and the achievement of its
smooth transition, playing an important role in assisting the
Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office and the Hong Kong Branch of
Xinhua News Agency in properly handling transition-related
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Question: What is the Preliminary Working Committee? Why was it
established? What has it done?
</P>
<P>
Answer: The Preliminary Working Committee of the Preparatory
Committee for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (PWC) is
an institution established in accordance with a decision made in
July 1993 by the Eighth National People's Congress Standing
Committee at its second session.
</P>
<P>
Its responsibility was to make preparatory work for China's
resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong and the
achievement of its smooth transition prior to the establishment of
the Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
The committee was composed of personages of various social
circles and specialists in the mainland and Hong Kong, with those
from Hong Kong constituting no less than 50 percent of all its
members.
</P>
<P>
The PWC ceased to function after the establishment of the
Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong SAR in January, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Establishment of the PWC is the best possible way to do
preparatory work for the Hong Kong SAR and organize the
participation of Hong Kong people in transition-related affairs at
a time when the British side refuses to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
For the Chinese side, it was a practical step of "starting up
another stove," of winning time, and of taking the
initiative. Otherwise, there would be too little time for the
Preparatory Committee, which would not be established until 1996,
to accomplish all transition-related work before July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Under the PWC are five subgroups dealing respectively with
political affairs, legal affairs, the economy, culture, social
affairs and public security.
</P>
<P>
Their work was to study related issues, offer views and
suggestions on the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR and the
achievement of Hong Kong's smooth transition, and do all necessary
work for the establishment and operation of the Preparatory
Committee in 1996 and China's resumption of the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
Altogether, the PWC held six plenary sessions, and made
preliminary studies of all important issues, for example:
</P>
<P>
The political sub-group devoted itself mainly to the study
of questions that are directly related to the establishment of the
Hong Kong SAR. It put forward "Detailed Plan for the
Establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region," a suggestion on the organization
of th first government of the Hong Kong SAR (including the
selection committee, the chief executive, the executive council,
governmental organs, principal officials and advisory bodies), and
a suggestion on the establishment of a provisional legislature.
</P>
<P>
Matters studied by the sub-group include: how to maintain the
stability of the civil service, the transfer of files on civil
servants, establishment of a Basic Law committee, and establishment
of the Hong Kong SAR's judicial organs and court of final appeal.
</P>
<P>
The economic sub-group devoted itself mainly to economic
issues. These included: big capital construction projects that
straddle 1997 (including financial arrangements for the new
airport, draft regulations for the administration of the airport,
sewage projects, and a land reclamation project at the Victoria
Harbor), co-ordination of large infrastructure projects in the
mainland and Hong Kong, land and housing policies, economic and
trade relations between the mainland and Hong Kong after 1997,
maintenance of the pegged exchange system for the Hong Kong
dollar, the pension system, and the transfer and management of
land funds.
</P>
<P>
The legal affairs sub-group proposed a whole set of methods
for dealing with existing laws in Hong Kong, studied the
establishment of a provisional legislative council in Hong Kong
from a legal perspective, and examined Hong Kong's existing laws
and regulations.
</P>
<P>
The cultural sub-group studied issues concerning: the
publicizing of the Basic Law, convergence of textbooks, names of
public institutions in Hong Kong, methods for the handling of
emblems, flags and seals, public holidays, records of schooling,
and basic principles for public education.
</P>
<P>
The social and public security sub-group focused on the
following issues: entry-and-exit freedom, the right of abode in
Hong Kong for offspring born in the mainland, of Chinese citizens
among permanent residents in Hong Kong, the permanent residence
status, passport and travel documents of returned emigrants, and
publicly-managed housing.

<HEADLINE> Italian President Calls for National Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro
called for national unity today while the separatist Northern
League held a referendum on splitting the north from Italy.
</P>
<P>
National unity is "untouchable," Scalfaro told a ceremony in
Palermo marking the 50th anniversary of the inaugural sessions of
the Sicilian regional parliament.
</P>
<P>
He said one of the essential conditions for autonomy is
solidarity, which the Northern League has always bridled at.
</P>
<P>
Without solidarity between different parts of the country, the
president said, "autonomy turns into the uncivilized law of the
strongest."
</P>
<P>
On the call for federal reforms, he said, any such moves should
strengthen rather than weaken the concept of national unity while
enhancing local identities and autonomies.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the center-right Christian Democratic Center
presented a federal reform blueprint which, if implemented, would
give Italy the most federalist institutional framework in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The Constituent Assembly is writing down the precepts of a
"single and indivisible republic," Scalfaro told his audience at
the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The Northern League party staged the unofficial referendum in
11 of the country's 20 regions, setting up tents at 13,000 sites
as polling stations for voters aged 16 and above to say "Yes" or
"No" to its drive for a "federal, independent and sovereign
republic of Padania."
</P>
<P>
Results of the ballot are expected to be announced on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The party switched to separatism from a federalist agenda last
year after it failed to win the balance of power in parliamentary
elections.
</P>
<P>
It also lost control of Milan, Italy's main northern city, in
recent local elections.
</P>
<P>
In an unrelated incident, eight members of a separatist
paramilitary group occupied the bell tower in Venice this month to
publicize a drive for an independent Venetian republic.
</P>
<P>
The eight youth were later arrested by commandos in a tense
operation and went on trial last week.

<HEADLINE> Italy Congratulates Iran's Khatami on Winning Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government today sent its
congratulations to Mohammed Khatami on his landslide victory in
Iran's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Khatami, a moderate former culture minister, won more than 20
million popular votes in the election on Friday, almost three
times the votes received by Nateq-Nouri.
</P>
<P>
This was the highest support rate for an Iranian president
since the victory of the Islamic revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The Italian Foreign Ministry said it hoped that the
president-elect will be able to lead Iran toward strengthening
relations with Italy and the rest of Europe.
</P>
<P>
It also said the incident-free election is satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
Iran's ties with European Union countries suffered its latest
setback after a German court ruled that Iran was behind the 1992
assassination of Kurdish dissidents in Berlin's Mykonos restaurant.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member bloc recalled their ambassadors and suspended its
policy of "critical dialogue" with Iran, which retaliated with a
temporary ban on German ambassador Horst Beschmann's return to the
Iranian capital Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said last week that
Bonn will have to rectify its mistake in implicating Iran in the
Mykonos killings before relations are improved.

<HEADLINE> Thai PM Promises New Measures to Boost Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh has promised a package of measures to boost export
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
At a three-day "export summit" being held in Pattaya, Chavalit
promised tax reform, revamp of the customs and excise departments,
financial support, relaxed commercial policy, labor force skill
training, and a change of attitude by officials.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which began on Sunday and is attended by Chavalit,
Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Amnuay Viravan, and
Commerce Minister Narongchai Akrasanee, with 31 selected leading
exporters, industrialists and bankers, are aimed at seeking ways
to boost exports, which is the fundamental sector for reviving
Thailand's economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's export growth has been faltering during the past 18
months and the government hopes to achieve a 10-percent growth
this year.
</P>
<P>
However, local businessmen said the best that can be expected
is 7 to 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Thailand now needs structural as well as cyclical
adjustments to revive its exports, which registered a near-zero
growth last year.

<HEADLINE> Largest Tomb In Three Gorges to be Excavated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists are set to
excavate the largest tomb discovered in the Three Gorges Area
where China's large dam project is under way.
</P>
<P>
The tomb is located in Yunyang County in Chongqing City in
southwestern China and probably belonged to a noble of the Chu
State in the Zhou Dynasty (11th Century-221 BC), according to
Prof. Yu Weichao, curator of Beijing's Chinese History Museum.
</P>
<P>
Yu, who is the head of Group for the Cultural Relics Protection
in the Three Gorges area, said that the tomb is expected to be the
largest Chu tomb ever excavated. Six burial rooms have been
discovered, the largest measuring 12 by 8 m.
</P>
<P>
Above the burial rooms is a mound of earth with a base 80m in
diameter and a height of 25 m. In the upper part of the mound
there are at least eight brick tombs from the Han Dynasty (206
BC-220 AD). Swords and pottery in the Chu style have been found
near the mound.
</P>
<P>
Yu said that the excavation is expected to contribute to the
study of Chu origins and its relation with the Ba culture, because
the tomb is located in a boundary area between the two cultures.

of domestically-made aircraft throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of China (BOC) recently signed an agreement with the
China Aero-Technology Import and Export Corp (CATIC) to act as the
company's major sponsoring bank, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
As the primary channel for China's overseas aircraft and
component sales, CATIC sold 82 civil aircraft valued at 250
million US dollars in the 1985-1996 period, said CATIC's president
Yang Chunshu.
</P>
<P>
CATIC officials have predicted good business prospects, based
on strong market demands in developing countries in Africa, South
America, and the South Pacific archipelago.
</P>
<P>
China's financial and industrial authorities last year designed a
"sponsoring bank system", under which each of the country's 300
best state-owned enterprises is required to link itself to one of
the four state commercial banks. The purpose is to ensure a clear,
stable relationship between the banks and industry.
</P>
<P>
BOC concentrated on loans to the country's foreign traders and
in hard currency loans to China's key projects.
</P>
<P>
"Although we had long been in a special business area in the
past, we are determined to compete for strong clients like CATIC,"
a BOC official said.
</P>
<P>
The bank has provided 10 billion yuan (1.2 billion US dollars)
in loans to the CATIC so far.

<HEADLINE> Dong Has Tough Time in Badminton Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GLASGOW, Scotland, May 23 (Xinhua) -- China's Olympic men's
singles runner-up Dong Jiong and defending women's singles world
champion Ye Zhaoying are favored to win their events at the World
Badminton Championships.
</P>
<P>
The first stage, or qualifying round, begins here on Sunday but
Dong and Ye have to wait until Tuesday for an outing.
</P>
<P>
Dong won the famed All England Open in March but he needs a
world title to prove his supremacy.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old Chinese will have tough battles on his way to
the top of the podium as he has several strong rivals to beat.
</P>
<P>
Dong, ranked No. 1 in the world, is to meet the tenth-seeded
Thomas Stuer-Lauridsen of Denmark in the last 16 and Malaysia's
Ong Ewe Hock or defending champion Heryanto Arbi of Indonesia in
the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
Denmark's Olympic champion Poul-Erik Hoyer-Larsen is probably
the only European hope in the men's singles fray.
</P>
<P>
He beat defending champion Heryanto Arbi in a Sudirman Cup
match to avenge his All England loss. Arbi is now troubled with
injuries.
</P>
<P>
The second-seeded Dane is expected to beat China's 14th seed
Luo Yigang in the last 16 and to face fifth seed Joko Suprianto of
Indonesia in the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
In the women's singles event, Ye Zhaoying, defending champion
and All-England Open winner, who lost to Indonesia's Susi Susanti
in the Sudirman Cup semi-finals, will have little trouble until
she meets Ra Kyung Min of South Korea in the last eight.
</P>
<P>
Ye's compatriot Gong Zhichao, world No. 2 , is expected to take
on Susanti in the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
Han Jingna, runner-up in the 1995 Worlds, is tipped to vie for
a semi-final berth with fourth-seeded Camilla Martin of Denmark,
the only European hope in the event.
</P>
<P>
China's Olympic champions Ge Fei and Gu Jun are undisputedly
the best women's doubles pair here and the world championship is
the only honor that has eluded them. Their strongest threat could
be Indonesian duo of Eliza and Rosiana Zelin.
</P>
<P>
In the men's doubles competition, the big names are Indonesia's
Olympic titlists Ricky Subagja and Rexy Mainaky, their Olympic
final rivals Cheah Soon Kit and Yap Kim Hock of Malaysia, and
fellow countrymen Candra Wijaya and Budiarto Sigit.
</P>
<P>
For the mixed doubles, China's combination Liu Yong and Ge Fei,
who has won the All England event and three other titles this
year, is hot favorites.
</P>
<P>
Other names to watch are Indonesia's Trikus Heryanto and
Minarti Timur, currently world No. 1 pair, and Danish combination
of Michael Sogaard and Rikke Olsen.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Controls Land Sinkage by Rational Use of Groundwater </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's leading
industrial city, has controlled land sinkage by the rational
pumping of groundwater.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the city witnessed less than 10 milimeters
of sinkage between 1991 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
A report from the hydrogeological investigation shows the
annual amount of the city's extractable groundwater is 571 million
cubic meters; only one fourth of that amount is pumped every year.
</P>
<P>
The report said Shanghai's 1,383 deep wells annually pump
128 million cubic meters of groundwater, 30 percent for industrial
use and the rest for residents' daily use.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the 1990s, Shanghai has been putting
more running water into the ground. It planned in 1996 to reduce
the pumping of groundwater by five million cubic meters each year,
in an effort to curb the excessive pumping of groundwater in
Wujing and other industrial areas of the city.
</P>
<P>
So far, Shanghai's annual amount of running water on ground
comes to 22.41 million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the annual extraction amount in the
urban areas stood at 9.16 million cubic meters, while the running
water volume came to 15.64 million cubic meters.

<HEADLINE> Downer Says Australia's Destiny Linked with Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Australian Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer said Australia's destiny was inextricably linked
with the Asia region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a state dinner Sunday night for visiting Chinese
Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, Downer described Australia's relationship
with China as being of fundamental importance, citing the strong
investment link as well as trade relationships as factors that
"bind our two countries together".
</P>
<P>
Downer said Australia's relationship with China was
"fundamentally important partly for economic reason but also
because we are partners together in the Pacific region," the
Australian Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
He said after Hong Kong's return to China, China would become
Australia's second largest trading partner.
</P>
<P>
Further cementing the relationship between the two countries
was the fact that Australia had become China's "largest
destination for overseas investment", the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
"Importantly Australia and China can be described as partners
in building a peaceful, prosperous and cooperative Asia-pacific
region," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Australia is deeply committed to our engagement with Asia as
our highest foreign policy priority and Australia indeed sees its
destiny as inextricably linked with the Asian region," said
Downer.

<HEADLINE> China Develops First Robot Able to Perform Brain Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Scientists have developed China's
first robot capable of performing brain surgery, and the
mechanical man has passed the technical assessment.
</P>
<P>
Combining robotics technology, computer technology and
sterotaxic neurosurgery technology, the robot was jointly
developed by the Robot Institute associated with Beijing
University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, and the General
Hospital of the Navy of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say the robot is capable of precision surgical
techniques, can work in a shorter period of time, and does not use
general anesthesia.
</P>
<P>
On May 5, the PLA hospital successfully carried out a brain
operation using the newly-developed robot to remove a tumor from
the craniopharyngeal canal of a nine-year-old. The patient was
discharged from hospital on May 12.
</P>
<P>
It was the first operation of its kind performed by a robot in
China.

<HEADLINE> IBF Says No to 9-point Scoring System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GLASGOW, Scotland, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The International
Badminton Federation (IBF) on Sunday ruled out the nine-point
scoring system.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which was raised by Norway and seconded by
England at the IBF General Annual Meeting, suggests the phase-in
of the nine-point scoring system for all five individual events of
men's and women's singles, men's and women's doubles and mixed
doubles.
</P>
<P>
But most delegates from a record 103 member associations
attending the meeting opposed the proposal in the discussion
before Norway withdrew it.
</P>
<P>
The new system, which also changed the present best-of-three
game format to best-of-five, was trialed at the Dutch Open last
October.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from Indonesia and Malaysia strongly opposed the
proposal, saying it was still too early to judge whether the
change was good for the sport.
</P>
<P>
They called for more alternatives to trial for reform of the
scoring system in order to make the sport more attractive to
spectators and help television coverage.
</P>
<P>
According to the present rules, the shuttler or pair who score
15 points first wins a game. But due to the setting system, the
score could also be 17 or 18 points, causing confusions among
spectators unfamiliar with the sport.
</P>
<P>
The women's singles is slightly different. The one who gets 11
points first wins a game but the score could also be 12 because of
the setting.
</P>
<P>
The IBF said they would continue to test the new system at
future competitions.

issued by the spokesman of the the Secretary-General.
</P>

</P>

<P>
PARIS, May 25 (Xinhua) -- President Jacques Chirac is now
facing a possible cohabitation or sharing of power with the
opposition left parties after the center-right suffered a
"warning shot" in the first round of the legislative elections
today.
</P>
<P>
According to various estimations, the Socialist Party and the
Communist Party have won 38 to 40 percent of the votes, against 33
to 36 percent by the outgoing ruling center-right majority,
carrying it off for the first time since the Socialist Party under
former President Francois Mitterrand was overwhelmed by the
center-right in the 1993 legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
The leftist parties could well form a majority after the second
round of the elections to be held on June 1, as all estimations
have predicted a follow-up left-wing victory in the second round.
</P>
<P>
Both the left parties and the center-right parties launched a
mobilization of their partisans this evening to fight a last ditch
battle in the remaining week.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Alain Juppe, who won only 35.7 percent of the
votes in the second constituency in Bordeaux as a parliamentary
deputy candidate, promised "real change with new and modern
idea" if the center-right maintains power.
</P>
<P>
He said that there exists a "important capacity for
mobilization in the second round" of the elections.
</P>
<P>
Francois Leotard, the president of the centrist Union for the
French Democracy which forms the former majority with the Rally
for the Republic, said that a power led by the Socialist Party and
the Communist Party will "estrange France from Europe."
</P>
<P>
While recognizing "part of the responsibility" by the
center-right for the election result today, Leotard said that the
ruling majority has not "sufficiently expressed the part of
novelty, change and elan."
</P>
<P>
The Socialist Party first secretary Lionel Jospin said that the
result shows that the proposals of the Socialist Party have been
understood by the French people, and that the progress made by the
leftists indicates that the French people want the future to be
guided by the leftist forces.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party national secretary Robert Hue said that "a
dynamism of rally (by leftist forces) can affirm and allow the
election next Sunday of a left majority."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the spokesman for the outgoing ruling majority
Patrick Stefanini said that today's election result was "an
expression of a strong disappointment" by the French people.

<HEADLINE> French Leftist Parties Beat Center-Right in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 25 (Xinhua) -- France's leftist parties today beat
the outgoing center-right majority in the first round of the
legislative elections, winning about 38.4 percent of the votes,
against 33.3 percent of the center-right parties.
</P>
<P>
According to a newest estimation jointly made by the SOFRES
polling group, TF1 television station and RTL radio station, after
the second round of the legislative elections to be held on
June 1, the outgoing majority of Rally for the Republic and Union
for the French Democracy will keep 255 to 287 seats in the
National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Socialist Party will win 242 to 272 seats, the
Communist Party 21 to 30 seats, the National Front zero to three
seats.
</P>
<P>
This means that the Socialist Party and the Communist Party
will have from 263 to 302 seats, compared with 255 to 287 seats of
the center-right. The absolute parliamentary majority should be
289 seats.
</P>
<P>
Another estimation jointly made by the CSA polling group,
France 3 television station and Radio France said that the leftist
parties will win 269 to 298 seats, while the center-right will
obtain 265 to 285 seats in the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
A third estimation made by the BVA polling institute said that
the leftist parties will win 272 to 302 parliament seats after the
second round of the election, while the center-right alliance will
only win 250 to 270 seats.
</P>
<P>
The extreme right National Front for the first time will enter
the French parliament by winning more than 12.5 percent of the
votes required for entry.
</P>
<P>
Both the Socialist Party leader Lionel Jospin and the Communist
Party leader Robert Hue called for a rally by the leftist forces
in the second round of the election.
</P>
<P>
Jospin said in a declaration broadcast by all television
channels that what is important now is that the leftist forces
should rally with each other, and he proposed "a pact of change"
to put France back "on a march by all and for all."
</P>
<P>
He hailed that the French people have "expressed themselves
with a great force" in the election.
</P>
<P>
Robert Hue said that the answer of the French people to a
request by President Jacques Chirac to send a blank check to the
center-right majority for another five years is -- "No."
</P>
<P>
The extreme-right National Front party leader Jean-Marie Le Pen
said that President Chirac has been beaten in the election and
"he should go."
