<HEADLINE> Weaver Leads 77-Car Rolex 24 Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- The pole-winning Riley &AMP; Scott Ford  
driven by James Weaver stayed in the lead Saturday at the start of 
the Rolex 24. 
</P>
<P>
	The twice-around-the-clock sports car event at Daytona  
International Speedway got off to a clean start at 1 p.m. EST, with 
little change among the top qualifiers in the 77-car field. 
</P>
<P>
	Englishman Weaver was to take turns in the cockpit with Dorsey  
Schroeder, Stuart Hayner and team owner Rob Dyson. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the entries chasing them on the 3.56-mile, 11-turn road  
circuit -- encompassing about three-quarters of the 2 1/2-mile NASCAR 
oval and an infield course -- were a phalanx of Ferrari 333SP Can-Am 
cars, including the team that won last year's Rolex 24. 
</P>
<P>
	After the first few laps, that car had slipped from second to  
third, following the Ferrari of LeMans winner Allan McNish. Didier 
Theys kept the defending champions third, followed by the Ferrari 
of Max Papis. 
</P>
<P>
	The premier endurance race in the United States began under  
sunny skies with unseasonably warm temperatures expected to reach 
the lower 80s. Overnight, the temperature was to remain in the 40s, 
with another warm day expected Sunday. The only cloud on the 
horizon was the possibility of showers sometime during the final 
hours of the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Drivers who might have dreaded night racing in the past were not  
quite as fearful this year because the track will use its new 
lighting system -- installed last year for NASCAR's Pepsi 400 -- at 
20-percent power to shed some light on the entire course. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's probably going to change the way everybody views this  
race at night,'' Theys said ``The spectators will be able to see 
more, including the numbers on the cars, and the drivers will have 
an easier time seeing where they are, particularly in the infield 
section.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weaver, who appeared to be cruising in the early going, said  
before the race began, ``The main thing is to get through the early 
hours without too much difficulty and then just try to keep up a 
good pace. 
</P>
<P>
	``By morning, there will be less traffic because there will be  
fewer cars out there. Then, if we're still in position, we can 
think about winning.''

<HEADLINE> Church Group Allows Same-Sex Unions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- A Presbyterian church group that  
represents 20,000 faithful in seven New York counties voted 
Saturday to allow ministers to perform same-sex holy unions that 
stop short of marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that God's tears are a lot less every time we affirm  
monogamy over promiscuity,'' said the Rev. Steve Geckeler, minister 
of the Presbyterian Church in White Plains. His church hosted the 
Presbytery of the Hudson River, comprised of ministers and lay 
members from 96 churches who approved the motion by a vote of 107 
to 35. 
</P>
<P>
	However, ``a marriage is still understood as being between a man  
and a woman,'' said Geckeler, who has not himself performed any 
same-gender unions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Presbytery voted three months after a Presbytery committee  
began investigating the South Presbyterian Church in nearby Dobbs 
Ferry, which openly holds same-sex unions. The committee found the 
unions are allowed, but don't constitute marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	The national office of the Presbyterian Church (USA) will likely  
consider whether the vote conforms to church law, said Fred 
Jenkins, associate stated clerk of the Protestant denomination's 
General Assembly in Louisville, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2.7 million-member denomination's Book of Order does not  
mention same-sex unions specifically, but church officials have 
recommended that ministers do not perform ceremonies that are the 
``same as a marriage ceremony.''

<HEADLINE> Russian IOCer Supports Samaranch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Russian IOC member, one of three members who remain under  
investigation in the Salt Lake City bribery scandal, said he and 
IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch have plenty of support. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are receiving dozens of letters signed by champions from  
all countries, supporting Samaranch, supporting what we're doing 
and supporting me,'' Vitaly Smirnov, president of the Russian 
Olympic Committee, was quoted Saturday as saying in the Swiss 
newspaper Le Temps. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine other members have either resigned or been expelled over  
alleged bribes during the successful campaign by Salt Lake City to 
host the 2002 Winter Games. Another has received a warning. 
</P>
<P>
	And the list appears to be growing.  
</P>
<P>
	IOC vice president Dick Pound said Friday an ``indefinite  
number'' of names from the 106 committee members have been added to 
the inquiry since its initial report on the Salt Lake City case was 
released last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound refused to identify the recent additions.  
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said Smirnov is being investigated for ``benefits  
received by third parties as a result of his intervention, and 
excessive gifts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smirnov has denied the charges, and said in the interview that  
it probably was time for him to leave the IOC. But he said he was 
so angry by what had happened that he was considering running for 
IOC president when Samaranch's tenure ends in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quite simply, my dignity has been wounded,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--The New York Times reported that leaders of Salt Lake's effort  
to get the Games set up a four-year campaign in 1991 that included 
giving financial assistance to people influential in picking the 
host city. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign was outlined in a document presented in December  
1991 to business leaders that oversaw the Olympic bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Included in a budget summary presented at a meeting of the bid  
committee's board of trustees was a projection to spend about 
$500,000 on help to national Olympic committees and contracts with 
``key individuals'' in three areas of the world, the Times 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	An IOC report that recommended Ecuadorian IOC member Augustin  
Arroyo's expulsion last week showed that his stepdaughter received 
$19,000 from Salt Lake City Olympic officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Documents showed that on Aug. 17, 1993, the committee paid the  
stepdaughter's $701.54 American Express bill. 
</P>
<P>
	--Broadcasting chief Manolo Romero will meet with the Sydney  
Olympic organizing committee following allegations he received a $1 
million kickback while broadcasting chief for the 1992 Barcelona 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Romero, the chief executive officer of the Sydney Olympic  
Broadcasting Organization, denied the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	--Chinese Olympic Committee honorary president He Zhenliang, who  
also is an IOC executive board member, voiced strong support for 
reforming the IOC after its worst corruption scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the IOC is working on new rules in the bidding  
procedures and hoped the change would help repair the 
organization's image. 
</P>
<P>
	--Kim Un-Yong, a powerful South Korean member of the IOC  
executive board, refused to meet with journalists over the 
continuing investigation into his allegations of misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim is the biggest name among the 13 IOC members linked to the  
Salt Lake scandal. He is part of the IOC's powerful inner circle 
and considered a possible candidate to succeed Samaranch as 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, he said the allegations against him were an attempt  
to defame him before the campaign to choose Samaranch's successor.

<HEADLINE> Suspected Terrorist Nabbed in D.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. Park Police officers detained a man near  
the White House Saturday after police said the Secret Service 
described him as a possible terrorist. Secret Service officials 
swiftly announced there was no terrorist connection. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a person we have come into contact with before,''  
Secret Service spokesman Jim Mackin said. He described the man's 
detention and questioning as routine and voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is not a terrorist. There is nothing linking him to any  
terrorist organization. He had no weapons, made no threats,'' 
Mackin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Park Police detained the man at midafternoon near the Ellipse, a  
grassy area outside the White House's south gate, and took him to 
the Secret Service's Washington field office for questioning, said 
Lt. Cheryl Braun. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers were alerted at midday to look for a man spotted  
``acting suspiciously'' in the White House tour line. Park Police 
Sgt. Michael Keenan said the Secret Service fingered the man as a 
possible terrorist and ordered him detained. 
</P>
<P>
	Another official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the  
buzz about a suspected terrorist link began when the man, familiar 
to officers around the White House as a homeless man, dropped a 
piece of paper bearing the name of a known terrorist organization. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and the first lady left the White House at  
midday and helicoptered to the presidential retreat at Camp David 
for a long-planned weekend respite.

<HEADLINE> NORAD To End Regular Public Tours </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- Fears about increased terrorism  
worldwide are bringing an end to regular public tours of the 
nation's missile-tracking headquarters, a 4.5-acre granite bunker 
buried 1,700 feet beneath a peak in the Rocky Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	The North American Aerospace Defense Command, known as NORAD,  
will continue tours of its underground base for certain groups, but 
only after visitors pass background checks. Scheduled tour 
reservations will be honored through early April. 
</P>
<P>
	No specific threat prompted the change in security at the center  
beneath Cheyenne Mountain, but terrorist bombings like the attacks 
on embassies in Africa last year raised new fears, said Navy Cmdr. 
Dave Knox, a base spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are able to bring smaller and smaller objects in that  
can do a lot of damage. That is a concern,'' Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
	The base, which opened in 1966, features 2.8 miles of tunnels,  
3-foot-thick blast doors and buildings set atop mammoth metal coils 
that serve as shock absorbers. 
</P>
<P>
	Most future tours will be confined to a building outside the  
mountain, where visitors will be able to view a video presentation 
of the base's elaborate interior.

<HEADLINE> Puerto Madero Wins Donn Handicap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HALLANDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Puerto Madero, a Chilean horse who has  
been in the United States less than a year, charged to the front 
entering the homestretch to upset the hard-charging Silver Charm in 
the $500,000 Donn Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
	Puerto Madero, the 7-2 second choice, overtook dueling leaders  
Sir Bear and Littlebitlively on the final turn and pulled away down 
the stretch to win by 2 and 3/4-lengths over Behrens. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm, whose odds fell to 4-5 by post time, couldn't  
overcome the outside post position in the 12-horse field and needed 
a fast charge to finish third by a nose in front of Hanarsaan. 
</P>
<P>
	The result marked only the second time in 21 starts that Silver  
Charm had not finished first or second. The other came in last 
July's San Diego Handicap, when he finished last in a field of 
five. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a heck of a lot more than disappointing,'' Silver Charm  
owner Bob Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	The result dealt Silver Charm a setback in his quest to become  
thoroughbred racing's first $10 million horse. The $50,000 share 
still moved Silver Charm past Alysheba into third place all-time 
with $6,683,006. 
</P>
<P>
	Puerto Madero won for the 11th time in 16 career starts, but was  
something of an unknown since the first 10 came in South America. 
The Donn was his second consecutive victory, going with the Native 
Diver Handicap last month at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Puerto Madero, with Kent Desormeaux aboard, paid $10.40, $5.60  
and $3.20 for the win. Behrens returned $9.80 and $4.80, while 
Silver Charm paid $2.40 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm, carrying a high weight of 126 pounds, never could  
get to the front as the field broke from the gate. Littlebitlively 
and local entry Sir Bear engaged in a speed duel at the front while 
Puerto Madero sat just off the leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm was ninth after the first quarter-mile and fell as  
far as 10 lengths behind along the backstretch despite constant 
urging by jockey Gary Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders began to fade around the far turn and Puerto Madero  
took advantage, shooting to the front on the outside with Behrens 
in tow. Silver Charm finally took off around the far turn, but it 
was too late. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm will return to California for an expected run in  
the Santa Anita Handicap in March, then to the Middle East to 
defend his title in the $5 million Dubai World Cup later in the 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Should Silver Charm win those races, it would leave him just  
some $316,000 shy of Cigar's record. Skip Away, last year's Donn 
winner and favorite for 1998 Horse of the Year, is second with 
$9,616,360 before retiring last November. 
</P>
<P>
	The Donn was the debut race of the NTRA Champions series, 11  
televised races designed to showcase horse racing's older 
champions. The National Thoroughbred Racing Association set up the 
series as a way to increase the sport's visibility.

	U.S. Warplanes Fire at Iraqi Sites  
</P>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- U.S. defense officials said there have  
been six separate shooting incidents today involving American jets 
patrolling the northern ``no-fly'' zone in Iraq. A spokeswoman said 
U.S. pilots fired on Iraqi defense sites after being targeted by 
radar. All confrontations took place near the city of Mosul, said a 
statement from Operation Northern Watch in the southern Turkish air 
base of Incirlik. Tensions in the region have been high due to 
repeated confrontations between U.S. and Iraqi forces in the 
northern and southern ``no-fly'' zones, set up after the 1991 Gulf 
War to protect the Kurdish and Shiite minorities in Iraq. 

</P>

	Aftershock Rattles Colombia  
</P>
<P>
	ARMENIA, Colombia (AP) -- A powerful aftershock today rocked  
western Colombia less than a week after an earthquake hit the 
country's coffee-growing region, leaving nearly 1,000 people dead. 
The 4.3 magnitude tremor caused a great deal of alarm, but there 
have been no reports of further damage or injury. Meanwhile, 
Colombian President Andres Pastrana met with his ministers to 
discuss how to jump-start a struggling relief effort. Yesterday, 
mobs frustrated with the lack of food and medicine aid ransacked a 
Red Cross warehouse and smashed into stores before the riot was 
quelled by troops firing shots and tear gas. 

</P>
<P>
	States Ponder Fed Role in Schools  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some states are crying foul over parts of  
President Clinton's $15 billion education budget, saying ``there 
should not be a common prescription for all 50 states.'' The 
president has promised to seek budget funds to ensure that schools 
stop promoting students who are failing and states fix or shut 
low-performing schools. But a Florida lawmaker says the devil is in 
the details of Clinton's plan, ``and the details are best handled 
at the local level.'' A California lawmaker says the federal 
government should create ``a national expectation of standards,'' 
but leave the rest to states.

	S. Africa Massacre Victims Buried  
</P>
<P>
	RICHMOND, South Africa (AP) -- Political leaders appealed for  
peace today while mourners buried the victims of a massacre in a 
South African town bloodied by political strife. Feuding in 
Richmond between the opposition United Democratic Movement party 
and the ruling African National Congress has cost scores of lives, 
and raised fears the violence will escalate amid preparations for 
national and provincial elections later this year. Eleven ANC 
supporters gunned down in a massacre were buried today. 

</P>
<P>
	China To Revise Constitution  
</P>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China will amend its constitution to enshrine the  
rights of private enterprise and pay homage to Deng Xiaoping, the 
man credited with launching the country's economic reforms, 
state-run media reported today. The constitutional revisions being 
considered by the National People's Congress reflect positions set 
by a key Communist Party Congress in September 1997 and are not 
major policy changes. But they do signal the ruling Communist 
Party's commitment to market-oriented economic reforms. 

</P>
<P>
	Unsafe Sex Increases Among Gays  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Federal surveys indicate that risky sexual  
behavior is on the rise in the gay community, and officials are 
concerned that if the trend continues, HIV infection rates will 
rise again. An official with an AIDS testing site says the rise in 
risk-taking is attributed to the apparent effectiveness of new AIDS 
drugs, and the cavalier attitude of young gay men who did not 
witness AIDS suffering firsthand. One AIDS testing site reported a 
50 percent increase in people testing positive for HIV since 1997.

	Lawrence Taylor Makes Hall of Fame  
</P>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Lawrence Taylor, one of the greatest linebackers in  
the history of the NFL, was elected to the Pro Football Hall of 
Fame today, ending speculation that his off-field troubles would 
keep him from being enshrined. A 10-time Pro Bowl choice and the 
league's MVP in 1986, Taylor has had several scrapes with the law 
since retiring in 1993. He was arrested twice on drug charges, was 
found guilty of filing false income tax returns and was questioned 
by a grand jury investigating organized crime. Also chosen today 
were former Rams and Colts running back Eric Dickerson and former 
Browns tight end Ozzie Newsome.

	KIEL, Germany (AP) -- German leftists pelted extreme right-wing

</P>
<P>
	More than 1,000 extreme rightists were marching to protest the

<P>
	At least 600 leftists threw stones and clashed with police, who  
ordered the march route shortened to try to contain the violence.

	Police in Kiel, the capital of Schleswig-Holstein state, said 59  
people were arrested. Two policemen, seven protesters and a 
bystander were slightly injured, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	An earlier demonstration organized by the Greens, the junior

<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The early Sunday edition of The Miami Herald  
newspaper could turn out to be a collector's item -- especially for 
the Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	A narrow strip across the top of the Super Bowl section says,  
``Denver Broncos vs. Minnesota Vikings, 6:25 p.m. Tonight.'' The 
Falcons upset the heavily favored Vikings in the NFC championship 
game on Jan. 17.

paper, being sold in the gift shop of the team hotel Saturday 
evening. ``Hey, I guess that's what everyone wanted it to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Haggerty, the Herald's assistant managing editor for  
sports, said a graphics artist began working on the special section 
more than two weeks ago and forgot to change the team names when 
the Falcons defeated Minnesota 30-27 in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the early edition is for street sales only and makes up  
a small percentage of the Herald's normal Sunday run of 500,000 
papers. He said the mistake would be corrected in all later 
editions and the newspaper would acknowledge the error in print. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made a mistake,'' Haggerty said. ``There's no doubt about  
that.''

<HEADLINE> Gary Bauer May Run for President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Conservative activist Gary Bauer plans to take  
the first step in a long-shot presidential campaign, forming an 
exploratory committee with the Federal Election Commission next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials familiar with Bauer's plans, speaking on the condition  
of anonymity, said the papers will be filed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican presidential hopeful was scheduled to appear on  
NBC's ``Meet the Press'' on Sunday, where the official said he 
would outline his plans. 
</P>
<P>
	In a recent interview, Bauer said he was encouraged by the  
reception he received at the Conservative Political Action 
Conference in Alexandria, Va., this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a real pick up since then in people calling from all  
over the country wanting to volunteer and put up the resources,'' 
Bauer said. ``I feel strongly that I have a governing vision and 
that if I get a chance to explain, I will be competitive. It will 
be a contrast to the typical politics that the American people are 
subject to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer has said he will focus on problems facing America's youth,  
including education and the ``breakdown of standards of what's 
right and wrong.'' He also has said he would seek investments in 
people, not just economic development, and would increase the 
nation's focus on foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're allowing the worst of all worlds,'' he said. ``We're  
hollowing out the military while increasing the number of 
commitments we make abroad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer, a former Reagan administration official and head of the  
Campaign for Working Families, is little-known outside the 
community of powerful social conservatives, but has shown an 
ability to raise large amounts of money. He said he can win the 
nomination and presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I thought it was a fool's errand, I wouldn't do it,'' Bauer  
said.

<HEADLINE> Will Elway Want a Three-peat? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- And so, we will witness the final game of the best  
street-ball quarterback in history, the master of improvisation and 
of the late-game comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	Or will we?  
</P>
<P>
	The lure of possibly winning a second straight Super Bowl proved  
so irresistible to John Elway that he put off his retirement plans 
after last year's victory. 
</P>
<P>
	If he wins championship No. 2 Sunday, he'll face the tantalizing  
prospect of a three-peat, even though those close to him believe he 
probably will leave the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'd always love to go out as a winner, to have your last  
game be the Super Bowl and be able to play well,'' the Denver 
Broncos quarterback said. ``That would be great. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then, again, no one's ever done it three times in a row. If we  
get a win here, it would throw a little kink into my thinking. It 
would give me something to think about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's the competitor in Elway speaking, not the realist.  
</P>
<P>
	Crawling painfully out of bed most mornings, requiring massages  
to relieve enough of the soreness to be able to practice -- that has 
been Elway's life for the past few seasons as his body has begun to 
betray him. 
</P>
<P>
	He can still escape a sack, but without the nimbleness he once  
had. He can still scramble for a first down, but without the 
halfback speed he once displayed. Only his fastball remains hard 
and true. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I can still play,'' the 38-year-old Elway said. ``I'm  
not the scrambler and I can't run around and do those types of 
things that I used to. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I think that mentally I'm a lot better now. And I think  
I'm throwing the football probably better than I ever have. I don't 
think I've lost any arm strength. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't make the big plays, but I think I'm probably a better  
quarterback. So the diminished physical skills, I don't think those 
are a big enough factor to make me retire. The talent we have on 
this team, that makes up for a lot of my weaknesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weaknesses?  
</P>
<P>
	For most of his career, there were no weaknesses, except for his  
impetuousness and impatience, qualities that frustrated his first 
coach, Dan Reeves, but made him a daring gunslinger and darling of 
Denver fans. 
</P>
<P>
	But quarterbacks can't play forever, not even 45-year-old Steve  
DeBerg, the Atlanta Falcons backup. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway recognizes that he probably would have been gone from the  
game by now if not for running back Terrell Davis, who has helped 
prolong his career. No longer required to carry his team as he did 
through the 1980s and early '90s, Elway made a bold, once 
unthinkable admission this season. ``My job is to hand off to 
Terrell now,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He does it well, while still retaining some of his flamboyance.  
Elway had the best passer rating of his career this season (93.0), 
and he engineered two more game-saving drives, raising his 
NFL-record total to 47. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined Dan Marino as the only NFL players with 50,000 yards  
passing, and he threw his 300th touchdown pass. Most important, for 
someone who is unimpressed by statistics, he remained the 
winningest quarterback in NFL history with 148 victories. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also missed all or parts of six games this season with  
hamstring, back and rib injuries, another concession to the ravages 
of time. 
</P>
<P>
	He has hedged on his statement last summer that he was 99.9  
percent certain this would be his last season. But Elway gave a 
hint of his intentions when, at the urging of coach Mike Shanahan, 
he took an uncharacteristic tour of Mile High Stadium after the AFC 
championship victory two weeks ago, holding the trophy aloft to his 
fans and saying, ``I love you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond that telling gesture, his coaches and teammates insist he  
has given them few clues about his pending decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't know,'' tight end Shannon Sharpe said. ``But I  
do know this: John would rather go out knowing that he had one more 
year left than stay and know that he should have left. It's going 
to be his decision, but obviously the guy can still play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway has said his mind has been on football and he won't make a  
decision about his future until after the season, when he has time 
to discuss the matter with his family, friends and coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is what I came back for, to get in this position to play  
for another championship,'' he said. ``I don't want to take the 
focus off what we're doing to prepare for this game. I'm going to 
enjoy this now and cross that bridge when the season's over. I've 
got plenty of time to make that decision in the offseason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ultimate decision might be his alone this year. Elway  
admitted that he, his wife and four children voted last year on 
whether he should return for the 1998 season. The vote was 5-1, 
with his being the only dissenting vote, so he yielded to the 
majority. He might ignore a similar mandate this time. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan has tried to prepare for the worst.  
</P>
<P>
	``Chances are, this will be John's last game,'' he said.  
``That's my gut feeling. But you never know, he could come back. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he does retire, we're going to miss him dearly.''

 *Vernon Berg 3d, gay ensign who challenged Navy discharge, dies at  
47 
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Vernon Berg 3d, an artist who was one of the  
first officers to stand up to the military after he was discharged 
for being homosexual, died Wednesday of complications from AIDS. He 
was 47. 
</P>
<P>
	Berg was given an ``other than honorable'' discharge from the  
Navy as an ensign in 1976 after an investigation revealed he was in 
a gay relationship. He sued, and the armed forces later adopted a 
policy of generally granting honorable discharges to homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1978, a federal appeals court ruled Berg and another officer  
were unfairly discharged, but didn't reinstate them. His discharge 
was upgraded to honorable as a result of the legal action. 
</P>
<P>
	Berg, a graduate of the Naval Academy at Annapolis, went on to  
become a prolific artist who documented life with AIDS in 
sculptures, paintings, photographs and cartoonlike drawings.

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Chicago To Block Homeless Haven </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- In New York, the homeless hide out in the warmth  
and dark of train tunnels. In San Francisco, it's the narrow alleys 
of the drug-ridden Tenderloin. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the days of the Depression, Chicago's home for the  
homeless has been Lower Wacker Drive, part of a network of dank, 
cavernous roadways that lies just 30 feet beneath some of city's 
ritziest shops and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	But that's about to change, if some Chicago building owners have  
their way. They now have permission to lock newly constructed gates 
that block off concrete loading docks and heating grates. 
</P>
<P>
	``We come across looking like brutes, but really no one is doing  
anyone any service by encouraging them to live on Lower Wacker 
Drive,'' said John Camper, a spokesman for Mayor Richard Daley. 
``We treat the poor and the homeless as well as we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, many in the underground wondered where they would go.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of unfair, kicking us out of here. But if that's  
what the government wants, I'll do what they want,'' said James 
Marion, who has lived on Lower Wacker since he was released from a 
veterans hospital eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll just pack up my blankets and what I can carry,'' he said  
Friday. ``A toothbrush, mouthwash, cologne.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About three blocks away, Tony Evans descended from the sunshine  
to look for a friend he wanted to warn that police could arrest 
anyone who ignores the 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearby, piles of ratty blankets and a stray office chair  
surrounded a cardboard box that contained foam plates, orange peels 
and leftover rice. Pigeons pecked at a few scattered bread crumbs 
on the urine-tinged concrete. 
</P>
<P>
	``Me myself, I got a rough situation,'' said Evans, who moved  
from Lower Wacker to live with a friend in the Cabrini-Green 
housing project seven months ago. ``But it's worse for these guys. 
They don't have nowhere to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new rules aren't exactly boosting Chicago's already shaky  
image when it comes to compassion for the poor. This is the same 
city accused of shuttling the homeless to sites unseen during big 
events, including the Democratic National Convention in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all in an effort to try to hide the problem of  
homelessness,'' said Daniel Tardiff of the Chicago Coalition for 
the Homeless. ``It's happening all over the country. They're trying 
to make the issue faceless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tardiff's group would like the Building Owners and Managers  
Association of Chicago to donate $80,000 to create a fund to pay 
three months rent and help those displaced by the new rules get 
back on their feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Colgan, a spokesman for the association, said building  
owners and managers ``feel bad about the situation. But on the 
other side, we've got to gain control of the access to the 
buildings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates for the poor question how many of the city's 5,424  
shelter beds are available on any given night -- and whether people 
who've lived on Lower Wacker would even stay there if they were 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	``They choose to live down there because they don't want anyone  
to tell them `Cut your hair and get a job,' so to speak,'' said 
Sister Connie Driscoll, who heads the St. Martin dePorres shelter 
and sits on the city's homeless task force. 
</P>
<P>
	Studs Terkel, the author and Chicago historian, said Lower  
Wacker should remain the haven it's always been. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it weren't for the warm grates we would've had 80 frozen  
corpses down there during the big blizzard,'' said Terkel, who was 
among about 300 who attended a rally opposing the lockout Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not too hard to become homeless. One or two bad breaks, a  
serious illness -- bang -- suddenly you're homeless.''

<HEADLINE> Blue Jays May Amend Quantrill Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Paul Quantrill's broken  
leg could cost him more than pain and frustration. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Jays have proposed tearing up his existing $1.4 million  
contract and substituting it with a less-costly, performance-based 
pay package for the 1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, they're giving the right-handed reliever the  
opportunity to extend the contract for one or two more years. 
</P>
<P>
	``How we want to view this is, `You can't play because of  
something you did, therefore let's work out this where we continue 
to pay something, you give up something, and by the way, let's talk 
about taking this into the future,''' Toronto general manager Gord 
Ash said. 
</P>
<P>
	Quantrill broke his right leg in a snowmobiling accident near  
his Toronto-area home in early January. 
</P>
<P>
	Because snowmobiling falls into ``risky activity'' territory,  
the Blue Jays are within their rights to void his contract in 
exchange for 30 days' pay, about $235,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's trying to do what's best for everybody else,''  
said Ron Shapiro, Quantrill's agent. ``There's absolutely no anger 
at all. There's a great relationship between the club and the 
player. They've made a proposal and we're in the process of 
studying it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quantrill hopes to be pitching by the end of May. He was 3-4  
with seven saves and a 2.59 ERA in 82 games last season.

<P>
	Concerns about how to pull Russia and Asia out of the crisis, as  
well as Brazil's economic troubles, have topped the meeting's 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	``The critical factor -- whether in countries responding to  
crisis or in countries working to avoid crisis -- is political 
will,'' Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials in Davos, including Rubin and Vice President Al  
Gore, have increased pressure on Japan, which remains a major 
concern because of the impact its struggling economy continues to 
have on the rest of Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore's Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew said his country can  
recover from economic crisis without Japan, but things would go 
faster for Singapore and the region if there is a Japanese 
turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
	``Japan now has to be as creative and inventive as the Americans  
and the Europeans,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa said quick action was  
needed to revive Asia before its economic malaise spreads to more 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the lights are switched out in Asia, the impact on the  
global economy will be really unthinkable,'' Tung said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin dismissed the idea that an early warning system should be  
established to warn of impending financial crisis, saying he could 
see no method of prediction that would be reliable enough to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``In addition, the early warning itself could create precisely  
the instability and even panic that such a system is designed to 
prevent,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He contrasted the growing U.S. trade deficit with European and  
Japanese surpluses, saying the world economy ``cannot sustain 
indefinitely the large imbalances created by the disparities in 
growth and openness between the United States and its major 
industrial trading partners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A day after the lower house of Russia's parliament approved the  
draft 1999 budget, Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov is to 
take part in a forum on ways out of Russia's economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	The advent of Europe's single currency also has attracted  
attention. German central bank president Hans Tietmeyer called for 
flexibility within Europe to help make the euro ``a lasting 
success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Helmut Maucher, chairman of international food and drink giant  
Nestle, said the financial criteria set up for countries to enter 
the European monetary union had placed pressure on governments such 
as Germany to reduce social spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is good for Europe and it's good for the consumer,''  
Maucher said.

<HEADLINE> NBA '99: It's Wide Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Welcome to the post-lockout, post-Jordan NBA. February is nearly  
here, every team is undefeated and every game will count a little 
more. 
</P>
<P>
	Scottie is with Charles, Spree is free and the Bulls stink.  
</P>
<P>
	Put it all together and it might be enough to get the fans  
interested again. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to put on a good show from the start, I think,''  
Lakers coach Del Harris said. ``Why? Because each game's going to 
be very important in a compacted season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 50-game schedule begins Friday, Feb. 5, more than three  
months late and 32 games short. So much will have changed from that 
night in mid-June when Michael Jordan stole the ball from Karl 
Malone and hit the shot that gave the Chicago Bulls their sixth 
title of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
	There won't be an encore this year, not from Jordan and not from  
the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	That dynasty is dead.  
</P>
<P>
	For the other 28 teams, it means the race for the championship  
is wide open. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can see why people would be excited about it, but I wish he  
was still playing. He was everything that was right about the 
NBA,'' Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy said, referring to Jordan's 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's obviously great for the fans, but also for the other  
players because he's such a benchmark as far as work, dedication 
and commitment to winning, and I wonder where that's going to come 
from now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It'll take years for someone to step into Jordan's sneakers, but  
the process will nonetheless begin immediately in this abbreviated 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks have become a serious contender with Latrell  
Sprewell, traded from Golden State, where he was suspended for 68 
games and lost about $6 million in salary for choking coach P.J. 
Carlesimo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indiana Pacers were already a major contender, and now  
they're being labeled the favorites in the East. They return almost 
the exact team that took the Bulls to seven games in the conference 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers, however, are old. And one of the popular lines of  
thinking these days if that the younger teams -- such as Boston, 
Cleveland and Portland -- will have an advantage this season with so 
many games crammed into so few nights -- 50 games in 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard that theory, but you just don't know because all of  
this is so new to everyone,'' Pacers coach Larry Bird said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the oddities of the revamped schedule is that teams will  
play three games on three consecutive nights three times during the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Bird used to do it with the Celtics, playing Friday night,  
Saturday night and Sunday afternoon, but none of today's players 
are used to that kind of grind. 
</P>
<P>
	The new generation also isn't used to playing 88 percent of its  
games within the same conference, but they'll have to adjust to 
that, too, as teams play out of conference only six times all 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, there won't be an All-Star break. That weekend of  
frivolity was lost because of the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	``With 50 games, it's kind of like college,'' Detroit's Grant  
Hill said. ``If the No. 1 team loses a game, it will be like they 
slipped in the standings. You sure don't want to start out much 
below .500. If you fall far off, you'll have a hard time catching 
up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players reported to training camps in varying degrees of shape,  
with Shawn Kemp and Patrick Ewing among the most obviously 
overweight. 
</P>
<P>
	A few teams practiced together regularly during the 6 1/2-month  
lockout, including the Pacers and Utah Jazz, while other teams came 
out of the work stoppage with only three or four players under 
contract, including Phoenix, Orlando and Atlanta, and then had to 
scramble just to put a roster together. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time some of those teams get comfortable, 10 games -- or  
one-fifth of the season -- might have passed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important to get off to a good start, and it's important  
to have depth and be able to overcome the attrition that happens 
when you play a lot of games in a short period of time,'' Seattle 
coach Paul Westphal said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the West, the Jazz still look like the team to beat.  
</P>
<P>
	Having been to the finals the last two years only to lose to the  
Bulls, Utah returns virtually the same team that won 126 
regular-season games in those two seasons. The Jazz also 
embarrassed the Lakers in the Western Conference finals last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a lot of things that went wrong. That's why we got  
swept,'' Kobe Bryant said. ``Obviously, Utah's the team to beat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the competition has gotten tougher, from Scottie Pippen  
joining Charles Barkley and Hakeem Olajuwon in Houston to Steve 
Kerr and Mario Elie joining the San Antonio Spurs and their 
formidable big men, David Robinson and Tim Duncan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Houston's loaded, Pippen's won six titles, he knows what it  
takes,'' Bryant said. ``San Antonio has big bodies. There are some 
tough teams. We have a tough team, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One team that won't be tough is Chicago, although it might be  
tough to watch. 
</P>
<P>
	The only returning players from last year's playoff team are  
Toni Kukoc, Ron Harper, Bill Wennington and Randy Brown. The rest 
of them were sent packing by Chicago owner Jerry Reinsdorf and 
general manager Jerry Krause, who didn't want their team to suffer 
through several years of post-championship doldrums the way the 
Boston Celtics did in the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	What they've done, however, is turned the Bulls into a  
laughingstock -- at least for now. Chicago will sacrifice this 
season before reloading in the free-agent market next summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody is going to feel sorry for the Bulls,'' Detroit coach  
Alvin Gentry said. ``And (new coach) Tim Floyd is a great friend of 
mine. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happened in Chicago is no different than what happened  
here in the years after 1989 and 1990. The only difference is that, 
for them, it happened in two days. Here, it happened over a matter 
of years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's exit makes the road easier for the Knicks, Pacers and  
Miami Heat, as well as the next rung of Eastern Conference 
contenders -- New Jersey, Atlanta, Milwaukee and Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	It also will keep a team from the West, whether it's Utah,  
Houston, the Lakers, Sonics or Suns, from facing the ultimate 
competitor in the championship round. 
</P>
<P>
	But then again, what if ...  
</P>
<P>
	``You can't rely on his retirement,'' Van Gundy said, ``because  
what if he comes back again this year?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan left the door slightly open by saying he was 99.9 percent  
retired. 
</P>
<P>
	But he wouldn't really come back this season, would he?  
</P>
<P>
	``I can't see why he would now,'' Van Gundy said, ``but maybe.''

<HEADLINE> IOC: From Corruption to Drug Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Still caught up in a widening  
corruption scandal, the International Olympic Committee now has to 
deal with another ethical issue that is potentially just as 
damaging: drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	With the bribery crisis unfolding, the IOC finds itself in the  
tricky position of staging a world summit next week against the 
escalating use of performance-enhancing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The timing couldn't have been worse.  
</P>
<P>
	Does the IOC -- and its embattled president, Juan Antonio  
Samaranch -- have the ethical authority to lead a crusade against 
drugs when the committee's own standards are under attack in the 
biggest corruption scandal in Olympic history? 
</P>
<P>
	Barry McCaffrey, the White House drug czar who is part of the  
U.S. delegation to the conference, has his doubts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly the (IOC) is in serious disruption now,'' he said in  
Washington this week. ``It's hard to imagine how this issue can be 
moved forward if the institution lacks legitimacy to address the 
problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IOC officials say they informally discussed whether to postpone  
the conference as a result of the vote-buying scandals that started 
with Salt Lake City's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games and 
have since spread to other cities. 
</P>
<P>
	But the doping meeting was announced months ago, and with some  
500 delegates due to attend, it was decided not to cancel. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC completed its investigation into the Salt Lake City  
scandal last weekend -- including the ouster of six members -- in 
hopes of clearing the way for the drug summit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was necessary to try to clean the house before the  
conference,'' Samaranch told The Associated Press. ``There are many 
ministers, many people, very important organizations coming here. 
It would be a disaster to postpone it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IOC executive board member Kevan Gosper said he doesn't think  
the conference will be eclipsed or overshadowed by the corruption 
scandals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been difficult to go into the conference on the  
moral high ground if we'd been less than diligent on the Salt Lake 
inquiry,'' he said. ``It was important to show we were putting our 
house in order.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been a wrong move to postpone the conference,''  
he said. ``It would have demonstrated a weakness on our part.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The World Conference on Doping in Sport, which runs Tuesday  
through Thursday at the Beaulieu Palace in Lausanne, was called in 
the wake of an unprecedented spate of drug cases in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	The main catalyst for the meeting was the doping scandals that  
decimated the Tour de France cycling race in July. A series of 
arrests, police raids and confessions exposed the widespread, 
systematic use of drugs, notably the banned endurance-boosting 
hormone erythropoietin -- EPO. 
</P>
<P>
	There were other prominent cases:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Irish swimmer Michele Smith de Bruin, winner of three gold  
medals at the 1996 Atlanta Games, was banned for four years after 
being found guilty of tampering with her urine samples. She's 
appealing. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Tennis star Petr Korda tested positive for steroids at  
Wimbledon, only to escape without a suspension due to ``exceptional 
circumstances.'' Tennis officials are now trying to get him banned 
for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A Chinese woman swimmer was suspended for four years after  
carrying banned drugs in her luggage to the world championships in 
Australia; four other Chinese swimmers got two-year bans for using 
banned substances. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Sprinter Dennis Mitchell, Olympic champion shot putter Randy  
Barnes and three-time Boston Marathon champion Uta Pippig all 
failed drug tests. Mitchell was later cleared by USA Track and 
Field, while Barnes and Pippig are appealing. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC, which introduced drug tests at the 1968 Olympics,  
acknowledges that the problem is only getting worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thirty years later, it has unfortunately become clear that ...  
doping is spreading at a terrifying rate,'' the IOC said in 
conference documents. 
</P>
<P>
	The main goals of the meeting are come up with an ironclad  
definition of doping, agree on a single medical code and list of 
banned substances, unify drug rules and sanctions, set up a world 
anti-doping agency and enlist the support of governments and law 
enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC will be under pressure to make sure the conference  
amounts to more than a chat room and produces concrete action 
rather than cosmetic gestures. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC must not shy away from its responsibility to provide  
leadership and direction on this matter to safeguard the integrity 
of sport and generations of future athletes,'' the British Olympic 
Association said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest challenge has been to try to get all sports  
federations to abide by the same policy. 
</P>
<P>
	All Olympic federations -- except for three -- adopted a  
resolution in November calling for a minimum two-year ban for use 
of steroids and other major drugs. A second offense would result in 
a life ban. 
</P>
<P>
	The world bodies of soccer, tennis and cycling all expressed  
reservations. 
</P>
<P>
	FIFA, the soccer federation, says it will never accept a  
two-year ban. Cycling says the sanction will never stand up in 
court. And tennis has been ridiculed for allowing Korda to escape 
without suspension on grounds that he didn't know how the banned 
drug got into his system. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the terms of the November agreement, sports that don't  
comply risk being dropped from the Olympics. But the IOC has shown 
no signs that it will carry out the threat. 
</P>
<P>
	The Olympics' drug chief proposed a major compromise this week.  
</P>
<P>
	Prince Alexandre de Merode, the IOC medical commission chairman,  
called for ``selective'' bans under which athletes would be barred 
from major competitions but allowed to take part in minor events. 
</P>
<P>
	De Merode's plan would allow athletes to continue to make a  
living while serving drug suspensions. This would help bring 
sanctions into line with European right-to-work laws. 
</P>
<P>
	But the move could also be interpreted as a sign of weakness at  
a time when many are calling on the IOC to take hard-line measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Another key issue is the need to find reliable tests for EPO,  
human growth hormone and other synthetic forms of naturally 
occurring substances. These have become the drugs of choice in 
sports because they can't be detected by current testing methods. 
</P>
<P>
	Sports officials are calling for additional funding and research  
to develop new tests. The possibility of blood tests is also being 
explored. 
</P>
<P>
	The conference is expected to approve the creation of an agency  
that will coordinate the anti-doping fight around the world, 
including a comprehensive, out-of-competition testing program. 
Whether the agency will be under the aegis of the IOC or fully 
independent remains uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials, meanwhile, plan to use the conference to renew  
their call for duplicate medals to be awarded to Olympic athletes 
who lost to East German competitors using drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, the IOC turned down U.S. and British requests for  
medals for swimmers beaten by East Germans at the 1976 and 1980 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said it was impossible to rewrite the record books,  
despite court evidence in Germany that East German athletes were 
helped by steroids.

<HEADLINE> Lawrence Taylor Makes Hall of Fame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Lawrence Taylor was right. His election to the Pro  
Football Hall of Fame really was a no-brainer. 
</P>
<P>
	The troubled linebacker was a first-ballot choice today, voted  
into the Canton, Ohio, shrine along with Eric Dickerson, Tom Mack, 
Ozzie Newsome and old-timer Billy Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
	Induction ceremonies are scheduled for Aug. 7.  
</P>
<P>
	Taylor's candidacy was a topic of controversy throughout Super  
Bowl week. He was suspended once and arrested twice on drug 
charges, was found guilty of filing false income tax returns and 
was questioned by a grand jury investigating organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
	All of those things weighed against him in minds of some of the  
36 writers on the voting panel, even though, unlike baseball, there 
are no ``good citizenship'' requirements in the bylaws of 
football's hall. It prompted a longer-than-usual debate by the 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
	When he learned of his induction, Taylor said he was humbled by  
the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like it is the ultimate reward for playing the game I  
love so much and gave so much,'' he said. ``I appreciate the debate 
and the consideration that was given to my nomination. Ultimately, 
this honor has to do with how I played the game. Obviously, the 
majority of the committee felt the same way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, Taylor offered no apologies for his checkered  
past. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't apologize for anything,'' Taylor said. ``There are  
some things in all our lives we wish we could change. 
Unfortunately, we can't do that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't worry about the choices I made. When my days are over  
I'll have to answer for everything I've done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor had the endorsement of NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Hall is about performance on the field,'' Tagliabue said  
Friday. ``Lawrence was one of the greatest players ever; he changed 
the way the game is played. I think the public understands that by 
making a judgment on what he did on the field, you're not judging 
what he did off it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, star linebacker for the New York Giants from 1981-93,  
was the dominant defensive player of his time. A three-time choice 
as Defensive Player of the Year, he was the NFL's most valuable 
player in 1986 and was selected for a record 10 consecutive Pro 
Bowls. He finished his career with 132.5 sacks, not including 9.5 
recorded in 1981 before sacks became and official statistic. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor needed support from 80 percent of the voters present.  
Final votes were not announced. 
</P>
<P>
	The list of 15 candidates was first reduced to seven finalists.  
Of those seven, only Pittsburgh Steelers receiver Lynn Swann and 
Oakland Raiders defensive lineman Howie Long were not elected. 
</P>
<P>
	Others eliminated early in the process were coaches George Allen  
and Marv Levy, Pittsburgh Steelers owner Dan Rooney, defensive end 
Carl Eller, punter Ray Guy, wide receiver John Stallworth, tackle 
Ron Yary and defensive end Jack Youngblood. 
</P>
<P>
	Dickerson, who ran for a record 2,105 yards in 1984 wound up  
third on the career rushing list with 13,259. 
</P>
<P>
	Dickerson said that while many consider his record rushing  
season his greatest accomplishment, he is prouder of his 1,808 
yards as a rookie. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I look back on it, you get one shot to get that rookie  
record,'' he said. ``I came in as an unproven player in my first 
year and did that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mack was an 11-time Pro Bowl choice when he played for the Los  
Angeles Rams and one of the best blocking guards of his generation. 
He played in 184 consecutive games, never missing a game in his 
13-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's truly exciting to literally feel like you're going back  
home,'' said Mack, who was born in Cleveland, about an hour away 
from Canton. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the last year of candidacy for Mack, who thought his  
eligibility expired last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsome, tops all tight ends in receptions with 662 catches for  
7,980 yards and 47 touchdowns in 13 seasons with the Cleveland 
Browns. He had back-to-back 89-catch seasons in 1983 and 1984 and 
played in 197 consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsome was elected after reaching the finals three times and  
missing each of those years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The longer it takes to get in, the more you appreciate it,''  
he said. ``Last year, getting into the final six or seven, that 
last hour was a real tough wait.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw, a guard, played nine seasons with the Buffalo Bills and  
made pro football's All-Decade team of the '60s and the all-time 
AFL team.

<HEADLINE> Family Affair at Falcons Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The Atlanta Falcons' final Super Bowl workout was  
more like a family outing Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Dan Reeves allowed the players to bring their family  
members to Pro Player Stadium for the 30-minute walk-through, which 
was conducted basically in street clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves could not remember if he allowed family members to attend  
the walk-through prior to his three Super Bowls as coach of the 
Denver Broncos. But he said it was a good chance for them to see 
the stadium before ``it gets crowded on Sunday.'' Picture taking 
was at a premium. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just touched on some last-minute details,'' Reeves said.  
``You can't get everything covered. So usually on Saturdays, we try 
to cover some things we might not have hit during the week against 
certain defenses or certain formations. So really, not any warming 
up or anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons also tested the turf at Pro Player, having the  
practice squad players wear cleated shoes during the workout. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seemed to hold up real well,'' Reeves said. ``The field is  
in great shape, but what you don't know is when they are going full 
speed and start cutting and so forth, what it will look like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons are close to full strength. Defensive end Lester  
Archambeau and tight end-fullback Brian Kozlowski both practiced 
the rest of the week after missing Monday's workout. Also, 
receiver-returner Tim Dwight has recovered from a stomach virus and 
should be ready for Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves said he altered the routine from previous Super Bowls,  
devoting most of the practice time to Atlanta's own game plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had never done that before because I didn't want to get them  
thinking about the opponent too much,'' he said. ``I think that has 
worked out well, because we seem to be a lot more comfortable in 
what we're doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons took the remainder of the day off. Unlike most  
previous teams in the Super Bowl, they were not planning to change 
hotels the night before the game.

<HEADLINE> Gretzky Aggravates Rib Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Wayne Gretzky aggravated a strained rib cage that  
has been bothering him recently during the New York Rangers' 3-2 
victory Saturday night over the Detroit Red Wings. But both Gretzky 
and Rangers coach John Muckler hope it won't cause him to miss any 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky left the ice in pain during the third period and didn't  
return. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got to the point where I wasn't feeling good and it was best  
to stop it right there,'' said Gretzky, who wasn't sure after the 
game if he'll be able to play Monday night against Washington at 
Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not concerned about it right now,'' Gretzky added. ``I'll  
see how it feels the next couple of days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky had a second-period assist during the Rangers' first win  
at Detroit in almost seven years. He played 16 shifts totaling 
13:24. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL's all-time goals and scoring leader, who turned 38 last  
week, has seven goals and 40 assists this season. Last Sunday he 
had a goal and two assists en route to most valuable player honors 
in North America's 8-6 victory over the World team at the NHL 
All-Star Game at Tampa.

<HEADLINE> 5 Teens Die in Pennsylvania Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LIMA, Pa. (AP) -- Five teen-age girls returning from a shopping  
trip died after their car veered off the road, flipped over and 
crashed into a tree, state police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The girls were all juniors at Penncrest High School in Marple  
Township, which planned to make 30 counselors available today to 
grieving students, parents and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	The car crossed a median strip about 15 miles west of  
Philadelphia, swerved back into the northbound lanes and hit a dirt 
embankment. It then rolled on its side and crashed into a tree, 
according to a state police report. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear why the car went out of control, but  
investigators said it was likely that the car was speeding. 
</P>
<P>
	``Were they going faster than 55? It's a pretty good guess to  
say yes,'' said trooper Joseph McCunney. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims were identified as Loren Wells, 16, the driver of  
the car; Shaena Grigaitis, 16; Rachel Lehr, 17; Becky Weirich, 16; 
and Tracy Graham, 17.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Postpones Latin America Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky arrived back in Washington on  
Saturday in preparation for deposition testimony in President 
Clinton's impeachment trial, while Clinton rescheduled a February 
trip to Central America so he would be home when the case ends. 
</P>
<P>
	Subpoenaed by the Senate to testify on Monday, Ms. Lewinsky was  
greeted at the Mayflower Hotel by several dozen tourists and 
anti-Clinton demonstrators, held behind red velvet ropes as she 
walked past wearing a black topcoat and baseball cap. 
</P>
<P>
	``God bless the dress,'' one protest sign read, referring to the  
stained clothing of Ms. Lewinsky that had evidence of a sexual 
relationship between the president and the former White House 
intern. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky's closed testimony is scheduled to be conducted  
Monday in the stately hotel, where she will be questioned by House 
prosecutors and White House lawyers, with two senators serving as 
referees. The Senate would have to decide whether to release a 
videotape of her testimony or to call her as a live witness. Three 
House prosecutors interviewed her at the hotel last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton rescheduled his long-planned Feb. 10-15 trip after the  
Senate set a goal of voting on two articles of impeachment by Feb. 
12. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the president and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton  
will make a day trip to Mexico on Feb. 15 to meet with President 
Ernesto Zedillo. Clinton and his wife then will tour Honduras, El 
Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala March 8-11 to assess the recovery 
from Hurricane Mitch and participate in a summit of Central 
American leaders, the White House announced Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a Newsweek poll released Saturday said 65 percent of  
Americans -- and even 45 percent of Republicans surveyed -- believe 
that Clinton should not be indicted after leaving office for the 
actions that led to his impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 28 percent responded that Clinton should be convicted in  
the impeachment trial and removed from office. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of those surveyed, 54 percent, said Republicans  
have been hurt by the impeachment proceedings, and 40 percent of 
Republicans agreed with that assessment. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll interviewed 751 adults from Jan. 28-29, with a margin  
of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> 5 Teens Charged in Athlete's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Five youths were charged Saturday with stabbing  
a 14-year old boy to death following a basketball game in a 
neighborhood youth program that rewards academic achievement with 
athletics. 
</P>
<P>
	Yasser Ashburn, 15, was charged with two counts of second-degree  
murder for allegedly stabbing Michael Bennett twice. Derek Loper, 
16, Dave Forrest, 18, Andre Mitchell, 16, and Izzy Hill, 15, faced 
manslaughter and various other charges.

<HEADLINE> State: Man Stole To Finance Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- David Alan Scott was a trusted guardian of  
state child support records, a churchgoing husband and a father of 
two children. 
</P>
<P>
	According to prosecutors, the 36-year-old accountant also was an  
embezzler who used the state's money to finance breast implants for 
a stripper he met through an escort service, and a fur coat and car 
for another lover. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott pleaded innocent Friday to charges of pilfering at least  
$680,000 from the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration 
-- the biggest government embezzlement case in state history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still can't believe it,'' said Faye Peavler, who lives next  
door to the Scotts. ``He called me up to the fence one day and told 
me he found the Lord, and I told him I was proud of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peavler said Scott was a caring, friendly neighbor who offered  
his phone number if she ever needed his help. The two often talked. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a court affidavit, prosecutors portrayed an accountant  
who exploited his trusted status to carry on a second, secret life. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott was one of only three agency employees with full access to  
computerized records of about 300,000 active child support cases. 
Investigators say he created phony child support accounts, used 
them to pay his lovers and then erased the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	He was charged Wednesday with five counts of forgery and one  
count each of corrupt business influence, theft, computer tampering 
and official misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott earned $26,287 a year and had been promoted five times in  
his 13 years at Family and Social Services. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a well-trusted employee,'' said Andrew Stoner, a  
spokesman for the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the missing money went to the women with whom Scott had  
affairs, according to an affidavit filed by prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott approached Brenda Mayfield, a former agency employee with  
whom he was having an affair, in 1991 and offered to inflate her 
child support payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, she received more than $236,000, some of which  
she shared with Scott, the affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged theft accelerated in 1997 when Scott met Gina  
Calabris through an escort agency and developed a sexual 
relationship with her that lasted through April 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	During that time, the affidavit says, Scott began giving  
Calabris child support checks and money from his bank account or 
from credit-card cash advances. 
</P>
<P>
	As debts began to mount and his trust in Calabris waned, Scott  
began issuing child support checks to himself, according to court 
records. One of those checks was allegedly used to buy breast 
implants for Calabris in September 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Calabris showed the receipt from the clinic to investigators  
shortly after Scott allegedly told her he would not give her more 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really sorry for everything that's happened,'' said  
Calabris, 29, before pleading innocent at her first court 
appearance Friday on theft and forgery charges.

<HEADLINE> Minimum Tax May Be Changed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is proposing a  
two-year reprieve for millions of middle-class people who might 
otherwise face unexpectedly higher tax bills simply because they 
took advantage of new education or child tax credits. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal would ensure that people of modest incomes who use  
such credits are not unwittingly subject to the alternative minimum 
tax -- a complex tax created to prevent the wealthy from sheltering 
too much income. 
</P>
<P>
	Since many tax credits now benefit middle class taxpayers, they  
can conceivably lower tax bills to nothing, which could in turn 
trigger the alternative minimum tax. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior administration official, speaking on condition of  
anonymity, said the measure excluding such credits from the minimum 
tax will be included in the fiscal 2000 budget President Clinton 
will unveil Monday. Total cost for the two-year measure is 
projected at $1.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was anticipated by tax analysts, particularly since  
Congress acted last fall to make sure people using the 
$400-per-child credit, Hope scholarship and lifetime learning 
credits to reduce their 1998 taxes were not penalized by the 
minimum tax. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be terribly embarrassing, because the people who were  
affected would not be appropriate,'' said Tom Ochsenslager, tax 
partner at the Grant Thornton accounting firm. ``If they are in 
(the alternative minimum tax) they're going to pay more, they'll be 
caught unawares and they'll owe penalties and interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The current exclusion applies only to the 1998 tax year. The  
Clinton administration would extend the exclusion for the 1999 and 
2000 tax years, according to the senior official. 
</P>
<P>
	It would also cover the administration's proposed new credits  
for such things as caring for disabled people and stay-at-home care 
of infants. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the exclusion, the administration estimated that the  
number of people affected by the minimum tax would rise from 1.5 
million in 1999 to 12 million by 2009. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Archer, chairman of the House Ways and Means  
Committee, noted that Republicans have sought to eliminate or 
reduce the alternative minimum tax, or AMT, which he said could 
particularly hurt families with several children. 
</P>
<P>
	``This shows once more that when politicians try to soak the  
rich with higher taxes, it's often the middle class that gets 
wet,'' said Archer, R-Texas. ``The AMT is a tax-hike time bomb.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are several disadvantages to the AMT, starting with its  
sheer complexity. The Internal Revenue Service estimates that it 
requires five hours to complete the form. 
</P>
<P>
	The AMT allows virtually no deductions for such things as state  
taxes. Although there is a $45,000 exemption for joint filers, AMT 
tax rates begin at 26 percent -- much higher than the 15 percent 
paid by many modest-income people. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from those details, many middle-class people probably  
would never know they could be required to pay the AMT. That means 
they'd get an unexpected notice from the IRS asking them for more 
money, plus penalties and interest, just because they took 
advantage of tax credits. 
</P>
<P>
	``A realistic concern would be that a person would not even  
realize they are subject to the tax,'' Ochsenslager said.

	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Miami guard Michael Simmons suffered a  
concussion while hitting his head on the floor during the first 
half of Saturday's Big East game against Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons was trying to steal the ball from Pitt guard Kellii  
Taylor just above the top of the key when the two became tangled. 
Simmons, who may have been accidentally struck by Taylor's elbow, 
was not able to break his fall as the right side of his head struck 
the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-1 freshman, from Rialto, Calif., lay motionless for  
several minutes while being attended to by physicians. He was taken 
to the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, but was released 
before the end of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons, who averages 3.4 points per game, did not score before  
being injured.

<HEADLINE> Robber Foiled by Own Cologne </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ABERDEEN, S.D. (AP) -- A would-be casino robber foiled by his own  
cologne has received seven years behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerold Nissen of Aberdeen wore a Halloween mask as he entered  
the casino Nov. 4 with a loaded gun, said Ken Varns, assistant 
Brown County state's attorney. When Nissen announced the robbery, a 
casino clerk recognized his cologne as that of a regular patron and 
addressed Nissen by name. 
</P>
<P>
	``She told him to take the mask off, that it wasn't funny,''  
Varns said. ``He put the gun away, took the mask off, sat down at a 
machine and played lottery for a few minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The robbery attempt was reported the next day, when casino  
officials noticed phone lines had been cut. A search of Nissen's 
truck turned up the mask, gun and wire clippers, Varns said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissen pleaded guilty to attempted robbery Friday in exchange  
for the seven-year sentence. The charge carries a maximum sentence 
of 12 1/2 years.

<HEADLINE> Once Praised, Welch Now Vilified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The words were uttered in praise in the  
intoxicating days before Salt Lake City was awarded the 2002 Winter 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every great cause needs someone who will go to the extremes  
that no one else will,'' Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt said of Tom Welch, 
the city's chief Olympic scout. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years later, Leavitt's words have haunting overtones.  
</P>
<P>
	For Welch, the man once lauded for doing whatever it took to win  
the Winter Games for his home state, the man who abandoned a 
corporate career and ultimately his marriage, is now vilified for 
having gone overboard, for having pandered to the greed of 
International Olympic Committee members. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt now tells a worldwide audience he is ``revolted'' by the  
unfolding scandal and accuses bid committee executives of a 
``systematic cover-up'' of behavior that was at odds with Utah's 
high moral standards. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC investigators say the bid committee gave $800,000 in cash  
and educational, medical and travel expenses to 14 IOC members as 
Salt Lake pursued the 2002 Games. The IOC picked the city on an 
unprecedented first ballot in June 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The finger-pointing has all the trappings of a witch hunt,  
grumbles Tom Schaffer, Welch's attorney. ``Tom now knows how the 
women of Salem must have felt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Welch's friends portray him as the scapegoat for a provincial  
state that long hungered for global acceptance and was willing to 
turn a blind eye to how the Olympic prize was obtained. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet even they concede the characteristics that once made Welch  
the go-to guy are those that now make it easy to cast him as the 
villain. 
</P>
<P>
	Raised in a lower-income family in Ogden, 35 miles north of Salt  
Lake, Welch, 54, was always energetic and affable. 
</P>
<P>
	Following his days as student-body president at Weber State in  
1968-69, he earned a law degree at George Washington Law School 
before returning to Utah to work his way into the corporate counsel 
job for Smith's Food &AMP; Drug. 
</P>
<P>
	The dream of Utah leaders of landing the Olympics had been  
dormant after three failed attempts dating to the 1960s. But the 
huge profit of the 1984 Los Angeles Summer Olympics reignited their 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
	That's when the charismatic Welch, whose reputation for  
high-energy salesmanship was renowned, offered his services to 
then-Mayor Ted Wilson and then-Gov. Norm Bangerter. In 1985, they 
asked him to take on Salt Lake's seemingly quixotic quest. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a long shot. We were used to losing up to that point,''  
Wilson recalls. ``As a bid guy, he was absolutely incredible. He 
was willing to get on those planes day in and day out. He was 
indefatigable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Welch and sidekick Dave Johnson, the senior vice president of  
the Salt Lake Organizing Committee who was forced to resign Jan. 8 
over his role in the bid effort, spent years traveling to Olympic 
meetings, pressing the case of the obscure, mountain-rimmed city at 
the edge of the Great Basin. 
</P>
<P>
	When the U.S. Olympic Committee in 1989 finally named Salt Lake  
its candidate for the 1998 Games and, if necessary, the 2002 Games, 
Welch promised Salt Lake would treat it as a ``sacred trust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Zuhl was on the bid committee in 1989, the year Welch left  
Smith's with millions from the company's first public stock 
offering and became a full-time Olympic volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch not only had the tenacity to elbow his way before a  
worldwide Olympic audience, he had the folksy charm to gain passage 
of a 1989 statewide referendum to use $59 million in sales tax 
revenue for games venues, Zuhl said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a passion for it and it was contagious to a lot of  
people,'' Zuhl recalled. ``He had one of those personalities that 
made you want to like him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But all the power, globetrotting and attention eventually went  
to his head, some friends believe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here's this Mormon boy from Ogden, Utah, who sort of came from  
out of the shadows,'' Zuhl said. ``Nobody knew who he was and 
suddenly he was a household name, cavorting with royalty from all 
over the world, traveling, an ambassador for the Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's pretty heady stuff. Unless you're pretty well grounded,  
it's easy to fall prey to whatever temptations there are in that 
circle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Welch's wife of 28 years, Alma, says he changed in the years  
before pushing Salt Lake into the winner's circle. 
</P>
<P>
	What had always been boyish enthusiasm -- for hunting, fishing,  
eating, politicking -- became an irritable, win-at-all-costs 
obsession that would brook no opposition, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alma Welch filed for divorce shortly after telling police that  
Welch tried to kill her in a struggle in their garage in July 1997. 
The former Mormon bishop pleaded no contest to a spousal abuse 
charge and went to a counselor, also resigning as SLOC's president. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple was divorced in October, although terms of the  
settlement are still being negotiated, and Welch plans a Feb. 5 
wedding to a widow in Huntington Beach, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Welch says she did not know about excessive spending on IOC  
members, but her husband ``never knew when enough was enough. There 
is no stopping valve on Tom. He cannot control himself. When he 
wants something, he gets it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Welch has often boasted of the role his wife and six children  
played, of how they hosted every visiting IOC member in their 
10,000-square-foot home in the foothills. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also left the family behind for weeks on end, and the two  
youngest, boys now 12 and 15, have suffered, Mrs. Welch says. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have grown up with a phantom sibling, more powerful than  
anyone in the family and that is the Olympics,'' Mrs. Welch said. 
``Tom was fully dedicated to the Olympics. It was superior to our 
marriage, to me and to the children individually.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Welch declined to be interviewed on the advice of his attorney.  
</P>
<P>
	But his friends say he remains convinced he was merely spending  
bid money to create friendships with IOC delegates and to be a 
generous member of the international sporting community. 
</P>
<P>
	``He feels hurt and wronged,'' attorney Bruce Baird said. ``It's  
hypocritical to tell somebody to go out and get in the game and 
then come back and say, `Well, you played the game too well.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Few of Welch's friends believe the governor and bid committee  
members were as ignorant of the lavish spending as they now claim. 
</P>
<P>
	Baird describes Welch's office during the bid period as looking  
like ``Santa's workshop at the North Pole the day before 
Christmas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody who claims they didn't know we were shipping out gifts  
to everybody is lying,'' Baird said. ``We sent the bid books out in 
gorgeous leather saddle bags.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Sydney Fonnesbeck, a former city council member and a  
friend of Welch's: ``What surprises me the most about the whole 
thing is how surprised everyone is. It wasn't done in secret.''

<HEADLINE> Shelley Long As Anguished Mother </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Shelley Long, forever known as the brainy but  
ditzy Diane Chambers of ``Cheers,'' has an anxiety-filled role she 
also takes to heart in the NBC television movie ``Vanished Without 
a Trace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Long, who happens to have a 13-year-old daughter, plays a  
suburban mother of three whose 14-year-old daughter goes 
adventuring with two friends one night and fails to return home. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie airing Monday (Feb. 1., 8-10 p.m., rated TV-14 for  
mature subject matter) also deals with Megan's Law requirements 
that neighborhood residents be notified if a sex offender is living 
among them. 
</P>
<P>
	The film features Billy Moses as the father and Julie Berman as  
the missing daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I read the script, I was really turning pages to find out  
what happens next,'' said Ms. Long. ``That's an important part of 
the story. It's not preachy, although it does give a message. It 
does remind us how vigilant we need to be with our teen-agers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``These are still very young girls. Not women. Not sophisticated  
in terms of dealing with any kind of seduction that might happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With ``Cheers'' apparently destined to play eternally in reruns,  
it's hard to associate Ms. Long with dramatic roles. She sets the 
record straight: 
</P>
<P>
	``I've actually done a lot of drama. When I started out in  
acting, drama was always in my mind. I was always very hammy and 
did my caricatures for my family. The plays I was interested in 
were mostly Tennessee Williams' -- and the movies I liked were 
dramas. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Long, who turns 50 in August, was born in Fort Wayne, Ind.,  
and studied drama at Northwestern University for two years. She 
then went on to Second City, the famed Chicago improv group, where 
``I realized what great, great fun comedy could be. Also what 
torture it could be if it didn't work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her work at Second City brought Hollywood offers, and she came  
west for a TV comedy-variety show. She made some guest appearances 
on sitcoms, but her first movie role was the dramatic ``A Small 
Circle of Friends'' (1980). She also appeared in a TV drama with 
Natalie Wood. But ``Cheers'' was the breakthrough and earned her an 
Emmy in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Her comic skills were more recently on display in ``The Brady  
Bunch Movie'' in 1995 and the sequel the following year. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the TV-14 rating for ``Vanished Without a Trace,'' Ms.  
Long hopes her own daughter will see the show. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be up to her,'' the actress remarked. ``I think it's  
appropriate for her to see it; I'd love to have lots of teen-agers 
see it. I think it has something valuable to say about what's going 
on for teens today.''

<HEADLINE> Big Jag Wins Palos Verdes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Big Jag overtook favorite Kona Gold in  
the final strides to win by a head Saturday in the $200,000 Palos 
Verdes Handicap at Santa Anita Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Jose Valdivia Jr. and carrying 116 pounds, Big Jag  
covered six furlongs in 1:08 and paid $8.40, $2.20 and $2.10. 
</P>
<P>
	Kona Gold, ridden by Alex Solis and carrying 121 pounds, paid  
$2.10 and $2.10. Swiss Yodeler, ridden by Chris McCarron, finished 
eight lengths behind the pair for third place and paid $2.10 to 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	Kona Gold was the favorite in the race after setting a Santa  
Anita track record of 1:01 3-5 for 5 1/2 furlongs in the Jan. 3 El 
Conejo Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got a heart as big as he is,'' said Tim Pinfield, Big  
Jag's trainer. ``The race set up for him. It was an honest pace. I 
didn't think Kona Gold was going to stop, and he didn't. We just 
stayed at him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone can now see that Big Jag might be the best sprinter  
around,'' said Valdivia. 
</P>
<P>
	The win, worth $120,000, increased Big Jag's career earnings to  
$462,215 with eight wins in 16 starts.

<HEADLINE> Falcons Super After Many Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Jessie Tuggle can remember Christmas Eve 1989 as if  
it were last week. 
</P>
<P>
	That's when the Atlanta Falcons lost to Barry Sanders and the  
Detroit Lions at Fulton County Stadium before only 5,000 fans, many 
of whom left early. 
</P>
<P>
	``It felt like a practice,'' the Falcons' middle linebacker  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I think of those people in the stands that day, THIS is  
for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuggle means the Super Bowl, of course, and Atlanta is in it, a  
stunning development for a team that had languished in obscurity 
for all of its 32 years and finished 3-13 two seasons ago, just as 
it did in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	The stars in Sunday's game are the defending champion Denver  
Broncos. They are led by John Elway, whose record fifth start at 
quarterback in a Super Bowl probably will mark the end of his 
16-year, Hall of Fame career. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway's counterpart fits the Falcons' supporting-cast image  
perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
	He's Chris Chandler, who has spent 11 seasons on six teams, all  
but one a loser. But he was brilliant in leading Atlanta to a 14-2 
regular-season record and two playoff victories. His quarterback 
rating of 100.9 was fourth in the NFL, almost eight points better 
than the fifth-ranked Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons love the contrast.  
</P>
<P>
	At the front of their Super Bowl news release is a page  
headlined: ``The Guys that Nobody Wanted are 16-2.'' It lists all 
the players who were cut or undrafted and the coaches who were 
fired by other teams, most prominently Dan Reeves, who spent 12 
years as coach of the Broncos and took them to three Super Bowls, 
all losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the examples of ``rejects'' are exaggerated.  
</P>
<P>
	They include Morten Andersen, one of the best kickers in NFL  
history, whom the Falcons grabbed when the New Orleans Saints cut 
him in a salary cap maneuver, and Jamal Anderson, a seventh-round 
draft choice in 1994, who ran for 1,846 yards this season. 
</P>
<P>
	So what? Anderson had two previous 1,000-yard seasons and his  
Denver counterpart, Terrell Davis, who ran for 2,008 yards and was 
the league's MVP, was a sixth-round pick in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	But the overall picture is accurate: Many Falcons are castoffs  
or players like Tuggle, an undrafted free agent who has made five 
Pro Bowls in 12 seasons but is not well known nationally because 
he's a Falcon. 
</P>
<P>
	They revel in the nickname ``Dirty Birds,'' which they got for  
the arm-flapping dance popularized by Anderson with help from tight 
end O.J. Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Dirty Birds are our image that's fine. We are Dirty  
Birds,'' said Reeves, who will coach the game only six weeks after 
quadruple heart bypass surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	With all that, the Falcons are underdogs by only a touchdown,  
fewer points than Green Bay was favored by last year against the 
Broncos. Denver, 11 1/2-point underdogs, won that game 31-24, breaking 
the NFC's 13-year winning streak and giving Elway his first Super 
Bowl ring after three losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The spread may be that small because the Falcons got here by  
beating Minnesota 30-27 in overtime at the Metrodome, where the 
15-1 Vikings had appeared unbeatable. Yes, Atlanta needed some 
luck, such as a missed field goal by the previously perfect Gary 
Anderson, but it also got brilliantly executed tying and winning 
drives from Chandler. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos, on the other hand, did just what they were expected  
to do. 
</P>
<P>
	They started 13-0 and needed only three more wins to match the  
1972 Miami Dolphins' perfect regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Then they lost two straight, to the New York Giants and  
Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	But they closed the regular season with a win over Seattle, got  
revenge against Miami with a 38-3 playoff win, then beat the New 
York Jets 23-10 in the AFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	The extra week off provided time for what a lot of people  
thought would be the theme of the Super Bowl: a 
``who-said-what-to-whom'' debate involving a dispute among Reeves, 
Elway and Broncos coach Mike Shanahan. 
</P>
<P>
	It was an old feud. Reeves fired Shanahan as his top assistant  
after the 1991 season and Denver owner Pat Bowlen fired Reeves a 
year later, reportedly at Elway's urging. 
</P>
<P>
	But that battle was fought in sound bites between Atlanta and  
Denver before the teams even got to Miami. By the time they arrived 
last Sunday, it already was old news. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's an awful lot of wounds. I caused some. They only heal  
with time,'' Reeves said. ``I apologize that I reopened some more 
wounds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan was more blunt, simply stating that he wouldn't talk  
about it any more. 
</P>
<P>
	So, most of the pregame blather revolved around the Falcons'  
humble origins. 
</P>
<P>
	True, before Atlanta's upset win at Minneapolis, the Super Bowl  
was expected to be a shootout between Minnesota and Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons lack the history and glamour of the 49ers, Cowboys  
and Packers, the NFC representatives for the past six seasons. But 
nobody -- except perhaps the TV networks -- thinks it's mandatory 
that San Francisco, Dallas or Green Bay be in every Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Television has to settle for Denver, which has been in five  
Super Bowls in the past 12 seasons, but has won only once. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos certainly seem to respect their opponents. Or at  
least they say so. 
</P>
<P>
	``Contrary to what everybody else thinks, I feel the two best  
teams are here,'' said Denver tight end Shannon Sharpe, sounding 
like just another football player, not the self-proclaimed best 
trash-talker in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``Top to bottom -- offense, defense, and special teams -- Atlanta  
was the best team in the NFC and that's why they're here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson was the NFL's second-leading running back, behind  
Davis. Chandler ranked ahead of Elway among quarterbacks and 
Atlanta's Tony Martin (17.9 yards per catch) and Terance Mathis 
(17.8) averaged more yards per catch than any Bronco. 
</P>
<P>
	Add the Falcons' plus-20 turnover ratio, best in the league, and  
you can make a legitimate case for an Atlanta victory. 
</P>
<P>
	If there are questions about the Falcons' legitimacy, it may be  
because of their division, the NFC West and about their ability to 
win outdoors. Their last nine games were in domes and they're the 
first dome team ever to reach a Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, their defensive starters average 30 years, meaning the  
heat might get to them. 
</P>
<P>
	The division?  
</P>
<P>
	In the regular season, the Falcons split their games against the  
49ers, a seriously declining dynasty, then beat San Francisco 20-18 
in a playoff game at the Georgia Dome. They swept everyone else in 
their division: Carolina, which finished 4-12; St. Louis (4-12), 
and New Orleans (6-10). 
</P>
<P>
	Their biggest regular-season win was 41-10 at New England  
against a playoff team. But the Falcons' win over Minnesota was the 
biggest in team history and certainly validated their status. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're the most balanced defense in the NFL,'' said Brian  
Billick, the new head coach of the Baltimore Ravens, who was 
Minnesota's offensive coordinator for the NFC title game. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have no superstar, but they have no weaknesses. On most  
teams, you can say, `We can go at this guy or that guy.' That's not 
true with Atlanta.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, they are the Falcons, a team that people rarely used in  
the same sentence with the words ``Super Bowl'' unless they were 
listing teams that had never been there. 
</P>
<P>
	Even their players sometimes thought that way.  
</P>
<P>
	``I guess this is a sign the world's coming to an end,'' said  
Morten Andersen, who never had been beyond the first round of the 
playoffs in 17 seasons with New Orleans and Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Not quite.  
</P>
<P>
	But Andersen learned firsthand about Super Bowl week, answering  
questions in German for German TV and politely telling a questioner 
who asked about growing up in the Netherlands that he was born in 
Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
	Those kinds of things are routine at the Super Bowl.  
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons aren't.

<HEADLINE> GOP Takes Credit for Welfare Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma on Saturday  
credited his fellow Republicans with reducing welfare rolls. 
</P>
<P>
	``More Americans who were once trapped in a failed welfare  
system are achieving independence,'' Keating said Saturday. ``It is 
almost entirely the result of reforms crafted by the states, under 
the leadership of visionary Republican governors,'' that have moved 
welfare recipients into schools and jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Keating gave as examples Wisconsin, where Gov. Tommy Thompson  
launched a welfare-overhaul movement in 1987 that reduced its 
welfare rolls by 90 percent, and Michigan, where he said Gov. John 
Engler has moved 200,000 families from welfare rolls to payrolls. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton announced last week that the number of people  
on welfare has fallen to the lowest level in 30 years. Nationally, 
just under 8 million people remained on welfare at the end of 
September, down 44 percent from 14.3 million in 1994. Clinton 
signed welfare overhaul legislation in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In Oklahoma, welfare cases have dropped 58 percent since 1995,  
said Keating, who chairs the Republican Governors' Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``Welfare reform comes from the states, not from Washington,''  
Keating said. ``It's a bottom-up idea that is changing lives for 
the better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP radio address, usually delivered by Republican members  
of Congress, now includes state governors. Every third Saturday, a 
governor will give the five-minute speech.

<HEADLINE> GOP Takes Credit in Welfare Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Claiming states took the lead in reforming  
welfare, Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating credited his fellow Republican 
leaders today for policies that have cut public aid caseloads. 
</P>
<P>
	In the weekly GOP radio address, Keating praised state measures  
for helping to move those on welfare into schools and jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Welfare reform ``breaks the tragic cycle of dependence that  
keeps so many Americans trapped in a dead-end system for decades. 
It restores hope and ambition,'' said Keating, chairman the 
Republican Governors' Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, President Clinton announced that the number  
of people on welfare has fallen to its lowest level in 30 years. 
Nationally, just under 8 million people remained on welfare at the 
end of September, down 44 percent from 14.3 million in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a historic change for the better and it is almost  
entirely the result of reforms crafted by the states, under the 
leadership of visionary Republican governors,'' Keating said. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Wisconsin, where Gov. Tommy Thompson launched the  
overhaul movement in 1987, has reduced its welfare rolls by 90 
percent, Keating said. Gov. John Engler of Michigan has moved 
200,000 families from welfare rolls to payrolls, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Oklahoma, Keating said, welfare cases have dropped 58 percent  
since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of simply handing out checks to anyone who qualified,  
reform measures placed time limits on how long a person could stay 
on welfare, Keating said. The changes set education and work 
requirements, forcing children on welfare to stay in school. 
</P>
<P>
	The measures added funding for transportation, child care and  
training, all of which helped ``former welfare recipients become 
proud, productive members of their community,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Welfare reform comes from the states, not from Washington.  
It's a bottom-up idea that is changing lives for the better,'' 
Keating said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican governors stayed the course, even while trying to  
gain support from the federal government, he said. Clinton signed 
the welfare overhaul legislation in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Keating said further legislation should increase the flexibility  
of governors in their own states to help individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP radio address, usually delivered by Republican members  
of Congress at both the leadership and freshman levels, now will 
also include state governors. Every third Saturday, a different 
governor will give the five-minute speech.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Acts To Stem Speculation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's Central Bank will change  
the way it reports on its foreign currency reserves and how money 
flows through the country in an attempt to stem speculation and 
capital flight. 
</P>
<P>
	The Central Bank made the announcement Friday to stop rumors  
that President Fernando Henrique Cardoso was about dismiss his 
finance minister, declare a bank holiday and freeze savings 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	In Rio, several banks ran out of money and quickly shut their  
doors, as Brazilians flocked to banks to clean out their accounts. 
In Brasilia, there were even long lines at the two bank agencies 
that operate inside the nation's Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The rumors and previous misinterpretations of banking data  
prompted the bank to change its reporting system, officials said 
late Friday in a press statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank will issue daily reports on Brazil's currency reserves  
to prove it is not using them to prop up the nation's currency, 
called the real. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has recently removed foreign exchange controls  
and the real's value compared to the dollar has fallen 41 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports on the flow of foreign currency through Brazil will now  
be released on a monthly basis, with a 15-day delay, since past 
reports were erroneously interpreted as showing a loss of foreign 
currency reserves, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Francisco Lopes, the president of the Central Bank, said the  
country's reserves are ``steady'' at $36 billion. The new measures 
are expected to begin Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Central Bank's activities have been under close scrutiny  
since the government abruptly devalued the real two weeks ago. On 
Jan. 12, it opened at 1.21 to the dollar. On Friday, trading closed 
at 2.06 to the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday evening, a visibly upset Cardoso was frustrated with  
reports he was reversing course on economic reforms and told 
reporters that the populace should pay no attention to 
rumormongers, whom he described as ``jackals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The bank lines make no sense. Those who were in line will have  
to go back Monday to put back their money because nothing is going 
to happen,'' he said. Cardoso added that the exchange rate would 
soon normalize and that it's up to the public to stem rising 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brazilians know how to control inflation,'' he said. ``Where  
there is abuse, don't buy.''

<HEADLINE> Smithsonian Collects 325,000 Items </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Last year brought 325,000 new items to the  
Smithsonian Institution's 16 museums, including 13,441 adult 
mosquitoes, two barber poles and a Stradivarius cello. 
</P>
<P>
	The Smithsonian, sometimes called the nation's attic, reported  
in September that up to the beginning of 1998 it had acquired 
141,149,152 items -- more or less -- in over 150 years of its 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	``That doesn't include every last bug in every jar,'' noted Mary  
Combs, the employee in charge of counting. 
</P>
<P>
	The mosquitoes in the latest update came from the Lloyd E.  
Rozeboom Mosquito Collection at the Johns Hopkins University School 
of Hygiene and Public Health. They went to the Museum of Natural 
History. The Smithsonian also got 3,370 insects collected in Burma 
and 413 wasps from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the cello, the Museum of American History won the  
red, white and blue barber poles, made by a company in St. Paul, 
Minn., which claims to be the only commercial manufacturer in the 
western hemisphere. With the cello were two violins and a viola, 
also made by Antonio Stradivari in Cremona, Italy, 300 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Mohan, a 29-year-old greater one-horned Asian rhinoceros, came  
from a zoo in Miami to the National Zoo, also part of the 
Smithsonian. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mohan is easily distinguished from Mechi, the zoo's  
12-year-old female rhino, by the blond hair lining his ears,'' the 
Smithsonian announced.

<HEADLINE> New Independent Council Rejected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans are predicting the demise of the  
independent counsel law now that Attorney General Janet Reno has 
rejected a special prosecutor investigation of alleged perjury by 
former White House deputy chief of staff Harold Ickes. 
</P>
<P>
	Acting minutes before a deadline Friday, Reno told a special  
court her six-month inquiry found ``no reasonable basis to believe 
that any additional investigation would ... prove that Ickes' 
testimony was knowingly and intentionally false.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There is clear and convincing evidence that Ickes did not  
intend to lie'' when asked what the Clinton administration did 
about a 1995 strike by the Teamsters union, Reno concluded in a 
35-page analysis of the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The Teamsters had contributed to Democrats in 1992, and Ickes  
was central to gathering the money for President Clinton's 1996 
re-election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate committee  
that referred Ickes' testimony for scrutiny, was disappointed by 
Reno's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``The demise of the independent counsel law when it expires this  
year may be the most notable `achievement' of her tenure as 
attorney general,'' Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said  
the decision ``spells the death of the independent counsel 
statute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno herself has ordered a study of whether the law should be  
amended when it comes up for renewal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Janet Reno has defied the spirit and the letter of the  
independent counsel statute ... Her investigation has become a 
sham,'' said Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., chairman of a House committee 
investigation of campaign financing. ``The attorney general is once 
again protecting the president and his friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton sounded a note of vindication. ``I have always had  
confidence that Harold Ickes acted lawfully and appropriately,'' he 
said in a statement. Ickes' attorneys said they were ``gratified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno's decision cut off another possible avenue for transferring  
a major portion of the Justice Department's campaign finance 
investigation to an independent counsel, a prospect raised by 
Ickes' fund-raising role. 
</P>
<P>
	Late last year, Reno also refused to order independent counsels  
to investigate Clinton and Vice President Al Gore over fund 
raising. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice campaign finance task force, which has charged 15  
people including prominent Democratic fund-raisers, continues a 
``vigorous investigation into allegations of illegal activity 
surrounding the 1996 elections,'' Reno said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ickes was accused of lying in a Sept. 22, 1997, Senate  
Governmental Affairs Committee deposition about administration 
efforts on behalf of the Teamsters in a strike against Diamond 
Walnut Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate panel asked: ``What did the administration do  
regarding the Diamond Walnut strike?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ickes responded: ``Nothing that I know of.''  
</P>
<P>
	The question was repeated but there were no follow-up questions  
defining the terms more precisely. 
</P>
<P>
	``The questions asked of Ickes were ambiguous and his answers  
were truthful under a reasonable interpretation of the question,'' 
Reno said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno noted that Ickes had volunteered to the committee that he  
talked to Teamsters executive Bill Hamilton about Diamond Walnut. 
</P>
<P>
	``That the interrogator never bothered to follow up does not  
change the fact that Ickes gratuitously gave the committee 
investigative leads relating to Diamond Walnut, which is 
inconsistent with having an intent to steer investigators away from 
the Teamsters' connection,'' Reno wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Ickes met with Teamsters leaders about the strike. A  
memo prepared for him noted $2.4 million in Teamster donations to 
Democratic candidates in 1992 and suggested the administration 
consider helping on issues like the strike if it wanted continued 
support. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a Teamsters memo, Ickes said he asked then-U.S.  
Trade Representative Mickey Kantor if he would urge Diamond Walnut 
to settle the strike. Ickes acknowledges asking Kantor to call. 
</P>
<P>
	Kantor says his call was not motivated by fund raising and the  
administration never acted to punish the company. Kantor said he 
merely asked the status of a possible settlement and applied no 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	A company executive testified there was no explicit threat, but  
the company viewed the call as part of the Teamsters' effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno concluded, ``There was nothing improper about Kantor's  
telephone call.''

<HEADLINE> Game Broadcast Threatened in Ohio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HILLSBORO, Ohio (AP) -- Highland County sheriff's deputies will  
try to ensure residents have a Super Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Vandals have sabotaged the local cable service five times in the  
last two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Extra deputies will be on patrol Sunday, watching cable lines  
that will carry the telecast of the Super Bowl to thousands homes. 
</P>
<P>
	It doesn't figure to be easy with miles of line running through  
isolated areas near this community 60 miles southwest of Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're kind of sitting here on pins and needles with the Super  
Bowl coming up,'' Sheriff Tom Horst said. 
</P>
<P>
	The string of vandalism began Jan. 18, when the Time Warner  
Cable wire south of Hillsboro was cut, affecting several hundred 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The next night, the cable was cut west of the city, forcing  
4,000 Hillsboro subscribers to miss most of the State of the Union 
address. 
</P>
<P>
	A wider area of the county of 36,000 people was affected the  
following night. Hillsboro, a city of about 6,300, and all 
customers in the southern half of the county lost service, Horst 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In each case, the cuts were in fiber-optic cables that must be  
replaced and can't be fixed by splicing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Repairs often take several hours.  
</P>
<P>
	``They are probably pushing $20,000 in repair costs,'' Horst  
said.

<HEADLINE> FAA Probes Planes Flying Too Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RESTON, Va. (AP) -- The Federal Aviation Administration is  
investigating whether two planes passed too close to each other 
over a Northern Virginia suburb of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	A twin-engine Swearingen Merlin turboprop used by the military  
and a Beech 1900 commuter plane belonging to Mesa Air may have come 
within a mile of each other, far too close under FAA rules, in the 
skies over Reston, Va., Friday at 5:34 p.m., FAA spokesman Les Dorr 
said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA requires that airplanes flying in that area must be  
separated by at least three miles horizontally and 1,000 feet 
vertically. In Friday's event, the airplanes were reported flying 
at the same level vertically but were separated by less than a mile 
horizontally, Dorr said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 21-seat Beech 1900 was headed to Dulles airport, Dorr said.  
Local radio and television stations reported the plane originated 
in Newburgh, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	The Merlin, which can carry up to 14 passengers, was a civilian  
plane being used by the military and took off from Andrews Air 
Force Base, said Dorr, who had no other information on the two 
aircraft. Air Force Sgt. Tony Williams said a similar plane with 
the same identification code had left Andrews at about that time 
and was headed to Madison, Wis., but Andrews officials said they 
had no information on the alleged near miss. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA is looking into ``the circumstances of how the aircraft  
got so close and what mistakes were made, if any,'' Dorr said.

<HEADLINE> Major Airlines Raise Fares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In a move that could signal the first  
across-the-board air fare hike in 18 months, several major airlines 
raised fares by up to 4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta Air Lines was the first to raise prices Friday on business  
tickets by 2 percent and leisure tickets by 4 percent, a move that 
was quickly matched by Northwest Airlines, Continental Airlines, 
American Airlines and America West Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest's participation in the fare hike was significant  
because its reluctance to raise fares had thwarted attempts last 
year to implement increases. Shares of its stock rose almost 18 
percent on the news.

<HEADLINE> Can Karl Malone Deliver Again? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- He didn't realize it when Dennis Rodman  
slammed him to the canvas of a wrestling ring. It never came up 
during his talk-radio gabfests with somebody named Vic the Brick. 
</P>
<P>
	But near the end of Karl Malone's wacky offseason, he came to a  
simple realization: He's never had it so good. 
</P>
<P>
	``With all the stuff that's gone on this summer, I've had to  
grow up quick,'' the 35-year-old Malone said. ``Dealing with all 
this negative stuff makes you think about things in a different 
way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two months after vowing never again to play for the Utah Jazz,  
Malone is back with his only team and refocused on his only 
remaining goal -- winning the NBA championship that has eluded him 
for 13 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Will I ever wrestle again? Probably not,'' he said, referring  
to the World Championship Wrestling match against Rodman in San 
Diego last July. ``That's something that I just wanted to do, and I 
did it. I don't have any regrets, but now it's time to move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reason for his change of heart is simple.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've always wanted to win a championship, and the Utah Jazz  
have a great shot this year,'' he said. ``I have to be a part of 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the shortened, Michael Jordan-less season may be  
Malone's best and last chance to lead the aging Jazz to the title. 
While other teams jockeyed to fill their rosters after the lockout, 
the Jazz return almost exactly the same cast that has won two 
straight Western Conference championships. 
</P>
<P>
	That stability -- and the fact that 50 games are much easier on  
aching bones than 82 -- could propel the Jazz deep into the playoffs 
again. But it won't happen unless Malone can play a third straight 
remarkable season. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, he followed up his 1997 MVP campaign with another  
stellar performance. He finished third in the league in scoring, 
sixth in rebounding and ninth in field-goal percentage while 
leading Utah to a league-best 62-20 record. 
</P>
<P>
	In the playoffs, he continued his strong play as the Jazz  
squeezed past the Rockets and Spurs before sweeping an 
overconfident Lakers team in the conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone was still on his game in the NBA Finals, but so was  
Jordan. Malone's final touch of the season was a microcosm of the 
series and even his career: While he was looking the other way, 
Jordan sneaked around him and swatted the ball out of his hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan dribbled downcourt and hit the championship-winning shot.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's some times you've just got to work harder,'' Malone  
said. ``We didn't get it done, and that's a lot of my 
responsibility. But that doesn't mean I'm going to stop working 
hard or trying to win it the next time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But then came an offseason, lengthened by the six-month lockout,  
during which Malone managed to offend his fans, teammates and the 
front office with increasingly wild statements, many of which he 
retracted. 
</P>
<P>
	Few people have their midlife crises covered by the media, but  
Malone's misadventures have been chronicled with a scrutiny that 
has unnerved him -- and made him wiser. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to be more careful with what I do and say, I realize  
that,'' he said. ``Some things can be distracting, and I got a lot 
of that out of the way. I'm ready to just play basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While his mind may have wandered, Malone's formidable skills --  
and his prodigious work ethic -- have remained. Although he was 
absent from the Jazz's informal workouts during the fall, he kept 
to his offseason training schedule and is in great shape. 
</P>
<P>
	``Karl's always ready to play. That's never in doubt with him,''  
coach Jerry Sloan said. ``He did what he had to do this summer, but 
he made sure he was ready to compete when it was time to get back 
on the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Publicly, Malone has done little to endear himself to his  
teammates during the last two years. He began last season by 
criticizing the big-money deals signed by Greg Ostertag and Bryon 
Russell. Then in November he said he wanted to leave Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Jazz hold no grudges against their captain, in part  
because their fates are entwined with his. When Malone does well, 
so does Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad to see they got things done. To lose him would have  
been a shame,'' Russell said after Malone and owner Larry Miller 
announced plans to keep the Mailman in Utah for the rest of his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone has also gained perspective on his situation through his  
mother-in-law, who has colon cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``You learn that your family's important to you, and you learn  
to not worry about the things that don't matter,'' Malone said. 
``It makes you a different person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The older-but-wiser Malone has also taken out an elaborate  
insurance policy that allows him to pursue almost all of his 
outdoor hobbies. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing it won't do is let me hunt on horseback,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond his famously balding head, Malone has yet to show the  
effects of age. He plans to sign a new deal with the Jazz next 
summer -- hopefully while wearing a championship ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told Bryon and Shandon Anderson that when I can't get up the  
floor on the break with them, that's when I'll retire,'' he said, 
smiling. ``Oh, but I can still get up the floor.''

<HEADLINE> Germans Clash Over WWII Exhibit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIEL, Germany (AP) -- German leftists pelted extreme right-wing  
protesters with stones on Saturday, slightly injuring 10 people 
outside an exhibition about World War II atrocities. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,000 extreme rightists were marching to protest the  
exhibition, which shows atrocities committed by ordinary German 
soldiers, as well as special SS units, in eastern Europe during the 
war. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 600 leftists threw stones and clashed with police, who  
ordered the march route shortened to try to contain the violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Police in Kiel, the capital of Schleswig-Holstein state, said 59  
people were arrested. Two policemen, seven protesters and a 
bystander were slightly injured, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	An earlier demonstration organized by the Greens, the junior  
partner in the ruling center-left government, attracted about 1,000 
people and was peaceful. Demonstrators frequently have clashed 
outside the exhibition, which is touring Germany.

<HEADLINE> Jimmy Key Retires After 15 Seasons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Jimmy Key, who won the clinching games of the  
1996 and 1992 World Series, is all done at age 37. 
</P>
<P>
	The left-hander, who won 186 games in 15 major league seasons,  
announced his retirement Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Key spent more than two months on the disabled list with an  
inflamed rotator cuff last season, winding up 6-3 with a 4.20 ERA 
in 11 starts and 14 relief appearances for the Baltimore Orioles. 
He became a free agent after the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Key said he decided to retire after considering his career, the  
health of his arm and his personal life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I deeply appreciate the many fans that have cheered and  
encouraged me, both on and off the field,'' he said. ``Without 
them, we as players would not have the opportunities that are made 
available to us as major leaguers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Key, who finished with a 186-117 career record and a 3.51 ERA,  
was bothered the past few seasons by a shoulder injury kept him off 
the mound, often for months at a time. 
</P>
<P>
	Known for his outstanding control and array of off-speed  
pitches, Key began his career in 1984 with Toronto and played nine 
seasons with the Blue Jays. He went 2-0 in the 1992 World Series 
against Atlanta, winning the clinching Game 6 in relief. 
</P>
<P>
	He pitched for the New York Yankees from 1993-96. In his final  
appearance for the Yankees, he started and won Game 6 against 
Atlanta for the 1996 championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Key was on the disabled list twice with the Yankees in 1996 but  
still won 12 games. In 1995, the rotator-cuff injury ended his 
season in May when he had shoulder surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Key reached the postseason six times, going 5-2 overall in 14  
games. He was picked as an AL All-Star five times.

<HEADLINE> Lawrence Taylor Makes Hall of Fame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Lawrence Taylor was right. His election to the Pro  
Football Hall of Fame really was a no-brainer. 
</P>
<P>
	The troubled linebacker was a first-ballot choice today, voted  
into the Canton, Ohio, shrine along with Eric Dickerson, Tom Mack, 
Ozzie Newsome and old-timer Billy Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
	Induction ceremonies are scheduled for July 31.  
</P>
<P>
	Taylor's candidacy was a topic of controversy throughout Super  
Bowl week. He has had repeated scrapes with drugs, was found guilty 
of filing false income tax returns and was questioned by a grand 
jury investigating organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
	All of those things weighed against him in minds of some of the  
36 writers on the voting panel, even though, unlike baseball, there 
are no ``good citizenship'' requirements in the bylaws of 
football's hall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't apologize for anything,'' Taylor said Monday in a  
conference call with reporters. ``There are some things in all our 
lives we wish we could change. Unfortunately, we can't do that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't worry about the choices I made. When my days are over  
I'll have to answer for everything I've done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor had the endorsement of NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Hall is about performance on the field,'' Tagliabue said  
Friday. ``Lawrence was one of the greatest players ever; he changed 
the way the game is played. I think the public understands that by 
making a judgment on what he did on the field, you're not judging 
what he did off it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, star linebacker for the New York Giants from 1981-93,  
was the dominant defensive player of his time. A three-time choice 
as Defensive Player of the Year, he was the NFL's most valuable 
player in 1986 and was selected for a record 10 consecutive Pro 
Bowls. He finished his career with 132.5 sacks, not including 9.5 
recorded in 1981 before sacks became and official statistic. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor needed support from 80 percent of the voters present.  
Final votes were not announced. 
</P>
<P>
	The list of 15 candidates was reduced to seven finalists. Of  
those seven, only Pittsburgh Steelers receiver Lynn Swann and 
Oakland Raiders defensive lineman Howie Long were not elected. 
</P>
<P>
	Others eliminated early in the process were coaches George Allen  
and Marv Levy, Pittsburgh Steelers owner Dan Rooney, defensive end 
Carl Eller, punter Ray Guy, wide receiver John Stallworth, tackle 
Ron Yary and defensive end Jack Youngblood. 
</P>
<P>
	Dickerson, who ran for a record 2,105 yards in 1984 wound up  
third on the career rushing list with 13,259. 
</P>
<P>
	Dickerson said that while many consider his record rushing  
season his greatest accomplishment, he is prouder of his 1,808 
yards as a rookie. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I look back on it, you get one shot to get that rookie  
record,'' he said. ``I came in as an unproven player in my first 
year and did that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mack was an 11-time Pro Bowl choice when he played for the Los  
Angeles Rams and one of the best blocking guards of his generation. 
He played in 184 consecutive games, never missing a game in his 
13-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsome, tops all tight ends in receptions with 662 catches for  
7,980 yards and 47 touchdowns in 13 seasons with the Cleveland 
Browns. He had back-to-back 89-catch seasons in 1983 and 1984 and 
played in 197 consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw, a guard, played nine seasons with the Buffalo Bills and  
was named to pro football's All-Decade team of the '60s and to the 
all-time AFL team.

<HEADLINE> Court Upholds Child Porn Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- An appeals court has upheld a federal law  
that makes it illegal to possess computer images of children 
engaging in sex, regardless of whether the images show a real child 
or an altered image. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Jay McCloskey said Friday it's the first time an  
appeals court has ruled on the validity of the Child Pornography 
Protection Act of 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``We term it a landmark decision that brings our federal child  
pornography laws into the computer age,'' said federal prosecutor 
Mark Terison. 
</P>
<P>
	The law targets computer technology that can be used to alter an  
innocent picture of a child into a picture of a child engaged in a 
sexually explicit act. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision, made Wednesday by the 1st Circuit Court of  
Appeals, overturned a lower court ruling that had declared the law 
unconstitutionally vague. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court said the statute is not so vague that a  
consumer could not understand what type of pornography is illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the ruling, McCloskey said his office would pursue  
charges against David Hilton, 48, of Norway, Maine, who was charged 
with possession of child pornography. 
</P>
<P>
	Hilton characterized himself as an anti-pornography crusader and  
met with FBI and customs officials on a number of occasions to 
discuss material that was sent to him via the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	But federal officials began to suspect Hilton's motives were  
less pure. He continued to collect the material despite warnings 
that it was illegal to do so, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hilton said Friday that he was not aware of the ruling.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still going to fight it,'' he said. ``There's a lot to  
this that hasn't been made public. The fact of the matter is I'm 
not guilty of what they're saying.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- This is a different Daytona, a track  
that runs nothing like it does at the NASCAR races that made the 
venue famous. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rolex 24 -- the twice-around-the-clock endurance race that  
began Saturday -- transforms Daytona International Speedway into a 
road course. 
</P>
<P>
	Included is a 1.5-mile, seven-turn infield portion with hairpin  
curves that bypasses the first 100 yards of the first turn of the 
NASCAR oval. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, there's the chicane -- a fixture in road races like these --  
that runs through the back part of the raceway, severely curtailing 
speeds before the cars head into the oval's third turn. 
</P>
<P>
	On the backstretch, top speeds climb to as high as 190 mph.  
That's a lot like NASCAR, but the fast stretches last only seconds 
instead of hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Other differences are purely visual, including:  
</P>
<P>
	--A mini-carnival with a Ferris wheel and other rides in the  
infield, a feature that comes out to make room for more fans once 
this race is over. 
</P>
<P>
	--Cars running with headlights, something you won't see in any  
NASCAR race. 
</P>
<P>
	--Fans actually leaving before the race ends, then returning the  
next day -- a common practice in 24-hour events. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the differences, there also are plenty of familiar  
sights here for NASCAR fans, who will descend en masse next week 
for the next phase of Speed Weeks, which reaches a crescendo Feb. 
14 with the Daytona 500. 
</P>
<P>
	One familiar aspect is the presence of Winston Cup driver Ernie  
Irvan, who is driving a BMW M3 sports car, competing in the GT3 
class. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	COME ONE, COME ALL: Trying to boost attendance and take  
advantage of the track's new lighting system, race officials began 
offering a $5 grandstand ticket beginning at 7 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rolex 24 normally draws between 25,000-30,000 fans and  
rarely seats more than a few hundred people at a time in the 
grandstands, with most choosing the busier infield. 
</P>
<P>
	The track said for $5, fans could enter in the evening and spend  
the rest of the race in the grandstand area. The new lighting 
system was turned on to 20 percent capacity at nightfall, allowing 
fans to see the action from the grandstand. 
</P>

<P>
	WINNING CAR: In three starts, the Doyle-Risi Racing Team's  
Ferrari 333SP has yet to finish below second place in its class. 
</P>
<P>
	It earned the victory in its class last year at the 24 Hours of  
LeMans and won the inaugural Petite LeMans last fall at Road 
Atlanta. It also finished second at the 1,000 Kilometers of Monza 
in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	TEAM TALL: Is this a school picture or an auto race?  
</P>
<P>
	The Corvette Racing team took a novel approach to dividing up  
drivers for its two new cars. It decided to go by height. 
</P>
<P>
	In one car are Ron Fellows (6-foot-2), John Paul Jr. (6-4) and  
Chris Kneifel (6-6), who used to drive in the CART Champ car series 
with his upper body sticking out of the small open cockpits. 
</P>
<P>
	The team's other car is being driven by Scott Sharp, Andy  
Pilgrim and John Heinricy, all drivers under 6-feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
	The strategy saves time when new drivers take the wheel because  
crews don't have to place new seats in the cars to adjust to the 
new driver's height. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	EARLY PROBLEMS: Driver Don Kitch Jr. couldn't mask his  
frustration after his Porsche encountered trouble with the gearbox 
just minutes into the race. 
</P>
<P>
	The Alex Job Racing car got back into the race, but was buried  
in 21st place in the GT3 field after six hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're here to win,'' Kitch said. ``You can't win when you do  
this stuff. It's the third year in a row for me here with something 
like this. I can't seem to get any luck here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kitch's car wasn't the first to encounter troubles, however.  
</P>
<P>
	The Greycliff Racing Porsche left after completing just three  
laps, a victim of ring and pinion problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Perspective Racing Porsche hit the wall and spun  
out on its seventh lap. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not exactly sure what happened,'' said driver Bob Wollek,  
a four-time race winner. ``Something broke at the fastest part of 
the course, I don't know what. I am sore now. Anybody would be.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	SEASONED VETERAN: Hurley Haywood made his record 26th appearance  
in the Rolex 24, driving the DLW Racing Can-Am Ford along with Dale 
and Don Whittington and former Rolex and Indianapolis 500 winner 
Danny Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
	A five-time champion in the race, Haywood, 51, is in a slump of  
sorts at the Rolex. He hasn't won since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it's been an impressive career, which began when he drove  
a Porsche 914/6 to 29th place back in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	Haywood also has won the 24 Hours of LeMans three times and the  
1981 Sebring 12 Hours. 
</P>
<P>
	His 26 starts are five more than Jim Downing, who was driving  
the Mazda Kudzu as part of the Downing-Atlanta, Inc. team.

<HEADLINE> Unsafe Sex Increases Among Gays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sexually transmitted diseases are reported up  
among some groups of gay men. Federal officials are worried about a 
survey in San Francisco showing dramatic increases in unsafe sex 
since 1994. And two weeks ago in Greenwich Village, a 
standing-room-only crowd of 300 people attended a meeting on 
``barebacking'' -- a term that means sex between gay men without 
condoms. 
</P>
<P>
	Risky sexual behavior is on the rise in the gay community. It's  
casually described by gay men discussing their personal lives and 
increasingly documented by epidemiologists and gay organizations 
around the country. If the trend continues, HIV infection rates, 
now steady, could rise again. 
</P>
<P>
	The reasons are simple: AIDS is viewed differently now that new  
drugs are enabling people with HIV infections to live relatively 
normal lives. The safe-sex message is being ignored; young gay men 
who did not witness AIDS suffering firsthand are becoming cavalier, 
even defiant, about unprotected sex; and HIV-positive people are 
healthy enough to be sexually active, increasing the chance that 
they could spread the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a real sea change of attitude,'' said Mark King,  
education director for AID Atlanta, an AIDS testing site that 
reports a 50 percent increase in people testing positive for HIV 
since 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're getting from person after person in the post-test  
counseling office is that they slipped up (on using condoms) more 
in the last year than in all the previous years,'' King added. 
``Young men think the crisis is under control. They think the new 
HIV medicines are going to save their lives, although we have no 
assurances that that is true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some younger men feel they missed out on the 1970s, when gay men  
were coming out of the closet and into discos, bathhouses and 
parties for casual, and sometimes anonymous, sex. Others express a 
bleak nihilism -- a sense that because they are gay, infection is 
inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Valenzuela, a 30-year-old struggling writer from Los  
Angeles, is HIV-positive and makes no apologies for gay men, 
himself included, who have unprotected sex without disclosing their 
HIV status. 
</P>
<P>
	``I come from a generation that has normalized the epidemic,''  
Valenzuela said. ``It's not my experience to lose half of my 
friends and feel the debilitating effects of the virus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Valenzuela said he cannot help but feel that transmitting HIV to  
another is not that horrible of a thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have a reaction to it the way people who have had so  
much loss around it. ... I wish I could say that to people and not 
be heard as defiant, irresponsible, delusional.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Valenzuela says he never volunteers his HIV status unless a sex  
partner asks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel comfortable to assume that they have a body of  
knowledge,'' he said. ``I feel like it's a consensual act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he says he avoids sex acts that involve transmitting his  
bodily fluids to others, decreasing the risk of spreading HIV. 
</P>
<P>
	Valenzuela spoke at the barebacking forum Jan. 19 at the New  
York Gay and Lesbian Community Services Center. While he was 
publicly admonished by many in the audience of mostly older men, 
``there must have been 20 people who came up to me afterwards and 
said, 'I'm exactly where you're at,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	There are an estimated 40,000 new HIV infections annually, and  
there's no evidence that the number has gone either up or down in 
recent times, according to the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	However on Thursday the CDC cited what it called a significant  
survey by STOP AIDS, an advocacy group, of 21,857 gay men in San 
Francisco, of whom 39.2 percent reported having unprotected anal 
sex in 1997, up from 30.4 percent in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's happening a lot in the younger group, and the younger  
group hasn't grown up watching their partners and friends die of 
this disease,'' said Dr. Richard Steketee of the CDC's HIV/AIDS 
prevention branch. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Elovich, director of prevention for the Gay Men's Health  
Crisis, told the audience at the barebacking forum that 
``simpleminded slogans -- such as 'Use a condom every time' -- have 
become invisible, like the surgeon general's warning on the 
cigarette pack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Older gay men, he said, have ``started a kind of finger-wagging,  
saying, 'You should do this because of what I've learned,''' while 
younger gay men are saying: ``Get off me. Allow me to have my own 
experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Will, 38, a professional musician who lives in the New York area  
and who would not give his surname, has seen 68 friends die, takes 
26 pills a day, suffers from fungus infections, nausea and 
diarrhea. 
</P>
<P>
	This does not stop him from having unprotected sex.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like we have a lot to lose,'' he said. ``In my last  
days on this planet, I do not want celibacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 

</P>
<P>
	Indicators of increased risky sex and illnesses among gays:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The number of young gay men who reported having unprotected  
anal sex went up from 35 percent in 1994 to 52 percent in 1997 
(Young Men's Health Study, conducted by researchers at the 
University of California at San Francisco). 
</P>
<P>
	-- Thirty percent of 2,543 young gay men surveyed in Baltimore,  
Miami, Dallas and four cities in California reported having 
unprotected sex, and 7 percent of them were HIV-positive (Centers 
for Disease Control). 
</P>
<P>
	-- At AID Atlanta, one of the largest AIDS testing sites in the  
Southeast, the number of people testing positive for HIV was up 50 
percent between 1997 and 1998. Eighty percent of AID Atlanta's 
clients were exposed to HIV via sexual transmission rather than 
needle-sharing. (AID Atlanta). 
</P>
<P>
	-- Two-thirds of gay men surveyed in Chicago, Denver and San  
Francisco said they had unprotected sex at least once in the last 
18 months. (Report to the 1998 World AIDS conference in Geneva). 
</P>
<P>
	-- More than 20 percent of HIV-positive men in San Francisco and  
New York report engaging in unprotected sex with an HIV-negative 
partner or a partner whose HIV status they did not know. (Centers 
for Disease Control).

<HEADLINE> Slaney Legal Team Challenges IAAF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) -- Lawyers for Mary Slaney presented  
research Saturday at her trial that they claim undermines the 
controversial drug test that got her suspended in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Slaney, considered the best woman's distance runner in U.S.  
history, gave a urine sample during the 1996 U.S. Olympic trials 
that showed a testosterone-epitestosterone (T-E) ratio above the 
6-1 limit. 
</P>
<P>
	The case that saw Slaney suspended the following year, then  
reinstated, is expected to be decided early next week. The hearing 
began Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Slaney's legal team collected research from statisticians and  
endocrinologists at Duke University that suggests the testing that 
she underwent is flawed for women in their late 30s and early 40s 
who take birth control pills. Slaney, 40, took birth control pills 
at the time, according to her legal team. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Amateur Athletic Federation, track and field's  
world governing body, maintains that the T-E test is an accurate 
method of detecting testosterone in athletes. The 
naturally-occurring hormone taken in concentrated form can improve 
an athlete's performance, mainly by building muscle mass. 
</P>
<P>
	The so-called T-E ratio normally is about 1-1.  
</P>
<P>
	Both sides called expert witnesses, who were cross-examined by  
the three judges who will decide the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hearings like this are carried out when we feel that national  
federations may have made erroneous decisions,'' Arne Ljungqvist, 
an IAAF vice president and head of the body's medical commission, 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no reason to question the validity of the T-E ratio.''  
</P>
<P>
	In May 1997, the IAAF suspended Slaney, the 1983 world 1,500-  
and 3,000-meter champion, claiming that USA Track &AMP; Field was slow 
in investigating the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	USATF then imposed its suspension. But Slaney challenged the  
ruling, and in September 1997, the U.S. federation cleared her. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF later also cleared Slaney to compete, but referred the  
case to arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing continues Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Although a decision is expected next week, the IAAF has up to  
two weeks to make it public.

<HEADLINE> Court Upholds Child Porn Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- An appeals court has upheld a federal law  
that makes it illegal to possess computer images of children 
engaging in sex, regardless of whether the images show a real child 
or an altered image. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Jay McCloskey said Friday it's the first time an  
appeals court has ruled on the validity of the Child Pornography 
Protection Act of 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``We term it a landmark decision that brings our federal child  
pornography laws into the computer age,'' said federal prosecutor 
Mark Terison. 
</P>
<P>
	The law targets computer technology that can be used to alter an  
innocent picture of a child into a picture of a child engaged in a 
sexually explicit act. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision, made Wednesday by the 1st Circuit Court of  
Appeals, overturned a lower court ruling that had declared the law 
unconstitutionally vague. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court said the statute is not so vague that a  
consumer could not understand what type of pornography is illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the ruling, McCloskey said his office would pursue  
charges against David Hilton, 48, of Norway, Maine, who was charged 
with possession of child pornography. 
</P>
<P>
	Hilton characterized himself as an anti-pornography crusader and  
met with FBI and customs officials on a number of occasions to 
discuss material that was sent to him via the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	But federal officials began to suspect Hilton's motives were  
less pure. He continued to collect the material despite warnings 
that it was illegal to do so, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hilton said Friday that he was not aware of the ruling.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still going to fight it,'' he said. ``There's a lot to  
this that hasn't been made public. The fact of the matter is I'm 
not guilty of what they're saying.''

<HEADLINE> Clippers Eye Big Olowokandi Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Clippers finally have their  
Michael. 
</P>
<P>
	No, the Clippers don't expect Michael Olowokandi to be a  
superstar like Michael Jordan, but they're hopeful the rookie 
center will make a significant contribution during the abbreviated 
season, which begins next Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The first pick in last summer's NBA draft, Olowokandi took part  
in his first Clippers practice Saturday -- a light shootaround 
several hours before the team's second and final exhibition game 
against the Los Angeles Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He should be a help to us,'' Clippers forward Rodney Rogers  
said. ``He's a big guy, that's what we're looking for. We have to 
get him ready to bang against NBA bodies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olowokandi, a 7-foot, 269-pounder, said he couldn't wait.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ecstatic to be here,'' said Olowokandi, who arrived in Los  
Angeles from Italy and signed a contract on Friday. ``I'm fine, I'm 
healthy, I'm ready to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olowokandi said he wouldn't play against the Lakers on Saturday  
night, and would take part in his first strenuous practice Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once practice starts, I'll have some idea what I'm supposed to  
do,'' he said. ``Hopefully, I'll be ready to play and contribute 
(when the season starts). I have to get more acquainted with the 
team and its philosophy. In due time, I think that will take place. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of work to do. Obviously, I want to help right  
away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's something the Clippers definitely need, considering they  
were 17-65 last season; added no high-profile free agents after the 
lockout was settled, and were manhandled by the Lakers 107-76 in 
their exhibition opener Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to see a smile and a willingness to come out here  
and want to be a player,'' first-year Clippers coach Chris Ford 
said of Olowokandi. ``He seems like a fine young man. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a week behind the rest of his teammates. He's going to  
have to do much more behind the scenes. He's big, he's mobile, he 
looks like he's going to be a good addition to this club. We've got 
to get Michael ready to go as fast as we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford said he expects Olowokandi to contribute to some degree  
right away. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a bright young man, I think he'll pick it up quickly,''  
Ford said. ``Just imagine if he came in the 17th (of February) or 
whatever they were talking about. He'd really be behind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olowokandi was released from his contract by Kinder Bologna of  
the Italian League on Monday. Originally, he was bound to that team 
until Feb. 15 -- 10 days after the start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The 23-year-old former University of Pacific star averaged 7.7  
points and 5.8 rebounds and just 14 minutes in six games with 
Kinder Bologna, and was anxious to join the Clippers upon finding 
out the lockout was resolved shortly after he joined the Italian 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``My No. 1 thing was to be in shape,'' he said. ``You do have to  
be in shape to play in Europe, they don't have all those timeouts. 
I'm glad I went based on the information I had before (the lockout 
was settled). 
</P>
<P>
	``I was in shape, but I did have tendinitis (in his right knee).  
It feels much better. I didn't get the treatment I needed. To get 
treatment, I had to go to a general hospital.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite that problem, Olowokandi said he had no regrets about  
going to Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Outside of basketball, I had a blast,'' he said. ``It was a  
positive experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he understood why his playing time was limited.  
</P>
<P>
	``The coach was intent on going with the guys who were going to  
play on the team,'' he said. ``I can't blame him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Olowokandi is one of the guys playing for the Clippers.

<HEADLINE> Interests Mar Salt Lake Games Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Utah Attorney General Jan Graham served on  
the Salt Lake Olympic bid committee's board of directors in the 
late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham did not disclose that information last week when she  
launched her own investigation of the Salt Lake Organizing 
Committee bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Graham was in private practice with a Salt Lake law  
firm. She was elected attorney general in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham was a member of the bid committee during a period when  
Salt Lake City attempted to win the 1998 Winter Olympics, which 
were awarded to Nagano, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	It's unclear when Graham left the board, though no allegations  
of impropriety have surfaced in Salt Lake City's bid to win the 
1998 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympics critic Stephen Pace said Graham's role with the  
Olympics board presents a tremendous conflict in leading an 
investigation of SLOC. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's just going to have to recuse herself, that's all,'' said  
Pace, who was an early critic of the games. ``At a minimum, she 
should ask the Utah State Bar or the American State Bar Association 
what to do. She tangles up her legal briefs if she doesn't turn the 
investigation over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graham's Olympics connections are not her office's only  
potential conflict. Her spokesman, Palmer DePaulis, was mayor of 
Salt Lake City from 1985 through 1991 and was actively involved in 
lobbying for the 1998 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been asked not to make any public statements on this  
because of my position right now,'' DePaulis said. 
</P>
<P>
	DePaulis said assistant attorney general Reed Richards will lead  
their office's investigation of SLOC.

<HEADLINE> Old Masters Sold at Record Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two old master paintings fetched record highs  
this week at Christie's and Sotheby's auction houses. 
</P>
<P>
	A recently rediscovered old Spanish painting by Diego de Silva y  
Velazquez fetched $8.9 million at Christie's on Friday, the highest 
price ever paid for a Spanish old master painting and a record for 
the artist at auction. 
</P>
<P>
	The day before, a work by Nicolas Poussin sold for $6.7 million  
at Sotheby's, a record high for the artist. It was bought 
anonymously over the phone. 
</P>
<P>
	That painting, ``The Agony in the Garden,'' is thought to have  
been painted between 1594 and 1665. 
</P>
<P>
	The Velazquez painting, ``St. Rufina'' -- which is believed to  
have been painted in Madrid between 1632 and 1634 -- went to an 
unidentified London buyer, who entered the bidding over the phone 
at $7.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bidding was as aggressive as I have ever seen in our

	VAIL, Colo. (AP) -- Those second-place finishes that have  
frustrated Martina Ertl all winter would thrill her during the 
World Alpine Ski Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Ertl, who won the World Cup giant slalom title and placed second  
to teammate Katja Seiizinger in the overall standings a year ago, 
has had to be content with six runnerup finishes this winter 
without a victory. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been frustrating not to win, but she's nonetheless  
satisfied that she's skiing well. After all, she ranks a strong 
third in this year's overall standings behind Austria's Alexandra 
Meissnitzer and German teammate Hilde Gerg and is in the top 10 in 
the downhill, super-G and giant slalom standings. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the fast disciplines, I've been good, better than the years  
before, but giant slalom and slalom haven't been as good as they 
have been or could be,'' Ertl said during a break from super-G 
training on Saturday on Vail Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it's sport and it's always the same -- things can go up and  
down,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Second places take on an entirely different meaning in an  
Olympics or World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that now the races are just for the first three places,  
just for the medals,'' Ertl said. ``It's not the World Cup and it's 
not World Cup races. I wasn't thinking so much about the World 
Championships because I was traveling from one (World Cup) race to 
another. Now that I'm here, I know that here is the World 
Championships and they are the most important event of this 
season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ertl holds two World Championship bronze medals from giant  
slalom races in 1993 at Morioka, Japan and in 1996 at Sierra 
Nevada, Spain. In the 1997 world meet, she struggled to placings of 
12th in the GS and 16th in the super-G. 
</P>
<P>
	She turned a second-place finish into an Olympic silver medal in  
the combined at Nagano, Japan last winter and would gladly settle 
for more metal this time around in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good and I like Vail,'' said Ertl, who scored two of  
her 12 career victories here, a GS in 1994 and a super-G in 1996. 
``Skiing is good here and I hope for good weather and good slopes. 
Then the best racers will win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The run of seconds has hindered Ertl's effort to keep the  
overall title in German hands, with Seizinger out this season after 
a knee injury during summer training. But there's encouraging news 
that the Germans will have their triple threat of stars back again 
next winter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just heard from the doctor with our team that he was with  
Katja and her knees are really good, he says,'' Ertl reported. 
``She's not skiing yet but hopefully next season she will come 
back.''

<HEADLINE> Falcons' Eugene Robinson Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Atlanta Falcons safety Eugene Robinson was arrested  
on a sex solicitation charge Saturday night less than 24 hours 
before the start of the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, 36, was arrested at 9 p.m. EST and charged with  
soliciting an undercover police officer for oral sex on Biscayne 
Boulevard, a busy street frequented by prostitutes and drug 
dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did arrest a Falcon player this evening, Eugene Robinson,  
for soliciting prostitution from one of our undercover officers,'' 
police spokesman Angel Calzadilla said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson was driving a car when he offered the officer $40 for  
oral sex, Calzadilla said. He was alone at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson was released from Miami Police headquarters around 11  
p.m. to a Falcons team official. He promised to return for a court 
appearance, which is usually scheduled within 21 to 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, Robinson lounged by the pool at the team's  
hotel with his wife, Gia, and their 9-year-old son, Brandon. The 
couple also has an 11-year-old daughter, Brittany. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, who played in the last two Super Bowls with Green Bay,  
is the NFL's career active leader in interceptions with 53. 
</P>
<P>
	He signed with the Falcons as a free agent after the Packers  
decided to go with a younger player at his position. Robinson 
became the unquestioned leader of the Falcons' secondary, earning 
Pro Bowl honors, and talked frequently about his strong religious 
faith.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Workers at Mexico City's sprawling wholesale  
produce market clashed with police for several hours Saturday 
during a protest against a newly imposed entry fee. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 35 people, including several police officers, were  
injured, the government news agency Notimex said. Police spokesman 
Jorge Herrera said 122 protesters were arrested, and seven police 
patrol cars were wrecked by rock-throwing demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
	A 300-man force, including mounted police and riot squads,  
showed up to break up the blockades. Two police helicopters hovered 
overhead while police fought the demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
	Since last week, administrators have required workers at the  
market to pay the equivalent of 10 cents daily to enter and up to 
about 50 cents for vehicles to cover an operating deficit. Market 
workers, who make less than the minimum wage of around $3.60 a day, 
say they cannot afford it. 
</P>
<P>
	The disturbance reportedly began early Saturday when about 500  
workers blocked market entrances, and scores of stall owners joined 
them. The market handles distribution of nearly 80 percent of the 
meat, fruit and vegetables consumed in the Mexican capital of 8.5 
million people. 
</P>

<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico's federal and state governments will  
spend about $900 million in 1999 to fight crime, including better 
training, pay and equipment for the country's beleaguered police 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
	The funding was announced at a Friday meeting of state governors  
and federal officials who make up the National Public Safety 
Program, an anti-crime task force. 
</P>
<P>
	Interior Secretary Francisco Labastida Ochoa, who oversees  
domestic security, said the spending seeks to guarantee that 
investigative police earn a minimum wage of at least $14 per day, 
while prosecutors' assistants have their wages increased to $28 
dollars per day. Labastida did not provide data on their current 
wages. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexican police, who face high levels of violent crime, will get  
more training and better patrol vehicles, and more prison cells 
will be built.

	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Colombia's highest court has stopped a  
probe into whether legislators ignored incriminating evidence 
against a former president. 
</P>
<P>
	The Constitutional Court ruled Friday that members of Congress  
enjoyed a constitutional guarantee of impunity when they voted in 
1996 to exonerate former President Ernesto Samper of charges he had 
knowingly accepted campaign contributions from the Cali drug 
cartel. 
</P>
<P>
	The House of Representatives, dominated by Samper's Liberal  
Party, in June 1996 voted overwhelmingly to clear Samper of charges 
of illicit enrichment, falsifying documents, electoral fraud and 
covering up the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States revoked then-President Samper's visa in 1996,  
convinced that he knowingly accepted $6 million from the cartel 
during his 1994 campaign. Samper denied soliciting the cartel 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
	If evidence of negligence was found, the legislators could have  
faced charges carrying prison terms of three to eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug money scandal haunted Samper throughout his presidency  
and discredited his government abroad. He was succeeded by 
President Andres Pastrana on Aug. 7.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- A congressional commission will  
recommend relaxing Brazil's abortion law and reducing punishment 
for assisted suicides of the terminally ill, a newspaper reported 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, women are allowed to have abortions only if they have  
been raped or if childbirth threatens a mother's life. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission concluded its work Friday to revise the 1940  
Penal Code and will recommend permitting abortions if a fetus has 
``grave and irreversible anomalies.'' It also will recommend 
reducing the maximum penalty for euthanasia to five years from 20, 
reported the newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, women's groups have pressured the abortion law to be  
changed because of a high number of clandestine abortions.	   According to a 1998 report by the National Network of Women's 
Health, Brazil has more clandestine abortions than the rest of 
South America put together -- 1.4 million annually -- and more than 
250,000 women are hospitalized after suffering complications 
following the operations.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Armed men stole 12 oil paintings by Mexican  
painter Rufino Tamayo from a Mexico City gallery, local media have 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Between three and five robbers entered the private gallery in an  
upscale Mexico City neighborhood late Thursday and threatened 
employees before fleeing with the canvasses in a van. 
</P>
<P>
	The value of the paintings was estimated at $2 million, the  
television network Televisa reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Tamayo, who was born in 1899 and died in 1991, rejected the  
grandiose themes of contemporary Mexican muralists and painted on a 
smaller scale, in an abstract style influenced by Mexico's 
pre-Hispanic culture.

<HEADLINE> Managers Plan Lewinsky Questioning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Impeachment prosecutors expect Monica Lewinsky  
to support an obstruction of justice charge against President 
Clinton with ``almost total recall'' of her conversations with him 
and her interpretation of what he said, House officials familiar 
with the strategy contend. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecution team believes that Ms. Lewinsky ``has a lot of  
information if you ask the right questions,'' said one House 
official, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., a soft-spoken former federal prosecutor  
and small-town lawyer, was assigned to question Ms. Lewinsky. He 
must skillfully use the former intern's interpretation of events to 
overcome Ms. Lewinsky's statement that ``no one ever asked me to 
lie, and I was never promised a job for my silence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant is expected to ask Ms. Lewinsky about her false affidavit  
in the Paula Jones case, an attempt to get her a job after she 
appeared on the Paula Jones case witness list and Oval Office 
secretary Betty Currie's retrieval of presidential gifts from the 
former intern. 
</P>
<P>
	The House team has promised to stay away from intimate details  
of her sexual relationship with the president, and any questions 
even at the edge of the subject would be approached gingerly. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant will use impressions received a week ago when he and two  
other managers informally interviewed Ms. Lewinsky, House sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials said the managers left Washington's Mayflower  
Hotel after the interview with the impression that Ms. Lewinsky 
felt ``very comfortable'' with Bryant, who demonstrated his concern 
by asking her about the difficulties she has encountered since her 
affair with Clinton became public. 
</P>
<P>
	The managers also viewed Ms. Lewinsky as an extremely  
intelligent, even-tempered witness with -- as one House source 
described it -- ``almost total recall on Clinton. She was breaking 
her neck to tell the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky's closed deposition will be the first of three  
approved by senators in Clinton's impeachment trial, which is in 
recess until Thursday. Questioning of presidential friend Vernon 
Jordan is scheduled for Tuesday and of White House aide Sidney 
Blumenthal on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lewinsky testimony is also crucial to Clinton's lawyers, who  
will have their first chance to cross-examine her. 
</P>
<P>
	All the testimony will be videotaped and reviewed by senators,  
who are expected to decide next week whether to make the 
depositions public and whether to seek live testimony by Ms. 
Lewinsky or the other witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan is virtually certain to question Ms. Lewinsky about two  
crucial dates in late 1997, after her Dec. 5 appearance on the 
witness list in Mrs. Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit against the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	On Dec. 17, Clinton called Ms. Lewinsky after 2 a.m. and told  
her about the list. Ms. Lewinsky testified earlier, ``I believe 
that I probably asked him, you know, what should I do,'' and ``He 
suggested ..., `Well, maybe you can sign an affidavit.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors contend that both Ms. Lewinsky and the president  
knew she couldn't file a truthful affidavit because that would 
reveal the affair they both had worked diligently to conceal. So 
Clinton reminded her of a cover story they had used before to 
explain their relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, you can always say you were coming to see Betty or  
that you were bringing me letters,'' Clinton was quoted by Ms. 
Lewinsky as saying. She testified, ``I knew exactly what he 
meant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Ms. Lewinsky said Clinton never explicitly told her to  
lie, Bryant could point to Ms. Lewinsky's testimony that offered 
another interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I also said that ... it wasn't as if the president  
called me and said, 'You know, Monica, you're on the witness list. 
This is going to be really hard for us. We're going to have to tell 
the truth and be humiliated.''' 
</P>
<P>
	A second key date is Dec. 28, when Ms. Lewinsky discussed with  
Clinton what to do with subpoenaed presidential gifts. Later that 
day, Oval Office secretary Betty Currie came to pick them up from 
Ms. Lewinsky's apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	``At some point I said to him, 'Well, ... maybe I should put the  
gifts away outside my house somewhere or give them to someone, 
maybe Betty.' And he sort of said -- I think he responded 'I don't 
know' or 'Let me think about that,''' Ms. Lewinsky testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors expect Ms. Lewinsky would testify the same way  
Monday, although White House lawyers have pointed out that on other 
occasions, Ms. Lewinsky couldn't remember any Clinton reaction when 
she mentioned the gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	While House managers concluded that Clinton must have sent Mrs.  
Currie for the gifts, there is no testimony from anyone that the 
president orchestrated the retrieval. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have tried to bolster their case by showing that  
Mrs. Currie called Ms. Lewinsky that day, even though Mrs. Currie 
testified that it was Ms. Lewinsky who called her. 
</P>
<P>
	The House has introduced evidence of a cellular phone call from  
Mrs. Currie to Ms. Lewinsky, which the White House attacked as 
being to short in duration to arrange the pickup and coming too 
late in the sequence of events. 
</P>
<P>
	During the informal interview, Ms. Lewinsky told the House team  
of three previous calls from Mrs. Currie earlier in the day to 
arrange the pickup -- calls that were not logged on White House 
records.

<HEADLINE> Kevorkian Lawyer May Run for Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Geoffrey Fieger, the Democratic Party's  
unsuccessful gubernatorial candidate last year, said he plans to 
seek the Democratic Party's nomination for the U.S. Senate seat 
held by first-term Republican Spencer Abraham. 
</P>
<P>
	Fieger, a flamboyant lawyer best known for his defense of Dr.  
Jack Kevorkian, said that if he loses the primary or he wins and 
Democratic leadership works to undermine him in the general 
election, he might run as an independent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am going to run,'' Fieger told The Detroit News in a story  
Sunday. ``I'll run as a Democrat as long as the Democrats don't try 
to do what they did to me in the last election.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many in his own party leadership declined to support him last  
year even after he won the Democratic nomination to challenge 
Republican Gov. John Engler, who beat Fieger with 62 percent of the 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Fieger was well-known for his blunt comments. He called Engler a  
``nincompoop'' and ``dumber than Dan Quayle and twice as ugly.'' 
Even though he was the Democratic nominee, he complained that the 
state party was full of ``wimps and oatmeal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Messages left Saturday evening at the state Democratic Party  
headquarters and at the home of a party spokeswoman were not 
immediately returned. Fieger did not return a message left 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fieger said he planned to use the Clinton impeachment trial  
against Abraham, though he said the issue will probably be old news 
by the election. 
</P>
<P>
	Abraham will not say whether he's leaning toward voting for  
Clinton's removal. He said he would not let his political 
aspirations color his decision.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Phoenix Publisher Walsh Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- Mason Walsh, former publisher of The  
Arizona Republic and The Phoenix Gazette, died Saturday due to 
complications from pneumonia. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh was publisher of the two newspapers from 1978 until his  
retirement in 1980. He began work in 1966 at the papers' corporate 
parent, Phoenix Newspapers Inc., as general manager and became 
assistant publisher in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	John Oppedahl, publisher and CEO of The Republic, called Walsh  
``a great force for professionalism in his work and for public good 
in the cities where he worked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh began his newspaper career at age 11 delivering papers for  
the Dallas Times-Herald. He worked for the Dallas Journal as a 
reporter for a year before entering Southern Methodist University, 
where he earned a political science degree in 1934. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a reporter, city editor and news editor for the Dallas  
Dispatch-Journal from 1935-42 and served as editor of the Austin 
Times-Herald in 1942. 
</P>
<P>
	During the Depression, Walsh also played violin, cello and viola  
in movie and vaudeville theaters, on radio, with dance bands and 
with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a stint in the public relations and personnel  
departments with North American Aviation in Dallas, Walsh resumed 
his journalism career in 1945 as city editor of the Dallas 
Times-Herald. He served as managing editor there from 1952-60. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1960-66, Walsh was managing editor of the Phoenix Gazette,  
an afternoon newspaper that shut down in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh was national president of the Associated Press Managing  
Editors Association in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh is survived by his wife of 51 years, Anne; sons Tim and  
Kevin, chief of bureau of the AP in Miami; a daughter, Peggy Walsh, 
former chief of bureau of the AP in San Francisco; and two 
grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Brind'Amour Game Streak Goes On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Despite badly bruised ribs, Philadelphia  
forward Rod Brind'Amour extended the NHL's longest current 
consecutive games streak to 449 on Saturday night, scoring a goal 
on his first shift against Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Brind'Amour, who left the Flyers' game against Phoenix on  
Thursday night after being checked into the boards, was doubtful 
until game time. On his first shift, he received a pass from Dan 
McGillis and put a backhanded shot past Corey Schwab for his 18th 
goal 1:42 into the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Brind'Amour scored again with 7:05 left in the first, batting in  
a rebound on McGillis' shot on a power play to give Philadelphia a 
2-0 lead. Officials let the goal stand after reviewing the replay 
and deciding it wasn't highsticking. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers initially feared Brind'Amour's ribs might be  
fractured, forcing him to miss at least two weeks. X-rays were 
negative, but he collapsed due to shortness of breath in the locker 
room after the Flyers' 4-2 victory over Phoenix and missed practice 
on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brind'Amour hasn't missed a game since Feb. 22, 1993 against  
Detroit. Teammate John LeClair has the second longest streak in the 
league at 299.

	NATO OKs Force in Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- NATO Saturday authorized its  
secretary-general to launch military action in Yugoslavia if the 
warring parties do not negotiate an agreement for autonomy in 
Kosovo. The United States and five European nations gave Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic and Kosovo's ethnic Albanians a week 
to start negotiations and another two weeks to agree on 
``substantial autonomy'' for the southern province of Serbia. They 
also backed the demand with the threat of NATO force. The Clinton 
administration welcomed NATO's move to force peace talks in 
Yugoslavia, but said it was not ready to commit troops to any 
international peacekeeping force in the region.

	A First Step in Irag Diplomacy  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The U.N. Security Council approved the  
first modest step to break the diplomatic logjam over Iraq 
Saturday, agreeing to establish panels to assess Iraqi disarmament 
and adherence to other U.N. resolutions. The agreement was the 
first formal council action on Iraq since last month's U.S. and 
British airstrikes shattered the council's uneasy unity and 
deepened divisions over how to resume oversight of Iraq's weapons

	Clinton Proposes Tax Relief  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is proposing a  
two-year reprieve for millions of middle-class people who might 
otherwise face unexpectedly higher tax bills simply because they 
took advantage of new education or child tax credits. The proposal 
would ensure that people of modest incomes who use such credits are 
not unwittingly subject to the alternative minimum tax -- a complex 
tax created to prevent the wealthy from sheltering too much income. 
Since many tax credits now benefit middle class taxpayers, they can 
conceivably lower tax bills to nothing, which could in turn trigger 
the alternative minimum tax.

	Many Flee After Colombia  
</P>
<P>
	ARMENIA, Colombia (AP) -- Thousands of Colombians made homeless  
by Monday's powerful earthquake have been boarding buses, pickup 
trucks and even horse-drawn carriages to leave this hard-hit town. 
Many are frustrated with the government's disorganized effort to 
restore order and give out relief supplies. Meantime, Colombia's 
Planning Department says residents who have to move or rebuild 
their homes will be eligible for housing grants and low-interest 
government loans. At least 940 people were killed in the 
earthquake. Hundreds more remain missing.

	NKorea Famine Seen Persisting  
</P>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- A U.N. aid coordinator Saturday warned that  
famine will persist in North Korea if more is not done to revive 
the country's decrepit rural economy. Despite massive supplies of 
food aid, shortages and famine-related illnesses have killed up to 
2 million of North Korea's 23 million people during the past three 
years, according to U.S. congressional estimates. Two-thirds of all 
children under seven are malnourished, and lack of food has stunted 
the growth of millions more. Decades of economic mismanagement 
combined with several years of bad weather brought the farming 
system in the communist nation to a state of collapse.

<HEADLINE> Holly Death Still Vivid for Vee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FARGO, N.D. (AP) -- In brand-new matching outfits, Bobby Vee and  
his teen-age band from Fargo huddled uncomfortably in the shadows 
off stage, waiting for their introduction. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey!'' the master of ceremonies whispered on stage, trying to  
get Vee's attention. ``What's the name of your band?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vee blurted out the first thing that popped into his head: ``The  
Shadows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was Feb. 4, 1959, and most of the fans out front had been  
stunned by the news that the man they came to see, Buddy Holly, was 
killed the night before in an Iowa plane crash, along with Ritchie 
Valens and J.P. ``The Big Bopper'' Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
	Vee was just 15 and was fronting a 2-week-old band.  
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't have any fear right then,'' Vee recalled recently in  
an interview at his home outside St. Cloud, Minn. ``The fear didn't 
hit me until the spotlight came on, and then I was just shattered 
by it. I didn't think that I'd be able to sing. If I opened my 
mouth, I wasn't sure anything would come out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the music did come, and that performance 40 years ago this  
week -- Vee's first public performance -- launched a rock `n' roll 
career that still earns him a paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
	An agent in the audience that night in adjacent Moorhead, Minn.,  
liked the band's sound. By June, the Fargo kid, whose real name is 
Robert Veline, was recording his first album with his band. 
</P>
<P>
	Vee went on to record hits that included ``Take Good Care of My  
Baby,'' ``Rubber Ball'' and ``Devil or Angel.'' At 55, he still 
tours about 100 days a year in the United States and Europe, often 
fronting his sons' band, The Vees. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, they will take part again in a Holly tribute at the  
Surf Ballroom in Clear Lake, Iowa, the last place Holly played. 
</P>
<P>
	Vee's memories of his first performance are still vivid -- the  
mood of the crowd, the stunned faces, the way his own voice filled 
the armory. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the evening's three headliners had been killed, the  
armory was packed. 
</P>
<P>
	``In retrospect, it seems like an odd idea because there really  
wasn't much show left,'' Vee said. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlie Boone, a local radio personality who acted as the  
concert's master of ceremonies, had gone on the air pleading for 
local bands to play that night. One of the three or four that 
volunteered was Vee's band, consisting of himself, his older 
brother, Bill, and two friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``It felt like an emergency,'' Vee said. ``They were asking for  
help and it seemed appropriate for us to call ... '' 
</P>
<P>
	Vee recalls a young Waylon Jennings, a member of Holly's backup  
band, singing a somber rendition of Valens' hit ``Donna.'' He 
finished and slipped off the stage to polite, appropriate applause. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a milestone of my life,'' he said with pride. ``It  
was the start of a wonderful career.''

<HEADLINE> Butyrskaya Wins; Russia Sweeps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- Skating cleanly but  
conservatively, Russia's Maria Butyrskaya defended her European 
Figure Skating title Saturday, then divulged her strategy for 
beating Michelle Kwan at the worlds in Helsinki. 
</P>
<P>
	The title gave the Russians sweep of all four events for the  
third consecutive year. And in an achievement unprecedented in the 
championship's 69-year-history, all the men's and women's medals go 
to the same. 
</P>
<P>
	Butyrskaya at 26 is the grande dame of European figure skating,  
a decade older than teen-age teammates Julia Soldatova, who 
finished second, and Viktoria Volchkova, in third. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither was truly Butyrskaya's rival in this competition, either  
in terms of jumping or style. Skating to a piano concerto, 
Butyrskaya's program opened with classical balletic moves, and 
maintained a graceful presence with long-held spirals and 
beautifully positioned spin combinations, hands clasped behind her 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	Butyrskaya won't be challenged artistically until she skates  
against Kwan, the Olympic silver medalist and defending world 
champions, in Helsinki from March 21-28. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I can compete with Michelle Kwan,'' Butyrskaya said.  
``Of course, she has developed a reputation as someone who is 
unbeatable. Actually, her elements aren't that strong. Her 
advantage is she skates cleanly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's exactly what Butyrskaya did during her long program -- and  
all that was needed to win in a field of talented, but unpolished, 
rivals. Skating in complete control, Butyrskaya hit seven triples 
with only one small error, a turnout on a triple loop, but did not 
attempt a triple-triple combination. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, I made little mistakes,'' Butyrskaya said. ``There's  
some work left, a new combination I want to ... at the worlds, 
where I will fight for the highest position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Soldatova, 17, was one of the few women to attempt a triple jump  
combination, a triple salchow-triple toe, but crashed. Her six 
other triples were small, and a hand went down on triple lutz. 
</P>
<P>
	Skating in her first international senior competition,  
16-year-old Volchkova started strongly with huge triple lutz-double 
toe combination and an equally impressive triple flip. But she lost 
stamina midway through the 4-minute program, singling a pair of 
axels and popping a lutz. A lingering fever had taken its toll, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian men have swept the European medals since 1996, but this  
is the first time that the women, traditionally the Russian team's 
weakest competitors, have done the same. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexei Yagudin defended his title Thursday, followed by Yevgeny  
Plushenko and Alexei Urmanov. Maria Petrova and Alexei Tikhonov won 
the pair's title and Angelika Krylova and Oleg Ovsiannikov won the 
ice dance competition.

<HEADLINE> House Managers Press On Despite Odds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The more the Senate balks, and the less likely  
conviction seems, the harder the 13 House prosecutors dig in and 
push. They are an unapologetic, self-proclaimed ``annoyance'' to 
the senators deciding President Clinton's fate. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Henry Hyde and his band of congressmen-lawyers charge ahead  
despite skittishness among fellow Republicans and polls showing 
most Americans oppose ousting Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde says their motivation is simple: ``We believe in  
something.'' But former Democratic Sen. Dale Bumpers, speaking in 
defense of the president, accused the House impeachment managers of 
``wanting to win too badly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What makes them so implacable? Certainly they believe deeply in  
their case. There also may be more personal reasons. Many are 
former prosecutors, used to going all-out to convict. Most share 
the luxury of conservative districts solidly behind them. The 
impeachment trial has turned once-obscure congressmen into national 
names -- even conservative heroes. 
</P>
<P>
	They see themselves as defenders of the honor of the House of  
Representatives, more importantly the Constitution itself. 
</P>
<P>
	They're playing to history.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone wants to be remembered somehow in history for having  
done the right thing,'' said Rep. Elton Gallegly, R-Calif., one of 
only six Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee not serving 
as prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	It's telling that the prosecutors come from Judiciary, the  
lawyer-dominated committee that wrote the articles of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	The House generally is brasher and more partisan than the  
courtly Senate, and that goes double for the Judiciary Committee. 
That panel attracts some of the most conservative and most liberal 
lawmakers for passionate debates over hot-button issues like 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's got to be somebody who's not afraid of that,'' said  
political science professor John Hibbing of the University of 
Nebraska-Lincoln. ``It takes a special kind of person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Usually that means lawmakers firmly entrenched in their seats.  
Hyde, who has served his Illinois district for 24 years, declared 
on the Senate floor that he is ``willing to lose my seat any day of 
the week'' over an issue of conscience. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's easy for him to say; he's from a fairly safe  
district,'' noted political science professor Ross K. Baker of 
Rutgers. ``He's talking to senators whose political mortality is 
much greater.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most House managers represent conservative areas -- six in  
Southern states -- where voters are disgusted with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are authentic products of their districts, reflecting a  
climate of public opinion that they don't need letters and e-mail 
to detect,'' Baker said. (An exception is Rep. James Rogan, whose 
suburban Los Angeles district, once solidly Republican, is growing 
increasingly Democratic.) 
</P>
<P>
	One, Bob Barr of Georgia, is a firebrand who demanded Clinton's  
impeachment a year before the world heard of Monica Lewinsky. Asa 
Hutchinson of Arkansas helped prosecute Clinton's brother, Roger, 
on drug charges a decade ago. There's Ed Bryant of Tennessee, 
soft-spoken and restrained; Lindsey Graham, the folksy South 
Carolinian who plays so well on-camera; and Florida's Bill 
McCollum, stern and unyielding. 
</P>
<P>
	As they pushed for rebuttal time, witnesses and a fuller trial,  
their style sometimes exacerbated the traditional tension between 
House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, a defensive Hyde told senators: ``I know what an  
annoyance we are in the bosom of this great body. But we are a 
constitutional annoyance, and I remind you of that fact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a less guarded moment, when asked about some Republican  
senators' search for a graceful end to the trial, Hyde told a 
Washington Post reporter: ``I'm glad those people weren't at Valley 
Forge or the Alamo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, a Democrat on the House Judiciary  
Committee, said the House managers should remember those who 
disagree with them also are guided by their consciences. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was somewhat offended by comments about the intrepid  
warriors, marching into political death, as if their courage in 
pursuing this was greater than the courage of the men and women 
sitting in judgment,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the managers may be rewarded for their dedication, even  
if their cause proves to be a lost one. They are earning national 
name recognition that can supercharge their fund raising or lead to 
higher office. 
</P>
<P>
	``A Lindsey Graham or an Asa Hutchinson can go to almost any  
conservative audience in the country and get support,'' Rutgers' 
Baker said. ``They're high visibility guys now.''

<HEADLINE> Unsafe Sex Increases Among Gays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sexually transmitted diseases are reported up  
among some groups of gay men. Federal officials are worried about a 
survey in San Francisco showing dramatic increases in unsafe sex 
since 1994. And two weeks ago in Greenwich Village, a 
standing-room-only crowd of 300 people attended a meeting on 
``barebacking'' -- a term that means sex between gay men without 
condoms. 
</P>
<P>
	Risky sexual behavior is on the rise in the gay community. It's  
casually described by gay men discussing their personal lives and 
increasingly documented by epidemiologists and gay organizations 
around the country. If the trend continues, HIV infection rates, 
now steady, could rise again. 
</P>
<P>
	The reasons are simple: AIDS is viewed differently now that new  
drugs are enabling people with HIV infections to live relatively 
normal lives. The safe-sex message is being ignored; young gay men 
who did not witness AIDS suffering firsthand are becoming cavalier, 
even defiant, about unprotected sex; and HIV-positive people are 
healthy enough to be sexually active, increasing the chance that 
they could spread the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a real sea change of attitude,'' said Mark King,  
education director for AID Atlanta, an AIDS testing site that 
reports a 50 percent increase in people testing positive for HIV 
since 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're getting from person after person in the post-test  
counseling office is that they slipped up (on using condoms) more 
in the last year than in all the previous years,'' King added. 
``Young men think the crisis is under control. They think the new 
HIV medicines are going to save their lives, although we have no 
assurances that that is true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some younger men feel they missed out on the 1970s, when gay men  
were coming out of the closet and into discos, bathhouses and 
parties for casual, and sometimes anonymous, sex. Others express a 
bleak nihilism -- a sense that because they are gay, infection is 
inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Valenzuela, a 30-year-old struggling writer from Los  
Angeles, is HIV-positive and makes no apologies for gay men, 
himself included, who have unprotected sex without disclosing their 
HIV status. 
</P>
<P>
	``I come from a generation that has normalized the epidemic,''  
Valenzuela said. ``It's not my experience to lose half of my 
friends and feel the debilitating effects of the virus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Valenzuela said he cannot help but feel that transmitting HIV to  
another is not that horrible of a thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have a reaction to it the way people who have had so  
much loss around it. ... I wish I could say that to people and not 
be heard as defiant, irresponsible, delusional.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Valenzuela says he never volunteers his HIV status unless a sex  
partner asks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel comfortable to assume that they have a body of  
knowledge,'' he said. ``I feel like it's a consensual act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he says he avoids sex acts that involve transmitting his  
bodily fluids to others, decreasing the risk of spreading HIV. 
</P>
<P>
	Valenzuela spoke at the barebacking forum Jan. 19 at the New  
York Gay and Lesbian Community Services Center. While he was 
publicly admonished by many in the audience of mostly older men, 
``there must have been 20 people who came up to me afterwards and 
said, 'I'm exactly where you're at,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	There are an estimated 40,000 new HIV infections annually, and  
there's no evidence that the number has gone either up or down in 
recent times, according to the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	However on Thursday the CDC cited what it called a significant  
survey by STOP AIDS, an advocacy group, of 21,857 gay men in San 
Francisco, of whom 39.2 percent reported having unprotected anal 
sex in 1997, up from 30.4 percent in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's happening a lot in the younger group, and the younger  
group hasn't grown up watching their partners and friends die of 
this disease,'' said Dr. Richard Steketee of the CDC's HIV/AIDS 
prevention branch. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Elovich, director of prevention for the Gay Men's Health  
Crisis, told the audience at the barebacking forum that 
``simpleminded slogans -- such as 'Use a condom every time' -- have 
become invisible, like the surgeon general's warning on the 
cigarette pack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Older gay men, he said, have ``started a kind of finger-wagging,  
saying, 'You should do this because of what I've learned,''' while 
younger gay men are saying: ``Get off me. Allow me to have my own 
experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Will, 38, a professional musician who lives in the New York area  
and who would not give his surname, has seen 68 friends die, takes 
26 pills a day, suffers from fungus infections, nausea and 
diarrhea. 
</P>
<P>
	This does not stop him from having unprotected sex.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like we have a lot to lose,'' he said. ``In my last  
days on this planet, I do not want celibacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 

</P>
<P>
	Indicators of increased risky sex and illnesses among gays:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The number of young gay men who reported having unprotected  
anal sex went up from 35 percent in 1994 to 52 percent in 1997 
(Young Men's Health Study, conducted by researchers at the 
University of California at San Francisco). 
</P>
<P>
	-- Thirty percent of 2,543 young gay men surveyed in Baltimore,  
Miami, Dallas and four cities in California reported having 
unprotected sex, and 7 percent of them were HIV-positive (Centers 
for Disease Control). 
</P>
<P>
	-- At AID Atlanta, one of the largest AIDS testing sites in the  
Southeast, the number of people testing positive for HIV was up 50 
percent between 1997 and 1998. Eighty percent of AID Atlanta's 
clients were exposed to HIV via sexual transmission rather than

<HEADLINE> Tenn. Man Returns After 'Death' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLLINWOOD, Tenn. (AP) -- With Bruce Littleton now sitting in  
jail, the question in this small town near the Alabama border is 
this: Who was buried in his grave? 
</P>
<P>
	His relatives say they don't know. They thought they buried  
Littleton 18 months ago after a fiery car accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Police don't know either. Forensic tests were conducted on the  
corpse exhumed from the cemetery this week but no details were 
released. Officers do believe, however, that Littleton knows who's 
buried there. 
</P>
<P>
	``The speculation is he faked his death and committed the  
homicide on the individual who was found (in his car) to avoid 
facing federal drug charges,'' said Richard Brogan of the Tennessee 
Bureau of Investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Littleton, 31, was taken into custody on Jan. 21 in Smyrna,  
about 90 miles northeast of his hometown of Collinwood. His mother, 
Doris Littleton, seemed stunned a week later. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy he's alive and has a second chance at forgiveness if  
he really did do this thing,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bizarre saga began in 1997, when Littleton was arrested on  
federal drug charges for allegedly receiving methamphetamine 
through the mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators believe he tried to ``disappear'' shortly  
thereafter, Brogan said. Sometime in late spring, his bullet-ridden 
car was found about 35 miles from Collinwood. 
</P>
<P>
	Littleton resurfaced and on July 31, 1997, the same car, with  
one person inside, hit a tree and burned. 
</P>
<P>
	``The night the body was discovered the investigators thought it  
was a really hot fire, and wondered if accelerants had been used,'' 
Brogan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Given the drug charges and suspicions about the fire,  
investigators wanted to be sure about the identity. Then-state 
Medical Examiner Charles Harlan checked dental records and declared 
the body was Littleton's. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody seems too sure how that mistake happened; Harlan won't  
talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
	The body was buried in Collinwood. The drug charges were set  
aside. Life insurance policies were paid to Littleton's wife, 
Tammy. 
</P>
<P>
	She bought a house for $105,000 on Sept. 25, 1997, in  
Murfreesboro, not far from the town where Littleton was arrested. 
Mrs. Littleton sold the property a little more than a year later at 
a small profit. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Littleton was not at her Collinwood home when a reporter  
stopped by this week. She has an unlisted telephone number. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities were checking whether she or anybody else knew  
Littleton was alive during the 18 months he was ``dead.'' They want 
to know if he had any help along the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect other charges,'' Brogan said.  
</P>
<P>
	And two insurance companies that had policies on Littleton are  
curious about whether they paid a fraudulent claim. Neither of the 
companies, Liberty National and Tennessee Farmers Mutual, would say 
how much the policies were worth. 
</P>
<P>
	Littleton was using the name Gregory Bruce Lavender when he was  
arrested on Jan. 21 for driving with an altered license plate. He 
did not have a driver's license, either, and during questioning 
admitted he actually was Bruce Alan Littleton and was supposed to 
be dead, Brogan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, Collinwood, population 1,014, is abuzz over the  
strange death-and-life story. Some residents say they believed 
Littleton was alive all along. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just didn't add up,'' said J.R. Daniels. ``I just didn't  
think it was right, the way it worked out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crawford Littleton, Bruce's uncle and a neighbor of his mother,  
said he had no idea his nephew was alive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't tell you nothing because I don't know nothing,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> Computer Opens Library Treasures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Shakespeare lovers now can use computers to  
view centuries-old pages from the first published edition of the 
playwright's works, once restricted to authorized scholars. 
</P>
<P>
	The Folger Shakespeare Library, one of the world's most  
important collections, has 79 complete copies of the First Folio, 
the first complete edition of his plays. But they are more than 375 
years old and even scholars need a good reason to touch them or 
turn the pages. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Thursday, a new multimedia exhibit called ``The  
Shakespeare Gallery'' has enabled tourists to turn at least 13 
pages. The exhibit has 240 digitized color images of the Folger's 
treasures relating to Shakespeare and his times. 
</P>
<P>
	There is a letter that Queen Elizabeth I -- one of his first  
admirers -- written in her own hand to King Henri IV of France. It 
is not about Shakespeare, but about the possibility of 
assassination and other dangers to monarchs. 
</P>
<P>
	The program includes 55 illustrated quotations from Shakespeare,  
recited as they appear on the screen by well-known actors including 
Ed Gero and Floyd King. Both are appearing in the Washington 
Shakespeare Theatre's production of the rarely seen ``King John.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There also is music of the period, sung by the Folger Consort, a  
musical group. 
</P>
<P>
	A pop-up glossary helps users frustrated by the language. The  
most difficult words appear on the screen in red, with a quick link 
to the definitions. 
</P>
<P>
	A user-friendly text asks the viewer ``Would you like to hear  
more about Ben Jonson?'' before flooding the screen with text about 
that poet. He is said to have been a drinking companion of 
Shakespeare and wrote an admiring poem that can be seen in the 
First Folio. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Shakespeare Gallery'' is meant to be used by visitors, not  
scholars. It can be seen by about 40 people at once. Nina Tovish, 
who designed it, estimates that it would take at least a day to go 
through all the links. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought it would be a raging success if people spent 15  
minutes on it,'' she said in an interview, ``but we find that it's 
hard to tear some people away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Shakespeare program can be experienced on two terminals in  
the library's exhibition hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Parts of the program may one day be reachable through the  
Folger's Internet site, but Ms. Tovish said relatively few computer 
buffs now have the equipment to get the full benefit of it.

<HEADLINE> McCain Unsure of Presidential Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- As he visited the state with the  
earliest primary, Sen. John McCain of Arizona said Saturday that he 
is within two weeks of deciding whether to seek the Republican 
nomination for president. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican war hero formed an exploratory committee Dec. 29,  
allowing him to raise money. In New Hampshire, he met with about 70 
party activists. 
</P>
<P>
	``If John decides to go, then we can put together a very  
substantial organization, which I can now see will not be very hard 
to do,'' said former U.S. Sen. Warren Rudman of New Hampshire, who 
is co-chairman of McCain's exploratory committee. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said that if he ran, he would campaign on national  
security and ensuring government is not ruled by special interests. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe my life experience, my resume, my legislative record  
and my record of public service qualifies me,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, 62, also promised not to campaign in Delaware, which is  
trying to encroach on New Hampshire's traditional status at the 
front of the primary process. He said he would sign a pledge 
requested by Gov. Jeanne Shaheen to keep New Hampshire first. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, a Navy pilot and prisoner of war for 5 1/2 years in  
Vietnam, has served in the Senate since 1986 after two terms in the 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain is one of a number of possible GOP presidential hopefuls,  
including Texas Gov. George W. Bush, former American Red Cross 
director Elizabeth Dole, former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, 
former Vice President Dan Quayle and millionaire publisher Steve 
Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	The leading Democrats are Vice President Al Gore and former Sen.  
Bill Bradley of New Jersey.

<HEADLINE> IOC Targets More Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In the wake of the Olympics' biggest corruption  
scandal ever, the list of IOC members under investigation keeps 
growing. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC vice president Dick Pound said Friday an ``indefinite  
number'' of names from the 106 committee members have been added to 
the inquiry since its initial report on the Salt Lake City case was 
released Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound refused to identify the recent additions to an  
investigation that already has led to the expulsion or resignation 
of nine members, the biggest purge in the IOC's 105 years. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said fresh information from the ethics commission  
investigating Salt Lake's successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games, 
and news involving Sydney's winning bid for the 2000 Summer Games, 
led to the latest steps. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are looking at some of the other members and not just based  
on information coming out of the Salt Lake City investigation,'' 
Pound said. ``It's an indefinite number and an indefinite line to 
follow. We will go where the trail leads us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times reported today that leaders of Salt Lake's  
effort to get the Games set up a four-year campaign in 1991 that 
included giving financial assistance to people influential in 
picking the host city. 
</P>
<P>
	Included in a budget summary presented at a meeting of the bid  
committee's board of trustees was a projection to spend about 
$500,000 on help to national Olympic committees and contracts with 
``key individuals'' in three areas of the world, the Times 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pound commission found that 14 IOC members, including one  
who has since died, took almost $800,000 in cash, travel and 
medical expenses, lavish gifts and services from the Salt Lake bid 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the resignations and expulsions announced Sunday, the  
IOC said three members remained under investigation and a fourth 
member was warned. 
</P>
<P>
	As Pound's group was finishing its ``first sweep'' of Salt Lake,  
word came that the head of the Australian Olympic Committee 
promised $70,000 to two African IOC members the night before Sydney 
won the 2000 Games by two votes over Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those members, Charles Mukora of Kenya, also was  
implicated in the Salt Lake case and has resigned. The other member 
was identified as Francis Nyangweso of Uganda. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said it was ``safe to assume'' his commission was now  
looking at member involvement with the Sydney bid. 
</P>
<P>
	He also expects to look at the failed 1996 bid of Toronto, where  
officials said Thursday they spent more than $500,000 to cover the 
cost of IOC members breaking or stretching rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would imagine that they would now come forward with names  
and details,'' Pound said. 
</P>
<P>
	And he said the IOC investigation of Salt Lake remained open,  
based on a full review of reports from the independent Utah ethics 
panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said he had no information on Austin Sealey, an IOC member  
from Barbados who was identified in Friday's Washington Post as a 
possible recipient of money from Salt Lake that was not evident in 
initial reviews. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake Tribune, meanwhile, said investigators had  
subpoenaed University of Utah records of Bold Magvan, a son of IOC 
member Shagdarjav Magvan of Mongolia. 
</P>
<P>
	In Paris, Jean-Claude Ganga of the Republic of Congo said he had  
40 members who would vote to reinstate him to the IOC at a special 
assembly in March. Pound said such a reversal probably would force 
the ruling executive board, of which he is a member, to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would be a serious point of non-confidence,'' Pound said.  
He said he would be ``very surprised'' if the expulsions were 
overturned. 
</P>
<P>
	When he announced the expulsions, IOC president Juan Antonio  
Samaranch said all bid cities from the 1996 Games onward would be 
asked to identify members who acted improperly in the bidding. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said those letters were to be mailed from IOC headquarters  
in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Friday, with a Feb. 16 deadline to 
reply, about two weeks later than originally intended but still in 
time for the investigations to be finished by the special session 
March 17-18. 
</P>
<P>
	And in another of the six investigations of Olympic bidding  
around the world, the U.S. Olympic Committee said the report of its 
special inquiry on Salt Lake, led by former Senate Majority Leader 
George Mitchell, would be released March 1. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--USA Today said Ganga and former Salt Lake Olympics chief Tom  
Welch shared a bank account. Welch's lawyer, Tom Schaffer, said 
Welch's name was on the account so he could get funds for Ganga if 
Ganga was out of the country. Welch, the lawyer added, never made a 
deposit or withdrawal from the account. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ganga told the French newspaper Liberation that Samaranch was  
sacrificing friends in the scandal to try to clear his own name. 
</P>
<P>
	--Samaranch resigned as president of La Caixa, Spain's  
fourth-largest bank. The 78-year-old IOC president said he was 
leaving because of his age, not the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	--Sergio Santander, expelled from the IOC in the Salt Lake case,  
was suspended as president of the Chilean Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	--Two proprietors of a defunct Salt Lake escort service told the  
Tribune their escorts entertained IOC members at hotels during 
visits in 1995. They did not say who paid for the escorts. 
</P>
<P>
	--A Browning rifle given to Samaranch by Salt Lake organizers is  
worth much more than the $671 listed, KTVX in Salt Lake reported. 
Leon Burrows, who designed the gun's engraving, told the TV station 
the gun could sell for up to $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Olympics' top TV organizer, Manolo Romero, reportedly was  
paid $1.5 million for his services during the 1992 Barcelona Games. 
Spanish sports authorities defended Barcelona's finances against 
the report in the newspaper El Mundo.

<HEADLINE> Man Guilty of Killing Park Ranger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRYSON CITY, N.C. (AP) -- A federal jury on Saturday convicted a  
man who shot to death one ranger and tried to kill another at the 
Great Smoky Mountains National Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeremiah Locust Sr., 47, will be sentenced within 60 days to a  
mandatory life sentence without parole. He was convicted of 
first-degree murder and attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Ranger Joseph Kolodski was killed June 21 while investigating a  
report of a man walking along the Blue Ridge Parkway with a gun. He 
was shot as he stepped out of his vehicle. The gunman shot out the 
windshield of another ranger who had arrived at the scene shortly 
after the shooting. The other ranger was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Kolodski, 36, was the park's first ranger killed in the line of  
duty. The government at first sought a death penalty, but dropped 
the request Saturday without explanation. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers had claimed Locust's below-average mental  
ability, complications from diabetes and drinking of several beers 
impaired him the day of the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things weren't operating right in his mind that day,'' Stephen  
Lindsay said in closing arguments Friday. ``This is about a good 
man who is mentally challenged, peaceful and honest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors contended Locust went to the parkway intent on  
venting his angry over problems at home. Locust had time to leave 
the parkway after rangers began arriving but stayed around instead 
to shoot him, prosecutors claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wasn't the blind, staggering drunk they're trying to sell  
you,'' Jerry Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Locust, a gardener and maintenance worker in Cherokee, showed no  
emotion when the verdicts were read. His wife was in tears, as were 
some members of the Eastern Band of the Cherokee tribe, of which 
Locust is a member.

	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- Yevgeny Kafelnikov, holding the  
Australian Open trophy high, smiled broadly and thanked Pete 
Sampras for staying home. Kafelnikov, sidelined by strange 
accidents the past two years, only had to keep his body intact this 
time to capture a weakened men's tournament Sunday and gain a 
second Grand Slam title. Kafelnikov's steady baseline play gave him 
a 4-6, 6-0, 6-3, 7-6 (7-1) victory over an unusually error-prone 
Thomas Enqvist, who double faulted for the seventh time on match

by Monday's powerful earthquake have been boarding buses, pickup 
trucks and even horse-drawn carriages to leave this hard-hit town. 
Many are frustrated with the government's disorganized effort to 
restore order and give out relief supplies. Meanwhile, Colombia's 
Planning Department says residents who have to move or rebuild 
their homes will be eligible for housing grants and low-interest 
government loans. At least 940 people were killed in the 
earthquake. Hundreds more remain missing.

	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- NATO authorized its secretary-general  
to launch military action in Yugoslavia if the warring parties do 
not negotiate an agreement for autonomy in Kosovo. On Saturday, the 
United States and five European nations gave Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic and Kosovo's ethnic Albanians a week to start 
negotiations and another two weeks to agree on ``substantial 
autonomy'' for the southern province of Serbia. They also backed 
the demand with the threat of NATO force. The Clinton 
administration welcomed NATO's move to force peace talks in 
Yugoslavia, but said it was not ready to commit troops to any 
international peacekeeping force in the region.

from intimate details of her sexual relationship with the 
president. Her closed, videotaped deposition on Monday will be the

	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The U.N. Security Council approved the  
first modest step to break the diplomatic logjam over Iraq on 
Saturday, agreeing to establish panels to assess Iraqi disarmament 
and adherence to other U.N. resolutions. The agreement was the 
first formal council action on Iraq since last month's U.S. and 
British airstrikes shattered the council's uneasy unity and 
deepened divisions over how to resume oversight of Iraq's weapons 
programs. The panels are to study Iraqi adherence on disarmament, 
humanitarian issues, looted Kuwaiti property and the status of 
Kuwaitis missing since Iraq's 1990 occupation of the country.

<HEADLINE> Boesel Replaces Tracy for Starter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Raul Boesel, whose full-time ride is in the  
Indy Racing League, has been signed to replace Paul Tracy in the 
season-opening race for the rival CART series. 
</P>
<P>
	Tracy was suspended from the March 21 opener at Homestead, Fla.,  
by CART following a rough drive during the race in Australia last 
October. 
</P>
<P>
	The race will represent a homecoming of sorts for Boesel, who  
drove for Team Green in 1996 and finished 22nd in the CART 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we're extremely disappointed Paul won't be driving for  
us at Homestead, we're fortunate to have a driver of Raul's talent 
and experience available,'' said Barry Green, owner of Team KOOL 
Green. ``He's very well liked by everyone on the team. Through no 
fault of Raul, we didn't have the best of seasons together in 1996, 
so we're looking forward to giving him a competitive and reliable 
package.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilian driver will be teamed for the first time with  
Scotsman Dario Franchitti, the other Team Green driver. 
</P>
<P>
	``Raul's a perfect choice,'' said Tracy, who has signed a  
three-year contract extension despite a disappointing and sometimes 
frustrating first year with Team Green. ``He's a great all around 
driver, but some of his best performances have come on ovals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given his experience with the team, he should go well at  
Homestead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boesel, a former world sports car driving champion who also has  
run 169 CART races, is scheduled to test at Homestead from Monday 
through Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tracy is scheduled to be back in the seat of the Reynard-Honda  
for the second event of the 20-race season, April 10 in Japan.

<HEADLINE> States Ponder Fed Role in Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's education proposals sound  
awfully familiar to California lawmaker Kerry Mazzoni. Since last 
year, no school in her state can simply promote a failing student, 
a restraint Clinton would like to see nationwide. And this year, 
California lawmakers will seek millions for teacher training and 
state power to close failing schools -- also on Clinton's latest 
national wish list. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're doing much of the work. We're ahead of much of the  
work,'' said Mazzoni, a Democratic assemblywoman who chairs the 
education committee. ``The degree to which they can allow us to 
operate without strings will reflect the degree to which we will be 
successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As states and districts push forward with plans to ensure that  
tax dollars give children a good education, educators are divided 
over whether Clinton's proposals will help or hinder them. 
</P>
<P>
	``States are pretty much driving this vehicle, not the federal  
government,'' said Chris Pipho, a spokesman for the Education 
Commission of the States, a bipartisan alliance that Clinton 
chaired when he was governor of Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's proposals are ``more of a bully pulpit,'' Pipho said.  
</P>
<P>
	The president has promised to seek budget funds and send  
Congress a bill to ensure that: schools stop promoting students who 
are failing, teachers are qualified to teach subjects they are 
assigned, states fix or shut low-performing schools, parents get 
annual report cards on schools' performance, and schools maintain 
disciplined classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would tie the more than $15 billion states get from the  
federal education budget to those goals, Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Education Department so far has no specifics about how  
it would work. And some states are crying foul, said James A. 
Watts, of the Atlanta-based Southern Regional Education Board 
research group. 
</P>
<P>
	``There should not be a common prescription for all 50 states  
any more than a state should have a common prescription for all its 
districts,'' said Watts. ``Federal support can make a difference. 
But states can do the diagnoses and decide for themselves how to 
use those resources.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least 48 states and nearly 40 large city districts already  
have so-called accountability systems. But they vary. Thirty-six 
states issue school report cards, which grade performance like a 
student report card. But only 16 states give themselves the 
authority to shut down or takeover a failing school. 
</P>
<P>
	New York has closed three schools, Oklahoma closed two and, and  
Texas and New Mexico state authorities have overhauled 50 others, 
according to a recent survey, although no states have taken over 
schools from their districts. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if a federal remedy is needed, it's unlikely Clinton's plan  
would win necessary votes from the Republican-controlled Congress 
or support from Republican governors, who believe the president is 
attempting to get political mileage out of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional Republicans have rejected nearly all of Clinton's  
education proposals since he was elected president. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question is, are they going to reflexively recoil, or are  
they going to work with Clinton to advance a substantial 
proposal?'' asks Andrew Rotherham, who heads a schools project at 
the Democratic Leadership Council, also once chaired by Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Kati Haycock, director of Education Trust, which lobbies to  
improve student achievement, believes the federal role should 
actually be stronger to prod the states lagging behind. States 
moved slowly on federal requirements to account for student 
progress under a 1994 law, she notes. 
</P>
<P>
	But Anna Cowan, a Republican lawmaker in Florida who chairs the  
state senate education committee, says the devil is in the details, 
``and the details are best handled at the local level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Social promotion, for example, is one goal that is so thorny  
that many states don't include it in overhauls, and only six states 
tie promotions to test scores. 
</P>
<P>
	Some states have tried to end the practice of allowing students  
to advance a grade before mastering grade-level skills: California, 
for example, last year provided $115 million to help the students 
who are falling behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best thing the federal government can do is have a  
national expectation of standards and be a clearinghouse for what 
works well,'' said Mazzoni. ``Anything else complicates the work of 
the states.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton's five education goals for states, and the  
status of states' efforts: 
</P>
<P>
	--End schools' social promotion of students and help students  
meet promotion standards on time: 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-six states have or will put in place this year exams tied  
to high school graduation; six states tie promotion to testing. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Ensure teachers are qualified to teach subjects they are  
assigned, through competency tests and professional development: 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-one states have adopted standards that new teachers would  
have to meet to earn a license; 15 states measure what those new 
teachers know in their subject areas. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Help states, through a $200 million budget request, to  
identify low-performing schools and fix or shut them down: 
</P>
<P>
	Nineteen states rating school performance make some money and  
support available to low-performing schools; 11 states make that 
help mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Issue annual report cards on schools' performances to parents:  
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-six states have annual school report cards; 13 states  
require report cards to be sent home to parents. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Require that states and districts maintain discipline policies  
for classrooms: 
</P>
<P>
	Seventeen states include safety or discipline data on their  
school report cards; 28 states and the Virgin Islands allow or call 
for districts to establish discipline policies that include 
corporal punishment.

<HEADLINE> Dan Reeves Shows Range of Emotions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The fiery temper is still there. When Dan Reeves is  
angry, the veins in his neck bulge to their limits, his forehead 
and cheeks assuming the rosy complexion of a barely cooked piece of 
meat. 
</P>
<P>
	The icy glare has lost none of its bite. The jaw tightens and  
the squinty eyelids pull even closer together, zeroing in on their 
target with a scrutiny and condemnation that cuts straight to the 
soul. 
</P>
<P>
	But this season, after a doctor cut open his chest and fixed his  
ailing heart, Reeves could no longer conceal the side of him that 
few people ever saw. 
</P>
<P>
	He cried. He danced. He showed he was human.  
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't embarrass me at all,'' the Atlanta Falcons coach  
said Friday at his final news conference before Sunday's Super Bowl 
against the Broncos. ``I'm not ashamed that my emotions came out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves -- who was ``hell'' to play for in Denver, according to  
John Elway -- has gained the unwavering admiration of his team and 
city in only two years with the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost to a man, he is cited as the reason this bedraggled  
franchise, with only seven winning seasons before he arrived, finds 
itself in the Super Bowl for the first time in 33 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time I see him, I just want to thank him for what he  
means to this team,'' receiver Terance Mathis said. ``This is a guy 
who had his chest opened up. He had a quadruple bypass surgery and 
three weeks later, he's on the sidelines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves was standing on the sideline during a Dec. 13 game in New  
Orleans when a burning sensation pierced his chest and throat. No, 
no, no, he thought. Not now, not during one of the best seasons of 
his life. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons were on their way to the playoffs and trying to wrap  
up their first NFC West title in 18 years when Reeves' heart began 
to shut down. Two arteries totally clogged, another almost. He was 
drawing perilously close to a major heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
	He tried to brush it off, tried to tell himself it was nothing  
serious. But, having gone through two heart procedures during the 
early '90s as coach of the Broncos, he mentioned his pain to the 
team physician, and less than 24 hours later, he was on the 
operating table. 
</P>
<P>
	``You go into it just like you do a game,'' the 55-year-old  
Reeves said matter of factly. ``You expect to win. That's the way I 
went into surgery -- everything's going to be fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four days later, he endured a gut-wrenching news conference,  
tears pouring down his face. Four weeks later, he was back on the 
sideline for a playoff victory over San Francisco. Another week 
more, he was standing atop a podium in the middle of the Metrodome, 
flapping his arms in a hapless but charming attempt to do the 
``Dirty Bird'' dance after the Falcons' improbable victory over the 
Vikings in the NFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	His softer side revealed, about the only thing missing in  
Reeves' life is a Super Bowl victory as a head coach. Three times, 
he took the Broncos to the title game; three times, they were 
routed, the scores getting worse each time. 
</P>
<P>
	``You would like to be the best,'' said Reeves, the winningest  
active coach in the NFL, eighth overall with a 162-117-1 record. 
``It would certainly make me feel a heck of a lot better, but as 
far as my coaching career goes ... my record speaks for itself. If 
I don't get a Super Bowl win, it won't be because I didn't try.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves has built his life around a few simple concepts --  
loyalty, organization, discipline and competitiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	He's hot-tempered but compassionate, rigid but forgiving. He  
rarely holds grudges -- Elway and Mike Shanahan not withstanding -- 
and his devilish wit caught many players off guard when he came to 
the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing I can say about Dan that people don't realize, he's  
not the uptight coach that people think,'' defensive end Chuck 
Smith said. ``I know he's an old, middle-aged white guy in his 50s, 
but he's laid back. He's funny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Americus (Ga.) High School, Reeves was a skinny option  
quarterback who garnered little interest from colleges. After 
agreeing to play for South Carolina, he was MVP of the state's high 
school all-star game in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly, he found himself in demand. Georgia, Georgia Tech and  
Florida called with scholarship offers, but Reeves stuck by his 
commitment to South Carolina, impressed by the candor of coach 
Marvin Bass. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took a chance on you when no one else wanted you,'' Bass  
told Reeves. ``There are no guarantees you will start. I've got six 
quarterbacks. But if you're the best, you'll get the job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves set 10 school records for the Gamecocks and revealed at a  
tender age that he was a coach-in-the-making. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knew everything,'' said Bass, who now works for Reeves as a  
special assistant. ``We started out calling plays for him, but we 
quit because he was doing such a good job on his own. He's a 
natural. They come along once in a lifetime, guys like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves wasn't drafted by the pros, but Gil Brandt recognized  
something special. Aware of the loyalty shown to South Carolina and 
impressed by Reeves' all-around skills, Brandt signed him to a 
free-agent contract and found a place for him in the Dallas 
backfield. 
</P>
<P>
	``His family brought him up the right way,'' said Brandt, the  
Cowboys' longtime director of player personnel. ``There's certain 
values that were instilled in him. He got the utmost out of his 
ability and he got the utmost out of his teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves spent 16 years in Dallas -- first as a player, then as a  
player-coach, finally as an assistant coach. 
</P>
<P>
	His competitive battles with roommate Mike Ditka were legendary,  
spilling off the field to everything from darts to backgammon. 
Though Reeves was raised in the segregated South, he developed a 
unique bond with black players -- ``a blue-eyed soul brother,'' 
Brandt quipped. Most important, Reeves learned at the knee of 
Dallas' icy coach, Tom Landry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am a proud son,'' Reeves said. ``I don't know that I've ever  
been around anybody that was more organized or got their football 
team more prepared than coach Landry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 33, Reeves had a chance to return to his home-state team as a  
head coach. He interviewed with the Atlanta Falcons in 1977, but 
wasn't impressed by the part-time practice facility at a city park 
and the weight room with a dirt floor. He decided to remain in 
Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years later, another team called; this time, he accepted.  
</P>
<P>
	Following in the popular footsteps of Red Miller, who had taken  
Denver to its first Super Bowl, Reeves wasted little time carving 
out his own Rocky Mountain niche. In 1983, he arranged the trade to 
get Elway. The following year, he added Shanahan, an unknown 
college coach, to his staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Super Bowls later, those three men would be at the center  
of a feud that still reverberates. After the '91 season, stung by 
criticism from Elway and suspecting that Shanahan was plotting with 
the quarterback behind his back, Reeves fired his most trusted 
assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	A year later, Reeves himself was dismissed by the Broncos.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's still a lot of hurt that won't ever go away,'' he  
admitted in the days leading up to the Super Bowl. ``You never 
forget those things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After four years as coach of the New York Giants, Reeves was  
fired again. The Falcons quickly hired the coach they had failed to 
land two decades earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's more than just an Xs and Os coach. He's an organization  
builder,'' Falcons president Taylor Smith said. ``From the football 
players to everybody involved in it, you can see how he won all the 
games he has. He has a special way with all the people around 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born in the north Georgia town of Rome, raised on a south  
Georgia farm in Americus, Reeves is finally back home again. This 
time, he has no intention of leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	``My wife will not go with me if we move again, and I'm not  
planning on leaving her,'' said Reeves, who has been married to 
Pam, his high school sweetheart, for 33 years. ``This should be the 
last place I go.''

<HEADLINE> Boxer Is In Critical Condition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- A boxer was in critical condition Saturday with  
a blood clot on the brain after being knocked out by the IBF's No. 
1 junior flyweight contender. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernando Ibarra of Laredo, Texas, was knocked out by Ratanachai  
Vorapin of Thailand in the sixth round of a scheduled eight-rounder 
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Ibarra was taken to Saint Louis University Hospital after he  
stopped breathing and lost his pulse in the dressing room. 
Neurosurgeons performed procedures to relieve pressure on the 
brain. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has a blood clot on the surface of his brain caused by a  
blow to his head,'' said a joint statement by Dr. Kenneth Smith 
Jr., chief of neurosurgery, and Dr. Joseph Sherrill, assistant 
professor of surgery and Ibarra's attending physician. ``This is a 
very serious injury, and it will require several days to determine 
the extent of his recovery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith has expertise in head injuries caused by boxing.  
</P>
<P>
	Ibarra regained consciousness shortly after hitting the canvas  
and was led away from the ring. But sitting in his dressing room 
later, Ibarra became unresponsive, said Tim Lueckenhoff, 
administrator of the Missouri Office of Athletics, which oversees 
boxing in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he left, he knew everything that was going on,'' Dr. Al  
Sandler, the ringside physician, said. ``He said everything felt 
OK. He walked back to the dressing room and another fight went on. 
</P>
<P>
	``After that fight, I was called back to the dressing room. I  
looked at his eyes and said, `Call 911 as fast as you can.' Then he 
stopped breathing and had no pulse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sandler revived Ibarra.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was a one-punch knockout,'' Lueckenhoff said. ``He took one  
punch square on the jaw and he was out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fight was the second of five on a card at a downtown hotel.  
</P>
<P>
	Vorapin has a 30-3 record. Ibarra, listed in the fight's program  
as the Spanish champion, is 14-6.

<HEADLINE> Christopher Reeve Visits Vail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VAIL, Colo. (AP) -- For Christopher Reeve, once an avid skier, it  
hurt to return to Vail for the first time since his paralyzing 
horseback riding accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I first got here, I arrived in my room and looked at the  
slopes, and I had to take a minute to readjust,'' said Reeve, who 
competed in a celebrity race last time he visited Vail. ``Now, I'm 
having a very good time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Proceeds from this year's Bailey's American Ski Classic, the  
event he was part of in 1995, are going to the Christopher Reeve 
Foundation, which is dedicated to supporting research to find a 
cure for spinal cord paralysis. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been tremendous breakthroughs recently, and there  
is tremendous reason for hope,'' said Reeve. ``I may not be able to 
ski again right away, but it certainly is not outside the realm of 
possibility.''

<HEADLINE> Texas Football Is Back in Spotlight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) -- As the nation gets another helping of West  
Texas high school football via MTV Films' rancorous movie ``Varsity 
Blues,'' small-town coaches are beginning to wonder why they rate 
such a negative reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	The folks who live and die beneath the Friday night lights can't  
help but ask: ``Is that how we really seem?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If that's really what people see when they come down here,  
they need to check their glasses,'' said Snyder coach David Baugh, 
who has coached in West Texas for more than three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``Varsity Blues'' features Jon Voight as sadistic football coach  
Bud Kilmer, who rules the fictional town of West Canaan with all of 
the bluster and fury of a dictator. 
</P>
<P>
	In one scene, Kilmer forces a tackle to play while injured and  
threatens to ruin players' lives when they challenge his authority. 
</P>
<P>
	Teen heartthrob James Van Der Beek plays quarterback Jonathan  
Moxon, the only player with the guts to stand up to Kilmer's 
tyranny. 
</P>
<P>
	What follows is nearly two hours of crazed sexual hijinks and  
drunkenness as the teens rebel against the pressure of the 
football-mad town. 
</P>
<P>
	The film clearly makes some of the same points as H.G. ``Buzz''  
Bissinger's best-selling 1991 book ``Friday Night Lights,'' which 
detailed the intense rivalry between Odessa Permian and Odessa 
High. 
</P>
<P>
	When the book hit the shelves, coaches at Odessa Permian stayed  
up all night reading it, irate over what they felt was 
mischaracterization on Bissinger's part. The book portrayed coaches 
as manipulative at best and despot-like at worst. 
</P>
<P>
	Big Spring coach Dwight Butler said watching clips of ``Varsity  
Blues,'' like reading ``Friday Night Lights,'' is like looking in a 
funhouse mirror. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just topsy-turvy and distorted,'' said Butler. ``I'm  
not saying that nothing bad ever happens, I'm just surprised that 
these folks from up north can find out so much about it when I've 
never seen any of it. West Texas football is about coaches helping 
players be the best they can be, on and off the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Odessa Permian coach Randy Mayes blames stereotypes.  
</P>
<P>
	``Things get overblown,'' said Mayes, whose game with crosstown  
rival Odessa High drew 20,000 people this year. ``The truth is 
always somewhere in the middle and when people start writing books 
and things, everything gets out of proportion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Odessa High quarterback Rick Leach said the characterization of  
West Texas football is ``all bad with none of the good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many fans objected to the film's depiction of obnoxious hordes  
of hicks living vicariously through the boys on the field, but 
others say those who complain are just shooting the messenger. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the ugly truth,'' said Odessa Permian fan Ken Martinez.  
``This is the kind of pressure we put on kids when thousands of 
people base so much on a game. I played football and I can vouch 
for the fact that there are coaches that make that guy seem like a 
daisy. West Texas football is out of control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not surprisingly, Butler has a different theory.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's because we've got the best football by far, the best  
coaches and the best schools,'' Butler said. ``People always look 
to pick on the people who have better than themselves. Evidently, 
whoever wrote (``Varsity Blues'') was probably a frustrated athlete 
who never got his day on the field.''

<HEADLINE> Butyrskaya Leads Russians to Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- Maria Butyrskaya, leading two  
younger teammates, gave Russia another medals sweep today in the 
European Figure Skating Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian skaters have won all four European titles three years in  
a row. Their last loss was in the men's event in 1996, when 
Viatcheslav Zagarodniuk of Ukraine upset two Russians. 
</P>
<P>
	Butyrskaya, the defending champion, was far ahead of the field  
with an elegant routine to a piano concerto. She landed seven 
triple jumps with only a slight mistake at the end marring her 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	Still she scored marks of 5.8 and 5.9 for presentation to hold  
onto to her title. 
</P>
<P>
	Julia Soldatova and Viktoria Volchkova, just out of junior  
ranks, were second and third. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17-year-old Soldatova also did seven triples but without the  
style of Butyrskaya. 
</P>
<P>
	Volchkova, 16 and making her international debut in senior  
competition, started impressively with five solid triples in the 
first half of her routine. But, weakened by the flu, she made three 
mistakes in a row and switched positions with Soldatova. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian might have gone 1-2-3-4-5 if allowed more than three  
entries. Left off the squad this year was two-time European 
champion Irina Slutskaya and Yelena Sokolova, who won two Grand 
Prix events. 
</P>
<P>
	Even without Olympic champion Ilya Kulik, the Russian men are  
equally strong, easily winning all the medals. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexei Yagudin won an winner-take all free skating over  
teammates Yevgeny Plushenko and Alexei Urmanov, the 1994 Olympic 
champion making a comeback.

<HEADLINE> Brunson Sets NCAA 60-Meter Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) -- Marcus Brunson, in his first race for  
Arizona State after transferring from Wyoming, broke the NCAA 
60-meter indoor record Saturday with a 6.46-second clocking at the 
Flagstaff Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
	Brunson, son of former Arizona State football player Michael  
Brunson, broke the old record of 6.50 set by Lee McRae of 
Pittsburgh on March 7, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Brunson's fellow sophomore Tony Berrain broke Herman Frazier's  
21-year-old school record in the 400 at 46.29. Frazier, now Arizona 
State's senior associate athletic director and president of the 
Fiesta Bowl, ran 46.48 in 1978.

<HEADLINE> Super Bowl Matchups at a Glance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                           *DAVE GOLDBERG   	
</P>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Matchups for the Super Bowl between the Denver  
Broncos and Atlanta Falcons: 

</P>
<P>
                    *When the Falcons have the ball*    	
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta's attack works off the running of Jamal Anderson (32),  
which sets up the passing of Chris Chandler (12) to Tony Martin 
(80), Terance Mathis (81) and tight end O.J. Santiago (88). 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson was second in the NFL with 1,846 yards rushing. But  
running can be a daunting task against the Broncos, who allowed a 
total of only 27 yards rushing in playoff victories over the Jets 
and Dolphins. Only four teams ran for more than 100 yards against 
them during the regular season and only Gary Brown of the Giants 
and Corey Dillon of the Bengals had more than 100. That's a little 
deceptive -- Denver jumped off to early leads in most of its games, 
forcing opponents to abandon the run. 
</P>
<P>
	The heart of the run defense are the three linebackers, John  
Mobley (51) and Bill Romanowski (53) on the outside, and Glenn 
Cadrez (59) in the middle. Safeties Steve Atwater (27) and Tyrone 
Braxton (34) and the two defensive tackles, Trevor Pryce (93) and 
Keith Traylor (94), also play the run well. 
</P>
<P>
	That puts a major load on the Atlanta offensive line, which has  
been transformed by line coach Art Shell from run-and-shoot pass 
blockers to run blockers. The best and most experienced is left 
tackle Bob Whitfield (70), one of just two first-round draft picks 
in Atlanta's starting lineup. Center Robbie Tobeck (61) is a 
converted guard and left guard Calvin Collins (68) is a converted 
center. Right tackle Emphraim Salaam (74) is a rookie picked in the 
seventh round of last April's draft. 
</P>
<P>
	If Chandler has time, he should be able to throw successfully  
against a Denver secondary that hasn't been as good as it was last 
season. Ray Crockett (39) is the best cover man, with Darrien 
Gordon (21) on the other side. But most important will be the 
pressure put on Chandler by Denver's ends, Neil Smith (90) and Maa 
Tanuvasa, plus Alfred Williams (91), who plays on passing downs. 
One statistic to remember: Chandler was the best fourth-quarter 
passer in the NFL this season. 

</P>
<P>
                    *When the Broncos have the ball*    	
</P>
<P>
	Despite the presence of future Hall of Fame quarterback John  
Elway (7), the Broncos run first, then pass. Terrell Davis (30) ran 
for 2,008 yards, only the fourth NFL player ever to pass 2,000, and 
was brilliant in last year's Super Bowl, earning the MVP award by 
running for 157 yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	The key to stopping Davis for Atlanta will be middle linebacker  
Jessie Tuggle, a five-time Pro Bowler in his 12 seasons on bad 
Atlanta teams. But Tuggle has a lot of help, most of it from very 
good but little-known colleagues like Chuck Smith (90), who has 
earned a reputation as a pass rusher but is equally adept against 
the run, along with Travis Hall (98), Lester Archambeau (91) and 
Shane Dronett (75). Linebacker Cornelius Bennett (97), who played 
in four Super Bowls with Buffalo, has bounced back the last two 
seasons after looking ready for retirement in his first season in 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver's offensive line is one of the game's best.  
</P>
<P>
	Left tackle Tony Jones (77) and center Tom Nalen (66) are the  
two linchpins. Left guard Mark Schlereth (69) has undergone a dozen 
operations and plays as if he's never had one. One problem: There's 
not much depth there, so all must stay healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway has three top-flight receivers, Ed McCaffrey (87), Rod  
Smith (80) and tight end Shannon Sharpe (84), all over 6 feet 
against an Atlanta secondary that's not particularly big. The 
Falcons' best corner, Ray Buchanan (34), is 5-9, but played a major 
part in shutting down 6-4 Randy Moss in the NFC championship game 
two weeks ago. Only Michael Booker (20), who alternates with Ronnie 
Bradford (23) at the other corner, is over 6 feet. Randy Fuller 
(29) often blitzes off the corner on passing downs. 
</P>
<P>
	But the key to the secondary are the safeties, William White  
(35) and Eugene Robinson (41), who between them have 25 seasons of 
NFL experience, most of it elsewhere. Robinson, the free safety, is 
in his third straight Super Bowl -- the last two were with Green 
Bay. 

</P>
<P>
                          *Special Teams*    	
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta has the most explosive returner in rookie Tim Dwight  
(83). He also serves as a third-down receiver, completed one of two 
passes for 22 yards, and against Minnesota ran three times for 28 
yards, once lining up as quarterback in the shotgun. Dwight had a 
93-yard kickoff return for a touchdown against Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon returns punts for Denver, and has returned eight for  
touchdowns during his six seasons with the Chargers and Broncos, 
three in 1997. He averaged 11.1 yards a return this season but 
didn't score. Vaughn Hebron (22) returns kickoffs and had a 95-yard 
return for a touchdown against Miami, the first by a Bronco in 26 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The placekickers are among the best in the game.  
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta's Morten Andersen (5) is second all time in field goals  
made, while Denver's Jason Elam (1) tied the NFL record with a 
63-yarder this season and was perfect until late in the season. 
Both will be a little out of their elements here -- Andersen has 
kicked indoors for his entire 17-year career, first in New Orleans 
and then Atlanta, and Elam is helped by the mile high elevation in 
Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Stryzinski (4), Atlanta's punter, is not a long distance  
man, but he is adept at dropping the ball inside the 20. Denver's 
Tom Rouen (16) is more straight away -- he averaged 46.7 yards, a 
career best, this season, but just 14 of his 66 punts were inside 
the 20. 
</P>
<P>
	One possible problem for Denver is the long snapper, Cadrez, one  
of the few regulars in the NFL to handle long-snapping duties. He 
had two bad snaps in the AFC title game against the Jets. Atlanta's 
Adam Schreiber (67) is a career long-snapper, although he also can 
fill in on the offensive line if necessary. 

</P>
<P>
                            *Coaching*    	
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta coach Dan Reeves hired Mike Shanahan as an assistant in  
Denver, then fired him when he thought Shanahan and Elway were 
consorting behind his back. Reeves was fired himself a year later 
in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	But that was just media fodder for a duel of two of the NFL's  
best coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves, who had quadruple heart bypass surgery just six weeks  
ago, is in his ninth Super Bowl as player, assistant coach or head 
coach. He's lost all three as a head man, with Denver in 1987, 1988 
and 1990. His strength is his ability to motivate, particularly for 
one game, but he often gets conservative with a lead -- rushing 
continually to run out the clock. But he's taken less of a hand in 
game strategy; two of his assistants, defensive coordinator Rich 
Brooks and offensive line coach Art Shell, are former NFL head 
coaches. Reeves now delegates a lot of his offensive strategy to 
Jack Burns, the quarterbacks coach and 45-year-old backup 
quarterback Steve DeBerg (17), who returned to the field this 
season after serving as a coach for Reeves with the Giants in 1995 
and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan is regarded as one of the NFL's most innovative  
offensive minds and both his coordinators, Gary Kubiak on offense 
and Greg Robinson on defense, are regarded as future head coaches. 
Shanahan is also an outstanding motivator, keeping the Broncos up 
this year when most teams let down after winning Super Bowls. 

</P>
<P>
 *Intangibles*    	
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons, the first dome team in a Super Bowl, have played  
their last nine games indoors. Reeves says they'll be happy to be 
outdoors (on grass supplied by a company owned by golfer Greg 
Norman). 
</P>
<P>
	But that also could work against the Falcons if it gets too hot  
in Miami, particularly with defensive starters who are an average 
of 30 years old. The heat may have affected Denver in its loss to 
Miami at Pro Player Stadium on Dec. 21, a defeat they avenged 19 
days later in Denver by beating the Dolphins 38-3. That game in 
Miami was played at night, starting two hours later than the Super 
Bowl, which will begin at 6:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver has far more Super Bowl experience than the Falcons --  
most of its players were in this game last season. Atlanta, on the 
other hand, has only four players who have been in Super Bowls -- 
Bennett (four with Buffalo), Robinson (two with Green Bay), Martin 
(one with San Diego) and Fuller (one with Pittsburgh). Only 
Robinson has been on a winner, the 1997 Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	Two more things.  
</P>
<P>
	This will probably be Elway's final game. Will the Broncos be  
more motivated to send him out with a victory or will they be 
satisfied with last year's win? 
</P>
<P>
	And will Atlanta, 3-13 just two seasons ago, be happy just to be  
here?

<HEADLINE> Evric Gray Released From Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Washington Wizards forward Evric Gray was  
discharged from a Philadelphia hospital Saturday after he was 
injured during an exhibition game Friday night against the 76ers. 
</P>
<P>
	Wizards spokeswoman Maureen Lewis said Gray had returned home  
but was not expected to play in Saturday night's game, in which the 
Wizards hosted the 76ers. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray was knocked unconscious and cut on the head during a  
collision under the basket. He was admitted to Methodist Hospital 
in Philadelphia and received a CAT scan as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray was fouled by 76ers rookie Casey Shaw, whose elbow appeared  
to hit the top of Gray's head. Gray lay under the basket with his 
eyes closed for more than 10 minutes. He was fitted with a neck 
brace, and the top of his head was bandaged as he was lifted onto 
the stretcher.

<HEADLINE> CNN Appeals to Senators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Holding impeachment debates secretly is an  
affront to the First Amendment, CNN argues in urging the Senate to 
open all deliberations to the public's eye. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate twice went into secret session this week, once to  
debate a motion by Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., to dismiss the 
impeachment articles against President Clinton and again to discuss 
whether to call witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN made its argument in the form of a brief written by First  
Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams and delivered Friday to all 100 
senators and through full-page newspaper ads printed in USA Today, 
the Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
	``Conducting these debates behind closed doors denies people  
throughout the world the opportunity to judge the fairness of the 
proceedings and excludes firsthand information from being made 
available to the millions of American voters who have a vital stake 
in the trial's outcome,'' CNN argued in its ad. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN considered filing a lawsuit but concluded that since the  
Senate makes its own rules on the impeachment proceedings, no court 
would have jurisdiction, Abrams said. 
</P>
<P>
	The network wanted to add a legal argument to buttress the  
efforts of Sens. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, and Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., 
to open the proceedings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate voted 57-43 to keep debate over Byrd's motion secret.  
All except three Republicans favored the secret session and all 
except five Democrats, including Byrd, were opposed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate locked its doors and posted guards when it went into  
secret session, and members were threatened with expulsion if they 
disclose what went on. Deliberations in the impeachment trial of 
President Andrew Johnson in 1868 were also kept confidential, and 
closed sessions have routinely been held in impeachment proceedings 
against federal judges. 
</P>
<P>
	Abrams argued that the Johnson case should not be used as  
precedent, since First Amendment law on freedom of the press has 
largely been established in the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope the senators will pay close heed to their obligations  
to the Constitution,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Lamb, CEO of C-SPAN, sought to rally the news media to  
this cause in late December and said he was disappointed that more 
voices didn't join him. He said many senators are disingenuous in 
fighting to keep proceedings closed yet frequently making 
themselves available for television interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamb called CNN's effort a good step, but said senators listen  
more to their constituents than media organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on what we've seen so far, you can't be terribly  
optimistic,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Tenn. Celebrates Vols' Championship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Twenty-six days after winning the  
national title in the desert, the Tennessee Volunteers finally held 
a celebration on Saturday -- at home in the rain. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 1993, we said we would get to another level,'' said Phillip  
Fulmer, who took over as head coach that year. ``Well, I believe we 
are there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A sea of orange ponchos estimated at 35,000 to 40,000 cheered  
the winningest team in Tennessee history through a chilly rain at 
Neyland Stadium. The Vols finished 13-O with their Fiesta Bowl 
victory over Florida State on Jan. 4 in Tempe, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	The Neyland scoreboards flashed the outcome: UT 23, FSU 16.  
</P>
<P>
	The entire game was replayed on a giant Jumbotron, with retiring  
``Voice of the Vols'' broadcaster John Ward calling the action. The 
crowd roared like it was game day. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the stadium, at the intersection of Stadium Drive and  
Peyton Manning Pass, throngs awaited the team's customary ``Vol 
walk'' to the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not No. 5, not No. 4, No. 3, No. 2,'' a group of women  
dressed in orange and white from head to toe chanted. ``We're No. 
1. We are UT.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team ran onto the field through a gameday ``T'' formed by  
the Pride of the Southland marching band. Starters were introduced 
individually. Senior linebacker and co-captain Al Wilson was the 
last onto the field, and got the biggest cheer. 
</P>
<P>
	``On behalf of my teammates and the coaching staff and everybody  
that had something to do with our football team, I want to thank 
the fans for all your support and all the love and care you showed 
throughout my four years at the University of Tennessee,'' Wilson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really do appreciate it and hope that in the future we can  
be known for a championship at Tennessee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Proclamations and trophies greeted the team -- the national  
championship trophies from The Associated Press, the MacArthur Bowl 
National Championship Trophy and the Sears national trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	Knoxville, Knox County and the state of Tennessee all declared  
Saturday as the Vols' special day. ``You remind us that being a 
champion is within the grasp of everyone if you will work,'' Knox 
County Executive Tom Schumpert said. 
</P>
<P>
	National coach of the year awards were bestowed on Fulmer from  
the Football Writers of America and the American Football Coaches 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Fulmer, a Tennessee native, a former Vol lineman and a longtime  
Vols assistant coach, thanked the players, his assistants, the 
university administration and then the sea of orange around him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Especially, for all the fans that have stuck with us through  
thick and thin,'' he said. ``You are truly and will always be our 
12th man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And is if the fans needed an extra lift, Fulmer said, ``What a  
great 1998. And we already are looking forward to 1999.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Miss Universe Runs for Governor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Former Miss Universe Irene Saez says  
she's running for state governor, two months after her bid for 
Venezuela's presidency collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
	Saez, 37, told reporters Friday that she is officially a  
candidate in the March 14 governor's race in Nueva Esparta state, 
which includes the popular tourist destination, Margarita Island. 
The incumbent, Rafael Tovar, was re-elected in November but died 
after an operation three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of polls have been conducted and the support of the  
people of Nueva Esparta is impressive ... because I've shown how to 
manage a government and above all govern with honesty,'' said Saez. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1981 Miss Universe said the leftist Patriotic Pole coalition  
that helped former coup leader Hugo Chavez win the Dec. 6 
presidential race was backing her, though that could not be 
confirmed immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	For months, the 6-foot-1 blonde led polls for the presidential  
race, but her popularity ratings sank after she accepted the 
endorsement of a discredited traditional political party, the 
social Christian COPEI. 
</P>
<P>
	Saez gained a reputation as an honest and efficient politician  
while running Chacao municipality in Caracas, the richest 
municipality in the country. In 1995, she was re-elected with 96 
percent of the vote.

<HEADLINE> Food Fight Brings Criminal Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURGETTSTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- Some principals don't just call parents  
after a food fight in the school cafeteria. They call the cops. 
</P>
<P>
	The mother of a teen charged with disorderly conduct for tossing  
a single French fry thinks the get-tough policy goes too far. 
</P>
<P>
	Polly Skarupa said her 14-year-old son, Brett, who had no record  
of trouble at school, was punished enough by his parents and by a 
three-day suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	``Were there any fights or clothing ruined as a result?'' she  
said. ``He spent three days on in-school suspension, and he was 
punished at home. He paid for what he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The boy was sentenced on Thursday to 20 hours of community  
service. It probably didn't help his cause that the presiding judge 
is a former substitute teacher. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are two ways to look at this,'' District Justice Gary  
Havelka said. ``You can look at it as an isolated incident where 
one fry is thrown. On the other side, if you don't have a policy, 
the incidents become more rampant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mother of the Burgettstown Junior-Senior High School student  
will appeal to Washington County Court and the board of the 
Burgettstown Area School District, located about 25 miles west of 
Pittsburgh.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls For More Pay for Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Saturday he wants to  
spend $14 million to help close the gap between men's and women's 
wages, and he pressed Congress to toughen enforcement of equal pay 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``When a woman is denied equal pay, it doesn't just hurt her,''  
Clinton said in his weekly radio address. ``It hurts her family, 
and that hurts America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, the president's Council of Economic Advisers  
reported that women earn about 75 cents for every dollar a man 
earns -- an improvement from the 58 cents on the dollar that women 
earned when President Kennedy signed the 1964 Equal Pay Act. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can be proud of this progress, but 75 cents on the dollar  
is still only three-quarters of the way there, and Americans can't 
be satisfied until we're all the way there,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The $14 million proposal, part of the fiscal 2000 budget he will  
submit to Congress on Monday, would: 
</P>
<P>
	--Triple the number of enforcement workers at the Equal  
Employment Opportunity Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	--Provide technical assistance to employers on how to comply with  
equal pay laws. 
</P>
<P>
	--Create public service announcements alerting women to their  
rights. 
</P>
<P>
	As Labor Secretary Alexis Herman put it: ``I have yet to go to  
the grocery store to buy a $1 loaf of bread and have the cashier 
look up and say, 'Since you're a woman, it's 75 cents.' Working 
women pay the same -- and should be paid the same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the last several months, the Labor Department has stepped up  
its monitoring of pay disparities at private companies, forcing 
many to give raises to women doing the same work as men. 
</P>
<P>
	Just three weeks ago, Texaco Inc. agreed to pay $3.1 million to  
186 female employees in a settlement resulting from an audit by the 
Labor Department's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, 
which monitors affirmative action at companies that do business 
with the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton called on the new 106th Congress to pass, as one of its  
first acts this year, the Paycheck Fairness Act, which was 
introduced in the Senate by Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., 
and in the House by Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would allow women to sue their employers for  
unlimited compensatory and punitive damages, in addition to the 
limited damages and back-pay awards now available under federal law 
to remedy pay violations. Unlimited compensatory and punitive 
damages are already available for wage discrimination based on race 
and ethnicity. 
</P>
<P>
	The Daschle-DeLauro bill would also prohibit employers from  
punishing workers who share salary information and would increase 
training for Equal Employment Opportunity Commission workers who 
handle wage discrimination claims.

<HEADLINE> Broncos Test Footing at Stadium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- While crews put the finishing touches to the turf  
at Pro Player Stadium on Saturday, the Denver Broncos milled about, 
laughing and cavorting, in what was little more than a photo-op on 
the day before the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Running back Terrell Davis provided a few of the lighter moments  
during the team's 40-minute visit to the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	In the absence of a football, Davis grabbed a soda can, tucked  
it under his left arm and practiced running into the west end zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis also pulled out his camcorder and, making a 360-degree  
spin from the center of the field, started filming the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos normally have a brief walk-through of about 15 plays  
on the day before a game, but because of the number of workers and 
visitors in the stadium and the preparations that were still going 
on, the team mostly stood on the field and tested the footing. 
</P>
<P>
	All were in street clothes and only one, cornerback Darrius  
Johnson, wore his Broncos jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Mike Shanahan huddled with offensive coordinator Gary  
Kubiak and quarterback John Elway on the 30-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
	The end zones had already been painted before the visit, but a  
member of the grounds crew wielded a roller and was still applying 
a border of blue to a Broncos logo in front of the Denver bench.

<HEADLINE> Boxer Is In Critical Condition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- A boxer was in critical condition Saturday with  
a blood clot on the brain after being knocked out by the IBF's No. 
1 junior flyweight contender. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernando Ibarra of Laredo, Texas, was knocked out by Ratanachai  
Vorapin of Thailand in the sixth round of a scheduled eight-rounder 
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Ibarra was taken to Saint Louis University Hospital after he  
stopped breathing and lost his pulse in the dressing room. 
Neurosurgeons performed procedures to relieve pressure on the 
brain. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has a blood clot on the surface of his brain caused by a  
blow to his head,'' said a joint statement by Dr. Kenneth Smith 
Jr., chief of neurosurgery, and Dr. Joseph Sherrill, assistant 
professor of surgery and Ibarra's attending physician. ``This is a 
very serious injury, and it will require several days to determine 
the extent of his recovery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith has expertise in head injuries caused by boxing.  
</P>
<P>
	Ibarra regained consciousness shortly after hitting the canvas  
and was led away from the ring. But sitting in his dressing room 
later, Ibarra became unresponsive, said Tim Lueckenhoff, 
administrator of the Missouri Office of Athletics, which oversees 
boxing in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he left, he knew everything that was going on,'' Dr. Al  
Sandler, the ringside physician, said. ``He said everything felt 
OK. He walked back to the dressing room and another fight went on. 
</P>
<P>
	``After that fight, I was called back to the dressing room. I  
looked at his eyes and said, `Call 911 as fast as you can.' Then he 
stopped breathing and had no pulse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sandler revived Ibarra.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was a one-punch knockout,'' Lueckenhoff said. ``He took one  
punch square on the jaw and he was out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fight was the second of five on a card at a downtown hotel.  
</P>
<P>
	Vorapin has a 30-3 record. Ibarra, listed in the fight's program  
as the Spanish champion, is 14-6.

<HEADLINE> Marijuana Co-Op Founder Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WESTMINSTER, Calif. (AP) -- Marvin Chavez says he founded an  
Orange County medical marijuana co-op to help sick people. 
</P>
<P>
	But prosecutors called him ``a dope dealer, pure and simple,''  
and Chavez was sentenced Friday to six years in prison for selling 
marijuana to undercover police and mailing pot to a cancer patient. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of Chavez say he is a casualty of the war on drugs.  
</P>
<P>
	``His motivation is to help others in pain,'' said his defense  
attorney, J. David Nick, adding that Chavez gave marijuana to 
cancer sufferers, AIDS patients and others in need, accepting only 
voluntary donations in return. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's Proposition 215, passed in 1996, legalized  
possession, cultivation and use of cannabis for medical purposes, 
but not its sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Nick said Chavez, 42, would appeal the conviction and sentence.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Women Beat Portugal 6-0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Kristine Lilly scored two goals and  
Mia Hamm and Michelle Akers also scored to give the U.S. women's 
soccer team a 6-0 victory over Portugal in a friendly match 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team broke open the match with four second-half goals  
as Portugal gradually was worn down by constant U.S. pressure 
before a crowd of 5,152 at Lockhart Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	A final shot count of 38-1 dictated the U.S. dominance in its  
second of 19 matches leading to the Women's World Cup June 19-July 
10. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans led 2-0 at halftime, before Danielle Fotopoulos  
made it 3-0 when she connected deep inside the box in the 52nd 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Lilly scored her second goal of the match when she chipped in a  
shot from 18 yards out in the 71st minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Two minutes later, Hamm broke deep into the Portuguese goal and,  
on a give-and-go with Tisha Venturini, flicked in a shot from three 
yards out for her 103rd career goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Akers scored her 100th goal off a corner kick by Tiffeny  
Milbrett in the 40th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Portugal appeared intent on forsaking any attack, dropping its  
entire lineup back to protect the goal. After several near-misses 
in the first 20 minutes of the match, the U.S. finally broke 
through with Lilly's first goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Shannon MacMillan also scored for the U.S. team.

<HEADLINE> House Managers Have Court Background </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One House manager prosecuted President  
Clinton's brother, another is a former military judge, and the 
third has been both a judge and a prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, three impeachment prosecutors face perhaps the  
biggest challenges of their legal careers: prying enough new 
information from Monica Lewinsky and two other witnesses to 
jump-start the case against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is very serious lawyering here,'' said Mark Hager, an  
American University law professor. ``Very nitty-gritty 
fact-crunching is what they're down to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., will question Ms. Lewinsky under oath  
Monday in the first of three videotaped sessions ordered by 
senators to help them decide whether witnesses will be called to 
testify on the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
	During the following two days, Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., will  
quiz presidential confidant Vernon Jordan, and Rep. James Rogan, 
R-Calif., will question White House aide Sidney Blumenthal. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant may have been chosen to question Ms. Lewinsky because his  
low-key speaking manner could appear nonthreatening to a young 
adult with no legal training. First elected to Congress in 1994, he 
earlier served in the Army's Judge Advocate General Corps and 
taught law at the U.S. Military Academy. 
</P>
<P>
	To question Jordan -- a wealthy, high-powered lawyer and Clinton  
loyalist -- prosecutors chose Hutchinson, a former U.S. attorney in 
Arkansas who prosecuted Clinton's brother, Roger, on drug charges 
in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson called his opening presentation to the Senate ``a  
humbling experience for a small-town lawyer,'' but his animated, 
largely extemporaneous speech showed his courtroom experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Fields, a Fort Smith, Ark., attorney who as a state  
prosecutor worked with Hutchinson on several matters, remembers him 
as a knowledgeable and energetic prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not all attorneys are trial attorneys, but he is one of the  
attorneys that is able to think on his feet,'' Fields said. When 
questioning a witness, he said, Hutchinson thinks on both sides of 
an issue and anticipates possible defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogan, who will question Blumenthal, has been on both sides of  
the bench. He has been a deputy Los Angeles County district 
attorney and a judge in California's Glendale Judicial District. 
</P>
<P>
	All three prosecutors are looking for new testimony to convince  
senators that Clinton should be ousted from office for attempting 
to cover up his affair with Ms. Lewinsky, a former White House 
intern. But each witness may require a very different approach. 
</P>
<P>
	Questioning Ms. Lewinsky is ``going to be very delicate and it's  
not clear whose witness she is,'' said Hager of American 
University. ``Nobody wants to be beating up on her in a way that 
reaches the public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Ms. Lewinsky and Jordan are expected to be asked about his  
effort to find her a job at a time when she planned to file a sworn 
statement -- in Paula Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit -- denying an 
affair with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky has testified that Jordan told her in December 1997  
to get rid of notes she had written to the president and that 
another time he said her problem was ``you're in love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan told a federal grand jury last March that although he and  
Ms. Lewinsky once discussed the job search and her affidavit in the 
same phone conversation, ``As far as I was concerned, they were two 
very separate matters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson may have the hardest job in questioning Jordan, said  
Mark Tushnet, a Georgetown University law professor. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have to get him to budge from a position he's taken, and  
he's an experienced lawyer who's very smooth,'' Tushnet said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hager added, ``The gloves will come off if they have to with  
him. ... That will be hardball stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In questioning Blumenthal, Rogan will try to bolster the  
obstruction of justice allegation against Clinton. Last September, 
Blumenthal told a federal grand jury that on Jan. 21, 1998, the day 
the Lewinsky scandal broke, Clinton told him he had rebuffed sexual 
demands from Ms. Lewinsky and that she told Clinton she was known 
as a ``stalker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former federal prosecutor Barbara Nicastro said Rogan could ask  
Blumenthal if his conversation with Clinton led him unwittingly to 
give false information to the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Blumenthal can be made to concede, `He did lie to me, ...  
and I testified to what he told me,''' it could score points for 
the obstruction case, Nicastro said.

<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Statement from Lawrence Taylor after his election  
to the Pro Football Hall of Fame: 
</P>
<P>
	``I am humbled by being elected to the Pro Football Hall of  
Fame. As I have said, I feel like it is the ultimate award for 
playing the game that I love so much and gave so much. I appreciate 
the debate and the consideration that was given to my nomination. 
Ultimately, this honor has to do with how I played the game. 
Obviously, the majority of the committee felt the same way. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't always come across, but I do appreciate the well  
wishes and concerns of my family, my friends and my former 
teammates. It means a great deal to me. It truly does. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to thank my coaches, especially Bill Parcells, my  
teammates and the Giants ownership, especially Mr. (Wellington) 
Mara. I would not be receiving this honor if it weren't for them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Finally, I thank the Giants fans. When the Giants organization  
retired my jersey, I said this then and I'll say it now: There 
always has been and will be a Lawrence Taylor, but without the 
fans, there would never have been an LT.''

</P>
<P>
	TURON, Kan. (AP) -- Jane Bauman, who wrote the weekly ``Farm and  
Fancy'' column for The Hutchinson News for the past 40 years, died 
Wednesday. She was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bauman began her writing career in the 1950s with the Pratt  
Tribune and the Hutchinson Record. She started her weekly column 
for The Hutchinson News in 1959, typing all of her columns on a 
typewriter and mailing them to the newspaper from her home. Her 
last column appeared Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauman, a longtime member of the Kansas and National Press  
Women's Associations, won numerous awards and recognition for her

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Vernon Berg 3d, an artist who was one of the  
first officers to stand up to the military after he was discharged 
for being homosexual, died Wednesday of complications from AIDS. He 
was 47. 
</P>
<P>
	Berg was given an ``other than honorable'' discharge from the  
Navy as an ensign in 1976 after an investigation revealed he was in 
a gay relationship. He sued, and the armed forces later adopted a 
policy of generally granting honorable discharges to homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1978, a federal appeals court ruled Berg and another officer  
were unfairly discharged, but didn't reinstate them. His discharge 
was upgraded to honorable as a result of the legal action. 
</P>
<P>
	Berg, a graduate of the Naval Academy at Annapolis, went on to  
become a prolific artist who documented life with AIDS in 
sculptures, paintings, photographs and cartoonlike drawings.

<P>
	NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- Leonard C. Lewin, whose Vietnam-era  
satire on the dangers of peace resurfaced three decades later to 
fuel the conspiracy theories of paramilitary groups, died Thursday. 
He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
	His 1967 satire, ``Report From Iron Mountain,'' was the supposed  
report of a top-secret study group that concluded world peace would 
be catastrophic to society. 
</P>
<P>
	Debate immediately raged about whether it was real, and the  
parody hit The New York Times' best-seller list in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1972, Lewin confessed that he had concocted the report.  
</P>
<P>
	``Report from Iron Mountain'' went out of print in 1980, but a  
few years ago Lewin received a request from a white supremacist 
group in Arkansas wanting to buy old copies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Liberty Lobby, a far-right group, was offering copies of the  
book as a genuine government report.

</P>
<P>
	SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- Mason Walsh, former publisher of The  
Arizona Republic and The Phoenix Gazette, died Saturday due to 
complications from pneumonia. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh was publisher of the two newspapers from 1978 until his  
retirement in 1980. He began work in 1966 at the papers' corporate 
parent, Phoenix Newspapers Inc., as general manager and became 
assistant publisher in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh was a reporter, city editor and news editor for the Dallas  
Dispatch-Journal from 1935-42 and served as editor of the Austin 
Times-Herald in 1942. 
</P>
<P>
	During the Depression, Walsh also played violin, cello and viola  
in movie and vaudeville theaters, on radio, with dance bands and 
with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a stint in the public relations and personnel  
departments with North American Aviation in Dallas, Walsh resumed 
his journalism career in 1945 as city editor of the Dallas 
Times-Herald. He served as managing editor there from 1952-60. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1960-66, Wash was managing editor of The Phoenix Gazette,  
an afternoon newspaper that shut down in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh was national president of the Associated Press Managing  
Editors Association in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, Anne; sons Tim and Kevin, chief of  
bureau of the AP in Miami; a daughter, Peggy Walsh, former chief of 
bureau of the AP in San Francisco; and two grandchildren.

``had a very analytical mind and would write editorials that would 
make you stop and think,'' said Ron Bunch, executive director of 
the Abbeville County Development Board. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Brooks, Ga., West attended The Citadel for two years  
before getting an appointment to the Naval Academy at Annapolis. He

</P>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Mario Zacchini, the ``human cannonball'' who  
entertained circus-goers for decades, died Thursday of kidney 
failure. He was 87. 
</P>
<P>
	Zacchini's death marked the end of an era. He was the oldest  
member of a Tampa circus family, the last of seven brothers -- five 
of whom were known as human cannonballs. 
</P>
<P>
	In their heyday in the 1920s, '30s and '40s, the Zacchini  
brothers wowed crowds as they catapulted out of cannons at speeds 
up to 90 mph, flying over Ferris wheels. 
</P>
<P>
	They performed at world fairs, circuses and carnivals in the  
United States and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight years ago, the family was inducted into Ringling Brothers  
and Barnum &AMP; Bailey's Circus Ring of Fame in Sarasota. 
</P>
<P>
	Their father, Ildebrando, who started as a circus clown,  
suggested the human cannonball act in the 1920s in Italy. The 
brothers built a cannon and work began. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1929, while in Denmark traveling with their father's circus,  
the Zacchini Brothers Circus, John Ringling hired one brother to 
work in Florida. Within a few years, the others joined him. In 
1939, the family moved to Tampa.

<HEADLINE> N.Y. Toxic Fire Sites To Be Tested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FENTON, N.Y. (AP) -- The state will test soil in an area where  
firefighters burned toxic liquids over a 20-year period to 
determine if the fires contributed to a rash of cancer cases in 
this tiny hamlet. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers began probing causes for the cancer cluster after  
six children living within blocks of each other in the Hillcrest 
section of town were diagnosed with the disease over the last two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the children have died.  
</P>
<P>
	Officials are focusing their study on sites near Chenango Valley  
High School where firefighters burned toxic liquids, including 
motor oil and industrial printing ink, during training exercises 
from the 1960s to the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to plead ignorance,'' Hillcrest Fire Chief Norman  
Montgomery said in Friday's editions of the Binghamton Press and 
Sun Bulletin. ``We didn't know how bad it was back then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Used motor oil typically contains lead, chromium and other  
hazardous chemicals, said Tom Pierce, a toxicologist with the 
University of Kansas Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Long-term exposure to chromium and lead can damage the vital  
organs and nervous system, and is also suspected of causing cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the new cancer cases were diagnosed in 1997 and 1998,  
nearly 15 years after the last fire. Officials from the Department 
of Environmental Conservation will test the soil at the fire sites 
to see if any burned soot or residue from the motor oil or ink 
remains. 
</P>
<P>
	If so, the agency will then determine if the pollutants could  
have seeped into groundwater or been blown through the air. 
</P>
<P>
	The families of cancer victims support the investigation.  
</P>
<P>
	``I want to know why my daughter died,'' said Patricia Casey,  
who lost her 14-year-old daughter to brain cancer in 1978. ``I 
can't understand why it happened, and it's happened too much.''

<HEADLINE> Suspected Terrorist Nabbed in D.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. Park Police officers detained a man near  
the White House Saturday after police said the Secret Service 
described him as a possible terrorist. Secret Service officials 
swiftly announced there was no terrorist connection. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a person we have come into contact with before,''  
Secret Service spokesman Jim Mackin said. He described the man's 
detention and questioning as routine and voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is not a terrorist. There is nothing linking him to any  
terrorist organization. He had no weapons, made no threats,'' 
Mackin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Park Police detained the man at midafternoon near the Ellipse, a  
grassy area outside the White House's south gate, and took him to 
the Secret Service's Washington field office for questioning, said 
Lt. Cheryl Braun. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers were alerted at midday to look for a man spotted  
``acting suspiciously'' in the White House tour line. Park Police 
Sgt. Michael Keenan said the Secret Service fingered the man as a 
possible terrorist and ordered him detained. 
</P>
<P>
	Another official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the  
buzz about a suspected terrorist link began when the man, familiar 
to officers around the White House as a homeless man, dropped a 
piece of paper bearing the name of a known terrorist organization. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and the first lady left the White House at  
midday and helicoptered to the presidential retreat at Camp David 
for a long-planned weekend respite.

country, followed a left cross with a hard shot to the body that 
dropped the Bahamas-born Barr. 
</P>
<P>
	Barr, was turned around by the blows, then walked away and sunk  
to his knees in a neutral corner. Schenk improved to 22-0 with 12 
knockouts while Barr fell to 18-2. 
</P>
<P>
	The superior punching power of Schenk proved decisive in a close  
fight. He snapped the American's head back with the left cross at 
the end of both the first and third rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first step in showing that I can mix it up with  
the best in the world,'' said Schenk, 28. ``I landed some clean 
blows and they had their effect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The title had been vacant since American Otis Grant gave it up  
last year in order to challenge light heavyweight champion Roy 
Jones Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Schenk had been regarded in Germany as a talented but lazy  
fighter. As an amateur, he twice defeated Cuba's highly regarded 
Olympic champion Ariel Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
	The right-handed Barr confused Schenk early in the fight by  
constantly switching to a southpaw style, but he couldn't hurt the 
German with his punches. 
</P>
<P>
	Schenk became the fifth world champion fighting in Germany, all  
for Hamburg's Universum Box Promotion. He was the first German to 
fight for a middleweight title in 59 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Schenk weighed 158 pounds while Barr was 157.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Mikulski Out of Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Sen. Barbara Mikulski was released from the  
hospital Saturday after surgery to remove her gall bladder. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Mikulski, 62, was hospitalized Thursday and underwent  
surgery Friday at Mercy Medical Center. She expected to get her 
doctors' go-ahead to return to the Senate floor on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maryland Democrat went to Mercy's emergency room Tuesday  
with complaints of severe, lingering flu-like symptoms. Her office 
said doctors discovered that they were caused by an inflamed gall 
bladder. 
</P>
<P>
	She returned to Washington for Wednesday's votes on an  
unsuccessful Democratic measure to end President Clinton's 
impeachment trial. After consulting with leadership, she decided to 
have the surgery and missed three votes Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked Saturday how she thought the trial was proceeding,  
Ms. Mikulski said, ``I've just gotten rid of gall stones, which was 
a lot less complicated than dealing with impeachment.''

<HEADLINE>  Managers Plan Lewinsky Questioning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Impeachment prosecutors expect Monica Lewinsky  
to support an obstruction of justice charge against President 
Clinton with ``almost total recall'' of her conversations with him 
and her interpretation of what he said, House officials familiar 
with the strategy contend. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecution team believes that Ms. Lewinsky ``has a lot of  
information if you ask the right questions,'' said one House 
official, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., a soft-spoken former federal prosecutor  
and small-town lawyer, was assigned to question Ms. Lewinsky. He 
must skillfully use the former intern's interpretation of events to 
overcome Ms. Lewinsky's statement that ``no one ever asked me to 
lie, and I was never promised a job for my silence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, The New York Times reported in Sunday's editions that  
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr has concluded he has the 
constitutional authority to seek a grand jury indictment of Clinton 
before the president leaves office. 
</P>
<P>
	Attributing its account to several unidentified associates of  
Starr, the newspaper said that despite concluding he has legal 
authority to seek a criminal indictment, Starr has not decided 
whether to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is persuaded by precedent and logic that a sitting  
president can be indicted,'' one associate who was said to speak 
frequently with Starr told the Times. ``But he has given no hint 
about whether he would do it, either now or sometime down the 
road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House reacted quickly.  
</P>
<P>
	``Besides reinforcing his own stereotype as an out-of-control  
prosecutor, Ken Starr is tampering with the Senate trial,'' said 
White House special counsel Jim Kennedy. ``Somebody ought to tell 
him he's not the 101st senator.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Times reported that Starr agreed with the conclusion of two  
constitutional law scholars hired as consultants that the 
Constitution does not bar indictment of a sitting president. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate response to a request for comment from  
Starr spokesman Charles Bakaly, but he told the Times: ``We will 
not discuss the plans of this office or the plans of the grand jury 
in any way, shape or form.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant is expected to ask Ms. Lewinsky about her false affidavit  
in the Paula Jones case, an attempt to get her a job after she 
appeared on the Paula Jones case witness list and Oval Office 
secretary Betty Currie's retrieval of presidential gifts from the 
former intern. 
</P>
<P>
	The House team has promised to stay away from intimate details  
of her sexual relationship with the president, and any questions 
even at the edge of the subject would be approached gingerly. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant will use impressions received a week ago when he and two  
other managers informally interviewed Ms. Lewinsky, House sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials said the managers left Washington's Mayflower  
Hotel after the interview with the impression that Ms. Lewinsky 
felt ``very comfortable'' with Bryant, who demonstrated his concern 
by asking her about the difficulties she has encountered since her 
affair with Clinton became public. 
</P>
<P>
	The managers also viewed Ms. Lewinsky as an extremely  
intelligent, even-tempered witness with -- as one House source 
described it -- ``almost total recall on Clinton. She was breaking 
her neck to tell the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky's closed deposition will be the first of three  
approved by senators in Clinton's impeachment trial, which is in 
recess until Thursday. Questioning of presidential friend Vernon 
Jordan is scheduled for Tuesday and of White House aide Sidney 
Blumenthal on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lewinsky testimony is also crucial to Clinton's lawyers, who  
will have their first chance to cross-examine her. 
</P>
<P>
	All the testimony will be videotaped and reviewed by senators,  
who are expected to decide next week whether to make the 
depositions public and whether to seek live testimony by Ms. 
Lewinsky or the other witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan is virtually certain to question Ms. Lewinsky about two  
crucial dates in late 1997, after her Dec. 5 appearance on the 
witness list in Mrs. Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit against the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	On Dec. 17, Clinton called Ms. Lewinsky after 2 a.m. and told  
her about the list. Ms. Lewinsky testified earlier, ``I believe 
that I probably asked him, you know, what should I do,'' and ``He 
suggested ..., `Well, maybe you can sign an affidavit.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors contend that both Ms. Lewinsky and the president  
knew she couldn't file a truthful affidavit because that would 
reveal the affair they both had worked diligently to conceal. So 
Clinton reminded her of a cover story they had used before to 
explain their relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, you can always say you were coming to see Betty or  
that you were bringing me letters,'' Clinton was quoted by Ms. 
Lewinsky as saying. She testified, ``I knew exactly what he 
meant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Ms. Lewinsky said Clinton never explicitly told her to  
lie, Bryant could point to Ms. Lewinsky's testimony that offered 
another interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I also said that ... it wasn't as if the president  
called me and said, 'You know, Monica, you're on the witness list. 
This is going to be really hard for us. We're going to have to tell 
the truth and be humiliated.''' 
</P>
<P>
	A second key date is Dec. 28, when Ms. Lewinsky discussed with  
Clinton what to do with subpoenaed presidential gifts. Later that 
day, Oval Office secretary Betty Currie came to pick them up from 
Ms. Lewinsky's apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	``At some point I said to him, 'Well, ... maybe I should put the  
gifts away outside my house somewhere or give them to someone, 
maybe Betty.' And he sort of said -- I think he responded 'I don't 
know' or 'Let me think about that,''' Ms. Lewinsky testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors expect Ms. Lewinsky would testify the same way  
Monday, although White House lawyers have pointed out that on other 
occasions, Ms. Lewinsky couldn't remember any Clinton reaction when 
she mentioned the gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	While House managers concluded that Clinton must have sent Mrs.  
Currie for the gifts, there is no testimony from anyone that the 
president orchestrated the retrieval. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have tried to bolster their case by showing that  
Mrs. Currie called Ms. Lewinsky that day, even though Mrs. Currie 
testified that it was Ms. Lewinsky who called her. 
</P>
<P>
	The House has introduced evidence of a cellular phone call from  
Mrs. Currie to Ms. Lewinsky, which the White House attacked as 
being to short in duration to arrange the pickup and coming too 
late in the sequence of events. 
</P>
<P>
	During the informal interview, Ms. Lewinsky told the House team  
of three previous calls from Mrs. Currie earlier in the day to 
arrange the pickup -- calls that were not logged on White House 
records.

<HEADLINE> Acting in Cards for Gaby Hoffman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Acting was always in the cards for Gaby Hoffman,  
daughter of Andy Warhol film icon Viva -- as a matter of necessity 
though, not destiny. 
</P>
<P>
	Life wasn't all glamour for Viva after her glitzy run with  
Warhol in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	``I started acting when I was 5 because we were on welfare,''  
Hoffman says in the March issue of Spin magazine. ``It's not like I 
ever really decided to act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 17-year-old grew up in the famed Chelsea Hotel, once known  
for its drug dealers and prostitutes, making commercials and 
appearing in films that included ``Uncle Buck,'' ``Now and Then,'' 
``Everyone Says I Love You,'' and ``Field of Dreams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year she'll be seen in at least five movies, including  
``Strike'' with Lynn Redgrave, the sex farce ``Coming Soon'' and 
``200 Cigarettes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Recently returned to New York after a move to Los Angeles,  
Hoffman says cash flow troubles still plague the family. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mom's still out there becasue we don't have the money to  
move her back,'' Hoffman said.

<HEADLINE> Oneida Indian Land Claim Protested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VERONA, N.Y. (AP) -- Hundreds of demonstrators with car horns  
blaring circled the Oneida Indian casino on Saturday, protesting 
the tribe's lawsuit to win back 250,000 acres of ancestral lands. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit, first brought against two upstate counties in 1974,  
was amended in December to include some 20,000 property owners in 
the area east of Syracuse, a move that angered and frightened 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope to keep my land,'' said Adelbert Williams, whose  
300-acre farm is in the contested area. ``My family has lived here 
for over 100 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rally of more than 550 vehicles, from station wagons to a  
tractor-trailer rig, began at Verona Town Hall, traveled about 15 
miles east to Rome, then came back to the Oneidas' Turning Stone 
Casino complex. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Emery, spokesman for the Oneida Indian Nation, said the  
procession was misplaced. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rally shows the people's frustration and concern, but it's  
in the wrong place,'' Emery said. ``The problem is the state of New 
York, not the Oneida Nation. There's been 150 years of inaction by 
the state. ... The Oneida Nation never wanted to take anybody's 
land and they still don't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Oneida Indians of New York, Wisconsin and Canada sued Oneida  
and Madison counties in 1974 and again in 1985 to get back more the 
lands they claim were wrongfully ceded to New York state in the 
late 18th and early 19th centuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1985 that the Oneidas were  
entitled to compensation. However, the Oneidas and state officials 
have been unable to reach a settlement and negotiations have 
languished, so the tribes broadened the suit to include private 
property owners. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally didn't slow business inside the casino, which even  
drew at least one of the protesters inside. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see having a view one way as meaning you can't have a  
little fun in here,'' Dave Barnick, a protester from Cayuga County, 
said as he left the motorcade and walked inside to gamble.

	NATO Approves Force in Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- NATO leaders have authorized  
Secretary-General Javier Solana to launch military action in 
Yugoslavia if the warring parties don't negotiate an agreement for 
autonomy in Kosovo. The move came after Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic balked at threats of an attack and challenged a U.S. and 
European ultimatum to hold Kosovo peace talks outside his country. 
The United States and five European powers want internationally

	Lewinsky Seen Supporting Prosecutors  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Impeachment prosecutors expect Monica Lewinsky  
to support an obstruction of justice charge against President 
Clinton with ``almost total recall'' of her conversations with him 
and her interpretation of what he said, House officials familiar 
with the strategy contend. It is expected that Ms. Lewinsky will be 
questioned about her false affidavit in the Paula Jones case. The 
House team has promised to stay away from intimate details of her 
sexual relationship with the president.

	ROCHESTER, Minn. (AP) -- King Hussein of Jordan will undergo a  
second bone marrow transplant after ending chemotherapy at the Mayo 
Clinic for his recurring cancer, his personal physician said. 
Hussein, 63, is in stable condition, doctors said. Hussein returned 
to Minnesota abruptly from Jordan on Tuesday for treatment of what 
the clinic termed a relapse of his non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. He 
recently named his son Abdullah his heir.

	Famine May Persist in North Korea  
</P>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- A U.N. aid coordinator today warned that famine  
will persist in North Korea if more is not done to revive the 
country's decrepit rural economy. Despite massive supplies of food 
aid, shortages and famine-related illnesses have killed up to 2 
million of North Korea's 23 million people during the past three 
years, according to U.S. congressional estimates. Two-thirds of all 
children under seven are malnourished, and lack of food has stunted 
the growth of millions more. Decades of economic mismanagement 
combined with several years of bad weather brought the farming 
system in the communist nation to a state of collapse.

	Minimum Tax May Be Changed  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is proposing a  
two-year reprieve for millions of middle-class people who might 
otherwise face unexpectedly higher tax bills simply because they 
took advantage of new education or child tax credits. The proposal 
would ensure that people of modest incomes who use such credits are 
not unwittingly subject to the alternative minimum tax, a complex 
tax created to prevent the wealthy from sheltering too much income. 
A senior administration official said the measure excluding such 
credits from the minimum tax will be included in the fiscal 2000 
budget President Clinton will unveil Monday.

	U.N. OKs Panels To Assess Iraq

<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The U.N. Security Council approved the  
first modest step to break the diplomatic logjam over Iraq on 
today, agreeing to establish panels to assess Iraqi disarmament and 
adherence to other U.N. resolutions. The agreement was the first 
formal council action on Iraq since last month's U.S. and British 
airstrikes shattered the council's uneasy unity. The panels are to 
study Iraqi adherence on disarmament, humanitarian issues, looted 
Kuwaiti property and the status of Kuwaitis missing since Iraq's 
1990 occupation of the country.

	MIAMI (AP) -- Lawrence Taylor, one of the greatest linebackers in  
the history of the NFL, was elected to the Pro Football Hall of 
Fame today, ending speculation that his off-field troubles would 
keep him from being enshrined. Since his retirement in 1993, Taylor 
has been arrested twice on drug charges, was found guilty of filing 
false income tax returns and was questioned by a grand jury 
investigating organized crime.

<HEADLINE> Buddy Holly...40 Years Later </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEAR LAKE, Iowa (AP) -- It has become known as ``the day the  
music died.'' But for thousands of rock 'n' roll fans, the music 
lives and is drawing them to a northern Iowa dance hall for the 
40th anniversary of the deaths of Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and 
J.P. ``The Big Bopper'' Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not celebrating that they crashed,'' said Scott  
Anderson, who owns the Surf Ballroom in Clear Lake. ``We're 
celebrating their music. Their music lives on and I think that's 
what people come back for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three rising stars were killed Feb. 3, 1959, just after  
performing at the Surf. They took off from the nearby Mason City 
airport in the middle of a snowstorm, bound for another concert in 
Moorhead, Minn. Their four-seater plane crashed in a cornfield 
about five miles north of Clear Lake, killing them and their pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	The Surf, as it has for the past two decades, will mark that  
fateful night with a concert next Saturday featuring Bobby Vee, 
Holly's band the Crickets, and other famous names from the time. As 
usual, the ``Winter Dance Party'' is a sellout, with fans from 
around the world snatching up all 2,200 tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul King of Northamptonshire, England, is making it his sixth  
consecutive Holly tribute. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do tend to revolve around Buddy Holly, it's true,'' said  
King, 53, who runs a construction business. ``But we get to know 
the local people and the families and the artists. It's a 
pilgrimage, really. We're overawed by the whole thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holly, a rockabilly singer from Lubbock, Texas, whose real name  
was Charles Hardin Holley, was just 22 when he died. But he had 
recorded dozens of songs, including the hits ``That'll Be the 
Day,'' ``Peggy Sue,'' and ``Rave On.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Artists from Bob Dylan to Paul McCartney have said their music  
was influenced by his style. In his 1972 hit ``American Pie,'' Don 
McLean described Holly's death as ``the day the music died.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are still Buddy Holly fan clubs, magazines and books, Web  
sites full of Holly trivia and movies and musicals based on his 
life. A statue of him stands in Lubbock and the city is building a 
permanent exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the real details of the story bear an ``urban-myth''  
quality, seemingly too fantastic to be true: 
</P>
<P>
	--A young bass guitarist who performed with Holly in Clear Lake  
gave up his seat on the plane to Richardson, who had the flu, so 
the ``Bopper'' wouldn't have to ride in the band's old bus all the 
way to the next concert. Wracked by guilt over joking with Holly 
about the plane crashing, he avoided the Surf for decades before 
finally returning for a concert in 1995. ``I lost some great 
friends that night,'' Waylon Jennings told the crowd at his Surf 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	--A legendary crooner might not have gotten his start without  
that tragic night. At just 15, Bobby Vee filled in at the Moorhead 
concert after the plane crash. It was his first public performance 
and a record agent in the crowd liked the band's sound. Vee has 
since produced more than 25 albums with hits including ``Take Good 
Care of My Baby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The restored Surf Ballroom remains true to its early roots, with  
'50s-style pineapple wallpaper and bright, feather-patterned carpet 
in the entryway. 
</P>
<P>
	Karen Lien of Mason City was 18 when she went to the Surf for  
Holly's concert. The next morning, she heard on the news that the 
singers had been killed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think my mouth just dropped open,'' she said. ``We couldn't  
believe it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lien is now a 58-year-old grandmother and her boyfriend from the  
concert is her husband. She avidly collects Buddy Holly memorabilia 
and wishes she had saved her ticket stub from that night. 
</P>
<P>
	Two memorials to Holly and the other musicians have been placed  
in the Clear Lake area. One, a large, gray stone, is at the Surf. 
The other, a guitar and three records fashioned out of stainless 
steel, stands at the crash site. 
</P>
<P>
	And this year, for the 40th anniversary, a group that includes a  
nephew of Valens and Niki Sullivan of the Crickets is replicating 
that final tour. The group wraps up with a concert Tuesday at the 
Surf. 
</P>
<P>
	Even after 50 years, people still recognize Holly's  
contributions to music, Vee said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We heard rock 'n' roll evolve through Buddy Holly,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Auditors Find FEC Fair, Nonpartisan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A congressionally mandated independent audit  
pushed by Republican critics, finds the Federal Election Commission 
is ``impartial, ethical and independent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $750,000 audit by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, released  
Friday, said the FEC operated ``without partisan bias.'' Congress 
ordered the study in 1997 following complaints from some 
congressional Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The agency operates in a fair, impartial manner,'' the audit  
said, giving an ``unqualified yes'' to the question, ``Are FEC 
programs conducted in an impartial, ethical and independent 
manner?'' 
</P>
<P>
	FEC Chairman Scott Thomas and Vice Chairman Darryl Wold said  
they were ``gratified'' at the findings. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong defender of the FEC, Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., said  
criticism of the agency should stop. ``I hope this audit finally 
ends the mean-spirited, partisan vendetta that some Republicans 
have waged against the FEC,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Republicans in the House and Senate unsuccessfully  
tried to push through a provision to limit the staff director and 
general counsel to four-year terms. Under the proposal, they could 
not be reappointed unless four of the six commissioners -- now 
evenly divided among Democrats and Republicans -- agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats argued that the effort was designed to get rid of FEC  
general counsel Lawrence Noble, who had audited both GOPAC, the 
political action committee formerly headed by then-House Speaker 
Newt Gingrich, and the Christian Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	In their report, the auditors recommended requiring candidates  
to file their disclosure reports electronically so FEC staff could 
spend less time entering data into its computers and more time 
enforcing election laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``The current well-regarded FEC disclosure function faces  
deterioration under the rapidly increasing volume of campaign 
finance transactions expected in future election cycles,'' the 
report said. ``The threat of the increasing volume and volatility 
of workload for the FEC is real and near.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House candidates can decide to file electronically rather than  
submit paper records, but Thomas and Wold said Congress would have 
to pass legislation to require that all filings be done 
electronically. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will work closely with Congress to effect those changes  
that will improve the FEC's operations,'' they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The audit didn't address another common criticism of the FEC --  
that the commission's bipartisan makeup is an invitation to 
gridlock.

<HEADLINE> Witness May Have Gotten $2 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The key undercover witness in the nation's  
biggest drug money laundering case was paid more than $2 million to 
help prosecutors, according to testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	The informant, identified in court papers only as CW-1, was  
involved in Operation Casablanca. About 40 Mexican and Venezuelan 
businessmen, bankers and alleged drug cartel members were arrested 
in May following the two-year U.S. Customs undercover operation 
that spanned several countries. 
</P>
<P>
	During a pretrial hearing Friday before U.S. District Judge  
Lourdes Baird, defense attorneys argued that the payments amounted 
to government misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	The payments provided ``perverse incentive for the informant to  
manufacture crime,'' Michael Pancer, representing defendant Katy 
Kissel Belfer, argued in a brief filed with the court. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors said the payments were reasonable given the  
size of the investigation and the risks taken by the informant. 
</P>
<P>
	``He worked full time -- he had to be available 24 hours a day --  
for the entire length of the investigation,'' Joseph A. Brandolino 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the rest of his life, he has to look over his shoulder,''  
Julie Shemitz said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the 40 arrests, 70 people are fugitives in the  
case, which alleges tens of millions of dollars in illegal drug 
profits for the Cali drug cartel of Colombia and Mexico's Juarez 
cartel were shipped through phony transactions to Mexican-owned 
banks to conceal their origin. 
</P>
<P>
	The indicted banks, including prominent Mexican financial  
institutions Bancomer, Banca Serfin and Confia, have denied any 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	The first of four trials in the case is scheduled to begin March  
29. Four Mexican nationals pleaded guilty to charges last month. 
</P>
<P>
	According to court documents, CW-1, believed to be a naturalized  
U.S. citizen born in Columbia, helped undercover Customs agents 
pose as money launderers.

<HEADLINE> JAMA Member Resigns in Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- An editorial board member of The Journal of the  
American Medical Association has resigned to protest the recent 
firing of the magazine's editor. 
</P>
<P>
	The editor, Dr. George Lundberg, was fired Jan. 15 after he  
published a study on how American views differ on the question of 
what constitutes sex. AMA executive Vice President E. Ratcliffe 
Anderson Jr. said the timing, coinciding with President Clinton's 
impeachment trial, raised questions about Lundberg's judgment. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Donald A. B. Lindberg, director of the National Library of  
Medicine, stepped down from the magazine's editorial board Thursday 
because of the firing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It creates the wrong impression,'' Lindberg said. ``It  
suggests there was some serious fault attributed to Dr. Lundberg or 
to the board.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lindberg, who has been a JAMA board member for five years, said  
Lundberg had elevated the journal to worldwide prominence in his 17 
years as editor and that his firing reflected poorly on the members 
of the editorial board. 
</P>
<P>
	The article that led to Lundberg's firing was based on 1991  
survey data by the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender and 
Reproduction that found that most of the 599 college students 
surveyed did not consider oral-genital contact as having ``had 
sex.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other JAMA editors, JAMA's editorial board members and editors  
of the AMA Archives journals issued an editorial Tuesday 
criticizing Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	And in an editorial posted on the Internet last weekend, the  
editor of the prestigious British medical journal The Lancet said 
Anderson should resign.
