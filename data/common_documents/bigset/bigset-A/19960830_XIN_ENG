<HEADLINE> 300 New Laws Passed In China Since Reform Moves Of the Late 70s (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1982 the NPC adopted the new Constitution, with the spirit
of reform, for the first time giving the NPC Standing Committee
the power to make laws, and speeding up the pace of
legislation. Rules of Procedure of the NPC Standing Committee made
in 1987 standardized the lawmaking procedure and improved the
quality of legislation.
</P>
<P>
The Eighth NPC Standing Committee promised as soon as it took
office that it would provide a fundamental legal framework for a
socialist market economy in five years. In 1993 it drew up a
legislative plan for 152 laws, of which 89 have been passed.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the public have been asked to
participate in the legislative process. The lawmakers have also
been "bold" in studying the experience of other countries.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese laws have become more and more specialized for
enforcing the letter of the law," Qi Minyou, a professor at Wuhan
University who has been involved in drafting and revising laws for
four years, said here today at the meeting, where he was a
non-voting delegate.
</P>
<P>
"Political, economic, social, and various other affairs are
beginning to be covered by laws in the country," he commented, so
the days of no laws to follow do not exist any more.
</P>
<P>
The enforcement of the law as a result of this is another
story and is unsatisfactory. "More effective measures must be
taken to fight against failure to abide by the law, lax law
enforcement, and letting law-breakers go free," Qiao Shi noted.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the top legislative body has also looked into
just how laws are being applied in local areas. These inspection
tours have become a part of the NPC Standing Committee's routine
work now.
</P>
<P>
The CPC and the Chinese government have made an effort to
publicize among the public about the law for over 10 years, and
will continue to do so, in order to increase public
awareness.
</P>
<P>
To develop a socialist legal system, Qiao Shi said, "the NPC
and its Standing Committee must continue to put legislative work
at the top of the agenda and deal with it, which is a heavy task."
</P>
<P>
They should, on the one hand, make laws needed by the market
economy and on the other, make laws on legislation and
supervision, and a new criminal code, Qiao concluded.

<HEADLINE> Arrests in Tainted Alcohol Case in Yunnan Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Thirty suspects have been
arrested in Huize County, in southwest China's Yunnan Province for
having caused dozens of people to die from drinking tainted
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
Li Rongping and Peng Chuanyun, farmers from Huize's Zhehai

A total of 192 people were poisoned by the tainted alcohol
between late June and July, 35 of whom died as a result and six
were left severely handicapped.
</P>
<P>
Local government acted promptly after receiving separate
reports of similar deaths, and an investigation by the local
health department showed that the deaths were caused by tainted
alcohol.

<HEADLINE> Agricultural Bank: Disaster Loans Will Top Six Billion Yuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Agricultural Bank of China
is expecting to provide disaster loans of six billion yuan this
year -- nearly twice up last year's level.
</P>
<P>
The bank's disaster-relief loans have increased this year
after many regions were hit by natural calamities, especially
floods which caused huge losses to local people.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by bank President Shi Jiliang in an
exclusive interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
In the first seven months of this year, the bank provided
disaster-hit areas with three billion yuan in loans. In the whole
of last year the bank's disaster-relief loans only totaled more
than two billion yuan, according to Shi
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the bank would provide a total of six billion
yuan to disaster-affected areas in 1996.

HONG KONG, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Third-seeded Brett Martin of
Australia succumbed to his Australian fellow Dan Jenson 15-9,
17-14, 7-15, 9-15, 15-14 in the second round of the Hong Kong Open
squash tournament on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Veteran Martin, losing finalist to Jansher Khan last year, has
not played competitively since May and failed to get into his
rhythm in his battle with world number 23 Jenson.
</P>
<P>
The third seed blamed ring-rustiness for his defeat, saying he
had not had any match practice and it was difficult getting back
into it.
</P>
<P>
The quarter-finals pit Jenson against compatriot Anthony Hill,
who beat Pakistan's Mir Zaman Gul 15-12, 15-11, 15-13.
</P>
<P>
Top seed Jansher Khan of Pakistan, aiming to win the title for
the eighth time, lost the third game against German qualifier
Simon Frenz before striking back to win 15-12, 15-7, 12-15, 15-10.
</P>
<P>
In the last eight, Jansher will meet England's world number 12

<HEADLINE> Unlicensed Small Coal Mines Come Under Fire From NPC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 29 (Xinhua) --- Unlicensed small coal mines
were harshly criticized by a member of the Standing Committee of
the National People's Congress today, who cited their poor safety
record and wasteful production.
</P>
<P>
Yang Jike said that many small coal mines are unlicensed and
lack basic safety precautions, and therefore frequently cause
accidents.
</P>
<P>
He said that more than 2,000 small coal mines owned by villages
and townships have licenses in the country, but did not say how
many do not.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that, because of their backward methods, the
mines also waste China's coal resources.
</P>
<P>
Yang said he hopes that the Law on Coal Industry and a law
governing village and township enterprises can be promulgated as
soon as possible. Those unlicensed coal mines should be shut down,
he added.

<HEADLINE> US New Home Sales Jump in July to 5-Month High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Sales of new homes in the
U.S. shot up by 7.9 percent in July to the highest level in five
months beyond expectation of many analysts.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Commerce Department reported today that sales of
single-family homes totaled 783,000 at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate, up from a revised 726,000 a month earlier when sales
initially were estimated at a 734,000 rate.
</P>
<P>
The rate in July was the highest since the sales peaked this
year at a rate of 784,000 in February. Sales in April and May were
revised downward.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts had expected a slight decline in July's new home
sales. The U.S. National Association of Realtors reported earlier
this week that sales of existing homes fell 0.5 percent in July
and analysts predicted new home sales would follow suit because
mortgage rates averaged 8.25 percent in the month, much higher
than 7.03 percent last January.
</P>
<P>
They said the surge of new home sales might be the latest
suggestion that the U.S. economy may not be slowing sufficiently
to avoid a Federal Reserve interest rate hike to prevent
inflation.
</P>
<P>
Sales during the first seven months of 1996 were 14.4 percent
above those during the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Sales of new homes in the country have remained above 700,000
for seven straight months, the first such string of advances since
November 1985 to June 1986.
</P>
<P>
Regionally, sales of new homes in July jumped by 12.5 percent
in the Midwest, 8.8 percent in the West and 7.5 percent in the
South. But they were down by 1.4 percent in the Northeast.

<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Sudan has officially requested
the British government to allow a Sudanese team to follow up the
investigations conducted by British police into the incident in
which a Sudanese airliner was hijacked.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese Minister of Justice Sayed Abdul Bassit said in a
statement, published in today's Akhbar el Yom, that Sudan hopes to
cooperate with Britain in the investigations in order to learn the
implications of the hijacking incident.
</P>
<P>
Sudan Airways Flight 150 to Amman was hijacked Monday while on
its way from Khartoum to Jordan with 186 passengers on board. It
landed in Larnaca, Cyprus, for refueling and proceeded to Britain
where the seven hijackers surrendered to the British authorities.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese minister praised the Britain's action, saying that
it was an appreciated humanitarian act.
</P>
<P>
British detectives questioned Wednesday the hijackers and
passengers from the aircraft, trying to piece together the events
that ended in the bloodless surrender at London's Stansted Airport.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 29 (Xinhua) --Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade
and Economic Co-operation Wu Yi said here today that China's and
Australia's economies are complementary and that there is great
potential for bilateral economic and trade co-operation.
</P>
<P>
In meeting with Tim Fischer, deputy prime minister and minister
of trade of Australia, Wu said that in recent years, economic and
trade relations between the two countries have developed rapidly
with trade volume reaching record highs for four consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, trade volume was 4.21 billion US dollars last
year and the figure for the first half of this year stood at 2.459
billion US dollars, an increase of 33.8 percent over the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Australia is one of China's most important foreign investment
sources and also one of the places where China directs most of its
overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this March, Australia had invested in more than
2,400 projects in China, involving an investment of 780 million US
dollars, while China had backed over 130 projects in Australia
with total investment there of 345 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that China is the largest buyer of Australian wool, and
is willing to increase co-operation in wool processing. She said
she hopes Australia will continue its investment and technology
transfers here.
</P>
<P>
She noted that China stresses its economic and trade
co-operation with Australia and is willing to create a more
favorable environment for co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said that economic and trade co-operation between
Australia and China have develop both in their strength and in
diversity, adding that the Australian government attaches great
importance to the development of economic and trade ties with
China.
</P>
<P>
Australia is not only willing to reinforce bilateral exchange
and co-operation in various fields but also to increase
coordination with China in multi-lateral economic and trade
relations and in organizations such as the APEC and WTO.

<HEADLINE> Jailed Hamas Leader's Health Worsens in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The condition of Sheikh Ahmed
Yassin, the ailing founder and spiritual mentor of Hamas, or the
Islamic Resistance Movement, apparently worsened, Israel
Television reported this evening.
</P>
<P>
Yassin, jailed for life in 1989 over the kidnaping and
killing of two Israeli soldiers, was transferred today from
his prison cell to a hospital in Ramla near Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Israeli security authorities fear that
should Yassin die while in Israeli captivity, Hamas will
retaliate with a new wave of violent attacks against Israeli
targets.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Hamas called for attacks against Israeli targets
during a general strike this morning, the first one of such kind
in two years, observed by Palestinians across the West Bank and
the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The four-hour strike, called for by Palestinian National
Authority President Yasser Arafat Wednesday to protest Israeli
government's policies on Jerusalem and the expansion of Jewish
settlements, started at 8:00 a.m. local time (0500 GMT) with all
shops and other commercial places were closed.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also called on all Moslems, including Arab Israelis, to
go and pray at the Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem Friday, despite the
Israeli closure on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader denounced Israel's activities in the
West Bank and Jerusalem, and invited Israeli Arabs, Jews and
Christians to join him in the war, which, he said, has been
started by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported today that in the wake of Arafat's
call for massive participation in the Friday prayer at the Aqsa
Mosque, Jerusalem police are expected to request reinforcement
to help keep order tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> Big US Chain to Stop Selling Cigarettes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Target chain, the third
largest discount retailer in the United States, will stop selling
cigarettes under growing pressures from the federal government to
bar the sale of tobacco products to children under the age of 18.
</P>
<P>
The decision by Target, which has 714 stores in 37 states, is
the first time such a large retail chain has dropped the selling
of tobacco, the New York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
"It costs lots of money to retrofit stores to put cigarettes
behind counters and to service tobacco customers," a Target
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Food and Drug Administration issued new
regulations to keep cigarettes out of the hands of teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
The company stopped selling tobacco in 50 stores two years ago
in a test that helped it conclude that it would not suffer
financially by quitting completely.
</P>
<P>
Target's move was hailed by anti-tobacco groups, and it also
was likely to enhance its image as a family-oriented enterprise.
The chain removed the Playboy magazine from its shelves in the
1970s and is among the most prominent retailers to have stopped
selling toy guns.

<HEADLINE> UK Government to Consider New Report on Mad Cow Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The British government has
promised to consider the latest report on the mad cow disease,
predicting the mad cow epidemic will be over in 2001, and agreed
to discuss farmers' demands for an end to a mass cattle slaughter.
</P>
<P>
Oxford scientists, writing in the scientific journal Nature,
said that the mad cow disease would decline naturally and would be
over in 2001 without the planned slaughter of 147,000 cattle.
</P>
<P>
Angela Browning, a senior minister of the British Agriculture
Ministry, said in a BBC television interview that the government
was already rethinking its slaughter plans following the
information announced earlier this month that the BSE or mad cow
disease can be passed on from cows to their calves.
</P>
<P>
"This new report will have to be taken into account. We will
obviously want to talk to the farmers' organization about this new
information," she said.
</P>
<P>
Sir David Naish, president of the National Farmers' Union
(NFU), has reportedly called on the government to hold an urgent
meeting to reconsider its strategy.
</P>
<P>
"The new evidence to me means some of that proposal should be
re-examined because we could get away with considerable less
animals being culled if in fact scientists throughout Europe
accept this evidence," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I have been saying consistently since the selective cull was
proposed that we didn't believe it was scientifically based. It
was a political expedient to satisfy some of the other member
states in Europe," he added.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the British Agriculture Ministry said this
afternoon that the government would be happy to discuss the new
report and the farmers' demands.
</P>
<P>
"There is a meeting with the NFU later next week and they will
address the issue there," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the European Commission, the executive arm of the
European Union (EU), said earlier today it would study the new
scientific report on the mad cow disease, but offered little
prospect that the findings would change an agreed slaughter plan.
</P>
<P>
EU Commission spokesman Gerard Kiely said today in Brussels,
"Obviously we are interested in this research. We will ask the EU
scientific and veterinary committee to examine it."
</P>
<P>
But he made it clear that it would be very difficult to sell to
the EU Commission a program which would involve the elimination of
the mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed a global ban on British beef products exports on
March 27 when the British government admitted that there were
possible links between the mad cow disease and its human equivalent
Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease.

<HEADLINE> Reno Sympathizes With Bomb Suspect's Mother </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno expressed her sympathy to the mother of Richard Jewell, who
remains a suspect in last month's bombing at the Atlanta Olympics,
but said investigation was continuing.
</P>
<P>
"I understand how she must feel," Reno said of Barbara Jewell,
who on Monday asked the White House to help clear her son as a
suspect in the Centennial Olympic Park bombing, which led to two
deaths and more than 100 injuries on July 27.
</P>
<P>
Richard Jewell, a park security guard who was the first to
notice the knapsack that held the bomb and tried to let people
away from the bomb, had been treated as a hero before he became a
suspect within days.
</P>
<P>
While showing her sympathy, Reno told her weekly news
conference, "I can't comment on the pending matter except to say
we need to do everything we can to pursue leads, to determine who
was responsible, and to make known who was responsible in the long
run."
</P>
<P>
A large amount of material was taken from searches of Jewell's
home, his former mountain cabin and his previous job site at a
college for testing at the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
laboratory in Washington. But the FBI has yet declared any
solution on the matter.
</P>
<P>
"I am asking the president for help as the head of the Justice
Department and the FBI," Mrs. Jewell told a news conference
arranged Monday by her son's lawyers. "You have the power to end
this nightmare. If the FBI does not intend to charge my son,
please tell us, please tell the world."
</P>
<P>
The White House press secretary, Mike McCurry, said Tuesday,
"We well understand the anguish of a mother in that position. But
because an investigation is under way, we must refrain from any
direct comment."

<HEADLINE> Intensive Israeli-Palestinian Contacts Under Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Intensive contacts between
the Israeli government and the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) were under way today as the two sides tried to calm the
current tension.
</P>
<P>
Senior negotiators to the Israeli-Palestinian Steering
Committee on peace talks met here this afternoon just after the
end of a four-hour Palestinian general strike.
</P>
<P>
This is the first such meeting since the creation of new
Israeli hardline Likud government in June.
</P>
<P>
The strike, the first in two years, was called a day earlier by
PNA President Yasser Arafat to protest against the Israeli
government's decision to expand settlements in the Palestinian
self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also called for massive participation by Moslems
and Christians in this Friday's prayers at the al-Aksa Mosque in
east Jerusalem, despite of the closure imposed by the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the introductive meeting, both
Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat and his Israeli
counterpart Dan Shomron described it as very "positive."
</P>
<P>
"We need to look forward. I conveyed my President's commitment
to the peace process and to the agreements that have been
signed. President Arafat's message was very clear: our full
commitment to the peace process," Erekat said.
</P>
<P>
"It is much more valuable than anything else," he stressed. "We
don't know about any other way to give a better life to the
Palestinians and Israelis and future, other than the continuation
of peace process."
</P>
<P>
Erekat added that the steering committee would formally
convene next week, hoping the permanent status talks would also
start very soon.
</P>
<P>
Talking about Arafat's statements on Wednesday, Erekat defended
them as "a clear-cut message of peace" aimed at urging Israel to
restart the peace negotiations that have been frozen so far.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized Israel's decision of expanding Jewish
settlements, saying that "the settlements and all the issues must
belong to the past." He demanded the Israeli government to
implement the agreements that were already in place in order to
save the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Shomron, describing the meeting as "good and frank," said that
it was not the atmosphere but the concrete progress in talks
should "play a role in lowering the kind of tension that we see
recently."
</P>
<P>
The former army Chief of Staff added that he hoped all "the
issues will be placed on the table" for discussion to advance the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani
revealed that a close friend of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
met secretly today with Arafat to discuss the current
situation. He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Netanyahu's senior diplomatic adviser
Dore Gold is to meet later today with Arafat's deputy Abu Mazen in
another effort to calm the situation.
</P>
<P>
Gold has just returned from Paris, where he discussed what was
described as "new ideas" to jump-start the stalled peace process
with his Egyptian counterpart Osama al-Baz and U.S. peace
coordinator Dennis Ross.

<HEADLINE> UK to Wipe Out BSE Threat in 5 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Britain will be free of BSE in
five years, which has so far killed 162,000 cattle, top scientists
predicted today.
</P>
<P>
A report from epidemiologists at Oxford University, published
today, showed only 7,000 more cattle will develop the disease from
the end of this year until 200l.
</P>
<P>
The report, based on computer prediction, is the first to put a
figure on the number of cows expected to catch the disease and
provide an estimate of when the epidemic will end.
</P>
<P>
It said measures to prevent the disease are proving effective
and the number of cases resulting from maternal transmission is so
small it does not matter.
</P>
<P>
British scientists are now challenging the European decision to
order the slaughter of uninfected cattle in a bid to restore
consumer confidence and satisfy public opinion.
</P>
<P>
The report said more than 42,000 cows will be killed
unnecessarily to catch just 1,500 diseased animals.
</P>
<P>
Professor Jeffrey Almond, a member of the government's BSE
advisory committee, said, "We are in the final throes of the
disease and I think the numbers of animals with BSE will really be
very small next year, dropping to just a few hundred the year
after that."
</P>
<P>
Professor Almond also said that in the past few months there
had been no new cases of CJD, the human form of the disease.
</P>
<P>
"The longer it goes on, the more confident we shall feel," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Britain Attacks Israel Over New Settlements in West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The British government has
strongly criticized Israel for expanding new settlements in the
West Bank, saying it could jeopardize the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The British Foreign Office said in a statement this afternoon
that it was "concerned by the escalation of tension in Jerusalem
and the occupied territories" following Israel's demolition of a
Palestinian community hall in the old city and the Israeli
government's decision to allow the expansion of settlements in the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that settlements are illegal and an obstacle to
peace. We call on both sides to implement the Interim Agreement
and to avoid taking precipitate actions which could throw the
peace process into a downward spiral," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"We regard it as particularly important that the commitments
not to disrupt the status quo in Jerusalem be respected pending
resolution of the Jerusalem issue under the terms of the Interim
Agreement," the statement added.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African
Development Community (SADC) Drama Festival will be held in
Mozambique in October although preparations for it have met
with dificulties.
</P>
<P>
An unidentified official in the Mozambican Ministry of
Culture, Youth and Sports made the statement today, according
to reports by the Mozambique Information Agency.
</P>
<P>
The main problem for the preparations for the Drama
Festival was the shortage of fund, the official said.
Preparations for the festival require 600,000 US Dollars, but
only 80,000 US Dollars have so far been raised.
</P>
<P>
Eight of the 12 SADC member states have expressed their
readiness to dispatch delegations to the festival. They are
South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique,
Namibia and Zimbabwe. enditem

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: History Proves Diaoyu Islands Are China's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Diaoyu islands, in the East
China Sea between China and Japan, have belonged to China since
ancient times.
</P>
<P>
The islands are 120 nautical miles northeast of Taiwan, 200
nautical miles west of China's mainland and 200 nautical miles
east of Japan's southernmost island Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
Geologically the islands are attached to Taiwan. The waters
around the islands are 100 to 150 meters deep and there is a
2,000-meter-deep oceanic trench between the islands and Japan's
Okinawa islands.
</P>
<P>
Fishermen from China's Taiwan and Fujian and other provinces
conducted activities such as fishing and collecting herbs in this
area since ancient times.
</P>
<P>
The islands appeared on China's map since the Ming Dynasty
(1368-1644).
</P>
<P>
There are records about the islands in a book published during
the rule of Yong Le (1403 to 1424) in the Ming Dynasty, more than
400 years before Japan claimed discovery of the Diaoyu islands in
1884.
</P>
<P>
After the Ming Dynasty, the islands were recorded in many
historical documents.
</P>
<P>
On a map published by Japan between 1783 and 1785, marking the
boundary of the Ryukyu Kingdom, the Diaoyu islands were shown as
belonging to China.
</P>
<P>
Japan never questioned China's sovereignty over the islands
before the Sino-Japanese war of 1894-1895.
</P>
<P>
In April 1895, the government of the Qing Dynasty was forced to
sign the Treaty of Shimonoseki, under which China ceded the whole
island of Taiwan and its surrounding islands including the Penghu
Islands to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Only since then has Japan had its own name for the area where
the Diaoyu islands are located. Before that, Japanese maps marked
the islands by their Chinese names.
</P>
<P>
Japan was occupied by the United Sates after it was defeated in
the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
In 1951, Japan and the United States illegally signed a treaty
in San Francisco without the presence of China, which was one of
the victor countries in the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
Although article two of the treaty said that Japan surrendered
its claim over Taiwan and the Penghu islands, article three
wrongly assigned the Diaoyu islands, which Japan had stolen from
China, and other islands, to the Ryukyu zone which was under
U.S. control.
</P>
<P>
The then Chinese premier Zhou Enlai lodged a strong protest and
said the Chinese government would never recognize the San
Francisco Treaty.
</P>
<P>
In a statement on territorial waters in 1958, the Chinese
government said that Japan should return all the territory of the
People's Republic of China including Taiwan and the islands around
it to China.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, there is no room for argument that the Diaoyu
islands have historically been a part of China's territory.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Contribute to African Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government has pledged to assist the African Development Bank
(ADB) replenish its African Development Fund in order to finance
development projects in low-income African countries, ADB
President Omar Kabbaj said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Johannesburg, Kabbaj said the
Ministry of Finance had declared South Africa's intention to
contribute an undisclosed amount to the fund.
</P>
<P>
The ADB, established over 30 years ago, has been focused on
assisting the poor nations of Africa to obtain loans and
development project fund.
</P>
<P>
The bank's 77 members include all the African nations and 24
non-regional countries.
</P>
<P>
South Africa became a full member of the bank in December 1995,
taking up a relatively small one percent stake.
</P>
<P>
The ADB has a capital base of about 30 billion U.S. Dollars
and its seventh general replenishment, to which South Africa will
contribute, has earmarked 3 billion U.S. Dollars to fund projects
and programs in low-income African nations over the next few
years.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Discusses Israeli-Palestinian Tension with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat today discussed the current tension
in ties with Israel with visiting Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul
Karim Kabariti.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders held talks in the West Bank town of Ramallah,
north to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Arafat requested Kabariti to brief King
Hussein on Israel's plans to expand Jewish settlements in the West
Bank in an effort to seek Jordan's support. Jordan is one of the
major allies of the PNA and also enjoys close relations with the
Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
Arafat was referring to the plan of building over 2,000 houses
in the territories approved by Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai. The building plan was first approved but later frozen
by the former Labor government in order to conduct peace talks
with Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the talks, Kabariti expressed his support to
the Palestinians, saying that Jordan could not accept Israel's
policies to expand Jewish settlements
</P>
<P>
Also today, in response to Arafat's call, Palestinians in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip as well as Arabs in east Jerusalem
observed a four-hour general strike from 8 a.m. to 12 a.m. local
time.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security forces were put on high alert against any
possible anti-Israeli violence after suspected terrorists attacked
Wednesday night a Jerusalem bus traveling on a road to Hebron,
wounding two passengers.
</P>
<P>
Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani today discussed with
senior police officers on measures to beef up security ahead of
the Friday prayers in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Faisal Husseini, PNA representative in Jerusalem,
warned that the situation in east Jerusalem was explosive. He
called on the Israeli government to ease the tension by releasing
the jailed Palestinian security personnels and implement the Oslo
accords.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo accords, the status of Jerusalem should be
settled through negotiations in the final-status talks, which
started in May but was frozen mainly due to the Israeli
elections.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economy Grows More Swiftly in Second Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy surged at a
4.8 percent annual rate in the second quarter, the fastest pace in
two years, U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate, close to the 4.9 percent annual growth rate in
the second quarter of 1994, was revised upwards from an initial
estimate of 4.2 percent announced a month ago.
</P>
<P>
U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) totaled 6.89 trillion dollars
in the second quarter after adjusting for inflation, as against
6.81 trillion dollars in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
There are few signs of inflationary pressure. A price index
tied to the GDP rose 2.1 percent at an annual rate, 0.2 percentage
points down from the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said that consumer spending, which
makes up about two thirds of GDP, increased at an annual rate of
3.4 percent rather than 3.7 percent reported previously. It was
little changed from the 3.5 percent advance in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Business investment in the second quarter rose 4 percent, 3.5
percentage points higher than the initial estimate. But the rise
was much lower than the 11.6 percent growth in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Inventory rebuilding added 10.2 billion dollars to GDP, less
than the 13.3 billion initially estimated. Inventory liquidation
took 17.6 billion dollars off first-quarter GDP.
</P>
<P>
Government spending, on the other hand, shot up 8.2 percent
after a 1.6 percent advance during the January-March period when
it was curbed by shutdowns.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. economy accelerated to a 2 percent growth rate from
January through March after a small 0.3 percent increase in the
last quarter in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The report is good news for President Bill Clinton as he
accepts the Democratic nomination for a second term. He claims the
strong economy is the result of his administration's policies.
</P>
<P>
But Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole maintains Clinton
inherited a good economy that has "gone sour" since Clinton took
office in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The latest GDP report has sparked new concerns that the U.S.
Federal Reserve (Fed) may raise the interest rates, although many
analysts and the Fed have predicted the economy will slow during
the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
So far evidence of a softer economy has been mixed. Housing
activity appears to have peaked and retail sales and industrial
production have slowed.
</P>
<P>
But a big surge in consumer confidence this month to a six-year
high suggested to economists that overall growth may not be
slowing as much as needed to forestall a rate hike.

<HEADLINE> Ciba, Sandoz's Net Profits Lower Than Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Net profits of Switzerland's two
largest drugs companies, who are planing to merge to beat off
tough international competition, fell well short of expectations,
media reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Ciba-Geigy, the number one Swiss drug company, saw its profits
for the first half of the year rise 6.3 percent to 1.59 billion
Swiss francs (1.33 billion U.S. dollars). But that was well below
the 12 percent increase expected by analysts.
</P>
<P>
Net profits at Sandoz grew by 11.6 percent to 1.24 billion
francs (about 1.1 billion dollars), but were also lower than
previous forecasts of a rise of 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
The two companies announced in March their initial plan to
merge into a new company called "Novartis" in a bid to compete in
international markets.
</P>
<P>
The merger, if successful, is expected to create the second
largest drug company in the world after Glaxo-Wellcome of Britain,
which is itself the result of merger last year between Glaxo and
Wellcome.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Central Organ of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) Mechanism for Conflict
Prevention, Management and Resolution met today and deliberated
on conflict situations in Burundi, Somalia and Liberia.
</P>
<P>
An OAU press release said the central organ reaffirmed its
earlier decisions on Burundi and in particular welcomed the
decisions made by the ministers of foreign affairs of the region,
which met in Kampala, Uganda, to set up a coordinating mechanism
for the implementation of the decisions on economic sanctions
against the military regime in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The press release said the central organ welcomed the
voluntary repatriation of Rwandese refugees from Burundi and
appealed to the international community to extend maximum support
to the government of Rwanda to absorb, resettle and rehabilitate
the returning refugees.
</P>
<P>
In its deliberation on situation in Somalia, the central
organ, among other things, reiterated that solution can only come
from efforts of the Somali factional leaders themselves. To this
end, the press release underscored the importance of dialogue and
consultations among all Somali factions.
</P>
<P>
The central organ also reviewed the situation in Liberia and
expressed warm welcome to the recent decisions made by heads of
state of the Economic Community of West African States.
</P>
<P>
The central organ urged the warring factions to scrupulously
implement the Liberian peace plan adopted in Abuja and aimed at
bringing about lasting peace in Liberia, the press release said.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Guerrillas Attacks Israeli Forces in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Guerrillas of the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, or Party of God, announced that they carried out an
ambush this afternoon targeting an Israeli patrol in the
so-called "security zone" in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Beirut tonight, the Islamic
Resistance, a military wing of Hezbollah, said one team of its
fighters carried out the operation near an Israeli position at
Blat in the western part of the 850-square-kilometer Israeli
occupied border strip at 5:40 p.m. (14:45 GMT).
</P>
<P>
It added that the guerrillas used rocket-propelled grenades
and machine-guns in the attack, "killing and wounding all
elements of the Israeli patrol."
</P>
<P>
Security sources in south Lebanon said that one Israeli
soldier was killed in the bombardment.
</P>
<P>
In a retaliation for the attacks, Israel's artillery shelled
the hills of Zibgin and Taher with some 50 shells, no casualties
were caused, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Today's operation brought the number of Israeli soldiers killed
in south Lebanon to 18 since this year, including 11 killed after
a 17-day Israeli blitz in south Lebanon in April.
</P>
<P>
The blitz ended after a cease-fire understanding was reached
between Lebanon and Israel, which bans the conflicting sides from
attacking at civilian targets or launching attacks from civilian
areas.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S.-brokered understanding does not prohibit
Moslem guerrillas from raiding the Israeli forces and their
client militia South Lebanon Army in the south Lebanese border
strip.
</P>
<P>
Inspecting the occupied buffer zone 10 days ago, Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu threatened that Israel would not
"stand still" if the Israeli forces and their allies in south
Lebanon were attacked.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the buffer zone, which was currently being
controlled by 1,200 Israeli troops and 2,500 militiamen of the
South Lebanon Army, in 1985 in a bid to prevent crossing-border
attacks at northern Israel.

PARIS, August 29 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today vowed to let France enter the European Monetary Union by
January 1, 1999, because the building of a unified monetary unit
in Europe serves the interests of all French people.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to French ambassadors meeting in Paris, Chirac said
that "the unified money should succeed" and "France will meet and
observe the expiry date."
</P>
<P>
"The unique money will allow the lowering of interest rates,
and thus more growth and more employment," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the monetary union "will put an end to
competitive devaluations (of national currencies), with the
condition that strict rules be fixed, as we have asked for, for
the relations between the euro and other European moneys."
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that to put into use the euro in 1999 will let
Europe carry weight in great financial debates at an equal stand
with the United States."

JOHANNESBURG, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Botswana Muslim
Association said today it does not support a South African Muslim
militant group fighting against drug lords, gangsters and
prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
The South African group, known as People Against Gangsterism
And Drugs (PAGAD), is based in the legislative capital of South
Africa, Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Botswanan association said in Gaborone that
his organisation does not have any links with PAGAD,according to
reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, however, said he does not believe PAGAD is
predominantly Muslims as reported by the media, which he claims to
have a tendence to blame Muslims for the wrong-doing of others.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made the statements following reports that PAGAD
has sent a letter to some of its agents in Botswana asking for
help in fighting drug lords in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Botswanan police said they are aware of the letter alleged to
have been sent by PAGAD and are taking the threats seriously.
</P>
<P>
PAGAD came into the limelight early this month when some of
its members were involved in the public execution of a suspected
leader of drug dealing group in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
The nation-wide organisation has yesterday threatened to
jeopardise Cape Town's bid to host the summer Olympic Games in
the year 2004.

CAIRO, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL) Secretary General
Esmat Abdul-Meguid telephoned Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
today to express the league's support for the Palestinians in the
face of what he called the Israeli provocative actions.
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Meguid made the phone call only one day after the
Cairo-based Arab League issued a statement condemning the reported
Israeli decision to build 900 new houses in a Jewish settlement in
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
He said that such Israeli provocations were designed to impose
a fait accompli by force, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Arafat today called a four-hour general strike in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip in protest against Israel's expansion of Jewish
settlements and its demolition of an Arab building in east
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israel demolished the building, which was used to carry out
charitable activities, under the pretext that it was financed by
the Palestinian National Authority.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli measures represent a flagrant attack on the
Palestinian people and jeopardize efforts currently exerted for
the resumption of Arab-Israeli peace negotiations, the chief of
the 22-member league said.
</P>
<P>
Arab countries are steadfastly committed themselves to
continuing the peace process, he told Arafat over the telephone.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League said in the strong-worded statement Wednesday
that Israel's expansion of settlements in the Palestinian lands
renders the Palestinian-Israeli final-status talks "meaningless and
insignificant".

PARIS, August 29 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today proposed to invite Russia to attend the summit of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to be held in early 1997.
</P>
<P>
Chirac told a meeting of French ambassadors in Paris that all
states which have a connection with NATO should be "associated
with" the NATO summit, which will discuss which of the eastern
European countries should be admitted as new members of the
organization.
</P>
<P>
He said that Russia has chosen democracy and reforms through as
was shown in its presidential election in July, in which Boris
Yeltsin was reelected.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that while fully supporting the absorption of the
former members of the East Bloc into NATO, France is opposed to a
"restricted" approach in the expansion of the Western military
group.
</P>
<P>
"Such an approach could provoke a new rupture of our continent
by excluding Russia and leaving a part of central Europe, eastern
Europe and the Baltics in a dangerous gap," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that if Russia is invited to the summit, the encounter
will be "the most important since the fracture of Yalta."
</P>
<P>
The wartime leaders of the Soviet Union, the United States and
Britain agreed upon a division of spheres of influence at the
Yalta meeting in 1945.

ADDIS ABABA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian government
today ordered the halting of raising aid underway in some
localities to victims of overflowing Awash River and said the
government has the capacity to deal with the flood crisis.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the local newsmen, Commissioner of Disaster
Prevention and Preparedness Simon Mechale said the commision's
central warehouses in Nazaret Combolacha and Direda are stocked
with 70,261 tons of wheat, biscuit and enriched FaFa flour
compared to the small amount of emergency relief distributed so
far.

<P>
The food reserve is enough even for other purpose, he
stressed, adding that the food is reserved to give a prompt
response to emergency situations anticipated particularly for
this year.
</P>
<P>
The government has made no appeal for aid to the Awash River
flood crisis, although the cost of the damage done to both human
and property could by no means be considered low, Simon said.
</P>
<P>
He said even though philanthropists and aid agencies have
volunteered to render assistance, the government did not accept
the offer as the situation had not gone out of its control.
</P>
<P>
Unless the government appeals for aid, attempts to raise
assista ce to flood victims is illegal, the commissioner added.

<HEADLINE> Farrakhan Defies US Ban on Travels to Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Treasury has
rejected Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan's application for
a license for a trip to Tripoli to receive a gift of 1 billion
U.S. dollars from the Libyan government.
</P>
<P>
But Farrakhan, defying the ban, is now in Tripoli, said local
reports today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. rejection came Wednesday when the Treasury's Office of
Foreign Assets Control sent a letter to Farrakhan's lawyer, Rufus
Cook, and Nation of Islam General Counsel Arif Muhammad, saying it
decided to deny Farrakhan's request for two licenses to receive 1
billion dollars in funds and a 250,000 dollar humanitarian prize
from Libya in light of U.S. sanctions laws and U.S. foreign policy
objectives.
</P>
<P>
"It would be inconsistent with current U.S. foreign policy to
authorize U.S. individuals or organizations to accept donations or
honoraria from Moammar Gadhafi or others acting on behalf of the
government of Libya," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
But Farrakhan, defying the U.S. ban, left the United States
Wednesday and is now in Tripoli for the 1 billion dollar gift and
the international humanitarian award named after Libyan leader
Moammar Gadhafi, according to Libya's news agency.
</P>
<P>
Farrakhan was reported to tell Libya's news agency that he
was grateful to "the Libyan people, brother Moammar Gadhafi and
also the committee which decided to award us Gadhafi's
international prize for human rights this year."
</P>
<P>
It is Farrakhan's second trip to Libya. Last January, he
visited the country and met with Libyan leader Gadhafi, who
praised him for his fighting for justice in calling for the
Million Man March in Washington, D.C., last year.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Gadhafi pledged 1 billion dollars to the
Nation of Islam to foster economic development in the
African-American community.
</P>
<P>
Recently, a nine-member committee based in Geneva, Switzerland,
has nominated Farrakhan as this year's winner of the international
humanitarian prize.
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday' news conference in Chicago, where the religious
group Nation of Islam is based, Farrakhan said he would use the 1
billion dollar donation to establish a job-creation program to aid
those who will lose welfare benefits under the reform legislation
signed into law by President Bill Clinton.

LUSAKA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Former Zambian president Kenneth
Kaunda said here today that he is ready to meet President
Frederick Chiluba to discuss the amended constitution.
</P>
<P>
However, at a press conference Kaunda linked his readiness
with the release of detained opposition leaders.
</P>
<P>
He said South African President Nelson Mandela has urged him
to meet Chiluba to resolve the issues that could stand in the way
of peaceful elections.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda said that the amended constitution should be one of the
issues to be tabled at the proposed inter-party meeting.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba announced last Sunday that he will meet Kaunda and
other opposition leaders to discuss the political matters.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday the opposition Inter-Party Alliance, which
includes the biggest opposition United National Independence
Party (UNIP) led by Kaunda, demanded the release of eight
detained UNIP leaders as a precondition for the proposed dialog
with Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
The government rejected the demand immediately, dismissing it
"unacceptable".
</P>
<P>
After some bomb blasts rocked the country in May and June, the
eight UNIP leaders were arrested on charges of involvment in the
bomb blasts and being behind the terrorism group alleged
responsible for the blasts.
</P>
<P>
Under the amended constitution Kaunda cannot stand in the
forthcoming elections becuase his parents are foreign immigrants.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Political Adviser Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHICAGO, August 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton's
top political adviser, Dick Morris, resigned today after a tabloid
reported that he had a relationship with a prostitute.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by the White House today, Morris said he
resigned Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
"While I served I sought to avoid the limelight because I did
not want to become the message. Now, I resign so I will not become
the issue," Morris said.
</P>
<P>
The resignation came just a day before Clinton's address to
accept the Democratic nomination tonight. The Morris controversy
could disrupt the Democratic campaign meetings.
</P>
<P>
Morris, who had left Chicago for his home in Connecticut, said
in his statement that he was honored to help the president "come
back from being buried in a landslide and make it possible for him
to have a second chance at a second term." He called Clinton "a
great president and a great man."
</P>
<P>
Clinton issued a statement today saying, "Dick Morris is my
friend, and he is a superb political strategist. I am and always
will be grateful for the great contribution he has made to my
campaigns, and for the invaluable work he has done for me over the
last two years."
</P>
<P>
The former Republican consultant, who worked for Clinton in the
1980s, thanked the Democratic Party for allowing him to return.
</P>
<P>
The New York Post published an account of a story from the Star
that said two days before the start of the Democratic convention,
Morris showed Sherry Rowlands, an honorable adventure, copies of
the speeches Hillary Rodham Clinton and Vice President Al Gore
would deliver days later.
</P>
<P>
The paper said on another occasion early in their relationship,
Morris called the president and held out the telephone so Miss
Rowlands could hear Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The Post said it obtained the information from the Star, a
supermarket tabloid newspaper, which in turn had purchased it for
an undisclosed amount from the woman, Sherry Rowlands, 37.

today following an early adoption of the National Assembly this
month, said a source reaching here.
</P>
<P>
During the debate prior to the voting, Finance Minister Trevor
Manuel assured senators the implementation of the government's
recently released macro-economic strategy is on track, and the
country's economic fundamentals are sound despite the present
currency fluctuation.
</P>
<P>
It is not necessary to "call a press conference every day" to
tell the public what progress has been made, said the minister,
adding the strategy is integrated and could not be implemented
"within one month".
</P>
<P>
In this regard, he stressed that the government policy has to
focus on the medium and long-term economic goals.
</P>
<P>
However, before the voting in the senate, the Freedom Front
raised its objections to a number of departments'
allocations, including agriculture, correctional services and
safety and security, with the objection being supported by
the National Party.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Willing to Receive UN Mission on Bakassi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has informed the United
Nations that it will be willing to receive the UN goodwill
mission on the Bakassi Peninsula, which has been a source of
incessant dispute between Nigeria and Cameroun since 1994.
</P>
<P>
The decision has been conveyed to the UN Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali in a letter from Nigeria's head of state
General Sani Abacha, a UN spokesperson said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A report obtained here today said that the UN has stepped up
its efforts to mediate in the dispute since February 3 when the
conflict flared up again.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general has sent the two special envoys to
Nigeria several times this year as part of the efforts to find a
lasting solution to the problem.
</P>
<P>
Cameroun took the dispute to the UN Security Council in 1994
and early this year, and the council, on both occasions, wrote to
the two countries urging them to seek a peaceful settlement of
the dispute.
</P>
<P>
Cameroun also has put the dispute before the International
Court of Justice, which in a provisional ruling on March 15
called on the two countries to observe the ceasefire they reached
in Togo and to desist from any action that could prejudice the
rights of the other in respect of a final judgement.

JOHANNESBURG, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Botswanan government
has spent more than 32 million US Dollars to pay off farmers
whose cattle had been killed in an effort to eradicate the
infectious Bovine lung disease.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Chirac Proposes Meeting on Bosnia, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 29 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today proposed hosting a meeting of the future leaders of Bosnia
and the international directive committee on Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The president also suggested that a conference be held between
the 15 members of the European Union (EU) and all the candidate
countries for EU.
</P>
<P>
Chirac made the statements in a speech to a meeting of French
ambassadors, who were recalled home by the French government to
discuss new initiatives in France's diplomatic policy, notably the
launching of an economic offensive to help French enterprises
export their products.
</P>
<P>
The president said that since Bosnia has moved from "a logic
of separation of forces" to "a logic stage of cooperation
between communities," France has proposed to its partners to
apply "a two-year plan of civil consolidation" for Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"This plan could be adopted, after the (Bosnian) elections
(which will begin) on September 14, during a conference in Paris
of the future leaders of Bosnia and the Ministerial Directive
Committee on Bosnia-Herzegovina," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Beyond Bosnia, it should contribute to a stabilization of the
whole region, preparing thus a progressive rapprochement between
the countries of former Yugoslavia and the European Union," said
Chirac.
</P>
<P>
The directive committee on Bosnia was set up by the Group of
Seven industrialized countries, Russia, the European Union, and
the Organization of Islamic Conference to follow up the
application of civil aspects in the Dayton peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the countries which send troops to Bosnia to
join the U.N. peacekeeping mission should maintain a solidarity
and withdraw all together their troops at the same time from
Bosnia once the mandate of the peace-keeping mission ends in
December.
</P>
<P>
On the holding of an enlarged EU conference which will include
all EU candidates, Chirac said that such a conference should not
be a place for negotiations but "a forum of coordination and
political dialogue where all subjects of common interests will be
treated."

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. General Assembly
(GA) on Thursday decided to renew the mandate of the International
Civilian Mission to Haiti (MICIVIH) until 31 December.
</P>
<P>
Adopting without a vote a resolution introduced by the
representative of Chile, the Assembly authorized the United
Nations, together with the Organization of American States (OAS),
to verify Haiti's full observance of human rights and fundamental
freedoms, to provide technical assistance such as the training of
its police and to support the development of a program to promote
and protect human rights.
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly took the action under a request of Haitian
President Rene Preval, who stated that while his government was
continuing to achieve satisfactory efforts in strengthening
democratic institutions and increasing respect for human rights,
it still had a long way to go before those institutions would be
strong enough to fully play their expected roles.
</P>
<P>
Indicating that the mission still had an important role to
play, President Preval requested an extension of its presence in
Haiti.
</P>
<P>
MICIVIH was established on 20 April 1993. It is a joint
operation of the United Nations and the Organization of American
States. Now the United Nations has 32 observers in the mission.

<HEADLINE> New York Schools Plagued by Enrollment Surge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 29 (Xinhua) -- New York City's public schools
are plagued by the enrollment surge this year, the New York Times
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of the 1.06 million students will report to class
next week at such places as a converted World War 11 torpedo
factory, a renovated department store, the upper floors of the
Town Hall theater and dozens of temporary aluminum trailers
scattered in schoolyards across the city.
</P>
<P>
School officials described the condition as "more crowded than
at any time since the height of the Baby Boom four decades ago",
forcing them to beg, borrow and lease classroom space anywhere
they could find it, especially in underused commercial buildings
across the city.
</P>
<P>
School officials said that there are 91,000 students more than
the system's 1,100 schools were built to house. They attributed
the enrollment surge to a stream of young immigrants from Mexico,
Dominica and Asia and an increasing number of students who spend
more than four years in high schools.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the enrollment in the city's schools has
climbed by an average of 20,000 students in each of the last six
years.
</P>
<P>
The Board of Education estimated that a decade from now the
system would have almost 1.3 million students, which would require
the construction of enough space for 300,000 students by the year
2004. But as of now the Board's five-year capital plan has enough
money to build space for only 30,000 students.

<HEADLINE> Mulroney Libel Trial Set for January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Former Canadian Prime Minister
Brian Mulroney's libel trial against the federal government is set
to begin January 6, local newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
The trial date was worked out between the lawyers of Mulroney
and the Canadian government Wednesday in the Quebec Superior
Court.
</P>
<P>
Mulroney launched the 50-millions-Canadian-dollars suit in
November, 1995, after he learned that the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police (RCMP) alleged in a confidential letter to Swiss
authorities that he received millions in kickbacks in the 1988 Air
Canada purchase of Airbus passenger planes.
</P>
<P>
The RCMP letter was meant to obtain evidence that bribes had
been deposited with the Swiss Bank Corp.
</P>
<P>
Mulroney has denied any wrongdoing, and said that he wanted his
name cleared in court and got compensated financially.
</P>
<P>
The trial, which is already one of the most publicized civil
cases in Canadian legal history, is expected to last until the end
of March.

<HEADLINE> Canada to See First Account Surplus in 14 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Canada is set to run a surplus in
its financial dealings with the rest of the world for the first
time since 1982.
</P>
<P>
Statistics Canada's report on the balance of payments for the
April-June period is expected to show that the country had an
annualized surplus of about 440 million U.S. dollars in the
current account, the Globe and Mail newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The current account measures the flow of payments for the
export and imports of goods and services and for interest on
bonds.
</P>
<P>
Soaring exports and sluggish imports have produced a burgeoning
surplus in the trade of goods, while the usual deficit in the
trade of services has dwindled, mainly because more foreign
tourists are visiting Canada.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the deficit in interest payments is falling because
interest rates here are dropping and governments are borrowing
less aboard.
</P>
<P>
A surplus in the second quarter is almost guaranteed, since
Statistics Canada has already reported that Canada exported about
7.3 billion U.S. dollars more worth of goods than it imported
during the period.
</P>
<P>
That will be enough to cover what has become a declining
deficit in the trade of services and falling interest payments to
foreigners who hold Canadian bonds, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the good news, Canada will wind up with a small deficit
for the year as a whole. But it will run a surplus in 1997, the
paper added.

<HEADLINE> Enforcement of Anti-Child Labor Laws Urged in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 30 (Xinhua) -- A senior Nepali justice today
urged the government to take effective measures to enforce child
protection laws especially those against child labor in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Any failure to initiate timely measures at the national level
to address the problem of child labor would give rise to social
degradation of the nation, Chief Justice Surendra Singh warned
while opening a three-day workshop on children's rights
protection.
</P>
<P>
About 530,000 Nepali children between 10 and 14 are employed
directly or indirectly in one profession or the other, let alone
the plight of the street children, he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Nepal has ratified the 1989 United Nations
Convention on Children's Rights and the country's constitution
prohibits the use of child labor, he said what the most required
is the effective enforcement of law in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Other participants of the workshop, jointly organized by
Nepal's Tribhuvan University and the International Labor
Organization (ILO), claimed that despite various national and
international programs launched for the protection of children in
the country, Nepali children have not benefited from them to the
desired extent.
</P>
<P>
Child labor is not an isolated problem but related to the
overall national socio-economic development, they said.
</P>
<P>
The participants suggested a multi-disciplinary approach be
adopted to find the meaningful solution to the problem.

PHNOM PENH, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Former Khmer Rouge leader
Ieng Sary announced Thursday he had left the guerrilla group to
found a new movement to work for peace and reconciliation in the
country, the Kampuchea daily newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The new Democratic National United Movement will try to end the

In a communique broadcast over Cambodia's state radio on August
16, Ieng Sary said that he had left the Khmer Rouge and would act
as the leader of the breakaway movement.
</P>
<P>
He said some of the Khmer Rouge troops stationed in
northwestern and northeastern Cambodia would be under his control.
</P>
<P>
The Khmer Rouge were driven out of government and into the
jungles by Vietnamese troops who invaded Cambodia in early
1979. The Vietnamese left in 1989.

<HEADLINE> 14 US States Ban Same-Sex Marriages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Alabama has become the 14th
state in the U.S. to officially prohibit same-sex marriages as
Gov. Fob James Thursday signed an executive order banning
recognition of such marriages in the state, said an Associated
Press report today.
</P>
<P>
The order, which is effective immediately, prohibits the issue
of marriage licenses to any homosexual couple. Such marriages in
other states or foreign countries "shall not be recognized as a
valid marriage in this state," the order said.
</P>
<P>
Alabama's move was on the background that there was a pending
legislation in Hawaii to legalize homosexual marriages. Alabama
and other states fear that they would have to recognize the
marriages of gay couples who wed in Hawaii without a banning law.
</P>
<P>
The Hawaii Supreme Court ruled in May 1993 that the denial of
marriage licenses to three same-sex couples was discriminatory
under the state's Equal Rights Amendment, unless the state can
show a compelling interest in keeping the ban. A trial was
scheduled for September 10, according to the news report.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Mississippi Gov. Kirk Fordice signed a similar order
to ban the recognition of same-sex marriages in the state.
</P>
<P>
Legislative bans also have been adopted in 12 other states --
Alaska, Arizona, Delaware, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas,
Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee and Utah.
</P>
<P>
Also, the U.S. House of Representatives has passed the Defense
of Marriage Act, prohibiting federal recognition of gay marriages.
The Senate is expected to take up the measure next month.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton has said that he would sign the
bill.

<HEADLINE> Israel Decides to Appoint Negotiators with PNA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Under mounting pressure from
the Palestinians, the Israeli cabinet today approved the decision
by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to appoint a team of
negotiators for talks with the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA).
</P>
<P>
The decision was approved amid growing tension between Israel
and the Palestinians, as thousands of Arab Moslems gathered in the
Old City of Jerusalem responding to a call by Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat to pray at the Al Aqsa Mosque for the Friday prayers.
</P>
<P>
The call was viewed as a measure to pressure the Israeli
government into halting the Jewish settlements in the West Bank
and the Gaza, along with an emphasis on the Palestinians' claims
to East Jerusalem as a future capital.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Palestinians held a four-hour protest strike in
the Gaza Strip, the West Bank and east Jerusalem in the first open
confrontation with Israel since Netanyahu's government took office
in June.
</P>
<P>
Strikes were a common protest tool during the 1987-1993
Intifada (Palestinian uprising) against Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's call to prayer, his second showdown with Israel's
hardline government in two days, was also intended to test
Israel's contention that it ensures freedom of worship in the city
holy to Jews, Moslems and Christians.
</P>
<P>
Under Israel's six-month closure of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, however, most Palestinians are barred from Jerusalem,
resulting in a lower turnout than planned.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians are particularly angry over the expansion of
Jewish settlements and the Netanyahu cabinet's refusal to resume
substantive negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has refused to meet with Arafat or to commit himself
to Israel's four-month-overdue troop withdrawal from Hebron, the
last West Bank city still under Israeli control.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli prime minister has also ruled out negotiations over
Palestinian demands for an independent state with east Jerusalem
as a capital.
</P>
<P>
Talks on carrying out the remainder of the Israeli-Palestinian
autonomy agreements, including a Hebron troop redeployment, were
slated to start next week, Israel radio said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops, on high alert, set up roadblocks around
Jerusalem and in the West Bank today, turning away Palestinians
without a permit to enter Jerusalem. Some 2,000 Israeli police
were deployed throughout east Jerusalem, including 1,000 officers
called in as a reinforcement.
</P>
<P>
In the east Jerusalem neighborhood of Ras el-Amud, about half a
kilometer from the Al Aqsa Mosque, Israeli police turned away not
only West Bank residents, but also those with Jerusalem identity
cards who can usually move freely.
</P>
<P>
Some 100,000 Moslems were predicted to pray on Al Aqsa today,
but only about 15,000 worshipers reached the site.

<HEADLINE> Economic Cooperation Along Lancang-Mekong River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- China's Vice-Premier Jiang
Chunyun reiterated that China is willing to become involved in
economic cooperation with neighboring countries in the
Lancang-Mekong River valley, on an equal basis.
</P>
<P>
At the sixth ministerial-level meeting on economic cooperation
in the Lancang-Mekong River sub-region which opened here today,
Jiang said that China will continue its efforts in developing
friendly relations with neighboring countries to safeguard peace
and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and that the Chinese
government is willing to vigorously develop the sub-regional
economic cooperation with relevant countries, on the basis of
equality and consultation, mutual benefit and common development,
and contribute to accelerating the cooperation process.
</P>
<P>
He said that the countries involved -- Myanmar, Thailand, Laos,
Cambodia and Vietnam -- are all friendly neighbors of China and
have had close contacts with China historically, which have
created conditions for the sub-regional cooperation, and that
these countries' customs have a great deal in common with those in
China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
Bong-Suh Lee, vice-president of the Asian Development Bank,
which sponsored the meeting, said that the bank has pinpointed 95
projects for priority action in the Lancang-Mekong River valley
and that the bank has invested 280 million US dollars in loans in
some of the projects.

<HEADLINE> Bank Calls Subregion Cooperation Meeting a Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The sixth ministerial conference
on economic cooperation in the sub-region along the Lancang-Mekong
River has made considerable progress, a senior official of the
Asian Development Bank, said here today.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the conference reached a consensus on
cooperation in power generation, tourism, investment, aviation,
environmental protection and telecommunications, according to
Bong-Suh Lee, vice-president of ADB, sponsor of the conference,
which ended this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Nearly a hundred projects will start in the next few years as
the cooperation enters the implementation stage, after four years
of preparation, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
The Lancang-Mekong runs through Yunnan Province in China,
Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam, covering 2.3
million sq kms, an area that has a total population of 230 million.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that special attention has been paid to developing
human resources, environmental protection, and choosing
cooperative projects in ways that benefit everyone.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN sent observers to the conference, indicating a promising
future for cooperation, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
International organizations such as the UN Development Program,
the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank have all made a
commitment to the development.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, five ministerial-level meetings of the countries
involved have been held to discuss cooperation.

<HEADLINE> PNA Condemns Israeli Siege on Jerusalem (by Wang Yukui) (I) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) today strongly condemned the Israeli government
for imposing a siege around Jerusalem, which had prevented a high
turnout of Arab Moslems for Friday Prayers at the Al-Aqsa Mosque
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by the PNA's Information Ministry,
the PNA stressed that Israeli government's action today "proves
that the extremist Netanyahu government is determined to blow
up the peace process."
</P>
<P>
The statement warned that the continuation of such actions
"will push toward the circle of violence and sabotage the
peace process."
</P>
<P>
"We also warn that the Palestinian people will not alone
pay the bill for impairing the peace process, and will not
stand motionless before such cruel measures," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The statement also called on the international community to
intervene for the sake of implementing all agreements concluded
between Israel and the PNA and "to desist the policy of
procrastination."
</P>
<P>
Only over 10,000 Palestinian Moslem worshipers, one third of
the regular number, arrived for the Friday prayers today at the
Al-Aqsa Mosque in the Old City of Jerusalem, as a result of the
tougher Israeli closure on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Many Palestinians were turned back this morning by Israeli
army and police at the checkpoints at the entrance to
Jerusalem, and were unable to participate in Moslem Friday
prayers in the holy city.
</P>
<P>
Some 100,000 Palestinians were originally expected to respond
to PNA President Yasser Arafat's call to participate in today's
massive Friday prayers in a protest against Israeli government's
polices.
</P>
<P>
Arafat asked both Palestinian and Israeli Arab Moslems to
come to pray at the Al-Aqsa Mosque, to protest the Israeli
government's decision on expanding Jewish settlements in the
West Bank and limiting Palestinian activities in Jerusalem.

<TEXT>
<P>
This is the second part of a series of protests called for
by Arafat following Thursday's four-hour general strike, the first
time in two years.
</P>
<P>
The strike was observed by the Palestinians in the West Bank
and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Palestinian Radio said that those who could
not reach Jerusalem, due to the half-year closure, were
told to gather at the checkpoints at the entrance to the
city.
</P>
<P>
If they were turned back, they might go and pray on
land designated for expropriation by the Israeli authorities, to
protest settlement expansion, the report added.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 Israeli policemen were deployed in Jerusalem
today for fear of a possible unrest at the Al-Aqsa Mosque.
</P>
<P>
"We are taking (Arafat's call) seriously," Internal Security
Minister Avigdor Kahalani was quoted by today's Jerusalem Post
as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We will not allow inciters onto the Temple Mount (where
Al-Aqsa stands)," Kahalani said, "if we have to we will
using force, but I hope we will not have to."
</P>
<P>
Israeli Police Inspector-General Assaf Hefetz said that police
would not allow protest marches by Palestinians in eastern
Jerusalem today, which he said "may lead to disturbances."
</P>
<P>
Those who have no authorization to enter Jerusalem will not
be allowed to enter, Hefetz said, and roadblocks will be
manned by both police and the Israeli army.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani held a special meeting with Hefetz and other police
brass Thursday to discuss stringent security arrangements in the
wake of Arafat's call.
</P>
<P>
After today's prayers, police sources told Israel Radio that
the low attendance may be due to the fact that the Palestinians
have sought to avoid confrontations with the police at the
roadblocks in the city.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Israeli cabinet decided today
that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will head a team of
negotiators to conduct negotiations with Palestinians, starting
with the Hebron troop redeployment.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to ease mounting tensions, Israel and the
Palestinians Thursday agreed to convene a meeting of the steering
committee next week, the first time since the new Israeli
government assumed power in June, to further the implementation
of the Oslo accords.

SANAA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Yement and Saudi Arabia have
signed an agreement on cooperation in the economic, trade,
investment and technological fields in a bid to serve the common
interests of the two countries, according to an official Yemeni
source today.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed at the presidential palace here

deputy prime minister and minister of defense, Prince Sultan Ibn
Abdel-Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Sultan was accompanied by several cabinet ministers and other

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The flag of the 50 Hong Kong
Workshop of the British Garrison was lowered this afternoon at Sek
Kong, the New Territories, to mark the Workshop's closure, which
is the first step of the withdrawal of the British Garrison in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The 50 Hong Kong Workshop was formed in 1946 in Sham Shui Po
and in 1984 it was relocated to the current place at Sek Kong
Military Station. The Workshop involved the manufacture,
maintenance, recovery and repair of military equipment within the
Garrison.
</P>
<P>
At this afternoon's closing ceremony, a parade was staged, with
soldiers from the Workshop and a music band participating.
Commander of the British Garrison, Major General Bryan Dutton,
also attended the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference yesterday, Dutton announced the detailed
plans for the withdrawal of the British Hong Kong Garrison, which
will be completed on June 30, 1997 when China resumes the exercise
of sovereignty over Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
According to the plans, the next step of the withdrawal will be
the disbandment of the 67 Gurkha Independent Field Squadron on
September 6.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Women Spikers Upset Cuba at World GP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SENDAI, Japan, August 30 (Xinhua) -- China beat Olympic
champions Cuba 3-0 in the opening match of the World Women's
Volleyball Grand Prix preliminaries here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
China, who lost to Cuba 1-3 at the Olympic final earlier this
month to claim the silver, had to came from 8-13 behind in the
first set before tying the score 13-all on Wu Yongmei's clever
dropping.
</P>
<P>
China took the set after a Wu blocking and ace hitter Sun Yue's
deep spike.
</P>
<P>
The Cubans, without their Olympic stars Magalys Cavajal and
Mireya Luis, did not cause much trouble in the second set, where
Wu and Sun each scored two consecutive points to help China win
15-8.
</P>
<P>
China surged to a comfortable 14-4 lead in the third set, only
to see Cuba haul back to 14-12 after taking eight consecutive
points.
</P>
<P>
Substitute Wang Lina replaced an exhausted Sun to score the
game point with a cross-court smash.
</P>
<P>
Sun had nine points to lead the Chinese spikers. Regla Torres
scored 11 for Cuba.
</P>
<P>
"China was slow to wake up today. We improved later and got
accustomed to Cuba's style," said Chinese coach Lang Ping.
</P>
<P>
She added, "Cuba was in good form. But China didn't have good
endurance and was slower in blocking and attaching (than at the
Olympics). So we saw the Cubans surged back to 12 points."
</P>
<P>
Cuban coach Antonio Perdomo said his team was experiencing
great difficulties without three Olympic players.
</P>
<P>
"It is extremely difficult to fight a team like China without
Luis and Magalys," said Antonio.
</P>
<P>
Antonio denied the media reports that the duo had retired after
the Atlanta Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"They are on vacation," said Antonio. "The two players,
especially 33-year-old Luis, are sick and they need to rest."
</P>
<P>
But he said it was not clear at present whether Luis will wear
national color again.
</P>
<P>
In the other match, Olympic bronze medalist Russia overcame a
one-set deficit to defeat host Japan 10-15, 15-12, 15-9 and 15-11.
</P>
<P>
Russian coach Nikolai Karpol gave much credit to the opponents,
saying it played better than at Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Japan's coach Kuzuwa Nobuchika said his team played better than
what he expected but needed improvement in receiving and
co-operation between the players.
</P>
<P>
He said he did not care about the withdrawl of two key players
from Japan's Daiei Club.
</P>
<P>
"I will use higher and talented new players. I think we could
progress rapidly," he added.

<HEADLINE> Greek Couples Wary of Having Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- More and more young Greeks are
reluctant to have children or even get married because of
socio-economic factors and fear of failure, a senior social
scientist has said.
</P>
<P>
Haris Kataki, chairman of the Research Laboratory for Human
Relations, was quoted today by the newspaper Ta Nea as saying,
"Many young people are not only afraid of getting married, but
also afraid of co-habitating. When they realize they cannot build
strong relationships, they get the impression they would fail as
parents as well."
</P>
<P>
She said raising a child today presents many difficulties, both
practical and economic.
</P>
<P>
"We have reached the point where couples discuss having one
child or no children at all."
</P>
<P>
But she said couples also feared that having children would
force them into accepting situations which in different
circumstances they would reject.
</P>
<P>
More and more Greek women are finding it hard to balance their
family responsibilities with their careers and social needs,
Kataki was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The average size of the Greek family has been falling for many
years, but the trend has been accelerating.
</P>
<P>
The average number of children born to a Greek woman of
child-bearing age was 2.23 in 1960, 1.82 in 1984 and 1.35 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
There were 56,000 fewer births in 1995 than in 1960, according
to the National Statistics Service's Population Growth Department.
</P>
<P>
Changes in tradition have also accounted for the falling birth
rate. The idea that a large number of children means "an increase
in the power of the family" is a thing of the past, Kataki was
quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Condemns Serb Police Over Mob Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations today
blasted the Bosnian Serb police for failing to stop an angry mob
besieging an international police station in a Serb-controlled
town.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Ivanko, spokesman for the U.N. International Police
Task Force (IPTF) which has monitoring police stations throughout
Bosnia, said the IPTF is "outraged and disgusted" by Thursday's
event in Zvornik, some 40 kilometers southeast of Tuzla.
</P>
<P>
More than 600 Serbs attacked Zvornik police station, taking six
U.N. police officers hostage for six hours and destroying several
vehicles parked outside.
</P>
<P>
Serb police looked on passively and even roughed up some U.N.
officers, Ivanko said.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. condemns the action of Republika Srpska police in the
strongest possible terms...and expects swift and decisive action
against those who organized and led the mob in the Zvornik
rampage," Ivanko said.
</P>
<P>
The event was apparently in retaliation for NATO peacekeeping
forces' detention of 45 Serb policemen earlier in the day for
bringing weapons into the demilitarized zone.
</P>
<P>
NATO had agreed to temporarily patrol the area, which straddles
an administrative boundary between Serb and Muslim-Croat entities.
</P>
<P>
The armed police were attempting to evict Muslim refugees who
had returned to Mahala, a village on the Serb side of the zone.
</P>
<P>
NATO forces confiscated the weapons of the Serb police. Their
release later that evening ended the siege of Zvornik's police
station.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Wei Jianxing, secretary of the
Central Commission For Discipline Inspection of the Chinese
Communist Party (CPC), said recently that China is still
confronted with a tough situation in its anti-corruption campaign
and urged supervision and discipline inspection officials to work
even harder.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting on fighting corruption, Wei, who is also a member
of the politburo and the secretariat of the CPC Central Committee,
said that supervision and discipline inspection officials should
try to find any loopholes in systems, laws, regulations, policies,
and management that allow corruption to continue and to plug these.
</P>
<P>
A better supervision system should be established within the
the Party, he pointed out. It is necessary to strengthen the
supervisory function of the discipline inspection and supervision
departments as well as of other sources, including the
participation of the masses in the supervision, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese prosecutors had handled 26,667 cases of corruption and
embezzlement during the first five months this year, including
investigations of 1,151 party and government officials above the
county-head level. More than 1.5 billion yuan (180.7 million US
dollars) of direct state and collective economic losses were
recovered from handling of these cases.

<HEADLINE> Balancing Copyright Protection And Information Access </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The International Federation of
Library Associations and Institutes (IFLA) has said in a report
that copyright protection should not be in conflict with its
original aim to promote science and art, and called for a balance
between copyright protection and access to information.
</P>
<P>
Sandy Norman, IFLA's copyright advisor, briefed delegates to
the 62nd IFLA General Conference in Beijing on the results of a
pre-conference seminar on copyrights held in Tianjin, from August
21 to 24.
</P>
<P>
"It was particularly appropriate to hold a seminar on
copyrights in the People's Republic of China, as China, not
Western Europe, was the birthplace of copyrights," the report of
the seminar said.
</P>
<P>
The seminar discussed challenges to copyrights in the digital
age. Some 56 delegates from Asia, Africa, Latin America, North
America, Western Europe participated in the seminar.
</P>
<P>
"Many speakers stressed the importance of maintaining the
balance between copyright protection, both legal and technical,
and giving access to information, and thus, knowledge," Norman
said in her report delivered at today's closing session of the
conference. She stressed that publishers, authors and librarians
are part of the information chain, and need each other.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from developing countries also gave examples of the
frustration of having limited resources to purchase library
materials and having to adhere strictly to the demands of
copyright compliance.
</P>
<P>
The delegates also discussed copyright ethics. "We questioned
what would happen to knowledge if all knowledge had to be paid
for," said Norman in her report, when delegates came up with
whether the growing trend towards copyright protection for purely
economic reasons was in conflict with the original aims of
copyrights to promote the progress of science and art.
</P>
<P>
Norman said that delegates agreed to recommend more education
and guidance be given on copyright matters. They also agreed to
make the IFLA statement on Copyrights in the Electronic
Environment more public so that it can be a starting point for
governments who are drafting intellectual property legislation.

<HEADLINE> HK's Trading Center Status Stable: Economists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The economists of the Standard
Chartered Bank said worries over Hong Kong losing its trading
center status is misplaced.
</P>
<P>
In a monthly issue of the Bank "Greater China Viewpoints," the
economists said that the slowdown in growth of Hong Kong's trade
numbers should not be taken as a sign that Hong Kong's trading
center is diminishing, and instead, it is the result of Hong Kong
moving further towards services-based economy.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, goods moving in and out of China go
through Hong Kong in the form of transshipment instead of
re-exports.
</P>
<P>
It said that this reflects the increase in manufacturing and
cargo handling capabilities of China, which makes it unnecessary
for such cargo to go through any further processing in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the report noted that more and more goods, which
are produced in and shipped to other countries and do not even
pass through Hong Kong's port, are being handled by companies in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
However, the report noted, while an increasing proportion of
the total trade is not handled in the territory, Hong Kong will
still prosper as a provider of trade-related business and
financial services.
</P>
<P>
Actually, it said, the efficiency of Hong Kong lies in areas
such as telecommunications, transport, banking and finance, legal,
accounting and other business services, underpinned by a stable
business environment with minimal bureaucratic red tape.
</P>
<P>
It said that Hong Kong provides a competitive advantage to
local firms to do business around the world.
</P>
<P>
Overseas companies also find Hong Kong a convenient and
efficient place for their regional headquarters and the number of
such headquarters has been rising steadily in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The development of Hong Kong into a more business and financial
services oriented economy represents an integration of Hong Kong
into the region, which will further enhance Hong Kong's economic
potential.

<HEADLINE> End Of Successful IFLA Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The 62nd general conference of
the International Federation of Library Associations and
Institutions (IFLA) concluded here today after six days of
discussing things like the relationship between the information
revolution and human life.
</P>
<P>
"The 62nd general conference of the IFLA lays a foundation for
future international exchanges and co-operation in libraries,"
said Liu Zhongde, executive chairman of the conference's
organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
To Chinese libraries and librarians, the conference is an
unprecedented event, both in scale and in support given by the
Chinese government, noted Liu, who is also China's Minister of
Culture.
</P>
<P>
During the conference's opening ceremony, Premier Li Peng said
that the Chinese government places great importance on libraries.
</P>
<P>
Robert Wedgeworth, president of the IFLA, said that he wanted
to use the word "overwhelming" to summarize the conference, and
spoke highly of the work the organizing committee did, saying that
the academic activities and organizing work were quite successful.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 2,600 delegates from 94 countries and regions
participated in various activities around the theme, "Challenge of
Change: Library and Economic Development".
</P>
<P>
The delegates agreed that the library will play a new role as
an information center and an engine to push the development of
global economy.
</P>
<P>
Topics discussed mostly dealt with electronic technology and
its impact on information flow. "'Digital' and 'electronics' may
be the top two words which have been heavily used during this
conference, even more than the word 'library'," a Chinese delegate
told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
An electronic environment will be the major issue to be
discussed by the IFLA in its 1998-2001 plan, members at the
conference decided, and a statement on copyrights was approved by
the conference, saying that copyright protection should not hinder
information flow.
</P>
<P>
Delegates also discussed access to information and free
expression. Some of them pointed out that the information gap
between developing and developed countries is growing, and that
the developing countries have difficulties in obtaining
information freely.
</P>
<P>
They said that one single organization should not and can not
work out a unified rule to settle problems in information flow in
different countries.
</P>
<P>
Liu Kejing, a teacher at Central China Normal University, was
awarded the Gustav Hofmann Study Grant at the conference, to
support his research in the area of freedom of information and
intellectual property in western European countries.
</P>
<P>
Dong Ming, a Chinese self-employed owner of a library for
youngsters, was given a special award of encouragement at the
conference.
</P>
<P>
The 63rd IFLA conference will be held in Copenhagen, Denmark,
next year, with the theme "libraries and information for human
development".

</P>
<P>
"We were only investigating the sensitive nature of the
information," said a police spokesman. The two men were freed
after the police questioning.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said the two journalists might face severe
charges for "leaking military information."
</P>
<P>
"We only invited both men for questioning because we feel they
had compromised confidential matters by claiming that the army
communications in Freetown had intercepted a radio message on
Monday in which Sankoh gave specific orders to his war front
commandos to restart the war," the spokesman explained.
</P>
<P>
The paper had also quoted government sources for the claim.
According to military sources,alo Sankoh's intercepted radio message
coincided with a rebel ambush along the Bo-Kenema Highway which
claimed three lives.

</P>
<P>
He said the government and Moro National Liberation Front
(MNLF) peace panels concluded early this morning the final round
of talks as scheduled and initialed the final agreement in the
presence of Indonesian President Soeharto in Jakarta.
</P>

"I commended the two panels and their respective members for
their selfless efforts and steadfastness in seeking for the
agreement on the many difficult issues that have evaded consensus
for the last four years," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president said these issues involved the establishment of

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said
that China's information and communication industry will see a
greater growth in the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
The country is willing to strengthen its cooperation in this
field with all other countries.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remark in Beijing this afternoon during a meeting
with Kang Bong-gyun, the Republic of Korea's (ROK) minister of
Information and Communication.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the current age is an information era, and
information plays a major role in social and economic development.
</P>
<P>
As China's economy develops, and its people's living conditions
improve, China will see a bigger demand in its information
markets, Li added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the ROK has made useful explorations, and gained
much experience in information industry and communication
technology, while China has made much progress in its information
and communication industry over recent years, especially during
the Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-95).
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he added, the prospects for further cooperation
between the two countries are promising.
</P>
<P>
Kang said that his ministry has enjoyed a sound cooperation
with the Chinese Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. ROK

<HEADLINE> Syrian FM to Visit France Next Month (II) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara had informed
U.S. Senator Arlen Specter, who visited Damascus Wednesday and
held a meeting with Syrian President Hafez Assad, that Syria is
prepared for the resumption of peace negotiations on the basis of
the Madrid conference and the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
He also told him that Syria is not prepared to embark on
negotiations at the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
terms which, Damascus believes, will dynamite all previous peace
efforts and principles.
</P>
<P>
The intensive diplomatic efforts to rescue the peace process
are taking place in the midst of tensions prompted by the Israeli
government moves to expand settlements in the occupied
territories, and the freezing of talks on the Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
Political observers anticipate an active and more effective
French role in future, particularly due to the lack of an
effective American role during the current U.S. election
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
France, a member of the supervision committee monitoring the
the April 26 understanding between Israel and Hezbollah
guerrillas, also enjoys the support of the Arab parties in the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the newspaper Baath, the organ of the ruling party
in Syria, has underlined today in an editorial that France's
historic relations with the Arab states and its prominent role in
the European Union, entitle it (France) to play a leading role in
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Syria, the newspaper said, appreciates France's
"firm, clear and brave" stance toward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The editorial added that the French role will encourage the
U.S. and Russia to undertake their roles and commitments to
achieving a just and comprehensive peace. Meanwhile, it will
compel the Israeli government to reassess its calculations and
to refrain from taking any adventurous decisions.

<HEADLINE> HK Disappointed with US Measures on Garments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government
expressed its disappointment with the announcement of the U.S.
Customs on four categories of HK garments, which will be put on a
"watch list" from September 1 for allegedly illegal transshipment
concerns.
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman said, "We have a 30-day program starting
 on September 2 for joint visits to Hong Kong factories by Hong
Kong and U.S. Customs officers in respect of the 10 categories of
Hong Kong garments on which the U.S. Customs have imposed
additional import measures."
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong expects the U.S. Customs to have the
conclusion at the end of the program that there is no need for any
additional import measures on the four categories.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.S. announcement published Thursday, the U.S.
Customs will put four categories of Hong Kong garments on a "watch
list" with effect from September 1, and monitor them for 30 days
to determine whether illegal transshipment might be occurring.
</P>
<P>
The four categories are cotton gloves, cotton knit shirts,
women's cotton pants and cotton dressing gown.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said, "We have invited them to share with us
their data leading to their concerns, so that the two sides could
corroborate their respective information on these categories.
</P>
<P>
"We have further said that while such exchanges were in
process, the U.S. should not take action such as putting the
products on a 'watch list,'" he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are in fact discussing with the U.S. Customs arrangements
for such exchange of data. We are disappointed that in the
meantime, the U.S. Customs have decided on this 'watch list'
action," he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the Government would continue to
discuss with the U.S. Customs arrangements for the two sides to
exchange information and data on the four categories as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong government earlier announced that at an
invitation by the Customs and Excise Department, eight U.S.
Customs officers will come to Hong Kong for a 30-day program to
observe the territory's textiles export control systems in respect
of the 10 categories on which the U.S. Customs has applied
additional import measures since June 17.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Hong Kong's exports to the U.S. of the four
categories to be put on the U.S. Customs' "watch list" were 6.7
billion HK dollars (864.5 million US dollars), or 18 percent of
Hong Kong's total textiles and clothing exports to the United
States.

<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Supporters of traditional
Chinese medicine on the mainland and in Hong Kong should make
joint efforts to promote the traditional cause, a scholar from
Hong Kong said today.
</P>
<P>
Concluding a visit to Beijing, Daniel C. W. Tse, chairman of
the Preparatory Committee for the Promotion of Traditional Chinese
Medicine of Hong Kong, said traditional Chinese medicine has been
neglected in Hong Kong for more than 100 years. Since the

added. The Basic Law defines the direction for the development of
traditional Chinese medicine in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong government is paying increasing attention to this
cause.
</P>
<P>
The Preparatory Committee for the Promotion of Traditional
Chinese Medicine was established in April of last year. Daniel
Tse, president of Hong Kong Baptist University, was appointed
chairman of the committee.
</P>
<P>
Tse said the Hong Kong side has attached much importance to his
Beijing tour, and some senior government officials from relevant
departments of Hong Kong were included in the delegation.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing his delegation exchanged broad with mainland
counterparts, who offered precious opinions on how to promote
traditional Chinese medicine in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
They also visited Beijing Medical Sciences University and
reached agreements with the university on assistance.
</P>
<P>
Tse said the mainland has accumulated abundant experience on
traditional Chinese medicine, much of which can be used for
reference in Hong Kong.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Threat of possible withdrawal
from the Commonwealth by members of the west African sub-region
and Britain's insistence that sanction will only harm ordinary
people may have influenced the decision to put on hold further
sanctions against Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
A member of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG)
and Ghana's Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammed Ibrahim Shamars said
Thursday, quoted by the Guardian newspaper today, ''we made the
position known at the meeting of a possible pull-out because we
believe there is no need for further sanctions against Nigeria."
</P>
<P>
The eight-member CMAG, including New Zealand, Malaysia,
Zimbabwe, Jamaica, Ghana, Britain, South Africa and Canada, met
in London on Wednesday to discuss how to deal with the proposal
talks with Nigeria scheduled for Thursday and Friday. The talks
has been put off because of disagreement on the activities of the
CMAG team to Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
''Whatever happens to Nigeria in terms of imposition of more
sanctions will affect the people of the sub-region. I believe
that what should be the focus between Nigeria and the
Commonwealth now is continued dialog to resolve the crisis. And
we support the step,'' said Shamars.
</P>
<P>
However, he restated the Commonwealth stand on the release of
political detainees, adding: ''government should release chief
Abiola, General Olusgun Obasanjo, Gani Fawehinmi and other
political detainees for a conducive atmosphere towards the
democratic rule."
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated the Ghanaian government's belief in
Nigeria's transition program to civil rule, saying the military
will hand over the power to a democratically-elected government
in 1998 as promised.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria was suspended from the Commonwealth last November
following the execution of author Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other

CHENGDU, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Distance, a three year old
orphan Giant Panda, is the latest of 40 of the endangered cuddly
animals to be rescued by workers at a Chinese nature reserve.
</P>
<P>
Now the humans who 'adopted' orphan Distance, are looking
ahead to the days when he will be old enough to have a 'bride'.
</P>
<P>
One worker at the Fengtongzhai Nature Reserve in Baoxing
County, in Southwest China's Sichuan Province, say they will help
him find a suitable mate.
</P>
<P>
Distance has lived in the nature reserve since he was born, and
is healthy, enjoying a a comfortable life with the help of human
nurses.
</P>
<P>
In the reserve, Distance has sufficient nutritious food,
including eggs, milk, cod-liver oil and glucose, as well as his
main course of fresh bamboo, they said.
</P>
<P>
There have been more than 40 sick giant pandas like Distance,
who have received special treatment from the local workers before
being returned to the nature since 1983.
</P>
<P>
Located between the Sichuan Basin and the Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau, Baoxing is a mountainous county covered by large areas of
forest. It also boasts abundant water and bamboo trees. It has
become an ideal home for giant pandas.
</P>
<P>
"Sufficient food and a comfortable climate make the county a
paradise for the precious animal," scientists said.
</P>
<P>
Within a 1,100-sq-km area in the county, 30 percent of it
covered by bamboo trees, there are over 300 giant pandas,
accounting for one third of the country's total, according to a
survey conducted jointly by the Chinese, United States and
Canadian scientists in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Giant pandas in Baoxing county, which is next to the well-known
Wolong national nature reserve, are of a quite different species,
with a full figure, slightly short tail and round mouth, and are
considered "most lovely", scientists said.
</P>
<P>
The majority of giant pandas in the county inhabit Fengtongzhai
reserve, covering an area of some 60 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Every year, it receives regular subsidiaries from the local
governments and large amounts in donations from domestic and
overseas organizations and individuals, to pay for protecting and
taking care of giant pandas.
</P>
<P>
To maintain a peaceful and healthy life for the giant pandas,
many local residents have moved out of the reserve since its
founding in 1979, and regulations against hunting and tree-cutting
have been enforced in the area.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Reduces Trade Deficit with U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Egypt reduced its trade deficit
with the United States by about 22 million U.S. dollars in the
first four months of this year thanks to a remarkable increase in
exports.
</P>
<P>
According to a report issued by the Egyptian-American Chamber
of Commerce, the trade deficit was 717.5 million dollars from
January to April in 1996 as compared to 739.4 million dollars
during the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The report, carried by the lastest issue of Egypt's economic
weekly Middle East News, said that Egypt's exports to the
U.S. reached 245.8 million dollars in the four months, rising by
16.2 percent over 211.5 million dollars for the same period of
1995.
</P>
<P>
The volume of non-petroleum exports increased by 3.5 percent,
from 143.4 million dollars to 148.5 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The exports of textiles and ready-made clothes also rose by a
big margin, hitting 99.4 million dollars, while the exports of
foodstuffs and raw materials reached 26.9 million dollars compared
to 19.9 million last year.
</P>
<P>
The report predicted that Egypt's total exports to the U.S. in
1996 would reach 800 million dollars, including 300 million in oil
exports and 500 million in non-oil exports.
</P>
<P>
During the first four months of this year, the report said,
Egypt's imports from the U.S. increased by only 1.3 percent over
the same period of 1995, from 950.9 million to 963.3 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The increase was mainly due to a rise in world prices of wheat
and corn, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Egypt imported from the U.S. 277.1 million dollars worth of
wheat from January to April this year. The volume recorded an
increase of 42 percent over that for the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Egypt's imports of corn flour reached 123.4 million
dollars, increasing by 31.5 percent over 93.8 million dollars
during the first four months of last year.

Constitutional Commission of Papua New Guinea, Ben Micah.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting in Beijing, both agreed to strengthen
economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Noting that he is glad to meet Ben Micah again, Qian recalled
his successful visit to Papua New Guinea not long ago, saying it
played a positive role in enhancing mutual understanding and
promoting the development of relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that Papua New Guinea is rich in resources and has
great potential for development.
</P>
<P>
Although China and Papua New Guinea are far away from each
other, the two sides can conduct cooperation on the basis of
equality and reciprocity, under joint efforts, said Qian.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese business community is willing to cooperate with the
Papua New Guinean side in exploring resources, added Qian.
</P>
<P>
Ben Micah said that since Papua New Guinea and China set up
diplomatic relations in 1976, relations have been developing well.
</P>
<P>
He said his country hopes to increase its exchanges and
cooperation with China in various fields like politics, economy,
trade and culture.

<P>
DAMASCUS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Shara will pay an official visit to France on September 2-3 at
the invitation of his French counterpart Harve De Charette.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources here consider the visit as part of the drive
to unleash the peace process and to resume peace negotiations on
all tracks, particularly on the Syrian-Israeli and
Palestinian-Israeli tracks.
</P>
<P>
The sources pointed out that the French foreign minister will
inform his Syrian counterpart about the outcome of the recent
meetings in France between Osama al Baz, adviser of Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's adviser Dore Gold, and Deniss Ross, an American
coordinator of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
This meeting was aimed at overcoming the obstacles encountering
the peace process and seeking a common formula to rescue the
process and to alleviate tension in Syrian-Israeli relations which
had developed into an exchange of threats and a demonstration of
military might, exposing the regional peace process to the dangers
of collapse.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts in the Syrian capital Damascus indicate that
the intensive diplomatic drives undertaken by Egypt and the
U.S. to contain the situation in the region and to rescue the
peace process, as well as the extensive French engagement in these
drives, have introduced new dimensions to Middle East situation.
</P>
<P>
These moves have aroused hopes in salvaging the peace process,
alleviating tension, and in guarding against the outbreak of
military adventures that may dynamite the roots of the peace
process.

KUNMING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan
Province has built a 179-kilometer highway using 150 million US
dollars of a loan extended by the Asian Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
The bank has extended a 280 million US dollar loan to the

<HEADLINE> S.Africa Not to Introduce Compulsory Service for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government had no immediate plans to introduce compulsory service
for doctors in areas suffering a shortage of physicians, the
local daily ''the Citizen'' reported today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Pretoria, Tim Wilson, chief Director
of Academic Health Services and Hospital Development of the
Department of Health, said there might be no need to implement
such a service if the proposed scheme of doctors having to
undergo another two years of vocational training works well.
</P>
<P>
''At the moment we have no plans to activate the motion of
compulsory community service,'' said Wilson.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, the idea of South Africa's newly
qualified doctors performing duty in the public health services
as an alternative to military service dated back to 1989.
</P>
<P>
A resolution adopted last month by the Interim National
Medical and Dental Council (INMDC) demanded that all interns
receive two additional years of vocational training before being
allowed to go into independent private practice.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, widely criticized as being compulsory
community service in disguise, was strongly opposed by medical
students and those doctors possibly affected by the motion.
</P>
<P>
However, Wilson said the department supported the INMDC
proposal, and was committed to putting it into practice once the
council had finalised its requirements.
</P>
<P>
''If we equip our doctors properly, they are more likely to go
to under-serviced areas on their own, especially if we improve
their benefits and working conditions,'' added Wilson. enditem

</P>
<P>
The fair is aimed at promoting publication exchanges, and
developing China's book co-operation with the world, he said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Giant Panda as Goodwill Diplomat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, August 30 (Xinhua) -- China has presented a total 23
giant pandas as goodwill diplomats to nine countries around the
world since the founding of New China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
A report from Baoxing county, Southwest China's Sichuan
Province, known as the "panda's paradise", shows that the county
has sent 115 living giant pandas to the central government in the
past 47 years.
</P>
<P>
Among the 23 giant pandas the Chinese government presented to
foreign countries, 16 were from Baoxing county.
</P>
<P>
The first panda "ambassador", named Pingping, sent to the
former Soviet Union in 1955, originated in Baoxing.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion of US President Richard Nixon's trip to China
in 1972, the Chinese government offered two other Baoxing giant
pandas to the American people.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that more than 1.1 million people paid a visit
to the two pandas, "Lingling" and "Xingxing", in a national zoo in
Washington D.C. in a single month, and the year was named the "year
of panda."
</P>
<P>
Twenty years after that, the zoo published a special issue on
panda craze, commemorating the 20th anniversary of the visit to
the country by the two pandas.
</P>
<P>
Among the visiting pandas from Baoxing, "Baobao" was accorded
the most prestigious reception. The panda's luxury apartment in
Berlin zoo cost 750,000 Deutsche Marks to build. It consumes fresh
and tender bamboo worth 40,000 Deutsche Marks every year, in
addition to other food including specially prepared delicious
soup, chicken meat and fruit.
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the brilliant performances given by a giant panda
"superstar" from Baoxing in Chicago, such as saluting, bicycle
riding and basketball shooting, won enthusiastic applause and was
reported in scores of countries around the world. The panda
received a special acrobatic training in acrobatics.

ADDIS ABABA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's coffee export
will rise marginally to 108,000 tons in l996-97 from 102,000 tons
in 1995/96.
</P>
<P>
According to a report here today, the forecast was made by
Tsegaye Berhane, General Manager of Ethiopian Coffee and Tea
Authority.
</P>
<P>
He said: ''Ethiopia shall strive to export up to 108,000 tons
of its arabica coffee, famed for its aroma and flavour, in the
1996/97 year.''
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia exported 102,000 tons of coffee in 1995/96, the
highest exported volume in its trade history. But it earned only
279.5 million US dollars, lower than the 300.9 million US Dollars
it received for exporting 78,420 tons of coffee in 1994/95.
</P>
<P>
''We must strive not only to increase the volume of our coffee
exports but it is most essential that the commodity should be of
the highest quality to compete among the best in the world,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia is Africa's third largest coffee producer after
Uganda and Cote d'Ivoire. enditem

<HEADLINE> Closure Prevents High Turnout for Friday Prayers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Some 8,000 Palestinian Moslem
worshipers, a quarter of the regular turnout, arrived today for
Friday prayers at the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, as a result of
a strict Israeli closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Many Palestinians were turned back this morning by Israeli
army and police at the checkpoints at the entrance to Jerusalem,
and were unable to participate in Moslem Friday prayers in the
holy city.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, police sources told Israel Radio that the low
attendance may be because the Palestinians have sought to avoid
confrontations with the police at the roadblocks in the city.
</P>
<P>
Some 100,000 Palestinians were originally expected to heed
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat's
call to participate in today's massive Friday prayers, in
protest against Israeli government's policies.
</P>
<P>
This is the second protest called by Arafat following
Thursday's four-hour general strike, the first time in two years,
observed by Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some 2,000 Israeli police and security forces have
been deployed in Jerusalem today in precaution against any
anti-Israeli violence by Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, it was decided at today's cabinet
meeting of the Israeli government that Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu will head up a ministerial committee that will conduct
negotiations with Palestinians on the Hebron redeployment.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to ease mounting tensions, Israel and the Palestinians
Thursday also agreed to convene the steering committee next week,
the first time since the new Israeli government assumed power in
June, for further implementation of the Oslo accords.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Mine to Produce Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 30 (xinhua) -- Bulyankulu Mine at
Shinyanga Region in Northwestern Tanzania will start producing
gold in 1999 with a target output of 200,000 ounces per year.
</P>
<P>
The production, valued at 45 million U.S. Dollars each year,
is to replace unrecorded gold finds by small scale miners who
scavenge the area with picks, shovels and hoes, according to a
local newspaper today.
</P>
<P>
President and Chief Executive Officer of Sutton Resources
Michaael Kenyon told a meeting in Vancouver of Canada recently
that operating costs for Bulyankulu are estimated to be in the
lowest quartile of gold producers.
</P>
<P>
According to Kenyon, exploration and underground development
of the 14-million-U.S.-Dollar program will start soon.
</P>
<P>
"Sutton's objective is to complete a full bankable feasibility
study before the end of 1997. We are fully funded through
feasibility. We are working toward production in 1999, with a
target production of about 200,000 ounces of gold per year, and
operating costs we estimate will be in the lowest quartile of
gold producers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last December Sutton Resources announced gold reserves at
Bulyankulu of 3.5 million ounces.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive officer said, "Bulyankulu already
qualifies as a world-class gold deposit since over 100 tons of
contained gold have been outlined so far." He said, "The reef
deposit is open in all directions and the project area has
several promising target areas still to be tested."
</P>
<P>
"We are planning to add resources by aggressive exploration
and the potential for the discovery of a lot more gold at
Bulyankulu is superb," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sutton Resource, a Canadian Company, is one of the foreign
companies now actively involved in the exploration of gold in the
country. Other companies involved include Pangea Minerals Ltd.,
East African Gold Mines Ltd., Romanex, Mobrama Company Ltd. and
RTZ.

Johannesburg, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The German luxury car-maker BMW
is to double the apacity of its South African plant by 1999
with an investment of 220 million U.S.dollars, company chairman Bernd
Pischetsrieder said.
</P>
<P>
The investment over four years at the Rosslyn plant near Pretoria
is aimed primarily at the export market in right-hand drive vehicles
made by the Munich-based company, Pischetsrieder was quoted as saying
by a local daily, "The Citizen".
</P>
<P>
BMW was confident that enough progress has been made to convince
that its South African subsidiary would be capable of matching German
quality and delivery standards, he said.
</P>
<P>
In a warning to organised labour, the chairman said contingency
measures would remain in place in Germany to enable BMW to make good
any lost prodution in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"We are hearing a lot of militant rhetoric from South Afrian labour
leaders," he said, adding "what we would like to hearing now are some
assurances and guarantees that our export program will be supported
by the labour".
</P>
<P>
He repeated his warning that the company would be forced to review
its South African investment if crime continued to escalate.
</P>
<P>
The chairman made his first warning from Germany in January when
the planned expansion was first unveiled.
</P>
<P>
Attaks on German company executives in South Africa, some fatal,
have received extensive coverage in Germany. enditem

CAIRO, August 30 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to foil a conference of
fundamentalists to be held on September 9 in London, the Egyptian
security agencies have sent the files of fugitive terrorists to

</P>
<P>
The terrorists who are currently living in London have been

The files included information on two terrorists identified as

being involved in an assassination attempt on Egypt's former Prime
Minister Atef Sedki. Maguid is a member of the Moslem
fundamentalist group Jihad Movement.

Egypt, which has been haunted by a violent anti-government
campaign launched by Moslem fundamentalist militants four years
ago in an attempt to install strict Islamic rule in the country,
has expressed great concern over the conference under the name of
"The International Islamic Conference Rally for Revival."
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and other Egyptian officials
have complained repeatedly that European countries and the United
States have provided safe havens to extremists opposed to
governments in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
The files which Egypt has sent to the British government said
that the outlawed Moslem Brotherhood, Egypt's largest Moslem
fundamentalist group, managed to get funds for holding conferences
and issuing publications through its information center in
London.
</P>
<P>
Algeria, which has also been plagued by terrorist attacks in
the past few years, has called on Britain to make clarifications
on the Islamic conference to be attended by fundamentalists
throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
An Algerian Foreign Ministry spokesman was quoted by Egyptian
newspapers as saying that Algeria rejects the conference because
the terrorist leaderships and loyalists of the international
terrorism and its financiers will attend.
</P>
<P>
In Egypt's Mediterranean port city of Alexandria, Mubarak said
Wednesday that the conference does not serve the cause of
international terrorism combating.
</P>
<P>
Arab political circles have criticized the British government
for allowing such gatherings under the pretext of democracy and
human rights, according to earlier reports.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Former world heavyweight boxing
champion Frank Bruno has hanged up boxing gloves, according to
local reports.
</P>
<P>
The 35-year-old decided to quit after being told by top medical
Professor Davis McLeod that a single blow could leave him blind in
one eye.
</P>
<P>
His decision comes five months after he lost his World Boxing
Council crown to Mike Tyson in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
In all he had 45 fights, winning 40 of them and scored a total
of 38 knockouts.
</P>
<P>
He lost three world title fights before finally landing the
crown by beating Oliver McCall in a unanimous points decision at
Wembley in September 1995.
</P>
<P>
Bruno was only the third Briton ever to hold a world
heavyweight title but his reign as world champion only lasted
until March of this year, when he lost to Tyson in his first
defence.

<HEADLINE> Five Mideast Countries link Electricity Grids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Five countries in the Middle East
are working to build an inter-state electricity supply network in
an attempt to meet growing demand and cut costs.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Ministry of Electricity has signed agreements with
Jordan, Iraq, Turkey and Syria on the ambitious plan called "Five
Countries Interconnection Project (FCIP), according to Al Ahram
Weekly published lately.
</P>
<P>
Once completed by the year 2002, the extended power grid will
link Egypt with Asia through Syria and Jordan, and to Europe
through Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Joining power grids will allow the involved countries to rely
on the others' power supply during local peak hours when demand
often exceeds supply, Engineer Maher Aziz, director of Egypt's
Environmental Studies Department in the Electricity and Energy
Authority, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The five countries could expect to save up to 2 billion
U.S. dollars per year by utilizing Jordan and Turkey's excess
power generating capabilities, experts said.
</P>
<P>
A 500 kilo volt transmission line is being laid acrossing
Sinai from Suez to Taba, which will be connected in Aqaba to the
400 kilo volt Jordanian system, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, Syria, Iraq and Turkey will all be interconnected
through 400 kilo volt transmission lines, being financed by the
Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development and the European
Investment Bank, the weekly paper reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an Egypt-Libya electricity link has reached its
final stages, with a 220 kilo volt power line between El-Salloum
on the Egyptian border and Tubruq in Libya being laid down.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, another 220 kilo volt line between
Libya and Tunisia is already connected to Algeria and
Morocco. Once the 400 kilo volt undersea cable is completed and
installed between Morocco and Spain, the nations of North Africa
will be connected to Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
A plan for a pan-Arab interconnection is also in the making,
the paper said, with the aim of extending the joint network to
Saudi Arabia and other gulf countries.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that Egypt's demand for electricity
over the last decade has increased tremendously, from 3,250 mw/h
in 1981 to 8,500 mw/h in 1995. By the year 2015, this figure is
expected to reach 20,000 kw/h.
</P>
<P>
Egypt will be able to depend on the other countries connected
to the grid during its peak hour demand while being able to store
its supply of electricity during the other countries' peak hours,
at lower cost, the Egyptian authorities anticipated.

<HEADLINE> US Softens Stand on Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States may have
softened its tough stand against Nigeria, following a recent
visit to this west African country by a special envoy.
</P>
<P>
The United States has also begun exploring the possibility of
diplomatic discussions on human rights and democracy with
Nigeria, and the visit of Congressman Bill Richardson was for
this purpose, according to press reports today.
</P>
<P>
The trip is an effort ''to help us determine whether the
Nigerians may be serious as they profess they are about a retrun
to democracy,'' the reports quoted US State Department Spokesman
Blyn Davies as saying.
</P>
<P>
Richard visited Nigeria last week and returned to the United
States over the weekend. He met with a number of high-ranking
Nigerian officials and had a two-hour meeting with head of state
General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
His trip is belived to come after the Nigerian government made
certain commitments about a return to democracy in recent talks
with officials of the United Nations and the Commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
The United States has also congratulated General Abacha on his
election as Chairman of the Economic Community of West African
States.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries have deteriorated since
the annulment of the presidential election in 1993 when Chief
Moshood Abiola, who is now still in detention, declared himself
president.
</P>
<P>
In addition to earlier sanctions, the United States suspended
aid and arm sales and restricted visas to officials of the
Nigerian government last year following the execution of play
writer Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni activists for murder.
</P>
<P>
In March this year, the United States proposed stronger
sanctions, including a ban on new investments and the freezing of
the assets of top Nigerian officials, but it was unable to rally
enough international support for the measure.  enditem

<HEADLINE> Zambian Press Welcomes Chiluba's Inititative to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- ''The Post'', a major newspaer
in zambia, carried a signed article today to welcome President
Frederick Chiluba's initiative to talk with the oppositon, saying
''that is the Zambian way of resolving conflict, not through
violence''.
</P>
<P>
President Chiluba announced on August 25 that he will meet
Kenneth Kaunda, leader of the opposition United National
Independence Party and former State President, to ease political
tension in the country. The latter gave him a positive response
on Thursday, saying he is ready to meet Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
''The meeting was beautifully relaxed and we were all in
support of his (Chiluba) decision,'' the article quoted Nakatindi
Wina, Chairperson of the Women's Affairs of the ruling Movement
for Multi-Party Democrcy, as saying.
</P>
<P>
On Chiluba's one-on-one stand to have talks with leaders of
the opposition parties, the article quoted public opinion as
saying that the strategy would minimize a break down in
communications.
</P>
<P>
''This will help avoid the problems they faced at the last
inter-party talks at which there was a lot of insults,
disrespect and pure noise,'' the article said.
</P>
<P>
The article expressed the hope that President Chiluba and
other political leaders in the country should not spoil the
dialog with pride and arrogance or unreasonable conditions.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Export Growth Far Below Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's export growth during
the first seven months this year was only 3.8 percent over the
same period last year, falling far short of the lowered 10.2
percent target, according to the Bank of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
During the said period, imports grew 8.2 percent, against the
year's revised target of 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, year-on-year export growth during the first eight
months last year was 24.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The decline in export growth led to fears of a baht devaluation
and a net capital outflow of 2.2 billion baht (88 million US
dollars) in July, causing a balance of payments deficit of 17.1
billion baht (684 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Foreign reserves in July stood at 39.4 billion dollars,
equivalent to 6.5 months' imports, down from 39.8 billion dollars
in July.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's Research Department expected an increase in
exports during the rest of the year because seasonal factors would
help agricultural product shipments.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts believe that the country relies too heavily
on short-term speculative capital inflows and that the government
should shore up exports and boost foreign investors' confidence.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Sakigake Party Chief Switched After Inner Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The president of New Party
Sakigake, the smallest partner in Japan's tripartite ruling
coalition, was replaced and a key member deserted today after
weeks of intra-party wrangling over the formation of a new party.
</P>
<P>
Shoichi Ide, 57, a former health minister, took over from
Sakigake chief Masayoshi Takemura, a former finance minister, who
resigned after a revolt by young party members, party officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Ide's inauguration, Yukio Hatoyama, who had led
the revolt and resigned as Sakigake's Secretary General earlier
this week, submitted a note of secession to Ide and said he would
form a new party in mid-September.
</P>
<P>
Hatoyama had decided to withdrew from Sakigake after two days
of talks with Takemura, who hoped to change Sakigake as a whole
into a new party. Hatoyama rejected Takemura's proposal and asked
him to "refrain" from joining the new party.
</P>
<P>
The 49-year-old maverick is expected to announce a policy line
for his new party around September 10 before launching it. The
splinter party is likely to lure over several incumbent Sakigake
lawmakers, less than five legislators from the Social Democratic
Party (SDP), and Hatoyama's younger brother Kunio of the leading
opposition party Shinshinto (New Frontier Party).
</P>
<P>
Ide, a founding member of Sakigake, was in charge of the health
ministry in 1994 under ex-Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama.
</P>
<P>
The vacancy left by Hatoyama will be filled by Hiroyuki Sonoda,
one of two party vice presidents.
</P>
<P>
Sakigake is a member of the three-party ruling coalition with
the SDP and Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's Liberal Democratic
Party (LDP), the largest force in the coalition.

<HEADLINE> S.African Army, Air Force Join Anti-Crime Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The fight against rampant
crime has taken on a new dimension in Gauteng Province and
surrounding areas this week with the launch of ''operation
anvil'', a combined police, army and air force anti-crime drive,
the local daily ''the Citizen'' reported today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at Doornkop military base near Pretoria
on Thursday, operation leader Colonel Buks Pieterse said the
three-day operation, started on Tuesday, was a proactive curb on
crime throughout Gauteng by classical army tactics of mobility
and surprise to clamp down on criminals.
</P>
<P>
During the opeation, small police units backed up by the army
were being flown to crime hotspots throughout the province to set
up road-blocks and search operations.
</P>
<P>
Pieterse said the army force backing up the police in the
operation included about 800 regular troops plus commando units
from surrounding rural areas.
</P>
<P>
About 100 air force personnel from all over the country were
also involved in the operation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, National Police Commissioner George Fivaz told
reporters in Pretoria on thursday the police would adopt a
''gloves-off approach'' towards criminals and apply the maximum
lethal force allowed by law in fighting violent crime.
</P>
<P>
Fivaz said an extra 1000 police officers would be deployed in
Gauteng from today as an urgent step to clamp down on killer
hijackings and police murders.
</P>
<P>
''We are not going to allow any further murders on our police
officers and on innocent people,'' said Fivaz, adding the
anti-crime blitz would continue for months if necessary.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the special measures had been prompted by a recent
spate of hijackings and police murders in Gauteng.
</P>
<P>
South African police services officers, due to lack of
necessary equipment, have often become targets of criminals when
performing their duties.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, to ensure the success of the operation, Fivaz said
another 500 army officers and more air force helicopters would be
deployed to support the police during the anti-crime drive
throughout the province.
</P>
<P>
Private security firms, the business community and other
interested parties would also be involved in the operation, he
added. enditem

<HEADLINE> Egypt, U.S. to Hold Talks on Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian and U.S. officials will
hold talks here next month on ways to promote U.S. investments in
Egypt and boost trade exchange between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The talks will also cover Egypt's new economic reform program
recently approved in principle by the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and preparations for the Middle East and North Africa
Economic Summit to be held in Cairo on November 12-14.
</P>
<P>
The talks are part of efforts to implement the Mubarak-Gore
Initiative, an agreement signed between Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak and U.S. Vice President Al Gore last year to strengthen
bilateral economic, scientific and technological cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, a close ally of the United States in the Middle East, is
the second largest recipient of U.S. aid. It gets an annual grant
of some 2.1 billion U.S. dollars in economic and military
assistance.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been hoping that the U.S. will also contribute more
to the development of its economy in the form of investments.
</P>
<P>
The volume of U.S. investments in Egypt is now estimated at 1.4
billion dollars, including 1.11 billion in oil fields, the Cairo
press said today, citing diplomatic sources.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is Egypt's biggest trade partner. The volume of
bilateral trade exchange reached 3.6 billion dollars in 1995, but
the Egyptian exports to the U.S. were only 6.6 million dollars
worth.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest report issued by the Egyptian-American
Chamber of Commerce, however, there was a remarkable increase in
Egypt's exports to the United States.
</P>
<P>
In the first four months of this year, the exports reached
245.8 million dollars, rising by 16.2 percent from 211.5 million
dollars for the same period of last year, the report said.

Robert Stuart, an official from the IFLA executive board, said
that China has done a great job of organizing the conference. He
has been on the board for the past decade.
</P>
<P>
The one-week conference proceeded smoothly after two years of
preparations, and also because of the concerted efforts of all
departments involved, said Du Ke, secretary general of the China
Organizing Committee, who was speaking in Beijing today at a
meeting on the organizing work.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the smooth conference, the organizing committee held
a simulated registration before the opening of the event. Two
hundred volunteers have received professional training for a year.
</P>
<P>
Officials from Denmark, Netherlands and Thailand, the hosts of
the next three IFLA general conferences, noted that they were
impressed by the work the China Organizing Committee had
done. They sought advice from Chinese officials on
conference-related transportation, translation and volunteer
services.

<P>
LONDON, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading British newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Prison governors in Britain were warned Thursday night to be
prepared for protest demonstrations by angry inmates after two
High Court judges ruled that Michael Howard, the Home Secretary,
was correct in his decision to stop the early release of prisoners
last week.
</P>
<P>
-- Labor remains the overwhelming favorite to win the next
general election in Britain despite the recovery in Tory support,
according to the latest MORI poll for The Times.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Signs of a strong pick up in U.S. economic growth Thursday
recharged speculation about a future rise in interest rates,
sending U.S. and European stock and bond markets lower.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- Britain seemed set on a collision course with Brussels over
beef again Thursday after fresh research which shows that mad cow
disease will die out naturally within five years.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- The European Commission suggested Thursday that it might be
necessary to slaughter even more British cows, rather than fewer
as suggested by British farmers, in order to eliminate BSE, or the
mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- Bill Clinton's coronation at the Democratic national
convention was dramatically overshadowed by scandal Thursday night
when his top political consultant, Dick Morris, resigned amid
revelations of a year-long affair with a prostitute to whom he had
leaked White House secrets.

<HEADLINE> Israel Urged to Allow Free Entries to Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 30 (Xinhua) -- A senior PLO official urged
today Israel to allow free entries of Palestinians to Jerusalem
for Friday prayers amid reports on stepped up Israeli security
measures in and around the holy city.
</P>
<P>
Faisal Husseini, a PLO Executive Committee member responsible
for Palestinian policy in Jerusalem, said that violence can be
avoided if Palestinians are allowed into Jerusalem to pray.
</P>
<P>
"If the Israeli side takes care of things in a fair manner,
lets everyone come to pray quietly, refrains from using force and
arrests, all will go quietly," he told Israel radio.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Israeli troops today set up roadblocks around
Jerusalem and in the West Bank and turned away Palestinians
trying to reach Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa Mosque for protest prayers
called by Palestinian President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Arafat asked both Palestinian and Israeli Arab Moslems to come
to pray at the mosque to show their protest against the Israeli
government's policies on expanding Jewish settlements in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The call was seen as a test for Israeli claim that it ensures
freedom of worship in the disputed city sacred to Jews, Moslems
and Christians. Under Israel's six-month closure of the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, most Palestinians are barred from coming to
Jerusalem, including the Al-Aqsa Mosque, Islam's third holiest
shrine.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Israeli police and security forces were reportedly
deployed today throughout east Jerusalem in precaution against any
anti-Israeli violence by Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani said police
would use force if necessary to prevent disturbances.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- An opening of dialogue between the Islamist government and
Kurds is in sight in Turkey. Prime minister Necmettin Erbankan is
planning a negotiation with the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK),
whose leader Abdullah "Apo" Ocalan is also adopting a conciliatory
policy towards Ankara and has hinted the possibility of releasing
seven Turkish soldiers.
</P>
<P>
No one is waiting for a short-term solution to the "Kurdish
question," which involves 13 million Kurds out of a total
population of 60 million in Turkey. An immediate stop of clashes
is not expected either. However, this is the first time in 12
years that peace talks become possible after the "dirty war" in
southeast Anatolia has cost some 20,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
-- The states are disarmed by information network and free
expression. The Finnish police have arrested a 19-year-old
college student for having 3,000 pictures of child sex and
cannibalism in his PC data. Experts attending the World Congress
Against Sexual Exploitation of Children said that one million
pornographic pictures and 40 million pages of the Internet are on
child sex.
</P>
<P>
Werner Nowak, an advisor to the End to Child Prostitution in
Asian Tourism in Bangkok, said that the Internet has helped the
pornography market explode.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Some 15,000 French cattle farmers Thursday stopped on the
road 2,000 trucks transporting imported cows and beefs to protest
the losses inflicted on them by the "mad cow" crisis in Europe.
The unions of cattle farmers are calling for the suspension of
import of cows and beefs from countries which are not members of
the European Union.
</P>
<P>
President Jacques Chirac, who has expressed his support to the
cattle farmers, is to meet the delegates of cattle farmers today.
This is the first time for a head of state to officially receive
cattle farmers in 50 years in France.
</P>
<P>
-- Jerusalem will again become the epicenter of conflict
between Israelis and Palestinians today, with all the elements for
a scene of confrontation made available. Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat has called a mass pray at the esplanade of the
Mosque Aqsa in East Jerusalem to increase pressure on Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has given a green light to
the expansion of Jewish settlement in West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops, being on full alert, have been deployed on road
blocks between West Bank and Jerusalem to prevent the infiltration
of Palestinians to the city.

<HEADLINE> Aircraft Maintenance Company Receives ISO9002 Standard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- A Sino-German aircraft
maintenance company has become the first civil aviation business
in China to be granted an ISO9002 certificate, it was announced
during a certification ceremony held in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
The acquisition of this certificate indicates that the Aircraft
Maintenance and Engineering Corporation in Beijing has fulfiled
the requirements outlined by the International Standardization
Organization (AMECO) in the quality management of aircraft
maintenance. It also shows that the quality of China's civil
aviation maintenance has been recognized and accepted
internationally.
</P>
<P>
"We consider the certificate an important edge for competition,
not only in the international market, but also domestically," said
Zhang Hongying, a deputy general manager of AMECO.
</P>
<P>
A 1989 joint venture between Air China and Lufthansa, AMECO is
the largest aircraft maintenance firm in China, as well as the
only of its kind in the country that has received certification of
its airworthiness from authorities in China, the US, and Europe.
</P>
<P>
"We have already added the requirements of ISO9002 into our
company's maintenance management manual, in order to remind all of
our employees to abide by it in their work," Zhang said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Police on High Alert for Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Israeli police
and security forces are put on the high alert today in Jerusalem in
precaution against possible anti-Israeli violence.
</P>
<P>
The move came following a call by Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat for mass prayers at the Al-Aqsa Mosque to protest Israel's
settlement expansion policy.
</P>
<P>
"We are taking (Arafat's call) seriously," Israeli Internal
Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani was quoted by today's Jerusalem
Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's call was seen as a test to Israel's claim that it
ensures freedom of worship in the disputed city. Under Israel's
six-month closure of the West Bank and Gaza, most Palestinians
have been barred from entering Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the call, about 100,000 palestinians are expected
to gather at the Al-Aqsa Mosque for prayers in a show of
solidarity with the Palestinian leadership in encountering Israel's
hardline policy.
</P>
<P>
Friday afternoon prayers are traditionally the most crowded at
the Al-Aqsa Mosque, and the size of today's crowd is largely
dependent on whether a closure is imposed, according to Israeli
security sources.
</P>
<P>
"We will not allow inciters onto the Temple Mount (where
Al-Aqsa stands)," Kahalani said, "if we have to we will using
force, but I hope we will not have to."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Police Inspector-General Assaf Hefetz said
that police would not allow protest marches by Palestinians in
East Jerusalem today, which, in his words, "may lead to
disturbances.".
</P>
<P>
"We will give maximum freedom to worshipers without risking
the possibility of rioting, and we hope that police will not be
forced to enter the Temple Mount, which we would interpret as an
extreme step," the police chief said.
</P>
<P>
Those who have no authorization to enter Jerusalem will not be
allowed to enter, Hefetz said, and roadblocks will be manned by
both police and the Israeli army.
</P>
<P>
He added that the security forces have been gathering
intelligence information to prevent any potential disturbances or
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani held a special meeting with Hefetz and other police
brass Thursday to discuss stringent security arrangements, in the
wake of Arafat's call.
</P>
<P>
The minister reportedly said that water cannons and mounted
police would be used only "if there is no choice".
</P>
<P>
Arafat asked both Palestinian and Israeli Arab Muslims to come
to pray at the Al-Aqsa Mosque after the Israeli government decided
to carry out its plan to expand Jewish settlements in the occupied
land.

HAIKOU, August 30 (Xinhua) -- A state-funded agriculture
education program that stressed planting and cultivation skills
has helped about 100,000 farmers in south China's Hainan Province
escape poverty in the past year.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the province had more than 600,000 poor farmers who
lived in Tongshi, Baoting, Lingshui, Qiongzhong and other
mountainous counties.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the provincial government spent nearly 50 million
yuan to help farmers open orchards, grow mango, litchi, longan and
coconut, and plant 500 hectares of industrial crops.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, assistance was provided to farmers to build 250 ha
of cultivation bases for the raising of kelp, crab, and fish.
</P>
<P>
Loans valued at over 30 million yuan were granted to set up 25
agricultural and aquatic products processing factories in the area.
</P>
<P>
Last year, farmers in these poor mountainous regions generated
a per capita income of 690 yuan, up 80 yuan over 1994.

<HEADLINE> ICA Chairman Says ICA Congress to Be Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Jean-Pierre Wallot, chairman of
the International Council on Archives (ICA), has expressed his
complete confidence in the success of the 13th ICA congress,
scheduled to open here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The congress will have a positive and profound impact on
development of the world's archival circles at the turn of two
centuries, the chairman told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"I have a high opinion of China's archival work and the Chinese
government's full support to the congress," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Wallot said the ICA chose Beijing as the host site for the
congress because of China's great achievements in the development
of its economy and society. It also has protected its archives in
the past years, and is playing an important role in global
archival circles, he added.
</P>
<P>
Wallot, who has visited China for four times, said that during
each visit, he saw new archival buildings under construction
throughout the country. Many historical documents, such as
70-year-old papers bearing Chairman Mao Zedong's handwriting, have
been well-protected.
</P>
<P>
All of these factors emphasize the Chinese government's great
attention to archival work and outstanding efforts of nearly one
million Chinese archivists, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The congress is to be the last grand gathering of top world
archivists this century, and the first ever to be held in a
developing country since the founding of the ICA in 1950.
</P>
<P>
During the six-day event, a series of academic activities will
be held around the theme of the congress, "Archives at the End of
the Century - Reviewing the Situation and Looking into the Future."
</P>
<P>
Some 2,600 archivists from more than 130 countries and regions
will discuss achievements which have been made in archive
protection, and will search for solutions to current problems that
challenge development, Wallot said.
</P>
<P>
Delegates will also discuss the history and future of archival
work in various countries, global trends in legislation on
archives, the development strategy of international archival
circles and other important issues.
</P>
<P>
Wallot, who was elected to be the ICA chairman in 1992, said
the ICA has promoted standardization and modernization of
international archive management in the past four years.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a great number of guidebooks, pamphlets, books,
audio-video and electronic publications in this field have been
published.
</P>
<P>
In 1980, China joined the International Council on Archives,
which now has more than 1,500 members from over 150 countries and
regions.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, China obtained the right to host the congress. It set
forth and put into operation the Archives Law of the People's
Republic of China that year.
</P>
<P>
Currently, China boasts more than 70 kinds of professional
publications and 3,574 archives at various levels containing 176
million volumes.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Cuts Interest Rates After Record Low Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's State Bank will reduce
the interest rates by 0.1 percent per month as of September 1, the
third time to cut the rates this year, according to local press
reports.
</P>
<P>
The short-term ceiling rate will be 1.5 percent per month and
the long- and medium-term ceiling rate will be 1.55 percent for
all loans in the Vietnamese currency dong, while the ceiling rate
for foreign currency loans will remain at 9.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
But people's credit funds will have the highest rate of up to
2.1 percent per month and in rural areas the maximum rate on loans
will be 1.7 percent, down from 1.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The reduction followed an eight-month fall in the consumer
price index and a record low inflation of 2.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Interest rates on loans have fallen drastically in Vietnam
since the beginning of this year. In January, rates on short- and
long-term loans were cut from 2.0 percent to 1.75 percent and 1.7
percent respectively, and in mid-July to 1.60 percent and 1.65
percent.
</P>
<P>
The latest move is seen as another government effort to boost
business production and step up Vietnam's financial system reforms
towards integration with the world system.

<HEADLINE> Demand for Australian Wool to Rise: Exporters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Demand for Australian wool will
increase when European processors return to work after the summer
holidays, the Australian Council of Wool Exporters said in a
statement released here today.
</P>
<P>
It said that increasing demand for fine wool caused prices to
firm slightly at sales this week as the eastern market indicator
closed at 615 Australian cents (480 U.S. cents) per kilogram
clean, up one cent at sales in Sydney and Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
"Exporters expect demand for wool will increase as European
buyers return and supply increases over the next weeks," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The offering in Sydney consisted mainly of premium 22 micron
and finer wool from Newcastle which is in short supply and strong
demand, as several buyers have commitments to supplying
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Prices for 20.5 micron and finer wool rose by around 60
Australian cents per kilogram clean while prices for 21 micron and
broader fell by 10 cents per kilogram.
</P>
<P>
A total of 69,468 bales of wool will go on sale in Sydney and
Fremantle next week, but scheduled Melbourne sales have been
canceled due to insufficient quantity.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Cuts Interest Rates After Record Low Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's State Bank will reduce
the monthly interest rates by 0.1 percentage point, the third time
to cut the rates this year, according to local press reports.
</P>
<P>
The reduction becomes effective on September 1.
</P>
<P>
The short-term ceiling rate will be 1.5 percent per month and
the long- and medium-term ceiling rate will be 1.55 percent for
all loans in the Vietnamese currency dong, while the ceiling rate
for foreign currency loans will remain at 9.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
But people's credit funds will have the highest rate of up to
2.1 percent per month and in rural areas the maximum rate on loans
will be 1.7 percent, down from 1.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The reduction followed an eight-month fall in the consumer
price index and a record low inflation of 2.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Interest rates on loans have fallen drastically in Vietnam
since the beginning of this year. In January, rates on short- and
long-term loans were cut from 2.0 percent to 1.75 percent and 1.7
percent respectively, and in mid-July to 1.60 percent and 1.65
percent.
</P>
<P>
The latest move is seen as another government effort to boost
business production and step up Vietnam's financial system reforms
towards integration with the world system.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Provide Forceful Evidence for Solar Neutrino Missing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- A young Chinese scientist has
achieved an important scientific breakthrough in a puzzle that has
perplexed international nuclear astrophysics circles for decades.
</P>
<P>
Liu Weiping and his colleagues have provided new evidence to
help solve the puzzle of the missing solar neutrino.
</P>
<P>
The international nuclear physics circles have held that the
verification of the phenomenon, and its revelation is of extremely
important scientific significance.
</P>
<P>
Scientists all over the world have conducted long-term and
costly research, but with no final conclusion reached on
the matter until now.
</P>
<P>
Liu, from the China Institute of Atomic Energy (CIAE), and his
colleagues have verified the solar neutrino missing problem by
using a 7Be beam produced by a secondary radioactive nuclear beam
built on the CIAE's tandem accelerator, and by taking advantage of
the astrophysical S-factor reflected by 7Be(p,y)8B which was
creatively gauged by a brand-new experimental method.
</P>
<P>
The scientific result has been acclaimed as "an outstanding
experiment" by the international nuclear physics circles. Details
of the experiment have been published by the prestigious Physical
Review Letters, the first time the magazine has carried one of
China's experimental nuclear physics papers in its history of over
40 years.
</P>
<P>
According to Bai Xixiang, a famous CIAE expert in the field of
radioactive nuclear beam physics, the so-called solar neutrino
missing refers to the phenomenon that the neutrino flux detected
on earth is less than 50 percent of that as predicted by
scientific theories.
</P>
<P>
This phenomenon has been a difficult problem perplexing the
international nuclear astrophysics circles ever since it was
discovered in 1968. It has involved a series of important
scientific research fields, including the standard solar model, the
cross section of thermal nuclear reaction, the neutrino detection
and the intrinsic property of neutrino.

<HEADLINE> North China County Explores Overseas Garment Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, August 30 (Xinhua) -- North China's "garment
town" is exploring opportunities in the overseas market.
</P>
<P>
With financial support, proper planning and flexible management
from Rongcheng County, the number of garment enterprises there has
soared to 700, with more than 3,500 households engaging in the
clothes production.
</P>
<P>
The county presently has seven overseas-funded garment
enterprises, which produce over one billion yuan (about 121
million US dollars) in output value, and export nearly 10 million
US dollars-worth of clothes annually.
</P>
<P>
In the past, most of the exports were monopolized by foreign
trade agencies, a practice that handicapped additional exports.
</P>
<P>
In order to send more goods overseas, the county's largest
garment manufacturer, the Liyou Shirt Factory, cooperated with the
Hebei Garment Imports and Exports Company in 1993 to establish a
sub-company, which had the rights to handle imports and exports
directly.
</P>
<P>
In May of 1995, a Sino-German garment company in the county
registered a subsidiary in Hungary, which enables the company to
sell clothes directly to that country.
</P>
<P>
Later, two additional companies from Rongcheng registered
overseas, one in Romania and another in the United Arab Emirates.

<HEADLINE> Farmer Entrepreneur Re-Creates Town for Opium Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Farmer entrepreneur Xu Wenrong
has handed over the keys to old Guangzhou Town.
</P>
<P>
Spanning 200,000 square meters with 160 buildings the town is
like a Qing Dynasty time warp.
</P>
<P>
Xu, general manager of the Hengdian Group in east China's
Zhejiang province, invested more than 40 million yuan (about five
million US dollars) re-creating the old town.
</P>
<P>
It will be used as the outdoor location during the shooting of
scenes for the two-part film "The Opium War".
</P>
<P>
Xu was delighted when he handed over Guangzhou Town to film
director Xie Jin.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year Xu learned that Xie Jin and his film group
needed money to build an outdoor location. He suggested to Xie
that the location be built in Hengdian and his company will
provide all the funds.
</P>
<P>
Xu invested more than 40 million yuan (about 5 million US
dollars) building Guangzhou Town, re-creating scenes from the Qing
Dynasty (1644-1911).
</P>
<P>
The town covers more than 200,000 square meters in area and
consists of 160 buildings with a total floor space of over 60,000
sq m.
</P>
<P>
Xu has his own reason for building the town.
</P>
<P>
He said, it was really galling and humiliating that the court
of the corrupt Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) ceded territory and paid
indemnities. It is pride of the Chinese nation that the Chinese
Government is resuming the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong
peacefully, Xu added.
</P>
<P>
Xie Jin has just moved into the town with his film crew to
shoot the blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
"The Opium War" is expected to make its Chinese screen debut on
July 1, 1997, -- the day China resumes the exercise of sovereignty
over Hong Kong.

DHAKA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
approved a draft law on private export processing zones (EPZs) to
allow private companies to set up such special economic zones in
the country, official sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The bill would give the sponsor company the authority and right

</P>
<P>
There are now two state-run EPZs in Bangladesh, one in the
capital city of Dhaka and the other in the country's largest port
city of Chittagong.
</P>
<P>
The bill was the outcome of a summit meeting between Bangladesh
and South Korean leaders in May 1995. The two sides agreed to
establish a privately managed EPZ sponsored by the Youngone
Corporation of South Korea, which already had large investments in
the government-owned EPZs in Bangladesh.
</P>

KAMPALA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Uganda will soon start to spray
herbicides on water hyacinth on Lake Victoria, the New Vision
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Wagonda Muguli, the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of
Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries, told the newspaper
yesterday that the Ugandan government is going ahead with the
aerial spraying of chemicals on the weed. Three chemicals, diquat
2, 4d (phenoxy compound) and glyphosate, are being tried on the
weed and huamns.
</P>
<P>
The permanent secretary said data show that the chemicals are
not harmful.
</P>
<P>
But still, he added, "the trials are necessary to accumulate data
on what the manufacturers say the chemical can do and to find out
if this can be achieved in our own environment".
</P>
<P>
He said that Tazania and Kenya, which share the lake with
Uganda, are aware of the spraying.
</P>
<P>
Muguli did not say when the operation would begin.
But the newspaper said it learned earlier that the spraying could
start next month.
</P>
<P>
The weed covered all bays of northern Lake Victoria and
strangled 90 percent of the rivers and lakes in Uganda. enditem

<HEADLINE> First Exposition held for Domestic Telecom Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- China is to hold its first
exposition for domestic brand-name telecom products in Chengdu,
capital of southwest China's Sichuan Province, on September 21.
</P>
<P>
The four-day-long event will cast focus on the latest
breakthroughs by Chinese enterprises in the telecommunications
industry, ranging from the mainstream products, external
equipment, testing apparatus to networks, according to China
Electronics News.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the central government's huge input in the
telecommunications business over recent years, China has developed
technically sophisticated switching equipment. The machines
include the HJD04, C&AMP;C08, EIM-601 and SP30, and complement
considerable progress made in SDH (synchronous digital hierarchy)
technology, the most advanced technical model for high-speed optic
telecom transmission.
</P>
<P>
The organizing committee said that the exposition will provide
a good opportunity for domestic enterprises to expand their market

<HEADLINE> Long-Term Unemployment Rises in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Long-term job seekers accounted
for 28.5 percent of Australia's total unemployed in July, up from
27.7 percent in June, according to figures released by the
Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) today.
</P>
<P>
The country's total jobless rate rose to 8.5 percent in July,
the ABS said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the number of people unemployed for two years or
more fell by 1.5 percent in July, seasonally adjusted, compared
with June while the number of people unemployed for more than 12
month but less than two years increased by 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
One of the most pessimistic predictions made in the new budget
is that Australia's unemployment rate will average 8.5 percent
throughout 1996-97, with no improvement from the figure in
1995-96, despite a further period of what the Treasury described
as "strong growth."

<HEADLINE> Plastic Containers to be Banned in More Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Major cities in China, worried
about the worsening of "white pollution," are taking drastic
measures to curb the use of disposable plastic containers.
</P>
<P>
Beginning September 1, those who sell or use the disposable
plastic containers in Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei
Province, will be punished.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by the Wuhan Municipal Government.
</P>
<P>
The industrial and commercial departments will confiscate the
plastic boxes, and the public security departments will prevent
such containers from entering the city.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 40,000 food stalls in the city. Every day,
more than one million people have breakfast outside their home, 50
percent of whom use throw-away plastic items.
</P>
<P>
Every year, more than 200 million of the containers are
estimated to be thrown away, causing environmental pollution and
strong opposition from citizens.
</P>
<P>
Such containers will also be banned in Guangzhou, capital of
south China's Guangdong Province before the end of this year,
according to a report from a recent mayor's meeting.
</P>
<P>
At present, more than 500,000 of the plastic containers are
used in the city daily.
</P>
<P>
A research team will be set up in Guangzhou to develop
decomposable plastic containers.

<HEADLINE> 100,000 Expected to Pray at Al-Aqsa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Some 100,000 Palestinians
today are expected to heed Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
President Yasser Arafat's call to participate in massive Friday
prayers at the Al-Aqsa Mosque in the Old city of Jerusalem,
Palestinian Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Hassan Tahboub, head of the Higher Islamic Council, said that
if a total closure was not imposed, more people would come to
Al-Aqsa to converge there for Friday prayers.
</P>
<P>
Arafat asked both Palestinian and Israeli Arab Muslims to come
to pray at the Al-Aqsa Mosque, to show solidarity with the PNA and
demonstrate protest against the Israeli government's policies on
expanding Jewish settlements in the West Bank and limiting
Palestinian activities in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Radio said that those who cannot reach Jerusalem,
due to the half-year long closure on the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip imposed by Israel, were told to gather at the checkpoints
at the entrance to the city.
</P>
<P>
If they are turned back, they may go and pray on land
designated for expropriation by the Israeli authorities, to
protest settlement expansion, the report added.
</P>
<P>
The PNA Information Ministry Thursday called for the
establishment of local committees to fight land expropriation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, hundreds of Israeli policemen are being brought
into Jerusalem today, as security forces brace for possible
unrest at the Al-Aqsa Mosque.
</P>
<P>
"We are taking (Arafat's call) seriously," Internal Security
Minister Avigdor Kahalani was quoted by today's Jerusalem Post as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Friday afternoon prayers are traditionally the most crowded at
the Al-Aqsa Mosque, and the size of today's crowd is largely
dependent on whether a closure is imposed, Israeli security
sources said.
</P>
<P>
"We will not allow inciters onto the Temple Mount (where
Al-Aqsa stands)," Kahalani said, "if we have to we will using
force, but I hope we will not have to."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Police Inspector-General Assaf Hefetz said
that police would not allow protest marches by Palestinians in
East Jerusalem today, which, in his words, "may lead to
disturbances.".
</P>
<P>
"We will give maximum freedom to worshipers without risking
the possibility of rioting, and we hope that police will not be
forced to enter the Temple Mount, which we would interpret as an
extreme step," the police chief said.
</P>
<P>
Those who have no authorization to enter Jerusalem will not be
allowed to enter, Hefetz said, and roadblocks will be manned by
both police and the Israeli army.
</P>
<P>
He added that the security forces have been gathering
intelligence information to prevent any potential disturbances or
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani held a special meeting with Hefetz and other police
brass Thursday to discuss stringent security arrangements, in the
wake of Arafat's call.
</P>
<P>
The minister reportedly said that water cannons and mounted
police would be used only "if there is no choice."

<HEADLINE> Italy Expresses Deep Worry Over Israel's Actions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Italy is expressing "deep worry"
over Israel's recent actions on Palestinian territory, and
promises to continue its role in prodding the Middle East peace
process along.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made in a news release today by the Italian
Foreign Ministry. It referred to Israel's plans for building
2,000 houses on the West Bank as "compelling" and "hostile"
actions.
</P>
<P>
It said this action would do no good for regional peace and
stability and might result in new tensions in the area.
</P>
<P>
The statement appealed to the Israeli authorities to stop the
the building and go back to the negotiating table, and hold talks
in conformity with the spirit of agreements reached so far with
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
According to the news release, Italian Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini today met Ossama el-Bazz, the special envoy sent by
Egyptian President Muhammed Mubarak, and heard his report on the
latest progress of the Middle East peace process, especially the
Israel-Palestine talks.
</P>
<P>
Dini praised Egypt for its important and positive role in
prompting peace in the Middle East and promised that Italy would
continue with its peace-seeking efforts in the area.
</P>
<P>
El-Bazz, presidential advisor on political affairs, stressed
that unprecedented progress had been made in the Middle East peace
process, with the efforts of the international community and other
factors in the area.
</P>
<P>
But there was still a long way to go towards lasting peace and
stability in the area.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it was important to keep the positive role of
Europe undiminished at this difficult and delicate moment in the
process.
</P>
<P>
He said Egypt hoped Italy would continue give a positive
prodding to the peace process, and would urge members of the
European Union to show support and concern over the Middle East.

<HEADLINE> SADC, COMESA Should Integrate, Says Malawian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Malawian President Bakili Muluzi
said here last night there was need for the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) and the Common Market for Eastern
and Southern Africa (COMESA) to integrate to realize rapid
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
At a banquet hosted for him by Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe at
State House, Muluzi said African countries needed to work together
because it was only as one that it would grow economically and
socially.
</P>
<P>
''Regional integration is the name of the game in the world today,
our region cannot afford to be left behind. No nation can afford to
do it alone and the success of one nation is the success of the
other,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''We must work together. African countries need each
other. If we fail as a result of not working together now, future
generations will never forgive us for having missed the
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
Muluzi arrived here yesterday for a three-day official visit to
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Turning to peace and political stability, he said Zimbabwe and
Malawi should continue to work together in mediation efforts aimed at
maintaining peace and stability in the region and Africa as well.
</P>
<P>
''We now know from experience that if there is not peace in one
country, there cannot be real peace in the region. We therefore have
a duty to make war and conflict unfashionable,'' Muluzi said.

<HEADLINE> a Product of Compromises Between Philippine Government, MNLF (By Chen Hegao) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- A peace agreement which was
initialed today by negotiators of the Philippine government and
the Muslim Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) after three years
of hard bargaining could provide the best opportunity for peace in
Mindanao, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
But the peace accord, initialed in the Indonesian capital of
Jakarta and to be formally signed in Manila on Monday, was, as
many would agree, a product of compromises, they said.
</P>
<P>
The peace pact is to end a 24-year-old civil war in Mindanao,
where the bloody conflict has turned the main southern island into
a battle zone and claimed more than 120,000 lives, many of them
innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
Although both sides have been ready for a peaceful settlement
for a long time knowing there is no chance of winning the war
which broke out in 1972, the peace deal seems still to have come a
bit sooner than expected given the arduousness of the negotiations
and the severity of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Despite repeatedly denials by the government, speculation is
rife that a behind-the-scenes, give-and-take deal was struck
between the government and the Muslim rebels.
</P>
<P>
Both the government and the Muslim rebel group have apparently
made concessions to secure the peace deal after they realized that
the Mindanao conflict was a no-win war for both sides.
</P>
<P>
The peace pact, therefore, is the product of "serious talks and
compromises," as MNLF Chairman Nur Misuari put it before he left
for Jakarta for the final round of peace talks last Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to government negotiator Eduardo Ermita, the
Philippine government lost 73 billion pesos (2.78 billion U.S.
dollars) in the 24 years of conflict with the MNLF, and spent 30
percent of its military budget in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Of 120,000 casualties recorded in the past two decades, at
least 50 percent came from the MNLF side, 30 percent from
government troops and 20 percent from innocent civilians, he said.
</P>
<P>
For the Ramos administration, which has already succeeded in
reviving the nation's economy, an early end to the Mindanao war
would not only contribute to the political stability and economic
prosperity, but also help President Ramos be remembered as a peace
maker, which in turn could assist the ruling party in its bid to
win again in the 1998 general elections.
</P>
<P>
For the MNLF, a political settlement could help it gain what it
failed to on the battlefield. Its leaders have realized that the
war was being fought at enormous economic, social and political
costs to the depressed Muslim community in Mindanao and the entire
nation.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, the government will set up a new and expanded
autonomous region in Mindanao, while the MNLF will abandon its
armed struggle for a separate Moro homeland.
</P>
<P>
However, the government side appears to have made more
concessions by agreeing to set up the controversial Southern
Philippine Council for Peace and Development (SPCPD), analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the council will be headed by MNLF
Chairman Misuari and charged with coordinating peace and
development in 14 provinces and 10 cities in Mindanao for three
years.
</P>
<P>
A referendum will be held in three years' time to determine
which of the 14 provinces and 10 cities will join the new
autonomous region, which will replace the current one that
comprises only four Muslim-dominated provinces.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Lakas-National Union of Christian Democrats also
endorsed Misuari as the candidate for governor of the current
autonomous region in Muslim Mindanao in the September election,
which Misuari is sure to win with the government help.
</P>
<P>
As governor of the autonomous region and chairman of the SPCPD,
Misuari will become the most powerful man in Mindanao. The
overwhelming power offered to the MNLF by the government has
aroused strong protests in the Philippines, and particularly in
Mindanao, where Christians account for 85 percent of the total
20-million population.
</P>
<P>
Some congressmen accused the government of making too many
concessions to the MNLF by allowing the rebel group to dominate
the council. Christians in Mindanao said that with the
establishment of the MNLF-led council, the government is imposing
actual Muslim rule on the Christians.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of integrating 7,500 MNLF fighters into the army
and the police, the government made yet another compromise in the
last minute, waiving all its previous requirements for the
integration when the two sides came to a deadlock in the final
round of talks in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
But the MNLF also made concessions at the final stage of
negotiations under international pressure.
</P>
<P>
Misuari said that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) and members of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) forum have been pressing him to accept the government
formula and sign the peace agreement in spite of disagreements on
some major issues.
</P>
<P>
Misuari has also reportedly yielded to the pressure from the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), which represents 51
Muslim nations. The group has argued that Ramos' formula was the
best that the rebels could hope for.

<HEADLINE> US Coastal to Invest 500 Million Dollars in China's Power Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The Coastal Group, one of the 50
largest industrial companies in the United States, will invest 500
million US dollars to expand a power plant in southwest China's
Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
This has been the largest overseas-funded project in Sichuan,
provincial officials said.
</P>
<P>
The investment will be used to expand the second-phase project
of the Huangjuezhuang Power Plant, located in Yibin in the
southern part of Sichuan Province, an energy base in China.
</P>
<P>
Total investment in the second-phase project of the plant, a
key state power undertaking in the Ninth Five-Year Plan Period
(1996-2000), are estimated at 10 billion yuan (about 1.2 billion
US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Two 600-MW generating units are expected to be installed
for the second-phase project by 1998, project officials said.
</P>
<P>
The first-phase project of the coal-fired power plant, which
went on line in 1993, has 400-MW generating units.
</P>
<P>
David Arledge, president of the Coastal Group, said that energy
companies will get more and better opportunities if they invest in
the land-locked province of China.
</P>
<P>
It has been the most important step Coastal has made in
China, he said.
</P>
<P>
Arledge also showed strong interest in the development of
natural gas in Sichuan, noting that his group will increase
cooperation with the province in the development of natural
gas.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1955, Coastal has more than 10 billion US dollars
of assets and 16,600 employees. The group's supplies of gas and
chemicals account for 12 percent and five percent of America's
total respectively.

having maintained an annual growth rate of one billion yuan (about
120 million US dollars) in output value over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Wuhan, the capital of central China's Hubei Province, has an
abundance of cotton yarn, which is regarded as "soft gold" in the
European market.
</P>
<P>
The city had only about 100 garment-making enterprises five
years ago, but the number has soared to more than 1,300.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government has established the Wuhan Council for
the Promotion of Garments Industry and Commerce, in a bid to push
more garments onto the markets in other parts of the country and
the world.

<HEADLINE> North China Province Wants Huge Investments for Expressways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, August 30 (Xinhua) -- North China's Hebei
Province is eager to attract eight billion yuan (about 964 million
US dollars) for the construction of four expressways.
</P>
<P>
Investments in expressways can be recovered in about eight
years, local officials said. The province allows overseas
investors to hold shares, and the operating period can be up to 25
years.
</P>
<P>
These expressways include a 127-km long section of the
Xuanhua-Datong expressway, which needs a total investment of two
billion yuan; a 213-km expressway linking Shijiazhuang with
Cangzhou, requires an investment of three billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The others are a 143-km-long section of the Beijing-Shanghai
expressway, which needs 2.8 billion yuan, and the Tangshan-Tianjin
expressway that will cost about 500 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Hebei is adjacent to China's largest coal producer, Shanxi
Province. Coal transportation in Hebei is very busy. Every day
over 25,000 automobiles, especially heavy-duty trucks, travel
along the major expressways of Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
Hebei began to build expressways in 1987. So far, roadways with
a total length of 300 km in the province have opened to
traffic. Of these, the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan expressway, which is
over 70 km long, was jointly funded by Chinese and overseas
investors and is operated by the overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
The province is presently using 240 million US dollars of loans
extended by the World Bank to construct a 240-km expressway from
Shijiazhuang to Henan Province's Anyang City. It is expected to be
completed in 1998.
</P>
<P>
A 198-km expressway from Beijing to Qinhuangdao, which utilizes
200 million US dollars lent by the Asian Development Bank, is
scheduled for completion in 1999. Hebei Province is also raising
money for the construction of the Baoding-Tianjin expressway.

<HEADLINE> China Further Regulates Securities Exchanges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- China is stepping up efforts to
regulate its securities exchanges with a new set of regulations
drafted and issued to replace the existing three-year-old
provisional rules.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations cover a wider range of areas, such as
approving or dismantling securities exchanges, their functions and
management mechanisms, and also trading and settlement in the
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
"The newly-issued regulations represent an important step
forward in the standardization of China's securities market," said
an official from Securities Commission of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Securities exchanges were ordered to stay away from any
profit-oriented business activities and the press sector. They are
neither allowed to release written materials and data that
forecast securities prices nor allowed to provide others with
guarantees.
</P>
<P>
Supervision over members of the exchanges and listed companies
is also tightened, requiring the companies to disclose relevant
information immediately in the event of any unusual fluctuations
in their stock prices.
</P>
<P>
Management personnel in securities exchanges and securities
registration and settlement companies are prohibited from holding
concurrent positions in any commercial institutions, and will be
severely punished for leaking or taking the advantage of inside
information.
</P>
<P>
"The newly-imposed regulations are more comprehensive and
feasible than the old ones, and will be carried out more
smoothly," said the official, adding that regulations over the
securities registration and settlement companies were a new and
necessary addition to those used in the past.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 30 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli soldier was killed
in a close-range clash with Hezbollah gunmen in south Lebanon,
press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The fighting took place Thursday afternoon in Jabal Balat
village, not far from the border. Reports of the clash were
released only after the family of the victim was notified, Israel
Radio and local newspapers said.
</P>
<P>
The soldier was killed when he and his team encountered a
Hezbollah squad, military sources were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
There were no immediate reports of casualties among the
attackers, who were apparently planning a large-scale attack on
Israeli troops, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Hezbollah gunmen also fired mortars at
the same area, and Israeli forces returned fire with at least 100
artillery rounds.
</P>
<P>
Israeli fighter planes dropped flares and helicopters conducted
 a search for the retreating Hezbollah gunmen, as the firing
continued into late Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The shelling focused mainly on Yatar, north of the Israeli
self-claimed security zone, which has been a hotbed of
anti-Israeli activities for years.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, reports from south Lebanon said two Lebanese
civilians were wounded as a result of Hezbollah mortar fires at
an Israeli military position in Shkhnin.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the year, a total of 19 Israeli
soldiers have been killed in clashes in south Lebanon with
Hezbollah forces, who have been fighting ferociously the Israeli
occupation.

<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, August 30 (Xinhua) -- An agricultural sideline products
market established by the land-locked Shaanxi Province will open
in the coastal province of Guangdong in mid-October.
</P>
<P>
The market will help Shaanxi to send its produce directly to the
coastal markets. Establishment of a market in Shanghai is also
under deliberation.
</P>
<P>
A major producer of agricultural sideline goods, Shaanxi has
actively readjusted its agricultural production structure in
recent years. Development of such products, headed by the growth
of apples, has become a pillar of of the province's agro-economy.
</P>
<P>
At present, the province is sending a large quantity of items to
the coastal areas, especially in Guangdong and Shanghai. Every
year 150,000 tons of pork, poultry, eggs and fruit are transported
to Guangzhou by railway.
</P>
<P>
In order to explore business opportunities in the coast and even
in the overseas markets, Shaanxi has established a 2.5-ha market
for direct sales of its native products in Dongguan, Guangdong
Province. Investment in the market totalled 45 million yuan (about
542,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of the market's stands have been purchased by various
cities, counties or individuals.
</P>
<P>
Huang Guangwen, vice-secretary of the provincial government,
said that he hopes every prefecture, city or county in Shaanxi
will have at least one stand at the market, so that they can use
the market as a link to the outside world.

<P>
NEW YORK, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Wimbledon finalist MaliVai
Washington and Chilean talent Marcelo Rios both crashed out at the
second round of the U.S. Open Tennis Championships on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 11th-seeded Washington fell to fellow American wildcard
Alex O'Brien 6-3, 6-4, 5-7, 3-6, 6-3 in a two hour 51 minute
struggle, while 10th seed Rios lost to Wimbledon bad boy Jeff
Tarango 6-4, 4-6, 7-6 (7-5), 6-2.
</P>
<P>
The 65th-ranked O'Brien, a winner two weeks ago in New Haven
for his first pro title, served for the match at 5-4 in the third
set before Washington came charging back.
</P>
<P>
O'Brien, a former U.S. collegiate national champion, fired up
17 aces throughout the match.
</P>
<P>
The fifth set stayed on serve until the sixth game, when
Washington, after saving one break point with a forehand winner
down the line, netted a backhand to give O'Brien a 4-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
The big server blasted in two aces to hold serve at 5-2 and
then converted his eighth match point for victory when Washington
found the net with another backhand from 40-0.
</P>
<P>
Tarango, whose tantrum at Wimbledon two years ago brought him a
28,000 U.S. dollars fine and suspension from this year's
tournament at the All-England Club, needed two hour, 24 minutes to
eliminate Rios on the grandstand.
</P>
<P>
The match turned on the third-set tiebreaker, which the
104th-ranked American won 7-5 finally.

<HEADLINE> Guangxi to Make Nine-year Compulsory Education Universal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region has established a multi-channel system for
raising money in order to make nine-year compulsory education
universal.
</P>
<P>
Educational funds are mostly earmarked by the government,
according to an official of the Regional Education Commission.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary statistics, Guangxi has spent 24.88
billion yuan on the educational sector in the past ten
years. Nearly 64 percent of of the money comes from
governments at all levels.
</P>
<P>
Most of the funds were used to build, rebuild, and repair
school buildings, and to purchase teaching supplies, books and
materials, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the total floor space of the school buildings of
middle schools and primary schools in Guangxi is 40.17 million
square meters, 13.28 million sq m more than in 1986.
</P>
<P>
As an autonomous region inhabited by 12 ethnic groups, Guangxi
is less developed than coastal areas, but the local governments
are doing their utmost to speed up the development of the
educational sector, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has
listed the the ratio of students receiving nine-year compulsory
education as a major index for achieving a relatively comfortable
standard of living for Guangxi residents.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1995, Guangxi had 16,005 primary schools with a
total enrollment of almost 6.4 million, a 17.6 percent increase
from 1986.
</P>
<P>
All of the 108 counties in Guangxi had made primary education
universal. About 98 percent of school-age children are in school.
</P>
<P>
The region currently has 2,668 junior middle schools with a
total of 1.75 million students, up 21 percent and 63 percent,
respectively, from 1986.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu to Meet Arafat Soon, Official Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu is to meet Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
President Yasser Arafat "very soon", a senior Israeli official was
 quoted as saying today.
</P>
<P>
But the official in the Prime Minister's Office added that
such a meeting would only take place if there are "no untoward
events", the Jerusalem Post reported.
</P>
<P>
He did not elaborate on the possible date or place of this
meeting.
</P>
<P>
As tension heightens between Israel and the PNA after Arafat
blasted Israel's policies on settlements and Jerusalem, pressure
is mounting on Netanyahu to meet with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, under pressure from President Ezer Weizman earlier
this week, said he would meet Arafat but such a meeting must be
"substantial and not ceremonial".
</P>
<P>
Before that, the hardline leader had refused to meet Arafat,
whom he charged during the election campaign with harboring
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, former Labor Prime Minister Shimon Peres and Meretz
leader Yossi Sarid called Thursday on Netanyahu to meet with
Arafat immediately, warning any delay would increase tension and
deteriorate the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Peres, chief architect of the peace process, was often
ridiculed by rightist activists for his frequent meetings with
Arafat during the May election campaign, in which he was defeated
by Netanyahu with a razor-thin lead.
</P>
<P>
Peres told the Army Radio that a Netanyahu-Arafat meeting
should have taken place a long time ago. "One shouldn't place too
much hope in one meeting, but the fact that the meeting was put
off without any logical reason and needlessly only made things
worse," he said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Arafat's recent actions, Peres said that the
problem was not the strike, "but rather the fact that the peace
process has started to limp along rather than advance."
</P>
<P>
"I knew that such a process must either be nurtured and moved
along, or stopped, and then other things happen," he added. He
described the Palestinians as "a key to peace in the Middle
East."
</P>
<P>
Sarid blasted Netanyahu for his "stupid" self-importance and
haughtiness and stressed that Arafat "should be treated with
respect"
</P>
<P>
"Netanyahu was elected in direct elections, but that does not
make him the top leader in the region, and does not allow him to
treat the PA chairman as if he was his subject, and even subjects
aren't treated like this," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the Likud-led government to stop raising
tensions, then telling people to be calm.
</P>
<P>
Arafat outpoured his anger Wednesday on Israel's policies of
expanding settlements and cracking down PNA's activities in
Jerusalem, by calling on Palestinians to stage a general strike
Thursday and stage a massive pilgrimage to the Al-Aksa Mosque in
east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Israeli police and security forces are
put on the highest alert today in anticipation of possible
anti-Israeli violence.

DHAKA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The situation in Bangladesh's
trouble-torn Bogra, a northern town in the northwest to the
capital Dhaka, remained tense as an all-party meeting there
Thursday ended inconclusively while transport strike continued.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Bogra worsened when the body of a student with
bullet wounds, who had been detained by police following a
students-transport workers clash, was recovered from a local river
on August 23 and 4 others were shot dead by police the next day
during a demonstration.
</P>
<P>
According to sources today, the 3-hour all-party meeting under
the local district authorities was held from 13:00 Thursday with
the absence of student leaders and it could produce no result.
</P>
<P>
The students, backed by the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist
Party (BNP) and the Jamaat-e-Islami, brought out a procession and
held a rally in the town, threatening to make the district
administration "inoperative" in case of its failure to accept
their demands within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
They earlier demanded the arrest of those police personnel
responsible for the killing of students, withdrawal of cases
against students during the recent clashes and raising of the
amount of compensation for the victims' families.
</P>
<P>
Due to the tense situation, all shops, educational
institutions, and firms remained closed, all sorts of vehicles
stayed off the roads and no train could reach or leave the local
station, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Accepts Nomination for Second Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHICAGO, August 29 (Xinhua) -- United States President Bill
Clinton, accepting the Democratic Party's nomination for
re-election, today called for the country to stay on the "right
track to the 21st century".
</P>
<P>
He said: "Let us build a bridge to help parents raise their
children, to make our streets safe, to help young people and
adults get the education and training they need, to help Americans
succeed at home and abroad, to break the cycle of poverty and
dependency."
</P>
<P>
In his acceptance speech Clinton proposed a jobs program for
welfare recipients.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said
Clinton's initiative in inner cities would include three billion
dollars in grants to create jobs in high-poverty areas, and 500
million dollars in tax credits for businesses that employ people
who have been on welfare for at least 18 months.
</P>
<P>
Democrat delegates Wednesday night renominated Clinton for a
second run at the White House.
</P>
<P>
If Clinton succeeds, he would be the the first Democratic
president to win re-election since Franklin D. Roosevelt half a
century ago.
</P>
<P>
The four-day Democratic National Convention, which started on
Monday, culminated in Clinton's acceptance speech at its closing
session tonight in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
The welfare initiative is designed as an effort of the current
administration to mitigate the potential effect of the
controversial welfare overhaul bill that Clinton signed last week.
</P>
<P>
The convention also nominated Albert Gore the candidate for a
second term as vice-president.
</P>
<P>
White House Chief of Staff Leo Panetta said in a briefing that
the president's general theme here was going to be building a
bridge to the future as opposed to a bridge to the past.
</P>
<P>
White House aides described Clinton's initiative as the first
in a number of steps to take the stings out of the welfare
overhaul bill he signed, despite professed misgivings for some of
its components.
</P>
<P>
In their speeches Tuesday night, Jesse Jackson and former New
York Governor Mario M. Cuomo criticized the move. But government
officials said the signing of the bill was just a beginning rather
than the end of welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also said in his acceptance speech: "We must not be
divided. We must say no to discrimination, wherever it occurs,
whenever it occurs. We cannot carry the divisions of the past
into the future."
</P>
<P>
In his one-hour-plus speech, Clinton also touched upon other
topics including economy and budget, fighting terrorism,
environmental protection and foreign policies.
</P>
<P>
Before arriving here Wednesday, Clinton made a four-day train
trek campaign through key Mid-West states including Ohio and
Michigan, stating a new campaign initiative each day.
</P>
<P>
In his Thursday speech, he said the trip showed that "America
is on the right track."
</P>
<P>
Clinton's proposals during the train trek involved gun control,
teenage literacy and environmental protection. He arrived in
Chicago Wednesday in time for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
He said to a welcoming gathering at the University of
Illinois-Chicago that he was ready for what he called "the first
American campaign for the 21st century and the last campaign for
Bill Clinton".
</P>
<P>
In his convention speech Wednesday, Vice-President Gore
defended the administration's record on such issues as economy,
crime fighting, education and environment.
</P>
<P>
Gore said: "Bill Clinton and I offer ourselves as a bridge to
the future."

<HEADLINE> Canon to Produce Ink Cartridges in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Canon Incorporated will produce
replaceable ink cartridges for its Bubble-Jet printers in the
United States from March 1997, Canon officials say.
</P>
<P>
The cartridges will be test-produced by Canon's branch company
in California at a monthly rate of 250,000 units from March, with
an output target of 1.75 million units by 1999.
</P>
<P>
Canon also planned to increase production at its manufacturing
unit, Nagahama Canon Inc., Shiga Prefecure in western Japan, to
1.75 million units next year.
</P>
<P>
Canon had planned to introduce new production lines costing 10
billion yen (about 75 million U.S. dollars), said the officials.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Canon was expected to raise its monthly production
around the world by 50 percent to 8.8 million units.
</P>
<P>
Replaceable ink cartridges now accounted for one-fourth of the
company's revenues in the Bubble-Jet printer division, which
reached 230 billion yen (17 billion dollars) in the fiscal 1995
year ending December.

<HEADLINE> Austrian Chancellor to Express Middle East Worries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Both Austria and the European
Union (EU) are concerned about the continuation of the Middle East
peace process, Austrian Federal Chancellor Franz Vranitzky said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference before a visit to Israel and
Palestine, Vranitzky said he would express the concern of his
country and the EU during his visit to the two Middle East
countries.
</P>
<P>
Vranitzky is scheduled to leave on Sunday. He will be the first
government head to visit Israel since the Jewish state's new
government took in office in June.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether he would act as a mediator between Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, Vranitzky said it depended on the situation.
</P>
<P>
But he added that his country was willing to contribute to
pushing forward the Middle East peace process, which was
stalemated as Netanyahu opposed land-for-peace deals with
Palestine and other Arab states.
</P>
<P>
Vranitzky noted that he had discussed his Middle East trip with
EU Commission President Jacques Santer and German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, and that the EU gave positive comment on the visit.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Israel, Vranitzky will also attend the
Middle East Youth Forum to be held in Eilat.
</P>
<P>
Young people from Israel, Palestine, Jordan and Austria will
take part in the forum sponsored by Austria's Bruno-Kreisky
Forum.

<HEADLINE> 11 People Injured in Protest-Triggered Clash in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Eleven people were
injured today in a fresh clash between security forces and peasant
protesters in Colombia's southern province of Caqueta.
</P>
<P>
The clash came amid a growing controversy in Bogota over
official curbs on television coverage of the peasant protests
seeking crop aid and eradication of poverty.
</P>
<P>
The National Television Commission has banned all TV reports
about the protests based on anything but official sources, as well
as TV news programs showing any images related to the protests.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that troops opened fire with tear gas and live
ammunition to halt the surge of thousands of peasants marching
toward a military barricade on a bridge leading into the
provincial capital of Florencia.
</P>
<P>
They said all the gunfire appeared to come from the military
side of the barricade.
</P>
<P>
Among those injured was a cameraman who refused to hand over
the film shot from the scene of the violence.
</P>
<P>
In other similar clashes in recent weeks, military officials
insisted that rebels opened fire on protesters and then sought to
blame the bloodshed on government troops.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of peasants have staged protests in
Caqueta and neighboring Putumayo and Guaviare provinces since last
month to press for more government aid for crop substitution, and
for the eradication of poverty in Colombia's jungle-covered
south.

<HEADLINE> Mindanao Peace Agreement Initialed in Jakarta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- A final agreement to end a
25-year-long conflict in the Southern Philippines was initialed
here today by the Philippine government and the Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF) after the conclusion of their fourth round
of talks which began on August 28.
</P>
<P>
The final peace agreement was initialed at the State Palace by
MNLF leader Nur Musuari and Philippine government representative
Manuel T. Yan.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was witnessed by Indonesian President Soeharto and
Assistant Secretary-General of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference (OIC) Mohammed Mohsin.
</P>
<P>
The peace agreement allows the formation of the Southern
Philippine Council for Peace and Development, to be headed by MNLF
Chairman Misuari, to coordinate peace and development in 14
provinces and 10 cities in Mindanao for three years.
</P>
<P>
A referendum will be held in three years' time to determine
which of the 14 provinces and 10 cities join a new autonomous
region, which will replace the current one that includes only four
Muslim-dominated provinces.
</P>
<P>
Known as Moros, the Muslim population of more than five million
in the Southern Philippines has been fighting for autonomy in the
predominantly Catholic state.
</P>
<P>
The peace process began in mid-1970 under the aegis of the OIC
which produced the 1976 tripartite agreement. That became the
foundation for future peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
However, it was not until 1993, with Indonesia acting as
facilitator, that negotiations recommenced. Since then Indonesia
has hosted three formal rounds of peace talks between the
Philippine government and the MNLF.
</P>
<P>
During a mixed committee meeting here on Wednesday, negotiators
wrapped up the remaining points, including the integration of the
7,500 MNLF troops into the Philippine army and police.
</P>
<P>
Other points which have been agreed upon are Moro
representation in the national government, the educational system,
the judiciary and the sharing of profits in the region.
</P>
<P>
The two sides signed a 1996 interim agreement and adopted the
final peace agreement late last night.
</P>
<P>
The final peace treaty will be formally signed in Manila,
capital of the Philippines on September 2.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Approaches Economic Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Mexican government is
approaching its targets for economic growth, inflation control,
rates of exchange stability, and control of external disturbances,
says the Mexican Inverlat financial group.
</P>
<P>
The group forecasts the achievement of the targets, pointing to
a low devaluation of the Mexican currency this year.
</P>
<P>
Although the 20.5-percent inflation projected for the close of
1996 had already been surpassed, the economic growth would be one
percentage point higher than the estimated three percent.
</P>
<P>
The results partially restored the confidence of economic
agents in the economic policy decisions, and in the objectives and
means, Inverlat stresses.
</P>
<P>
According to the Inverlat study, official targets had not been
enunciated for a long time, and official figures had never been
better than those forecast by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
Economic policies implemented so far by the authorities were
appropriate for preventing the economy getting out of kilter as in
1994, says the Inverlat.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Prepares to Launch Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Brazil will launch "in the next
few months" the first prototype of its satellite-carrying rocket,
preparing for sending a satellite on its own for the first time,
Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The prototype of Brazil's Satellite Launching Vehicle (VLS)
will be launched from Alcantara, a launching center in the
northeastern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
The four-staged VLS, 20-meter tall, will carry Brazil's third
Data Collection Satellite (SCD), with the first launched outside
the country in 1993 and the second offered to international
bidding last week.
</P>
<P>
Test launches of four prototypes are planned before the
launching of the VLS, which will carry satellites, ranging in
weight from 100 to 350 kilograms, to orbits of 200 to 1,000
kilometers around the Earth, the Brazilian Space Agency said.
</P>
<P>
A Sonda II rocket was launched Tuesday from the space center to
perfect the launching and tracking skills of ground staff at
Alcantara.
</P>
<P>
The VLS, long awaited, has been stuck for 15 years by a lack of
funds and a former boycott of Brazil by leading technological
nations.
</P>
<P>
Until October last year, Brazil was officially forbidden to
purchase rocket equipment by the Missile Technology Control Regime
for suspicions over its nuclear ambitions over a period from 1964
to 1985.
</P>
<P>
But Brazil, which owns the biggest and most advanced space
institution in Latin America, is working hard to fulfill its dream
of a place in space. It now has satellite and space projects with
China, the United States, France, Russia, Malaysia, Mexico and
Argentina.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan President Calls For Accelerating Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA-ATA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan President Nursultan
Nazarbayev said today the main task facing the government
is to accelerate the transition to market economy and let the
people feel the positive results.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting commemorating the first anniversary of the
country's new constitution held at the Alma-Ata Republic Palace,
Nazarbayev said that the government should create necessary
conditions for the transition to market economy and take measures
to ensure the success of the reform process.
</P>
<P>
He said although the new constitution was proclaimed only a
year ago, it has played a vital role in establishing national
system and expediting reform.
</P>
<P>
However, much is left to be done so that every citizen will
come to know his or her rights and obligations endowed by the
constitution, he said.
</P>
<P>
The new constitution was approved in a referendum on August 30
last year in which 89 percent of the people were reported in
favor.

OTTAWA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government has
protested over Israel's demolition of a Palestinian playground
paid for by Canadian taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
The playground was part of a community center in a Palestinian
quarter of Jerusalem which was destroyed by workers backed by
Israeli soldiers early this week.
</P>
<P>
"We find it to be regrettable and provocative and we are
conveying that to the government of Israel," Canadian Foreign
Affairs spokesman Rodney Moore said.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government had demanded an explanation for the
action. "We are not satisfied with the (present) explanation
provided by Israel to justify the actions taken," he said.
</P>
<P>
Canada also believed the Israeli action would make matters
worse in Jerusalem, he added.

<HEADLINE> Yunan Province Moves to Clean up Tourist Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- A crackdown on illegal
activities in the tourist market has been launched in southwest
China's Yunan Province, in a move to secure the healthy
development of the area's fledgling industry.
</P>
<P>
Yunan, known for its tropical scenery, animals and products,
has become one of the most attractive tourist spots in China,
since the country implemented policies of reform and openness in
the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, more than 16 million travelers visited the province
and spent over six billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
However, the province's booming tourist industry has been
marred by local people who violated related laws and infringed on
the legal rights of tourist agencies and tourists.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government is cracking down on illegal
activities through this campaign, which will include all of the
agencies, hotels, restaurants, shops, recreation centers and
individuals that are involved in the industry.
</P>
<P>
Those who have violated laws will be severely punished,
according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
Yunan is aiming at building its tourist sector into a leading
industry of the province.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Families in China's capital,
Beijing, have steadily improved their housing conditions since
1990 as a result of increased government investment in housing
construction.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted by the Beijing Municipal Statistics Bureau
shows that per-capita living space in Beijing averaged 13.73
square meters at the end of 1995, 2.56 sq m more than in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The survey also indicates that per-capita floor space in the
city was 18.3 sq m in 1995 and that Beijing urban families have
2.54 rooms on average .
</P>
<P>
Two-fifths of urban residents live in one-storey houses and the
rest in apartment buildings.
</P>
<P>
Some 90 percent of the residents living in apartment buildings
have their own kitchens and restrooms, and 98 percent use cooking
gas from pipes or bottled gas.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, 82 percent of those living in one-story houses
have their own kitchens, only 30 percent have their own toilets,
and 56 percent have gas from pipes or bottled gas.
</P>
<P>
The survey also demonstrated that only 6.68 percent of urban
families still live in the houses built before 1949, 35.58 percent
in the houses built in the 1950s and the 1970s and 57.74 percent
in apartments built after the 1980s.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Twelve people were killed
late Wednesday and early today in fights between rebel guerrillas
and government troops in the Guerrero and Oaxaca states.
</P>
<P>
Reuters quoted government sources as saying 10 members of the
security forces and two rebels were killed while 22 others were
injured in the overnight fights. It was the most serious conflict
since the Zapatista rebellion erupted in the southeastern state of
Chiapas in January 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican government denounced the killings as "an act of
brutal terror" by the self-proclaimed Popular Revolutionary Army
(EPR).
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas launched attacks upon police and military
outposts in the two states.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Interior Minister Arturo Nunez said that rebel
guerrillas also attacked an army post in the central state of
Mexico near the capital, where three people were wounded.
</P>
<P>
Five people have been arrested in the town of Tixtla on

<HEADLINE> Lebed's Chechnya Peace Plan Needs More Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 29 (Xinhua) - Security chief Alexander Lebed's
peace plan for a political solution to the 20-month Chechen war
"needs serious improvement," top Russian officials said at a
meeting held today.
</P>
<P>
"Alexander Lebed's plan of action ... in Chechnya needs a lot
of work," the Interfax news agency reported. It did not make
Lebed's position clear.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin chaired the top-level
meeting at the request of President Boris Yeltsin. It was attended
by Lebed and defense, interior, secret services and justice
ministers and the speakers of both chambers of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin was reportedly "extremely worried" by what he said
were truce violations by the Chechen rebels, in particular their
forming of local administrations.
</P>
<P>
Lebed arranged a ceasefire in Chechnya last week and has been
trying to win the backing of Yeltsin and the government for his
plan.
</P>
<P>
Lebed told reporters today that he hopes Chechnya's
Moscow-backed government leader Doku Zavgayev, whom he had accused
of corruption, could resign voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
Lebed said he did not believe there would be any suggestion of
full independence but a "friendly coalition" close to the model
introduced in the mostly Muslim autonomous republic of Tatarstan
in central Russia.
</P>
<P>
"The establishment of any unilateral political power in
Chechnya means war," Itar-Tass quoted Lebed as saying.
</P>
<P>
Lebed is to travel to Chechnya Friday for new talks with
separatist leaders on a lasting political settlement aimed at
ending the war which has claimed tens of thousands of lives.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien said today that the sovereignty debate and continued
political instability have hurt the economy of the Canadian
province of Quebec.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with community leaders of a Quebec town, Chretien
said that whenever he talked to business people in the province,
they said they were afraid of investing because of its political
instability.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing is more nervous than 1 million dollars," Chretien was
quoted as saying by local media.
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't speak English or French and it leaves very
quickly," the prime minister said. "Investment is going up in the
rest of the country and decreasing here."
</P>
<P>
Chretien said he could not agree with the saying that the
weather is to be blamed for the troubled Quebec economy.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard suggested
that it was the weather that caused the recent economic woes in
the province's tourist industry.

BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Highlights of today's major
Beijing-based newspapers:
</P>
<P>
 "People's Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- A law that protects the rights and interests of the elderly
and one on the coal industry, and amendments to a law on mineral
resources were passed in Beijing Thursday by the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), and President
Jiang Zemin signed them into law.
</P>
<P>
-- President Jiang Zemin Thursday reaffirmed that economic
cooperation across the Taiwan Straits should not be affected or

meeting a group of Taiwanese scholars and personages from the
industrial and commercial circles in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
-- A front-page commentary denounces Japanese rightists'
provocative activities on the Diaoyu Islands, which are an
inalienable part of the Chinese territory. It calls on people from

</P>
<P>
 "Xinhua Daily Telegraph"
</P>
<P>
-- Chinese Government's efforts to build forest shelter in
areas along the upper reaches of the Yangtze River have paid

<HEADLINE> Japan's Unemployment Rate Slightly Down in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Japan's unemployment rate in July
dropped slightly to 3.4 percent, the Management and Coordination
Agency said today.
</P>
<P>
The 3.4 percent figure, a seasonally adjusted one, showed a
marginal fall of a 0.1 percentage point from the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The agency regarded 3.4 percent unemployment rate as still
high. It had reached a record 3.5 percent in May and stayed the
same in June, the highest level since 1953 when the current
calculating method was introduced.
</P>
<P>
An agency official saw corporate restructuring as the main
reason for the drop. Fewer people were now being forced out of job.
</P>
<P>
The agency's report showed that the number of unemployed
increased from a year earlier by 190,000 to 2.21 million. About
860,000 people left jobs voluntarily "due to a mismatch between
the job offered and sought," said the agency official.
</P>
<P>
The number of those who enterewd as new job seekers increased
60,000 to 580,000, of which women accounted for 250,000, up by
4,000.
</P>
<P>
Apparently, more women started seeking jobs on expectations
that the economy was improving and there would be more job
openings, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The agency saw good signs in the increase by 0.7 percent of
the total number of employed, to 65.89 million.

<P>
TIRANA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Macedonian government has
applied the United Nations Security Council for an extension of
the U.N. peace-keeping mission there for another six months, a
report from the Macedonian capital, Skopje, said today.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia asked the Security Council in late 1992 to deploy the
U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) along the country's northern and
eastern borders because of fear of the spread of the Bosnian war
into the former Yugoslav republic.
</P>
<P>
In March, 1995, after reinforcement of U.S. troops to the
700-member UNPROFOR presence, the operation was renamed the UN
Preventive Deployment Force (UNPREDEP).
</P>
<P>
The mission of the 1100-member UNPREDEP was to expire on
November 30.

<HEADLINE> Bruguera Ousts Stich to Reach U.S. Open Third Round </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Two-time French Open winner
Sergi Bruguera of Spain defeated former Wimbledon champion
Michael Stich of Germany 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 to reach the third round of
the U.S. Open Tennis Championships on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Nothing looked easy for Stich, who made 44 unforced errors
compared to just 12 for Bruguera.
</P>
<P>
Stich, the highest-ranked unseeded player in the tournament at
18th, managed to save three match points before succumbing on a
Bruguera service winner.
</P>
<P>
And the German was misfiring too often on his volleys and
spraying ground strokes long and wide.
</P>
<P>
The once third-ranked Bruguera, whose ranking has slipped to
73rd in the world during an injury-plagued year, admitted what
turned his year around was the Atlanta Olympic Games in which he
clinched the silver medal.
</P>
<P>
Joining Bruguera in the third round was 13th-seeded Swede
Thomas Enqvist, who made short work of Frenchman Guillaume Raoux
6-3, 6-2, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old Enqvist, who reached the quarter-finals of the
Australian Open this year for his best career Grand Slam showing,
did not face a single break point in the 90-minute match.
</P>
<P>
Women's top seed and defending champion Steffi Graf needed only
52 minutes to beat Austrian Karen Kschwendt 6-2, 6-1 to take one
step closer to her fifth U.S. Open title.
</P>
<P>
Graf's third-round rival will be 27-ranked Natasha Zvereva of
Belarus, who outplayed 26th-ranked rising Japanese player Ai
Sugiyama 4-6, 6-4, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Fourteenth seed Barbara Paulus of Austria, the only other seed
left in Graf's quarter, also advanced with a 7-5, 7-6 win over
Elena Wagner of Germany.
</P>
<P>
And 15-year-old Russian prodigy Anna Kournakova moved easily
into the third round after a 6-3, 6-3 win over Italian Natalia
Baudone.

<P>
HAVANA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Cuba is expecting the permanent
council of the Organization of American States (OAS) to ratify its
ruling against the U.S. Helms-Burton Law.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministry spokeswoman Marianela Ferriol told reporters
that the ruling, moved by the OAS judicial committee last week,
demonstrates that the objective of the controversial
U.S. legislation was understood in the OAS.
</P>
<P>
The judicial committee declared the Helms-Burton Law in
violation of international law, following a resolution by the OAS
General Assembly in June.
</P>
<P>
Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina on Monday described the
OAS ruling as "unprecedented". The OAS General Assembly rejected
the law 23-1.
</P>
<P>
United States President Bill Clinton signed the Helms-Burton
bill into law in March after Cuba shot down two American civil
planes piloted by Cuban exiles.
</P>
<P>
The law aims at toughening a 35-year-old embargo against the
Caribbean island nation.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Market Sluggish in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The Olympic Games proved to be
a gold-winner for TV sales in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
People wanting to watch the action in Atlanta on new color
television sets, sent sales soaring by almost eleven percent in
July in China's biggest city.
</P>
<P>
A total of 28,000 TV sets - many of them big screen models -
were snapped up by Olympic fans.
</P>
<P>
But TV sales were in sharp contrast to the overall Shanghai
market in July which was relatively sluggish.
</P>
<P>
Sales of consumer goods in July saw the lowest growth this
year, statistics indicated.
</P>
<P>
Sales volume of consumer goods in the month totalled 9.32
billion yuan (about 112 million US dollars), increasing 13.2
percent over a year earlier. But adjusted for inflation, the
actual increase rate was 8.8 percent, the lowest of all monthly
growth rates this year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the plunge to the the plum rains the
typhoon rainstorms.
</P>
<P>
Affected by the climate, the sales of fruit, vegetables and
aquatic products in July were down on the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The decrease was offset by an increase in the sales of pork,
poultry, eggs and bean-based products.
</P>
<P>
In July, sales of clothing totalled 1.135 billion yuan,
increasing 13.1 percent. But the structure of the sales of
best-selling products has changed. The prices of garments were
falling while that of textile cloth was rising. This has in part
reflected the higher prices of ready-made clothes.
</P>
<P>
From January to July, retail sales of consumer goods in
Shanghai totalled 65.631 billion yuan, up 21.1 percent. Adjusted
for inflation, the actual increase was 14.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Minister Denies Contact With Exiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto
Robaina today denied any kind of contact with radical opposition
groups of exiles in the state of Florida of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Robaina told the Cuban press agency "Prensa Latina" that the
Florida radical opposition was "Mafia members linked to the
U.S. gangster world, whose only purpose has been to get rich in
the service of those who intended to rob Cuba of its sovereignty".
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing to talk about with those people and that is
the official and consistent policy of the Cuban government," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Press reports published in Florida about an alleged dialogue
between the Cuban government and the exiles was aimed at causing
confusion about the Cuban policy, said the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Robaina said that Havana has tried to maintain links with those
Cubans who live abroad but respect their residence country and
reject the U.S. blockade and all kinds of punitive measures
against the land of their birth.

<HEADLINE> China Sees Big Progress in Impact Injury Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- China has made great
progress in impact injury research, doctors have revealed.
</P>
<P>
Since the country's first impact injury laboratory was built in
1990, various biological impact machines have been developed, and
a range of successful tests in combating impact injury have been
made, according to a military medical college.
</P>
<P>
Research work is aimed at improving the ability of vehicles to
offer greater protection for drivers and passengers, and reducing
the death toll and injuries caused by traffic accidents.
</P>
<P>
Over 60,000 people a year across the country have been killed
in traffic accidents every year since 1993, surpassing the total
caused by natural disasters, such as earthquakes, floods and
rainstorms.
</P>
<P>
Impact injury study in China began with clinical field surgery
research in the late 1980s, the doctors from the Chongqing-based
military medical college said.
</P>
<P>
So far, a number of research projects in brain injuries, and
lung and backbone damage, have been completed and some new
findings in static and dynamic impact have been made, the doctors
said.
</P>
<P>
To promote the development and research in the field, the state
will supply more money to finance impact injury research project
as a national key project, they said.

PANAMA CITY, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Some 230 bankers from Latin
America and the United States met here today to exchange
information on ways to combat financial crimes.
</P>
<P>
At a two-day forum entitled "The International Congress on the

<HEADLINE> Boardman Breaks World Record Again on Way to Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Briton Chris Boardman won the
4,000 meters individual pursuit Thursday with a new world record
at the world cycling championships in Manchester, Britain.
</P>
<P>
Boardman's time of 4:11.114 in the fianl took more than two
seconds off his previous record of 4:13.353 set in the qualifying
round on Wednesday, beating Olympic champion Andrea Collinelli of
Italy, a report said.
</P>
<P>
Before Boardman's first world record ride Wednesday, Collinelli
owned the mark, setting it at the Olympics in Atlanta but some six
seconds slower than both the British rider's times in Manchester.
</P>
<P>
In Thursday's final, Collinelli was a distant loser, his time,
4:20.341, being some nine seconds slower.
</P>
<P>
Boardman, gold medalist of the Barcelona Olympic Games four
years ago, started off slowly and was behind the Italian after the
opening kilometer, but the Briton narrowed Colinelli's lead to
1.242 seconds as the pair entered the second half of the race.
</P>
<P>
As the Italian's fast start took its toll, Boardman drew level
and then pulled decisively ahead in the final two laps. As
Colinelli's resistance ebbed away, the Briton ran out a wholly
convincing winner.
</P>
<P>
In other medal action, Australia's all-star Olympic sprint
trio proved too fast for reigning champions Germany in the final.
</P>
<P>
Darryn Hill, Shane Kelly and Gary Neiwand -- all current or
former world champions -- won the 750-meter event in 44.804
seconds.
</P>
<P>
It was Kelly's second world title less than 24 hours after his
victory in the one kilometre time trial on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> ValuJet to Return to Sky Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New York, August 29 (Xinhua) -- ValuJet, the low-fare airline
of the U.S. which was ordered to stop operation in June 18 to
enhance its safety measures, is soon able to return to the sky
with approval of the Federal Aviation Administration.
</P>
<P>
ValuJet President Lewis Jordan said the airline had gone "above
and beyond in achieving the highest level of safety at ValuJet."
</P>
<P>
ValuJet was grounded in June because of concerns over its
maintenance procedures. A May 11 crash in the Florida Everglades
that killed all 110 aboard drew attention on the airline. But it
had been under scrutiny by regulators since last year for a series
of incidents including planes sliding off runways and a fire,
according to earlier reports.
</P>
<P>
The FAA said it returned the airline's operating certificate
Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The airline has undergone an extensive safety investigation
during the time it was not allowed to fly.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Expressed Concern over Human Rights in Croatia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 29 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali said on Thursday that the Croatian Serbs
remained by far the most common victims of violent assaults.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the Security Council on the situation of human
rights in Croatia, Boutros-Ghali said a prevailing climate of
lawlessness causing great fear among local residents persisted in
the former Serb-controlled areas, particularly in the area around
Knin.
</P>
<P>
"It is evident that the government still has not taken adequate
measures to provide an effective police presence in the region,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that much progress remained to be made by the
Croatian authorities as regards the investigation and prosecution
of past violations of international humanitarian law and human
rights against the local Serb population.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the return of refugees, the Secretary-General
said the process was moving slowly, noting that while the
government had authorized the return to Croatia of more than 9,000
Croatian Serbs, fewer than a quarter of those individuals had
returned.
</P>
<P>
While some positive steps had been taken such as the
establishment of various government bodies to promote human rights
and reinforced cooperation with international human rights
mechanisms, the overall approach of the government to the rights
of Croatian Serbs in Croatia had so far failed to encourage
confidence within the Serb Population, he said.

LONDON, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Leading European stock markets

slipping below the 3,900 support level and French stocks dipping
the most, hit by additional concerns over industrial unrest in the
Autumn.
</P>

in the US which raised fears of a US interest rate hike.

The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British
shares ended down 33.7 points, the biggest fall since July 24.
</P>

most, slipping 1.27 percent on a weak franc and fears that the
unions are preparing to mount a challenge to the government in the
Autumn over its social and economic policies.
</P>
<P>
The Frankfurt bourse, also hit by the surprisingly strong US
growth figures and a weak dollar, fell 3.10 points on the DAX-30
index.
